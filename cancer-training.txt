In the present study, we examined the ability of chymostatin,
a  highly  specific  inhibitor  of  chymotrypsin,  to  suppress
dimethylhydrazine-induced  colon  carcinogenesis,  and  the
dose-response  relationship  for  an  extract  of  soybeans
containing  the  Bowman -Birk  inhibitor  (BBI)  to  suppress
dimethylhydrazine-induced  colon carcinogenesis, when added
to  the  diet  of  mice.  Our  results  showed  that:  (i)  diets
containing  0.1%  BBI  reduced  the  incidence  of  adeno-
carcinomas  of  the  colon  - 5 0 %,  but  had  no  effect  on  the
incidence  of  squamous  cell  carcinomas  of  the  anal  gland;
(ii) the suppressive effect  requires protease inhibitor  activity,
as the autoclaved BBI, in which all protease inhibitory activity
has  been  destroyed,  was  ineffective  at  suppressing  the
incidence  of  adenocarcinomas;  (iii) chymostatin  suppressed
the incidence of squamous cell carcinomas of the anal  gland,
but  not  adenocarcinomas  of  the  colon;  and  (iv) the  growth
rates of the animals were the same in each of the experimental
groups. Our  results indicate that the levels of anticarcinogenic
protease  inhibitors  present  in  the  diets  of  these  animals  do
not have any adverse effects  on the growth or  general  health
of  the  animals.

Introduction
Cancer  of the colon  and  rectum  is the second  leading  cause of
cancer death  in US adults (1).  In the United  States,  ~  130 000
new cases of colon cancer are reported each year and colon cancer
accounts  for  about  60 000 deaths  annually.  The  incidence  and
mortality rates of colon cancer have remained unchanged for the
last 50 years (1,2). Since colon cancer has been largely  refractory
to contemporary treatment regimens (2), an alternative approach
to  controlling  this  disease  is  through  prevention.  Cancer
prevention via dietary means may well be the most  cost-effective
approach  towards  controlling  this  disease.

Epidemiological  data  suggest  that  nutritional  factors  play  a
major role in the etiology of cancer at many different  sites (3-7).
For example, high dietary levels of legumes have been associated
with low cancer rates in general and are inversely correlated with
the  incidences  of  breast,  colon  and  prostate  cancer  (3,6,7).
Legumes are  known  to contain  high concentrations  of  protease
inhibitors (8), as well as other agents (such as lectins, etc.) which
may  modify  carcinogenesis.  Protease  inhibitors  have  been
shown  to  have  anticarcinogenic  activity  in  vivo  and  in  vitro
(e.g.  9-22).  We  have  reported  that  the  soybean-derived
Bowman-Birk  inhibitor  (BBI*)  (8,23)  suppresses  dimethyl-
hydrazine (DMH)-induced colon and liver carcinogenesis in mice,
when  present  in  the diet  (17,20),  7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthra-

cene-induced  cheek  pouch  carcinogenesis  in  hamsters,  when
topically  applied  (16),  and  3-methylcholanthrene-induced  lung
tumorigenesis in mice (21). BBI has also been shown to suppress
carcinogen-induced  malignant  transformation  in  vitro (9,22).

In general,  inhibitors of chymotrypsin  have been  found  to be
the  most  effective  suppressors  of  transformation  in  vitro (15).
For example, nanomolar concentrations of chymostatin, a highly
specific  inhibitor  of  chymotrypsin  (24),  have  been  shown  to
inhibit  radiation-induced  transformation  of  C3H/10T1/2  cells
(14,15).  In  the  current  experiments,  we  have  continued  our
studies  examining  the  ability  of  the  BBI  to  suppress  colon
carcinogenesis and have also examined the effect  of chymostatin
on  colon  carcinogenesis.

Materials  and  methods
Chemicals
The  BBI was obtained  from  Central  Soya  (Fort Wayne,  IN) and  was prepared
as  described  (17).  Chymostatin  was  obtained  from  the  US/Japan  Cooperative
Cancer Research Program.  1,2-Dimethylhydrazine  dihydrochloride was obtained
from  Aldrich.  Stock  solutions of DMH were freshly  prepared  in  1  mM  EDTA
and  adjusted  to  pH  6.5  with  NaOH  before  each  set  of  injections.
Preparation of autoclaved  BBI  (ABBI) and  succinylated BBI (SBBI)
ABBI was prepared by autoclaving  BBI for  30 min.  SBBI was prepared  by the
method of Smirnoff  (25). Briefly,  BBI was dissolved  in distilled water (5 mg/ml)
and brought to pH 9 by the addition of  1  N NaOH. Succinic anhydride was added
(in a ratio of 0.5 g succinic anhydride/g BBI), the sample was stirred and maintained
at pH 8 -9  by the dropwise addition of  1  N NaOH. After 2 h, additional succinic
anhydride was added  and the reaction  was allowed  to proceed  for  an additional
2 h.  Next, the pH was adjusted  to 3.5  by the addition  of concentrated  HC1, the
sample was centrifuged  (10 000 g  x  30 min, 4°C), and the pellet was resuspended
in distilled water, dialyzed against distilled  water (three changes, overnight) and
lyophilized to dryness. The modified  (succinylated) BBI was assayed for its ability
to inhibit chymotrypsin and trypsin; chymotrypsin  inhibitory activity was present
while  >99%  of  the  trypsin  inhibitory  activity  of  BBI  was  lost.
Animals
Eight  week  old  male  CD-I  mice  were  obtained  from  Charles  River  Breeding
Laboratories (Wilmington, MA), and upon arrival in the laboratory were randomly
assorted  into treatment  groups,  housed  three  mice  per  cage  and  placed  on  the
experimental  diets.  The  animals  were  maintained  in  a  controlled  environment
animal facility at 25°C with a  12 h light/dark cycle, and received  food and water
ad  libitum. The  mice  were  fed  a  modification  of diet  no.  101  from  Bio  Serve
(Frenchtown, NJ), a methionine-supplemented  diet based on guidelines from the
American Institute of Nutrition for a purified diet for rats and mice (26). Animals
receiving  protease  inhibitor  supplements  also  received  diet  no.  101  with  20%
dietary protein, with the protease inhibitor supplement replacing various percentages
of the casein component of the diet. All animals were weighed at weekly intervals
and received  weekly  i.p.  injections  of  DMH. The DMH  injections began when
the mice were  10 weeks old, after  a 2 week adaptation to the experimental diets
and continued for 20 weeks. The animals were killed by cervical extension.  For
histopathological  analysis, any macroscopically  abnormal organs, as well as the
colon and pancreas, were removed from each mouse. The pancreas was weighed
and examined  for  grossly  observable tumors or other abnormalities.  The entire
colon  was examined  and  the  distance  between  the  anus  and  any  visible  tumor
was measured. The section of the colon containing the tumor was then excised.
In addition  to the abnormal  sections of the colon,  normal  appearing areas  from
each of the three major regions (representing the entire length of the colon) were
taken from each mouse for histopathologic analysis. These sections, the tumors,
pancreata  and  any  macroscopically  abnormal  tissues  were  preserved  in  10%
buffered  formalin and embedded in paraffin;  4 -5  /an thick sections were prepared
and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Benign and malignant colon tumors were
classified  as  described  (27).  Pathological  analysis  was  performed  without
knowledge  of  the  treatment  group  to  which  the  animals  belonged.

Results
The  current  studies  were designed  to determine  the ability  and
dose—response  relationship  of  various  preparations  of  BBI to
suppress DMH-induced colon carcinogenesis in mice. A second
objective of the study was to determine whether chymostatin has
the ability to suppress colon carcinogenesis. The mice were given
DMH  injections  while maintained  on diets containing:  (i) 0.1%
(1 part per  1000), 0.01 % (0.1 part per  1000) or 0.0005% (0.005
part  per  1000) of the BBI extract;  (ii) chymostatin,  a low  mol.
wt chymotrypsin  inhibitor  (24); and  (iii)  modified  preparations
containing  ABBI  (autoclaving  destroys  all  chymotrypsin  and
trypsin inhibitory activity) or SBBI [this BBI preparation has been
treated  with succinic anhydride, which  specifically  succinylates
a critical  lysine residue (Lysl6)  in the trypsin inhibitory portion
of  the  BBI  molecule.  This  covalent  modification  selectively
removes the trypsin inhibitory activity, leaving the chymotrypsin
inhibitory  activity  intact  (17,25)].  The  experimental  group
receiving  ABBI  also served  as an  isocaloric  diet  control  group
for the treatment groups receiving the various BBI preparations.
In  the  first  series  of  experiments,  DMH-induced  adeno-
carcinomas  in  the  colon  in  63%  of  the  animals;  0.1% BBI in
the  diet  significantly  reduced  the  incidence  of  these  tumors  in
the  DMH-treated  animals to 34.8%  (Table I). At 0.01 % of the
diet, BBI produced an insignificant  decrease in tumor incidence,
while dietary  levels of 0.0005%  BBI, 0.1 % ABBI, 0.1 % SBBI
or  0.1 % chymostatin  had  no  effect  on  the  induction  of adeno-
carcinomas  (Table  I).

Interestingly,  a  different  pattern  of  tumor  suppression  was
observed  when  we  compared  the  incidence  of  squamous  cell
carcinomas  of the anal gland  in animals  fed  the different  diets.
The BBI had no effect  on the incidence of anal  gland tumors in
these animals,  while  a suppressive  effect  on  these tumors was
observed  with a diet supplemented  with chymostatin  (Table II).
We performed  two additional  sets of experiments  to determine
the  effects  of  chymostatin  on  gastro-intestinal  tract  tumors.  In
these  studies,  DMH  injections  (15  mg/kg  in  experiment  1 and
20 mg/kg in experiment 2) were given for 20 weeks; the animals
were killed 6 months after the beginning of carcinogen  injections.
As two different  experiments  were performed  to determine the
effect  of chymostatin  on colon  carcinogenesis,  we analyzed out
data using the likelihood ratio chi-squared test (GLIM Statistical
Package,  Royal  Statistical  Society)  to  rule  out  the  effect  of
experimental  variation.  Using this analysis, we found  that there

these  studies  demonstrate  that  chymostatin  had  a  significant
suppressive effect  on DMH-induced  squamous cell  carcinomas
of  the  anal  gland  but  had  no effect  on  adenomatous  tumors of
the  colon  (Table  IH).

It has been  reported  that high  levels of protease  inhibitors in
the diet can lead to reduced growth rates, resulting from decreased
protein utilization, as well as pathologic changes in the pancreas
(28-30).  Consequently,  the  animals  were  weighed  at  weekly
intervals to assess their rate of growth; no difference  in the growth
rates for animals in any of the experimental groups was observed.
The  pancreata  from  the  animals  in each  group  were  dissected
out and weighed. No difference  in the ratio of pancreas wt/body
wt was observed between those animals on the control diet and
those receiving diets containing protease  inhibitor.  Further,  the
protease  inhibitor-containing  diets  had  no  effect  on  the  gross
appearance  or  histopathological  characteristics  of  the  pancreas
in  these  studies.

Discussion

In the present  study,  we have utilized  the DMH-induced  colon
carcinogenesis  model  to  study  the  inhibition  of  colon  carcino-
genesis in mice by dietary protesae inhibitors. Our results support
our  previous  findings  that  dietary  intake  of  BBI  will  suppress
adenomatous tumors of the colon (17,20). BBI was an  effective
anticarcinogenic agent when present at a concentration of 0.1 %,
while  lower  concentrations  of  the  inhibitor  were  less  effective
or ineffective  at reducing tumor  incidence. Consequently, these
studies, in addition to previous work (17), suggest that the 0.1 %
level  of the BBI extract  is the minimal  concentration  necessary
for a significant  reduction  in adenomatous tumors of the colon.
Lower  levels  of  dietary  BBI  are  still  effective  at  suppressing
tumors  at  other  sites;  however,  at  0.01% of  the diet,  the BBI
extract has been shown to suppress DMH-induced angiosarcomas
of the liver  (17).  It  should  be  noted  that  the levels  of  protease
inhibitors shown to be anticarcinogenic in our studies are roughly
comparable (on a mg/kg basis) to the estimated intake of protease
inhibitors  by  specific  human  populations  consuming  relatively
high  levels of dietary  protease  inhibitors,  such as the Japanese
and Seventh Day Adventists (17). These populations have been
shown to have lower than normal incidences of breast, colon and
prostate cancer (3-7);  it is possible that the low cancer incidence
in these populations could be, at least in part, attributable to their
dietary  intake  of  anticarcinogenic  protease  inhibitors.

The  inability  of  ABBI  to  suppress  the  formation  of  adeno-
carcinomas  provides  strong  evidence  that  protease  inhibitory
activity  is necessary  for  tumor  suppression.  We  also  observed
that SBBI had no effect  on colon carcinogenesis in these studies.
SBBI contains chymotrypsin  inhibitory  activity  but has had the
trypsin inhibitory activity of BBI selectively removed. A number
of different  explanations  are possible  for  our  results showing a
lack of suppression  of carcinogenesis by SBBI. Although  SBBI
still  retains the ability  to suppress  transformation  in vitro, it is
not known whether it has the same ability as BBI to pass through
the stomach  in an  intact  form  and  enter  the intestine  in a  form
capable of interacting  with proteases.  Even  if SBBI does reach
the intestine as an active protease  inhibitor,  it may not be taken
up by the colonic epithelial cells as efficiently  as BBI and, thus,
may not be able to interact with, and inhibit, the critical enzymes
in these  cells.  Additionally,  SBBI  may  be  more  water  soluble
than  the  native  inhibitor  and,  hence,  may  be  more  rapidly
excreted. Alternatively, the trypsin inhibitory portion of BBI may
play an important role in inhibiting adenomatous colonic tumors.

in  vitro  by 

tumor  promoters 

We  have  observed  previously  that  SBTI  (a  strong  inhibitor  of
trypsin)  does  not  directly  suppress  radiation  transformation  in
vitro,  but  will  suppress  the  enhancement  of  radiation-induced
transformation 
(12,13).
Consequently, while chymotrypsin inhibitors are likely to be the
most potent anticarcinogenic  agents, trypsin  inhibitors,  such as
SBTI,  may  also  have  cancer  chemopreventive  value  by  virtue
of their ability to inhibit the promotional phase of carcinogenesis.
Thus,  tumor  promotion  may  play  an  important  role  in  the
development of adenomatous tumors arising in the large bowel.
While  BBI  suppressed  the  incidence  of  adenocarcinomas  of
the colon, it did not affect  the incidence of anal gland squamous
cell  tumors.  In contrast,  chymostatin  suppressed  the  incidence
of squamous cell tumors in the anal gland, but had no effect  on
adenocarcinomas of the colon. Several factors could account for
these  results,  (i)  The  critical  target  enzymes  involved  in  the
malignant transformation  of the cells of the colon and anal gland
are  different.  Presumably,  BBI  would  be  a  more  effective
inhibitor  of  the  critical  target  enzymes  in  the  colon  while
chymostatin  is more effective  at inhibiting these enzymes in the
cells  lining  the  anal  gland,  (ii)  BBI  may  be  absorbed  more
efficiently  by the epithelial cells lining the colon while chymostatin
may  be more  effectively  absorbed  by the epithelial  cells  lining
the anal gland.  While BBI is water  soluble, chymostatin  is not,
and hence its distribution in the gastrointestinal tract contents may
not favor uptake by the critical epithelial cells lining the gut. The
fact that chymostatin is fat soluble could also explain its selective
ability to affect  anal gland carcinogenesis.  Consequently,  water
solubility may be an important characteristic of protease inhibitors
for  the  suppression  of  adenomatous  tumors  of  the  colon.

It  is  somewhat  surprising  to  us  that  BBI  does  not  affect
squamous cell carcinomas of the anal gland, as it has previously
been shown to suppress squamous cell carcinomas of the hamster
cheek pouch (16). As discussed elsewhere (17), the cells of origin
of  squamous cell carcinomas are markedly  different  in the oral
and  anal  gland  epithelium,  which  perhaps  accounts  for  the
observed differences  in the ability of BBI to affect  carcinogenesis
at  these  two  sites.

The  ability  of  protease  inhibitors  to  suppress  carcinogenesis
appears to vary greatly with the dose of carcinogen  administered.
BBI  has  previously  been  shown 
to  prevent  completely
adenomatous tumors of the gastrointestinal tract when the doses
of DMH utilized were such that a considerably  lower percentage
of  the  animals  developed  tumors  than  observed  in  the  present
study (17,20). We observed that BBI was capable of suppressing

Chemopreventive  agents  appear  to act  similarly  in other  organ

The results from  this study support our previous findings  that
non-toxic levels of BBI can suppress the development of murine
adenomatous colon tumors, which are histopathologically  similar
to those  that  occur  in  the  most  common  form  of  human  colon
cancer.  Indeed,  the  colon  cancer  model  utilized  in the  present
studies is considered to be a representative model  for the human
disease  (31).  Thus,  BBI  may  have  the  potential  to  lower  the
incidence  of  colon  cancer  in  the  human  population.

Abstract

One promising approach for early detection of lung cancer is by monitoring gene promoter hypermethyla-
tion events in sputum. Epidemiologic studies suggest that dietary fruits and vegetables and the micronutrients
they contain may reduce risk of lung cancer. In this study, we evaluated whether diet and multivitamin use
influenced the prevalence of gene promoter methylation in cells exfoliated from the aerodigestive tract of
current and former smokers. Members (N = 1,101) of the Lovelace Smokers Cohort completed the Harvard
Food Frequency Questionnaire and provided a sputum sample that was assessed for promoter methyla-
tion of eight genes commonly silenced in lung cancer and associated with risk for this disease. Methyl-
ation status was categorized as low (fewer than two genes methylated) or high (two or more genes
methylated). Logistic regression models were used to identify associations between methylation status
and 21 dietary variables hypothesized to affect the acquisition of gene methylation. Significant protection
against methylation was observed for leafy green vegetables [odds ratio (OR) = 0.83 per 12 monthly servings; 95%
confidence interval (95% CI), 0.74–0.93] and folate (OR, 0.84 per 750 μg/d; 95% CI, 0.72–0.99). Protection against
gene methylation was also seen with current use of multivitamins (OR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.40–0.83). This is the first
cohort-based study to identify dietary factors associated with reduced promoter methylation in cells exfo-
liated from the airway epithelium of smokers. Novel interventions to prevent lung cancer should be developed
based on the ability of diet and dietary supplements to affect reprogramming of the epigenome. Cancer Res;

Introduction

Lung cancer, the leading cause of cancer-related death in
the United States, occurs largely from chronic exposure to
tobacco carcinogens (1). The development of this disease
over 30 to 40 years involves field cancerization, characterized
as the acquisition of genetic and epigenetic changes through-
out the respiratory epithelium (2, 3). The silencing of genes
through promoter hypermethylation is now recognized as a
major and causal epigenetic event that occurs during lung
cancer initiation and progression to affect the function of
hundreds of genes. Gene silencing involves methylation of cy-

tosines in the gene promoter region, recruitment of tran-
scriptional corepressors, and modification of histone tails
that culminate in the establishment of chromatin modifica-
tions that block transcription (4, 5). Genes involved in all as-
pects of normal cell function, such as regulating the cell
cycle, differentiation, adhesion, and death, are silenced in
lung tumors (3). Importantly, the tumor suppressor gene
p16, which plays a critical role in regulating the cell cycle,
is not only commonly silenced by methylation in lung cancer
but also inactivated early in the development of this disease.
Silencing of p16 and other genes is detected in bronchial ep-
ithelium of smokers and in precursor lesions to adenocarci-
noma and squamous cell carcinoma and increases during
disease progression, substantiating a vital role for gene si-
lencing in lung cancer etiology (6–8).

Based on the silencing of key tumor suppressor genes in the
lungs of smokers, we hypothesized that the detection of gene-
specific promoter hypermethylation in exfoliated cells in
sputum would provide an assessment of the extent of field can-
cerization that in turn may predict early lung cancer. This
hypothesis has been validated in two studies, the first detecting
methylation of the p16 and MGMT genes in sputum up to 3
years before clinical diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma (9).
The second study, a nested, case-control study of incident
lung cancer cases from a high-risk cohort, identified six genes
associated with >50% increased lung cancer risk. Importantly,

concomitant methylation of three or more of these six genes
was associated with a 6.5-fold increased risk of incident lung
cancer and sensitivity and specificity both at 64% (10). These
studies suggested that gene promoter hypermethylation in spu-
tum could be used as a molecular marker for identifying people
at high risk for cancer incidence (11). However, the precise
mechanism by which carcinogens disrupt the capacity of cells
to maintain the epigenetic code during DNA replication and re-
pair is largely unknown.

The fact that gene promoter methylation is a promising
marker for lung cancer makes understanding factors that in-
fluence the propensity for this epigenetic process throughout
the respiratory epithelium a high priority because such
knowledge could be used not only for early detection but also
to identify persons who would benefit most from chemopre-
vention. The precise mechanism by which carcinogens dis-
rupt the capacity of cells to maintain the epigenetic code
during DNA replication and repair is largely unknown. Carci-
nogens within tobacco induce single- and double-strand
breaks in DNA, and reduced DNA repair capacity (DRC)
has been associated with lung cancer (12). Accumulating ev-
idence from our group suggests that extensive DNA damage
could be responsible for acquisition of gene promoter hyper-
methylation during lung carcinogenesis (3, 13). Strong sup-
port for this supposition was provided through a recent
community-based study in which a highly significant associ-
ation was seen between DRC and sequence variants within
specific DNA repair genes and the propensity for methylation
of genes detected in sputum from cancer-free smokers from
the Lovelace Smokers Cohort (14). Specifically, smokers with
a high methylation index (defined by having three or more
genes methylated from an eight-gene panel in sputum) had
a 50% reduction in DRC compared with smokers with no
genes methylated in sputum. Single nucleotide polymorph-
isms within five double-strand break DNA repair genes were
also highly associated with methylation index. This study
suggests that chronic DNA damage coupled with reduced
DRC could be an important determinant for inducing gene
promoter hypermethylation.

Epidemiologic studies suggest that select dietary nutrients
and vitamin supplements might protect against lung cancer
(15). Fruits, vegetables, and multivitamins all possess antiox-
idant activity that should reduce tobacco-induced DNA
damage. In addition, folate, a B vitamin, is metabolized to
5-methyltetrahydrofolate that provides methyl groups for S-
adenosylmethionine (SAM), a universal donor for reactions
that include methylation of DNA (16). Low folate has been as-
sociated with reduced DRC and an increase in prevalence for
gene promoter methylation (17, 18). The purpose of the cur-
rent investigation was to determine whether diet and multi-
vitamin use influence the presence of methylation in cells
exfoliated from the aerodigestive tract of current and former
smokers. Composite variables were selected based on our hy-
potheses that fruits, tomatoes, cruciferous vegetables, leafy
vegetables, yellow vegetables, and vitamin intake will be asso-
ciated with a reduction in number of genes methylated in
sputum, whereas animal fat and red and processed meat will
be associated with increased methylation.

Dietary Factors Protect against Gene Methylation in Smokers

Materials and Methods

Study population. The Lovelace Smokers Cohort began re-
cruitment of female smokers in 2001 and expanded to in-
clude male smokers in 2004 (14). Enrollment, which is still
ongoing, is restricted to current and former smokers ages
40 to 75 y with a minimum of 15 pack-years of smoking. Par-
ticipants primarily are residents of the Albuquerque, New
Mexico metropolitan area. Participants complete a standard
questionnaire covering demographics, smoking history, per-
sonal and family health, and a food frequency questionnaire.
Weight and height are measured. Participants provide both
blood and sputum samples and undergo standard pulmonary
function testing. A total of 1,145 people completed a food fre-
quency questionnaire and were assessed for prevalence for
methylation of eight genes in sputum. Those with caloric in-
take outside of gender-specific bounds (n = 44) were exclud-
ed, resulting in a total of 1,101 participants (845 women and
256 men) in this study. All participants signed a consent
form, and the Western Institutional Review Board approved
this project.

Dietary questionnaire. Participants completed the adult
version of the Harvard University Food Frequency Question-
naire Dietary Assessment form, a self-administered instru-
ment that includes ∼150 food items (19). The participant
indicates consumption frequency for most food items by
choosing 1 of 5 to 10 categories that vary depending on the
food item and can range from never to six or more servings
per day. A food group analysis was conducted to combine
food items to obtain estimates of intake of macronutrients
and micronutrients. We focused on factors known or sus-
pected of being associated with lung cancer or methylation.
Thus, the macronutrients animal fat and total fat and the
micronutrients vitamin C, vitamin E, folate (that included
supplements and fortified foods), carotene, α-carotene, β-
carotene, lycopene, lutein and zeaxanthin, and retinol were
examined. Alcohol, multivitamins, and cod liver oil intake
were also assessed as categorical variables. In a study of
eating patterns, Fung and colleagues (20) created a set of
38 composite variables using the food frequency question-
naire. Six of these composite variables, red and processed
meats, fruit, tomatoes, cruciferous vegetables, leafy green
vegetables, and yellow vegetables, were related to our hy-
potheses, so we calculated these variables.

Total caloric intake was assessed. People with either ex-
tremely low (n = 8) or extremely high (n = 36) intake were
excluded. Cutoffs for extremely low intake were <500 and
<800 calories for women and men, respectively. Extremely
high intake was defined as >3,500 and >4,200 calories for
women and men, respectively. It is standard to exclude par-
ticipants with at least 70 missing items on the food frequency
questionnaire, but none of our participants met this criteri-
on. Participants with missing data on individual food items
were excluded from analyses of these items.

Methylation-specific PCR. Eight genes (p16, MGMT, DAPK,
RASSF1A, PAX5α, PAX5β, GATA4, and GATA5) were selected
for analysis of methylation in sputum based on our previous
studies establishing their association with risk for lung

cancer (10, 21). DNA was isolated from sputum and modified
with bisulfite as described (10). Nested methylation-specific
PCR was used to detect methylated alleles from individual
genes in DNA recovered from the sputum samples as de-
scribed (21). Methylation index, the number of genes meth-
ylated in a sputum sample, was also defined. Sputum from
males and females was randomly selected and included in
batches of 96 samples for assessment of gene methylation.
A Hamilton robot was used to assemble PCRs in 96-well
plates.

Covariates. The questionnaire included questions on
gender, age, ethnicity, and smoking. Cigarette smoking histo-
ry included current status (former or current), pack-years,
and duration of smoking. Body mass index (BMI) was calcu-
lated from measured height and weight and categorized as
normal (<25 kg/m2), overweight (25–29.9 kg/m2), and obese
(≥30 kg/m2). Age was categorized as 40 to 54, 55 to 64, and
≥65 y. Pack-years of smoking were categorized as light (<29),
moderate (30–49), and heavy (≥50).

Statistical methods. Demographic, dietary, and methyla-
tion variables were summarized overall and by gender. Pro-
portions were used for categorical variables and medians
with the interquartile range (IQR) for continuous variables.
Differences between men and women in clinical covariates
and categorical dietary variables were assessed with Fisher's
exact test. For continuous dietary variables, a two-step linear
regression analysis was used to account for differences in to-
tal caloric intake between genders. In the first step, the die-
tary variable was regressed on the total caloric intake. In the
second step, the residuals from the first analysis were re-
gressed on gender, which resulted in an estimate of the dif-
ferences in the mean dietary variable after adjustment for
total caloric intake, along with 95% confidence intervals
(95% CI).

The total number of methylated genes in the eight-gene
panel was dichotomized into low (fewer than two genes
methylated) and high (two or more genes methylated). This
binary outcome, methylation status, was modeled with logis-
tic regression. Initially, only the clinical covariates gender,
age, BMI, and three smoking variables (status, pack-years,
and duration) were assessed. Interactions among the covari-
ates, including interactions with gender, were evaluated. Af-
ter the development of a model with only clinical covariates,
individual dietary variables were included, along with adjust-
ment for total caloric intake. Continuous variables, such as
total fat intake, were included as a continuous variable or
were categorized into quartiles, with the quartiles defined
by gender and the quartile medians used as the predictor va-
lues. Interactions between dietary variables and clinical cov-
ariates were assessed. Only the 21 dietary variables specific to
our hypothesis were examined to reduce the potential for
false-positive results. In addition, no formal adjustment for
multiple comparisons was made to reduce the chance of
false-negative results because this is one of the first studies
to examine the association between dietary factors and
methylation. However, the issue of examining multiple pre-
dictor variables is considered in the interpretation of the re-
sults. Methylation index was also used as the outcome

variable to further assess the association between methyla-
tion and dietary factors. Because the methylation index could
theoretically take on nine values, but actually took on only
seven, it was unclear that linear regression would be appro-
priate. Thus, results obtained from linear and ordinal logistic
regression were compared. The association between signifi-
cant dietary factors and each of the individual genes was ex-
plored using logistic regression models but viewed as
secondary analyses to reduce the issue of multiple compari-
sons. All statistical analyses were conducted in Statistical
Analysis System 9.2.

Results

Population characteristics. The demographics and smok-
ing history of the 1,101 participants are described in Table 1.
The Lovelace Smokers Cohort is largely composed of females
(76.7%) and non-Hispanic whites (77.8%). Median age was 56
years, with males slightly older than females. More than half of
the participants currently smoked, and median duration of
smoking was 33 years. There was no difference between
men and women with regard to smoking status or duration,
but men had significantly higher pack-years of smoking
(median = 39 pack-years for men versus 34 pack-years for
women).

Summary of dietary intake. The completion rate of the
food frequency questionnaire was excellent, as only 2.7% of

participants failed to respond to >10 items. Dietary informa-
tion was compiled for the 21 items of particular interest to
this study and included three macronutrients, nine micronu-
trients, six serving variables, and three categorical variables
(Table 2). The selection of these variables was based on our
hypotheses that fruits, tomatoes, cruciferous vegetables, leafy
vegetables, yellow vegetables, and vitamin intake will be as-
sociated with a reduction in number of genes methylated in
sputum, whereas animal fat and red and processed meat will
be associated with increased methylation. On average, men
had higher intake of total calories, but after adjustment for
caloric intake, women generally had higher consumption of
micronutrients and men had higher consumption of red
meat. There was no difference in vitamin usage, but men

were more likely to report having at least one alcoholic drink
per day.

Prevalence for gene promoter hypermethylation in
sputum. Methylation of an eight-gene panel that included
p16, MGMT, DAPK, RASSF1A, GATA4, GATA5, PAX5α, and
PAX5β was evaluated. Methylation of these genes is associated
with increased risk for lung cancer (10, 21). The prevalence
of methylation ranged from 1.1% and 0.0% for RASSF1A to
33.8% and 51.2% for GATA4 for women and men, respectively
(Table 3). Three genes, MGMT, GATA4, and PAX5α, were more
frequently methylated among men than women (P < 0.001).
Methylation index, the number of methylated genes in each
sputum sample, was higher in men than women (median =
2 and 1, respectively; P < 0.001). Our previous study was

composed largely of male participants and dichotomized
methylation index as fewer than three or three or more
genes methylated in sputum (10). However, because this
study is composed of 77% women who have a lower prev-
alence for gene methylation, high methylation index was de-
fined as two or more genes methylated and was present in
sputum from 36.6% of women and 50.4% of men (P < 0.001).
Association of clinical covariates with gene methylation.
Gender, age, BMI, and cigarette smoking history were as-
sessed in a multivariate model for association with methyla-
tion status. Meaningful interactions, including interactions
between gender and all of the other covariates, were as-
sessed. There were significant interactions between gender
and both BMI (P = 0.04) and pack-years of smoking (P =
0.05). There were relatively more women with high methyla-
tion among obese participants than among both normal
weight and overweight individuals, whereas for men the as-
sociation was less consistent. The odds of high methylation
increased with pack-years among men, but there was no as-
sociation among women. Age and duration of smoking were

not associated with methylation, after adjustment for the
other clinical covariates, but age was retained in the model.
With two other smoking variables included in the model
(pack-years and current status), duration was excluded.
Thus, the clinical covariates that were included in the mod-
eling with the nutritional variables were gender, pack-years
of smoking, current smoking status, BMI, age, and interac-
tions between gender and both pack-years and BMI.

Association of dietary factors with gene methylation.
Each dietary factor was assessed for association with
methylation status (two or more genes methylated versus
fewer than two genes) using logistic regression. A total of
21 variables were examined: three macronutrients, nine mi-
cronutrients, six serving variables, and three categorical
variables (consumption of alcohol, vitamins, and cod liver
oil; Table 4; Supplementary Table S1). Leafy green vegetable
consumption was significantly associated with reduced risk
for high methylation status [odds ratio (OR), 0.83; 95% CI,
0.74–0.93], as was higher folate (OR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.72–0.99;
Table 4). The most striking effect seen was the association
between current multivitamin use and methylation status
(OR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.40–0.83; Table 4). The duration of
vitamin use was not associated with methylation (data
not shown). Moreover, because folate levels were higher
for participants taking multivitamins, stratification by vita-
min use was also conducted and folate remained signifi-
cantly associated with methylation. There was a marginal
increase in odds for methylation associated with total fat
and animal fat that did not reach statistical significance
(Supplementary Table S1). None of the other dietary or
nutrient predictor variables analyzed were associated with
methylation (Supplementary Table S1). Interactions be-
tween each dietary variable and gender were assessed, but
none was significant. The association between these dietary
variables and methylation of the individual genes also was
examined, but because of the number of tests (8 genes × 3
dietary variables = 24 tests), these results were viewed as
exploratory. Associations with at least one of the three sig-
nificant dietary variables were observed for DAPK, GATA4,
PAX5α, and PAX5β (Supplementary Table S2).

A further analysis was conducted to assess whether
any extreme outliers influenced the observed results for

continuous variables by defining quartiles by gender and
then using the medians within the quartiles as predictors
in logistic regression modeling. Similar results were obtained
as in the initial analysis, except that total fat was associated
with marginally increased methylation (OR, 1.43 per 40 g/d;
95% CI, 1.03–1.99). The same dietary variables were identified
to be significant in analyses that used the continuous meth-
ylation index as the outcome. In addition, vitamin E showed
a protective effect for methylation per gene (OR, 0.98 per 20
mg/d; 95% CI, 0.96–1.00; P = 0.04).

Discussion

This is the first cohort-based study to systematically eval-
uate the association between dietary factors and risk for
methylation in cells exfoliated from the aerodigestive tract
of smokers and former smokers. Our findings support a sig-
nificant, biologically plausible role for leafy green vegetables,
folate, and multivitamin use in protection against the acqui-
sition of gene promoter methylation.

There has been considerable interest and debate for dec-
ades about the effect of diet and vitamins on the risk for can-
cer. Recent large epidemiologic studies along with functional
investigations are beginning to provide a clearer picture as to
the dietary variables that may influence risk for cancers such
as lung where a clear causative environmental exposure in
the form of smoking has been established. Reduced folate in-
take has been associated with increased risk for lung cancer
in current and former smokers (22). A link between folate and
gene methylation exists through the role of 5-methyltetrahy-
drofolate in providing methyl groups for SAM, a key methyl
donor in the methylation of DNA. Higher folate has been as-
sociated with a lower prevalence for methylation of individ-
ual and total number of genes in colorectal tumors (17). This
finding was validated in a second study of colorectal tumors
in which folate was inversely associated with gene-specific
promoter hypermethylation (23). Our study shows for the
first time that the acquisition of gene promoter methylation
throughout the airway epithelium is influenced by folate. The
biological mechanisms related to low folate and hypermethy-
lation are still unclear; however, Jhaveri and colleagues (24)
suggested that folate deficiency leads to increased levels of
SAM and S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), an inhibitor of
SAM. The increase in free intracellular SAM could contribute
to gene-specific hypermethylation if an absolute level of SAH
needed to regulate SAM is not maintained. Folate is also in-
volved in DNA repair through de novo synthesis of purines
and pyrimidines, and low dietary folate has been associated
with reduced DRC (18). This observation, combined with our
recent study identifying reduced DRC as a determinant for gene
promoter methylation in sputum (14), suggests that folate may
directly, through affecting the one-carbon pool, and indirectly,
by affecting DRC, affect the propensity for methylation.

Green leafy vegetables were the only food item in this anal-
ysis to exhibit protection against methylation status. Leafy
vegetables are rich in phytochemicals such as vitamin C,
carotenoids, lutein, and folic acid in addition to vitamins A
and K. A comprehensive and systematic review of the litera-

Dietary Factors Protect against Gene Methylation in Smokers

ture up to 2007 by the World Cancer Research Fund (WCRF)
concluded that probable evidence existed for reduction of
lung cancer risk among persons with higher intake of fruits,
whereas evidence was inconclusive about green leafy vegeta-
bles (15). However, a recent hospital-based case-control
study of lung cancer (25) showed a strong protective effect
of green leafy vegetables (OR, 0.5; 95% CI, 0.3–0.81). The lack
of an effect of cruciferous vegetable on methylation status in
our study is not surprising because lung cancer observational
studies report only modest effects that may be influenced by
genetic variation (26). In addition, the lack of association
with red meat and processed meat intake is consistent with
the inconclusive evidence, as summarized by the WCRF (15).
However, a recent cohort study has observed increased risk
for lung cancer among those consuming meats prepared in
ways that would be expected to have increased their carcino-
genicity (27).

In our study, strong protection against gene methylation
was also associated with the use of multivitamins that contain
some of the same agents as leafy green vegetables. Although a
clear connection between vitamin supplements and risk of
lung cancer has not been established (28), vitamin supple-
mentation has been associated with reduction in DNA dam-
age by benzo(a)pyrene, a major tobacco carcinogen (29–32).
The silencing of genes by promoter hypermethylation is
now well established as a major component of lung cancer
initiation and progression and has emerged as a potential
disease marker for early detection. The ability to affect repro-
gramming of the epigenome through diet and chemopreven-
tive supplements could significantly affect mortality from
lung cancer. This study has identified two dietary variables,
leafy green vegetables and folate, along with multivitamin
use that could help reduce the incidence of lung cancer by
reducing the induction of methylation in the aerodigestive
tract of smokers.

Abstract

Purpose: We examined the feasibility of using gene
expression changes in human prostate epithelium as a
measure of response to a dietary intervention.
Materials and Methods: Eight men with newly diag-
nosed prostate cancer were randomized to a low-fat/
low-glycemic load intervention arm (<20% energy from
fat and total daily glycemic load <100) or a ‘‘standard

American’’ control arm (35% energy from fat and total
daily glycemic load >200). Prostate tissue was collected
before randomization and f6 weeks later, at the time
of radical prostatectomy. Epithelium was acquired by
laser capture microdissection, and transcript abun-
dance levels were measured by cDNA microarray
hybridization and confirmed by quantitative reverse
transcription-PCR.
Results: Men in the intervention arm consumed 39%
less total energy (P = 0.004) and the difference in

weight change between intervention and control arms

was  6.1 kg (P = 0.02). In the intervention arm, 23
(0.46%) of 5,711 cDNAs with measurable expression
were significantly altered (P < 0.05; false discovery rate,
V10%). In the control arm, there were no significant
changes in transcript expression, even when using a
false discovery rate as high as 50%.
Conclusions: A 6-week, low-fat/low-glycemic load diet
was associated with significant gene expression
changes in human prostate epithelium. These results
show the feasibility of using prostate tissues collected
at diagnosis and at surgery to study the effects of
dietary manipulation on prostate tissue, which may
give insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying
the associations of diet and obesity with the develop-

Introduction

There is good evidence that obesity and perhaps, a high
fat intake, due to its strong correlation with obesity,
increase the risk of high-grade or aggressive prostate
cancer, prostate cancer mortality, and the risk of poor
outcome following diagnosis and treatment (1-3). How-
ever, the molecular mechanisms underlying these asso-
ciations remains largely unknown. Experimental animal
and in vitro studies have shown that dietary patterns and

food constituents can affect gene expression, protein
synthesis, cell signaling, and other important events
related to carcinogenesis (4-6). In humans, however, it is
difficult to test hypotheses related to the mechanisms
and pathways that underlie diet and cancer associations
because appropriate tissues are rarely available. Human
studies are generally limited to measuring circulating
biomarkers, such as serum steroid hormones, which
are influenced by diet and are associated with carcino-
genesis.

The objective of this pilot study was to evaluate the
feasibility of a randomized clinical trial to test whether
short-term modifications in macronutrient intake could
modify gene expression in prostate epithelium. We
examined the effects of a low-fat/low-glycemic load
diet in men with clinically localized prostate cancer
who elected prostatectomy as their primary treatment
choice. These results will help in the design of studies
using gene expression or gene expression signatures as
measures of the effect of dietary change on prostate
cancer biology.

Materials and Methods

Participants were men with clinically localized prostate
cancer, who elected to undergo radical prostatectomy
and received no neoadjuvant therapy. Study activities
began within 2 weeks of diagnosis.

Eligibility criteria included the ability to implement
dietary change, no concurrent disease requiring dietary
modification, no current use of hormonal treatments, and
body mass index >20 kg/m2 and <35 kg/m2. In addition,
men had to have participated in an independent protocol
that collected and stored four prostate tissue cores at the
time of diagnostic prostate biopsy. Both the dietary
intervention and biopsy tissue collection protocols were
approved by the Institutional Review Boards of the
Veterans Administration, Puget Sound Health Care
System and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research
Center, and all patients signed written informed con-
sents. Study was completed between August 2003 and
November 2004.

Randomization and Dietary Intervention. Partici-
pants were randomly assigned to one of two groups:
group I received instructions to follow a low-fat/low-
glycemic load diet (<20% energy from fat and total daily
glycemic load <100) and group II was instructed to
follow a ‘‘standard American’’ diet (35% energy from fat
and total daily glycemic load >200). A detailed descrip-
tion of the intervention is available from the authors
upon request. In brief, participants were provided a
dietary intervention manual
focused on meal
planning. For individuals randomized to the low-fat/
low-glycemic load diet, the study nutritionist provided
detailed instructions and worked with the participant to
plan at least three meals. Participants randomized to the
standard American group were asked to continue their
usual dietary habits, using lists of prohibited and
permitted foods as a guideline for food choices. During
the first week, the nutritionist made up to five follow-up
telephone calls to review the intervention materials and
provide additional meal planning support; calls were
made at least once per week thereafter.

that

Dietary and Anthropometric Assessment. Unsched-
uled, telephone-administered 24-h dietary recalls were
completed each week to assess adherence to the study
diet, using the University of Minnesota’s Nutrition Data
Systems for Research software (version 37, 2006).
Interviewers were blinded to the randomization assign-
ment. On the days of randomization and prostatectomy,
participants were weighed by study staff on a beam
balance scale. Height was measured using a standing
stadiometer. Body mass index was calculated as weight
(kg) / height (m)2.

Clinical Specimens. At the time of biopsy and after
acquiring 12 diagnostic prostate cores, we obtained four
additional tissue cores from the peripheral zone. At the
time of radical prostatectomy, the prostate was exposed
via a midline incision, and we obtained four in situ
prostate biopsy cores using an 18-gauge prostate needle
biopsy gun (Bard Inc.). All biopsies were collected from
the peripheral zone and immediately embedded and
frozen as described below. Because our study was
limited to the effects of diet on normal epithelium, we
attempted to intraoperatively biopsy sites that did not

contain malignant epithelium, corresponding to sites
from diagnostic biopsy specimens. The in situ samples
were collected before removing the prostate because we
previously found that surgical manipulation caused
artifactual changes in gene expression (7).

Specimen Handling and Laser Capture Microdis-
section. Biopsy cores were embedded individually in
polyethylene glycol freezing media (Tissue-Tek OCT
Compound, Sakura Finetek), placed in isopentane that
was precooled in liquid nitrogen, and stored at  80jC
(8). We used laser capture microdissection to collect 5,000
epithelial cells from histologically benign epithelial
glands and extracted RNA using a standardized protocol
(9). The RNA was subjected to linear amplification and
converted to cDNA for microarray hybridization as
previously described (7).

Gene Expression Analysis by Microarray Hybridiza-
tion. We prepared and hybridized spotted cDNA micro-
arrays as previously described (10), using RNA from a
single batch of reference standards for each hybridiza-
tion. Fluorescent array images were collected for both
Cy3 and Cy5 using a GenePix 4000B fluorescent scanner
(Axon Instruments), and GenePix Pro 4.1 software was
used to grid and extract image intensity data. Spots of
poor quality, as determined by visual inspection, were
removed from further analysis. To normalize log ratio
data, a print tip – specific Lowess curve was fit to the
log-intensity versus log-ratio plot, using 20.0% of the
data to calculate the fit at each point. This curve was used
to center the log-ratio for each spot. Data were filtered
to exclude poorly hybridized cDNAs by removing values
with average foreground minus background intensity
levels less than 300. We used the average of the two
duplicate cDNA spots on each microarray chip in sub-
sequent analyses. Data were filtered to include clones
returning data for at least 75% of the samples in both
preintervention and postintervention groups, which
reduced the initial list of 6,751 clones to 5,711 clones
and 5,643 clones in the low-fat/low-glycemic load and
the standard American diet groups, respectively.

Statistical and Pathway Analyses. We used the
significant analysis of microarrays algorithm5 to analyze
differences in transcript levels between preintervention
and postintervention specimens (11). Paired, two-sample
t tests were calculated for each transcript, and genes
differentially expressed were identified using false
discovery rates (FDR) ranging from 5% to 50%.

Quantitative Reverse Transcription-PCR. We used
quantitative reverse transcription-PCR to validate micro-
array results for selected genes. Primers specific for the
genes of interest were designed using the web-based
primer design service Primer3 provided by the White-
head Institute for Biomedical Research.6 We determined
acceptable performance characteristics of the PCR pri-
mers using normal human prostate cDNA, Biolase Taq
polymerase (Bioline Inc.), and the GeneAmp PCR system
9700 (Applied Biosystems) as previously described (8).

described. Relative quantification of gene expression by
quantitative PCR (40 cycles of 60jC annealing, 72jC
extension, and 95jC melting) was done on a 7700
Sequence Detector using SYBR Green Master mix and
gene-specific primers following the manufacturer’s rec-
ommendations.

Results

Participant Demographic and Clinical Characte-
ristics. Median participant age was 64 years (range,
59-69), median body mass index was 29 (range, 23-35),
median preoperative serum prostate-specific antigen was
5.2 ng/mL (range, 2.5-16.0), median prostate volume
was 50 mL (range, 35-149), and all but one participant
was Caucasian.

Intervention Effects on Diet and Weight. The
intervention resulted in profoundly different dietary

patterns in the two study arms (Table 1). Compared
with men in the standard American arm, participants in
the low-fat/low-glycemic load arm consumed 39% less
total energy, 46% less fat, 42% less carbohydrate, and
62% more fiber, and had a 51% lower glycemic load. The
intervention effect for weight, defined as the difference in
weight change between study arms adjusted for baseline
weight, was 6.1 kg (95% confidence interval, 1.6-10.5 kg;
P = 0.02).

Gene Expression Changes Associated with Dietary
Intervention. Table 2 gives the distributions of gene
expression differences in tissues obtained before and
after dietary intervention. Differences in these tables are
categorized symmetrically above and below zero in units
of log2. In both study arms, the relative difference in
expression of f95% of transcripts ranged between 0.67
and 1.49. In the standard American arm, expression of 20
transcripts decreased by 50% or greater, and 32 tran-
scripts increased by 100% or greater. In the low-fat/low-
glycemic load arm, expression of 9 transcripts decreased
by 50% or greater, and expression of 43 transcripts

increased by 100% of greater. None of the differences in
transcript expression in the standard American arm were
statistically significant, even using a FDR as high as
50%. In contrast, in the low-fat/low-glycemic load arm,
30 (0.53%) of the cDNAs using a criterion of a 15% FDR
and 16 (0.28%) of the cDNAs using a more conservative
criterion of a 5% FDR were statistically different.

Figure 1 shows the list of 23 unique genes that
showed significantly changed expression in the low-
fat/low-glycemic load arm. Several genes are related to
cell migration and tissue remodeling, including MMP7
(also called matrilysin), CXCR4, CXCL2, lumican, and
SPARC-like 1. Others are involved in intracellular signal
transduction, such as the immediate early response genes
2 and 3, the dual specificity phosphatase 1, and the v-ets
oncogene homologue. Expression of insulin-like growth
factor-II receptor transcripts increased, perhaps due to a
positive feedback of the low-glycemic load diet. Genes
that were down-regulated include prostate-specific
membrane antigen and peroxiredoxin 1, which may play
an antioxidant protective role in cells. We confirmed
these microarray results by quantitative reverse tran-
scription-PCR and found a correlation of 0.97.

Discussion

In this small randomized clinical trial, we showed the
feasibility of studying dietary effects on gene expression
using the preprostatectomy model. We collected both
pretreatment biopsies and posttreatment in situ biopsies,

and delivered an effective dietary intervention within the
weeks between diagnostic biopsy and surgery. We also
showed that tissue from a single prostate biopsy core,
weighing f3 to 5 mg, yielded adequate RNA, albeit after
a single round of amplification, for multiple analyses, in-
cluding cDNA microarrays and quantitative reverse tran-
scription-PCR. Lastly, we found that the intraindividual
variability in gene expression in tissues collected at two
time points is sufficiently small to allow the detection of
intervention effects. Much larger sample sizes are needed
to rigorously measure the reliability of transcript expres-
sion from prostate tissue collected at different times, but
these results are encouraging for future research examin-
ing the effects of short-term interventions on prostate
tissue.

The low-fat/low-glycemic load diet, and its associated
weight loss, was associated with multiple gene expres-
sion changes. Many of these changes could conceivably
alter the proliferation, metabolism, and redox potential of
prostate epithelial cells. For example, insulin-like growth
factor-I receptor binds both insulin-like growth factor-I
and -II, and the role of insulin-like growth factor-I recep-
tor in tumorigenesis and proliferation is well established
(8). We emphasize, however, that much larger samples
would be needed to make strong biological inferences
based on gene expression arrays.

The principal

limitation of this study is its small
sample size. We had little power to detect modest
changes in transcript expression. We also sampled only
f6,000 genes of the prostate tissue transcriptome, and
many additional genes that were not evaluated could be

affected to an equal or greater extent. We also have not
determined whether the diet-associated changes in
transcript levels result in corresponding alterations in
the cognate proteins. Lastly, we limited our analyses to
the epithelial compartment, as prostate cancer arises
from the epithelium, however, there are many interac-
tions between the prostate stroma and epithelium
(12-14).

In summary, we conclude that the effect of complex
dietary changes on gene expression can be evaluated
within the preprostatectomy model. These results pro-
vide important information for future studies that aim to
examine the role of diet, obesity, and prostate carcino-
genesis and/or progression.

ABSTRACT We investigated the effect of dietary supple-
mentation with isoﬂavones on pulmonary metastasis of
B16BL6 murine melanoma cells in C57BL/6 mice. Mice were
fed a basal AIN-93G diet or the basal diet supplemented with
the isoﬂavones genistein and daidzein at 113 ␮mol/kg, 225
␮mol/kg, 450 ␮mol/kg, or 900 ␮mol/kg for 2 wk before and
after the intravenous injection of 0.5 x 105 melanoma cells. At
necropsy, the number and size of tumors that formed in the
lungs were determined. The number of mice that had >15
lung tumors was 17 in the control group, and 16, 15, 13, and 10
in the groups fed isoﬂavones at 113 ␮mol/kg, 225 ␮mol/kg,
450 ␮mol/kg and 900 ␮mol/kg, respectively. The latter two
were signiﬁcantly different from the control (P ≤ 0.05). The
median number of tumors in the control group was 67, and
those in the isoﬂavone-supplemented groups were 57, 33, 32,
and 17, respectively. The last was signiﬁcantly different from
the control (P ≤ 0.05). Dietary supplementation with isoﬂa-
vones at 225 ␮mol/kg, 450 ␮mol/kg, and 900 ␮mol/kg also
signiﬁcantly decreased tumor size (median cross-sectional
area and volume) compared to the control values. We con-
clude that dietary supplementation with isoﬂavones reduces
experimental metastasis of melanoma cells in mice. J. Nutr.

Epidemiologic studies suggest that consumption of foods that
are high in soybean-based products is associated with a reduced
risk of breast (Lee et al. 1991), prostate (Severson et al. 1989),
uterine (Goodman et al. 1997), and gastric cancers (Nagai et al.
1982) in humans. Dietary supplementation with soybean protein
isolate (SPI)4 (Hawrylewicz et al. 1991) or soybean chips (Barnes
et al. 1990) reduces mammary carcinogenesis in female rats.
Adding autoclaved raw soybean to the diet of male mice inhibits

bladder (Mokhtar et al. 1988). These protective effects are asso-
ciated with soy isoﬂavones, e.g. genistein and daidzein. Long-term
intraperitoneal administration of genistein and daidzein to young
rats (Constantinou et al. 1996) and subcutaneous injection of
genistein to neonatal rats (Lamartiniere et al. 1995) reduce the
development of mammary carcinoma after exposure of the ani-
mals to carcinogens. Other studies showed that soy-derived prod-
ucts have no effect on tumorigenesis in some animal models
(Reddy et al. 1976).

Soybean is a rich source of dietary isoﬂavones (Murphy 1982).
Isoﬂavones exist in soybean primarily as conjugated glycosides.
Following ingestion, they are hydrolyzed to aglycones by glycosi-
dases produced by intestinal bacteria. The conjugates genistin,
daidzin, and glycitin and their aglycones, genistein, daidzein, and
glycitein constitute 90–95% of the total soy isoﬂavones (Murphy
1982). It appears that the unconjugated aglycones are associated
with many biological properties of isoﬂavones that may be re-
sponsible for their anticancer activities. These include antiestro-
genic activity (Folman and Pope 1966), inhibition of protein
tyrosine kinases (Akiyama et al. 1987), regulation of cell cycle
progression and apoptosis (Kroemer et al. 1995), and antiangio-
genic activity (Fotsis et al. 1993).

Metastasis, the spread of malignant cells from a primary neo-
plasm to distant organs that results in the development of sec-
ondary tumors, is the most devastating aspect of cancer. Ad-
vances in surgical techniques and adjuvant therapies have proven
useful in the treatment of primary tumors. However, metastasis
remains a major cause of poor prognosis and death in cancer
patients. We recently reported that dietary supplementation with
SPI reduces pulmonary metastasis of murine melanoma cells in
mice (Yan et al. 1997). Connolly et al. (1997) reported that
soybean chips inhibit metastasis of human mammary carcinoma
cells in athymic nude mice. These studies suggest that dietary
soybean is useful in preventing the spread of malignant cells.

The objective of the present study was to determine whether
isoﬂavones present in SPI reduce metastasis. To accomplish this,
the effect of dietary supplementation with isoﬂavones genistein
and daidzein on pulmonary metastasis of melanoma cells was
investigated using an intravenous injection model.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Animals and diets. The protocol of the present study was re-
viewed and approved by the Creighton University Animal Care and
Use Committee and complied with the Guide for the Care and Use
of Laboratory Animals (National Research Council 1985). Three-
week-old male C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Charles River
(Wilmington, MA). Mice were housed ﬁve per box, in wire-topped
plastic boxes, in a pathogen-free room on a 12:12-h light-dark cycle.
The temperature in the room was maintained at 25 ⫾ 1°C. Mice were
given free access to the diet and deionized water and weighed weekly.
Five diets were compared: a basal diet and the basal diet supple-
mented with genistein and daidzein (Lancaster, Windham, NH) at
113, 225, 450, or 900 ␮mol/kg, which was equivalent to that provided
in the diet containing 2.5, 5, 10 or 20% SPI, respectively (Yan et al.
1997). The concentration of genistein in isoﬂavone-supplemented
diets was 83.3, 166.7, 333.3, and 666.7 ␮mol/kg, respectively, and the
concentration of daidzein was 29.5, 59.1, 118.1, and 236.2 ␮mol/kg,
respectively. Glycitein was omitted from the supplementation be-
cause it was not commercially available. Dietary formulations were

based on the AIN-93G standard diet (Reeves et al. 1993), except that
soybean oil was replaced with corn oil. Diet components were pur-
chased from ICN (Costa Mesa, CA). All diets were prepared in our
laboratory, and each lot was stored at 4°C for no longer than 3 wk.
Experimental design. Ninety mice were fed the basal diet for 2 d
before being assigned to ﬁve groups of 18 each. They were then fed
the basal diet or one of the isoﬂavone-supplemented diets. B16BL6
murine melanoma cells (Dr. I. J. Fidler, University of Texas, Houston,
TX) were cultured in minimum essential medium with 10% heat-
inactivated fetal bovine serum as described previously (Yan et al.
1997). The melanoma cells were collected from monolayer cultures
by a brief trypsinization (0.05% trypsin and 0.53 mmol/L EDTA).
The viability of the cells was determined with trypan blue, and a
single cell suspension was made in serum-free medium. After 2 wk
consuming the diets, each mouse was injected via the lateral tail vein
with 0.5 x 105 viable cells in 0.2 mL. To avoid possible changes in cell
viability, melanoma cells were injected into mice within 30 min after
their collection. The order that tumor cells were injected into mice
from different dietary groups was randomized. The mice were then fed
the diets for another 2 wk. One wk before tumor cell injection, six
mice from each group were transferred to metabolic cages, and their
food intake was recorded over 7 d. Urine collected from each group
(n ⫽ 6) throughout this week was pooled and analyzed for isoﬂavones
(Xu et al. 1994). Isoﬂavone intake was calculated on the basis of food
intake and the dietary concentration of isoﬂavones.

At the end of the experiment, mice were anesthetized using
ketamine (50 mg/kg body weight) and xylazine (5 mg/kg body
weight) and then killed by cervical dislocation. Their lungs were
excised and ﬁxed in 10% phosphate-buffered formalin. The number
of pulmonary tumors was determined by counting visible black foci by
using a dissecting microscope (Yan et al. 1997). The cross-sectional
area of tumors in randomly selected ﬁelds was measured using a
Quantimet 500 image analysis system (Leica Cambridge, Cambridge,
UK). Tumor volume was calculated using the mean of the longest and
the shortest diameters measured and the assumption that tumors were
spherical (Welch et al. 1983).

Statistical analysis. Fisher’s exact test (Steel and Torrie 1980) was
used to analyze the frequency distribution of the mice that had 1–15
tumors or ⬎15 tumors. Bartlett’s test (Bartlett, 1937) for homogeneity of
variances revealed that standard deviations for the mean values of the
number of tumors, tumor cross-sectional area, and tumor volume differed
signiﬁcantly among the groups (P ⱕ 0.05). Because ANOVA can only
be used to compare the means of populations with homogeneous vari-
ances, the results were analyzed using the Kruskal-Wallis nonparametric
and Dunn’s multiple comparison tests (Kruskal and Wallis 1952). The
data were analyzed using the statistic program Instat 2.01 for Macintosh.
Differences were considered signiﬁcant at P ⱕ 0.05.

intake was recorded. The overall body weight of mice at the
beginning and at the end of the experiment was 14 ⫾ 1 g and
24 ⫾ 1 g, respectively. There was no difference in body weight
among the groups throughout the experiment (data not
shown). The mean food intake of all mice (n ⫽ 30) was 2.6
⫾ 0.6 g/d. There were no differences in food intakes among
the groups (data not shown). The daily isoﬂavone intakes for
each group are shown in Table 1. There were no measurable
isoﬂavones in urine from mice fed the basal diet. The urinary
excretion of isoﬂavones (a sum of genistein, daidzein, and
daidzein metabolites equol and O-desmethylangolensin) was
increased in a dose-dependant manner in mice fed the diet
containing isoﬂavones at 113, 225, 450 or 900 ␮mol/kg (Table
1). One mouse from the control group and one from the 900
␮mol isoﬂavones/kg group were excluded from the experiment
because their growth was signiﬁcantly less than all other mice.
Injection of 0.5 x 105 viable melanoma cells into the lateral
tail vein resulted in lung metastasis in all the mice fed the
control diet (Table 2). Based on the number of lung tumors
per mouse, the mice were placed into one of the two catego-
ries: 1) 1–15 tumors and 2) ⬎15 tumors. In the control group,
all mice had ⬎15 lung tumors (Table 2). By contrast, 89, 83,
72, and 59% of the mice in groups fed the diets containing
isoﬂavones at 113, 225, 450, and 900 ␮mol/kg, respectively,
had ⬎15 tumors. The latter two were signiﬁcantly different
from the control (P ⱕ 0.05). The median number of lung
tumors in the control group was 67. The median number of
lung tumors reduced in the 900 ␮mol/kg isoﬂavone/kg group
compared to the control (P ⱕ 0.05). The mean number of lung
tumors in mice fed the isoﬂavone-supplemented diets de-
creased relative to the control in a dose-dependent manner.
To determine the effect of isoﬂavones on the growth of
metastatic tumors, tumor cross-sectional area and volume were
determined. The median cross-sectional area was 0.55 mm2,
and median volume was 0.21 mm3 in mice fed the basal diet
(Table 3). Dietary supplementation with isoﬂavones decreased
both variables in a dose-dependent manner. The difference in
tumor cross-sectional area and volume between the control
and the groups supplemented with isoﬂavones at 225, 450, or
900 ␮mol/kg was signiﬁcant (P ⱕ 0.01).

isoﬂavones at concentrations equivalent to that provided in
the SPI diets decreased the number of lung tumors and the
tumor cross-sectional area and volume compared to the con-
trols. The dietary isoﬂavone content was positively correlated
with both the urinary isoﬂavone concentration and the mag-
nitude of the inhibitory effect on metastasis. Dietary supple-
mentation with isoﬂavones up to 900 ␮mol/kg had no adverse
effect on the growth of mice during the experimental period.
These results indicate that isoﬂavones effectively reduced pul-
monary metastasis of melanoma cells and also retarded the
growth of those tumors that developed in the lungs.

The observations from this study provide the ﬁrst evidence
that dietary supplementation with isoﬂavones reduces experimen-
tal metastasis. This is supported by the ﬁndings that oral admin-
istration of genistein inhibits lung metastasis of melanoma cells
intravenously injected into mice (Menon et al. 1998). Interest-
ingly, they found that daidzein was ineffective in reducing me-
tastasis. In the present study, the effect of dietary supplementation
with either genistein or daidzein alone was not tested. However,
the concentration of genistein in the experimental diets was
threefold greater than that of daidzein. Thus, the protective effect
of dietary isoﬂavones on experimental metastasis may be largely
attributed to genistein. Whether daidzein is without an effect is
difﬁcult to conclude from the currently available data. In the
study described by Menon et al. (1998), injection of 1 x 106
melanoma cells into mice led to the development of uncountable
massive lung tumors in control and daidzein-treated animals.
Thus, they were unable to determine whether or not daidzein was
effective in reducing metastasis.

At present, the mechanism whereby dietary soybean or isoﬂa-

vones reduces metastasis remains unknown. The experimental
metastasis model employed in the present study measured the
extravasation of melanoma cells from the cardiovascular system
into the interstitum of the lungs. This requires invasion of the
subendothelial basement membrane. Genistein inhibits the in-
vasion of extracellular matrix by BALB/c mammary carcinoma
cells in vitro (Scholar and Toews 1994). This may be due to an
effect of genistein on cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix.
Genistein is a potent inhibitor of protein tyrosine kinases
(Akiyama et al. 1987). Protein tyrosine kinases phosphorylate
tyrosine residues on proteins that participate in signal transduc-
tion events, including integrin-mediated cell adhesion (Hynes
1992). It was shown that genistein inhibits epithelial growth
factor-stimulated integrin expression by human breast cancer
(Narita et al. 1996) and esophageal cancer cells (Sato et al.
1996). Furthermore, genistein inhibits integrin-mediated cell ad-
hesion by lymphoma cells (Weimar et al. 1997) and arterial
smooth muscle cells (Hedin et al. 1997). These observations
suggest that isoﬂavones could reduce metastasis by affecting cell
adhesion. A second possibility is by reducing protease activity.
Genistein inhibits the secretion of urokinase-type plasminogen
activator and metalloproteinase by LM3 murine mammary tumor
cells (Aguirre Ghiso et al. 1998). These effects were also attrib-
uted to the inhibition of protein tyrosine kinases. It should be
noted that in these studies genistein was used as a pharmacolog-
ical tool to study signal transduction events rather than as a
dietary component. The high concentrations employed are be-
yond the level that is achievable in animals consuming a soy-
containing diet. Thus, exposure of cultured cells to isoﬂavones in
vitro is not comparable to providing animals with soybean- or

isoﬂavone-supplemented diets. Therefore, caution should be
taken when data from in vitro experiments are used to explain a
dietary effect of soybean or isoﬂavones in animal studies.

The results of the present study demonstrate that tumor cross-
sectional area and volume of mice fed the isoﬂavone diets were
signiﬁcantly reduced compared to those of mice fed the basal diet.
A decrease in tumor size could be due to prolonged retention of
tumor cells in the circulatory system or an inhibition of malignant
cell proliferation after they take up residence in the lungs. Most
circulating B16 melanoma cells rapidly die following their intra-
venous injection (Fidler 1970). Approximately 1% of the cells
survive for 24 h, and one tenth of them form tumor colonies in
the lungs. Therefore, it is unlikely that retention in the circula-
tion explains the difference in tumor size between the control and
the isoﬂavone-supplemented groups. Rather, it is more likely that
this difference is due to the inhibition of mitosis of malignant
cells in the lungs. Investigations in our laboratory designed to
determine the effect of dietary isoﬂavones on cell proliferation
and angiogenesis during the formation of metastatic tumor will
clarify this possibility.

Comparing results of the present study with our previous
report on dietary SPI and experimental metastasis (Yan et al.
1997), it appears that SPI is more effective in reducing the
number of lung tumors than the isoﬂavone-equivalent diets.
Soybean contains several potential anticancer components
other than isoﬂavones, e. g., protease inhibitors (Kennedy
1993) and saponins (Koratkar and Rao 1997). Although these
agents are largely eliminated during the preparation of the SPI,
trace amounts may exist. The SPI also contains phytate that
has been shown to have a tumor-attenuating action in some
animal models (Shamsuddin et al. 1988). Finally, glycitein,
which was present in the SPI employed in our previous study
(Yan et al. 1997), was not supplemented in the diet in the
present study. Thus, these variations could contribute, at least
in part, to the differences observed in these two studies.

In summary, results of the present study demonstrate that
dietary supplementation with isoﬂavones reduced experimen-
tal metastasis of melanoma cells in mice and also inhibited the
growth of metastatic tumors that developed in the lungs. We
conclude that isoﬂavones are responsible, at least in part, for
the protective effect of dietary soybean on experimental me-
tastasis of melanoma cells in mice.

tenure as a graduate student with the Millers at the University of  Wisconsin 
[I]. In  the  rnid-l960s,  we  discovered that  the  compound N-benzoyloxy-N- 
methyl-4-aminoazobenzene  acted as a model ultimate carcinogen for the ar- 
omatic  aminoazo  dye  carcinogens.  The  reaction  with  methionine  of  this 
compound  in  virro,  and  of  the  presumptive N-hydroxy  metabolite  in  vivo, 
laid the  basis for the  identification  of  the  metabolic activation  of  aromatic 
aminoazo dye  carcinogens  [ l ,   21.  Earlier,  for  reasons  wholly  unrelated  to 
the N-oxidation of  aromatic amines, the  Millers, in  1953, had  suggested “a 
methyl deletion hypothesis”  as a possible mechanism for aminoazo dye car- 
cinogenesis [3]. Other professors who contributed to my  interest in this area 
of  research were: Dr.  Charles Heidelberger through his  studies on  the  syn- 
thesis and  biochemical activity of  5-fluorodeoxyuridine; through  its  inhibi- 
tion of  the enzyme thymidylate synthetase, this compound upsets the labile 
I-carbon  pool  in  cells  [4]. Finally,  the  influence of  Dr.  Carl  A.  Bauman, 
who was then a professor in the Department of  Biochemistry at the Univer- 
sity of  Wisconsin, and  who emphasized the importance of  both  dietary  de- 
ficiency and  antimetabolites as means of obtaining nutritional deficiencies, 
can be  seen  throughout this presentation. 

11.  HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT PRIOR TO 1980 

The major scientific developments showing possible causal links between 
methyl  group  insufficiency  and  hepatocarcinogenesis  in  vivo  are  summa- 
rized 
in  Table  1  [5-15].  The  hepatocarcinogenic  activity  of  choline- 
deficient diets was first reported in  1946 [5]. These early observations were 
extended to  other  species  and  organs but  were eventually called  into ques- 
tion because of  the discovery of  aflatoxin contamination in the peanut  meal 
diets  used  to  achieve a  low  methyl  content  in  the  diet  [16]. From  1955 to 
1983, no  major  studies  appeared  in  the  literature  describing  the  complete 
carcinogenic activity of  choline-deficient diets. Yet,  other studies continued 
to  provide  indications  that  hepatocarcinogenesis was  frequently associated 
with  or enhanced  by  methyl  insufficiency (Table  I).  Also,  the  administra- 
tion  to  rats  of  the  methionine  antimetabolite  ethionine  [17],  of  the  low- 
lipotrope  diet  of  Newberne  [ 181,  and  of  the  amino-acid-defined,  methyl- 
deficient  diet  of  Poirier  (191,  all  provided  evidence  of  hepatic  methyl 
insufficiency either  with  low  levels of  S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) or  of 
macromolecular hypomethylat ion  [ 201.  Finally,  the  results  of  LaPeyre  and 
Becker  [ 151 clearly  showed that  the administration of  the  hepatocarcinogen 
2-acetylaminofluorene,  under  conditions  leading  to  liver tumor  formation, 
also led to  the hypomethylation of  hepatic  DNA.

Findings 

Choline-deficient diets, con- 
taining peanut meal or soy- 
bean  meal, caused  liver 
cancer in  rats and  mice. 
These diets were  later- shown 
to  be  contaminated with  the 
liver carcinogen aflatoxin. 

The methionine antagonist 

ethionine caused liver cancer 
in  rats. 

Chronic administration of  liver 

carcinogens or of  methyl- 
deficient diets to rats led to 
similar biochemical changes 
in  the  liver, including de- 
creased hepatic SAM. 
A  low-lipotrope (methyl- 

deficient) diet enhanced the 
activities of  several hepato- 
carcinogens in  rats. 

A  choline-devoid diet exerted 

both  cocarcinogenic and 
tumor-promoting activities 
toward the  livers of  rats. 

Feeding a carcinogenic regime 
of  2-acetylaminofluorene to 
rats led  to DNA  hypomethy- 
lation in  the liver. 

111.  HEPATOCARCINOGENESIS  AND 

BIOCHEMICAL CHANGES 

Beginning  in  1983,  three  publications  clearly  showed  that  carcinogen- 
free  methyl-deficient diets caused  liver cancer in  rats  [21-231.  In  the  first 
study, Mikol  et  al.  [21], using  an  amino acid-defined diet,  showed  that  a 

POI R I ER 

diet  lacking methionine and choline produced  liver cancer by  itself  and  en- 
hanced  liver tumor formation  in  rats given a single initiating dose of  dieth- 
ylnitrosame.  Ghoshal  and  Farber  [22]  and  Yokoyama  et  al.  [23],  using 
alcohol-extracted,  peanut-meal-containing  diets,  obtained  similar  tumor 
yields in the livers of  male rats. Thus, the hepatocarcinogenicity of  choline 
or methyl deprivation  seemed to be  clearly established.  In fact, most of  the 
biochemical  changes  commonly  associated  with  liver  tumor  formation  by 
chemical carcinogens were also seen during hepatocarcinogenesis by  methyl 
deprivation.  These  included: the  accumulation of  lipid  peroxides  [24, 251, 
increased levels  of  ornithine  and  SAM decarboxylases  [ 191,  increased thy- 
midine  incorporation into liver DNA  [26], decreased levels of  histidase and 
urocanase (271, and  finally, increased formation of  altered hepatic foci [28, 
291.  The  latter  findings  were  particularly  interesting  from  a  potentially 
mechanistic standpoint.  In  the absence of  diethylnitrosamine initiation,  the 
chronic feeding of  the amino-acid-defined diet, lacking both methionine and 
choline,  led  to  the  formation  of  altered  hepatic  foci  which  continuously 
increased  in  volume  but  not  in  number; this observation  is  consistent with 
the  hypothesis  that  methyl  deprivation  is  not  a  continuously  initiating 
stress,  but  rather  is a highly effective promoter of  preexisting,  initiated  he- 
patocytes  [28]. The  strong  liver-tumor-promoting activity  of  choline  defi- 
ciency  had  been  previously  described  [ 301. 

While  the  effects  of  dietary  methyl  deficiency  on  hepatocarcinogenesis 
were  being  explored,  other  investigations  were  conducted  on  the  interac- 
tions  between  hepatocarcinogens  and  liver tumor  promoters and  labile me- 
thyl  groups.  In  particular,  the  effects  of  such  interactions  in  liver  tumor 
formation,  on  the  hepatic  levels  of  SAM,  and  on  the  DNA  content  of  5- 
methyldeoxycytidine (5-MC) were determined.  The results are summarized 
in  Table 2 [8, 9,  12,  15,  18. 21,  31-39].  The hepatocarcinogenic activities 
of  three  of  the  four carcinogens  examined-ethionine, 
diethylnitrosamine, 
and  2-acetylaminofluorene-were 
shown  to  be  enhanced  by  dietary  lipo- 
trope deficiency or to be  inhibited by  high dietary  levels of  methionine and/ 
or  choline  (Table 2). In  one  study,  lipotrope deficiency  was  not  shown  to 
exert any  significant effect upon  the hepatocarcinogenic activity of  dimeth- 
ylnitrosamine [ 121. Further, the liver-tumor-promoting activity of  phenobar- 
bital  and  of  DDT was  suppressed in  rodents by  the  feeding of  high  dietary 
levels of  methionine and choline (Table 2)  1311. A11  six of  the hepatocarci- 
nogenic  stressors whose  activity  was  inhibited  by  methyl donors  were  also 
shown  to  decrease  the  hepatic  content  of  SAM  or  the  ratio  of  SAM  to S- 
adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) in  the  livers of  chronically fed  rats (Table 2). 
SAH is both  a  product of  and  a  strong inhibitor of  SAM-dependent methy- 
lations  [40]. Similarly, four such  carcinogenic regimes led  to  decreased  5- 
MC  in  hepatic  DNA  under  chronic  feeding conditions  (Table  2)  (15,  35-

IV.  ALTERATIONS IN ONCOGENES DURING 

HEPATOCARCINOGENESIS BY  METHYL  DEPRIVATION 

The early association between decreased hepatic SAM and DNA hypom- 
ethylation led  to the proposal that  increased oncogene expression caused by 
such  hypomethylat ion  was  a  causative  factor  in  hepatocarcinogenesis  by 
methyl  deficiency.  This  hypothesis  was  supported  by  a  number  of  related 
observations.  Specific gene hypomethylation has been commonly associated 
with  increased expression [41]. Two  DNA  hypomethylating agents,  the  an- 
timetabolites  ethionine  and  5-azacytidine,  altered  differentiation  of  Friend 
erythroleukemia cells in vitro [42]. 5-Azacytidine transformed cells in  vitro 
[43] and  enhanced  liver tumor formation  in  vivo [44, 451.  SAM-dependent 
DNA  methylation  inhibited  the  transforming  activity  of  the  Moloney 
sarcoma  virus  in  virro  [46].  Generalized  DNA  hypomethylation  was 

I90 

POIRIER 

commonly seen in the tumors and transformed cells compared to the tissues 
and  cells of  origin  [47].  Finally,  the  H-rus  oncogene  of  colon  carcinomas 
was hypomethylated compared to the adjacent normal tissue  1481. Our own 
studies showed that the  18-month feeding of  any of  several methyl-deficient 
amino-acid-defined diets led to hypomethylation of  the c-H-rus and c-K-rus 
oncogenes in  both  neoplastic  and  preneoplastic  liver 149). More  recent  re- 
sults showed that  1- to 32-week feeding of the carcinogenic methyl-deficient 
amino-acid-defined  diet  resulted  in  the  hypomethylation  of  CCGG  se- 
quences  in  the  c-H-rus,  the  c-K-rus,  and  the  clfos  protooncogenes  at  all 
times  investigated  [50].  In  fact,  the  methylation  changes  in  the  c-H-rus 
gene  increased  in  intensity  throughout  the  experimental  period  until  at  32 
weeks they  resembled those  seen  in  the  livers of  rats  fed  the same diet  for 
18  months.  Slot-blot  analyses of  the  same livers showed increased expres- 
sion  of  the  same  three  protoncogenes correlating  with  decreased  methyla- 
tion  [5 I].  These  results  demonstrate  early  selective  hypomethylation  of 
some  CCGG  sites,  accompanied  by  increased  gene  expression,  in  rats 
undergoing hepatocarcinogenesis  by  dietary  methyl deprivation.  All  of  the 
oncogene  changes  described  above  were 
independent  of  carcinogen 
administrat ion. 

Several  other  laboratories  have  investigated  the  correlations  between 
DNA  methylation  and  oncogene  expression  during  hepatocarcinogenesis. 
Wainfan,  Christman,  and  their  collaborators  [52,  531  showed  that  the 
chronic  administration  to  rats  of  an  amino-acid-defined,  methyl-deficient 
diet  for  1-4  weeks led  to the following: ( I )   DNA hypomethylation as mea- 
sured by  SAM-dependent, methyl acceptor activity; (2) increased DNA  me- 
thylase activity;  (3) increased expression and  decreased  methylation of  the 
protooncogenes c-myc, c-fos,  and c-Hi-rus; and  (4) no change in the expres- 
sion  of  methylation of  the  c-K-ras  oncogene.  All  of  the  changes observed 
by  this group could be reversed by  placing the animals on the corresponding 
methyl-adequate  diet  for  1-2  weeks  [52,  531. The  group  of  Locker  and 
Lombardi  has  examined  the  hepatocarcinogenenic  effects  of  a  choline- 
devoid diet on the amplification and methylation of  the c-myc protoncogene 
1541. They found that:  (1) c-myc was amplified  2-  to  70-fold  in  all  tumors 
produced  by  the diet; (2) relative c-myc transcript  levels increased with  the 
stages of neoplasia; (3) hypomethylation of  c-myc was observed in the livers 
of  rats  fed the choline-devoid diet for  12 or more months; and (4) the c-myc 
gene  in  tumors  showed  varying  degrees  both  of  hypermethylation  and  of 
specific  site hypomethylation.  In  related  studies,  Feo and  his  collaborators 
[55]  investigated  SAMEAH  ratios  as  well  as  oncogene  methylation  and 
expression in the persistent nodules produced  in the livers of  rats  treated by 
a  modified  Soh-Farber  regime  [56]. They  found  the  following changes  in 
the  persistent nodules:  (1) decreased  SAM/SAH ratios  to  40%  of  controls;

(2) decreased  5-MC content  to  50% of  control  values;  (3) 4-  to  6-fold  in- 
creases in the c-K-rus, c-H-rus, and c-myc RNA transcripts; and (4) hypom- 
ethylation of  all three protoncogenes investigated [ 5 5 ] .  Chronic treatment of 
such animals with SAM led  to partial, but marked, reversal of all molecular 
changes  noted  1571.  In  an  extension  of  these  studies,  the  same  group 
showed  that  the  chronic  administration  of  SAM  itself  markedly  inhibited 
the  tumor-promoting activity of  phenobarbital  in  rats  previously treated  by 
the Soh-Farber  regimen  (Table 3) [58]. 

While  the  changes  described  above essentially  describe  correlations  be- 
tween  oncogene  hypomethylation  and  activation,  other  results  recently 
showed  a  high  frequency of  mutations  in  the p53  gene  in  the  DNA  from 
tumors  caused  by  choline  deprivation  [59].  In  preliminary  studies,  DNA 
from tumors derived from the livers of  rats fed amino-acid-defined, methyl- 
deficient diets transformed NIH-3T3 cells [49]. However, in this study, only 
4  of  28  tumor  DNA  samples  examined  exhibited  transfecting  activity;  all 
showed  amplified  H-ras  in  the  transfectants.  However,  all  of  the  positive 
DNA  samples  came  from  diethylnitrosamine-initiated rats;  none  of  the 
DNA  samples  from  the  uninitiated  rats  fed  the  severely  methyl-deficient 
diets  transformed  NIH-3T3  cells  [49].  In  more  recent  studies,  DNA  sam- 
ples  from  liver tumors developing in  rats  fed  the  methionine- and choline- 
deficient  diet,  as  well  as  from  cells  obtained  from 
these  tumors, 
transformed NIH-3T3 cells; the cells displayed c-myc amplification  [60]. 

In  summary, the  molecular biological studies conducted to date on  hepa- 
tocarcinogenesis by  dietary  methyl deprivation  indicate that  while hypome- 
thylation  and  increased  expression  of  c-H-rus,  c-K-rus,  and  c-fos  have 
all  been  observed,  their role  in carcinogenesis,  in the absence of  an  initiat- 
ing  agent,  remains  to  be  established.  On  the  other  hand,  the  presence  of 
activated  myc  and  mutated  p53  genes  in  the  tumors  of  animals  fed  the 

192 

POIRIER 

methyl-deficient  diets  without  any  further  carcinogen  treatment  suggests 
that such changes are likely to play a causative role in carcinogenesis in this 
system. 

V.  ALTERNATE MECHANISMS 

While  the  prospective  mechanism  of  carcinogenesis  by  methyl  insuffi- 
ciency  emphasized  in  this  presentation  is  enhanced  oncogene  expression 
caused by  gene hypomethylation, other mechanisms may  be  responsible for 
such biological effects. Chief among the hypotheses proposed are mutations 
produced  by  varying  mechanisms such  as oxidative  damage  [61. 621,  ab- 
normal  DNA  methylation  [63, 641,  and  altered deoxynucleotide pool  sizes 
1651. Consistent with  a hypothesis that oxidative damage to DNA results in 
the mutations leading to cancer are the observations that the chronic admin- 
istration of choline-deficient diets leads to: ( I )   single-strand breaks 1611; (2) 
high  hepatic  levels of  peroxidized lipids  [61, 661;  (3) the  inhibition of  al- 
tered hepatic foci induced by  choline deprivation through feeding of  antiox- 
idants [67]; and (4) the formation of  8-hydroxyguanine in hepatic DNA  [62, 
681. On the other hand,  a recent elegant study of  Shen et al.  [64] has shown 
that  the  transfection  of  the  Hpa  11  methylase  gene  into  bacteria  lacking 
uracil-DNA  glycosylase  results  in  a  high  frequency  of  C  to  U  transition 
mutations  in  the  absence of  the  substrate  SAM.  Such  mutations  were  re- 
duced  to  background  levels  by  high  levels of  SAM  or  SAH  [64]. These 
results are consistent with  previous findings that a high  proportion of  inac- 
tivating mutations in the p53  gene in colorectal cancer occur at methylation 
sites on  DNA  [69] and  that the cytosine complex with  methylase is chemi- 
cally  susceptible  to  deamination  unless  it  is  rapidly  methylated  with  SAM 
[70]. Finally, the control exerted by  SAM on  folate distribution  is expected 
to alter the deoxynucleotide pool  sizes in target tissues [71]. This is clearly 
the case in the spleens of  rats fed diets deficient in  folate,  methionine,  and 
choline (Table 4) [72]. Significant decreases in the dGTP,  dATP, and dTMP 
were  noted  in  the  spleens  of  rats  fed  a  folate-deficient  or  a  methionine/ 
choline-deficient diet. 

Extensions to other organs of  such studies indicate that physiological me- 
thyl  insufficiency  may  contribute  to  carcinogenesis  to  biological  systems 
other  than  the  livers  of  choline-deficient  rats.  For  example,  a  number  of 
observations  have  linked  the  abnormal  differentiation  of  pancreatic  acinar 
cells with  an  inadequate supply of  methyl donors. Thus,  pancreatic  degen- 
eration  is a common feature of  ethionine toxicity  in  rodents  [8]. Pancreatic

acinar cells from  hamster embryos differentiate normally only  in  the  pres- 
ence of  such methyl group sources as methionine, choline, and  SAM  [73]. 
Further, hepatization  of  pancreatic  acinar cells  occurs  in  hamsters treated 
sequentially with ethionine and a choline-devoid diet 1741. Finally, such hep- 
atization of  pancreatic acinar cells is seen in  rats chronically fed an amino- 
acid-defined methyl-deficient diet  1751.  Recent results from  the  studies by 
Lyn-Cook at NCTR  176-791  have tended to  increase the number of  associ- 
ations found between methyl insufficiency, DNA  hypomethylation, and sus- 
ceptibility  to  transformation  by  pancreatic  acinar  cells  (Table  5).  For 
example, pancreatic acinar cells in  vitro  acquire hepatocyte-like properties 
following treatment with  the  DNA-hypomethylating agent  azacytidine  (Ta- 
ble  5). Also,  pancreatic acinar cells derived from rats  undergoing  hepato- 
carcinogenesis by  methyl  deprivation  seem  to  transform  more  readily  in

The evidence currently available indicates that in humans, folate depriva- 
tion  may  contribute  strongly  to  a  methyl  insufficiency  in  vivo.  Our  own 
interests in this area occurred with the discovery that HIV-infected patients 
had  low  levels of  both  SAM  and  NS-methyltetrahydrofolate in  their  cere-

brospinal  fluid  (80, 811.  Normally,  low  SAM  arising  from  dietary  methyl 
insufficiency  is  accompanied  by  an  increased  proportion  of  tissue  NS- 
methyltetrahydrofolate [71]. Thus, the prospect  arose that  the  low  SAM  in 
these  patients  was  a  consequence and  not  a  cause  of  the  one-carbon  defi- 
ciency  noted  in  these patients  1821. Other  studies have  increased the  num- 
ber  of  associations  between  folate  deficiency,  physiological  methyl  group 
insufficiency in  vivo,  and  cancer  formation  in  humans  (Table 6) [83-941. 
At  present,  however, we  are unaware  of  any  clear evidence  indicating  that 
in  humans folate deficiency results in  methyl  insufficiency in  any organ. 

In  rats,  however,  the  situation  is  different.  Within  the  last  few  years, 
Walzem and Clifford (951 developed an  amino-acid-defined, folate-deficient 
diet permitting the long-term survival of  rats. The chronic administration of 
these diets to rats has resulted in: ( I )  significant general hypomethylation of

Alcohol  induces  both  hepatotoxicity and  folate  deficiency  in  humans  and 
experimental  animals;  its  hepatotoxic  effects  can  be  inhibited  by  SAM 
[ 85-90]. 

Clinical  studies  have  shown  an  association  between  folate  deficiency  and 
dysplasia  in  the  cervical,  bronchial,  and  colonic  epithelium,  as  well  as 
with  colon tumor formation  (91-941.

SAH, chiefly by  large  increases in  SAH  1971; and (3) enhanced formation 
of  dysplasia and  of  neoplastic  lesions  in  the  colon  of  dimethylhydrazine- 
treated rats (981. Thus, it appears reasonable to propose that the physiolog- 
ical  insufficiency of  methyl donors that occurs in  rats as a consequence of 
either choline or methionine deficiency may  also be  seen  in  humans, espe- 
cially under conditions of  toxic stress.

Nutrient Ineractions and Toxicity

Implanted Tumor Growth Is Suppressed and Survival Is Prolonged in
Sixty Percent of Food-Restricted Mice

ABSTRACT To examine the effect of food restriction on immune functions in the tumor-bearing state, mice were
divided into a control group (fed 5.0 g diet/d; 71 kJ/d) and a 60% food-restricted group (fed 3.0 g diet/d; 43 kJ/d)
at 8-wk of age, and 4 wk later, L1210 tumor cells were inoculated intradermally. In the food-restricted mice, tumor
growth was signiﬁcantly suppressed, and mean survival time after the tumor inoculation was prolonged (P ⬍ 0.05).
The plasma concentrations of two antitumor cytokines, interferon-␥ (IFN-␥) and tumor necrosis factor-␣ (TNF-␣),
were greater in the food-restricted group before tumor inoculation (P ⬍ 0.05). Furthermore, the food-restricted mice
had signiﬁcantly higher plasma levels of IFN-␥ and TNF-␣ after tumor inoculation, although the treatment
signiﬁcantly increased these cytokine levels in both groups. Splenic natural killer cell cytotoxicity was also higher
in the tumor-bearing food-restricted mice than in controls (P ⬍ 0.05). Food-restricted mice have strong antitumor
immunity, and as a result, tumor growth is suppressed and survival time is prolonged in these mice. J. Nutr. 130:

Food restriction (FR)2 prolongs the mean and maximal life
spans of rats, mice and other species (Cheney et al. 1980,
Comfort 1963, Ross 1961, Weindruch and Walford 1988). In
addition, FR of rodents results in a reduced incidence and
delayed onset of tumors and other age-associated diseases
(Weindruch 1989, Yu et al. 1982).

FR results in the activation of cellular immunity, altered
subsets of T cells (Gartner et al. 1992), enhanced responses of
T cells to mitogens and interleukin-2 (Hishinuma et al. 1990),
and altered production of antibodies and interleukin-2 (Spear-
Hartley and Sherman 1994). It has been proposed that host
immune surveillance mechanisms effectively suppress the in-
cidence of tumors in FR animals (Konno et al. 1991). FR also
has been shown to greatly reduce white blood cell (WBC)
number, particularly the lymphocyte count (Kubo et al. 1984).
Although mechanisms by which FR reduces WBC number
have not yet been clariﬁed, it has been reported that the
incidence of leukemia is lowered in FR mice due to the
reduction of leukocytes (Volk et al. 1994). Moreover, strong
immune responses and a high resistance to developing spon-
taneous tumors in FR mice are thought to be closely related to

tumor cells intradermally into 60% FR mice, and studied host
immune functions after the tumor inoculation.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Animals. Male BDF1 mice (5-wk-old) were obtained from Clea
(Osaka, Japan). These mice had free access to water and to a diet
reported by Konno et al. (1991), which was composed of 20% casein,
64% potato starch, 5% soybean oil, 5% cellulose powder, 4% salt
mixture and 2% vitamin mixture.3 These mice were kept at con-
trolled temperature (23 ⫾ 2°C), humidity (60 ⫾ 10%) and lighting
(12-h light and 12-h dark cycle), and housed individually. When
8-wk-old, mice were randomly divided into control and 60% FR
groups. Mice in the control group were fed 5.0 g of the diet daily (71
kJ/d), whereas 60% FR mice received 3.0 g (43 kJ/d). All experimen-
tal procedures involving laboratory animals were approved by the
Animal Care and Use Committee of Osaka Prefecture University.

Inoculation of tumor cells. L1210 leukemia cells (America Type
Culture Collection, CCL219), obtained from Riken Cell Bank
(Tsukuba, Japan), were maintained in Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle’s
medium, supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and
10 mmol/L HEPES. At 12 wk of age (4 wk after the initiation of FR),

TNF-␣ data, values were logarithmically transformed to improve
normality and to compensate for unequal variance, and were analyzed
by two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s test. All data are shown as
means ⫾ SD, and statistical signiﬁcance is deﬁned as P ⬍ 0.05.

RESULTS

When FR was started in BDF1 mice at 8 wk of age, body
weight was signiﬁcantly lowered within 1 wk and at 12 wk of
age, the weight in the FR group was about 75% (P ⬍ 0.05) of
that in the control (Fig. 1). The FR-induced body weight
change observed in this experiment is consistent with previous
reports (Hishinuma et al. 1988, Konno et al. 1991). Tumors
appeared at the site of the inoculation in both the FR and
control groups by 2 wk after the treatment (at 12 wk), and the
tumors progressively grew thereafter. However, the rate of the
tumor growth was signiﬁcantly slower in the FR group, and 3.5
wk (25 d) after the inoculation, tumor weight in the FR mice
was ⬍ 30% (P ⬍ 0.05) of that in controls (Fig. 2A). A
signiﬁcant difference was also seen in survival curves between
the FR and control groups (Fig. 2B). Mean survival time after
tumor inoculation in the control group was 30.7 d, and all
control mice died by 35 d. In contrast, in the FR group, the
mean survival time was prolonged to 38.5 d (P ⬍ 0.05), and
the ﬁnal mouse survived until 54 d.

Although red blood cell number was not different between

trol and 60% food-restricted (FR) mice. Male mice at 8 wk of age were
divided into control (5 g of a diet/d; 71 kJ/d) and 60% FR (3 g of a diet/d;
43 kJ/d) groups, and 4 wk later these mice were inoculated with L1210
tumor cells by intradermal injection. Values are means ⫾ SD, n ⫽ 7. *: P

mice in both the FR and control groups were inoculated with L1210
by intradermal injection of ⬃10 6 cells. For determination of tumor
growth, 2, 3 and 3.5 wk after the inoculation these mice (seven mice
in each group at each time point) were anesthetized with ethyl ether,
and tumors in these mice were isolated and weighed.

Determination of leukocyte, lymphocyte, neutrophil and mono-
cyte counts. Mice (ﬁve mice in each group) were anesthetized with
ethyl ether, and blood was collected by cardiac puncture. Blood
samples (10% in an EDTA solution) were incubated on ice until
measured with an automatic blood corpuscle count apparatus (Sys-
mex K-1000; Toua Iyou Electric, Kobe, Japan). For investigation of
differential counts, blood smears were prepared on microscope slides,
and the slides were air-dried and stained by a modiﬁed Giemsa
method (Seki et al. 1981). Leukocytes (over 200 cells) on the slides
were examined and the percentages of lymphocytes, neutrophils and
monocytes were determined.

Determination of plasma cytokine levels. Blood was collected by
cardiac puncture, and plasma interferon-␥ (IFN-␥) and tumor necro-
sis factor-␣ (TNF-␣) levels were determined by enzyme-linked im-
munosorbent assay methods using commercial kits (QuantikineTM M
Mouse IFN-␥ Immunoassay and QuantikineTM M Mouse TNF-␣
Immunoassay; R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN).

Cytotoxicity assay for natural killer (NK) cells. Spleen cells
were prepared according to a published method (Weindruch et al.
1983). NK-sensitive YAC-1 cells were used as target cells for the
assay of NK cell cytotoxicity. Spleen and target cells were co-cultured
in a 96-well microtiter plate at the effector to target ratio of 100:1 for
4 h at 37°C in 5% CO2, and NK cell cytotoxicity was measured by a
lactate dehydrogenase-release method using a commercial kit (Cyto-
Tox 96® Non-Radioactive Cytotoxicity Assay; Promega, Madison,
WI) according to manufacturer’s instructions.

Statistical analysis. Statistical analyses were performed with
GB-Stat 5.4 (Dynamic Microsystems, Sliver Spring, MD). Body
weights were compared between the FR and control groups during the
experiment by two-way ANOVA for repeated measures, and post-hoc
analyses were done by Tukey’s method. Mean survival time after the
tumor inoculation, and lymphocyte, neutrophil and monocyte counts
were compared between the two groups by one-way ANOVA fol-
lowed by Scheffe´ post-hoc test. Effects of FR on tumor growth, WBC
number and NK cell activity were evaluated by two-way ANOVA,
and multiple comparisons were done by Tukey’s test. For IFN-␥ and

the control and FR groups (data not shown), WBC number
was 45% lower (P ⬍ 0.05) in the FR mice (Fig. 3), as reported
previously (Kubo et al. 1984). Tumor cell inoculation did not
affect WBC number in either group and the number was
signiﬁcantly lower in the FR mice even 3.5 wk after inocula-
tion. Lymphocytes and neutrophils were reduced in the FR
group, compared to the controls, in the tumor-bearing state
(P ⬍ 0.05) (Table 1).

Before tumor inoculation, plasma IFN-␥ concentration in
the FR mice was higher than that in the control (P ⬍ 0.05).
When L1210 tumor cells were implanted, a signiﬁcant eleva-
tion in the plasma IFN-␥level occurred which peaked at 3 wk
in both groups (Fig. 4A). However, the FR mice had a higher
plasma IFN-␥concentration even after the tumor inoculation,
and at the peak, the level in the FR mice was about 3.5-fold
greater than that in the controls (P ⬍ 0.05). The plasma
TNF-␣ concentration also was signiﬁcantly augmented by FR
in the nontumor-bearing mice (Fig. 4B). Furthermore, 3.5 wk
after tumor inoculation, plasma TNF-␣ concentration in the
FR mice was also higher (about 2.5-fold greater) than that in
the control (P ⬍ 0.05), although the tumor inoculation sig-
niﬁcantly increased the TNF-␣ level even in the control
group.

FIGURE 4 Changes in plasma interferon-␥ (IFN-␥) (A) and tumor
necrosis factor-␣ (TNF-␣) (B) levels after tumor inoculation in food-
restricted (FR) mice. FR and control mice at 12-wk-old were inoculated
with L1210 tumor cells, and changes in plasma IFN-␥and TNF-␣levels
were examined. Values are means ⫾ SD, n ⫽ 5. *: P ⬍ 0.05 compared
with the control mice at the corresponding time point. #: P ⬍ 0.05
compared with wk 0.

Before inoculation, there was no signiﬁcant difference be-
tween the FR and control groups in NK cell cytotoxicity (Fig.
5). However, tumor inoculation signiﬁcantly augmented NK
cell cytotoxicity in the FR mice, but not in the control mice.
Thus, at 3.5 wk after inoculation, NK cell cytotoxicity was
greater in FR mice than in control mice (P ⬍ 0.05).

DISCUSSION

It has been shown that FR prevents the occurrence of
late-life spontaneous tumor development and reduces the in-
cidence of tumors induced by radiation or chemical carcino-
gens (Higami et al. 1995, Kolaja et al. 1996, Yoshida et al.
1997). In addition, it has been proposed that these effects of
FR on the onset of tumors are due to the activation of host
immune surveillance mechanisms (Konno et al. 1991, Wein-
druch et al. 1986). Our present data obtained in mice inocu-
lated with L1210 tumor cells show that the growth of the
implanted tumor is signiﬁcantly suppressed in 60% FR mice,
and survival time is longer in these mice (Fig. 2).

In the tumor-bearing state, it has been shown that tumor-
primed CD4⫹ T cells are activated to produce IFN-␥
(Yamamoto et al. 1995). IFN-␥ possesses an antiproliferative
activity against many transformed cell lines in addition to its
antiviral and immunoregulatory functions (Abe et al. 1998,
Giovarelli et al. 1986, Stark et al. 1998). TNF-␣, which was

particularly lymphocytes (Kubo et al. 1984, Weindruch and
Walford 1988). In our study, tumor inoculation did not sig-
niﬁcantly change total WBC number in either the 60% FR or
control groups, and lymphocyte number in the FR mice was
signiﬁcantly lower even in the tumor-bearing state. It has been
shown that FR induces apoptosis, and immune organs, such as
spleen and thymus, are comparatively more sensitive to apop-
tosis than other organs (Keusch et al. 1983). Thus, the low
lymphocyte count in FR mice may be closely related to apop-
tosis in spleen and thymus. Energy restriction has been sug-
gested to enhance T cell function in aged mice by maintaining
apoptosis at levels found in younger mice, thereby removing
non- or poorly functioning T cells (Spaulding et al. 1997). It
is thus thought that immunologically less effective T cells are
eliminated in the FR mice, presumably by apoptosis, even in
the tumor-bearing state. Since CD4⫹ T cells participate in the
production of IFN-␥ in tumor-bearing mice (Yamamoto et al.
1995), the elimination of nonfunctional T cells may be one of
the important factors in improving antitumor immunity in the
FR mice.

originally deﬁned by its antitumor activity in vitro and in vivo
(Carswell et al. 1975, Feinman et al. 1987, Sugarman et al.
1985), has been reported to be mainly produced by macro-
phages after stimulation with IFN-␥ (Collart et al. 1986,
Celada and Maki 1991, Han et al. 1990). L1210 leukemia
cells, which were used in this experiment, are insensitive to
TNF-␣ cytolysis in vitro (Leu et al. 1991), whereas the IFN-␥
receptor is expressed in this cell line (Wietzerbin et al. 1986).
It has also been reported that macrophage-mediated cytotox-
icity of L1210 cells is augmented by IFN-␥ in synergy with
interleukin-2 or lipopolysaccharide in vitro, and TNF-␣ par-
ticipates in the cytotoxic mechanism to produce nitric oxide
by an autocrine mechanism in macrophages (Jiang et al.
1992). Our data (Fig. 4) indicate that in the normal state,
IFN-␥ and TNF-␣ levels are signiﬁcantly greater in the 60%
FR group compared to the control. Furthermore, the FR mice
have greater abilities to produce IFN-␥ and TNF-␣ even after
inoculation of L1210 tumor cells, although this treatment
increases cytokine production in both FR and control groups.
We contend the activated production of IFN-␥and TNF-␣in
FR mice is related closely to the effective suppression of tumor
growth. However, detailed mechanisms by which IFN-␥ and
TNF-␣ production are stimulated by FR are unclear. It has
been reported that the CD4⫹ T cell subpopulation is aug-
mented in FR mice in both the normal and tumor-bearing
states (Gartner et al. 1992, Volk et al. 1994).

NK cells are important antitumor effectors both in vitro
and in vivo (Herberman 1985, Ortaldo and Herberman 1984),
and high NK cell cytotoxicity has been associated with reduc-
tions in tumor development (Reisenfeld et al. 1980). In the
60% FR group, but not in the control group, NK cell cytotox-
icity was signiﬁcantly augmented by the tumor inoculation
(Fig. 5), suggesting that NK cells improve antitumor immunity
in the FR mice. Since activated NK cells can produce IFN-␥
and TNF-␣ (Perussia 1991), it is thought that NK cells par-
ticipate in the active production of IFN-␥ and TNF-␣ in the
tumor-bearing FR mice.

It has been reported that FR reduces leukocyte number

AMPK  is  an  evolutionarily  conserved  fuel-sensing  enzyme  that  is  activated  in 
shortage of energy and suppressed in its surfeit. AMPK activation stimulates fatty 
acid  oxidation,  enhances  insulin  sensitivity,  alleviates  hyperglycemia  and 
hyperlipidemia,  and  inhibits  proinflammatory  changes.  Thus,  AMPK  is  a  well-
received therapeutic target for metabolic syndrome and Type 2 diabetes. Recent 
studies indicate that AMPK plays a role in linking metabolic syndrome and cancer. 
AMPK  is  an  essential  mediator  of  the  tumor  suppressor  LKB1  and  could  be 
suppressed  in  cancer  cells  containing  loss-of-function  mutations  of  LKB1  or 
containing active mutations of B-Raf, or in cancers associated with metabolic 
syndrome. The activation of AMPK reprograms cellular metabolism and enforces 
metabolic checkpoints by acting on mTORC1, p53, fatty acid synthase and other 
molecules  for  regulating  cell  growth  and  metabolism.  In  keeping  with  in  vitro 
studies, recent epidemiological studies indicate that the incidence of cancer is 
reduced  in  Type  2  diabetes  treated  with  metformin,  an  AMPK  activator.  Thus, 
AMPK is emerging as an interesting metabolic tumor suppressor and a promising 
target for cancer prevention and therapy.

AMP-activated  protein  kinase  acts  as  a  fuel 
gauge that is activated under stresses such as 
hypoxia,  ischemia,  glucose  deprivation  and 
exercise  [1].  Activation  of  AMPK  stimulates 
fatty acid oxidation to generate more ATP to 
cope with acute energy demand and inhibits 
anabolic processes that consume ATP [1]. As a 
result, energy is preserved for acute cellular pro-
grams. In addition, AMPK activation enhances 
insulin sensitivity, inhibits hepatic glucose pro-
duction, stimulates glucose uptake in muscle, 
inhibits fatty acid synthesis and esterification, 
and diminishes proinflammatory changes  [2]. 
Thus, AMPK is a well-accepted target for the 
treatment of metabolic syndrome and Type 2 
diabetes (for extensive reviews, refer to  [1–3]). 
During the last 5 years, since our first review [3], 
great attention has been drawn to link AMPK 
and cancer, and substantial progress has been 
made. AMPK, by regulating a variety of down-
stream targets, such as mTORC1, p53 and fatty 
acid synthase (FASN), and associated metabolic 
processes, controls intra cellular energy levels 
in order to maintain the cell growth rate at an 
appropriate level. Likewise, AMPK activation 
under  metabolic  stress  or  by  pharmacologi-
cal activators can regulate various processes, 
including cell cycle checkpoint, cell polarity, 
senescence, autophagy and apoptosis  [4–7]. In 
this article, we aim to summarize recent evi-
dence  in  support  of  the  notion  that  AMPK 

serves  as  a  metabolic  tumor  suppressor  and 
discuss the implications of AMPK in cancer 
prevention and treatment. 

Activation of AMPK
AMP-activated protein kinase belongs to a family 
of serine/threonine protein kinases and is highly 
conserved from yeast to human. It consists of 
three subunits: a catalytic subunit (a) and two 
regulatory  subunits  (b  and  g)  [8,9].  In  mam-
mals, each subunit of AMPK contains two to 
three isoforms (a1, a2; b1, b2; g1, g2 and g3). 
When cells confront metabolic stress, the intra-
cellular AMP level or the ratio of AMP to ATP 
is increased. AMP then binds to the g-subunit, 
yielding two outcomes; first, it serves as allo-
steric activator and second, it protects AMPK 
against phosphatases to dephosphorylate threo-
nine 172 in the activation loop of the catalytic 
a-subunit [9–11]. Another critical step for AMPK 
activation is the phosphorylation of threonine 
172. Previous studies suggest that AMP binding 
enables the phosphorylation of threonine 172 by 
an upstream kinase [12,13]. However, this notion 
is challenged by recent in vitro studies showing 
that phosphorylation of AMPK by purified LKB1 
complex is independent of AMP [11,14]. A possible 
explanation of this discrepancy is that the AMPK 
preparations used in previous studies may have 
been contaminated with phosphatases, of which 
the activity toward AMPK is inhibited by AMP.

Summary

The relation between cancer and metabolic disorders was recognized several
decades ago, but the underlying mechanisms involved in cancer development
and progression remain obscure. In the last years, many groups have been
studying systemic adipose tissue markers in cancer patients. However, few con-
sistent results were obtained. On the other hand, several studies revealed
many aspects of adipose tissue physiology in obesity. Nowadays,
is
recognized that excessive lipid uptake in adipocytes leads to hypertrophy and
consequently to metabolic dysregulation, hypoxia,
impaired
adipocytokine expression and angiogenesis, insulin resistance and macrophage
recruitment. In obese patients, tumours commonly colocalize with excessive
adipose tissue accumulation, and most of the features of hypertrophic adipose
tissue are observed in cancer patients, namely breast and colon. This
review aimed to summarize pathological adipose tissue alterations that may
contribute to cancer aetiology and development. Copyright © 2013 John Wiley

Epidemiology

The link between metabolic disorders and cancer was
proposed more than 80 years ago and is still under intense
investigation. The prevalence of obesity is rapidly increasing
worldwide; 71% of US men and 62% of US women are
overweight or obese. In Europe, metabolic syndrome affects
individuals, and this will
25–31% of
further increase
because of
the increasing prevalence of obesity in
children and young adults [1–4]. Obesity increases the
risk of multiple health conditions, including diabetes,
hypertension and cancer. However, BMI does not
distinguish adipose tissue from other tissues, nor does
it inform fat distribution [1–4].

Epidemiological studies have shown that high BMI
values were strongly associated with increased incidence
of several types of cancer and also premalignant lesions
[5,6]. However, colorectal cancer was shown to be more
strongly associated with waist circumference and visceral
adipose tissue [1,7]. This link is stronger in men because
they have more visceral fat. However, when considering
waist circumference (marker of visceral obesity), differences
between sexes disappear [1,7–11]. Women and men with
waist circumferences >99 and 101 cm, respectively, have
50% higher colon cancer risk [1,7,8,10].
In addition,
infantile obesity was also demonstrated to increase colon
cancer risk in adult life [9,12]. On the other hand, gastric
bypass surgery was shown to decrease the risk of cancer
mortality [13]. In postmenopausal women, obesity has
been associated with higher incidence of breast cancer,
reduced likelihood of survival and increased likelihood of
recurrence [9].

Adipose tissue in obesity and cancer

Adipose tissue contains several cell
types including
adipocytes, preadipocytes, ﬁbroblasts, endothelial cells
and resident macrophages, which produce a broad range
of cytokines, adipocytokines and growth factors, such as
adiponectin, leptin, resistin, visfatin, VEGF, PAI-1, MCP-1
or TNF-a (Figures 1 and 2) [3,9,11,14,15]. Recent studies
correlated pathological
alterations with adipocyte
hypertrophy, rather than hyperplasia. During adipocyte
hypertrophy, activation of NF-kB leads to inactivation of
PPARg and insulin receptor. This conduces to decreased
lipid and glucose uptake, adiponectin secretion and adipo-
genesis. In addition, increased expression of inﬂammatory,
chemoattractant, growth and matrix remodelling factors is
also observed (Figure 2) [1,9,11,15–17]. Consequently, FFAs
accumulate in other tissues such as liver and muscle, causing
hepatic and peripheral lipotoxicity and insulin resistance [18,19].

During this process, adipose tissue localization appears
to be critical. As already discussed, visceral adiposity
has been considered a major risk factor for metabolic
syndrome and apparently for cancer.

It has been suggested that adipose tissue may support
tumour cell growth. Adipose tissue-derived factors have
been shown to inﬂuence the behaviour of tumour cells.
Mature adipocytes promote proliferation of tumour cells
in tridimensional cultures, and adipocyte-conditioned
medium also promotes tumour cell invasion and prolifera-
tion [20]. Further, Carter and Church recently demonstrated
that conditioned medium of adipocytes isolated from breast
adipose tissue increased cell motility of both normal and
malignant breast epithelial cells [21]. In mice, simultaneous
(but not separate) injection of tumoral cells with adipose
tissue results in tumour formation and metastasis [14]. In
addition, Hirose and co-workers showed that db/db mice,
which have hyperleptinaemia and hyperinsulinaemia, have
an increased susceptibility to colon premalignant lesions
induced by azoxymethane [22]. Authors from the same
laboratory also showed that these effects were prevented
by antioxidants [23,24]. Despite the fact that the model
used on these studies has hyperleptinaemia, Aparicio and
colleagues showed that leptin may reduce the development
of premalignant lesions in the colon [25]. Thus, besides
increasing tumour progression, obesity and diabetes
apparently contribute to increased formation of premalignant
lesions, but the role of the different players is still unknown.
The formation of hypoxic regions has a major effect on
cell metabolism. Thus,
it is expected that metabolic
intermediates resulting from hypertrophy may somehow
regulate angiogenesis. In the last decades, many studies
have shown that inﬂammation is the link between them.
Cells respond to metabolic alterations by mechanisms
involved in innate immunity, activating inﬂammatory
pathways [18,19]. Besides resulting in insulin resistance,
this also contributes to angiogenesis. Inﬂammation and
angiogenesis
share common pathways, as most of
cytokines and adipocytokines have pro-angiogenic effects,
contributing to tissue irrigation and also to cancer
progression [9,18–20]. Moreover, both adipose tissue
and tumours recruit macrophages, whereas the tumour
also recruits adipose stroma cells, showing a strong
relation between adipose tissue and the tumour [8]. The
integration of such mechanisms in adipose tissue and
tumour physiology will be discussed in the following
sections.

Metabolic dysregulation in adipose
tissue and tumour cells

Dysregulation of lipid metabolism
Adipocyte hypertrophy results in the accumulation of
secondary metabolites (such as long-chain acetyl-CoA or
diacylglycerol) involved in the activation of several stress and
inﬂammatory pathways, consequently leading to insulin
resistance and triglyceride hydrolysis (Figure 2) [19,26–28].
Like adipocytes, macrophages have the ability to change

cytoplasmatic accumulation of FFAs and hypoxia, leading to activation of inﬂammatory and stress pathways and inactivation of
insulin signalling. These mechanisms involve increased TNF-a, MCP-1, VEGF, resistin and leptin and decreased adiponectin
expression, contributing to increased macrophage inﬁltration. Tissue macrophages regulate matrix degradation and collagen
deposition. These mechanisms constitute a hypoxia feedback mechanism to increase angiogenesis and inhibit continuous adipocyte
growth, decreasing hypoxia. However, most of angiogenic and chemoattractant mediators and macrophages also regulate tumour
growth

lipids,
their phenotype and store large amounts of
leading to foam cell formation, which are common in
hypertrophic adipose tissue. These macrophages have
an increased inﬂammatory potential, creating a positive
inﬂammatory loop in adipose tissue [9]. Importantly,
PPARg controls lipid storage in both adipocytes and
macrophages but is inactivated by such inﬂammatory
pathways (Figure 2). On the other hand, the amount
of lipids that the adipocyte has to process and store
depends on the ability of peripheral organs to oxidize
fatty acids, which is mainly controlled by AMPK
[1,9,11,29,30].

PPARg and diet regulation. PPARg is a nuclear receptor and
transcription factor activated mostly by lipids, increasing
the expression of several proteins involved in fatty acid
uptake and storage [11,15,30] (Figure 2). Furthermore,
PPARg directly inhibits nuclear translocation of the NF-k
B, thereby inhibiting the expression of cytokines and other
inﬂammatory mediators [11,15,30,31]. Although most tu-
mour cells express PPARg, it has not been yet established
whether its expression is related to tumour differentiation
and metastasis [1]. PPARg ligands,
including TZDs, are
known to inhibit proliferation of cancer cells, increasing nu-
clear levels of tumour suppressor BRCA1 [1,14]. Positive
effects of PPARg activators on cancer progression may also
be due to decreased ectopic accumulation of substrates in cy-
toplasm, namely glucose and lipids, and to decreased in-
ﬂammation and insulin resistance.

As PPARg is a diet-regulated transcription factor, the
involvement of dietary lipids in adipocyte homeostasis
appears to be obvious. In fact, saturated FFAs can activate
NF-kB through TLR4 signalling, whereas PUFAs bind to
and activate PPARg [30,31]. Despite PUFAs such as o-3
and o-6 activating PPARg, they were described to have
distinct effects on cancer development and growth. o-3
PUFAs inhibit cancer growth and cell motility, increasing
PPARg activation in cell lines and enhancing cancer cell
apoptosis in mice [11]. On the other hand, o-6 PUFAs
were positively correlated with tumour development in
breast and were shown to promote tumour cell motility
[11]. Thus, diet regulation of PPARg is important for
tumour development, but the underlying mechanisms
remain unknown.

AMP-activated kinase. AMPK, a major energy regulator
activated by adiponectin, increases glycolysis and fatty
acid oxidation and inhibits gluconeogenesis and fatty acid
and cholesterol synthesis [29,32]. However, obese and
type 2 diabetic individuals usually have decreased
adiponectin levels, AMPK activity and fatty acid oxidation.
AMPK inhibits SREBP1c and activates PPARa. This results
in increased expression of several enzymes involved in
fatty acid oxidation and decreased expression of ACC
and FAS, key enzymes of
fatty acid synthesis [33].
Furthermore, AMPK directly inactivates ACC, thereby
decreasing malonyl-CoA formation (inhibitor of CPT-
1-mediated mitochondrial
from
acetyl-CoA, resulting in higher rates of mitochondrial

acid uptake)

fatty

fatty acid uptake and oxidation [9,29,32,34]. AMPK
activates PI3K and Akt and induces GLUT-4 transloca-
tion to the cell membrane, thereby increasing glucose
uptake [29,32,35]. Moreover, Abbot and colleagues recently
showed that AMPK is necessary for Akt-mediated fatty acid
uptake in the muscle [35].

Several authors suggested AMPK-induced inhibition of
lipid synthesis as a good strategy to decrease lipid
availability for cell membranes during tumour growth [34].
AMPK also activates p53,
inhibiting the cell cycle [34].
Furthermore, AMPK inhibits aromatase expression in
adipose tissue, contributing to decreased oestrogen
levels and preventing the development of oestrogen-
dependent tumours [34]. Thus, AMPK activation has been
proposed as an effective strategy for cancer therapy, and
positive results have been observed after metformin
treatment, a known activator of AMPK [34].

Hypoxia
A reliable feature of hypertrophic adipose tissue is hypoxia
(resulting from decreased blood supply), which is also
conducive to the activation of inﬂammatory pathways,
macrophage recruitment and dysregulation of adipocyto-
kine secretion [9,36,37]. However, hypoxia is also
common in tumours. HIF-1 is the key factor in cell
response to hypoxia,
stimulating inﬂammation and
angiogenesis
(discussed in the following sections)
[38,39]. These mechanisms are likely to support tumour
growth [9]. Furthermore, HIF-1 exerts signiﬁcant effects
on cellular metabolism. Cancer cells have a signiﬁcant
shift away from oxidative phosphorylation in mitochon-
dria towards glycolysis, a state involved in the ‘Warburg
effect’ [40–42]. Warburg ﬁrstly described that cancer cells
have increased glucose uptake and ATP formation (see
comprehensive revisions about this issue in [92–94]).
As tumour is mostly hypoxic, HIF-1 increases the transcrip-
tion of the cell-surface glucose transporter GLUT-1 and
contributes to the expression of several glycolytic enzymes,
including lactate dehydrogenase, and inhibits acetyl-CoA
formation, which would be used in the oxidative phosphor-
ylation [40,42]. In addition, because of the high rate of
glucose consumption, malignant cells accumulate high
amounts of pyruvate, which can be used to fuel the
tricarboxylic acid cycle for biosynthetic processes, and even
earlier by-products of glycolysis will enter the pentose
phosphate pathway for the maintenance of DNA, RNA
and fatty acids. Recently, our colleagues showed that
methylglyoxal, a metabolite of glycolysis, increases HIF-1
degradation in hypoxic conditions [43]. However, cancer
cells develop resistance mechanisms
such as elevated
expression of glyoxalases, which degrade methylglyoxal [44].
Glyoxalase expression is inhibited in most cells in
hyperglycaemic conditions, possibly accounting for the
different ability of normal and tumoral cells to adapt to
hypoxic conditions [44,45]. The contribution of adipose
tissue hypoxia to tumour development is unknown, but
tumours are usually surrounded by adipose tissue; thus,
it is likely that such an environment may contribute to
a better tumour adaptation [46].

Adipose Tissue Dysfunction and Cancer

Cytokines and adipocytokines –
metabolism, inﬂammation and
angiogenesis

Activation of inﬂammatory pathways as a consequence of
accumulation of intracellular metabolites and formation
of hypoxic regions leads to altered cytokine and adipocy-
tokine secretion. This conduces to inhibition of continued
lipids and glucose uptake and stimulates angiogenesis.
However, most of the products released by the adipose
tissue under such conditions may also affect tumour
physiology [30,47–49]. In this section, we review the
alterations of these factors as a result of adipose tissue
dysfunction and how they inﬂuence tumour formation
and development.

Adiponectin
Adiponectin circulates in three distinct molecular forms,
trimeric, hexameric and high-molecular-weight
forms
(several hexameric forms), and it is mainly produced by
the adipose tissue [50–52]. Adiponectin levels, especially
high-molecular-weight forms, were found to be lower in
obesity,
insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes and
inversely correlated with abdominal perimeter and fat
mass, more than BMI [1,14,15,53]. Adiponectin expression
is decreased by TNF-a and IL-6 (NF-kB activators) and
increased by PPARg
(Figure 2). However,
adiponectin also inhibits TNF-a and IL-6 expression in macro-
phages,
inactivating the inﬂammatory cascade [14,20].
Adiponectin increases fatty acid oxidation and insulin
sensitivity
it
activates AMPK and PPARa [1,20].

Adiponectin decreases proliferation of several cell types
including adipocytes, endothelial cells and cancer cells [20].
Beyond inhibition of tumour cell growth and survival,
adiponectin inhibits angiogenesis through decreased
VEGF and Bcl-2 expression (anti-apoptotic) and increased
p53, Bax and caspase activation (pro-apoptotic), leading
to endothelial cell apoptosis [1,20]. Likewise, adiponectin
was shown to reduce TNF-a-induced effects on cell
proliferation and migration [53]. In fact, several studies
showed hypoadiponectinaemia as a determinant for larger
tumours with increased angiogenesis [1,14,20]. Thus,
adiponectin may
only
inﬂammation but also angiogenesis, and these effects
may be crucial for regulation of neovascularization in
pathological conditions such as obesity, type 2 diabetes
and also cancer. However, it is not known yet whether
hypoadiponectinaemia is a risk factor for cancer or
hypoadiponectinemia and cancer development are
parallel events of metabolic dysregulation.

Leptin
Leptin is currently at the centre of the obesity–cancer link,
as it is produced in proportion to fat mass (almost
exclusively in adipocytes) and potently induces cell
(normal
and
motility [14,20,48,54–57]. Leptin activates JAK/STAT
and MAPK pathways and also the SOCS-1 and SOCS-3,

inhibiting insulin and its own signalling cascade
[1,15,56,57]. This mechanism is chronically activated in
obesity and is one of the major causes of leptin and insulin
resistance [1,14,58].

independently of BMI

Clinical studies in Norwegian and Japanese populations
showed leptin correlation with increased risk of breast
and colon cancers,
[45,59].
Furthermore, leptin was also positively correlated with
increased metastization [1,20,51,60]. In most of the patients,
tumour cells express the Ob-Rb. Insulin, IGF-1 and oestradiol
were observed to activate its expression [61]. In addition,
leptin also promotes aromatase expression in adipose
tissue and ER on tumour cells [14,62]. However, leptin
is mitogenic for both ER-positive and ER-negative
tumour cell lines, inhibiting apoptosis and increasing cell
proliferation [14,20,48,53,62].

From this, we may conclude that leptin promotes
tumour cell proliferation both directly and indirectly
(through an increase of oestrogen levels and insulin
resistance). However, leptin effects on cancer development
are still controversial. Several studies reported elevated
leptin levels in cancer patients, but these studies compared
cancer patients with healthy controls without separation of
the obesity component
in the experimental design.
Furthermore, existing studies did not reveal a pattern of
leptin variation between premenopause and postmeno-
pause. Zucker rats, which have a mutation in Ob-Rb and
exhibit hyperleptinaemia, have increased formation of
benign neoplasies but minimal
formation of malign
tumours [53]. In fact, it is possible that leptin does not
act as a tumour inducer but more as a supporter of already
formed tumours.

Resistin
Resistin has been pointed as a major link between innate
immunity and glucose metabolism as it was shown to
inhibit hepatic, muscle and adipose insulin signalling,
consequently leading to inﬂammation and insulin
resistance. Its circulating levels are usually increased in
models of obesity. Antibody neutralization, overexpres-
sion of nonfunctional resistin or gene knockout in mice
results in improved glucose metabolism and insulin
sensitivity [15,18,63–65]. However, extrapolating possible
effects of human resistin from murine experiments has
several caveats. Murine resistin is produced in adipocytes,
whereas human resistin is mainly produced in macrophages
(Figure 2) [15,18,65]. Furthermore, human and murine
resistin genes are located in different chromosomes, and
studies searching for a human gene more similar to murine
resistin have been unsuccessful [15].

Recently, Qatanani and colleagues developed mice with
suppressed expression of endogenous resistin and transgenic
expression of human resistin in macrophages [18].
After consuming a high-calorie diet, these rats had
increased lipolysis in adipose tissue. They also developed
increased triglyceride and diacylglycerol levels and insulin
resistance in muscle, due to PKC-induced serine phosphor-
ylation of insulin receptor and IRS-1 (Figure 2) [18].

through increased lipid uptake, resulting from activation
of scavenger receptors (SR-1 and CD36) involved in
recruiting lipoproteins and FATP. Conversely, resistin
increases proteasomal degradation of ABCA1 involved
in cholesterol efﬂux [15,66].

Human resistin stimulates proliferation of vessel muscle
cells and VECs [15,65,67]. In endothelial and choriocarci-
noma cells, resistin also increases the expression of VEGF
and its receptors while also elevating MMP, possibly
through NF-kB activation [65,68]. Thus,
resistin
overexpression is a physiological response to adipose
tissue hypertrophy and hypoxia, but it may also contribute
to tumour angiogenesis. Despite the data about this issue
still being scarce, several studies have implicated resistin
in the aetiology of obesity-related cancers, namely breast
and colon [50,51,64,69–72]. Resistin may provide unique
insights to the link between obesity, inﬂammation, insulin
resistance and cancer risk in humans.

Visfatin
Visfatin is highly expressed in visceral fat of rodents and
humans, whose plasma circulating levels are positively
correlated with the size of visceral fat deposits [73].
Several studies reported increased visfatin levels in
various pathological conditions, such as obesity, inﬂamma-
tion, diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome and cardiovas-
cular diseases [74–78].

phosphoribosyltransferase,

Visfatin was originally isolated from lymphocytes as
an enzyme
nicotinamide
that
synthesizes nicotinamide mononucleotide from
nicotinamide [79]. The following studies reported an
insulin-mimetic effect through binding to a different
region of
insulin receptor, activating IRS-1 tyrosine
phosphorylation [73,80–86]. However, the original study
reporting these effects was later retracted [73], and the
mechanisms of visfatin action, beyond NAD+ synthesis,
remain obscure. Nevertheless, visfatin expression was found
to be stimulated by HIF-1 and the JNK/NF-kB pathway,
promoting angiogenesis
through MMP expression in
endothelial cells and VEGF expression in tumour cells
[79,87–89]. Visfatin is also expressed in tumoral cells, and
its circulating levels were found to be increased in breast
and colon cancer patients [82,87]. Furthermore, visfatin
was observed to increase cell proliferation and invasion
during breast cancer progression [87]. Visfatin inhibitors
have been clinically evaluated as anticancer agents, but
new epidemiological and cellular studies are needed to
understand the mechanisms of visfatin action on cancer [90].

Tumour necrosis factor alpha
TNF-a was the ﬁrst recognized adipose-derived cytokine
to be involved in metabolism regulation. In this ﬁeld,
Hotamisligil’s laboratory has been particularly active,
producing data and reviews about TNF-a’s role on
adipocyte metabolism (see reviews in [31,47]). TNF-a is
produced mainly in macrophages, but also in adipocytes
and preadipocytes, after excessive lipid accumulation,
activating several serine kinases (JNK and IKK). This
results in NF-kB activation and inhibition of
insulin

signalling (Figure 2) [1,14,15,20]. NF-kB stimulates the
production of other cytokines and inhibits PPARg activity
and subsequent expression of adiponectin, CD36 and
LPL. Thus, TNF-a inhibits preadipocyte differentiation,
lipid and glucose uptake and fatty acid esteriﬁcation and
increases lipolysis [1,53]. These mechanisms aim to
inhibit continued adipocyte growth but may also be
important for cancer progression because they lead to
metabolism dysregulation (as focused on in Section 2.1)
and hyperinsulinaemia, when chronically active. In fact,
a link between TNF-a levels and breast and colon cancer
has been suggested [14]. Beyond its metabolic effects,
TNF-a seems to contribute to tissue alterations necessary
for tumour growth and metastasis, namely cell proliferation.
TNF-a stimulates aromatase expression in adipose tissue,
increasing oestrogen-mediated tumour cell proliferation
[20,91–93]. Furthermore, TNF-a stimulates VEC prolifera-
tion and migration in rat cornea [53]. Clinical trials with
several TNF-a antagonists and antibodies have shown
promising effects in reducing tumour development and
metastasis [94].

Monocyte chemoattractant protein 1
MCP-1 is a protein that recruits and activates circulating
monocytes to the adipose tissue [95–98]. Initially, MCP-1
was considered an activator of antitumour cytotoxic
functions of macrophages. However, identiﬁcation of two
types of TAMs and the revelation of MCP-1 angiogenic
potential altered the perspective of MCP-1 physiology on
cancer (Figure 2) [95,99,100]. In the last years, several
studies have found elevated MCP-1 levels, especially in
advanced stages [96,99]. However, it is not established
whether MCP-1 circulating levels are a systemic marker
of poor prognosis or not. Some discrepancies may be
caused by different studied populations, experimental
designs, degree of metastasis, tumour phase and time of
sample collection [99].

In adipose tissue, MCP-1 expression correlates with
increased macrophage inﬁltration and angiogenesis
[19,28,36]. In epithelial cells, MCP-1 expression is low,
but it is acquired along with the transformation [98,99].
MCP-1 is also secreted by tumour stroma cells, such as
macrophages and ﬁbroblasts, acting through paracrine
and autocrine pathways [95,99]. Recently, Niu and
colleagues showed that MCP-1 promoted in vitro tube
formation in HUVEC. In addition, Hong and colleagues
showed that these effects were dependent on VEGF
activation [101,102]. Furthermore, MCP-1 was observed
to increase angiopoietin (Ang)-2 levels and MMP
expression on monocytes, T cells and tumour cells, which
also contributes to angiogenesis [96,99,103]. On tumour
cells, MCP-1 does not induce proliferation but increases
their migration ability. MCP-1 was also suggested to be
involved in epithelial-to-mesenchymal
transformation,
an event essential for cell transformation [99]. Higher
levels of MCP-1 are correlated with increased macrophage
inﬁltration, MSC migration, vascularization,
tumour
progression and lymphatic invasion [95,96,99,104]. An
anti-MCP-1 antibody decreased MSC migration to tumour,

angiogenesis and lung metastasis, increasing the survival
ratio [99,104]. Thus, as
in adipose tissue, MCP-1
and recruited macrophages change the tumour microenvi-
ronment to support cell proliferation and migration and
angiogenesis.

Angiogenic mechanisms – growth
factors and matrix remodelling

Adipose tissue profoundly depends on angiogenesis as it is
subjected to constant expansion/regression. Capillary
growth is a complex process involving matrix degradation,
endothelial cell migration and tube formation and depends
on the anastomosis of two growing tubes. This process is
regulated by several factors, namely ﬁbroblast growth
factors, hepatic growth factor (HGF), VEGF, Angs (Ang-1
and Ang-2), epithelial growth factors, adipocytokines,
insulin/IGF-1, oestrogens and MMP, some of them already
discussed in this review [53].

Several adipose-derived factors have paracrine effects,
acting directly on neighbouring endothelial cells to
promote angiogenesis. Most of these factors are produced
in response to adipocyte hypertrophy and consequent
metabolic dysregulation and regional hypoxia. As we
already discussed, the unifying point is inﬂammation,
which results from both of these conditions. Inﬂammatory
mediators directly induce angiogenesis and increase the
expression of several angiogenic factors. Furthermore,
most of these factors also recruit macrophages, which also
produce their own set of angiogenic factors (VEGF, TNF-a,
ﬁbroblast growth factors, MMPS and resistin), further
contributing to angiogenesis (Figure 2) [53,105,106].

Tumour angiogenesis is important for its growth, but
vessels are usually dysfunctional with abnormal ramiﬁca-
tions, probably due to the imbalanced expression of growth
factors in hypertrophic adipose tissue and in the tumour.
Furthermore, these vessels are usually very permeable and
allow the passage of ﬂuids, proteins and tumour cells,
favouring metastization.

Growth factors
VEGF is the only angiogenic factor speciﬁc for VECs.
Obese individuals commonly have increased VEGF levels
[see review at 53]. VEGF is produced by adipose tissue
cells, namely adipocytes, preadipocytes and macro-
phages, stimulating VEC proliferation and migration, ex-
pression of proteolytic enzymes and tube formation and
inhibiting apoptosis (Figure 2) [53]. VEGF expression is
stimulated by regional hypoxia (through HIF-1 stabiliza-
tion), factors from the EGF family and insulin (via PI3K
and Akt), to compensate for insulin-induced nutrient
deposition and tissue expansion [53,107,108]. Recently,
our group described the VEGF/Ang-2 ratio to determine
vascular integrity. The imbalance of this ratio caused
endothelial cell apoptosis and loss of vessel
integrity
[109]. However, increased tumour VEGF levels are also
associated with poor prognosis [53]. Consequently,

several antitumour drugs based on its neutralization
were developed. Antibody neutralization of VEGF recep-
tor 2 also decreased both angiogenesis and preadipocyte
differentiation [53].

Other growth factors such as bFGF and HGF have also
been studied as possible players in tumour growth. bFGF
and HGF are produced in adipocytes and stimulate VEC
proliferation and MMP expression [20,53,110]. For bFGF,
no correlations with BMI were found in previous studies,
probably because it acts mainly through paracrine
mechanisms [53]. HGF is known to act on its receptor
Met (product of c-met gene) and to promote proliferation,
motility and invasion of hepatic tumour parenchymal cells
[53,110,111]. However, HFG is produced proportionally
to BMI and correlates with bigger tumours and increased
lymphatic invasion [20,53]. Furthermore, HGF promotes
cell invasion independently of VEGF and also increases
its expression [20,53,110,111]. HGF is highly produced
in tumour or peritumoral adipose tissue, decreasing after
tumour excision [20].

Proteolytic matrix degradation – plasminogen system
Besides MMPs, the plasminogen system also regulates
extracellular matrix degradation, to allow vessel growth.
This system is formed by the plasminogen, cleavage
enzymes (tissue plasminogen activator and uPA and
serine proteases), PAI-1 and membrane uPA receptor
(uPAR), regulating ﬁbrinolysis and matrix proteolysis
[see review at 11]. Plasminogen is cleaved to plasmin by
its tissue plasminogen activator in arterial walls and
by uPA in the extracellular matrix,
increasing matrix
degradation [11]. Furthermore, uPA binding to uPAR
leads to integrin binding and cytoskeleton arrangement
favouring cell migration [11]. Thus, uPA and uPAR are
markers of invasiveness and poor prognosis. uPA inhibition
results in decreased tumour invasiveness. On the other hand,
PAI-1 binds to and inhibits uPA. This complex binds to uPAR
and is internalized [11]. Despite uPA inhibition effects, circu-
lating PAI-1 levels are a marker of poor prognosis in breast
cancer, and it was suggested as a potential target in cancer
therapy [11]. Although the reasons for elevated PAI-1 levels
are not known, it is known to be highly produced in dysfunc-
tional adipose tissue, and it has been suggested to promote
cell growth and migration, angiogenesis and migration of
smooth muscle cells [11,112].

Insulin – mitogenesis and IGF-1
regulation

Insulin resistance is common in patients with elevated
BMI and is a hallmark of type 2 diabetes, being usually
associated with visceral obesity and inﬂammation in
adipose tissue [7,14,15]. Also, the effects of insulin analogues
in type 1 diabetic patients have been discussed in the last
years. Long-action insulin analogues, such as glargine, are
widely used because they do not cause hypoglycaemia.
However, attempting to efﬁciently control postprandial
glycaemia with these medications, authors have found that

patients are episodically hyperinsulinaemic [113]. Hyperin-
sulinaemia has been pointed as a major risk factor for breast,
colon and prostate cancer [7,14,15,114–116]. Also, elevated
C-peptide levels were found to be associated with a threefold
increase in colon cancer risk [1,12].

that

Insulin has been shown to increase cell survival and
growth (through the IRS-1–PI3K–Akt pathway), supporting
[113]. Furthermore, Chen and
tumour development
colleagues
recently
reported
insulin-mediated
activation of this pathway causes chemotherapy resistance,
originating new questions about the role of insulin on
cancer [117,118]. However, the impact of insulin mitogenic
effects on obesity-related cancer through this pathway is
controversial, as IRS-1 is partially inhibited on insulin
resistance. Thus,
the discovery of a noncanonical
pathway for insulin-stimulated mitogenesis is a major
hallmark on metabolism-related cancer. Most growth
factors activate the canonical Ras–Raf–MAPK pathway.
Besides increasing IGF-1 and VEGF circulating levels
and aromatase expression in adipose tissue, insulin was
also observed to increase isoprenylated (active) Ras
levels in the cell membrane, thereby increasing cell
response to other growth factors (see review in [113]).
The IGF family components include IGF-1 and 2,
membrane receptors (IGFR1 and 2), IGFBPs (IGFBP1 to
IGFBP6) and IGFBP proteases [14]. Like insulin, IGF-1
regulates cell survival, growth and differentiation and
inhibits apoptosis [9]. On the other hand,
IGFBPs
decrease IGF bioavailability,
inhibiting its effects and
promoting apoptosis [14]. However, IGFBP1 and IGFBP2
expressions are downregulated by insulin,
increasing
free/active IGF-1 levels [3,8]. Insulin-resistant individuals
commonly have higher IGF-1 circulating levels [3,8,9].

On epithelial cells, IGF-1–IGFR binding leads to receptor
dimerization and to PI3K and Ras–Raf–MAPK activation
[14]. Furthermore, oestrogens increase IGF-1 and IGFR1
expressions, acting synergistically in favour of
tumour
growth [14]. As insulin, IGF-1 also activates VEGF expres-
sion and thus indirectly acts on endothelial cells [1].
Elevated IGF-1 and decreased IGFBP-1 levels were
previously correlated with increased cancer risk, tumour
invasion and poor prognosis [1,14]. Also, breast tumours
with elevated IGFR-1 levels, both premenopause and
postmenopause, usually are more invasive [14]. In mice,
IGF-1 overexpression resulted in increased tumour growth,
whereas disruption of IGFR1 prevented it [8,9,14].

The role of macrophages on tissue
remodelling – implications in adipose
tissue and tumour

In obese individuals, adipose tissue commonly has
extensive macrophage inﬁltration, recruited by TNF-a
and particularly by MCP-1 (Figure 2). On the other hand,
macrophage-secreted products such as TNF-a or resistin
induce insulin resistance and promote angiogenesis
(Figure 2). Macrophage coculture results in impaired

adipocytokine expression and increased production of
pro-inﬂammatory cytokines in adipocytes [8].

Tumour environment is formed by several cell types,
namely ﬁbroblasts, cells from hematopoietic lineage,
endothelial cells and adipocytes. These cells strongly
interact, creating a microenvironment that is conducive
to tumour growth [119,120]. Adipose-related tumours
have large amounts of macrophages (up to 50% of the
tumour cells) [100,105,119,120]. More than 80% of
cancers have elevated macrophage inﬁltration, correlating
with increased vessel density, tumour progression and poor
prognosis [53,99,100,104,105,119]. Genetic macrophage
elimination reduces tumour progression and metastasis in
mice [8].

A tumour commonly has two distinct populations of
macrophages: M1 macrophages are pro-inﬂammatory
and secrete antitumour cytokines and M2 macrophages
are immunosuppressive and produce a broad range of
angiogenic and growth factors, including MCP-1, MMPs,
TGF-b, VEGF and PDGF, promoting proliferation and
migration of tumour cells and VEC, matrix degradation
and ultimately angiogenesis
[8,49,104–106,119–121].
The reason why this macrophage population acquires this
behaviour is still unknown. However, this is also observed
in macrophages recruited to the hypertrophic adipose
tissue, which are involved in tissue remodelling and
angiogenesis [36].

Macrophages

intensely populate the ﬁbrotic ring
surrounding the tumour and regions of basal membrane
rupture. They seem to regulate collagen synthesis in
ﬁbroblasts and also support blood vessel formation close
to collagen ﬁbres [119]. This leads to increased collagen
deposition, anchored to blood vessels, allowing faster
tumour cell migration to the circulation (Figure 1)
[100,119]. These features are not found in macrophage-
deﬁcient mice [8,119]. Importantly, adipose tissue from
obese animal models was recently described to develop
extensive ﬁbrotic regions, which may support growth of
adipose-associated tumours
from
tumour periphery also have high aromatase expression,
which is increased by macrophage-released cytokines
such as TNF-a [14,20].

[121]. Fibroblasts

The close relation between tumour cells and macrophages
in the invasive front involves CSF-1 and EGF signalling
[100,120]. Tumour
cells express CSF-1 to increase
macrophage activity, and macrophages express EGF to
stimulate migration of tumour cells. Accordingly, macro-
phages express CSF-1R whereas tumour cells express
EGFR1 [119]. Mice with CSF-1 depletion have decreased
VEGF and MMP expression and metastization and more
benign phenotypes. CSF-1 expression restores phenotype,
and CSF-1 overexpression in normal mice leads to more
TAM and increased tumour growth and metastization
[100,119]. Moreover, macrophage depletion results in 40%
decreased angiogenesis
even in advanced tumours,
suggesting that macrophages are involved in the formation
of new blood vessels and in the remodelling of those already
existing, as observed during adipose tissue expansion
[36,100,119]. Macrophage-derived VEGF, beyond VEC

stimulation, also recruits other macrophages to support
tumour growth [100,119]. Present data show that TAM
and adipose tissue macrophages share important similari-
ties, promoting tissue remodelling and angiogenesis. In
addition, adipose tissue macrophages may possibly support
tumour development.

Decreased Growth of Human Prostate LNCaP Tumors in SCID

Mice Fed a Low-Fat, Soy Protein Diet With Isoflavones

William J. Aronson, Christopher N. Tymchuk, Robert M. Elashoff,
William H. McBride, Colin McLean, Hejing Wang, and David Heber

Abstract: Epidemiological studies suggest that high intake
of dietary fat is a risk factor for the development of clinical
prostate cancer. Soy protein has also been proposed to play
a role in the prevention of prostate cancer, and one of the
isoflavones in soy protein, genistein, inhibits the growth of
human prostate cancer cell lines in vitro. This study was de-
signed to evaluate whether altering dietary fat, soy protein,
and isoflavone content affects the growth rate of a human
androgen-sensitive prostate cancer cell line (LNCaP) grown
in severe-combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice. SCID
mice were randomized into four dietary groups: high-fat
(42.0 kcal%) + casein, high-fat (42.0 kcal%) + soy protein +
isoflavone extract, low-fat (12.0 kcal%) + casein, and low-fat
(12.0 kcal%) + soy protein + isoflavone extract. After two
weeks on these diets, the mice were injected subcutaneously
with 1 ´ 105 LNCaP tumor cells and placed in separate cages
(1 mouse/cage) to strictly control caloric intake. Isocaloric di-
ets were given 3 days/wk, and tumor sizes were measured once
per week. The tumor growth rates were slightly reduced in the
group that received the low-fat + soy protein + isoflavone ex-
tract diet compared with the other groups combined (p <
0.05). In addition, the final tumor weights were reduced by
15% in the group that received the low-fat + soy protein +
isoflavone extract diet compared with the other groups com-
bined (p < 0.05). In this xenograft model for prostate cancer,
there were statistically significant effects on tumor growth
rate and final tumor weight attributable to a low-fat + soy
protein + isoflavone extract diet.

Introduction

In the United States, prostate cancer is the most com-
monly diagnosed cancer in men as well as the second lead-
ing cause of male cancer-related deaths (1). It is estimated
that in 1999 there will be 179,300 new prostate cancer cases
and 37,000 men will die from the disease (1). Although la-
tent or clinically insignificant prostate cancer occurs in a

large proportion and at equal rates in autopsy studies among
men of Asian countries and the United States (approx 30%
of men >50 yr old), the incidence of clinically significant
prostate cancer is 15-fold higher in the United States (1–4).
Furthermore, Chinese and Japanese men who immigrate to
this country have an increased incidence and mortality from
prostate cancer compared with Chinese and Japanese men in
their native country (5–8). These epidemiological studies
suggest that environmental factors associated with Western
culture may promote the development of clinical prostate
cancer. Two such dietary factors that have been implicated
are dietary fat and soy protein. A number of epidemiological
studies have shown a positive association between intake of
dietary fat and the incidence and mortality from prostate
cancer (8–12). Furthermore, a recent study by Wang and
co-workers (13) showed that androgen receptor-positive hu-
man prostate cancer cells (LNCaP) had greater tumor
weights and growth rates in nude mice fed a diet high in
polyunsaturated fat (40.5 kcal%) than in mice fed diets
lower in fat content (21.2, 11.6, and 2.3 kcal%) (13).

One of the major differences between Asian and Ameri-
can diets is the consumption of soy-based foodstuffs. Cow-
ard and colleagues (14) reported the average consumption of
soy protein in Taiwan to be 35 g/day per capita (14). The
beneficial effects of soy have been attributed to the iso-
flavones found in highest content in soy, e.g., genistein and
daidzein (15,16). Genistein and daidzein, and their
b-glucoside conjugates, are present in soybeans in concen-
trations of up to 3 mg/g, and the average isoflavone intake in
the Asian culture is estimated to be 39 mg/day (17,18). The
average American eats, at most, a few milligrams of
isoflavones per day (15). The decrease in prostate cancer
mortality in Japanese men compared with those in the
United States may be attributed, in part, to the high soy pro-
tein content in the Japanese diet (16). Whereas a number of
investigators have shown that genistein inhibits the growth
of human prostate cancer cell lines in vitro, no experiments

have evaluated the effect of soy protein and isoflavones on
the growth of human prostate cancer in vivo. This study was
specifically designed to evaluate whether altering dietary
fat, soy protein, and isoflavone content affects the implanta-
tion rate and growth rate of a human androgen-sensitive
prostate cancer cell line (LNCaP) grown in severe-combined
immunodeficient (SCID) mice.

Methods

Cells and Reagents

The androgen receptor-positive LNCaP cell line was ob-
tained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rock-
ville, MD). The LNCaP cells were grown in RPMI 1640
medium supplemented with L-glutamine, 10% fetal bovine
serum (Omega Scientific, Tarzana, CA), and penicillin-
streptomycin in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and air at 37°C.

Animals

Sixty-six male CB17 beige SCID mice (8 wk old) were ob-
tained from the Department of Laboratory Animal Medicine
Facility at the University of California, Los Angeles, which is
accredited by the American Association for Accreditation of
Laboratory Animal Care. The mice were initially housed five
per cage for two weeks while they received their respective
diets, then, after tumor inoculation, mice were housed one per
cage. The cages were kept in a sterile and pathogen-free envi-
ronment. Cages, bedding, and water were autoclaved before
use. The feeding receptacles were in the top of the cages, so
caloric intake could be monitored and new feedings given
without the cage being opened. Strict sterile technique was

used whenever the cages, mice, and feed were handled. Ap-
proval for the experiments was obtained from the University
of California, Los Angeles, Chancellor’s Animal Research
Committee, and all animals were cared for in accordance with
the Institutional Guidelines.

Diets

The ingredients of the four experimental diets (prepared
by Dyets, Bethlehem, PA) are listed in Table 1. Corn oil was
used as the source of fat, and the fat calories from corn oil
were balanced with carbohydrate calories from cornstarch.
The protein source was soy protein isolate (Supro 670 HG,
donated by Protein Technologies International, St. Louis,
MO) or casein. The soy protein isolate (Supro 670 HG) con-
tains the following isoflavones: 0.078% conjugated geni-
stein, 0.107% unconjugated genistein, 0.037% conjugated
daidzein, 0.052% unconjugated daidzein, 0.006% conju-
gated glycitein, and 0.009% unconjugated glycitein by
weight. The soy isoflavone extract (PTI-G2535, donated by
Protein Technologies International, St. Louis, MO) contains
the following unconjugated isoflavones: 43.7% genistein,
21.8% daidzein, and 3.4% glycitein by weight. The total of
isoflavones in each soy protein-containing diet was 0.18%
by weight. The diets were radiated to obtain sterility. During
the experiments, the diets were stored at 5°C.

Feeding Protocol

After tumor injection, mice were housed one mouse per
cage to allow us to give the mice specific quantities of food
and to accurately measure the caloric intake of the mice dur-
ing the experiment. Three times a week the mice were given

fresh food. Each time the mice received fresh food, the calo-
ric intake from the prior feeding period was determined.
This was done by subtracting the amount of feed remaining
in the feeding receptacle from the amount available to each
mouse at the beginning of each feeding period. The average
caloric intake (from the prior feeding period) of all the mice
was calculated, and this amount was given to each mouse for
the subsequent feeding period. With this protocol, caloric in-
take was reduced for the mice with the highest intakes, while
mice with lower caloric intakes were given the opportunity
to increase their caloric consumption. This technique pro-
vided approximately equal caloric intake for all four groups
of mice (see Results).

Design of Experiments

LNCaP cells were harvested from subconfluent cultures
after incubation for one minute with 0.25% trypsin and
0.02% EDTA. After suspension in RPMI 1640 medium sup-
plemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, the live cells were
stained with trypan blue dye and counted manually with a
microscope and hemocytometer. The LNCaP cells were re-
suspended in ice-cold Matrigel (Collaborative Biomedical
Products, Bedford, MA) at a final concentration of 1 ´ 105
cells/0.2 ml Matrigel. Each mouse was given a subcutaneous
inoculation of 1 ´ 105 tumor cells in the lateral abdomen
with a disposable syringe and a 26-gauge needle. An initial
experiment with 20 animals (5 in each dietary group) was
performed by injecting 1 ´ 106 tumor cells in 0.2 ml of
Matrigel per animal. When the tumors in these animals
reached 1.0–1.5 cm3, they caused the animals in all four di-
etary groups to become cachectic. This occurred in all ani-
mals at approximately seven weeks after tumor inoculation.
Therefore, 1 ´ 105 cells in 0.2 ml of Matrigel were used for
subsequent experiments to allow tumor growth over a longer
time period to evaluate the effect of the diets.

Two successive experiments were performed: the first
with five animals in each of the four dietary groups and the
second with six or seven animals in each of the four dietary
groups. The experiments were run separately because of
limited space and resources in our SCID mouse facility to
accommodate our one mouse per cage experimental design.
The data from both experiments were used for the statistical
analysis. All animals were randomly assigned to one of the
four dietary groups (high-fat + casein, high-fat + soy protein
+ isoflavones, low-fat + casein, or low-fat + soy protein +
isoflavones) and maintained on this diet for two weeks be-
fore tumor cell injection. All animals were kept on an
isocaloric diet, as described in Feeding Protocol. Once the
tumors became palpable, the dimensions were recorded
weekly through Week 12 of the experiment. Animal weights
were also recorded weekly. The tumor volumes were calcu-
lated using the following formula: length ´ width ´ height ´
0.5236 (20). Thirteen weeks after the initiation of the experi-
ment, all mice were sacrificed. Blood was collected and cen-
trifuged, and the serum was frozen at -70°C. The tumors
were dissected, weighed, and frozen in liquid nitrogen.

Determination of Serum Prostate-Specific Antigen and
Testosterone

Serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels were deter-
mined using an enzyme immunoassay kit (American Qualex
Antibodies, San Clemente, CA). Total serum testosterone
was determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays
(KMI Diagnostics, Minneapolis, MN). All the above assays
were performed in duplicate. The interassay variability was
<5.0%.

Statistical Analysis

A linear regression model was used to test the differences
of body weight, caloric intake, final tumor weight, PSA lev-
els, and testosterone levels among the four diet groups. Be-
cause this study consisted of two successive experiments,
“experiment” was also considered a covariate and, together
with baseline body weight and average weekly caloric in-
take, was included in the linear regression model. Baseline
body weight and average weekly caloric intake did not show
any significant association with tumor weight and PSA and
testosterone levels. Therefore, “experiment” was the only
covariate included in the final model. Growth rate was as-
sessed by repeatedly measuring tumor volumes over time. A
random coefficient model was developed to correlate tumor
volume, time (week), diet, and other covariates (experiment
and baseline body weight). Covariates that did not show sig-
nificant association with tumor volume were excluded from
the model. Log-rank test was used to test the time to palpa-
ble tumor among the four diet groups. The above analyses
were also carried out comparing each individual dietary
group with the other three dietary groups combined.

Results

Forty-three (94%) of the 46 mice developed measurable
tumors: 10 (10/12) in the high-fat + casein group, 11 (11/11)
in the high-fat + soy protein + isoflavone group, 12 (12/12)
in the low-fat + casein group, and 10 (10/11) in the low-fat +
soy protein + isoflavone group. There was no significant dif-
ference in caloric intake among the animals in the four
groups (Figure 1). In addition, there was no significant dif-
ference in the body weights among the groups (Figure 2).
When the final tumor weight and tumor growth rate were
compared among the four dietary groups, there were no sig-
nificant differences. However, the final tumor weights in
mice fed the low-fat + soy protein + isoflavone diet were
15% less than the final tumor weights of the animals in the
other three groups combined (high-fat + casein, high-fat +
soy protein + isoflavone, and low-fat + casein) ( p = 0.0499,
general linear model) (Table 2). In addition, the growth rate
of the tumors in the mice fed the low-fat diet combined with
soy protein and isoflavones was lower than that in the other
three groups combined (Figure 3) ( p = 0.0382, mixed
model). There was no difference among the four groups in

one levels at 13 weeks were 70% lower in mice fed the
low-fat + soy protein + isoflavone diet than in the other
groups, but this was not statistically significant (Table 3).
There was no difference in PSA levels between the four

Discussion

In this study, we evaluated the effect of dietary fat, soy
protein, and soy isoflavones on the growth of human pros-
tate cancer cells in a xenograft SCID mouse model. We
found that combining a low-fat diet (12 kcal%) with soy pro-
tein (20 kcal%) and isoflavones (0.18% by weight) reduced
the tumor growth rate and the final tumor weights compared
with the other diets in our study.

In a prior study, Wang and co-workers (13) showed a sig-
nificant reduction in the growth of LNCaP tumors in nude
mice fed diets lower in fat (21.2, 11.6, and 2.3 kcal%) com-
pared with mice fed a high-fat diet (40.5 kcal%). In our
study, there was a trend toward decreased tumor weights in
the low-fat + casein group compared with the high-fat + ca-
sein group, although this did not reach statistical signifi-
cance. It may be that, with a larger sample size, this
difference between the low-fat and high-fat groups may
have reached statistical significance. An alternative explana-
tion for the differences in the results of our study and those
of Wang and co-workers may be explained by differences in
the experimental designs. In our study, the one animal per
cage design allowed for an isocaloric feeding protocol. In
the study by Wang and co-workers, there were multiple ani-
mals per cage, and therefore caloric intake was not strictly
controlled or monitored. It is possible that the marked differ-

ence between the low-fat and high-fat groups observed by
Wang and co-workers may be due to a difference in caloric
intake, since higher energy intake may lead to increased tu-
mor growth (21). An alternative explanation may relate to
the animal model that we used. Whereas nude mice (used by
Wang and co-workers) possess B cell immunity, SCID mice
lack T cell, B cell, and natural killer cell immunity. It may be
that nutrition is interacting with the immune system in the
nude mouse to cause more dramatic differences in tumor
size.

The role of soy protein and isoflavones in the prevention
and treatment of prostate cancer remains largely undefined
and is actively being studied at a number of centers. Re-
search has focused on the isoflavone genistein and its effects
on prostate cancer cell lines. Genistein has been shown to in-
hibit the growth of human prostate cancer cell lines in tissue
culture and in histoculture (22,23). In addition, genistein
also inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis of prostate
cancer cell lines (24). Soy protein also contains noniso-
flavone substances with anticancer properties (Bowman-
Burke inhibitor), which may also be responsible for the
growth-inhibitory effect seen in the present study (25).

In this study, altering the fat, soy, and isoflavone content
had no effect on the PSA levels. PSA is a well-known
marker for prostate cancer progression that correlates with
tumor growth and metastases (26). Because the low-fat diet
high in soy protein and isoflavone caused only a 15% reduc-
tion in the final tumor weight in this experiment, this effect
may not be large enough to cause a significant change in the
serum PSA level. Alternatively, the diet may have inhibited
the growth of a population of the tumor cells that do not pro-
duce PSA. In the present study, the mice fed the low-fat diet
high in soy protein and isoflavones had a 70% decrease in
total testosterone levels, although this did not reach statisti-
cal significance. Wang and co-workers (13) also found that
low-fat diets failed to reduce serum testosterone levels. Al-
though several studies found a correlation between low-fat
diets and circulating androgen levels, further investigation is
required in this area (27,28). Low-fat diets may cause a re-
duction in bioavailable testosterone (free testosterone) levels
by increasing sex hormone-binding globulin levels, although
further investigations are needed in this area as well (29).
In conclusion, in this xenograft model for prostate cancer,
there were statistically significant effects on tumor growth
rate and final tumor weight attributable to a low-fat diet
combined with soy protein and isoflavones.

Diet and the evolution of human amylase gene copy
number variation

Starch consumption is a prominent characteristic of
agricultural societies and hunter-gatherers in arid
environments. In contrast, rainforest and circum-arctic hunter-
gatherers and some pastoralists consume much less starch1–3.
This behavioral variation raises the possibility that different
selective pressures have acted on amylase, the enzyme
responsible for starch hydrolysis4. We found that copy number
of the salivary amylase gene (AMY1) is correlated positively
with salivary amylase protein level and that individuals from
populations with high-starch diets have, on average, more
AMY1 copies than those with traditionally low-starch diets.
Comparisons with other loci in a subset of these populations
suggest that the extent of AMY1 copy number differentiation is
highly unusual. This example of positive selection on a copy
number–variable gene is, to our knowledge, one of the ﬁrst
discovered in the human genome. Higher AMY1 copy numbers
and protein levels probably improve the digestion of starchy
foods and may buffer against the ﬁtness-reducing effects
of intestinal disease.

Hominin evolution is characterized by signiﬁcant dietary shifts,
facilitated in part by the development of stone tool technology,
the control of ﬁre and, most recently, the domestication of plants
and animals5–7. Starch, for instance, has become an increasingly
prominent component of
the human diet, particularly among
agricultural societies8. It stands to reason, therefore, that studies of
the evolution of amylase in humans and our close primate relatives
may provide insight into our ecological history. Because the human
salivary amylase gene (AMY1) shows extensive variation in copy
number9,10, we ﬁrst assessed whether a functional relationship exists
between AMY1 copy number and the amount of amylase protein
in saliva. We then determined if AMY1 copy number differs
among modern human populations with contrasting amounts of
dietary starch.

We estimated diploid AMY1 gene copy number for 50 European
Americans using an AMY1-speciﬁc real-time quantitative PCR
(qPCR) assay. We observed extensive variation in AMY1 copy number
in this population sample (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Table 1
online), consistent with previous studies10,11. Next, we performed
protein blot experiments with saliva samples from the same indivi-
duals in order to estimate salivary amylase protein levels (Fig. 1b).
These experiments showed a signiﬁcant positive correlation between
salivary amylase gene copy number and protein expression (P o
0.001; Fig. 1c).

AMY1 expression, such as regulatory region SNPs or nongenetic factors
that may include individual hydration status, stress level and short-term
dietary habits.

Figure 2 Diet and AMY1 copy number variation. (a) Comparison of qPCR-
estimated AMY1 diploid copy number frequency distributions for populations
with traditional diets that incorporate many starch-rich foods (high-starch)
and populations with traditional diets that include little or no starch (low-
starch). (b) Cumulative distribution plot of diploid AMY1 copy number for
each of the seven populations in the study.

Supplementary Fig. 1 online). Notably, the proportion of individuals
from the combined high-starch sample with at least six AMY1 copies
(70%) was nearly two times greater than that for low-starch popula-
tions (37%). To visualize the allele-speciﬁc number and orientation of
AMY1 gene copies, we performed high-resolution FISH on stretched
DNA ﬁbers (ﬁber FISH); these results were consistent with diploid
AMY1 copy number estimates from our qPCR experiments (Fig. 3).
The among-population patterns of AMY1 copy number variation
do not ﬁt expectations under a simple geographical region–based
model of genetic drift: our high- and low-starch samples include both
African and Asian populations, suggesting that diet more strongly
predicts AMY1 copy number than geographic proximity. Based on this
observation, we hypothesized that natural selection may have inﬂu-
enced AMY1 copy number in certain human populations. However,
we cannot rigorously test such a hypothesis on the basis of our qPCR
results alone, in part because we lack comparative data from other
loci. Therefore, we next performed array-based comparative genomic
hybridization (aCGH) on the Yakut population sample with a whole-
genome tile path (WGTP) array platform that was previously used11
to describe genome-wide patterns of copy number variation in 270
individuals (the HapMap collection), including the same Japanese
population sample as in our study. For the Yakut aCGH experiments,
we used the same reference DNA sample (NA10851) as in the previous
study11,
Japanese and Yakut relative
intensity log2 ratios for the 26,574 BAC clones on the array, including
two clones mapped to the AMY1 locus.

Although there is a considerable range of variation in dietary starch
intake among human populations, a distinction can be made between
‘high-starch’ populations for which starchy food resources comprise a
substantial portion of the diet and the small fraction of ‘low-starch’
populations with traditional diets that incorporate relatively few
starchy foods. Such diets instead emphasize proteinaceous resources
(for example, meats and blood) and simple saccharides (for example,
from fruit, honey and milk). To determine if AMY1 copy number
differs among populations with high- and low-starch diets, we
estimated AMY1 copy number in three high-starch and four low-
starch population samples. Our high-starch sample included two
agricultural populations, European Americans (n ¼ 50) and Japanese
(n ¼ 45), and Hadza hunter-gatherers who rely extensively on starch-
rich roots and tubers (n ¼ 38)12. Low-starch populations included
Biaka (n ¼ 36) and Mbuti (n ¼ 15) rainforest hunter-gatherers, Datog
pastoralists (n ¼ 17) and the Yakut, a pastoralist, ﬁshing society (n ¼
25). Additional details on the diets of these populations are provided
in Supplementary Table 2 online. We found that mean diploid AMY1
copy number was greater in high-starch populations (Fig. 2 and

estimates. Red (B10 kb) and green (B8 kb) probes encompass the entire
AMY1 gene and a retrotransposon directly upstream of (and unique to)
AMY1, respectively. (a) Japanese individual GM18972 was estimated by
qPCR to have 14 (13.73 ± 0.93) diploid AMY1 gene copies, consistent with
ﬁber FISH results showing one allele with ten copies and the other with four
copies. (b) Biaka individual GM10472 was estimated by qPCR to have six
(6.11 ± 0.17) diploid AMY1 gene copies, consistent with ﬁber FISH results.
(c) The reference chimpanzee (Clint; S006006) was conﬁrmed to have two
diploid AMY1 gene copies.

Results from the two AMY1-mapped clones on the WGTP array
supported our original observations: the log2 ratios were strongly
correlated with the qPCR estimates of AMY1 diploid copy number
(Supplementary Fig. 1), and the population mean log2 ratios for both
clones were greater for the Japanese sample (Fig. 4a and Supplemen-
tary Fig. 1). More importantly, with the WGTP data, we were able to
compare the extent of population differentiation at the AMY1 locus to
other loci in the genome for the two Asian population samples in our
study. We would expect the magnitude and direction of the Japanese-
Yakut mean log2 ratio difference for the AMY1-mapped clones to be
similar to those for other copy number–variable clones, if these CNVs
have experienced similar evolutionary pressures. However, the two
AMY1-mapped clones are signiﬁcant outliers in this distribution
(Fig. 4b and Supplementary Fig. 2 online), leading us to reject this
null hypothesis. In addition, we considered a database of genotypes for
783 genome-wide microsatellites for the same Yakut individuals and a
different Japanese population sample13, because microsatellite loci are
usually multiallelic (as is the AMY1 locus). We found that the extent of
Japanese-Yakut differentiation at the AMY1 locus exceeded that for
497% of the microsatellite loci (Supplementary Fig. 3 online).
Although this result should be interpreted with caution because we
do not know whether AMY1 copy number and microsatellite muta-
tion rates and patterns are similar, this ﬁnding is consistent with our
results from the WGTP comparison.

These observations suggest that natural selection has shaped AMY1
copy number variation in either the Japanese or the Yakut or in both
populations. We cannot fully test the null hypothesis for the other
high- and low-starch populations in our study, but the patterns of
copy number variation we observed in these populations are similar to
those for the Japanese and Yakut and thus may also reﬂect non-neutral
evolution. We favor a model in which AMY1 copy number has been
subject to positive or directional selection in at least some high-starch
populations but has evolved neutrally (that is, through genetic drift) in
low-starch populations. Although it is possible that lower AMY1 gene
copy numbers have been favored by selection in low-starch popula-
tions, such an interpretation is less plausible for the simple reason that
excessive amylase production is unlikely to have a signiﬁcant negative
effect on ﬁtness. Furthermore, several lines of evidence offer mechan-
isms by which higher salivary amylase protein expression may confer a
ﬁtness advantage for individuals with a high-starch diet. First, a
signiﬁcant amount of starch digestion occurs in the mouth during
mastication14. For example, blood glucose has been shown to be
signiﬁcantly higher when high-starch foods such as corn, rice and
potatoes (but not low-starch foods such as apples) are ﬁrst chewed
and then swallowed, rather than swallowed directly15. In addition, it
has been suggested that oral digestion of starch is critically important
for energy absorption during episodes of diarrhea4. Diarrheal diseases
can have a signiﬁcant effect on ﬁtness; for example, such diseases
caused 15% of worldwide deaths among children younger than 5 years
as recently as 2001 (ref. 16). Last, salivary amylase persists in the
stomach and intestines after swallowing17, thereby augmenting the
enzymatic activity of pancreatic amylase in the small intestine. Higher
AMY1 copy number and a concomitant increase in salivary amylase
protein thus are likely to improve the efﬁciency with which high-
starch foods are digested in the mouth, stomach and intestines and
may also buffer against the potential ﬁtness-reducing effects of
intestinal disease.

To understand better

evolutionary context of human
AMY1 copy number variation, we analyzed patterns of AMY1 copy
number variation in chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and bonobos
(Pan paniscus). In contrast to the extensive copy number variation

we observed in humans, each of 15 wild-born western chimpanzees
(P. t. verus) showed evidence of only two diploid AMY1 copies (Fig. 3c
and Supplementary Fig. 4 online), consistent with previous ﬁnd-
ings18–21. Although we observed evidence of a gain in AMY1 copy
number in bonobos relative to chimpanzees (Supplementary Fig. 4),
our sequence-based analyses suggest that each of these AMY1 copies
has a disrupted coding sequence and may be nonfunctional (Supple-
mentary Fig. 5 online). Therefore, the average human has roughly
three times more AMY1 copies than chimpanzees, and bonobos may
not have salivary amylase at all. Outgroup comparisons with other
great apes suggest that AMY1 copy number was probably gained in the
human lineage, rather than lost in chimpanzees21,22. Given that AMY1
copy number is positively correlated with salivary amylase protein
expression in humans, it stands to reason that the human-speciﬁc
increase in copy number may explain, at least in part, why salivary
amylase protein levels are approximately six to eight times higher in
humans than in chimpanzees23. These patterns are consistent with the
general dietary characteristics of Pan and Homo; chimpanzees and
bonobos are predominantly frugivorous and ingest little starch relative
to most human populations24.

Among other primates, New World monkeys do not produce
salivary amylase and tend to consume little starch, but cercopithecines

mangabeys) have relatively high salivary amylase expression, even
compared to humans23. Although the genetic mechanisms are
unknown, this expression pattern may have evolved to facilitate
the digestion of starchy foods (such as the seeds of unripe fruits)
stowed in the cheek pouch, a trait that, among primates, is unique
to cercopithecines25.

The initial human-speciﬁc increase in AMY1 copy number may
have been coincident with a dietary shift early in hominin evolu-
tionary history. For example, it is hypothesized that starch-rich plant
underground storage organs (USOs) such as bulbs, corms and tubers
were a critical food resource for early hominins26,27. Changes in USO
consumption may even have facilitated the initial emergence and
spread of Homo erectus out of Africa5,28. Yet such arguments are
difﬁcult to test, mainly because direct evidence for the use of USOs is
difﬁcult to obtain, particularly for more remote time periods. USOs
themselves are perishable, as are many of the tools used to collect and
process them. Therefore, understanding the timing and nature of the
initial human-lineage AMY1 duplications may provide insight into
our ecological and evolutionary history. The low amount of nucleotide
sequence divergence among the three AMY1 gene copies found in the
human genome reference sequence (hg18; d ¼ 0.00011 to 0.00056)
implies a relatively recent origin that may be within the time frame of
modern human origins (that is, within the last B200,000 years; based
on human-chimpanzee AMY1 d ¼ 0.027 and using an estimate of
6 million years ago for divergence of the human and chimpanzee
lineages). However, given the possibility for gene conversion, we do
not necessarily consider this estimate to be reliable. The generation of
AMY1 sequences from multiple humans may ultimately help to shed
light on this issue.

In summary, we have shown that the pattern of variation in copy
number of the human AMY1 gene is consistent with a history of diet-
related selection pressures, demonstrating the importance of starchy
foods in human evolution. Although the amylase locus is one of
the most variable in the human genome with regard to copy
number10, it is by no means unique; a recent genome-wide survey
identiﬁed 1,447 copy number–variable regions among 270 pheno-
typically normal human individuals11, and many more such regions
are likely to be discovered with advances in copy number variation
detection technology. It is reasonable to speculate that copy number
variants other than AMY1 are or have been subject to strong pressures
of natural selection, particularly given their potential
inﬂuence
on transcriptional and translational levels (for example, see ref. 29).
The characterization of copy number variation among humans and
between humans and other primates promises considerable insight
into our evolutionary history.

METHODS
Samples. Buccal swabs and saliva were collected under informed consent from
50 European Americans ages 18–30 (Arizona State University institutional
review board (IRB) protocol number 0503002355). Saliva was collected for
3 min from under the tongue. Buccal swabs were collected from the Hadza
(n ¼ 38) and Datog (n ¼ 17) from Tanzania (Stanford University IRB protocol
number 9798-414). Genomic DNA samples from the Biaka (Central African
Republic; n ¼ 32), Mbuti (Democratic Republic of Congo; n ¼ 15) and Yakut
(Siberia; n ¼ 25) are from the HGDP-CEPH Human Genome Diversity Cell
Line Panel. Lymphoblastoid cell lines from 45 Japanese, 4 additional Biaka and
the donor for the chimpanzee genome sequence (Clint) were obtained from the
Coriell Institute for Medical Research. Whole blood samples were collected
during routine veterinary examinations from chimpanzees and bonobos
housed at various zoological and research facilities. Two additional bonobo
samples were obtained from the Integrated Primate Biomaterials and Informa-
tion Resource. DNA was isolated using standard methods.

Copy number estimation. Primers for qPCR (Supplementary Table 3 online)
were designed to be speciﬁc to AMY1 (that is, to have sequence mismatches
with AMY2A and AMY2B) based on the human and chimpanzee reference
genome sequences. A previous study reported a single (haploid) copy of AMY1
for one chimpanzee18, and a recent analysis19 did not ﬁnd any evidence of
recent AMY1 duplication for Clint. We used ﬁber FISH to conﬁrm that Clint
has two diploid copies of AMY1 (Fig. 3c). Therefore, we were able to estimate
diploid copy number based on relative AMY1 quantity for human DNA
compared to a standard curve constructed from the DNA of Clint. A fragment
from the TP53 gene was also ampliﬁed to adjust for DNA dilution quantity
variation. Samples were run in triplicate and standards in duplicate. Experi-
ments were performed and analyzed as described previously20.

Protein blot analysis. Protein samples were prepared by solubilizing saliva
samples in 2% SDS and heating at 100 1C for 5 min. These samples were
analyzed on mini SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to polyvinylidene
diﬂuoride (PVDF) membranes (Immobilon-Millipore). For quantiﬁcation
purposes, a human salivary amylase protein sample of known quantity (Sigma)
was run on each gel, with 5 mL of saliva for each sample. After transfer,
the membranes were incubated for 1.5 h with primary antibodies raised
against human salivary amylase (Sigma). The membranes were washed and
goat anti-rabbit alkaline phosphatase–conjugated IgG secondary antibodies
(Pierce) were added for 1 h. The membranes were exposed to ECF substrate
(Amersham Biosciences) for 5 min and then analyzed using a phosphorimager.
Quantiﬁcation of protein bands was performed using ImageQuant software
(Molecular Dynamics).

Fiber FISH. DNA ﬁbers were prepared by gently lysing cultured lymphoblast
cells with 300 ml Cell Lysis Buffer (Gentra Systems) per 5 million cells. 10 ml of
lysate was placed on a poly-L-lysine–coated slide (LabScientiﬁc) and mechani-
cally stretched with the edge of a coverslip. After 30 s, 300 ml of 100% methanol
was applied to ﬁx the ﬁbers. Slides were dried at 37 1C for 5 min and then
stored at room temperature (22–25 1C).

PCR product probes were made from (i) the entire AMY1 gene itself
(B10 kb; red in images) and (ii) the retrotransposon found directly upstream
of all AMY1 copies but not of pancreatic amylase genes or amylase pseudogenes
(B8 kb; green in images). The gene probe may not be speciﬁc to AMY1 under
all hybridization conditions (AMY1 sequence divergence with AMY2A and
AMY2B ¼ 7.5% and 7.1%, respectively), but the upstream probe is. We used
long-range PCR followed by nested PCR for each region (primers and
conditions are provided in Supplementary Table 3). PCR products were
puriﬁed with DNA Clean and Concentrator columns (Zymo).
For each nested PCR product, 750 ng was combined with 20 ml 2.5
random primer (BioPrime aCGH Labeling Module, Invitrogen) in a total
volume of 39 ml. Samples were incubated at 100 1C for 5 min and were then
placed on ice for 5 min. Next, 5 ml 10 dUTP and 1 ml Exo-Klenow Fragment
(BioPrime Module) and either 5 ml (5 nmol) Biotin-16-dUTP (Roche; gene
probe) or 5 ml (5 nmol) digoxigenin-11-dUTP (Roche; upstream probe) were
added, and samples were incubated at 37 1C for 5 h. Labeled products were
puriﬁed with Microcon Centrifugal Filter Devices (Millipore) using three
washes of 300 ml 0.1 SSC, eluted with 50 ml H2O. For each 1 mg of labeled
DNA, we added 10 mg human Cot-1 DNA (Invitrogen).

For each experiment, 500 ng of labeled DNA from each of the nested PCR
reactions was combined, lyophilized, reconstituted in 10 ml hybridization buffer
(50% formamide, 20% dextran sulfate, 2 SSC) and added to the slide (18 
18 mm cover glass; Fisher). Fibers and probes were denatured together
(95 1C for 3 min) and hybridized in a humidiﬁed chamber (37 1C for 40 h).
The slide was washed in 0.5 SSC at 75 1C for 5 min followed by three washes
in 1 PBS at room temperature (22–25 1C) for 2 min each. Next, ﬁbers were
incubated with 200 ml CAS Block (Zymed) and 10% (vol/vol) normal goat
serum (Zymed) for 20 min at room temperature (22–25 1C) under a HybriSlip
(Invitrogen). We used a three-step detection and ampliﬁcation (with reagents
in 200 ml CAS Block with 10% (vol/vol) normal goat serum). Each step was
conducted for 30 min at room temperature under a HybriSlip followed by
three washes in 1 PBS for 2 min each at room temperature (22–25 1C).
Reagents were as follows for each step: step (i): 1:500 anti-digoxigenin-
ﬂuorescein, Fab fragments (Roche) and 1:500 Strepavidin, Alexa Fluor 594

aCGH analysis. For aCGH experiments, we used a large-insert clone DNA
microarray covering the human genome in tiling path resolution30. Test
genomic DNA samples (from Yakut individuals) and reference genomic
DNA samples (from NA10851) were labeled with Cy3-dCTP and Cy5-dCTP,
respectively (NEN Life Science Products) and were cohybridized to the array.
For each sample, a duplicate experiment was performed in dye-swap to reduce
false-positive error rates. Labeling, hybridization, washes and analyses were
performed as described11,30.

Abstract

Folate metabolism supports the synthesis of nucleotides as
well as the transfer of methyl groups. Polymorphisms
in folate-metabolizing enzymes have been shown to affect
risk of colorectal neoplasia and other malignancies. Using
data from a population-based incident case-control study
(1,600 cases and 1,962 controls), we investigated associations
between genetic variants in the reduced folate carrier (RFC),
thymidylate synthase (TS), methionine synthase (MTR),
and 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) and
colon cancer risk. The TS enhancer region (TSER) variant
was associated with a reduced risk among men [2rpt/2rpt
versus 3rpt/3rpt wild-type; odds ratio (OR), 0.7; 95%
confidence interval, 0.6-0.98] but not women. When com-
bined genotypes for both TS polymorphisms (TSER and
3V-untranslated region 1494delTTAAAG) were evaluated,
ORs for variant genotypes were generally below 1.0, with
statistically significantly reduced risks among women.

Neither MTR D919G nor RFC 80G>A polymorphisms were
associated with altered colon cancer risk. Because folate
metabolism is characterized by interrelated reactions, we
evaluated gene-gene interactions. Genotypes resulting in
reduced MTHFR activity in conjunction with low TS
expression were associated with a reduced risk of colon
cancer. When dietary intakes were taken into account,
individuals with at least one variant TSER allele (3rpt/2rpt
or 2rpt/2rpt) were at reduced risk in the presence of a low
folate intake. This study supports findings from adenoma
studies indicating that purine synthesis may be a relevant
biological mechanism linking folate metabolism to colon
cancer risk. A pathway-based approach to data analysis is
needed to help discern the independent and combined
effects of dietary intakes and genetic variability in folate
(Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev 2005;
metabolism.

Introduction

Folate is an essential micronutrient in humans, the primary
function of which is as a carrier of single-carbon units. Folate-
dependent reactions include the biosynthesis of thymidylate,
purines, methionine, and glycine thus linking it to nucleotide
synthesis as well as the provision of methyl groups (1).
High dietary folate intakes, or biomarkers thereof, have
been associated with a reduced risk of colon cancer or its pre-
cursors in most, although not all, studies (2-5). Several studies
showing associations with genetic polymorphisms in folate-
metabolizing enzymes lend support to a causal relationship
between folate and colorectal carcinogenesis (6-10). Biological
mechanisms linking folate to colorectal carcinogenesis include
an altered provision of S-adenosylmethionine for methylation
reactions, including DNA methylation, and changes in the
availability of nucleotides, such as thymidylate, for DNA
synthesis and repair (11, 12).

We have previously reported on associations between
polymorphisms in 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase
(MTHFR) and risk of colon cancer (13). Here, we extend this
work to common genetic variants in thymidylate synthase
(TS), the reduced folate carrier (RFC), and methionine synthase
(MTR) in relation to colon cancer risk. TS is a key enzyme in
folate metabolism that catalyzes the conversion of dUMP to
dTMP for the provision of thymidine, a rate-limiting nucleo-

tide essential for DNA synthesis and repair (see Fig. 1). TS is
also a primary target for major chemotherapeutic agents,
including 5-fluorouracil. We investigated the role of a poly-
morphism in the 5V-untranslated region (5V-UTR) enhancer
region (three or two repeats of a 28-bp sequence), resulting in
reduced TS expression among those with fewer repeats (14)
and a 6-bp insertion or deletion (1,494 bp in the 3V-UTR) that
affects mRNA stability (15, 16).

RFC is responsible for the active transport of 5-methyl-
tetrahydrofolate from plasma to cytosol. A polymorphism in
the RFC gene (80G>A, Arg27His) seems associated with a
higher affinity for folate (17). Among 169 healthy individuals
who were stratified by MTHFR 677C>T genotype, the variant
A allele was consistently and linearly associated with higher
plasma folate concentrations (17). Furthermore, concentrations
of methotrexate 24 to 48 hours after administration were
higher among children with acute leukemia homozygous for
the variant A allele, providing additional support for differ-
ential carrier activity among those with variant genotypes (18).
MTR catalyzes the methylation of homocysteine to methi-
onine with simultaneous conversion of 5-methyl-tetrahydro-
folate to tetrahydrofolate (Fig. 1). A variant in the MTR gene
(2756A>G, Asp919Gly; ref. 19) may affect plasma homocysteine
concentrations. Some studies (20, 21) but not others (22-24)
have found that homocysteine concentrations tend to decrease
linearly across genotypes, with the AA genotype associated
with the highest homocysteine concentrations. Studies on
colorectal neoplasia have been inconsistent: the GG genotype
has been associated with a somewhat reduced risk of colo-
rectal cancer (22, 25) yet a possible increased risk of colorectal
adenoma (26).

In this large population-based case-control study of colon
cancer, we sought to evaluate the role of these polymorphisms
in defining colon cancer risk, either alone or in interaction with
specific nutrient intakes and other genotypes. Furthermore, as

some of the associations of folate metabolism may differ by
estrogen exposure (13), possibly because of mechanisms
attributable to hypermethylation of
the estrogen receptor
(27), we evaluated interactions with postmenopausal hormone
(PMH) use.

Materials and Methods

Participants were African American, Caucasian, or Hispanic
subjects from the Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Program of
Northern California, an eight-county area in Utah, and the
metropolitan Twin Cities area of Minnesota. Eligibility criteria
for cases included diagnosis with first-primary incident colon
cancer (International Classification of Diseases for Oncology, 2nd
edition codes 18.0, 18.2-18.9) between October 1, 1991 and
September 30, 1994; between 30 and 79 years of age at time of
diagnosis; and mentally competent to complete the interview.
Proximal tumors were defined as cecum through transverse
colon; tumors in the splenic flexure and descending and
sigmoid colon were categorized as distal. Cases with
adenocarcinoma or carcinoma of the rectosigmoid junction
or rectum (defined as the first 15 cm from the anal opening)
or with known familial adenomatous polyposis, ulcerative
colitis, or Crohn’s disease were not eligible. Of all cases
identified, 65% of those contacted consented to participate in
the study. Controls who had never had a previous colorectal
tumor were randomly selected in proportion to the cases
within the geographically defined areas from Kaiser Perma-
nente Medical Care Program membership lists in California;
driver’s license lists, random digit dialing, or Centers for
Medicare and Medicaid Services lists, formerly known as the
Health Care Finance Administration, for Utah; and driver’s

license or state identification lists in Minnesota. Controls were
frequency matched to cases by sex and 5-year age group.
These methods have been described in detail (28). Of all
controls selected, 64% participated.

Data Collection. Trained interviewers collected diet and
lifestyle data in person using laptop computers. Study quality
control methods have been described (29, 30). The reference
period for the study was the calendar year f2 years before
date of diagnosis (cases) or date of selection (controls). Dietary
intake data were ascertained using an adaptation of the valid-
ated Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults
diet history questionnaire (31). Participants were asked to
determine which foods were eaten and the frequency with
which foods were eaten. Nutrients were calculated using the
Minnesota Nutrition Coordinating Center’s nutrient database,
version 19.

TS, MTR, and RFC genotyping. Of 4,403 cases and controls
with valid study data, 3,680 (84%) had blood collected
primarily during the in-person interview, or during a clinical
visit (83% of cases and 85% of controls). Genomic DNA was
extracted using methods described in (refs. 14, 32). All samples
were genotyped for two polymorphisms in the TS gene (TSER,
3V-UTR 1494delTTAAAG), MTR D919G, and RFC 80G>A.
A total of 3,562 (97% of cases and 97% of controls with blood
collected) had genotype information for both TSER and 3V-UTR
1494delTTAAAG. 5V-Nuclease assays that had been previously
used to genotype other polymorphisms in the folate pathway
(MTHFR 677C>T, MTHFR 1298A>C, and MTR D919G) have
been described (13, 26).

Both TS polymorphisms were analyzed using fluorescent
the TSER 28-bp
size discrimination. For the analysis of
repeat polymorphism, a fragment containing the repeats was

6FAM-GTGGCTCCTGCGTTTCCCCC-3V; reverse primer, 5V-
GGCTCCGAGCCGGCCACAGGCATGGCGCGG-3V(14). The
PCR reactions contained 1 GeneAmp buffer (Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, CA), 1.5 mmol/L MgCl2, 200 Amol/
L deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates, 100 nmol/L each primer,
10% DMSO, 1 unit AmpliTaq DNA polymerase (Applied
Biosystems), and 100 ng of genomic DNA. Cycling conditions
were one cycle of 94jC for 2 minutes; 35 cycles of 94jC for
30 seconds, 63jC for 30 seconds, and 72jC for 30 seconds; and
a final extension at 72jC for 5 minutes. The amplified
fragments were analyzed on an ABI 3100 genetic analyzer.
A fragment containing the 3V-UTR deletion was amplified
forward primer, 5V-6FAM-
using the following primers:
CAAATCTGAGGGAGCTGAGT-3V; reverse primer, 5V-CAGA-
TAAGTGGCAGTACAGA-3V. The PCR reactions contained 1
GeneAmp buffer, 2 mmol/L MgCl2, 150 Amol/L deoxynucleo-
tide triphosphates, 300 nmol/L each primer, 1 unit AmpliTaq
DNA polymerase, and 50 ng genomic DNA. Cycling con-
ditions were one cycle of 94jC for 5 minutes; 30 cycles of 94jC
for 30 seconds, 60jC for 45 seconds, and 72jC for 60 seconds;
and a final extension at 72jC for 10 minutes. The amplified
fragments were analyzed on an ABI 3100 genetic analyzer. For
both TS polymorphisms, the correlation between fragment size
and repeat number was confirmed by sequencing.

The 80G>A polymorphism in RFC was detected by allelic
discrimination using the 5V nuclease assay on a 7900HT
sequence detection system (ABI). The 5V-nuclease genotyping
assay was validated by genotyping 100 individuals by both
5V-nuclease assay and RFLP. There were no discrepancies
between the two assays. Genotyping of the 80G>A polymor-
phism was done in 20-AL reactions containing 1 Taqman
PCR core reagents (ABI), 3 mmol/L MgCl2, 200 nmol/L
each PCR primer (forward primer, 5V-AGCCCAGCGGTGGA-
GAAG-3Vand reverse primer, 5V-AGCCGTAGAAGCAAAGG-
TAGCA-3V), 150 nmol/L MGB probe 5V-VIC-TCCTGGC-
GGCGCC-3V (Applied Biosystems; G allele), 100 nmol/L
MGB probe 5V-6-FAM-TGGCGGCACCTCG-3V (A allele), 0.5
unit AmpliTaq Gold, 0.2 unit AmpErase UNG, and 5 ng
genomic DNA. The amplification cycles were 50jC for
5 minutes, 95jC for 10 minutes, and 40 cycles of 95jC for
15 seconds and 60jC for 1 minute. Positive controls for all the
genotypes as well as four negative controls were included in
each plate. For quality control of all the polymorphisms,
genotyping for 94 randomly selected samples was repeated.
There were no discrepancies.

Statistical Methods. Logistic regression models were used
to estimate associations in various ways. We stratified the data
by sex and estimated the risk of colon cancer given a certain
TS, MTR, or RFC genotype and examined risk estimates
further stratified by other population characteristics (e.g.,
tumor site and age). The combined effects of TSER and 3V-
UTR 1494delTTAAAG were calculated using individuals who
were homozygous for the common allele at both loci as the
reference group. We assessed the joint interaction between
genotype and level of nutrient intake by using those with low
nutrient intake and homozygous for the most common (wild
type) allele for TSER, 3V-UTR, MTR, or RFC as a common
reference point. We also assessed gene-gene interactions in the
folate pathway using the homozygous genotype for the most
common allele as the reference. Similarly,
the interaction
between genotype and recent estrogen status in postmeno-
pausal women was assessed using as the reference group no
PMH use and wild-type TS, MTR, or RFC genotype.

Maximum likelihood estimates of population TS haplotype
frequencies from unphased genotype data were obtained from
an expectation maximization algorithm, assuming Hardy-
Weinberg equilibrium, according to Excoffier and Slatkin (33)
using SAS/Genetics software, 2002 (SAS/Genetics, Cary, NC).

Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI)
were calculated from unconditional logistic regression models.
In these models, age at diagnosis or selection, body mass index
reported for the reference period (kg/m2), long-term vigorous
leisure time physical activity, total energy intake, dietary fiber,
dietary calcium, and number of cigarettes smoked per day on a
regular basis were included as covariates to adjust for potential
confounding. Haplotype-specific relative risks were assessed
according to methods described in Stram et al. (34) using
logistic regression software (SAS, release 8.2).

Separate analyses were done for men and women to
determine whether differences existed by sex, as most of the
literature has focused on either men or women. Assessment of
interactions among genotypes, diet, and the risk of colon
cancer were based on departure from additive risks using the
relative risk due to interaction formulation of Hosmer and
Lemeshow extended to more than two allelic combinations
and/or environmental exposures (35). Interaction using a
multiplicative scale was also examined. Interactions between

Polymorphisms and Colon Cancer Risk

genotypes and PMH use in postmenopausal women were
m2 test of the difference between slopes
assessed using a Wald
from the (assumed linear) change in ORs, keeping the wild-
type TS genotype constant across the varying genotypes for
the respective other TS polymorphism.

Results

Selected characteristics of the study population and MTHFR
genotype frequencies by case or control status are presented in
Table 1. The study participants were predominantly self-
identified as non-Hispanic Caucasian (92%), with the remain-
der Hispanic (4%) and African American (4%). All genotypes
were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (assessed separately for
cases and controls), and allele frequencies were consistent with
previous reports (36). The TS polymorphisms were in linkage
disequilibrium (DV= 0.46 among non-Hispanic Caucasians).

Table 2 describes the main associations seen with the poly-
morphisms, stratified by gender. Among men, TSER variant
genotypes were associated with a significantly decreased risk
(3rpt/2rpt: OR, 0.8; 95% CI, 0.6-0.98; 2rpt/2rpt: OR, 0.7; 95%
CI, 0.6-0.98). No such risk reduction was observed among
women. When combined genotypes (or diplotypes) for both
TS polymorphisms were considered, almost all of the ORs for
variant genotypes among both men and women were below
1.0, with statistically significantly reduced risks for women.
Risk estimates for TS haplotypes, including variant alleles,
compared with wild-type haplotype were not significantly
different from 1.0 (data not shown).

Neither the MTR D919G nor RFC 80G>A polymorphism
was associated with altered colon cancer risk among men or
women (Table 2).

Folate metabolism involves circulation of folate metabolites
through multiple cycles, as well as feedback mechanisms
between these cycles (Fig. 1). Therefore, we evaluated gene-
gene interactions between the polymorphisms investigated
here, as well as those we have reported on previously (8, 13).
ORs different from 1.0 were seen largely for stratifications of
TS, RFC, or MTR by MTHFR 677C>T or 1298A>C genotypes,

and these are presented in Table 3. Among men, reduced
risks associated with variant TS genotypes (e.g., the presence
of TSER 2rpt/2rpt or TS 3V-UTR deletion) were most
pronounced for those with MTHFR TT genotypes. The
MTHFR 1298CC genotype was associated with a decreased
risk among women; however,
this risk reduction seemed
independent of TS genotypes. There was no evidence for
interactions between MTR D919G or RFC 80G>A and
MTHFR genotypes.

We also investigated whether risk estimates associated
with polymorphisms in these folate-metabolizing enzymes
differed by dietary intakes of folate, methionine, alcohol, or
vitamins B6, B2, or B12. Consistent with our previous report
on colorectal adenoma (37) among men, the TSER variant
conferred a reduced risk in the presence of low folate intake
(lowest tertile < 318 Ag/d; TS 2rpt/2rpt or 2rpt/3rpt: OR,
0.7; 95% CI, 0.5-0.9 compared with wild-type 3rpt/3rpt). A
similar risk reduction with the TSER variant genotypes
was observed among men with low methionine intakes (<2.0
g/d): TS 2rpt/2rpt or 2rpt/3rpt (OR, 0.6; 95% CI, 0.4-0.9)
compared with wild-type 3rpt/3rpt. However, none of these
patterns was observed among women for the TS genotypes
nor for TS haplotypes in either sex. There were no clear
patterns or associations following stratification by vitamin B6
or B12 intake. No meaningful differences in risk were
observed for MTR genotypes when stratified by nutrient
intakes.

Among women in the lowest tertile of folate intake (V273
Ag/d), the RFC variant genotypes were associated with a
decreased risk (wild-type GG: OR, 1.0; GA or AA: OR, 0.7; 95%
CI, 0.5-1.0). Among women, we observed a significant gene-
nutrient interaction in that only those with the GG genotype
benefited from a diet higher in folate, whereas no difference in
risk with variable folate intake was seen among those with the
combined GA or AA genotypes (P interaction = 0.04, multiplica-
tive scale; P = 0.01, additive scale). This pattern was not seen
among men.

Because of the observed differences in risk patterns among
men and women and our past findings regarding an inter-
action between postmenopausal hormone use (PMH use) and

NOTE: Adjusted for age, BMI, lifetime vigorous leisure activity, energy intake, dietary fiber, dietary calcium, usual number of cigarettes smoked, and other TS
polymorphisms where appropriate (TSER, TS 3VUTR). P interaction values of gene-gene associations were not statistically significant on an additive or multiplicative scale
(data not shown).

MTHFR genotype, we investigated whether risk estimates of
TS, MTR, or RFC genotypes differed by PMH use. Among
PMH users, the variant TS genotypes were associated with
substantially reduced risk of colon cancer, whereas much
weaker associations were observed among non-PMH users
(Table 4). No such interactions were observed for MTR or RFC
(data not shown).

Discussion

Within this large population-based study of colon cancer, we
investigated polymorphisms in three folate-metabolizing
enzymes (TS, MTR, and MTHFR), as well as the relevant
carrier protein (RFC), thus addressing genetic variability in
multiple key proteins in this biological pathway. There is
strong evidence for the functional effect of MTHFR 677C>T
and TSER variant genotypes (14, 38-41), with some, yet less
well defined, evidence for the in vivo functional relevance of
MTR, RFC, and the TS 3V-UTR variant (16-18, 20-23, 42). Our
evaluations of colon cancer risk confirm this assessment, in
that there were no significant alterations in risk for MTR,
RFC, and TS polymorphisms, with the exception of a risk
reduction associated with the TSER variants among men. The
ORs for TSER are comparable with those from a previous

report by Chen et al. (43) among male physicians (OR, 0.9;
95% CI, 0.6-1.3 for the 2rpt/3rpt genotype and OR, 0.6; 95%
CI, 0.4-0.98 for the 2rpt/2rpt genotype). A statistically
significant trend towards reduced risk with the variant TSER
alleles was observed both here and in that population (43).
the variant TSER 2rpt/2rpt
These results indicate that
genotype reduces risk of colon or colorectal cancer among
men to a degree comparable with that of the MTHFR 677TT
genotype (44). As risk reductions for TSER variants were only
seen among women who are on postmenopausal hormones
but not among women overall, estrogen status may play a
role.

Further complexity is added as a result of the presence of
a second functionally relevant polymorphism in TS (15, 16).
We evaluated the combined effects of these genotypes as well
as haplotypes to discern possible risk patterns. The combined
TS wild type/wild type genotype constitutes only 8.3% of our
population. When compared with this wild type/wild type
reference group of putatively highest TS expression and TS
mRNA stability, the variant TSER genotypes were associated
with statistically significantly reduced risk among women (OR,
0.6; 95% CI, 0.4-0.9) yet not among men. Our sample sizes for
these sex-specific associations were limited, and results should
be followed up in large study populations that have the ability
to investigate combined genotypes as well as sex-specific ORs.

The presence of two common functional variants within TS
suggests that it is essential to take both of these into account
simultaneously.

The MTR polymorphism is less common (allele frequency =
0.20) and has been investigated in three epidemiologic studies,
including a large Norwegian cohort (7, 25, 45). Similar to our
findings, Le Marchand et al. (45) and Chen et al. (7) did not
report any associations between this variant and colon cancer
risk, whereas Ulvik et al. (25) observed a significantly reduced
risk among those with a GG genotype compared with wild-
type AA (OR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.47-0.90). We observed reduced
risks among men (OR, 0.7), but the 95% CI included 1.0. As
only about 5% of the population have the homozygous variant
genotype, very large studies are needed to quantify the
strength of this association.

For gene-gene interactions, only combinations with the
MTHFR polymorphisms showed interesting patterns. This is
not surprising, because MTHFR is a key regulatory enzyme in
folate-mediated one-carbon metabolism, the activity of which
determines the distribution of
folate metabolites toward
nucleotide synthesis or methylation reactions. There is strong
evidence that the MTHFR 677C>T variant alters the balance of
metabolites within the pathway (39, 46). In combined analyses
of TS and MTHFR polymorphisms, we observed that men
carrying at least one variant TS allele (either TSER 2rpt or
TS 1494del) in addition to the MTHFR 677TT genotype were
at relatively lowest risk compared with all other groups (both
OR, 0.6; 95% CI, 0.4-0.9). This confirms our previous
observation in colorectal adenoma, where individuals with
low TS expression and low MTHFR activity genotypes also
experienced the lowest adenoma risk (OR, 0.56; ref. 10). If this
statistical interaction reflects biological mechanisms, then we
may hypothesize that the observed pattern suggests that a
greater diversion of
folate metabolites (specifically 5,10-
methylene-tetrahydrofolate) toward purine synthesis is pro-
tective for the development of colorectal neoplasia. Recent
findings by Quinlivan et al. suggest that folate depletion
adversely affects purine synthesis in humans and a greater
relative rate of adenine synthesis among individuals with the
MTHFR TT genotype (46). Depurination is the most common
type of DNA damage with f10,000 depurinations/cell/d
(47, 48). Although efficiently repaired, apurinic sites are
present in DNA. We recognize that one other study did not
observe this risk pattern, but their sample size was limited to
270 cases, with consequent restricted power for studying gene-
gene interactions (43).

Our investigations of gene-diet interactions confirmed, to
some extent, associations we have previously observed with
respect to TSER, and folate intake that reduced TS expression
(TSER 2rpt/2rpt) is associated with a reduced risk in the
presence of a low folate intake (10). However, this pattern was
seen only among men and also has not been observed in the

Health Professionals study (43). Again, if that pattern reflects a
biological mechanism, it would point toward purine synthesis
as a key link between one-carbon metabolism and colorectal
neoplasia. We were unable to confirm previously observed
gene-diet interactions for MTR in colorectal adenoma (26) and
did not see a clear pattern for RFC-diet interactions. However,
the RFC is the transporter for naturally occurring folates (in the
form of 5-methyl-tetrahydrofolate) but plays a smaller role in
the transport of folic acid (49). Thus, in populations, such as
the one described here, where folate intake from supplements
in the form of folic acid comprises a substantial proportion of
the overall folate intake, genetic variability in the RFC may not
be as relevant for the overall supply of folate metabolites.
Unfortunately, no quantitative information on supplement use
was available for this population.

Lastly, we observed differences in risk patterns dependent
on the past use of postmenopausal hormones. Interactions
between folate metabolism and PMH use are not implausible,
as there are links between homocysteine concentrations and
PMH use (50-53), and methylation of the estrogen receptor is
an early event in colorectal carcinogenesis, which may less
frequently occur in the presence of PMH (27, 54). We have
previously reported on a significant difference in risk patterns
of PMH-associated risks by MTHFR genotypes (13). However,
these interactions need to be confirmed by others, because
sample sizes were in parts insufficient to yield stable estimates.
Although this study is quite comprehensive with respect to
investigations of genetic variability in one-carbon metabolism
and risk of colon cancer, there are three important limitations.
First, our investigations did not include other genetic poly-
morphisms in folate-metabolizing enzymes that may be of
possible relevance, such as methionine-synthase reductase
(MTRR) or serine-hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT). Thus
far, MTRR does not seem related to colon cancer risk (45), and
the functional relevance of the cSHMT polymorphisms is
unclear. The study presented here focused on candidate
polymorphisms in key enzymes with substantial evidence for
functional effect; we hope to expand our investigations to other
relevant candidate polymorphisms as they are reported.

Second, there is now strong evidence that a subset of
colorectal cancer cases arises as part of a CpG island methylator
phenotype (55, 56). Information on CpG island methylator
phenotype status should be taken into account in future studies
investigating links between genetic variability in folate metab-
olism and risk of colorectal cancer.

A final

limitation is our current

inability to integrate
knowledge of biochemical relationships within the pathway
into the statistical analysis. Although an approach that uses
stratification for gene-nutrient or gene-gene interactions is
valuable, in that it allows for an empirical investigation of the
associations, it is also limited in that statistical power for
higher-order interactions is lacking, even within this large

study population. Because folate metabolism consists of
several interconnected cycles (see Fig. 1), such interactions
are to be expected. Our approach toward solving this problem
is to use, in the future, results from a mathematical model of
one-carbon biochemistry for investigations of multiple genetic
variants on selected biomarkers. Although this model is still
under development, preliminary results show that it replicates
the biochemical relationships in the folate cycle and methio-
nine cycle with reasonable accuracy (57, 58). Furthermore, our
group and others are developing methods to address this
key problem for molecular epidemiologic studies (59). Thus,
we hope that in the future, we will be able to achieve closer
integration of the biochemistry and statistical analysis. Because
there is strong evidence that disturbances in this biochemical
pathway can modify risk of several types of malignancies
(60-63), birth outcomes (64-66), and possibly cardiovascular
disease (67) and autism (68), a more thorough understanding
of the interplay of multiple genetic polymorphisms under
specific dietary conditions and their combined effect on bio-
markers and disease end points will be highly relevant.

Background: Dietary carbohydrates vary in their ability to raise blood glucose and insulin levels, which, in
turn, influence levels of sex hormones and insulin-like growth factors. We analyzed the effect of type and
amount of carbohydrates on ovarian cancer risk, using the glycemic index (GI) and the glycemic load (GL)
measurement in a large case–control study conducted in Italy.
Materials and methods: Cases  included  1031  women  with  incident,  histologically  confirmed  epithelial
ovarian  cancer,  from  four  Italian  regions.  Controls  included  2411  women  admitted  to  the  same  hospital
networks for acute, non-neoplastic conditions. Average daily GI and GL were calculated from a validated
food frequency questionnaire. Odds ratios (OR) and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) were
computed using multiple logistic regression.
Results: Ovarian cancer was directly associated with dietary GI (OR for highest versus lowest quartile = 1.7,
95%  CI  1.3–2.1) and  GL (OR  = 1.7,  95%  CI 1.3–2.1). The  associations were observed in  pre- and  post-
menopausal women, and they remained consistent across strata of major covariates identified.
Conclusions: This study supports the hypothesis of a direct association between GI and GL and ovarian
cancer  risk  and,  consequently,  of  a  possible  role  of  hyperinsulinemia/insulin  resistance  in  ovarian  cancer
development.
Key words: carbohydrate, case–control study, glycemic load, ovarian cancer

Introduction
Ovarian  cancer  is  directly  related  to  nulliparity,  and  inversely
related to oral contraceptive use, but little is known of its poten-
tial dietary correlates [1]. It has been suggested that diet may have
a  potential  influence  on  ovarian  carcinogenesis,  and  several
case–control studies have reported a beneficial effect on the risk
of ovarian cancer of a diet rich in vegetables [2, 3]. A few case–
control  studies  showed  that  women  with  cancer  of  the  ovary
reported more frequent meat consumption [4, 5], and others sug-
gested that a diet rich in eggs may also increase the risk of ovarian
cancer [2, 6]. Fish, on the other hand, seemed to exert a protective
effect [5, 6].

With reference to specific nutrients, descriptive epidemiology
and  ecological  studies  have  reported  positive  relationships
between fat, protein and total calory intake, and ovarian cancer

risk [7]. Data from analytical, mainly case–control studies sup-
ported the hypothesis of a possible increased risk in relation to
various types of fat [2, 6]. Carbohydrates have also been shown to
increase the risk of epithelial ovarian cancer [8].

Different  carbohydrates,  however,  affect  blood  glucose  and
insulin levels to varying degrees depending on the nature of the
carbohydrate and the type and extent of food processing [9]. On
this basis they have been ranked using the glycemic index (GI)
and  glycemic  load  (GL).  Foods  with  high  GI  tend  to  increase
glucose and insulin levels to a greater extent than low GI foods
[9]. In turn, it has been proposed that insulin may be directly or
indirectly  involved  in  the  carcinogenic  process  by  modulating
hormonal levels such as sex hormones and insulin-like growth
factors (IGF) [10]. High-GL diets have been directly associated
with risk of various Western chronic conditions, including dia-
betes [11], coronary heart disease [12], colorectal [13] and breast
[14]  cancer,  and  high  insulin  levels  may  be  one  of  the  mech-
anisms of action of risk factors shared by these diseases [15].

We  thus  evaluated  the  possible  differential  effects  of carbo-
hydrate-rich foods on epithelial ovarian cancer risk by means of
the GI and GL measurements in a large case–control study.

Materials and methods

A multicenter case–control study of ovarian cancer was conducted between
January 1992 and September 1999 in four Italian regions: Greater Milan, the
provinces of Pordenone, Padua and Gorizia (north-eastern Italy); the province
of Latina (central Italy); and the urban area of Naples (southern Italy).

Cases included women with incident, histologically confirmed epithelial
ovarian cancer diagnosed within 1 year prior to interview and with no previ-
ous diagnosis of cancer. Overall, 1031 women aged 18–79 years (median age
56 years) were included. Controls included patients with no history of cancer
who were admitted to hospitals serving the same areas as those where cases
had  been  identified.  Eligible  diagnoses  were  acute,  non-neoplastic,  non-
gynecological conditions, unrelated to hormonal or digestive tract diseases,
or  associated  with  long-term  modifications  of  diet.  They  included  2411
women, aged 17–79 years (median age 57 years), belonging to the following
diagnostic  categories:  trauma,  mostly  fractures  and  sprains  (26%);  other
orthopedic disorders, such as low back pain and disc disorders (28%); acute
surgical conditions (15%); and other illnesses, such as eye, ear, nose, skin and
dental conditions (31%). Cases were frequency matched to controls accord-
ing to quinquennium of age and area of residence. Approximately 4% of cases
and controls approached for interview during their hospital stay refused to
participate.

The same structured questionnaire and coding manual were used in each
center, and all interviewers were centrally trained and routinely supervised.
The  checking  of  data  for  consistency  and  reliability  was  also  conducted
centrally.  The  questionnaire  included  information  on  sociodemographic
characteristics, such as education and occupation, lifelong smoking habits,
physical  activity  at  various  ages,  anthropometric  measures,  a  problem-
oriented  personal  medical  history,  family  history  of  selected  cancers,
menstrual  and  reproductive  history,  history  of  use  of  oral  contraceptives,
hormone replacement treatment, and female hormone-containing drugs for
other indications. Dietary habits were investigated through an interviewer-
administered  food  frequency  questionnaire  (FFQ)  that  included  78  items.
This questionnaire was used to assess the subjects’ habitual diet during the
2  years  prior  to  cancer  diagnosis  or  hospital  admission  (for  controls),  and
included questions on the average weekly frequency of consumption of foods
or food groups, as well as complex recipes. Satisfactory reproducibility [16]
and validity [17] of the FFQ have been reported. Details on methodology used
have  been  described  elsewhere  [13,  14].  To  compute  energy  and  nutrient
intake,  an  Italian  food-composition  database  was  used.  For  each  food,  we
expressed GI as a percentage of the glycemic response elicited using ‘white
bread’ as a standard food. We then calculated daily average GI by summing
the products of the carbohydrate content per serving for each food or recipe,
multiplied by the average number of servings of that food per week, multi-
plied  by  its  GI,  all  divided  by  the  total  amount  of  available  carbohydrate
weekly  intake.  This  represents  the  ‘quality  of  the  carbohydrates’,  namely
slow versus fast absorbable carbohydrates. A score for the daily average GL
was computed as the GI, but without dividing by the total amount of carbo-
hydrates. For these calculations we used the carbohydrate content of 50 foods
or  recipes,  since  28  foods  or  recipes,  chiefly  cheese,  meat  and fish-based,
contained a negligible amount of carbohydrate. With respect to GI values, we
chiefly used international tables. In order to take into account Italian cooking
habits (e.g. pasta ‘al dente’), Italian sources were used for a few local recipes.
Food items for which a GI had not been determined were assigned the GI of
the nearest comparable food (e.g. tangerines were assigned the same GI as
oranges).

Odds ratios (ORs) and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) for
quartiles of GI and GL intake were computed using unconditional multiple
logistic regression models [18]. The regression equations included terms for
quinquennia of age, study center, years of education, occupational physical
activity, history of diabetes, oral contraceptive use, parity, menopausal status,

79

number  of  daily  meals,  intakes  of  fiber,  alcohol  and  total  energy  intake.
Adjustment for energy was made using the residuals method. The modifying
effect of various covariates was evaluated comparing the differences between
the –2 log likelihood of the model with and without interaction terms, and
referring it to the chi square distribution with degrees of freedom equal to the
number of interaction terms minus one.

Results

Table 1 gives the distribution of ovarian cancer cases and control
subjects according to age, education, menopausal status and other
potential confounding factors. Cases were better educated than
controls, had a lower parity, frequently reported a family history
of ovarian and/or breast cancer, and a lower occupational phys-
ical activity.

GI  was  positively  correlated  with  GL  (Pearson  correlation
coefficient, r = 0.53), intake of bread (r = 0.59), cereals (r = 0.56),
cakes and sweets (r = 0.33), sugar (r = 0.26), available carbo-
hydrates  (r  =  0.37),  cereal  fibre  (r  =  0.42),  and  negatively
correlated  with  fruit  (r  =  –0.19)  and  vegetables  (r  =  –0.11).
Correlations  of  GI  with  other  dietary  and  non-dietary  factors
were weak (i.e. |r| < 0.10).

Table 2 shows the ORs of epithelial ovarian cancer according
to the quartiles of GI and GL, and total carbohydrate intake by
menopausal status. Dietary GI and GL were directly associated
with  ovarian  cancer  risk,  and  the  ORs,  for  the  highest  versus
the  lowest  quartile,  were  1.7  (95%  CI  1.3–2.1)  and  1.7  (95%
CI 1.3–2.1), respectively. However, ORs by quartile of GI and
GL did not show linear trends, but were already elevated in the
second  quartile  and  tended  to  plateau  thereafter.  Associations,
particularly for GI, were appreciably stronger in postmenopausal
compared with premenopausal women, although no significant
heterogeneity  emerged.  Total  carbohydrate  intake  was  also
associated with ovarian cancer (OR = 1.8, in the highest quartile,
95% CI 1.3–2.4) in postmenopausal women (Table 2).

Table  3  shows  the  relationship  between  GI  and  epithelial
ovarian  cancer  in  different  strata  of  known  or  suspected  risk
factors for ovarian cancer. No substantial effect modification was
apparent in strata of: family history of ovarian or breast cancer;
oral contraceptive use; and parity.

The relationship between GI and epithelial ovarian cancer risk
was also analyzed in separate strata of history of diabetes, body
mass index (BMI), BMI increase from age 30, waist to hip (W/H)
ratio, occupational physical activity and alcohol intake (Table 4).
There was no consistent pattern of risk among diabetic subjects
or in different strata of BMI, BMI increase from age 30, and W/H
ratio. There was, however, a significant modifying effect of alco-
hol, with no consistent association with GI in alcohol abstainers.
The association with GI was stronger in women reporting higher
physical activity.

Although risk factors, including dietary factors, may differ in
their  relationship  to  specific  histological  subtypes  of  ovarian
cancer [19], no relevant difference emerged when we replicated
the  analyses  for  GI  and  GL  in  invasive  serous  ovarian  cancer
only. Other histological subtypes represented <10% of cases in
our data set.

Discussion

The present study shows direct associations between dietary GI
and GL and epithelial ovarian cancer risk. An elevated risk was
found in the second quartile of GI and GL, but did not show a
further increase in the third and fourth (highest) quartile. These
associations were consistent across different strata of known or
potential risk factors for ovarian cancer. However, the relation-
ship between GI and epithelial ovarian cancer in our study was
somewhat  stronger  in  post-  compared  with  premenopausal
women, and in women without a family history and in parae.

Diets with high GI or GL are associated with a high consump-
tion of refined carbohydrates, which are quickly absorbed and are
capable of elevating blood glucose and insulin level to a greater

extent  than  slowly  absorbed  ones,  such  as  pulses  and  whole
grains, which are low GI foods [20]. The main sources of carbo-
hydrates in the Italian population are bread, a high GI food, and
pasta, a medium-low GI food, representing 20.5% and 13.4% of
total carbohydrate intake, respectively [13].

High insulin levels have been suggested as a potential unifying
mechanism  for  the  risk  of  several  Western  chronic  diseases
related to high intakes of energy, fat, refined carbohydrates, and
low physical activity and obesity [15]. Central obesity (i.e. high
W/H ratio) was associated with ovarian cancer risk in this study
[21]. Diabetes, which is characterized by high insulin levels in its
early stages,  was considered  as a possible correlate of ovarian
cancer risk. However, in line with other studies [22, 23] a history
of diabetes was not found to consistently affect ovarian cancer

risk in the present study. This could, however, have resulted from
the small absolute number of diabetic subjects (∼4%).

Insulin  is  a  growth  factor  for  cancer  cells,  and  it  has  been
shown to act as a cancer promoter in in vitro and in animal studies
[15, 24]. Insulin also has affinity for IGF receptors, particularly
the IGF-1 receptor, which has strong mitogenic effects on normal
and  neoplastic  cells,  including  ovarian  carcinoma  cell  lines,
where it has been found at higher levels than in non-malignant
cells [25]. Epidemiological evidence suggests a promoting effect
of hyperinsulinemia [15] and of IGF-1 in carcinogenesis [25].

Insulin and IGF-1 are also powerful negative regulators of sex
hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) synthesis in vitro, and they
may stimulate ovarian cancer proliferation through a hormonal
pathway  [26].  An  interaction  between  insulin,  IGFs  and  sex
hormones has also been suggested for breast cancer [27].

As in most case–control studies, recall and selection biases are
possible [18]. However, awareness about any dietary hypotheses,
and particularly those related to GI and GL, for ovarian cancer was
limited in the Italian population when the study was conducted.
While  it  is  conceivable  that  dietary  habits  of  hospital  controls
may  have  differed  from  those  of  the  general  population,  great
attention was paid in this study to minimize bias by excluding
control  subjects  admitted  for  conditions  that  might  have  been
associated with special dietary habits. Of greater concern is the
early  weight  loss  often  occurring  in  ovarian  cancer  patients,
which may have led cases to increase their energy and, hence,
carbohydrate  intake  [21].  We  had,  however,  information  on
weight loss during the year prior to cancer diagnosis or interview.
Stratification and adjustment for weight or recent weight loss did
not  modify  the  association  with  GI  and  GL.  Interviewing  all
subjects in a hospital setting may have allowed greater compar-
ability of  dietary history  between  cases  and  controls [28],  and
adjustment  for  total  energy  intake  should  have  controlled  for
potential dietary over- and under-reporting. Furthermore, parti-
cipation among eligible patients was practically complete and the
catchment areas for cases and controls were highly comparable.
GI estimates have some limitations. Some GI estimates have
been derived from small samples and their variability is unclear
[13]. Statistics on the average dietary GI and GL in the general
Italian population are not available, but intakes of bread and pasta
in the present study were similar to those reported in the Italian
population  [29].  In  addition,  it  would  be  important  to  confirm
the association between GI, GL and ovarian cancer in different
populations, since the genotype for insulin resistance may vary
between ethnic groups [30].

The major strength of this study is its uniquely large dataset,
which allowed reasonably precise risk estimates. Other strengths
include consistency of findings, when major categories of con-
trols were used separately, and its reliance on a validated food
frequency questionnaire [16, 17].

In conclusion, this study found associations between dietary
GI, GL and ovarian cancer risk, thus supporting a possible role of
insulin  and  insulin-related  factors  in  ovarian  carcinogenesis.
Similar associations were observed for colorectal [13] and breast
[14]  cancer,  indicating  the  potential  role  of  these  factors  on
several common neoplasms.

Summary

Background: Insulin and insulin-like growth factors can
stimulate proliferation of colorectal cells. High intake of re-
¢ned carbohydrates and markers of insulin resistance are
associated with colorectal cancer. To test the insulin/colon
cancer hypothesis, we determined whether the dietary glyce-
mic index and the glycemic load are associated with colorectal
cancer risk.

Design: A case-control study on colorectal cancer con-
ducted in Italy. Cases included 1125 men and 828 women with
histologically con¢rmed incident cancer of the colon or rectum.
Controls were 2073 men and 2081 women hospitalized for
acute conditions. We calculated average daily dietary glycemic
index and glycemic load, and ¢ber intake from a validated
food frequency questionnaire.

Results: Direct associations with colorectal cancer risk
emerged for glycemic index (odds ratio (OR) in highest vs.
lowest quintile = 1.7; 95% con¢dence interval (CI): 1.4^2.0)
and glycemic load (OR = 1.8; 95% CI: 1.5^2.2), after allowance
for sociodemographic factors, physical activity, number of daily
meals, and intakes of ¢ber, alcohol and energy. ORs were more
elevated for cancer of the colon than rectum. Overweight and
low intake of ¢ber from vegetables and fruit appeared to
amplify the adverse consequences of high glycemic load.

Conclusions: The positive associations of glycemic index
and load with colorectal cancer suggest a detrimental role of
re¢ned carbohydrates in the etiology of the disease.

Key words: colon cancer, ¢ber, glycemic load, rectal cancer

Introduction

Carbohydrate foods consumed in isoglucidic amounts
produce di¡erent glycemic and insulinemic responses
depending upon the nature of the food (e.g., ratio of
amylose to amylopectin, amount and type of ¢ber,
particle size of starch granules) and type and extent of
food processing (e.g., extrusion, £aking, grinding, and
cooking) [1].

A role of diets with a high glycemic response and
consequent hyperinsulinemia in colorectal carcinogene-
sis has been postulated [2, 3]. Several ¢ndings from an
Italian case-control study support this hypothesis. Direct
associations were found between colorectal cancer and
intake of re¢ned carbohydrates and energy [4], number
of daily meals [5], body mass index (BMI) in men and,
among women, central adiposity [6]. Conversely, inverse
associations emerged for intake of vegetables, pulses,
and ¢sh [7], ¢bre [8], unsaturated-to-saturated fat ratio
[4], and level of physical activity [9].

In order to test the insulin/colon cancer hypothesis,
we decided to evaluate the dietary carbohydrate compo-
nent using the glycemic index (GI), an indicator of

carbohydrate foods’ ability to raise blood glucose levels,
and the glycemic load score (GL), as a combination of
quality as well as quantity of carbohydrates consumed,
and thus a measure of dietary insulin demand.

Patients and methods

A case-control study of cancer of the colon and rectum was conducted
between January 1992 and June 1996 in six Italian areas: the provinces
of Pordenone and Gorizia in North-eastern Italy; the urban areas of
Milan and Genoa and the provinces of Forl|' , in the North; and Latina
and the urban area of Naples in the South [7].

Cases had histologically con¢rmed colorectal cancer diagnosed no
longer than one year prior to the interview (median 1 month) and with
no previous diagnoses of cancer at other sites. Overall, 1225 subjects
with cancer of the colon (688 men and 537 women, median age 62,
range 19^74 years) and 728 with cancer of the rectum and rectosigmoid
junction (437 men and 291 women, median age 62, range 23^74 years)
were included.

Controls were in-patients with no history of cancer,

in major
teaching and general hospitals in the same areas where cases lived,
and identi¢ed for acute, non-neoplastic, non-gynecological conditions,
unrelated to hormonal or digestive tract diseases. All chronic condi-
tions which may lead to lifestyle modi¢cations (e.g., diabetes mellitus,
cardiovascular diseases, etc.) were not eligible causes of hospital

admission. Conversely, comorbidity from the above conditions did not
represent an exclusion criterion. The control group included 2073 men
and 2081 women aged 19^74 years (median age 58) belonging to the
following diagnostic categories: trauma, mostly fractures and sprains
(27%); other orthopedic disorders, such as low back and disc disorders
(24%); acute surgical conditions (18%); eye diseases (24%); and other
miscellaneous diseases, such as ear, nose, throat, skin and dental
conditions (7%). About 4% of cases and controls approached during
their hospital stay refused to be interviewed.

The same structured questionnaire and coding manual were used
in each center, and all interviewers were centrally trained and routinely
supervised. The questionnaire included information on socio-demo-
graphic characteristics, such as education and occupation, lifetime
smoking and alcohol-drinking habits, physical activity, anthropomet-
ric measures at various ages, a problem-oriented personal medical
history and family history of cancer. Body mass index (BMI) was
computed as weight in kilograms divided by height in square meters.
In order to compute waist-to-hip (W : H) ratio, the interviewer measured
the circumference of waist (2 cm above the umbilicus) and hip (max-
imal protrusion). On account of medical or logistic problems, waist
and/or hip circumferences were not measured in 25% of colorectal
cancer cases and 19% of control subjects [6].

An interviewer-administered food-frequency questionnaire (FFQ)
including total energy.
was used to assess subjects’ habitual diet,
Average weekly frequency of consumption of foods or food groups, as
well as complex recipes during the two years prior to cancer diagnosis
or hospital admission (for controls) was elicited. The FFQ also
included 15 questions aimed at assessing individual fat intake pattern
and meal frequency. Satisfactory reproducibility [10, 11] and validity
[12] of the FFQ have been reported. To compute energy and nutrient
intake, an Italian food-composition data base was used [13]. Fiber,
de¢ned as non starch polysaccharides plus lignin, was divided accord-
ing to the type of food from which it originated (i.e., vegetables and
fruit or cereals) [14^16].

The GI is a qualitative assessment of foods based on the incremen-
tal glucose response and insulin demand they produce for a given
amount of carbohydrates. We expressed GI as a percent of the glycemic
response elicited by white bread as a standard food. For each case and
control subject, we calculated daily average GI by summing the
products of the carbohydrate content per serving for each food or
recipe, times the average number of servings of that food per week,
times its GI, all divided by the total amount of available carbohydrate
weekly intake [17, 18]. A score for the daily average GL was computed
as the GI, but without dividing by the total amount of carbohydrates.
For these calculations we used the carbohydrate content of 50 foods
or recipes since 28 foods or recipes, chie£y meat- and ¢sh-based ones
and cheese, contained a negligible amount of carbohydrates [13]. With

respect to GI values we chie£y used international tables [18]. In order
to take into account Italian cooking habits (e.g., pasta ‘al dente’),
Italian sources were used for a few local recipes [19]. Food items for
which a GI had not been determined were assigned the GI of the
nearest comparable food (e.g., tangerines were assigned the GI of
oranges). As an example, Table 1 shows GIs estimated for a few
common foods and recipes.

Odds ratios (ORs) and the corresponding 95% con¢dence interval
for quintiles of GI and GL were derived using unconditional multiple
logistic regression models [20]. The regression equations included
terms for age, sex, study center, years of education, occupational
physical activity, number of daily meals, and intakes of ¢ber, alcohol
and energy. Adjustment for energy was made using the residuals
method [21]. GI and GL were also introduced as continuous variables,
and the unit of measurement were 5 and 50, respectively.

Results

After allowance for age, sex, and center, patients with
cancer of the colon, but not rectum, were signi¢cantly
more educated and reported lower levels of physical
activity than controls (Table 2).

GI was positively correlated to GL (Pearson correla-
tion coe⁄cient, r = 0.59), intake of bread (r = 0.66),
cakes and sweets (r = 0.28), table sugar (r = 0.23), and
energy (r = 0.27), but negatively correlated to intake of
fruit (r = -0.19) and vegetables (r = ”0.12). Correlation
of GI with other dietary and non-dietary factors, in-
cluding intake of di¡erent types of fat, alcoholic bever-
ages, daily number of meals, BMI,
level of physical
activity, and smoking habits were weak (i.e., r 5 0.10).

Colorectal cancer risk increased with an increase in
dietary GI (OR for highest versus lowest quintile: 1.7;
95% CI: 1.4^2.0) and GL (OR = 1.8; 95% CI: 1.5^2.2)
(Table 3). The ORs were somewhat higher for colon
cancer (1.9 for GI and 1.9 for GL in the highest quintile)
than rectal cancer (1.4 and 1.5, respectively).

Findings were similar in separate strata of age, but
the association for the combination of colorectal cancer
was somewhat stronger among women (OR in highest
quintile = 2.0 for GI and 2.6 for GL) than among men
(ORs 1.5 for either GI and GL). This di¡erence was
probably accounted for by a greater proportion of sub-
jects with colon cancer in the female than in the male
sex. No material interaction or e¡ect modi¢cation was
observed between GI or GL and level of physical activity,
alcohol drinking and unsaturated-to-saturated fatty acid
ratio. One hundred sixteen (6%) cases and one hundred
eighty-¢ve (4%) control subjects reported a history of
non-insulin dependent diabetes. OR in the highest in-
take quintile of GI and GL were, respectively, 2.1 and 2.4
among diabetic individuals and 1.7 and 1.8 among non-
diabetic individuals.

We examined the joint e¡ect of GL and di¡erent ¢ber
intake by cross-classifying patients with both variables
(Figure 1a and b). GL was directly associated with colo-
rectal cancer risk in each stratum of ¢ber from vegetables
and fruit (median intake 11.9 g per day). Similarly, low
¢ber intakes showed elevated ORs in each stratum of
dietary GL (Figure 1a). The OR for the combination of
the highest tertile of GL and the lowest tertile of ¢ber

from vegetables and fruit compared with the opposite
extreme was 1.9 (95% CI: 1.5^2.4). GL and ¢ber from
cereals (median intake 5.7 g per day) produced a di¡er-
ent picture (Figure 1b). The OR for the combination of
the highest tertile of GL and the lowest one of cereal
¢ber was 0.8 (95% CI: 0.5^1.5), whereas for the highest
tertile of GL and the highest of cereal ¢ber was 1.5 (95%
CI: 1.0^2.1). In fact GL and ¢ber from cereals were
strongly correlated (r = 0.81).

We also assessed the combined in£uence of GL and
the best indicators of visceral adipose tissue in our study,
i.e.,W : H ratio in women and BMI in men (Table 4). The
OR was 2.8 (95% CI: 1.9^4.1) in the highest GL tertile in
combination with the highest tertile of W : H ratio in
women. Among men, the OR for the combination of the
highest tertile of BMI and the highest GL tertile was 1.8
(95% CI: 1.3^2.7).

Discussion

High dietary GI and GL have been associated with
increased risk of non-insulin dependent diabetes [22,23]
and coronary heart disease [24], but the in£uence of GI
and GL on colorectal cancer risk has been little studied
[25]. Our present ¢ndings show that a diet that increases
glycemic response is involved in the etiology of cancers
of the colon-rectum, particularly of those which arise
from the colon. The associations with GI and GL were
independent from the presence of diabetes. Low intake

of ¢ber from vegetables and fruit and elevated BMI or
W : H ratio appeared to contribute in enhancing colo-
rectal cancer risk when the diet was high in GL.

The positive associations we observed between GI
and GL and colorectal cancer were among the strongest
reported so far for any dietary factor [7, 25], and were
consistent in di¡erent strata of age, sex, and various risk
covariates. The strong risk increase among individuals
on a high-GL-low-¢ber diet is in agreement with the
property of ¢ber to £atten the glucose-response and has
also been observed in individuals with non-insulin de-
pendent diabetes [22, 23]. Fiber from vegetables and
fruit, which accounted for 2/3 of ¢ber intake, seemed to
exert a bene¢cial e¡ect on colorectal cancer risk and,
possibly, to mitigate the impact of high dietary GL. It is
possible that ¢ber from cereals did not appear to be
protective in our [8] as well as in other study populations
[26] because it was derived chie£y from highly re¢ned
cereal products [27]. Data on the relationship between
di¡erent types of ¢ber and glycemic response and insulin
demand depend on the nature of ¢ber and its relation to
the nutrients contained in the food [28]. When taken out
of their botanical structure, isolated cereal ¢ber is not
seen to reduce the rate of carbohydrate absorption while
viscous ¢ber (i.e., guar) has been shown to decrease the
rate of glucose absorption [29].

Whereas consumption of sugar and cakes is relatively
low, Italy shows the highest consumption of carbo-
hydrates from re¢ned cereals among a¥uent countries
[30], up to more than 300 g/day in one ¢fth of this study
population. Interestingly, the highest intake quintile of
white bread, whose GI is 100, was associated with an
energy-adjusted OR of 1.6 (95% CI: 1.3^1.9) whereas the
highest intake quintile of pasta, whose GI is only ap-
proximately 60, showed an OR of 1.2 (95% CI: 1.0^1.5).
Visceral adipose tissue has been associated with in-
creased insulin resistance and colorectal cancer risk [31].

Men have more visceral adipose tissue than women.
Thus, BMI was a good surrogate of visceral adipose tissue
in the male sex while W : H ratio had to be considered
among women [6]. Assessment of BMI and W : H ratio
in colorectal cancer patients is hampered by weight loss
in the proximity of cancer diagnosis. We had, however,
information on BMI changes over time, and we were
able to allow for recent weight loss [6].

In addition to dietary ¢ndings, several lines of evidence
suggest a role of insulin in colorectal carcinogenesis.
Non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus is associated
with increased risk of colorectal cancer [32, 33]. Insulin
is considered to be a growth factor and has been shown
to increase insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I, which is
involved in long-term regulation of energy metabolism
[2]. Insulin and IGF receptors have been found in both
normal and malignant cells of colonic mucosa, and can
stimulate proliferation of human colorectal cells [2, 34].
Tall individuals [35] and those with acromegaly, who
have elevated levels of growth hormone and IGF-I [36],
have an increased incidence of colorectal cancer. Circu-
lating levels of IGF-I and II and IGF binding protein
(IGF BP)-III, which modulate access of IGF-I to IGF-
receptors, were related to subsequent colorectal cancer
risk [37, 38].

We used a validated questionnaire [10, 12] and had
access to a large number of colorectal cancer patients
and control subjects who, in the vast majority, agreed to
participate in the study. The control group included a
broad range of acute conditions unrelated to diet modi¢-
cations. Reported associations with GI and GL were not
restricted to any major nosological category of control,
and held true when cases and controls with a history of
diabetes were excluded. Allowance was possible for a
number of potential confounding factors,
including
number of daily meals, energy and alcohol intake, and
physical activity. Weaknesses of the present ¢ndings
include, however, the limitations of current GI estimates.
Many of them have been derived from small samples
and variations of estimates in mixed-meal situations are
unclear [17,18]. Notwithstanding, the present ¢ndings
lend indirect support to the hypothesis that increased
glycemic response and insulin resistance are associated
with colorectal cancer, most notably with that of the
colon.

Abstract

The functional signiﬁcance of two unlinked human vitamin D receptor (hVDR) gene polymorphisms was evaluated in twenty
human ﬁbroblast cell lines. Genotypes at both a Fok I restriction site (F/f ) in exon II and a singlet (A) repeat in exon IX (L/S)
were determined, and relative transcription activities of endogenous hVDR proteins were measured using a transfected,
1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3-responsive reporter gene. Observed activities ranged from 2–100-fold induction by hormone, with
higher activity being displayed by the F and the L biallelic forms. Only when genotypes at both sites were considered
simultaneously did statistically signiﬁcant differences emerge. Moreover, the correlation between hVDR activity and genotype
segregated further into clearly deﬁned high and low activity groups with similar genotypic distributions. These results not only
demonstrate functional relevance for both the F/f and L/S common polymorphisms in hVDR, but also provide novel evidence
for a third genetic variable impacting receptor potency. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction

The biological actions of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3
[1,25(OH)2D3] are mediated largely, if not entirely, by
the vitamin D receptor (VDR), a member of the super-
family of nuclear hormone receptors (Whitﬁeld et al.,
1999). This protein is found in tissues known to play a
role in calcium homeostasis, and also in numerous
other tissues, where it appears to regulate a variety of
processes, including cell proliferation and differentia-
tion (Haussler et al., 1998). The signiﬁcance of the
nuclear VDR in calcium homeostasis, as well as in
certain differentiation and proliferation processes in
skin and uterus, has been conﬁrmed by gene knockout
studies in mice (Li et al., 1998; Kato et al., 1999).

A simpliﬁed diagram that illustrates how nuclear
hVDR mediates
transcriptional activation by the
1,25(OH)2D3 hormone is shown in Fig. 1A. The key
features of this model are: (i) liganding of nuclear VDR

by 1,25(OH)2D3; (ii) recruitment by 1,25(OH)2D3-VDR
of its retinoid X receptor (RXR) heteropartner that, in
turn, facilitates high-afﬁnity interaction of the dimeric
complex with vitamin D responsive elements (VDREs)
upstream of target genes; (iii) attraction by VDR of
basal transcription factor IIB (TFIIB), the rate-limiting
component of the transcription preinitiation complex;
and (iv) recruitment by the heterodimer of a number of
transcription coactivators, some with histone acetyl
transferase (HAT) activity to modify nucleosome/chro-
matin organization, such as SRC-1 (Gill et al., 1998),
and others like the DRIPs (Rachez et al., 1999) that
target the VDR supercomplex to the TATA-box/TBP
and RNA polymerase II transcription initiation ma-
chinery. The net result of this 1,25(OH)2D3-triggered
response is the regulation of genes coding for proteins
that carry out intestinal calcium absorption, bone re-
modeling, cell differentiation, etc. (Jurutka et al., 2001).
A modular diagram of the functional domains within
the hVDR protein is presented in Fig. 1B. The details
of the hVDR subdomain arrangement (see ﬁgure leg-
end) basically follow the general pattern for the sub-

family of nuclear receptors that heterodimerize with
RXR, such as the all-trans retinoic acid receptors (RARs)
and the thyroid hormone receptors (TRs) (Whitﬁeld et
al., 1999). For the purposes of the present communica-
tion, the most relevant regions of hVDR are the hor-
mone-binding domain, encoded by exons VI–IX of the
human gene (see also Fig. 2), the DNA binding domain/
zinc ﬁngers, encoded by exons II–IV, and a set of
discontinuous transactivation domains,
including re-
gions at the N-terminus (for TFIIB docking) (Jurutka et
al., 2000), and in helices 3 and 12 (for coactivator
recruitment). Since transactivation is the ultimate bio-
chemical action of the liganded VDR and depends on all
of the other capabilities of the receptor (ligand binding,
nuclear localization, heterodimerization and VDRE/
DNA binding), the present study focuses on this parame-
ter of receptor activity in order to probe for functional
signiﬁcance of hVDR gene polymorphisms.

The chromosomal gene for VDR has been cloned
(Miyamoto et al., 1997), and several common genetic
variants have been described in humans, most of which
are identiﬁed by a biallelic variation in a restriction
endonuclease site (Fig. 2). Genetic variation in the 3%
region of the hVDR gene is observed in speciﬁc intronic
sites for Bsm I (Morrison et al., 1992) and Apa I (Faraco
et al., 1989), a silent Taq I site in exon IX (Morrison et
al., 1992), as well as in a singlet(A) repeat in the portion
of exon IX encoding the 3% UTR (Ingles et al., 1997a) (see
Fig. 2, right). All of these variations near the 3% end of
the gene are in linkage disequilibrium (Morrison et al.,
1992; Verbeek et al., 1997), although this linkage is
weaker in some ethnic groups such as African-Americans
(Ingles et al., 1997a). Interestingly, none of these poly-
morphisms affect the structure of the VDR protein itself,
although the singlet(A) repeat in the 3% UTR is expressed
in the mature mRNA for hVDR. Singlet(A) variants are
classiﬁed according to length by the number of consec-
utive A’s in the repeat, with ]17 A’s scored as ‘long’
(L), and 515 A’s considered ‘short’ (S).

Another polymorphic site has been found in exon II
near the center of the hVDR gene (Saijo et al., 1991). This
site, which is genetically unlinked to the above Bsm/Apa/
Taq/singlet(A) cluster, is unique among common hVDR
variants described so far, in that it results in an alteration
of the hVDR protein structure (Fig. 2, bottom center).
Presence of the Fok I site (designated f ) predicts that a
427-residue VDR protein will be produced beginning at
Met-1 (M1 according to the numbering scheme of Baker
et al. (1988), whereas absence of this site (denoted F)
dictates translation from Met-4 (M4), producing a
protein of 424 amino acids (Arai et al., 1997).

In an initial report (Morrison et al., 1994), allelic
variation in the chromosomal gene for the vitamin D
receptor was proposed to represent a major part of the
genetic predisposition for low bone mineral density
(BMD), and perhaps for osteoporosis and/or skeletal

Fig. 1. (A) Model for transcriptional activation by 1,25(OH)2D3 as
mediated by a heterodimer of VDR and RXR bound to VDREs
upstream of target genes in vitamin-D responsive cells. As the pri-
mary receptor, VDR is activated by 1,25(OH)2D3 binding, but the
RXR coreceptor apparently can remain unliganded. The receptor
heterodimer associates with direct repeat-type responsive elements
upstream of the target genes and the liganded heterocomplex at-
tracts various coactivators, some with histone acetylase (HAT) ac-
tivity. VDR itself recruits basal transcription factor IIB (TFIIB).
Finally,
the ensemble of protein-protein-DNA interactions pro-
motes transcriptional initiation of a battery of target genes, leading
to the pleiotrophic effects of the 1,25(OH)2D3 hormone (Haussler
et al., 1998). (B) Schematic illustration of functional domains in the
VDR protein. The DNA binding domain, with two zinc ﬁnger
motifs,
is located near the N-terminus and also contains residues
that promote nuclear localization of the receptor. The central and
C-terminal region of the receptor contain subdomains that mediate
ligand binding (Rochel et al., 2000). The heterodimerization (with
RXR) and transactivation functions of hVDR appear to be medi-
ated by widely separated regions of the receptor. Heterodimeriza-
tion is supported by heptad repeats in the helix 7–10 region
(Nakajima et al., 1994), an E1 domain (Whitﬁeld et al., 1995), as
well as residues in the T-box and ﬁrst zinc ﬁnger (Hsieh et al.,
1995). Transactivation regions include: (i) the extreme N-terminus,
which possesses a TFIIB docking site (Jurutka et al., 2000); (ii) a
centrally located domain corresponding to helix 3 in the rat TRa,
hRARg and hVDR ligand binding domain crystals (Renaud et al.,
1995; Wagner et al., 1995; Kraichely et al., 1999; Rochel et al.,
2000); and (iii) the extreme C-terminus, corresponding to helix 12
in the rat TRa, hRARg and hVDR crystals (Renaud et al., 1995;
Wagner et al., 1995; Jurutka et al., 1997; Rochel et al., 2000). ‘A’

important DNA-binding
amino acids (Hsieh et al., 1999). The residue 159–201 segment,
which is unconserved in VDRs, is encoded by a novel exon (V),
not seen in other nuclear receptors for which the gene structure is
known (Haussler et al., 1998).

Fig. 2. The human VDR gene, with key features relevant to polymorphic variation in VDR expression and activity. The ﬁfteen known exons are
depicted at the top (Miyamoto et al., 1997; Crofts et al., 1998). The 5% untranslated region of hVDR mRNAs is observed to be alternatively spliced
in all tested human tissues (Crofts et al., 1998). The predominant hVDR mRNA in tissues tested to date contains a 5% UTR consisting of exon
IA spliced to IC; several other less abundant spliced forms have been described, implying the existence of at least three promoters for the hVDR
gene, depicted by arrows above exons IF, IA and ID, respectively, (Crofts et al., 1998). Exons II and III encode the translation start site, a short
N-terminal domain, and the two zinc ﬁnger motifs of the DNA binding domain (one in each exon). The overlapping ligand-binding and strong
heterodimerization domains are encoded by exons VI–IX, with exon IX also containing the entire 3% UTR. At right are shown four linked
polymorphic sites in or somewhat 5% to exon IX. The present study focuses on the singlet(A) repeat, which lies about 1 kb upstream of the
polyadenylation site and exists in either a long (L=17–24 A’s) or a short (S=10–15 A’s) form (Ingles et al., 1997a). An additional site of interest
to the current study is the dimorphic translational start site (Saijo et al., 1991), the two forms of which (F or f, illustrated at bottom center) are
unlinked to the L/S variants (Gross et al., 1996).

fractures, although these associations have been dis-
puted by other studies [reviewed in (Wood and Fleet,
1998)]. More recently, correlations have been reported
between VDR allelic variants and risk of prostate can-
cer (Ingles et al., 1997b; Watanabe et al., 1999), breast
cancer (Ingles et al., 1997c; Ruggiero et al., 1998;
Curran et al., 1999), sporadic primary hyperparathy-
roidism (Correa et al., 1999), and sarcoidosis (Niimi et
al., 1999). However, conﬂicting reports have appeared
that minimize or even contradict these associations
(Cheng and Tsai, 1999; Correa et al., 1999). Likewise,
direct testing of hVDR alleles for activity has yielded
somewhat variable results, although, when a difference
is found, the b and F hVDR alleles appear to be more
active than the B or f alleles (see Section 4).

One caveat in most of the above-cited studies is that
correlations were sought between a single, speciﬁc poly-
morphism, or between the Bsm-Apa-Taq linkage group,
and the physiological parameter of interest. Very few
studies have attempted to control for hVDR genotype
at both the Bsm/Apa/Taq/singlet(A) cluster and the
Fok I site. In one example (Ferrari et al., 1998), a
correlation between Fok I alleles and BMD could not
be demonstrated, but ‘cross-genotyping’ with Bsm I
alleles revealed a potentially important positive associa-
tion in prepubertal girls between the ffBB hVDR geno-
type and low BMD (Ferrari et al., 1998).

Another caveat in the above cited studies is that a
direct inﬂuence of allelic variation on VDR expression
or activity was not demonstrated,
leaving open the
possibility that the observed correlation might be due

to linkage to another nearby site or even to a different
gene. In the only two extant studies in which the
potential relationship between genotype and activity of
the hVDR protein was evaluated (Verbeek et al., 1997;
Gross et al., 1998), no functional inﬂuence of speciﬁc
alleles was observed, but again, only a single polymor-
phic site was examined in isolation.

In the present communication, we report an evalua-
tion of a panel of twenty human ﬁbroblast lines. The
current protocol includes simultaneous consideration of
the hVDR genotypes at both the singlet(A) and the Fok
I loci, which are then correlated with activity of the
endogenous VDR in the corresponding cell line. From
these data, we conclude that (a) biallelic variants at the
Fok I and the singlet(A) sites, in combination, affect
transcriptional activation by the endogenous hVDR in
the tested human ﬁbroblasts; (b) the singlet(A) L allele
is more active than the S allele; and (c) a third, un-
known genetic variable appears to inﬂuence VDR
activity.

(Nichols Institute, San Juan Capistrano, CA). The
hVDR expression vector, pSG5-hVDR, expressing the
F/M4 isoform of hVDR, has been described earlier
(Hsieh et al., 1991). This construct was adapted for
expression of the f/M1 hVDR isoform by inserting the
appropriate DNA codons via in vitro site-directed mu-
tagenesis (Jurutka et al., 2000). For monitoring the
efﬁciency of transfection, a commercial plasmid ex-
pressing b-galactosidase (CMV-bgal) was obtained
from Promega Corp. (Madison, WI).

2.2. Cell lines

Cell lines DNF-BJ, DWF-CV and DWF-TW were
provided courtesy of C. Bloch at the Children’s Hospi-
tal, Denver, CO. Patients DWF-CV and DWF-TW are
reported to have features of William’s Syndrome. Other
cell lines were obtained from the American Type Cul-
ture Collection, Manassas, VA, with patients Ber Lin,
Be Sal and Ran Nor reported to have late-onset
osteoporosis.

cell

lines were

Human ﬁbroblast

cultured in
DMEM:Ham’s F12 medium supplemented with 10%
fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 U/ml penicillin and 100
mg/ml streptomycin. Cells were transfected by electro-
poration (see Fig. 3, top left). Brieﬂy, cells were col-
lected by trypsinization, pelleted at
low speed and

resuspended at 5×106 cells per ml in 1X HeBS buffer
(20 mM HEPES, pH 7.1, 137 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl,
0.7 mM Na2HPO4, 6 mM dextrose). Suspended cells
(0.8 ml) were then combined with 40 mg (CT4)4 TKGH
reporter plasmid, 10 mg of CMV-bgal plasmid, and 450
mg carrier DNA (pTZ18U plasmid), and adjusted to a
total volume of 1 ml in 1X HeBS buffer in a 0.4 cm
electrode gap electroporation cuvette. Each cuvette was
then subjected to electroporation in a Bio-Rad Gene
Pulser II apparatus (with capacitance extender attach-
ment) at settings of 200 V and 950 mF. After 10 min of
incubation at room temperature,
the electroporated
cells were suspended in culture medium and then di-
vided into six 60 mm culture dishes and incubated at
37°C for 72 h in the presence of 10− 8 M 1,25(OH)2D3
(three plates) or ethanol vehicle (also in triplicate
plates). The levels of growth hormone secreted into the
culture medium were
then assessed by radioim-
munoassay using a commercial kit (Nichols Institute)
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. To normalize
results for the efﬁciency of transfection in each plate,
b-galactosidase levels were assayed in cell
lysates
(freeze-thaw method) using reagents and instructions
from a commercial kit (Promega Corp.). These steps
are represented as a ﬂow chart in Fig. 3 (left).

For the experiment depicted in Fig. 7, ROS 2/3 cells
(8×105 cells per 60 mm dish) were transfected by
calcium phosphate coprecipitation as described earlier
(Jurutka et al., 2000) using 10 mg of a reporter plasmid
containing 1100 bp of the natural rat osteocalcin pro-
moter linked to the human growth hormone gene [de-

Fig. 3. Protocol for VDR genotype/phenotype analysis of human ﬁbroblast cell lines. Cultured cells (top center) were transfected, incubated and
assayed for relative transcriptional activity as depicted schematically at the left and detailed in Section 2. Results were expressed as fold-induction
by 1,25(OH)2D3. Cells of each line were also harvested for genomic DNA isolation and genotyping by PCR as shown at the upper right. For
determination of singlet(A) repeat length, multiple PCR products from exon IX of each line were sequenced individually (see sample gel at far
right). PCR products of exon II were digested with the Fok I restriction enzyme and resolved by electrophoresis (see sample gel at center-right).
Final results for each cell line thus included the genotype at both the 3% UTR singlet(A) site (L/S), and the translation initiation site (F/f ), along
with relative transactivation activity of the endogenous VDR (see sample summary graph at bottom center).

noted BGP-TKGH (Terpening et al., 1991)], along with
1.0 mg of pSG5-hVDR expressing either F/M4 or f/M1
hVDR. Sixteen hours post-transfection, the cells were
washed, and refed (DMEM:Ham’s F-12 medium sup-
plemented with 10% FBS, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100
mg/ml
streptomycin) and treated with 10− 8 M
1,25(OH)2D3 or ethanol vehicle. After 24 h, the level of
secreted growth hormone was assayed in the culture
medium from each plate as described above.

2.4. Genotyping of human ﬁbroblasts

DNA was prepared from cultured human ﬁbroblasts
(107 cells) using the QIAmp tissue kit (Qiagen Inc.,
Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer’s instruc-
tions. For F/f genotyping, isolated genomic DNA (500
ng) was combined with 100 ng each of primers 2a and
2b (Gross et al., 1996), along with 5 ml of 10X buffer
(Perkin Elmer, Norwalk, CT) plus 1.5 mM MgCl2, 2.5
mM each of dATP, dCTP, dTTP and dGTP, and 0.25
ml Taq DNA polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemi-
cals, Indianapolis, IN). PCR conditions were: 20 cycles
at 94°C for 30 s, 74°C for 30 s (with −0.1°C per cycle)
and 72°C for 60 s. This was followed by 25 cycles at
94°C for 30 s, 63°C for 30 s and 72°C for 60 s.
Approximately, 200 ng of unpuriﬁed PCR product was
then incubated with 1 ml Fok I enzyme (New England
Biolabs, Beverly, MA) and 1 ml 10X buffer in a total
volume of 10 ml for 1.5 h at 37°C. The digestion
mixture was electrophoresed on a 4% NuSieve (3:1)
Agarose gel in TBE buffer (90 mM Tris–borate, pH8,
2 mM EDTA) to determine whether the PCR product
was completely digested (indicating the ff genotype),
partially digested (Ff ) or completely undigested (FF).
For L/S genotyping, isolated genomic DNA (500 ng)
was combined with 5% and 3% primers (100 ng each)
(Ingles et al., 1997b) using the same PCR proﬁle de-
scribed above. PCR products at approximately 400–
425 bp were resolved on 0.8% Agarose gels, excised
from the gel and isolated into 20 ml of Tris–HCl, pH
8.5, using a QIAEX II extraction kit (Qiagen Inc.)
according to the protocol of the manufacturer. The
isolated PCR products (7.5 ml) were then cloned into
the T-vector and transformed into the XL-1 Blue strain
of E. coli using a T-vector kit (Promega Corp.). Plas-
mid DNA was isolated from transformed bacteria by
standard methods and sequenced (‘A’ reaction only)
using a T7 Sequenase kit (Amersham Pharmacia Bio-
tech, Piscataway, NJ). Typical results are depicted in
Fig. 3 (right).

2.5. GST coprecipitation assays

The ability of either F/M4 or f/M1 hVDRs to inter-
act with human TFIIB was assessed as described earlier
(Jurutka et al., 2000). Brieﬂy, TFIIB-glutathione-S-

transferase (GST) fusion protein was expressed from
pGEX-2T-hTFIIB (Baniahmad et al., 1993) and GST
alone was expressed from pGEX-4T, both in E. coli
strain DH5a. Each protein was then coupled to glu-
tathione Sepharose. For the GST ‘pull-down’ assays,
pSG5-hVDR vectors expressing either F/M4 or f/M1
hVDRs were used to generate [35S] methionine-labeled
proteins utilizing the TNT Coupled Reticulocyte Lysate
kit (Promega Corp.). The desired 35S-labeled protein
was then incubated with the beads in the absence or
presence of 1,25(OH)2D3 (10 − 6 M). Next, the unbound
proteins were washed from the beads with 4×1 ml
wash buffer [0.15 M KCl, 10 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.6, 1
mM EDTA, 0.3 mM ZnCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.1%
Tween-20, 1 mg/ml BSA, and the following protease
inhibitors, obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemi-
cals (Indianapolis, IN): 0.5 mg/ml Pefabloc SC, 15
mg/ml aprotinin, 1 mg/ml pepstatin A, 1 mg/ml
leu-
peptin]. The bound proteins were extracted from the
beads into 40 ml loading buffer (2% SDS, 5% b-mercap-
toethanol, 125 mM Tris–HCl, pH 6.8, and 20% glyc-
erol), boiled for 3 min, separated by SDS-PAGE and
visualized via autoradiography.

3. Results

3.1. Genotyping of human ﬁbroblast lines

As described in Section 2 and depicted schematically
in Fig. 3, genomic DNA samples were extracted from
twenty human ﬁbroblast cell lines, subjected to PCR
using two independent sets of primers, and analyzed for
their hVDR genotype at the polymorphic sites in exon
II (F/f ) and exon IX (L/S). F/f genotypes were deter-
mined by digestion of the PCR products from each line
with the restriction enzyme Fok I (Gross et al., 1996).
Two independent PCR reactions were performed for
each line, and digestion experiments included a ff and
Ff line as positive controls to monitor activity of the
Fok I restriction endonuclease. A typical digestion pat-
tern is shown at the center-right of Fig. 3, displaying
the undigested PCR product (265 bp), partially digested
DNA from a heterozygote, and completely digested
DNA (69 and 196 bp fragments) from an ff subject.
The frequencies of the F and f alleles in the present
sample group were 62.5 and 37.5%, respectively. This
distribution of hVDR alleles is similar to that charac-
terized for Caucasian populations in other studies
(Gross et al., 1996; Eccleshall et al., 1998; Gennari et
al., 1999).

L/S genotypes were determined by sequencing of
PCR products to ascertain the exact length of the
singlet(A) repeat (Ingles et al., 1997b). As reported by
others (Ingles et al., 1997a), we observed (Fig. 4) multi-
ple alleles at this locus which segregate into a ‘long’ (L)

tion with a 1,25(OH)2D3-responsive reporter plasmid
and incubation in the presence or absence of 10− 8 M
1,25(OH)2D3, expressed as fold-induction by the hor-
mone. The assay conditions,
including quantitative
monitoring of transfection efﬁciency using a b-galac-
tosidase vector, were designed to permit comparison of
endogenous VDR activity between cell lines. The data
(Fig. 5) reveal a striking spectrum of activities, ranging
from only a 1.75-fold induction of the growth hormone
reporter within the 72-h treatment period to a 100-fold
effect of hormone, with a mean of 28924 (S.D.) fold
induction. The lowest activity (1.75-fold induction by
1,25(OH)2D3) was observed in a ﬁbroblast line derived
from a 5-week-old embryo. As denoted in Fig. 5, a
subset of the tested ﬁbroblast cell lines are from pa-
tients with either osteoporosis (*), in which subjects are
usually normocalcemic, but can have low blood cal-
cium, or with William’s Syndrome (§), a condition
frequently presenting with hypercalcemia. Interestingly,
one of the William’s patients (DWF-CV) contains en-
dogenous VDR with the highest activity (100-fold in-
duction by 1,25(OH)2D3), while the other patient
displays
by
1,25(OH)2D3. Conversely, one of the osteoporosis pa-
tients (Ran Nor) yielded a very low VDR activity in the
assay (6-fold induction), while the two other os-
teoporotic individuals (Be Sal, Ber Lin) displayed in-
ductions by hormone that were only slightly below
average (18- and 22-fold, respectively). No other associ-
ations were noted between patient status (e.g., age, sex
or medical condition) and VDR activity (see Section 4).

3.3. Correlations between either Fok I or L/S genotype
and acti6ity of endogenous VDR

Given the current interest in the Fok I and L/S
hVDR polymorphisms, correlations were next sought
between the genotypes of each cell line at these two loci
and the relative activities of the corresponding endoge-
nous VDRs. Accordingly, all twenty cell lines examined
were grouped into ff (4 lines), Ff (7 lines) or FF (9
lines). The average fold-inductions by 1,25(OH)2D3 for
each group are displayed (9S.E.M.) in Fig. 6A. Al-
though no clear trend is evident, it is notable that the
FF group displays the highest average fold-induction by
the hormonal ligand. These F/f groupings were then
subdivided into sets with the LS genotype (Fig. 6C, left
panel) and the LL genotype (Fig. 6C, right panel),
thereby controlling for the L/S genotype when evaluat-
ing the activity of endogenous F/f hVDR. Again, in
both groups of data, the FF cells display the highest
activity. However, none of
the differences between
groupings in either Fig. 6A or 6C achieve statistical
signiﬁcance (at
the 95% conﬁdence interval), pre-
sumably because of the small number of cell lines in
each grouping or the possible existence of a novel

were observed in separate sequencing reactions from the same cell
line, presumably because of errors in PCR (Ingles et al., 1997a) or in
the bacterial replication of these repeated sequences. Allele frequen-
cies in the present sample of 20 cell lines were 40% S and 60% L,
nearly identical to published results of 41% S for Caucasians living in
the USA (Ingles et al., 1997a).

group with 17–24 A’s in the repeat, and a ‘short’ group
(S) with 10–15 A’s in the repeat. The frequencies of the
L and S hVDR alleles in the present panel of cell lines
were 60 and 40%, respectively, similar to that earlier
published for Caucasian populations (Ingles et al.,
1997a).

3.4. The F hVDR isoform is more acti6e in transfected
cells

Although the above F/f groupings did not show a
rigorous association between hVDR genotype and fold-
induction by 1,25(OH)2D3 (Fig. 6A and C), recent
results from other laboratories (Arai et al., 1997; Colin
et al., 2000) have demonstrated an apparent higher
activity for the F isoform of hVDR relative to the f
isoform. The results presented in Fig. 6 are generally
consistent with this conclusion. In addition, Fig. 7A
depicts an in vitro experiment in which the F and f
hVDR isoforms were expressed from a pSG5-hVDR
construct and directly tested for transcriptional activity.
The original pSG5-hVDR vector expresses the F/M4
isoform; a cDNA insert expressing the f/M1 was engi-
neered into this same vector via site-directed mutagene-
sis [see Section 2 and (Jurutka et al., 2000)]. These two
vectors were separately transfected into the VDR-deﬁ-
cient rat osteosarcoma line, ROS 2/3, along with the
BGP-TKGH reporter plasmid. The results of this anal-
ysis (Fig. 7A) show a signiﬁcant (PB0.001) difference
in fold-induction by 1,25(OH)2D3, with the F hVDR
construct displaying a greater response to 1,25(OH)2D3
(4.2-fold) than the f allele construct (2.6-fold).

Fig. 7. Relative activities of F/M4 hVDR and f/M1 hVDR, expressed
from an engineered construct. (A) An f/M1 hVDR cDNA, differing
at the translational start site, was created from an existing F/M4
cDNA by site-directed mutagenesis. Both cDNAs, cloned in the
vector pSG5, were used to express F/M4 and f/M1 hVDRs in
VDR-deﬁcient ROS 2/3 cells (Jurutka et al., 2000). Assays for relative
transcriptional activity were performed as described above for en-
dogenous VDR in human ﬁbroblast cell lines, except that the BGP-
TKGH reporter vector was used (see Section 2). The results shown
(triplicate assays9S.E.M.) are representative of at least three inde-
pendent experiments. (B) Using the same cDNAs as in (A), 35S-la-
beled F/M4 and f/M1 hVDRs were expressed in a coupled in vitro
transcription/translation system (see Section 2) and assayed for their
ability to bind a human TFIIB-glutathione S-transferase fusion
protein that had been immobilized on Sepharose beads (Jurutka et
al., 2000). Washed beads were denatured and subjected to elec-
trophoresis on 5–15% SDS-PAGE gels (see Section 2), and 35S-la-
beled protein bands were visualized by autoradiography (left panel of
B). The right panel of B displays autoradiograms of 35S-labeled
proteins used for the pull-down assays (5% of total input).

Fig. 6. Correlation of transcriptional activity with hVDR genotype.
(A) All 20 cells lines are grouped by F/f genotype. Each grouping
consists of the indicated number of lines, and the fold-induction
values for these lines (taken from Fig. 5) are represented as the
average9S.E.M. (B) As in (A), but all 20 cell lines are grouped by
L/S genotype. (C; left panel) The ten cell lines with genotype LS are
grouped by F/f genotype, and the average fold-induction by
9S.E.M. is shown. (C; right panel) The seven lines with
1,25(OH)2D3
an LL genotype are similarly grouped by F/f genotype and plotted.
The three SS hVDR cell lines are omitted from this analysis, since
they do not form a complete set of F/f groupings ( ffSS is missing).
(D; left panel) The seven cell lines with genotype Ff are grouped by
L/S genotype. (D; right panel) The nine lines with a FF genotype are
similarly grouped by L/S genotype and plotted. The four ff cell lines
are omitted, as they do not form a complete set of L/S groupings

genetic variable in hVDR activity. Nevertheless, the FF
groupings show higher fold-inductions than the corre-
sponding Ff groups, with the exception of lines with the
SS hVDR genotype (see Fig. 6D), appearing to conﬁrm
an effect of the F/f polymorphism and suggesting that
the F allele is more active.

When 1,25(OH)2D3-stimulated transcription activities
in the twenty lines are grouped by L/S genotype (Fig.
6B), a much clearer, but still not statistically signiﬁcant,
trend emerges, with SS having the lowest fold-induc-
tion, LL possessing the highest, and the LS genotype
exhibiting intermediate activity. This trend persists
when the groupings are subdivided into those with
constant Ff or FF genotypic backgrounds (Fig. 6D),
leading to the tentative conclusion that the L hVDR
allele is more active than the S allele. The SS and ff
subsets were not included in Fig. 6C and Fig. 6D,
because of the low number of samples of both SS and
ff homozygotes (3 and 4, respectively), as well as the
complete lack of the ffSS hVDR genotype in the cur-
rent series of ﬁbroblasts lines.

3.5. Relati6e ability of F/f hVDR isoforms to interact
with TFIIB, in 6itro

It has earlier been reported by our group (Jurutka et
al., 2000) that F hVDR interacts more efﬁciently with
TFIIB than does the f hVDR isoform, thus providing a
plausible mechanism for the greater transactivation po-
tency of the F hVDR. Fig. 7B illustrates a typical
experiment, utilizing the GST pull-down technique to
compare the abilities of in vitro-synthesized, 35S-labeled
F/M4 and f/M1 hVDR isoreceptors to interact with an
immobilized TFIIB fusion protein. Even in the face of
a higher input of 35S-labeled f/M1 protein, the F/M4
protein shows a reproducibly greater (approximately
2-fold) ability to interact with TFIIB, when compared
with the f/M1 protein under the same conditions (Ju-
rutka et al., 2000). Whether this difference in activity
reﬂects that occurring under in vivo conditions is not
known; however, these results provide a reasonable
mechanism by which to explain the enhanced transacti-
vation ability of the F/M4 hVDR isoform, in vitro, and
are consistent with a proposed bioactivity for F hVDR
that is also greater than that of f hVDR, in vivo [(Gross
et al., 1996; Arai et al., 1997; Harris et al., 1997; Tao et
al., 1998; Videman et al., 1998; Correa et al., 1999;
Ferrari et al., 1999; Gennari et al., 1999; Kurabayashi
et al., 1999; Lucotte et al., 1999; Colin et al., 2000; Sosa
et al., 2000), see Section 4].

each increasing increment in allele score yielding a
higher average fold-induction by 1,25(OH)2D3. A quali-
tatively similar trend was seen if 1,25(OH)2D3-stimu-
lated values for reporter gene production were plotted
instead of
fold-induction values (data not shown).
Thus, the dramatic escalation of hVDR functional ac-
tivity appears to correlate to the combined hVDR
genotypic allele score at the F/f and L/S loci. Impor-
tantly, the difference between the two groups with allele
scores of 2 and 4 achieves statistical signiﬁcance by the
two-tailed Student’s t-test (P=0.035).

Fig. 8B depicts the identical data set analyzed in A,
but with each cell line plotted as an individual point.
When a linear regression line is calculated for all 20
lines, the allele score shows a moderately strong, and
statistically signiﬁcant, positive correlation with trans-
activation (correlation coefﬁcient=0.595; P=0.012).
If, however, the cell lines are divided into a high group
(above the n=20 regression line) and low group (below
the n=20 line), the respective correlation coefﬁcients
are markedly improved, to 0.958 for the high group
(n=8, P B0.001) and 0.858 for the low group (n=12,
PB0.001). This apparent segregation of values into
high and low groups argues for the existence of a new,
third variable, other than the Fok I or 3% cluster of
polymorphisms containing L/S, in determining hVDR
functional activity.

3.6. Correlation between genotype at both polymorphic
loci and transacti6ation by endogenous VDRs

4. Discussion

Considering the lack of genetic linkage between the
Fok I and L/S polymorphisms (Gross et al., 1996;
Ferrari et al., 1998; Cheng and Tsai, 1999), plus the fact
that both loci appear to affect function of the endoge-
nous receptor,
in vivo (Fig. 6), as well as evidence
indicating that F hVDR is more active than f, in vitro,
we attempted next to correlate the combined genotypes
at both loci with hVDR transactivation ability. In order
to condense genotypic information from both sites into
a single variable, an ‘allele score’ was devised based on
which allelic variants appear more active in the litera-
ture and in the present experiments. Since the F geno-
type is more active than f both in vivo and in vitro,
each F hVDR allele was assigned a value of 1, while f
alleles were scored as zero. Likewise, because the data
in Fig. 6, panels B and D, indicate the L hVDR alleles
to be more active than the S alleles, L and S alleles
received scores of 1 and 0, respectively. Since the hVDR
gene resides on an autosome (chromosome 12) (Szpirer
et al., 1991), possible total allele scores range from 0 to
4 for both sexes. After grouping all twenty cell lines
according to this formula, the average fold-induction
by 1,25(OH)2D3 was plotted versus the allele score (Fig.
8A). A striking trend emerges from this analysis, with

A goal of the present study was to examine endoge-
nous hVDR transcriptional activity in relation to
hVDR genotype at unlinked polymorphic sites in both
exons II and IX. The results reveal a strong correlation
between genotype and VDR activity that emerges when
both polymorphic sites are simultaneously considered
(Fig. 8). A corollary of this conclusion is that variation
at both polymorphic sites is important to hVDR func-
tional activity, in vivo, but that considering each site
separately may not reveal signiﬁcant effects. Thus, the
current data may explain why many attempts to corre-
late hVDR activity with genotype at a single locus have
been unsuccessful.

The allelic distributions found in the present sample
are similar to genotype frequencies in the published
literature. The 62.5% frequency reported here for the F
allele is comparable to the 63.5% published for Italian
women (Gennari et al., 1999), the 62% for French
women (Eccleshall et al., 1998) and the 61% for Mexi-
can-American Caucasian women (Gross et al., 1996),
but lower than the incidences of the F allele (68.5%)
observed for Japanese women (Arai et al., 1997), or the
80.5% reported for African-American women (Harris et
al., 1997). Concerning the singlet(A) L/S alleles, the
frequency of the L allele in the present sample, 60%,

Fig. 8. Correlation of transcriptional activity with hVDR genotype at both L/S and F/f loci. (A) Results from Fig. 5 were grouped according to
an ‘allele score’, computed as the sum of F and L alleles in each cell line. As indicated earlier, no cell lines with the ffSS hVDR genotype are
included in the cell lines studied; hence, no cell line with a score of zero could be evaluated. The average of the group with a score of two is
signiﬁcantly different from the average of the group with a score of 4 (P=0.035) as assessed by the two-tailed Student’s t-test. (B) The data from
(A) were plotted as individual points instead of the average of each group, with each point representing a single cell line. The linear regression
ﬁt for all 20 points is represented by a dotted line. The regression line for an apparent ‘high’ group (	, n=8) is shown as a dashed line, while
the remaining lines appear to form a ‘low’ group (, n=12), with its regression ﬁt illustrated as a solid line.

again resembles published results for Caucasians (59%),
but is less than that noted for Hispanics (69%), African-
Americans (71%), Japanese-Americans (91%), and Chi-
nese (91%) (Ingles et al., 1997a).

The assignment of F as the more active hVDR allele
is based not only on the current analysis of ﬁbroblast
lines, but also on in vitro data collected with F and f
proteins expressed in transfected cells [Fig. 7 and (Arai
et al., 1997; Jurutka et al., 2000)]. Another group (Colin
et al., 2000) has also studied F versus f hVDR proteins,
and reported a lower ED50 for 1,25(OH)2D3 with the F
allele. These data indicating a more active F hVDR
allele are consistent with a number of epidemiological
studies which suggest that the F allele, when compared
with the f allele,
is associated with increased BMD
(Gross et al., 1996; Arai et al., 1997; Harris et al., 1997;
Tao et al., 1998; Ferrari et al., 1999; Lucotte et al.,
1999), higher rates of bone turnover (Kurabayashi et
al., 1999), lower risk for primary hyperparathyroidism
(Correa et al., 1999; Sosa et al., 2000), lower risk for
intervertebral disc degeneration (Videman et al., 1998)
and lower incidence of vertebral fracture (Gennari et
al., 1999). However, it should be acknowledged that not
all studies have found these associations. For instance,
one group (Eccleshall et al., 1998) did not observe a
correlation between hVDR genotype and BMD in a
large cohort of French women. Also, another group
(Gross et al., 1998) was unable to correlate any hVDR-
related functional parameter with F/f genotype in either
cells transfected with vectors expressing F versus f
hVDRs, or in a small panel of human ﬁbroblast lines,
although perhaps because of methodological
limita-

tions, small differences in activity may have escaped
detection. Additionally, as discussed above, the fact
that only the F/f genotype was considered in the above
investigations implies that the L/S genotype could have
been a signiﬁcant confounder in these studies.

The assignment of L hVDR as more active than S is
based exclusively on observations with the present
panel of ﬁbroblast cell lines. L and S hVDR alleles do
not produce different proteins, and, therefore, cannot
be tested in the same fashion as F/f isoforms. As a
provocative test of this assignment, we instead enter-
tained the alternative hypothesis that S hVDR alleles
are more active, and replotted the data in Fig. 8A.
However, the plot of this modiﬁed allele score (F+S)
versus transcriptional activity appeared to show an
inverse correlation between hVDR allele score and
bioactivity (data not shown). This exercise, plus the
present data (Fig. 6 and Fig. 8), strongly support the
premise that L is the more active hVDR allele. Since
this polymorphism occurs in exon IX, but is expressed
only in the 3% UTR of hVDR mRNA, the working
hypothesis presented herein states that the L allele may
produce receptor mRNA that is more stable and/or is
translated more efﬁciently into hVDR protein than the
S allele.

Pertinent to the hypothesis above, the mRNA stabil-
ities of allelic variants in or adjacent to exon IX [i.e.,
considering one or more sites in the Bsm/Taq/Apa/sin-
glet(A) cluster] have been evaluated in recent studies
using various
(Morrison et al., 1994;
Mocharla et al., 1997; Verbeek et al., 1997; Carling et
al., 1998; Gross et al., 1998; Durrin et al., 1999).

investigations,

Mirroring the epidemiological
these
studies have yielded conﬂicting results. In one set of
experiments (Verbeek et al., 1997),
lymphocytes het-
erozygous for the Taq polymorphism were examined. It
was found that, whereas mRNA stabilities were similar
for both alleles, the mRNA from the t allele (linked to
S) was consistently 30% less abundant. This result was
interpreted as suggesting a possible difference in tran-
scriptional regulation between the two allelic forms
studied, although no mechanism for this effect was
proposed (Verbeek et al., 1997). In contrast, another
study (Carling et al., 1998) examining pituitary ade-
nomas from 42 patients showed that B and t alleles
were associated with higher hVDR mRNA levels,
reaching statistical signiﬁcance when homozygous BB
or tt lines were compared with bb or TT homozygotes.
Results similar to those of Carling et al. were obtained
by others (Morrison et al., 1994), using a heterologous
system in which 3.2 kb of 3% UTR from two subjects
homozygous for either BAtS or baTL were linked to a
luciferase reporter gene. In transfected COS-7 cells, the
BAtS construct displayed higher luciferase activity, sug-
gesting to these authors that either transcriptional ac-
tivity of the construct itself, or mRNA stability of its
transcript, were more favorably affected by attachment
of the BAtS as opposed to the baTL 3% UTR (Morrison
et al., 1994). Finally, three further groups reported no
signiﬁcant effect of 3% UTR allelic variants on hVDR
mRNA. These studies examined B versus b mRNA
abundance in blood monocytes (Mocharla et al., 1997),
B versus b hVDR protein and mRNA abundance in
cultured skin ﬁbroblasts (Gross et al., 1998), and stabil-
ity of globin mRNAs attached to L or S 3% UTRs in
transfected NIH3T3 cells (Durrin et al., 1999). In par-
ticular, the last study, in which methodology similar to
that of Morrison et al. was used, strongly suggests that
the baTL and BAtS 3% UTRs do not confer different
mRNA stabilities, at least when attached to a het-
erologous (rabbit b globin) mRNA (Durrin et al.,
1999).

Drawing conclusions from the above investigations
with respect to the L/S polymorphism must be done
cautiously, since only two of the six studies cited above
(Morrison et al., 1994; Durrin et al., 1999) actually
determined L/S genotype in their subjects. Neverthe-
less, given the reasonably tight linkage between Bsm I
and singlet(A) polymorphisms (Ingles et al., 1997a), the
above discussed results, when taken together, do sug-
gest that mRNA stability may not be a major mecha-
nism distinguishing the activity of L versus S alleles.
The possibility remains, however, that the L allele in
some fashion produces more VDR protein from a given
unit of mRNA. While there is a paucity of data to
support or refute such a conclusion, it is notable that
ligand binding assays (Gross et al., 1998) seem to
indicate a trend toward higher VDR abundance (ex-

not

these

differences were

pressed as Nmax) in bb versus BB ﬁbroblast lines, al-
though
statistically
signiﬁcant. Should it be the case that L alleles (linked to
b) produce more hVDR protein, what could be the
mechanism for such an effect? Recent observations
regarding mammalian and yeast poly(A) binding
proteins (PABPs) indicate that binding of PABP to
mRNA enhances translatability of mRNAs via an in-
teraction with other proteins that interact with the 5%
end of the message (Munroe and Jacobson, 1990; Le et
al., 1997). Usually, multiple PABP monomers bind to
poly(A)+ RNAs, with each monomer occupying ap-
proximately 27 adenylate residues (Baer and Kornberg,
1980). Intriguingly, further studies with human PABP
suggest that as few as 11 consecutive A’s can bind to
PABP, with 25 A’s giving maximum afﬁnity (Deo et al.,
1999). Thus, one could speculate that: (a) PABP may be
capable of binding to the singlet(A) repeat in the hVDR
gene; and (b) its ability to bind may be enhanced in
long (L) alleles (17–24 A’s) versus short (S) alleles
(10–15 A’s). Greater association of PABP with L alle-
les would then lead to more efﬁcacious translation via a
more potent interaction with translation factors such as
EF-4B (Le et al., 1997).

a

using

1,25(OH)2D3-responsive

Regardless of the potential mechanism, the endoge-
nous VDR activities, as measured in the present experi-
ments
reporter
plasmid, showed a surprising range of activities, from
1.75- to 100-fold induction by 1,25(OH)2D3 It is as-
serted that the current results are valid when comparing
cell lines within the studied group, particularly because
the data were normalized for transfection efﬁciency as
monitored by inclusion of an expression plasmid for
b-galactosidase. It is possible, nonetheless, that the
presence of four closely-spaced vitamin D responsive
elements in the (CT4)4TKGH reporter construct used
could exaggerate small differences in activity that may
be much more subtle under in vivo conditions, espe-
cially considering that natural promoters often possess
a single, or at most, two vitamin D responsive elements
(Haussler et al., 1998). Indeed, the results with the
BGP-TKGH, which contains a single VDRE element,
revealed more modest transactivation levels in trans-
fected cells (see Fig. 7A) and a less dramatic difference
between F versus f hVDR activity.

The absence in the current sample set of a cell line
with an allele score of zero (i.e. ffSS) is notable because
it did not allow an evaluation of the activity of this
genotype. The obvious explanation for this absence is
the fact that, since hVDR ff and SS homozygotes are
relatively uncommon among Caucasians (19 and 15%,
respectively), the combination of ffSS would, therefore,
represent a rare genotype (estimated frequency about
3% in Caucasians). Given the observed correlation be-
tween allele score and fold-induction by 1,25(OH)2D3
(Fig. 8B), it is predicted that cells with this genotype

G. Kerr Whitﬁeld et al. /Molecular and Cellular Endocrinology 177 (2001) 145–159

155

would have very low relative transcriptional activity. A
recent epidemiological study (Hutchinson et al., 2000),
in which a large cohort with malignant melanoma was
genotyped at the T/t and F/f loci, supports this conclu-
sion. It was found that fftt (recall that t is often linked
to S) had signiﬁcantly thicker tumors (P=0.001).
These results intimate that the fftt allele combination
might be associated with less active hVDR, as VDR has
been reported to have antiproliferative effects that
might be expected to counter the malignant phenotype
(Haussler et al., 1998). Clearly, more ﬁbroblast lines
must be examined to answer these questions, and it will
be interesting to determine if ffSS hVDR cell
lines
actually possess very low hVDR activity. Should this be
the case, the provocative possibility could be raised that
this rare ffSS hVDR genotype might be so disadvanta-
geous with respect to calcium and bone metabolism
that it has been sharply reduced in the gene pool.

The two ﬁbroblast lines in the present panel from
patients with William’s Syndrome exhibited very differ-
ent hVDR activities, with the endogenous VDR in the
DWF-CV line displaying extremely high (100-fold) in-
duction by 1,25(OH)2D3, and the DWF-TW line dis-
playing near-average activity (23-fold induction). The
extremely high activity of the DWF-CV line (three
standard deviations above the mean of 28924 fold-in-
duction) suggests a possible association with the hyper-
calcemia often seen in patients with William’s
Syndrome. However, because the great majority of
William’s Syndrome cases involve a chromosomal dele-
tion at 7q11.23 (Ewart et al., 1993), and the hVDR
gene resides on chromosome 12, this syndrome would
appear to be unrelated to VDR action (as seems to be
the case with patient DWF-TW). However, it is con-
ceivable that patient DWF-CV, whose ﬁbroblasts ex-
hibit extremely elevated VDR activity, may represent
an atypical William’s case that does involve increased
sensitivity to 1,25(OH)2D3, a mechanism that has al-
ready been speculated for isolated cases resembling
Williams’s Syndrome (Ghirri et al., 1999).

Concerning the three osteoporotic patients in the
current sample set, two ﬁbroblast lines showed normal
hVDR activity, but a third (Ran Nor, from a 69-year-
old male) displayed very low induction of the reporter
gene (6.2-fold versus the average of 28-fold). The low
activity of hVDR in the Ran Nor cell sample could, in
theory, be related to the low bone density of osteoporo-
sis. However, osteoporosis is a multifactorial disease
and, therefore, a very large study would be required to
test any relationship between its etiology and hVDR
alleles.

The lowest induction of the tested reporter construct
by 1,25(OH)2D3 (1.75-fold) was observed in the trans-
fected cell line HS 144.We, taken from a 5-week-old
embryo. These cells represent one of two prenatal cell
lines in the present panel; thus, one possible explana-

tion for the very low hVDR activity is that cells from
this early gestational stage may not yet be differentiated
sufﬁciently to express VDR at levels seen postnatally.
However, the other fetal cell line, HE-SK (exact fetal
age unknown), displayed a slightly above average in-
duction of 35.4-fold. Further arguing against the above
interpretation is the observation from this laboratory
that, with the exception of tissues like intestine that are
phenotypically responsive to vitamin D in the adult,
VDR expression has actually been shown to diminish in
rat and chick tissues such as muscle and liver when they
mature beyond the embryonic stage (M.R. Haussler
and K. Yamaoka, unpublished data). Other groups
have also observed VDR expression in various embry-
onic and fetal tissues (Takeuchi et al., 1994; Johnson et
al., 1995; Delvin et al., 1996; Johnson et al., 1996;
Veenstra et al., 1998; Segura et al., 1999). Finally, given
that the HS 144.We line has an allele score of 1
(genotype FfSS),
its observed fold-induction of 1.75
resides between a predicted value of 5.3-fold stimula-
tion by 1,25(OH)2D3 using the regression line for all 19
other lines, and a prediction of negligible stimulation
(i.e. close to 1.0-fold) for the ‘low group’ regression line
(both values calculated from plots similar to that of
Fig. 8B, but omitting the HS 144.We data point). Thus,
the observed HS 144.We hVDR transcriptional activity
is not outside the predicted range for its allele score.
Regardless, the data do not rule out early developmen-
tal-stage variations in human VDR expression, a topic
that deserves further study.

The presence of two distinct groupings of hVDR
activity versus allele score at the F/f plus L/S loci in
Fig. 8B argues in favor of the existence of another
variable that inﬂuences innate hVDR activity, at least
in ﬁbroblasts. There are a number of potential variables
to consider, including such parameters as age and sex
of the patients from whom the cells were taken. An
analysis of these variables in the current sample set
reveals that, although the gender distribution between
the high and low groups of Fig. 8B is similar (60 and
50% male, respectively), the average age is somewhat
higher in the low group, but this difference is without
statistical signiﬁcance (20.9 versus 4.8 years, P=0.11).
Thus, based on the current data, it is contended that
age and sex of the cell donors would not be satisfactory
explanations for the existence of a high and a low
activity group.

Instead, the hypothesis put forth in the present com-
munication (Fig. 9) is that there exists one or more
additional polymorphic variations in the hVDR gene
beyond those at the F/f locus and in the 3% cluster
(Apa/Bsm/Taq and L/S) that affect(s) hVDR activity.
The coding exons of the hVDR gene have been studied
rather extensively, and have yielded numerous point
mutations causing hereditary vitamin D resistant rickets
(Hawa et al., 1996; Lin et al., 1996; Whitﬁeld et al.,

156

G. Kerr Whitﬁeld et al. /Molecular and Cellular Endocrinology 177 (2001) 145–159

1996; Haussler et al., 1998), but no evidence has been
presented for the occurrence of common polymorphic
sites other than the Fok I site in exon II and the linked
cluster of sites in the exon VIII–IX region. Yet recent
investigations into the portion of the hVDR gene en-
coding the 5% untranslated region (5% UTR) have re-
vealed a surprising complex of at least seven exons
(denoted IA-IG, see Fig. 9, top left), with evidence for
alternative splicing (Miyamoto et al., 1997; Crofts et
al., 1998). It is possible that undiscovered common
polymorphic sites may exist in this newly described
complex of multiple exons at the 5% end of the gene.
Such polymorphisms could even alter VDR protein
structure by introducing in-frame initiator methionine
codons leading to the expression of VDRs with N-ter-
minal extensions, as already proposed by one research
group (Crofts et al., 1998).

Still another possibility is that polymorphisms in the
5% region of the VDR gene might affect the activity of
one of the three proposed hVDR promoters (Crofts et
al., 1998), leading to the expression of altered quantities
of VDR proteins under physiologic conditions. Here
again, a precedent exists from a recent report (Arai et
al., 1999 J. Bone Miner. Res. 14, S191, Abstract T084),
which describes a polymorphism in a binding site for

Cdx-2, a homeodomain protein related to caudal (posi-
tion of Cdx binding site in the hVDR gene is shown in
Fig. 9, top left). The importance of Cdx-2 for intestine-
speciﬁc expression of hVDR was demonstrated earlier
(Yamamoto et al., 1999). It is, of course, not possible to
invoke this polymorphism to explain the present results
in ﬁbroblast lines, given the intestine-speciﬁc nature of
Cdx-2 regulated expression (Suh et al., 1994). However,
the existence of this polymorphism should certainly be
considered in epidemiological studies relating VDR-me-
diated intestinal absorption of calcium and phosphate
as they impact BMD and parathyroid gland function.
Indeed, in a large cohort of Japanese women, the A
allele at the Cdx-2 locus correlated with higher BMD in
the lumbar spine, consistent with a slightly greater
activity of a VDR promoter construct incorporating the
Cdx-A type element (Arai et al., 1999, J. Bone Miner.
Res. 14, S191, Abstract T084).

Rather than evoking Cdx-2 or any other known
polymorphism to explain the present results, we prefer
the interpretation that a novel polymorphism exists,
likely located in the incompletely characterized 5% re-
gion of the hVDR gene. A full recognition of the
genetic complexity of VDR action in humans may
eventually allow for accurate prediction of VDR activ-

Fig. 9. Summary of common polymorphic variations in the hVDR gene that may inﬂuence VDR activity. The exon arrangement (top) is described
in Fig. 2 and the associated text. The long (L) variant of the singlet(A) repeat in exon IX is proposed herein to be associated with increased VDR
amount. A speculative mechanism for this effect is the enhanced ability of ]17 consecutive As to recruit poly(A) binding protein, which would
presumably stabilize VDR mRNA and/or promote its translation into hVDR protein (see text). The F/f polymorphism in exon II has likewise
been shown to be associated with VDR activity, with the F isoform displaying both moderately higher transcriptional activity, as well as
measurably greater interaction, in vitro, with TFIIB (Jurutka et al., 2000). Recently, a third hVDR polymorphism has been described upstream
of exon IG in a binding site for the intestine-speciﬁc enhancer protein Cdx-2 (Arai et al., 1999, J. Bone Miner. Res. 14, S191, Abstract T084). This
polymorphism may be signiﬁcant for its effects on hVDR expression in intestinal cells (Yamamoto et al., 1999). All three of the illustrated
polymorphisms are proposed to affect either the quantity of expressed VDR in human tissues (Cdx-2 and L/S), or the ability of VDR to interact
with other proteins such as TFIIB (F/f, as illustrated at bottom right), in order to impact the transcription of target genes. Finally, it is suggested
that other functionally relevant VDR gene polymorphisms may exist, especially in the recently-described complex of exons encoding the 5%-UTR.

an enhanced ability to assess disease risk, as well as
response to pharmacologic agents related to VDR
action.

Heme Iron from Meat and Risk of Colorectal Cancer:
A Meta-analysis and a Review of the Mechanisms Involved

Nadia M. Bastide, Fabrice H.F. Pierre, and Denis E. Corpet

Abstract

Red meat and processed meat intake is associated with a risk of colorectal cancer, a major cause of
death in affluent countries. Epidemiological and experimental evidence supports the hypothesis that
heme iron present in meat promotes colorectal cancer. This meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies
of colon cancer reporting heme intake included 566,607 individuals and 4,734 cases of colon cancer.
The relative risk of colon cancer was 1.18 (95% CI: 1.06–1.32) for subjects in the highest category of
heme iron intake compared with those in the lowest category. Epidemiological data thus show a
suggestive association between dietary heme and risk of colon cancer. The analysis of experimental
studies in rats with chemically-induced colon cancer showed that dietary hemoglobin and red meat
consistently promote aberrant crypt foci, a putative precancer lesion. The mechanism is not known, but
heme iron has a catalytic effect on (i) the endogenous formation of carcinogenic N-nitroso compounds
and (ii) the formation of cytotoxic and genotoxic aldehydes by lipoperoxidation. A review of
evidence supporting these hypotheses suggests that both pathways are involved in heme iron toxicity.

Introduction

Cancer of the colon and rectum, taken together, are the
third most common type of cancer worldwide (1). In most
publications, colon and rectal cancer are studied together
and the term colorectal cancer (CRC) is used, which we also
use here, except when the publications refer specifically to
colon or rectal cancer. CRC is the second most common
cause of cancer death in affluent countries. Dietary mod-
ifications might reduce this cancer burden by up to 70%
(2). Three recent meta-analyses showed that total meat
intake is not related to risk but that intake of red or
processed meat is associated with a modest, but significant
risk of CRC (3–5). Processed meat intake appears to be
more closely linked with the risk of CRC than fresh red
meat intake. In its 2007 report, the World Cancer Research
Fund panel recommended that one should limit intake of
red meat and avoid processed meat (1).

Several mechanisms may explain the relationship
between the risk of CRC and the intake of red or pro-

cessed meat. First, meat cooked at high temperature
contains mutagenic heterocyclic amines. But heterocyclic
amines might not be major players in CRC risk, as: (i)
consumption of chicken is a major contributor to intake
of heterocyclic amines, but is not associated with the risk
(6); and (ii) doses of heterocyclic amines that induce
cancer in animals are 1,000 to 100,000 times higher than
the dose ingested by humans (7). A second hypothesis
suggests that the high saturated fat content of red and
processed meat increases the risk of CRC. But several

effect of
saturated fat on colorectal carcinogenesis
(8–11). A third hypothesis concerns the carcinogenic
N-nitroso compounds (NOC), which can be formed in
the gastrointestinal
tract by N-nitrosation of peptide
derived amines or amides. The role of NOC in human
cancer is discussed in the following text. Other more
unlikely hypotheses involve the high protein, cholesterol,
and salt content of red or processed meat. For a review of
all these mechanisms, see ref. 12.

Sesink and colleagues suggested that heme iron, in the
form of hemin [chloroprotoporphyrin IX iron(III)] a ferric
form of heme, may explain the link between the risk of
colon cancer and red meat intake, and the lack of a link
with white meat intake (13). Epidemiological and experi-
mental evidence support heme toxicity. Heme consists of
an iron atom present at the center of a large heterocyclic
organic ring called a porphyrin (Fig. 1). Heme is included
in so-called hemoprotein, that is, hemoglobin, myoglobin
(both involved in the oxygen supply), and in cytochromes
(which catalyze electron transfer reactions). Red meat

dark red color to the presence of a high concentration of
myoglobin, and the heme content of red meat is 10-fold
higher than that of white meat (such as chicken; ref. 14). In
processed red meat, heme iron is nitrosylated, because
curing salt contains nitrate or nitrite (Fig. 1; ref. 12).

The aims of the present mini-review were: (i) to conduct
a meta-analysis of epidemiological cohort studies on heme
intake and the risk of colon cancer; (ii) to review experi-
mental evidence supporting the aforementioned heme
hypothesis; and (iii) to understand the mechanism of
action of heme in carcinogenesis.

Heme iron intake and risk of colon cancer:
a meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies

the magnitude of

The objective of this part of the review was to assess,
through meta-analysis,
the relation
between heme iron intake and colon cancer. As most
studies do not report data on rectal cancer, we decided
to limit our analysis to colon cancer. The methodological
procedure is described in the Supplementary Material to
this article.

The characteristics of the 5 prospective cohort studies
included in the meta-analysis are summarized in Supple-
mentary Data (Table S1). This meta-analysis included
data on 566,607 individuals and 4,734 cases of colon
cancer. Although 1 cohort study found no association
between heme and cancer (15), 3 found that a high intake
of heme iron was linked with a higher risk of colon cancer
(16–18), and 1 found a positive, but not significant,
association between heme iron and colon cancer (19;
Fig. 2). In the Lee and colleagues study, the relative risk
(RR) for both proximal and distal colon was 1.53 (95%
CI: 0.99–2.38). In the Balder and colleagues study, the
association was positive in the 2 genders combined (RR ¼
1.35, 95% CI: 1.03–1.77; ref. 17). The summary RR of
colon cancer in all 5 studies was 1.18 (95% CI: 1.06–
1.32) for subjects in the highest category of heme iron
intake compared with those in the lowest category
(Fig. 2). This meta-analysis showed a consistent associa-
tion between high intake of heme iron and increased risk
of colon cancer.

Two studies out of 5 considered calcium in the adjust-
ments for the RR (16–18), and showed the strongest

Heme Iron and Colorectal Cancer

In conclusion, this meta-analysis showed a significant
and consistent but modest increase in the risk of colon
cancer associated with high heme iron intake. This study
should be pursued by future prospective cohort studies, but
this epidemiological result is in line with experimental
in vivo results detailed in the following text.

Experimental evidence of colorectal cancer promotion
by heme iron

Sawa and colleagues showed that dietary hemoglobin
produces lipid peroxyl radicals and increases the inci-
dence of nitrosomethylurea-induced colon cancer in rats
fed polyunsaturated fat (24). Sesink and colleagues
studied the effect of hemin-supplemented diet in non-
initiated rats. Dietary hemin increases fat peroxidation
and cytotoxic activity of fecal water, and epithelial pro-
liferation by 70% (13). In hemin, the iron atom is
stabilized by a freely exchangeable chloride. Pierre
and colleagues also showed that hemin and hemoglobin
increase the number of azoxymethane-induced aberrant
crypt foci, which are putative preneoplastic lesions, in
the colon of rats (21). In contrast with hemin, dietary
hemoglobin does not increase the cytotoxicity of fecal
water, and it is less potent than hemin in promoting
colon carcinogenesis. Hemoglobin may be a suitable
substitute for myoglobin in nutritional experiments
with animal model, and a model agent for studies on
the cytotoxicity of red meat (21).

Pierre and colleagues also fed 3 types of meat with
different heme content (chicken, beef, and blood sausage)
to rats treated with azoxymethane and fed a low-calcium
diet (25). This study was the first to show that dietary meat
can promote colon carcinogenesis, and that the effect
depends on the heme concentration. The results of this
study of meat contrast with those of several earlier studies,
where red-meat based high-calcium diets failed to promote
colon carcinogenesis, indicating probable protection by
calcium (26). Subsequently, Pierre and colleagues tested
the hypothesis, suggested by epidemiology, that nitrosyl
heme in processed meat was more toxic than native heme
in fresh meat (27). Cured meat can indeed promote colon
carcinogenesis in rats (27). Dietary hemin, but not hemo-
globin, could be used as a model agent to mimic the effects
of processed meat in rats (27). In a recent study, Pierre and
colleagues demonstrated that the nitrosylation of heme
was a key event in the promoting effect of processed meat in
rats (28).

Analysis of the results of experimental studies of rats with
chemically-induced colon cancer (21, 22, 25, 29), showed
that the global standardized effect size for number of
aberrant crypt foci per colon was 1.73 (95% CI: 1.33–
2.14) in rats given dietary heme iron in hemoglobin or beef
meat, compared with control rats. The logistic regression
approach showed a significant correlation between the
number of aberrant crypts per colon and the concentration
of heme in the diet (P ¼ 0.02; see Methods and Figure in
Supplementary Data). This experimental evidence that
heme iron promotes carcinogenesis in rats is consistent

association between heme iron and colon cancer. This
makes sense, as calcium inhibits heme-induced cytotoxi-
city, colonic epithelial hyperproliferation, and promotion
of chemically induced carcinogenesis in animal models
(20–22).

Two studies we excluded from the meta-analysis found
similar results. An ecological study found a direct correla-
tion between the dietary iron index and colon and rectal
cancer (23). Ferrucci and colleagues observed a positive,
but not significant, association between heme iron in diet
and colorectal adenoma.

The present meta-analysis is the first to examine the
relation between heme iron and colon cancer. But this
study also has its limitations; first it includes only 5
cohort studies, and the way heme intake was measured
differs in each study. Lee and colleagues and Larsson and
colleagues calculated heme iron content in the diet by
applying a factor of 0.4 to the total iron content of all
meat items which essentially is reporting an overall red
meat effect (16, 18). Balder and colleagues multiplied the
heme iron content of each meat item by the mean daily
intake of the relevant food item, estimated from the
Dutch Food Composition Database (17), but the 2 meth-
ods yielded similar results (15). Cross and colleagues
developed a new heme iron database based on measured
values in conjunction with a detailed meat cooking ques-
tionnaire (19).

with epidemiological evidence. Heme promotion may
explain why the intake of red and processed meat is
associated with a risk of CRC.

Possible mechanisms of heme toxicity in the
gastrointestinal tract

The mechanisms implicated in the promotion of color-
ectal cancer by heme are poorly understood. The mechan-
istic hypotheses are based on the catalytic effect of heme
iron on (i) the formation of NOC and (ii) the formation of
lipid oxidation endproducts.

Heme iron catalyzes N-nitrosation

NOC are formed by N-nitrosation of amines and
amides, produced primarily by bacterial decarboxylation
of amino acids in the presence of a nitrosating agent
(30). There was no a priori reason to think that nitrosa-
tion would require heme iron. The structure of nitrosa-
mine is shown in Figure 1. NOC can be detected by
thermal energy analysis following the release of nitric
oxide from biological samples. This analytical procedure
comprises nitrosyl iron and S-nitrosothiols in addition to
nitrosamines and nitrosamides, which are collectively
total N-nitroso compounds
referred to as apparent
(ATNC; ref. 31).

Animal and human studies. Bacon-fed rats had a fecal
concentration of ATNC 10 to 20 times higher than control
rats (32). In addition, mice fed a diet of hot-dogs (18%),
had 4 to 5 times more ATNC, and mice fed a beef diet had 2
to 3 times more ATNC in their feces than controls fed no
meat (33, 34).

Human volunteers given a high red meat diet excreted
much more ATNC in their stools than controls given no
or little red meat, or only white meat (31, 35, 36). The
fecal concentration of ATNC was 60 times higher in
volunteers given cured red meat
than in volunteers
given a vegetarian diet (37). Heme iron, and not inor-
ganic iron or meat proteins, may be responsible for the
nitrosation observed in the gut of volunteers fed red
meat (38).

Nature of ATNC. A red meat diet increased nitrosyl
iron and nitrosothiols in ileal outputs and in stools of
volunteers, compared with a vegetarian diet, suggesting
that these compounds contribute significantly to ATNC
(39, 40). Nitrosothiols are rapidly formed from nitrite
and thiol groups at low pH in the stomach and can be
precursors for the formation of nitrosyl heme and NOC in
the gut (39). The strong correlation between fecal nitrosyl
iron and fecal heme suggests that nitrosyl heme is the
main source of nitrosyl
iron (39). Moreover, ATNC
precursors from hot dogs were partially purified and
separated by HPLC (41). One fraction was identified as
1-deoxy-N-1-glucosyl glycine by mass spectrometry, and
the nitrosated fraction was shown to be mutagenic by the
Ames test (41).

Carcinogenicity of nitrosated compounds. The carcino-
genicity of ATNC formed in the gut after eating heme from
red or processed meat is unknown. Parnaud and colleagues

found no initiation or promotion of preneoplastic lesions
by ATNC in the colon of rats fed a bacon-based diet (32).
Kunhle and colleagues speculated that nitrosyl iron com-
pounds and nitrosothiols may contribute to the tumoro-
genic potential of
in a
commentary on Kunhle’s article, Hogg speculated that
the sequestration of the "nitrosating potential" of the diet
as nitrosothiol or as nitrosyl iron may be a protective
mechanism that would limit the formation of DNA alky-
lating agents (42).

the diet (39). By contrast,

However, several arguments suggest that ATNC may be
important genotoxins. First, most NOC, such as nitrosa-
mines, nitrosamides, and nitrosoguanidines, can yield
alkylating agents during metabolism, and cause DNA
damage. For instance N-methyl-N-nitrosurea intrarectally
perfused induced G ! A transitions in K-ras in 30% of rat
colon carcinoma (43). In addition, nitrosated glycine deri-
vatives reacted with DNA to give rise to promutagenic and
toxic adducts including O6-methylguanine and O6-carbox-
ymethylguanine (44). O6-Carboxymethylguanine adducts
were found in stool exfoliated colonocytes from volunteers
eating red meat, with a correlation between the level of
adducts and of fecal ATNC, suggesting that ATNC are
genotoxic (45). Moreover, potassium diazoacetate, a stable
form of nitrosated glycine, was shown to induce mutations
in the p53 gene in a functional yeast assay (46). The
patterns of mutations were similar to the patterns observed
in human colon tumors. This supports the hypotheses that
nitrosation of compounds related to glycine contributes to
p53 mutations in humans, and that O6-carboxymethylgua-
nine adducts in exfoliated colorectal cells are related to
CRC (46).

Heme iron catalyzes the oxidation of polyunsaturated
fats



(lipid alkoxy radical) þ 

The polyunsaturated fatty acid residues of phospholi-
pids are extremely sensitive to oxidation. Lipid peroxida-
tion is initiated by free-radical attack of membrane lipids
and is catalyzed by heme with the following reaction:

ligands (heme oxiradical; ref. 47). The initial products
of unsaturated fatty acid oxidation are lipid hydroper-
oxides, but they are relatively short lived. They are either
reduced by glutathione peroxidase to unreactive fatty acid
alcohols or they react with metals to produce a variety of
reactive compounds such as epoxides and aldehydes. The
major aldehyde products of lipid peroxidation are mal-
ondialdehyde (MDA) and 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE;
ref. 48). These dietary lipid oxidation end products are
risk factors for several human diseases (for review, see
refs. 49, 50).

Malondialdehyde. MDA is formed by oxidation of poly-
unsaturated fatty acids with 2 or more double bonds.
MDA-induced DNA damage is mutagenic in bacterial,
mammalian, and human cells (51–53). MDA reacts with
DNA to form adducts with deoxyguanosine, deoxyadeno-
sine, and deoxycytidine (for review, see ref. 54). The major

Heme Iron and Colorectal Cancer

Figure 3. Catalytic effects of heme
on the formation of ATNC and lipid
peroxidation, and their inhibition.
Consequences for the
development of CRC. Heme
catalyzes the formation of ATNC
and lipid peroxidation
endproducts, which partially
explains the promoting effect of
red and processed meat on CRC.
The catalytic effects of heme can
be inhibited by trapping the heme
(calcium, chlorophyll). The
endogenous formation of ATNC is
inhibited by vitamins C and E, and
it appears that polyphenols can
inhibit lipid peroxidation.

DNA adduct formed by reaction of MDA with DNA is 1,N2-
malondialdehyde-deoxyguanosine (M1dG). M1dG was
detected in colorectal biopsies from normal mucosa of
162 participants in the United Kingdom FlexiScope Sig-
moidoscopy Screening Trial and the EPIC study (55). The
level of this adduct was modulated by dietary and lifestyle
habits, and there is to higher M1dG levels in subjects with
adenoma compared with adenoma-free subjects (P <
0.005; ref. 55).

4-Hydroxynonenal.

In contrast with MDA, 4-HNE is
weakly mutagenic but appears to be the main toxic
product of lipid peroxidation (Fig. 1). 4-HNE has power-
ful effects on signal transduction pathways and some of
its effects appear to be independent of DNA damage (48).
Indeed, 4-HNE present in fecal water can induce apop-
tosis and necrosis of human colon carcinoma cells
through caspase 3 activation (56). Mutations in the
adenomatous polyposis coli (Apc) gene on the chromosome
5q21 locus are considered to be one of the earliest events
in the initiation of CRC (57). Moreover, Apc mutation
was shown to reduce the level of caspases 3, 7, and 9 in
mouse colonocytes, leading to resistance to apoptosis
(58). An intestinal cell line derived from C57BL/6J mice
þ
(Apcþ/þ
) retained the hetero-
zygous Apc genotype and the disordered actin cytoskele-
ton network for the Apc Min/
cell line (59, 60). By

) and Min mice (Apc Min/
þ

exposing this cell line to fecal water of heme-fed rats or
to 4-HNE, Pierre and colleagues showed that apoptosis
was suppressed in Apc Min/
cells (61). The heterozygote
Apc mutation is thus a strong selective advantage for
colonic
cells exposed to a lipoperoxidation-related
genotoxic environment such as excess heme iron or 4-
HNE (61).

þ

In summary, heme catalyzes the formation of ATNC and
of lipid oxidation end products, which may explain the
promoting effects of red and processed meat on CRC.
However, the procarcinogenic effect of heme can be inhib-
ited by several molecules. First, calcium salts and chloro-
phyll can precipitate heme molecules and inhibit the
cytotoxic and hyperproliferative effect of heme in the rat
epithelium (17, 20–22, 62, 63). Moreover, the endogenous
formation of ATNC is inhibited by vitamins C and E, and
lipoperoxidation is inhibited by several polyphenols such
as quercetin, a-tocopherol, or red wine polyphenols (64–
68). The catalytic effects of heme and its inhibition are
summarized in Figure 3.

Conclusion

CRC is the leading cause of cancer death among non-
smokers in affluent countries, and its prevention is thus a
major goal for public health. Epidemiological studies

demonstrate a modest but significant and consistent
relation between red meat and processed meat intake
and CRC risk. The dietary recommendations are to reduce
red meat intake and to avoid processed meat intake (1).
However, meat is an important source of proteins, pro-
viding all essential amino acids, and it is an excellent
source of iron and zinc. Iron deficiency is the most
widespread nutritional disorder in the world, especially
among children and premenopausal women, and results
in iron deficiency anemia (1). Knowledge of the mechan-
ism of CRC promotion by meat may allow an alternative
prevention strategy to be developed: inhibiting red and
processed meat toxicity instead of stopping meat intake.
Among the hypotheses
explaining the association
between meat intake and the risk of CRC, the effect of
heme iron is supported by both epidemiological (Fig. 2)
and experimental evidence (Supplementary Fig. S1). Sev-
eral mechanisms may explain the effect of heme on CRC,
and the 2 major hypotheses are: (i) heme catalyzes the
endogenous formation of ATNC; and (ii) heme catalyzes
the peroxidation of dietary fats (Fig. 3). Calcium salts,
chlorophyll, vitamin C, and several polyphenols may

reduce these deleterious effects of heme. Specific recom-
mendations might be made, for example, "eat a yogurt
after your steak." Moreover, vitamins or polyphenols
could be added during the curing process. Ascorbic acid
is already added during the processing of processed meats
specifically to inhibit the formation of volatile NOC in
the meat (69). We expect that this will reduce the risk of
CRC without losing the benefit and the pleasure of eating
meat.

Low plasma B-vitamin levels and elevated homocysteine have been associated with cancer, cardiovascular
disease and neurodegenerative disorders. Common variants in FUT2 on chromosome 19q13 were associated
with plasma vitamin B12 levels among women in a genome-wide association study in the Nurses’ Health
Study (NHS) NCI-Cancer Genetic Markers of Susceptibility (CGEMS) project. To identify additional loci
associated with plasma vitamin B12, homocysteine, folate and vitamin B6 (active form pyridoxal 50-phosphate,
PLP), we conducted a meta-analysis of three GWA scans (total n 5 4763, consisting of 1658 women in NHS-
CGEMS, 1647 women in Framingham-SNP-Health Association Resource (SHARe) and 1458 men in SHARe).
On chromosome 19q13, we conﬁrm the association of plasma vitamin B12 with rs602662 and rs492602 (P-
value 5 1.83 3 10215 and 1.30 3 10214, respectively) in strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) with rs601338
(P 5 6.92 3 10215), the FUT2 W143X nonsense mutation. We identiﬁed additional genome-wide signiﬁcant
loci for plasma vitamin B12 on chromosomes 6p21 (P 5 4.05 3 10208), 10p12 (P-value52.87 3 1029) and
11q11 (P-value52.25 3 10210) in genes with biological relevance. We conﬁrm the association of the well-
studied functional candidate SNP 5,10-methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) Ala222Val (dbSNP
ID: rs1801133; P-value51.27 3 1028), on chromosome 1p36 with plasma homocysteine and identify an
additional genome-wide signiﬁcant locus on chromosome 9q22 (P-value52.06 3 1028) associated with
plasma homocysteine. We also identiﬁed genome-wide associations with variants on chromosome 1p36
with plasma PLP (P-value51.40 3 10215). Genome-wide signiﬁcant loci were not identiﬁed for plasma
folate. These data reveal new biological candidates and conﬁrm prior candidate genes for plasma homocys-
teine, plasma vitamin B12 and plasma PLP.

INTRODUCTION

One-carbon metabolism comprises a network of biochemical
reactions involved in the transfer of single-carbon moieties
essential for purine and thymidylate synthesis necessary for
maintenance of genomic integrity and remethylation of homo-
cysteine for S-adenosylmethionine (SAM)-dependent DNA

methylation reactions (1,2). Folate, a B-complex nutrient
from diet and supplements, donates methyl groups to generate
methionine from homocysteine. Plasma homocysteine (Hcy),
an integrated marker of one-carbon metabolism, is inversely
related to folate, vitamin B6 (3) and vitamin B12 and positively
related to high alcohol consumption (4,5). Vitamin B12 is a
necessary co-factor for the methionine synthase catalyzed

remethylation of Hcy into methionine. The biologically active
form of vitamin B6, pyridoxal 50-phosphate (PLP), catalyzes
Hcy transulfuration (6) and is involved in over 100 enzyme
reactions in the synthesis and catabolism of neurotransmitters
(7), amino acids, glycogen and lipids (8).

Epidemiologic studies have shown that

individuals with
reduced intake of
folate (found in fruits, vegetables and
legumes) or vitamin B6 (found in poultry, ﬁsh, meat, legumes,
nuts and potatoes) or vitamin B12 [found in liver, shellﬁsh, ﬁsh,
poultry, eggs and dairy products (9)] have an inverse relationship
with Hcy levels. The accumulation of Hcy leads to an intracellular
increase in S-adenosylhomocysteine (AdoHcy) and is an estab-
lished risk predictor of cardiovascular diseases (6,10– 16). In
addition,
individuals with inadequate intake of folate and
vitamin B12 are at an elevated risk of uracil misincorporation
into DNA and aberrant DNA methylation (17–20). Vitamin
B12 deﬁciency (21), related to poor intestinal B12 absorption (9)
or dietary deﬁciency, can lead to inactivation of methionine
synthase and is associated with pernicious anemia (22), cardio-
vascular disease (23– 25), cancer (26–32) and neurodegenerative
disorders (5,33–35). Plasma PLP levels are signiﬁcantly inver-
sely associated with risk of colorectal cancer in men (36) and
women (37).

Plasma Hcy is the integrated marker of the one-carbon
metabolism pathway, with a heritability estimate of 44%
(38)
[heritability estimate range 8 – 57% (38 – 43)]. Until
recently, common genetic variations reported to inﬂuence
plasma folate, vitamin PLP, vitamin B12 and Hcy were
focused on genes in the one-carbon metabolism pathway,
speciﬁcally the Ala222Val polymorphism (23,44) (45) in
5,10 methylene-THF reductase (MTHFR), associated with
reduced conversion of methylene-THF to methyl-THF
(46,47). We previously identiﬁed a genome-wide signiﬁcant
association between common variants in FUT2 and plasma
vitamin B12 levels in women (48). In a recent genome-wide
analysis of data pooled from three genome-wide association
study (GWASs) of 2931 persons and a replication study of
687 participants, Tanaka et al. (49) conﬁrmed this loci and
reported additional loci that met genome-wide signiﬁcance cri-
teria for PLP. In the current study, we report a meta-analysis
of three GWASs with 4763 participants (1658 women in
CGEMS, 1647 women in SHARe and 1458 men in SHARe)
and test for the association between 2 404 675 genotyped or
imputed SNPs with an R-sq . 0.3 (R-sq_hat estimates the
squared correlation between imputed and true genotypes and
allows us to assess imputation accuracy for markers with
many different allele frequencies) in each study and plasma
levels of Hcy, folate, vitamin B12 and PLP.

RESULTS
Genome-wide signiﬁcant associations of P-value , 5  1028
[corresponding to P , 0.05 corrected P-value after adjusting
for approximately 1 million independent loci (50)] were ident-
iﬁed in meta-analyses for
log-transformed plasma Hcy,
vitamin B12 and PLP. Age and the distributions of plasma
vitamin B12 and homocysteine in the study populations are
described in Table 1. As expected, plasma Hcy was found to
be inversely related to plasma levels of folate, vitamin B12

bExam 6 refers to Framingham Heart Study laboratory exam 6 measurements
(1995 – 1998). For all plasma, one-carbon metabolites exam 6 measurements
were used in this analysis because this exam had the largest sample size, and
laboratory measurements were conducted using assays comparable to NHS

Plasma homocysteine

The well-studied functional polymorphism in MTHFR
Ala222Val (also reported as MTHFR C677T), rs1801133, on
chromosome 1 [position (bp): 11,790,644] was associated

with plasma Hcy (P-value ¼ 1.27  1028; Fig. 1A; Table 2).

Participants with the Ala/Ala (G/G) variant had lower plasma
Hcy levels than variant carriers. Two other SNPs, rs12085006
[position (bp): 11,892,989] and rs1999594 [position (bp):
11,893,482], located 102 kb from MTHFR, had stronger associ-
ations with plasma Hcy (5.81  10210 and 6.24  10210,
respectively; Fig. 1A; Table 2). Participants homozygous for
the rs12085006 G and rs1999594 A alleles had higher Hcy
levels compared with variant carriers for each SNP. The
rs12085006 A allele is correlated with the MTHFR 222Val

allele (composite r2 ¼ 0.53; P , 0.0001) (51). After mutual

adjustment in a univariate regression model, both rs1285006
and MTHFR Ala222Val remained nominally statistically sig-

niﬁcantly associated with plasma Hcy (P ¼ 0.02 and 0.002,

respectively). Variant carriers of both MTHFR 222Val and the
A allele for rs12085006 had higher levels of plasma Hcy com-
pared with non-carriers. Similar results were obtained for
rs1999594. We also identiﬁed an association on chromosome
9 in the gamma-aminobutyric acid B-type receptor G-protein
coupled receptor 51 (GPR51) gene, rs10986018, with plasma

Hcy (P-value¼2.06  1028; Fig. 1A, Table 2). A SNP,
rs11041321 in SYT9, reported by Tanaka et al. (49) with a
P-value of 1.11  1024 in their joint analysis of GWAS
meta-analysis and replication study, had a P-value¼0.44 in

our meta-analysis data. The SNPs in CBS, CPS1, MUT and
NOX4 reported in the Women’s Genome Health Study by
Pare´ et al. (52) were not genome-wide signiﬁcant in our
plasma
CBS:
P-value¼6.30  1021; rs7422339 in CPS1: P-value¼4.18 
10-4; rs4267943 in MUT: P-value 6.43  1021; rs11018628
in NOX4: P-value¼4.35  1023).

Plasma folate

Overall, there were no genome-wide signiﬁcant associations
for plasma folate in the meta-analysis (Fig. 1B). The strongest
associations were in chromosome 2 in the FIGN gene,
and

rs982393 (P-value¼8.36  1028; data not
rs2119289 (P-value¼1.03  1027; data not shown). Although
MTHFR was observed (rs3737965, P-value¼6.90  1025;

not genome-wide signiﬁcant, a moderate signal for SNPs in

shown)

data not shown). As expected (53), the MTHFR Ala222Val
variant carriers had lower plasma folate compared with the

Ala/Ala variant (MTHFR Ala222Val P-value¼1.14  1023

from meta-analysis, data not shown). The composite linkage
disequilibrium (LD) with MTHFR Ala222Val and rs3737965
was 0.15 in our data. The rs1999594 SNP associated with
plasma folate in the report by Tanaka et al.
(49) had

P-value¼3.01  1023 in our analysis for plasma folate. The

rs153734 SNP in the PRICKLE gene, reported by Tanaka
et al. (49), was not associated with plasma folate in these

data (P-value¼0.44).

Plasma vitamin B12

Genome-wide signiﬁcant associations were identiﬁed on
chromosomes 6, 10, 11 and 19 for plasma vitamin B12
(Fig. 1C; Table 2). Two SNPs, in LD, in Methylmalonyl-CoA
mutase (MUT) on chromosome 6p21—rs9473558 SNP and
rs9473555 [chromosome position (bp): 49,520,392 and
49,517,446, respectively]—were genome-wide signiﬁcant in
the meta-analysis for plasma vitamin B12 (P-meta¼4.91 
1028, 4.05  1028 respectively, Fig. 1; Table 2). Participants
homozygous for the rs9473558 C and rs9473555 G alleles had
higher B12 levels compared with participants homozygous for
the major allele. We identiﬁed an association (P ¼ 2.87 
1029; Fig. 1C; Table 2) between rs1801222 in CUBN
(Cubilin) on chromosome 10p12 and plasma vitamin B12

The reported rs4654748 (49) SNP in NBPF3, upstream of

these data (composite r2 for rs1256335 and rs4654748 is
0.16, P , 0.0001).

DISCUSSION

We identiﬁed genome-wide signiﬁcant associations for plasma
homocysteine, plasma vitamin B12 and plasma PLP. SNPs in
chromosome 6p21, 10p12, 11q11 and 19q13 showed strong
signals for plasma vitamin B12. SNPs in chromosomes 1p36
and 9q22 were strongly associated with plasma homocysteine.
We identiﬁed genome-wide signiﬁcant associations between
SNPs in chromosome 1p36 and plasma PLP.

Plasma homocysteine

Chromosome 1p36. MTHFR is a key enzyme required for
DNA synthesis that catalyzes the irreversible transformation

of 5,10-MTHF into 5-MTHF (54). The TT variant alleles of
the well-known MTHFR 677 (amino acid change: MTHFR
Ala222Val) polymorphism are related to a 30% reduction in
enzyme activity (55). A decrease in MTHFR activity associ-
ated with the 222 Val/Val (677TT) polymorphism shifts the
folate pool, leading to an elevation in 5,10-methyleneTHF.
The MTHFR Ala222Val SNP results in a moderate (up to
15 – 19%) increase in mean Hcy levels between the Ala/Ala
and Val/Val variants (23), and this effect is greatly attenuated
in those individuals with mid-range to high folate levels (56).
Rs12085006 and rs1999594, located 102 kb from MTHFR,
had an even stronger association with plasma Hcy in our
meta-analysis. RS1999594 had a genome-wide signiﬁcant

association (P ¼ 8.5  10212) with plasma Hcy in the

Women’s Genome Health Study (WGHS), but only
rs180133 showed evidence for non-additive effects (52). The
rs1999594 SNP was reported by Tanaka et al. (49) to be
associated with plasma folate in a meta-analysis of 2931 par-

ticipants (P ¼ 1.12  1027), although the association did not

reach genome-wide signiﬁcance in their report on plasma
folate and was not reported for plasma Hcy. Given the
strong correlation between rs1999594 (or rs12085006) and
rs180133 and the modest evidence for association between
rs1999594 (or rs12085006) and plasma Hcy after adjusting
for MTHFR Ala222Val, we cannot conclude that these two
SNPs mark distinct loci associated with plasma Hcy.

Chromosome 9q22. We identiﬁed a genome-wide signiﬁcant
association between plasma Hcy and a variant in GPR51. Car-
riers of the rs10986018 T allele had lower plasma vitamin B12
compared with carriers of the CC variant. Expression of
GPR51 may be regulated by nicotine (57). Epidemiologic
studies have reported increased homocysteine levels
in
smokers compared with non-smokers (58 – 62). The associ-
ation with plasma Hcy and rs10986018 warrants future
study on plasma Hcy and effect modiﬁcation by smoking
status.

Plasma folate

We did not identify any genome-wide signiﬁcant association
with plasma folate in this meta-analysis, although the
MTHFR Ala222Val variant had the expected direction of
association (53,56), with a modest P-value. FHS SHARe
Exam 6 data available in dbGaP had the largest sample size
for all four plasma one-carbon metabolites and laboratory
assays comparable to the NHS CGEMS study population.
All NHS CGEMS participants had plasma folate measured
on blood drawn prior to folic acid fortiﬁcation (1989 – 1990).
However,
the Framingham SHARe laboratory exam 6
measurements were taken during 1995 – 1998. While the
majority of the SHARe participants included in this analysis
had measurements prior to the US mandate for folic acid for-
tiﬁcation in 1998, evidence suggests that the fortiﬁcation may
have started in 1996 – 1997. Pre-fortiﬁcation plasma folate
levels in the prior Framingham SHARe laboratory exam,
available in dbGaP, were measured using a microbial assay
and would not be equivalent to the HPLC assay used in the
NHS CGEMS data. We also recognize that there may also
be misclassiﬁcation due to folic acid supplementation.

Plasma vitamin B12

in the mitochondria,

Chromosome 6. MUT, located on chromosome 6p21, encodes
the mitochondrial enzyme methylmalonyl Coenzyme A (CoA)
mutase. MUT requires
5-prime-deoxyadenosylcobalamin
(AdoCbl, a coenzyme form of vitamin B12) to catalyze the iso-
merization of L-methylmalonyl – coenzyme A (CoA)
to
succinyl-CoA,
independent of folate
status. Mutations in methylmalonyl-CoA mutase, especially
in the C-terminus, result in methylmalonic aciduria (63 – 67).
A patient with the mut(-) MMA phenotype due to the MUT
Gly717Val variant was also homozygous for the His532Arg
(rs9473558) polymorphism (68). The T variant of rs9473558
has reduced vitamin B12 levels in our data and may be associ-
ated with decreased conversion of methylmalonyl CoA to suc-
cinyl CoA. The rs9473558 SNP in MUT was associated with
in the Women’s
Genome Health Study (WGHS) participants
(52). The
rs9473558 SNP was positively associated with plasma homo-

plasma homocysteine (P ¼ 2.1  10 – 7)

cysteine in the WGHS study (b¼ 0.020), but inversely associ-
ated with plasma vitamin B12
(b¼ 20.04), which is consistent with the inverse relationship
between homocysteine and vitamin B12. The expression of
MUT was associated with the rs9473555 SNP with a LOD
score ¼ 7.095 [enzyme activity for the G-allele is reduced

in our meta-analysis

by 0.42 standard deviation; mRNA by SNP browser 1-0-1
database (69)]. The preliminary association with rs9473558
or rs9473555 in the MUT gene and plasma vitamin B12
should be replicated in other studies. Future studies on the
relationship of
rs9473558 and MUT gene
expression is warranted.

Chromosome 10. Cubilin (CUBN) is located on chromosome
10p12.31. The 460 kd multiligand hydrophobic CUBN
protein binds to intrinsic factor-cobalamin (Cbl-IF) complexes
with a high afﬁnity and is expressed in both kidney and ileal
epithelial cells. Mutations in CUBN are associated with mega-
loblastic anemia and characterized by selective intestinal
vitamin B12 malabsorption (70). The P1297L mutation in
CUBN causes a 5-fold decrease of the binding domain afﬁnity
for Cbl-IF (the IF-Cbl binding region includes amino acids
928 – 1386). The rs1801222 (Ser253Phe) variant was associ-
ated with lower vitamin B12 levels in this study and may
decrease the binding and transport of vitamin B12 in the
ileum. Another SNP in CUBN reported by Tanaka et al. (49)
with a P-value of 1.11  1026, rs11254363, had a P-value
of 8.65  1025 in our meta-analysis. The neighboring gene,
located on 10p15.1 is a methyltransferase that
TRDMT1,
methylates
acid transfer RNA molecule
(tRNA(Asp))
(71). A recent study on spina biﬁda and
folate-related genes reported an association for different
SNPs in CUBN and TRDMT1 with increased serum RBC
folate levels in controls (72). Further research is warranted
to understand the LD pattern across the 305.3 kb CUBN
gene and the cis relationships of the genome-wide signiﬁcant
SNPs with CUBN and TRDMT1.

and the SHARe men data sets, we replicated our genome-wide
rs602662 (SHARe combined P ¼
signiﬁcant ﬁnding for
5.07  1028; Table 2 presents separate estimates and standard
error, by SHARe Men and Women) and in this meta-analysis
of CGEMS and SHARe data, we conﬁrm the association of
these SNPs with plasma vitamin B12. In this study of plasma
vitamin B12, we conﬁrm our previously reported hypothesis
that FUT2 W143X, a nonsense mutation (74) and determinant
of FUT2 secretor status, is the causal variant for the associ-

ation with plasma B12 levels (rs601338: P-value¼6.92 
10215). Individuals with the non-secretor status variant had
higher plasma vitamin B12 levels compared with carriers of
the secretor status genotypes. Reduced vitamin B12 absorption
(75 – 79) in carriers of the secretor genotype may be a conse-
quence of susceptibility to H. pylori infection compared with
individuals with the non-secretor genotype. The association
with rs602662 was replicated by an independent group (49)
with a P-value of 2.43  10212 in a meta-analysis of three
GWASs (n ¼ 2930 participants).

Plasma PLP

Mutations in the ALPL gene, on chromosome 1p36, are associ-
ated with hypophosphatasia. Increased circulating concen-
trations of PLP in all clinical forms of hypophosphatasia
have been reported by Whyte et al. (80,81). The ﬁndings
suggested that
tissue-non-speciﬁc alkaline phosphatase is
involved in vitamin B6 metabolism. The ALPL enzyme may
function as an ectoenzyme to regulate extracellular concen-
trations of PLP (80). The rs1256335 G allele had lower
plasma PLP levels compared with the homozygous A allele,
possibly due to increased hydrolysis of PLP (82). The
rs4654748 C allele, in the neuroblastoma breakpoint family,
member 3, (NBPF3, alternate name AE2) gene had lower
plasma PLP levels compared with the homozygous major
allele.

Comparability of plasma phenotypes in the study
population

The NHS and FHS study populations have comparable metab-
olite levels for conducting a meta-analysis of GWA data of
plasma one-carbon metabolites and the biomarker measure-
ment in these studies were all done in a single laboratory.
However, one limitation is that the NHS CGEMS participants
were all postmenopausal women, whereas SHARe Women
participants
included of both pre- and postmenopausal
women. Plasma Hcy is lower in premenopausal women than

men, but after menopause, homocysteine levels in women
increased to approach those in men, consistent with our data.
All NHS and the majority of the FHS blood samples for par-
ticipants in this analysis were collected prior to the introduc-
tion of folic acid fortiﬁcation of breads, cereals, ﬂours, corn
meal, pasta products, rice and other cereal grain products
sold in the USA (83,84). Therefore, the genetic variability
signal should not be attenuated by this recent environmental
inﬂuence.

In summary, for plasma vitamin B12, we replicated our
ﬁnding for FUT2 (48) and identiﬁed genome-wide signiﬁcant
SNPs in biological candidate genes: TCN1, a vitamin B12
binding protein; MUT, which converts methylmalonyl CoA
to succinyl CoA; and CUBN, the receptor for intrinsic factor-
vitamin B12 complexes. For plasma homocysteine, we
observed genome-wide signiﬁcant associations with the
MTHFR functional SNP Ala222Val and a possible new inde-
pendent locus 102 kb upstream of MTHFR. For plasma PLP,
we noted genome-wide signiﬁcant associations in ALPL.
These data reveal new biological candidates and conﬁrm
prior candidate genes for plasma homocysteine, plasma
vitamin B12 and plasma PLP.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Ethics statement

All participants provided written informed consent, and local
institutional review boards approved the study protocols.

Study populations

We conducted a meta-analysis of genome-wide data in 1658
women genotyped with the HumanHap500 as part of the
Cancer Genetic Markers of Susceptibility Project (CGEMS)
and in 1682 women genotyped with the Affymetrix 500K
mapping array and the Affymetrix 50K Supplementary array
as a part of the SNP Health Association Resource (SHARe
data set, part of NHLBI FHS) to identify novel loci that inﬂu-
ence plasma one-carbon metabolite levels. All participants
were of self-reported European ancestry.

The Nurses’ Health Study (NHS)

reporting medical

The NHS was initiated in 1976, when 121 700 US registered
nurses between the ages of 30 and 55 returned an initial ques-
tionnaire
baseline
health-related exposures. Every 2 years, follow-up question-
naires are mailed to the participants (questionnaire response
rate .90% for all follow-up cycles). Diet was assessed in
1986, 1990, 1994 and 1996 with a semiquantitative food fre-
quency questionnaire. Between 1989 and 1990, blood
samples and relevant sample collection information were col-
lected from 32 826 women.

The CGEMS project (http://www.cgems.cancer.gov) is an
NCI initiative to conduct genome-wide association studies
(GWAS) to identify genes involved in breast and prostate
cancer. The initial CGEMS scan, designed and funded only
to study the main effect of SNP variants on breast cancer
risk in postmenopausal women, has been completed (85).

A subset of the participants in the CGEMS project also has
been assayed for plasma vitamin B12. The NHS CGEMS par-
ticipants had similar laboratory measurement of the plasma
one-carbon metabolites as well as host characteristics and
blood draw features (fasting status and year and month of
blood draw).

10 study samples (27,37). No signiﬁcant differences in mean
levels of plasma homocysteine, folate, vitamin B12 or PLP
were detected by breast cancer case – control status in the
NHS. The mean coefﬁcient of variation for 75 pairs of repli-
cate 6.5% for folate, 7.9% for homocysteine, 7.3% for B12
and 7.2% for PLP (27).

Framingham Heart Study (FHS)

The FHS began in 1948 with the enrollment of two-thirds of
the adult population of Framingham, Massachusetts (86),
including 2873 women aged 28 – 62 years. In 1971, 5124 off-
spring of the original cohort members and offspring spouses
were enrolled in the Framingham Heart Study,
including
2641 women ranging in age from 12 to 60 years. A data set
consisting of repeated and highly accurate measurements of
many different phenotypes collected over multiple exam bien-
nial cycles is available for each participant. The NHLBI Fra-
mingham SNP-Health Association Resource (SHARe) is a
large-scale GWAS on the FHS original, offspring and third-
generation cohorts with data accessible to the research com-
munity (87). In the Framingham cohort,
the SNP Health
Association Resource (SHARe) project genotyped 9274 Cau-
casian participants with the Affymetrix 500K mapping array
and the Affymetrix 50K supplemental array (Affymetrix,
Santa Clara, CA, USA). The 8508 samples from these partici-
pants had a sample call rate 97% (88,89). Of the participants
from the Framingham original and offspring cohorts, with
measured plasma one-carbon metabolites at laboratory exam
6, between 1995 and 1998, the SHARe scan included 1647
(16) Caucasian women and 1458 Caucasian men. Exam 6
had the largest sample size for all four plasma one-carbon
metabolites and laboratory assays comparable to the NHS
CGEMS study population.

All assays were conducted at the Jean Mayer U.S. Depart-

case – control sets were always positioned next to each other,
in random order, in boxes sent to the lab and were assessed
in the same batch to minimize the impact of laboratory error
due to batch drift. Quality control (QC) samples were also sub-
mitted with each batch and were randomly placed throughout
the boxes (two assay batches were used for NHS CGEMS par-
ticipants). Laboratory technicians were blinded to case, control
and QC status of the samples. QC samples consisted of repli-
cates of two pools of plasma. One QC sample was assayed per

Reliability of laboratory assays of plasma levels

In an analysis of 188 NHS participants, the correlation coefﬁ-
cients between folate intake calculated from the 1980 food fre-
quency questionnaire and erythrocyte folate concentrations in
1987 were 0.55 for folate from foods and supplementation and
0.38 for folate from food only (18). Similar correlation coefﬁ-
cients were noted for plasma folate (0.55 for total folate; 0.35
for dietary folate) (18,27). The intraclass correlation coefﬁ-
cient over a 3-year period on 82 participants was 0.63 for
plasma folate, suggesting reproducibility of these measure-
ments over time.

Ilumina SNP genotyping and quality-control analysis

Genotyping in the CGEMS project was carried out using the
Illumina Inﬁnium Sentrix HumanHap550 bead chip, which
contains 556 566 SNPs derived from the HapMap phase I
and II data (85). The polymorphisms on the bead chip are
selected to be direct surrogates (R2, a measure of pair-wise
SNP correlation, .0.8) of more than 75% of the common
polymorphisms genotyped as part of the HapMap Phase II
project. Overall, genotyping success was 98.45% of the poss-
ible genotypes in the ﬁrst attempt and 99.27% after failed
samples were repeated. Quality control of genotyping reprodu-
cibility was 99.99%. SNPs with signiﬁcant deviations from
Hardy – Weinberg (HWE) proportions (5% of SNPs at the

level of P ¼ 0.05 and 1.28% at P ¼ 0.01) were not excluded

from the analysis, as the tests for association applied to
these data are valid in the presence of departure from HW pro-
portions. The NHS cases and controls included in CGEMS are
of self-reported European ancestry (85). Four samples (three
cases and one control) were removed because of intercontinen-
tal admixture. In the CGEMS data, we saw no evidence for
systematic bias in the distribution of P-values for analyses
with and without further adjustment for residual population
structure using four principal components of genetic variation
compatible with no confounding of SNP-metabolite associ-
ations due to population stratiﬁcation (85,91). A total of
1658 NHS participants had GWAS and plasma vitamin B12
data.

Affymetrix SNP genotyping and quality-control analysis

Genotyping in the SHARe study (88,89) was carried out using
the Affymetrix (Santa Clara, CA, USA) GeneChip Human
Mapping 500K mapping array and supplemental 50K
mapping array (HuGeneFocused50K) with gene-centric and
coding SNPs. The Human Mapping 500K Array Set is com-
prised of two arrays, each capable of genotyping on average
250 000 SNPs (approximately 262 000 for Nsp arrays and
238 000 for Sty arrays).

Association analyses were restricted to individuals with

Hardy – Weinberg equilibrium P-value of 1  1026, SNP call-
rate of 95% and minor allele frequency (MAF) of 0.01. After
cleaning the genotype data, 347 K SNPs were available for the
analysis.

Statistical methods

We tested the association between log-transformed plasma
one-carbon metabolite levels and each SNP using linear
regression adjusted for age. SNP genotypes were coded as
counts of minor alleles (additive coding) unless otherwise
speciﬁed. We adopted an additive coding because it has
nearly optimal power for a range of realistic genetic models,
with the exception of rare recessive effects, which we have
little power to detect (92). In CGEMS, we further adjusted
for principal components of genetic variation, calculated
with the EIGENSTRAT software (91).

The SHARe data were analyzed using linear mixed effects
models to account for residual familial correlation; aside
from ﬁxed effects (age, SNP genotype), this model includes
individual random effects with a correlation matrix equal to
the kinship matrix times a scalar variance parameter. These
analyses were implemented using the lmekin function in the
R package kinship.

We imputed SNP genotypes using the hidden Markov
model
implemented in MACH 1.0 (http://www.sph.umich
.edu/csg/abecasis/MACH/index.html) for each CGEMS and
SHARe separately. For the SHARe data, the hidden Markov
model was trained using unrelated founders (922 women and
692 biologically unrelated men); the ﬁtted model was then
used to infer missing genotypes for the remaining subjects.
The certainty of the imputation is dependent on the stretches
of haplotypes shared between the reference panel (HapMap
Phase II CEU population) and the study population. The
imputation result at each of the imputed SNPs, per study par-
ticipant, can be expressed as a set of three genotype probabil-
ities, that vary between 0 and 1 per genotype and sum to 1, or
as an ‘allele dosage’, which is deﬁned as the expected number
of copies of the minor allele at each SNP and varies between 0
and 2. In the CGEMS data, we evaluated both methods and
obtained comparable results for the genotype probabilities
and allele dosage methods. In the SHARe data, we evaluated
both methods for the genome-wide signiﬁcant associations
and obtained comparable results for the genotype probabilities
and allele dosage methods.

Genotyped and imputed SNPs with an R-sq_hat from
MACH .0.30 in both the CGEMS Illumina and SHARe
Affymetrix data were used for a meta-analysis (93)
to
examine the association between 2.5million polymorphisms
and the plasma metabolites. A ﬁxed-effect model was used to
pool the results for the NHS CGEMS, SHARe Women and
SHARe Men studies. Cochran’s Q statistic and tau-squared
were used to test for between-study heterogeneity, and the
I-squared statistic to quantify the proportion of total variation
due to heterogeneity will be calculated (94). We saw no evi-
dence for systematic bias in the distribution of P-values
from the meta-analyses (Supplementary Material, Fig. S1).
The P-for-heterogeneity is reported in Table 2. SAS PROC

GLM was used to test the independence of the estimates of
multiple SNPs in a model. Composite LD was calculated
according to the notation of Weir (51).

Our analyses do not explicitly account for the ascertainment
of subjects on the basis of primary disease (breast cancer for
the NHS CGEMS; Framingham SHARe data are from a
cohort study and not ascertained on disease). This approach
is appropriate, since our loci of interest are not associated
with primary disease evaluated in the CGEMS NHS partici-
pants (85,95). All P-values are based on two-sided tests. All
statistical analyses were performed with SAS (version 9.1;
SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA), R project
(http://www.
r-project.org) and PLINK (96).

Abstract

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified 38 larger genetic regions affecting classical blood lipid levels
without adjusting for important environmental influences. We modeled diet and physical activity in a GWAS in order to
identify novel loci affecting total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triglyceride levels. The Swedish (SE)
EUROSPAN cohort (NSE = 656) was screened for candidate genes and the non-Swedish (NS) EUROSPAN cohorts (NNS = 3,282)
were used for replication. In total, 3 SNPs were associated in the Swedish sample and were replicated in the non-Swedish
cohorts. While SNP rs1532624 was a replication of the previously published association between CETP and HDL cholesterol,
the other two were novel findings. For the latter SNPs, the p-value for association was substantially improved by inclusion of
environmental covariates: SNP rs5400 (pSE,unadjusted = 3.661025, pSE,adjusted = 2.261026, pNS,unadjusted = 0.047) in the SLC2A2
(Glucose transporter type 2) and rs2000999 (pSE,unadjusted = 1.161023, pSE,adjusted = 3.861024, pNS,unadjusted = 0.035) in the HP
gene (Haptoglobin-related protein precursor). Both showed evidence of association with total cholesterol. These results
demonstrate that inclusion of important environmental factors in the analysis model can reveal new genetic susceptibility
loci.

Introduction

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified more
than 38 larger genetic regions which influence blood levels of total
cholesterol
(LDL-C),
high-density lipoprotein cholesterol
(HDL-C) and triglycerides
(TG) [1–3]. These studies modeled basic anthropometric con-
founders, such as sex and age, while leaving out
important

low-density lipoprotein cholesterol

(TC),

environmental influences, such as diet and activity. This strategy is
statistically suboptimal since the unexplained variation in the
phenotype can increase the measurement error and as a result
require larger sample sizes to detect a significant effect. Manolio
[4] argued strongly for modeling of environmental covariates in
GWAS and recommended lipid levels as a paradigmatic
phenotype for studying the genetic and environmental architecture
of quantitative traits.

Author Summary

In this article we report a genome-wide association study
on cholesterol
levels in the human blood. We used a
Swedish cohort to select genetic polymorphisms that
showed the strongest association with cholesterol levels
adjusted for diet and physical activity. We replicated
several genetic loci
in other European cohorts. This
approach extends present genome-wide association stud-
ies on lipid levels, which did not take these lifestyle factors
into account, to improve statistical results and discover
novel genes. In our analysis, we could identify two genetic
loci in the SLC2A2 (Glucose transporter type 2) and the HP
(Haptoglobin-related protein precursor) gene whose ef-
fects on total cholesterol have not been reported yet. The
results show that inclusion of important environmental
factors in the analysis model can reveal new insights into
genetic determinants of clinical parameters relevant for
metabolic and cardiovascular disease.

In order to explore the usefulness of including both environ-
mental and genetic factors in the analysis model, we used lipid
measurements from the EUROSPAN study, comprising 3,938
individuals for whom genome-wide SNP data (NSNP = 311,388)
were available [5]. We measured daily intake of food and physical
activity at work and at leisure and modeled the influence of those
environmental covariates on serum lipid levels in a GWAS. First,
data from the Northern Sweden Population Health Study
(NSPHS) were used as a discovery cohort to screen for SNPs
that displayed the lowest p-values when the model was adjusted for
environmental covariates. We then used the other, non-Swedish
EUROSPAN cohorts for replication of our strongest associations
in a candidate gene association study (CGAS).

shows

We chose a population living in northern Sweden for the
selection of candidate loci because it
strong natural
heterogeneity in certain lifestyle factors (e.g. diet, activity), but
homogeneity in other environmental aspects such as climate [6].
Whereas one group is living a modern, sedentary lifestyle found
also in the southern part of Sweden and other western European
countries, a subgroup of Swedes follows a traditional, semi-
nomadic way of life based on reindeer herding. Reindeer herders
typically show higher intake of game meat (reindeer, moose),
which has a high protein and low fat content, and lower intake of
non-game meat,
lesser
differences. They also exert more physical activity at work to tend
their reindeer herds, but less activity at leisure [7].

Results

Exploratory GWAS in NSPHS

We performed a GWAS with a lifestyle-adjusted model which
included not only sex and age, but also daily intake of game meat,
non-game meat, fish, milk products, physical activity at work and
at leisure as covariates. We focused on the 0.05% of all SNPs with
the lowest p-values
in the diet- and activity-adjusted model
(corresponding to about 150 SNPs per lipid). For total cholesterol,
88 of these were located in a gene and 14 in genes that have been
associated with energy metabolism (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.
gov/omim/). For LDL-C, 65 SNPs were located in a gene, of
which 8 were functionally relevant. Several of the SNPs for LDL-
C were identical with those affecting total cholesterol, as expected
from the high correlation (r = 0.91) between both phenotypes. For
HDL-C, SNP rs2292883, located in the MLPH gene (Melanophi-
lin), showed a genome-wide significant p-value (p = 1.06610207).

Modeling of Environmental Effects in GWAS

69 SNPs for HDL-C were located in a gene and 14 of those genes
were reported as having a metabolic effect. Finally,
for
triglycerides, 63 SNPs were located in a gene, but only 4 SNPs
in genes with a functional annotation of interest (Table 1 and
Table S1A, S1B, S1C, S1D).

P-value changes

In order to evaluate the effect of including diet and activity
covariates in the association analysis, we overlaid the p-values in
the Manhattan plots from the NSPHS for the unadjusted and
adjusted GWAS models (Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4).
More refined GWAS results separating the effect of adjusting for
either diet or physical activity are presented in Figure S1A, S1B,
S1C, S1D; and Figure S2A, S2B, S2C, S2D. As expected, the
p-values for a number of SNPs were sensitive to the inclusion of
both diet and activity covariates in the model. We matched the
0.05% SNPs with the lowest p-values (top SNP list) between the
unadjusted and the adjusted model. For TC, 83 (53%) SNPs were
found in both top SNP lists. Those lists contained 102 (64%)
identical SNPs for LDL-C and 103 (65%)
for HDL-C. The
analyses resulted in the same 74 (47%) top SNPs for TG levels
(Table S1A, S1B, S1C, S1D). Finally, we compared the p-value
changes of the resulting 39 candidate SNPs that are located in
genes with a metabolic effect between the diet and activity-
adjusted (full) model and the unadjusted (restricted) model
resulting in an up to 27-fold p-value decrease (Table 1).

A food- and activity-adjusted candidate gene association study of
the final 39 candidate SNPs in the Scottish (SC) sample (N = 714) was
applied using similar lifestyle covariates (Table 2; Table S1E, S1F,
S1G, S1H; Table S2). We replicated the effect of rs2000999
(pSC,unadj = 6.16610203, pSC,adj = 4.33610203)
in the HP gene
(Haptoglobin-related protein Precursor) on TC level and the effect
of
in
CETP (Cholesteryl ester transfer protein) on HDL-C. In the Swedish
cohort (SE), the unadjusted genetic effect of rs2000999 in the HP
gene is equivalent to a moderately large difference in average TC
level of 20.21 mg/dl between the homozyguous genotypes (Mean-

with a large, unadjusted difference in HDL-C level of 9.99 mg/

We also performed an unadjusted candidate gene analysis of
the 39 candidate SNPs in all non-Swedish (NS) EUROSPAN
cohorts

in a meta-analysis
(Table 2; Table S1I, S1J, S1K, S1L). We confirmed the effects
of rs5400 (pNS = 4.68610202) in SLC2A2 on TC. We again found
that rs2000999 (pNS,unadj = 3.5461022)
in HP influences TC
levels and rs1532624 (pNS,unadj = 2.87610220) in CETP (Choles-
teryl ester transfer protein) affects HDL-C levels. The unadjusted
genetic effect of rs5400 is equivalent
to a moderately large
difference in mean TC level of 27.11 mg/dl between homozyguous

Discussion

Environmental covariates may either act as moderators,
mediators or even suppressors, thereby affecting the discovery of
genetic susceptibility loci
[8,9]. Therefore, we conducted a
GWAS, modeling genetic and important environmental effects,
such as food intake and physical activity, on serum levels of
classical lipids. To our knowledge, this is the first GWAS on blood
lipid levels modeling environmental factors, in particular major
food categories and physical activity, in international cohorts. Our
analysis replicated one known locus in the CETP gene [1] and
in the SLC2A2 and HP gene,
identified two other gene loci
respectively,
involved in energy metabolism but not previously
reported to be associated with cholesterol levels.

SLC2A2 encodes the facilitated glucose transporter member 2
(GLUT-2, Solute carrier family 2) and is predominantly expressed
in the liver. Mice deficient in GLUT-2 are hyperglycemic and
have elevated plasma levels of glucagon and free fatty acids [10].

Mutations in GLUT-2 cause the Fanconi-Bickel syndrome (FBS)
characterized by hypercholesterolemia
and hyperlipidemia
[11,12]. Cerf [13] argued that a high-fat diet causes a decreased
expression of the GLUT-2 glucose receptor on b-cell islets. As a
result, glucose stimulation of insulin exocytosis is impaired causing
hyperglycemia, a clinical hallmark of type 2 diabetes. In addition,
Kilpelainen et al. [14] found that physical activity moderates the
genetic effect of SLC2A2 on type 2 diabetes. These studies suggest
that these lifestyle factors could have masked genetic effects in
previous, unadjusted GWAS. This is emphasized by the strong
increase in statistical significance of the SLC2A2 polymorphisms
after adjusting for diet and physical activity, indicating that the
examined lifestyle factors modified the effect of this gene. Our
supplemental
show that physical activity markedly
moderated the genetic effect on total cholesterol.

the Haptoglobin-related Protein
Precursor (Hp), which binds hemoglobin (Hb) to form a stable
Hp-Hb complex and, thereby, prevents Hb-induced oxidative
tissue damage. Asleh et al. [15] identified severe impairment in the
ability of Hp to prevent oxidation caused by glycosylated Hb.
Diabetes is also associated with an increase in the non-enzymatic
glycosylation of serum proteins, so these authors suggested that
there is a specific interaction between diabetes, cardiovascular
disease and the Hp genotype. It results from the increased need of
rapidly clearing glycosylated Hb-Hp complexes from the suben-

lipoprotein to form the atherogenic oxidized low-density lipopro-

We also observed a highly significant association between
rs1532624 in CETP and HDL-C levels. The CETP protein
catalyzes
insoluble cholesteryl esters among
lipoprotein particles. Variation in CETP is known to affect the
susceptibility to atherosclerosis and other cardiovascular diseases
[16]. Adjustment for diet and physical activity in our model caused
an increase of the p-value of this SNP. Our supporting results
indicate that the genetic effect is mediated by diet or by physical
activity in a similar way.

This study also has some limitations. First, we are aware that our
candidate gene association approach covers only a very small
fraction of all genomic loci, which is one of the potential reasons
why some classical lipid-influencing genes, such as APOE, are not
represented in our candidate SNP list. Therefore, our approach is
not comprehensive and may have failed to identify other relevant
lifestyle-sensitive genetic variants. Nonetheless, we decided to apply
this approach to make the best out of the available lifestyle data.
Second, our study provides only limited information on the role of
individual lifestyle factors for a genetic variant. However, in this
study we aimed at amplifying genetic effects by adjusting for a
maximum amount of environmental variance in a single model and,

therefore, we neglected some of these aspects here. Third, we did
not model genetic covariates in known lipid-relevant genes which
may also moderate the effect of other genetic predictors. This is due
to the focus of this paper on gene-environment relationships.

In summary, we have demonstrated that modeling environmen-
tal factors, in particular major food categories and physical activity,
can improve statistical power and lead to the discovery of novel
susceptibility loci. Such models also provide an understanding of the
complex interplay of genetic and environmental factors affecting
human quantitative traits. Inclusion of environmental covariates
represents a much needed next step in the quest to model the
complete environmental and genetic architecture of complex traits.

consortium (http://www.eurospan.org). All
include a
comprehensive collection of data on family structure,
lifestyle,
blood samples for clinical chemistry, RNA and DNA analyses,
medical history, and current health status. All participants gave
their written informed consent [18]. A brief description of each
population is given below:

studies

The Northern Swedish Population Health Study (NSPHS) represents a
cross-sectional study conducted in the community of Karesuando
in the subartic region of the County of Norrbotten, Sweden, in
2006 [5]. This parish has about 1500 eligible inhabitants of whom
740 participated in the study. The final sample consisted of 309
men and 347 women who were aged between 14 and 91 years.
The inclusion of diet and activity covariates in the analytical model
and according missing values reduced the effective sample size by
less than 5%.

The Orkney Complex Disease Study (ORCADES) is a longitudinal
study in the isolated Scottish archipelago of Orkney [19].
Participants from a subgroup of ten islands (N = 719) were used
for the presented analysis. The sample comprised 334 men and
385 women aged between 18 and 100 years. The inclusion of diet

and activity covariates in the analytical model and according
missing values reduced the effective sample size by less than 5%.
The VIS study is a cross-sectional study in the villages of Vis
and Komiza on the Dalmatian island of Vis, Croatia, and was
conducted between 2003 and 2004 [20–22]. 795 participants who
had both genotype and phenotypic data available were analysed.
This cohort included 328 men and 467 women with an age
between 18 and 93 years.

The Microisolates in South Tyrol Study (MICROS)

is a cross-
sectional study carried out in the villages of Stelvio, Vallelunga,
and Martello, Venosta valley, South Tyrol, Italy, from 2001 to
2003 [23]. The 1,097 participants (475 males, 622 females, age
between 18 and 88 years) presented in this study are those for
whom both relevant genotype and phenotype data were available.
The Erasmus Rucphen Family Study (ERF) is a longitudinal study
on a population living in the Rucphen region, the Netherlands,
in the 19th century [24]. Fasting total cholesterol, HDL
cholesterol and triglyceride levels were available. LDL choles-
terol was estimated using the Friedewald formula [25]. The 918
individuals included in this study consisted of the first series of
participants with 354 men and 564 women aged between 18
and 92 years.

Diet

In the NSPHS cohort, we collected data with a food frequency
questionnaire based on the Northern Sweden 84-item Food
Frequency Questionnaire (NoS-84-FFQ) [26]. We included in the
questionnaire several items on foods specific for the lifestyle in this
geographic region, in particular on game consumption (reindeer,
moose). The answer options consisted of an 11-point format:
0 = ‘‘Never’’, 1 = ‘‘less than 1 time per month’’, 2 = ‘‘1 to 3 times
per month’’, 3 = ‘‘1 time per week’’, 4 = ‘‘2 to 4 times per week’’,
5 = ‘‘5 to 6 times per week’’, 6 = ‘‘1 time per day’’, 7 = ‘‘2 to 3
times per day’’, 8 = ‘‘4 to 5 times per day’’, 9 = ‘‘6 to 8 times per
day’’, 10 = ‘‘9 to 10 times per day’’. The questionnaire was applied
in electronic format by a trained study nurse as an interviewer. For
each food item we calculated daily intake in gram per day as a
standardized unit of measurement and aggregated the items to
food categories, such game meat, non-game meat, fish, and dairy
products. We evaluated the construct validity (known-groups
validity) of the added items on game consumption in the NoS-84-
FFQ questionnaire. We compared reindeer herders (N = 94) versus
non-reindeer herders (N = 505). We observed highly significant,
large effect sizes in men (ES = 1.25, p = 9.7610204) and women
(ES = 1.15, p = 2.9610205) in the expected direction correspond-
ing with an approximately three times higher consumption of
absolute overall game intake in reindeer herders compared to
others. A similar approach was used for the measurement and
analysis of dietary data collected with a food frequency
questionnaire in the Scottish cohort (Table S2).

Physical activity

In the NSPHS cohort, we used two self-report scales to measure
overall physical activity at work and at leisure. The Work Activity
Scale (WAS, 6 items) addresses typical occupational physical
activities: sitting, standing, walking, lifting, and general indicators
of physical activity, i. e. sweating and tiredness after work. The
Leisure Activity Scale (LAS, 4 items) asks for various typical
freetime activities such walking, cycling, other sporting activities,
and sweating as a general
indicator of physical activity.
Participants reported the frequency of each activity on a 5-point
rating scale (1 = ‘‘never’’, 2 = ‘‘seldom’’, 3 = ‘‘sometimes’’, 4 = ‘‘of-
ten’’, and 5 = ‘‘always’’). Both scales showed satisfying internal
consistency with Cronbach’s a(WAS) = 0.73 and Cronbach’s
a(LAS) = 0.70. A similar approach was used for the measurement
and analysis of data on physical activity collected with a self-report
questionnaire in the Scottish cohort (Table S2).

Statistical analysis

Model selection. Sex and age are chosen as

standard
moderators of medical outcomes. Food and physical activity
covariates have been selected based on findings on natural
variation in lifestyle factors in this (data not presented) and other
[7] northern Swedish populations between a modern, sedentary
and a traditional,
semi-nomadic lifestyle based on reindeer
herding. Mostly significant associations between diet and activity
covariates and lipid levels were found in the examined Swedish
EUROSPAN cohort in the following ranges: r = [20.01;0.12] (p =
[1.28610202;0.16]) for game meat, r = [20.13;20.05] (p = [8.636

leisure
(Table S3). We finally selected sex, age, game meat, non-game
meat, fish, dairy products, physical activity at work, and physical
activity at leisure as covariates in our diet- and activity-adjusted
model (‘‘adjusted’’ model) in the Swedish EUROSPAN sample.
Sex and age were used as covariates in the ‘‘unadjusted’’ model.
We tested whether the inclusion of those covariates in the
explanatory model led to a statistical significant improvement of
the goodness of model fit compared to a restricted model by
applying a maximum likelihood ratio (MLR) test. We inferred a
significant better model fit of the full model if the difference of the
x2 value between both models had an equal or lower probability
than p = 0.05 (one-sided, upper tail) on a x2 distribution with k
degrees of freedom. The degrees of freedom k are equal to the
difference of the number of parameters in each model. The
difference of x2 values between both models
is calculated
according to the following formula with MLE indicating the
maximum likelihood estimates per model: x2(rest2full) = 22
(log10(MLErest)2log10(MLEfull)). The comparison of the goodness
of fit between the unadjusted and the diet- and activity-adjusted
full model, using a MLR test, showed a statistically significant
improvement for all four lipid traits (TC: x2

the variance explained by lifestyle factors with physical activity
being responsible for the rest. GWAS results for models adjusted

was based on a local

Candidate gene association analysis. The same statistical
approach was used for association analysis of candidate loci with a
local type I error of a = 0.05. No Bonferroni adjustment was
applied to protect against a inflation since this method would be
biased for the following reasons. The applied selection procedure
for candidate loci makes the assumption of a global null hypothesis
highly unlikely. Additionally, the phenotypes and some of the
genotypes are highly correlated decreasing the number of
independent tests. Instead all confirmatory tests are reported to
allow the reader to evaluate the overall significance of the findings
[29].

Relatedness. l coefficients of lifestyle-adjusted genome-wide
analysis varied in a low range between 1.00 and 1.04 in the
Swedish cohort (see QQ-plots, Figures S3A, S3B, S3C, S3D, and
Figure S4A, S4B, S4C, S4D) and between 1.00 and 1.01 in the
Scottish cohort across all lipid traits. l values for the unadjusted
model used in the other three EUROSPAN cohorts did not exceed
1.01. These values indicate that our statistical model adequately
handled relatedness in our pedigree-based samples since deflation
of l values is expected after correction for family structure.

Effect of White Versus Red Meat on Endogenous N-Nitrosation in the
Human Colon and Further Evidence of a Dose Response1

Sheila Anne Bingham,2 Roisin Hughes and Amanda Jane Cross

ABSTRACT N-Nitroso compounds are found in the colon and are formed endogenously because amines and
amides are produced by bacterial decarboxylation of amino acids in the large gut. They can be N-nitrosated in the
presence of a nitrosating agent. To test the hypothesis that increased nitrogenous residues from red meat would
increase endogenous N-nitrosation, thus accounting for the epidemiologic association between red meat con-
sumption and colorectal cancer, we fed increased levels of red meat and measured apparent total N-nitroso
compounds (ATNCs) in fecal samples in a series of studies of volunteers maintained under controlled conditions.
A result of these studies is that we have shown a consistent dose response to red meat consumption. Fiber, in the
form of vegetables, bran or resistant starch, does not reduce the level of ATNCs formed, although transit time is
reduced and fecal weight are increased. Here we show that the equivalent amount (420 – 600 g) of meat as white
meat has no effect on fecal ATNCs in 12 volunteers (P ⫽ 0.338). At dosages of 0, 60, 120, 240 and 420 g of red
meat/d, mean levels of ATNC output are highly correlated with dose of meat: for concentration ATNC versus dose
of meat in g/d, r ⫽ 0.972, ␤ ⫽ 0.252 ng/g (SE 0.035); for total ATNC output versus dose of meat in g/d, r ⫽ 0.963,
␤ ⫽ 2.605 ␮g/d (SE 0.419). The effects of nonmeat protein and of heme on increased N-nitrosation and the
genotoxic effects of the ATNCs produced are presently being investigated.

Up to 80% of colorectal cancer cases have been attributed
to diet, suggesting that this cancer, the second most common
in Western countries, is a preventable disease (1). Armstrong
and Doll (2) attributed much of the international variation in
large bowel cancer incidence among countries to dietary dif-
ferences, especially meat and fat consumption. If meat is
associated with increased risk, lower rates for cancer would be
expected in vegetarians; in a meta-analysis of ﬁve cohorts,
non–meat eaters were not at lower risk than meat eaters (3).
However, in the largest study of these vegetarians versus meat
eaters, meat was associated with increased risk of colorectal
cancer (3,4). Two systematic reviews of meat consumption in
relation to colorectal cancer incidence were recently pub-
lished. In 13 prospective studies an increase of 100 g all meat
or red meat was associated with a signiﬁcant 12–17% increased
risk of colorectal cancer, and a signiﬁcant 49% increased risk
was found for a daily increase of 25 g processed meat (5). In 34

case-control studies and 14 cohort studies average relative risk
was 1.35 [conﬁdence interval 3(CI 1.21–1.51)] for red meat
and 1.31 (CI 1.13–1.51) for processed meat (nitrite treated,
cured or smoked, including lunch meats) and meat products
and there was no signiﬁcant association with total meat (6). In
contrast, white meat consumption has been associated with
decreased risk in two prospective studies (7,8).

One explanation for the association between meat and
colorectal cancer is the presence of N-nitroso compounds
(NOCs) formed endogenously within the colon. NOCs are
formed because the amines and amides produced primarily by
bacterial decarboxylation of amino acids can be N-nitrosated
in the presence of a nitrosating agent (9,10). A number of
facultative and anaerobic colonic bacteria can catalyze the
formation of NOCs at optimum pH 7.5 (11–13). In the
anaerobic large bowel, nitrate is reduced during dissimilatory
nitrate metabolism by the colonic ﬂora to nitrite from which
nitrosating agents may be formed. Supplements of nitrate have
therefore been shown to elevate fecal NOCs (14). N-Nitrosa-
tion in the colon has been demonstrated in animals and shown
to be dependent on the presence of gut ﬂora (15).

Meat increases the level of nitrogenous residues reaching
the colon (16) so that meat might be expected to increase
colonic level of NOCs. We previously showed that fecal NOC

We have been unable to show an effect of white meat on
endogenous N-nitrosation but have only studied two individ-
uals so far (17). Hence the effect of white meat in 12 individ-
uals, at two different levels, is reported here. In addition, the
effect of 120 g red meat on endogenous N-nitrosation in nine
volunteers is added to previously published data showing a
dose-response effect to 60, 240 and 480 g of red meat/d (19).

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Subjects and diets. Eighteen healthy male volunteers (aged
24 –74 y) were studied in a metabolic suite. During this time only food
that was provided from a standardized menu of normal food was
permitted to be eaten. All diets were constant in fat and nonstarch
polysaccharide (dietary ﬁber) and adjusted for the energy needs for
each subject with extra bread, low-fat margarine and marmalade.
Energy requirements ranged from 10 to 12.5 MJ/d. In protocol 1,
seven subjects were studied for three 10-d dietary periods of 60 g red
meat, 600 g red meat (as beef and pork) and 600 g white meat (as
chicken, turkey or white cod). In protocol 2, ﬁve subjects were
studied for three 15-d periods. The diets were the same as in protocol
1 except that 420 g red and white meat rather than 600 g was used.
In protocol 3, nine subjects were fed 60 and 120 g red meat for 15 d
each. To equalize the energy content of the diets, a glucose polymer
drink and cream were substituted for meat on the 60- and 120-g diets.
All other items of food on each diet of the protocols were the same.
Deionized water was given throughout for drinking and used in
cooking to keep nitrate intake constant. Diets were randomly as-
signed by using a crossover design and subjects were their own
control. Permission for the studies was given by the Dunn Human
Nutrition Unit and Addenbrookes Hospital ethics committees.

Protocols. All fecal samples were collected and stored at ⫺20°C
except for those collected on days 8 –10 in protocol 1 and 13 and 14
in protocols 2 and 3. These samples were processed to prepare
homogenates within 20 min of excretion. Each sample was diluted

fourfold with ultrapure deionized water, homogenized in a stomacher
(Colworth 3500, Seward) for 20 min and centrifuged at 4500 rpm for
10 min. Each supernatant was ﬁltered, distributed into aliquots and
stored at ⫺20°C. Fecal homogenates were analyzed for NOCs and
nitrite by the release of nitric oxide after chemical denitrosation via
thermal energy analysis (21). NOCs detected by this group-selective
method are referred to as apparent total NOCs (ATNCs). All sam-
ples collected during the study were weighed and radiographed, and
recoveries of radiopaque fecal markers (22) were noted.

RESULTS

In protocol 1, 96% of the total fecal markers administered
were recovered (i.e., 4% of markers were present in specimens
not collected after the experimental period). In protocol 2, the
mean number of markers recovered in the fecal samples by
x-ray analysis was 99.0%, and the mean marker recovery from
each volunteer ranged from 98.8% to 99.2%. In protocol 3,
mean marker recovery was 97.7% (range 99.9 –99.6%).

The mean results for all 12 subjects from protocols 1 and 2
are shown in Table 1. Both the concentration of ATNCs and
the output per day were signiﬁcantly higher when the diets
with 420 – 600 g red meat were fed compared with the diet
with 60 g meat (P ⫽ 0.001, P ⫽ 0.009, respectively). However,
ATNC levels when the diets with 420 – 600 g white meat were
fed were not signiﬁcantly different from the low-meat diet (P
⫽ 0.338 and P ⫽ 0.408, respectively, for concentration and
output per day) and were signiﬁcantly lower than those ob-
tained with the diet with 420 – 600 g red meat (P ⫽ 0.014, P
⫽ 0.009, respectively, for concentration and output).

Figure 1 shows individual values of fecal ATNC concen-
tration as a the percentage change from the 60-g red meat diet.
All subjects increased their fecal ATNC concentration on the
high–red meat diet, but there was a large individual variation
in response. Four
subjects exhibited a fourfold increase,
whereas eight subjects increased levels by 1–2.5 times. ATNC
levels in all subjects decreased on changing from the high–red
meat diet to the high–white meat diet to levels found on the
low-meat diet except for two subjects consuming the 600-g
high–white meat diet in whom levels increased on changing to
the white meat diet.

SUPPLEMENT

fecal ATNC excretion during the study was due to endogenous
intestinal formation. This formation is not due to an increase
in the amount of nitrosating agents, such as nitrate, because
nitrate levels have been kept constant throughout to avoid
interference from this factor. An equivalent amount of protein
as white meat in this study had no effect; therefore increased
endogenous production of nitric oxide from oxidation by nitric
oxide synthase of the extra L-arginine present in the high-meat
diets is unlikely to account for any increase (23). The 420-g
red meat diet would have provided ⬃7.3 g arginine compared
with 1.04 g from the 60-g diet (24).

Despite the consistent response to meat, there is substantial
individual variation in the extent of response (Fig. 1). This
individual variation remains despite the highly controlled
conditions under which studies are carried out. The individual
variation may arise from individual differences in gut ﬂora,
with high responders harboring high populations of nitric
oxide–producing bacteria. Alternatively,
individual differ-
ences in iron or protein absorption would alter the amount of
precursors available for N-nitrosation entering the colon. Iron
is required for nitrate reductase activity, which is responsible
for bacterially mediated N-nitrosation (11–13).

Although red meat resulted in the expected increase in
endogenous N-nitrosation in this study, the same amount of
white meat had no effect in 10 of 12 volunteers; therefore
mean fecal ATNC levels were not signiﬁcantly different from
those found in a diet with 60 g of meat. In vitro work has
shown that the heme proteins myoglobin and hemoglobin in
meat react with nitric oxide under anaerobic conditions to
form nitrosating agents with the ability to nitrosate phenol
(25). Under certain conditions, hemes are known to be nitro-
sated and act as nitrosating agents (26). The formation of
N-nitrosoarginine by heme enzymes under anaerobic condi-
tions was also demonstrated (27). Red meat is a much richer
source of heme iron than is white meat; therefore the lack of
effect of white meat may be due to a comparative absence of
heme. Present studies are investigating the effect of heme on
endogenous N-nitrosation (28).

Many classes of NOC have been identiﬁed, including ni-
trosamines, nitrosamides and nitrosoguanidines, and a number
of these are known to cause DNA damage after the formation
of alkylating agents during NOC metabolism. Methylnitro-
sourea was shown to induce G3 A transitions at codons 12

␮g/d (SD 125) on the high-meat diet (P ⫽ 0.209). Figure 2
shows mean values for fecal NOC concentration using com-
bined results from those already published (19) and the results
from these nine individuals studied in protocol 3 (n ⫽ 17 for
the 60-g level). Although differences between the 60- and
120-g levels in protocol 3 were not signiﬁcant, mean levels of
fecal ATNCs on the 120-g red meat diet were intermediate
between those obtained from the 60-g and 240-g diets (Fig. 2).
Mean levels of NOC output were highly correlated with dose
of meat: for ng of ATNCs/g versus dose of g of meat/d, r
⫽ 0.972, b ⫽ 0.252 (SE 0.035), and for ␮g of ATNCs/d versus
dose of g of meat/d, r ⫽ 0.963, b ⫽ 2.605 (SE 0.419).

DISCUSSION

The inﬂuence of red meat on fecal ATNC excretion has now
been shown in more than 50 healthy male volunteers, all of
whom were studied in this study and four previous studies from
our laboratory in a metabolic suite where diet could be carefully
controlled (17–20). The direction of increase with increasing
meat is consistent in nearly all individuals. Furthermore, Figure 2
shows there is a dose response that occurs at normal levels of
120 g of meat/d in addition to the higher levels of 240 and 420 g/d
published elsewhere (19). Under these controlled conditions, the
dose of red meat was highly predictive of average fecal ATNCs,
with R2 values of 0.97 and 0.96 for concentration and output per
day, respectively. At the higher levels of meat consumption,
concentrations of ATNCs are of the same order of magnitude as
the concentration of tobacco-speciﬁc NOCs in cigarette smoke
(11,17). We previously showed that fermentable carbohydrate
does not change fecal NOC output (17,18,20). In this study, the
nonstarch polysaccharide (ﬁber) contents of the diets were the
same and diet had no effect on fecal weight and mean transit time
(Table 1).

A high–red meat diet containing 600 g of meat/d provides
only 13 ␮g of preformed ATNCs/d (18). Fecal ATNC levels
exceeded this value in all subjects studied so far, showing that

in rat models (29). Endogenous N-nitrosation may thus be the
mechanism behind the increased risk of colorectal cancer from
red meat, but further work is required to establish the geno-
toxicity and carcinogenicity of these compounds present in the
colon, especially when large amounts of red meat are con-
sumed.

White Button Mushroom Phytochemicals Inhibit Aromatase Activity and
Breast Cancer Cell Proliferation1,2

ABSTRACT Estrogen is a major factor in the development of breast cancer. In situ estrogen production by
aromatase/estrogen synthetase in breast cancer plays a dominant role in tumor proliferation. Because natural
compounds such as ﬂavones and isoﬂavones have been shown to be inhibitors of aromatase, it is thought that
vegetables that contain these phytochemicals can inhibit aromatase activity and suppress breast cancer cell
proliferation. Heat-stable extracts were prepared from vegetables and screened for their ability to inhibit aromatase
activity in a human placental microsome assay. The white button mushroom (species Agaricus bisporus) sup-
pressed aromatase activity dose dependently. Enzyme kinetics demonstrated mixed inhibition, suggesting the
presence of multiple inhibitors or more than one inhibitory mechanism. “In cell” aromatase activity and cell
proliferation were measured using MCF-7aro, an aromatase-transfected breast cancer cell line. Phytochemicals in
the mushroom aqueous extract inhibited aromatase activity and proliferation of MCF-7aro cells. These results
suggest that diets high in mushrooms may modulate the aromatase activity and function in chemoprevention in
postmenopausal women by reducing the in situ production of estrogen.

J. Nutr. 131: 3288 –3293, 2001.

KEY WORDS:

● breast cancer ● aromatase ● white button mushrooms ● diet and cancer prevention

Breast cancer is the most common cancer affecting women.
Despite earlier detection and improved adjuvant therapies, the
breast cancer incidence was 109.7 cases per 100,000 women
and the death rate was 25.6 per 100,000 women between 1990
and 1997 (1). Emerging evidence suggests that in situ estrogen
production in the breast of postmenopausal women may play
an important biological role in carcinogenesis (2–7). Aro-
matase, a cytochrome P450 enzyme complex, converts andro-
gens to estrogens. Aromatase expression occurs in breast tu-
mors (2,6) and may play a more dominant role in tumor
proliferation than circulating estradiol (8 –10).

A major effort to reduce breast cancer mortality and mor-
bidity is focused on developing better breast cancer prevention
strategies. Hormonal blockade with tamoxifen has reduced the
incidence of invasive and noninvasive breast cancer in high
risk women (11). An alternative drug-based strategy for hor-
monal modulation is the inhibition of aromatase (12). Aro-
matase inhibitors reduce serum estradiol levels in healthy
female volunteers and in animal studies (13–16).

Although pharmaceutical agents have therapeutic and pre-
ventative roles in breast cancer, the use of foods and dietary
compounds to prevent breast cancer is currently being ex-
plored. A variety of complementary substances including plant

extracts, fruits and vegetables, vitamins, minerals and minor
dietary constituents are undergoing vigorous evaluation as
promising sources of anticancer agents (17). Plants contain a
variety of compounds that block the formation of carcinogens,
alter membrane structure, suppress DNA synthesis, enhance
cell differentiation and compete with estrogen for estrogen
receptors (18). Cohort and case-controlled epidemiologic
studies have investigated the effect of certain vegetables and
fruits on the incidence of cancer (18 –20). The contribution of
fruits and vegetables in relative risk reduction of breast cancer
is conﬂicting and it is difﬁcult to draw absolute conclusions
from the current data. A recent meta-analysis did suggest an
inverse relationship between intake of fruits and vegetables
with the relative risk of developing breast cancer (21). This
association was greater for vegetables than for fruits. There is
compelling epidemiologic data in Asian women who have a
four- to sixfold lower risk of breast cancer than Western
women (22). One of the reported differences between these
two populations is the consumption of soy protein (23). A
possible mechanism-based explanation for the lower incidence
of breast cancer is that soy is high in phytoestrogens (24),
phytochemicals that suppress aromatase (25–31).

Our laboratory has been interested in the interaction of
ﬂavone and isoﬂavone phytoestrogens with human aromatase
and the inhibitory capacity of various compounds (32,33). In
the quest for novel compounds, we reported promising data on
the effect of grape juice on aromatase inhibition and in vivo
suppression of breast cancer cell growth in a nude mouse tumor
model (34). These exciting ﬁndings have encouraged us to
screen a variety of vegetables using aromatase inhibition as the
mechanism to identify vegetables that could be a potential

dietary source for novel aromatase inhibitors. The current
study identiﬁed the edible mushroom, Agaricus bisporus, as a
potent inhibitor of aromatase.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Materials. Androstenedione, testosterone and 4-hydroxy andro-
stenedione (4-OHA)5 were obtained from Sigma (St. Louis, MO).
[1␤-3H]androstenedione ([1␤-3H]A) was purchased from NEN Du-
pont (Boston, MA). Heat-stable extracts from green onion, celery,
carrot, bell pepper, broccoli, spinach and mushroom were prepared by
boiling in water (70 g wet matter/200 mL H2O) and centrifuging at
35,000 ⫻ g for 30 min. The supernatant was Millipore (0.45 ␮m;
Bedford, MA) ﬁltered, concentrated in a Speed-VAC centrifuge and
reconstituted in H2O at 7.5X concentration (7.5XH2O). Heat was
used to break up the compartmentalization that exists in biological
materials (35).

For the kinetic analysis, cell culture studies, step gradient separa-
tions and HPLC analysis, stock preparation of the mushroom extract
was prepared from fresh, washed white button mushrooms (Agaricus
bisporus). The lyophilized heat-stable white button mushroom extract
was reconstituted as a 10X stock concentrate in water (10XH2O) or
culture medium (10XCM) as indicated below for individual studies.
Aromatase inhibition studies were performed using human pla-
cental microsome preparations, which contain a high level of aro-
matase. Microsomes were prepared from human placenta as previ-
ously described (36,37). The MCF-7 cell line, a human estrogen
receptor positive (ER⫹) adenocarcinoma, was obtained from ATCC
(Manassas, VA). MCF-7 cells transfected with human aromatase
(MCF-7aro) were generated by stable transfection of MCF-7 cells
with the human placenta aromatase cDNA under the control of the
␤-actin promoter (38).

Placental microsome assay. Aromatase converts androgens to
estrogens through three hydroxylations (39). The third hydroxy-
lation is thought to involve position C1 of androgens, which leads
to aromatization of the A ring of the steroids. The aromatase assay
was performed in the following manner. The substrate, androst-4-
ene-3, 17-dione [1␤-3H(N)] (speciﬁc activity 37 MBq/mol) was
dissolved in serum-free cell culture medium, millipore ﬁltered and
added to the assay mixture. The assay mixture (500 ␮L) consisted
of 20 ␮g placental microsomes, 100 nmol/L [3H]-androstenedione,
10 ␮mol/L progesterone, 1 g/L bovine serum albumin and 67
mmol/L potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4 (34). After a 10-min
preincubation at 22°C, 12 mmol/L NADPH (50 ␮L) was intro-
duced and the reaction was continued at 37°C for an additional 20
min in the pilot vegetable and mushroom screening experiments.
The incubation time was reduced to 10 min for all of the exper-
iments with the white button mushroom. The enzymatic activity
was terminated with 5% trichloroacetic acid. One molecule of
[3H]-H2O is formed when one molecule of androstenedione is
converted to estrone. The supernatant containing the aromatase
product, [3H]-H2O, was extracted with chloroform and with dex-
tran-treated charcoal. The suspension was centrifuged (700 ⫻ g for
10 min) and an aliquot of the supernatant was counted for radio-
[3H]-H2O
activity. Aromatase activity was calculated as pmol
formed/(mg protein 䡠 h). Analyses were performed in triplicate and
the data are expressed as the mean ⫾ SD. The [3H]-H2O release
assay was veriﬁed in our laboratory by the product extraction assay
(38).

Kinetic determinations. The inhibition kinetic studies were
performed using unfractionated white button mushroom extract. The
concentration range of [1␤-3H]A ranged from 10 to 200 nmol/L. The
rate of the reaction was previously established in our laboratory to be
linear under these conditions (31–33,40,41). Analyses were per-
formed in triplicate and the data are expressed as the mean ⫾ SD.

Aromatase “in cell” activity in MCF7aro cells. MCF7aro cells
are androgen-responsive through aromatase-dependent conversion of
testosterone to estrogen. MCF7aro cells (2 ⫻ 105 cell/well) were
cultured in 6-well plates in Eagles’s minimum essential medium
(MEM) with Earle’s salts (Irvine Scientiﬁc, Santa Ana, CA) with 1
mmol/L pyruvate, 2 mmol/L glutamine (Irvine Scientiﬁc) and 10%
heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (⌬FCS) (Omega Scientiﬁc, Tarzana,
CA) overnight. The following day the medium was changed to
phenol red minus MEM (␾⫺MEM) (Irvine Scientiﬁc) with 10%
charcoal dextran–treated heat-inactivated serum (cd⌬FCS) for 24 h.
The medium was removed and fresh cd⌬FCS medium containing the
additives was introduced. Cells were cultured in cd⌬FCS (5 mL/well)
alone (control), with 2.5, 5 or 10 ␮L of 10X mushroom extract
reconstituted in culture medium (10XCM)/mL cd⌬FCS or 4-OHA
(100 ␮mol/L) as a control inhibitor. After the cells were cultured for
48 h, the medium was removed and the cells were washed twice with
5 mL PBS. The “in cell” aromatase assay was performed with [1␤-
3H]A in ␾⫺MEM without calf serum for 1 h as described (42). The
supernatant was removed and extracted as previously described (42)
with 1 mL chloroform to remove unreacted [1␤-3H]A. The aqueous
layer containing the aromatase product, [3H]-H2O, was extracted
with dextran-treated charcoal. An aliquot of the supernatant was
taken for radioactive determination. The cells were solubilized with 1
mL of 0.5 mol/L NaOH. Protein concentration was determined by
the Bradford assay (43). Aromatase activity was expressed as pmol
[3H]-H2O produced/(mg protein䡠h). Analyses were performed in trip-
licate and the data are expressed as the mean ⫾ SD.

Cell proliferation in the presence or absence of white button
mushroom extract. MCF7aro cells were cultured in 6-well plates
under the conditions described above for the “in cell” aromatase assay
with or without mushroom extract for 48 h. Cells were washed twice
with 5 mL PBS and solubilized with 1 mL of 0.5 mol/L NaOH.
Cellular proliferation was determined by quantiﬁcation of protein
synthesis by the Bradford assay (43). The data are reported as mean
mg protein/L ⫾ SD. The use of protein measurements for aromatase-
mediated cell proliferation studies was previously conﬁrmed by cell
count analyses (42).

Fractionation of mushroom extract. Mushroom extract (5 mL of
10XH2O) was fractionated using a Sep-Pak C18 solid phase cartridge
(Waters, Milford, MA) by sequential elution with a step gradient
solvent system ranging from 5 to 90% acetonitrile/H20. Fractions
were lyophilized and reconstituted in 500 ␮L water for fractions
between 5 and 60% acetonitrile or in 10% dimethyl sulfoxide:H2O
for the fractions collected from 70 to 100% acetonitrile/H20. Solvent
controls were assayed. Incremental fractions were assayed for inhibi-
tion of aromatase in the placental microsome assay as described above
for a 10-min incubation time. Dose-response quantiﬁcation was per-
formed using three volumes (10, 25 and 50 ␮L) in triplicate.

Statistical analysis. The data were analyzed by ANOVA or
student’s t test for the “in cell” aromatase activity and for total protein
in the presence or absence of testosterone. Differences were consid-
ered signiﬁcant when P ⬍ 0.05.

RESULTS

Inhibition of aromatase by vegetable extracts. Recent
data from our laboratory demonstrated that phytochemicals in
grape juice could suppress aromatase activity (34). No data are
available on the effect of speciﬁc vegetables on aromatase
activity. Seven common vegetables were selected to test the
hypothesis that vegetables may contain inhibitors of aromatase
activity. The aqueous extraction method for natural com-
pounds has been described (35). This method was selected to
avoid toxic solvents that would require removal before use in
subsequent “in cell” assays. To enhance the recovery of natural
compounds from biological materials, heat was used to break
up the compartmentalization found in these materials (35). In
addition, heat inactivates plant enzymes that could potentially
interfere with the aromatase enzyme assay. Preparations of
heat-stable compounds are also valuable for later biological
applications in animal and human trials in which sterility is

essential. Of the seven vegetable extracts tested, the extract
from white button mushroom (Agaricus bisporus) was the most
effective in inhibiting human placental aromatase (Fig. 1). A
50% inhibition of aromatase activity was achieved with 50 ␮L
of 7.5XH2O mushroom extract. The active component in the
mushroom extract appeared to be water soluble and heat
stable. Of the other extracts evaluated, celery had a modest
inhibitory effect. Extracts prepared from green onion, carrot,
bell pepper, broccoli and spinach did not inhibit aromatase
under these experimental conditions.

stufﬁng (Agaricus bisporus),

Aromatase inhibition by extracts from different varieties of
mushrooms. To determine whether aromatase inhibition was
unique to the white button mushroom, ten additional varieties
of mushrooms were evaluated, i.e., woodear (Auricularia spp.),
crimini (Agaricus bisporus), white button mushroom (Agaricus
bisporus), oyster (Pleurotus ostreatus), Italian brown (Pleurotus
spp.), enoki (Flammulina velutipes), baby button mushrooms
(Agaricus bisporus),
shiitake
(Lentinula edodes), chanterelle (Cantharellus spp.) and porto-
bello (Agaricus bisporus) (Fig. 2). The studies identiﬁed that
the stufﬁng mushroom had the most potent inhibitory effect
against aromatase activity. The shiitake, white button mush-
room, portabello, crimini and baby button mushrooms also
demonstrated signiﬁcant antiaromatase effects. These ﬁndings
suggest that a number of varieties of mushroom possess inhib-
itory effects on aromatase activity in an in vitro assay. All
subsequent studies were performed using heat-stable extracts
from the white button mushroom.

Aromatase inhibition kinetic analysis with white button
mushroom extract. The double reciprocal plot of aromatase
inhibition with respect to androstenedione by white button
mushroom extract is shown in Figure 3. The mixed-type
inhibition kinetic proﬁle for the whole-mushroom extract
suggested the presence of one or more inhibitors in the extract
and/or more than one inhibitory mechanism.

extraction cartridges (Fig. 4). Dose-response experiments were
performed using the human placental microsome assay. The
maximum inhibition was identiﬁed in the 15% elution frac-
tion. These results indicate the presence of more than one
antiaromatase chemical in the white button mushroom ex-
tract. Scale-up isolation, puriﬁcation and structural character-
ization of these antiaromatase chemicals are currently under-
way in our laboratory.

“In cell” aromatase assay. The “in cell” aromatase assay
was performed to determine the feasibility of introducing the
extract in a whole-cell system. The dose-response effect of
white button mushroom extract on “in cell” aromatase activity
was determined in MCF7aro cells cultured in the presence or
absence of testosterone (Fig. 5). The cells were cultured with-
out mushroom extract or in the presence of increasing con-
centrations of mushroom extract. The aromatase inhibitor,
4-OHA, was used as the known inhibitor for a positive inhib-
itory control. Mushroom extract inhibited aromatase activity
in a dose-dependent manner with all three concentrations of
white button mushroom extract evaluated. In the presence of
testosterone, an aromatase substrate, the basal aromatase ac-
tivity was increased. This testosterone-dependent increase in
aromatase activity remained in the presence of the lowest
concentration (2.5 ␮L) of mushroom extract. When the
mushroom extract concentration was increased, there was a
proportional decrease in the testosterone-dependent aro-
matase activity with the intermediate dose of mushroom ex-
tract (5 ␮L). In the presence of the highest concentration of
mushroom extract (10 ␮L), the aromatase activity was inhib-

Aromatase “in cell” assay in MCF7 cells transfected

in the presence of white button
(Agaricus bisporus) mushroom extract with and without testosterone.
The dose-response effect of mushroom extract on “in cell” aromatase
activity was evaluated in MCF7aro cells (2 ⫻ 105 cells/well) cultured in
six-well plates with and without 1 nmol/L testosterone. The cells were
cultured without mushroom extract or with 2.5, 5 or 10 ␮L lyophilized
mushroom extract reconstituted in culture medium (10XCM)/mL of cell
culture medium (5 mL/well). The aromatase inhibitor, 4-hydroxyandro-
stenedione (4-OHA), was used as the inhibitor control. The assay was
done in triplicate and the results are expressed as mean ⫾ SD. Aro-
matase activity differed among groups for cells grown in the absence (P
⬍0.001) and in the presence (P ⬍0.001) of testosterone. The vehicle
control without testosterone differed from the testosterone control (P
⫽ 0.0122). The samples that were treated with mushroom extract at 2.5
␮L with and without testosterone differed (P ⫽0.002). The samples that
were treated with mushroom extract at 5 ␮L with and without testos-
terone tended to differ (P ⫽ 0.06).

enzyme. These cells are ER⫹ and demonstrate increased cell
proliferation in the presence of testosterone. Cell proliferation
was determined by measuring total cellular protein in the
presence or absence of the mushroom extract as has been
previously described (42). The dose-response effect of mush-
room extract on total protein expression in MCF7aro cells
cultured in the presence or absence of testosterone is shown in
Figure 6. The aromatase inhibitor, 4-OHA, was used as the
known inhibitor. Cells grown in the presence of testosterone
demonstrated increased proliferation. This is the expected
response in MCF7aro cells that are transfected with aromatase
and are ER⫹. Exposure to low doses of mushroom extract did
not decrease the total amount of protein below the control
conditions at 48 h. The highest dose of mushroom extract,
however, decreased the advantage gained by the addition of
testosterone to a level similar to that seen with 4-OHA. These
ﬁndings suggest that the inhibitory effect of white button
mushroom extract is through a speciﬁc antiaromatase action,
not a cytotoxic effect.

DISCUSSION

In the search for new approaches to breast cancer chemo-
prevention, known pharmaceutical agents have been tested for
their potential beneﬁcial effects. Chemoprevention aims to

seasons. Furthermore, the white button mushroom is less costly
than other varieties of mushrooms, making it more readily
purchased by the average consumer.

MCF7aro cells are estrogen dependent for growth. Trans-
fection with human aromatase provides them with the ability
to synthesize estrogens and leads to enhanced growth. Deter-
mination of the effect of white button mushroom extract on
cellular proliferation has revealed that the heat-stable extract
suppresses only the androgen-induced cellular proliferation as
determined by total cell protein. The total protein determina-
tion in cells without androgen did not demonstrate a decrease
at the three doses of mushroom extract evaluation, indicating
that the extract was not toxic. The use of protein measure-
ments for aromatase-mediated cell proliferation studies has
been previously conﬁrmed by cell count analyses (42).

Mushrooms have been recognized for their edible and func-
tional properties for centuries (47). Edible mushrooms have
beneﬁcial effects on health and in the treatment of disease
through their immunomodulatory, antineoplastic and lipid-
reducing properties (47). The shiitake mushroom has served as
the model for investigating functional mushrooms and isolat-
ing pure compounds for pharmaceutical use. Water extracts of
the shiitake mushroom prevent tumor growth in mice (48).
We have demonstrated that a water-soluble extract from the
white button mushroom can suppress aromatase activity.

The data from our study suggest that the white button
mushroom may have potential therapeutic beneﬁt as a func-
tional food by reducing the activity of aromatase, the putative
enzyme for converting androgens to estrogens. These studies
have been performed using the crude extract to avoid potential
changes in efﬁcacy by the puriﬁcation process and to maintain
a close resemblance to the composition as a food source. The
whole extract demonstrates efﬁcacy in an “in cell” assay system
producing aromatase inhibition without toxic side effects. The
limitation of this approach is that this extract contains a
spectrum of compounds that are further metabolized and may
produce potent intermediary molecules that participate in
alternative mechanisms.

Future work will focus on isolation, puriﬁcation and char-
acterization of the components. Animal studies using time-
course and dose-response data are being designed to test the
whole extract and compare it to the most potent puriﬁed
components. Speciﬁc site-directed mutants of the aromatase
binding pocket will serve to characterize the binding charac-
teristics of the puriﬁed components and compare the inhibi-
tory activity and binding capacity of the mushroom extract
with known aromatase inhibitors (31,32,41,49,50). The white
button mushroom demonstrates the ability to inhibit aro-
matase activity in vitro and in a cell culture system, but like
other mushroom varieties, it may contain a number of other
bioactive compounds with diverse biological activity. The
puriﬁed compound(s) may be very different from the whole
mushroom in their inhibitory activity on aromatase. The in-
evitable questions that follow are whether eating the whole
mushroom has preventative or therapeutic value, and if so,
how much mushroom should be consumed to achieve a ben-
eﬁcial effect. Future studies should answer some of these ques-
tions and provide guidelines for incorporation of mushrooms
and/or their extracts into the diet for their “nutraceutical”
properties.

modulate speciﬁc steps in the neoplastic process including
prevention of DNA damage by free radicals, inhibition of
cellular proliferation and promotion of cellular differentiation
(44). A major strategy for breast cancer chemoprevention is
directed at abolishing the estrogen effects. The in situ reduc-
tion of estradiol synthesis by inhibition of aromatase could
reduce estrogen-dependent cellular proliferation and estrogen
conversion to genotoxic metabolites (12).

The present study was undertaken to screen and evaluate a
number of vegetables as potential natural sources of aromatase
inhibitors. Heat-stable, water-soluble extracts were prepared.
A recent study reported that serum concentrations of ␣-caro-
tene and lutein were higher when raw vegetable juice was
consumed than when raw vegetables or cooked vegetables
were consumed (45). The current approach was undertaken to
maximize extraction of small molecules but avoid toxic sol-
vents (35). Using an in vitro human placental microsome
aromatase assay, the white button mushroom was found to be
a potent inhibitor of aromatase. The assay of aromatase activ-
ity in human placental microsomes in the presence of a variety
of compounds is an established model to measure relative
inhibitory effects of a series of chemopreventive compounds
(46). We further conﬁrmed the biological activity of white
button mushroom in an aromatase-transfected breast cancer
cell line to conﬁrm the inhibitory effect in an “in cell” model.
The white button, shiitake, portabello, crimini and baby but-
ton mushroom varieties demonstrated the ability to inhibit
aromatase activity in an in vitro assay. The work presented
here focused on the white button mushroom because it dem-
onstrated potent inhibition and is easily available during all

Abstract

Background: To our knowledge, no previous study has evaluated the associations of antioxidant intake with the risk of

ovarian cancer in African-American women, who are known to have high mortality from the disease.

Objective: We sought to evaluate these associations among 406 ovarian cancer cases and 632 age- and site-matched

controls of African-American descent recruited from AACES (African American Cancer Epidemiology Study), a population-

based, case-control study in 11 geographical areas within the United States.

Methods: Multivariable logistic regression models were used to estimate ORs and 95% CIs adjusted for a wide range of

potentially confounding factors, including age, region, education, parity, oral contraceptive use, menopause, tubal ligation,

family history, body mass index (BMI), smoking status, total energy, and physical activity.
Results: Women with the highest intakes of supplemental selenium (>20 mg/d) had an ;30% lower risk of ovarian cancer
than those with no supplemental intake (OR: 0.67; 95% CI: 0.46, 0.97; P-trend = 0.035). This inverse association was
stronger in current smokers (OR: 0.13; 95% CI: 0.04, 0.46; P-trend = 0.001). There was no association with dietary
selenium. The associations with carotenoid intakes were weak and nonsigniﬁcant (P = 0.07–0.60). We observed no

association with dietary or supplemental intake of vitamin C or vitamin E. There were no appreciable differences in results

between serous and nonserous tumors.

Conclusions: These ﬁndings provide the ﬁrst insights, to our knowledge, into the potential association between

antioxidants and ovarian cancer in African-American women, indicating potential inverse associations with supplemental
selenium. J Nutr 2017;147:621–7.

Introduction

Ovarian cancer is a leading cause of gynecologic cancer death
(1). Given the relatively poor survival of women diagnosed with
the disease and the lack of effective screening tools, identifying
modiﬁable risk factors is essential to reducing ovarian cancer
mortality and morbidity. The etiology of ovarian cancer is
multifactorial, encompassing reproductive, hormonal, genetic,
environmental, and lifestyle factors. Among dietary risk factors,
antioxidant compounds have been of interest. A few studies have
suggested that a high consumption of fruit and vegetables may
decrease ovarian cancer risk, as may the use of antioxidant
supplements (2). An imbalance between free radicals and
antioxidants (oxidative stress) can lead to the formation of

genotoxic lipid peroxidation byproducts and contribute
to progression of ovarian carcinogenesis (3). However, the
number of dietary studies of ovarian cancer is relatively small, and
studies have been conducted almost exclusively in Caucasian
women. Hence, the association between antioxidant intake and
ovarian cancer risk in African-American women is virtually
unexplored. This may be an important gap in knowledge given
the results of studies that suggest the possibility of higher levels of
oxidative stress in African Americans (4, 5), lower intakes of
antioxidants (6, 7), different lifestyle correlates of antioxidant
levels (8), and stronger associations between antioxidant intake
and cancer risk in African Americans (6, 9). To address this lack
of evidence and to allow comparisons with other populations,

we evaluated associations of commonly studied antioxidants with
risk of ovarian cancer in a large, population-based, multi-
center case-control study of women enrolled in AACES (African
American Cancer Epidemiology Study).

Methods

Design and participants. This study was conducted among women
of African-American descent recruited into AACES, an ongoing,
population-based, case-control study of ovarian cancer in 11 sites in the
United States (Alabama, Georgia, Illinois, Louisiana, Michigan, North
Carolina, New Jersey, Ohio, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Texas) (10).
Cases were identiﬁed by rapid case ascertainment utilizing state
cancer registries; Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results
Program registries; or hospitalsÕ gynecologic oncology departments.
Eligible cases include all self-identiﬁed African-American women
between 20 and 79 y of age with newly diagnosed, histologically
conﬁrmed invasive epithelial ovarian cancer. Controls who self-identiﬁed
as African American were selected by using random-digit dialing and
were frequency-matched to cases by 5-y age groups and state of
residence. Women who had a previous history of ovarian cancer or a
bilateral oophorectomy were ineligible controls. Among those who
could be contacted, 66.5% of potential cases and 72% of potential
controls agreed to participate in the main telephone interview. The study
was approved by the Institutional Review Boards at all study sites.

Data were collected by a computer-assisted telephone interview,
which included detailed questions on demographic factors, personal and
family history of cancer, reproductive history, medication use, lifestyle
characteristics, height and weight, and other factors of relevance to
African-American women, such as skin pigmentation, perceived dis-
crimination, and cultural beliefs.

Dietary assessment. We assessed individual exposure levels of
antioxidant nutrients from both food sources and dietary supplements,
speciﬁcally vitamins E and C, carotenoids, and selenium. Dietary
information was assessed via a self-administered Block 2005 FFQ,
which included questions on the usual frequency and portion size for 110
food and beverages consumed over the year preceding diagnosis for cases
or the interview date for controls (11). Usual intake of dietary
supplements of antioxidant nutrients, including multivitamins, was also
collected. Nutrient intakes from diet and supplements were derived by
Block Dietary Data Systems based on the USDA Food and Nutrient
Database for Dietary Studies 1.0. Validation studies of the Block FFQ
have been described elsewhere (11, 12). A previous evaluation showed
that FFQ reliability was high, with Pearson correlation coefﬁcients for

micronutrients from supplements and food ranging from 0.65 to 0.88.
FFQ validity was moderate to high, with attenuated Pearson correlation
coefﬁcients for micronutrients from supplements and food ranging from
0.49 to 0.76 (11). The validity correlation for selenium for this
questionnaire was 0.56.

The present study included 495 cases and 711 controls who completed
the main questionnaire via telephone interview by December 2014. After
excluding 72 cases and 76 controls who had not completed the FFQ for
dietary assessment at time of analysis, 1 case and 3 controls who reported
an extreme energy intake (greater than twice the interquartile range of log
energy intake), and 16 cases subsequently determined to be noneligible by
pathology review, a total of 406 cases and 632 controls remained for the
analysis. We compared characteristics of women completing and not
completing the FFQ and found no difference with respect to age,
education, region, BMI, and smoking (data not shown).

Statistical analyses. We compared the distributions of characteristics
between cases and controls using chi-square tests or t tests as appropriate.
We used Spearman rank correlations to compare casesÕ and controlsÕ
intakes of antioxidants of interest, which were selected a priori and
included total and individual carotenoids, vitamin E, vitamin C, and
selenium. We used unconditional logistic regressions to estimate ORs
and 95% CIs of ovarian cancer by quartile of antioxidant intake; quartiles
were based on the distribution of controls. We investigated dietary (food
sources), supplemental, and total antioxidant intake. For selected antiox-
idants, supplement intake was categorized as no use, medium, and high,
where the latter 2 categories represent supplement users with intakes
below and above the median, respectively. Then, a summary of total
dietary plus supplement was created. The median value of each category
was treated as a continuous variable in tests for linear trends. An a of 0.05
was used to determine statistical signiﬁcance. All statistical analyses were
2-sided and were performed by using SAS version 9.4.

The full multivariable model was adjusted for age, geographic region
(Midwest, South Central, or South Mid-Atlantic), education (high
school or less, some post–high school training, college, or graduate
degree), parity (0, 1–2, or >2), oral contraceptive use (never, <60, or
$60 mo), menopause status (pre- or postmenopause), tubal ligation (no or
yes), ﬁrst-degree family history of breast or ovarian cancer (no or yes),
BMI (in kg/m2) calculated from self-reported weight and height 1 y
before and treated as categorical variable [underweight or normal (<25),
overweight (25–29.9), or obese ($30)], smoking status (never, former,
or current), recreational physical activity (0, <150, or $150 min/wk 1 y
before), and total energy intake. Other covariates as listed in Table
1 (e.g., alcohol consumption and hysterectomy) were evaluated but
were not included in the ﬁnal multivariate model because none changed
the effect estimates by >10%.

We examined the association between antioxidants and ovarian
cancer across strata of smoking (never, former, or current). Tests of
statistical interaction were conducted by using Wald hypotheses tests
about the model regression coefﬁcients pertaining to the interaction,
resulting in a Wald statistic with asymptotic chi-square distribution. The
P values for the tests, with correct speciﬁcation, can be read from SAS
proc logistic Type 3 Analysis of Effects table and by specifying a
‘‘contrast’’ statement in proc logistic. We also conducted analyses
between serous and nonserous cases and tested for heterogeneity by
statistically comparing parameter estimates between corresponding
relative risk ratios in a multinomial regression model.

Results

As expected, established ovarian cancer risk factors differed
between cases and controls (Table 1). Cases were older and less
likely to have children, to use oral contraceptives, to have a
family history of breast or ovarian cancer, to consume alcohol,
or to have had a tubal ligation. Cases and controls had similar
intakes of total energy, protein, fat, and carbohydrates.

Median values of antioxidant intake were similar between
cases and controls (data not shown). Among the antioxidants
evaluated in this study, we only observed a statistically

signiﬁcant difference in median intake between cases and
controls for selenium from dietary supplements (2.86 mg/d for
cases compared with 5.71 mg/d for controls; P = 0.031). In
multivariable models, women who reported the highest intakes
of total selenium had an ;30% lower risk of ovarian cancer
than those with the lowest intakes (Table 2). Similar associations
were observed for both dietary and supplemental selenium,
although statistical signiﬁcance was reached only for supple-
mental intake. The inverse associations with selenium intake
were generally stronger in smokers (Supplemental Table 1).
In additional analyses (data not shown), we did not observe
effect modiﬁcation of
the association between selenium
supplements and ovarian cancer over strata of dietary selenium
intake (P = 0.44). There was also no association of dietary or
supplemental zinc or copper intake with ovarian cancer.

Weak inverse associations of ovarian cancer risk with in-
takes of carotenoids were not signiﬁcant (P = 0.07–0.60)
(Table 3). Ovarian cancer risk was positively associated
with b-cryptoxanthine (P = 0.03) (Table 3), but was not
associated with vitamin C or E intake (Table 4). We did not
observe appreciable differences in the results when we compared
serous with nonserous tumors (data not shown).

Discussion

In this population-based ovarian cancer study of African-American
women, compared with women with selenium intake in the lowest
quartile, those with intake in the highest quartile had an ~30% lower
risk of ovarian cancer; risk estimates were statistically signiﬁcant for
supplemental selenium but not for dietary (P = 0.1) or total selenium
(P = 0.1). Although we observed an inverse trend with increasing
intake of total carotenoids, statistical signiﬁcance was lacking. We
observed no association with either vitamin C or vitamin E. We
observed no appreciable differences in results between serous and
nonserous tumors, the 2 major histological types of ovarian
carcinoma.

An imbalance between free radicals (reactive oxygen species) and
antioxidants results in oxidative stress, which plays a role in ovarian
cancer pathogenesis by causing structural alterations in DNA directly
or indirectly through the formation of genotoxic lipid peroxidation
byproducts that react with DNA (3). Animal and human experi-
mental studies have shown that surface ovarian epithelial cells
contain elevated concentrations of 8-oxoguanine during ovulation,
which is an important mutagenic lesion in DNA (13). It has
therefore been suggested that limiting oxidative stress to the
ovarian epithelium could be considered a ﬁrst-line defense
against ovarian cancer.

The anticarcinogenic effects of selenium in a wide variety of
animal models prompted several decades of epidemiologic
studies of cancer in humans with mixed results (14). Regarding
ovarian cancer speciﬁcally, results have also been mixed.
Epidemiologic studies of selenium from food and supplements
(15–18), serum (19, 20), hair (21), and toenails (14) have shown
both null and inverse associations. We discerned no clear pattern
among those studies that might reconcile the disparate ﬁndings
based on methodologic or study design features.

The biological mechanisms underlying the multiple pathways
through which selenium may inﬂuence cancer development
remain unclear. Recently hypothesized mechanisms include a
chemopreventive action of speciﬁc selenoproteins in normal cells
that, conversely, take on a promoting role in existing neoplasms
(22). Whether such a dual action may help explain mixed ﬁndings
in the epidemiological literature is also unclear. Unlike our study,
most of the previous studies that examined selenium intake in
relation to ovarian cancer risk found no association with
supplemental selenium intake (15, 17, 18, 23), and one found
a positive association (16). Selenium from foods was examined
separately in only one study (16) and showed a statistically

signiﬁcant inverse association between dietary selenium intake
and ovarian cancer risk. As the authors of that study noted,
however, selenium concentrations in soil vary greatly by location.
Therefore, nutrient composition databases may inconsistently
reﬂect the actual intake of selenium from food.

The inverse association we observed was stronger than in
previous studies of white women, which may be caused by
higher levels of nutrient deﬁciency and/or oxidative stress in
African Americans (4, 5) and lower antioxidant intakes (6, 9).
These conditions may result in more African-American women
with suboptimal levels or outright deﬁciency. In our data, the
inverse association with supplemental selenium intake was not
modiﬁed by dietary intake, suggesting that ameliorating deﬁ-
ciency is not the primary mechanism.

Regarding deﬁciency,

the results of several well-known
clinical trials of antioxidant supplements did not show reduc-
tions in the risk of any cancer (24–26), although reductions in
overall cancer rates were observed in a trial conducted in a
nutritionally deﬁcient population (27). In a study in Linxian
Province (China), both serum selenium (28) and serum vitamin
E (a-tocopherol) (29) were inversely associated with cancer risk.
The possibility that inverse associations with antioxidants tend
to be stronger in (or limited to) individuals with high levels of
oxidative stress is supported by the stronger inverse associations
we observed in smokers. However, we cannot exclude the
possibility that our results were inﬂuenced by uncontrolled (or
residual) confounding from lifestyle factors or by any of the
other methodological limitations noted above.

Carotenoids are lipid-soluble, yellow-orange-red pigments
found in all higher plants and some animals. Proposed chemo-
preventive mechanisms include antioxidant, anti-inﬂammation,
antiangionesesis, antiproliferation, apoptosis
induction,
immune modulation, modulation of phase I and II enzymes,
induction of cell differentiation, enhancement of gap junction
communication, and others (30). The association between
carotenoids and ovarian cancer risk is currently unclear in
epidemiologic studies. Although study results have been mixed,
prospective cohort studies have largely shown no association
with the major carotenoids (17, 19, 31–33) or speciﬁcally with
b-carotene (34, 35). Among the case-control studies that exam-
ined speciﬁc carotenoids, results have not been consistent regard-
ing which showed statistically signiﬁcant inverse associations (2,
15, 16, 36–44). Six of the latter studies showed inverse associa-
tions with leutin and zeaxanthin (2, 32, 36, 40, 42, 43), whereas 2
studies showed no association (15, 16). Case-control studies that
examined summary measures of total carotenoids (36, 38, 41, 42,
44) have tended to show statistically signiﬁcant inverse associa-
tions. However, none of the prospective cohort studies showed an
association with such summary measures. Although most of the
cohort studies were statistically underpowered, the results of a
pooled analysis of 10 cohort studies with ;2000 cases of
ovarian cancer (32) also found no association. A few studies
examined the association between carotenoids and ovarian
cancer by tumor subtype (15, 32, 37, 38) and more often found
stronger inverse associations for mucinous tumors (15, 32, 38).
Finally, we observed a positive trend for b-cryptoxanthin. A
similar positive association with b-cryptoxanthin was found in
one previous study (15). The authors of that study noted (p. 673)
that as an oxycarotenoid or xanthophylls (C-OH),
is
biologically plausible that b-cryptoxanthin may act on ovar-
ian cells differently from other hydrocarbon carotenoids (C-H).
Vitamin E is an important lipid-soluble antioxidant, and
animal and human studies have shown that it may prevent the
formation of lipid peroxides, which have been observed to

it

induce oxidant damage of DNA (18). The prospective studies of
dietary and supplemental vitamin E and ovarian cancer risk have
shown mostly null results (17, 32–35, 45). The results of case-
control studies are more mixed with some showing null (15, 16,
23, 34, 38) and others showing inverse associations (18, 36, 37,
42, 44). One case-control study found an inverse association
with supplemental vitamin E intake that was not observed with
dietary vitamin E (23). Overall, the results for vitamin E supple-
ments have been as inconsistent as those for diet (15–18, 23, 33). To
date, the number of studies that considered ovarian cancer subtype
is too small to discern any related patterns in ﬁndings.

The results of studies of vitamin C intake from diet or
supplements have been mostly null (15–18, 32–36, 38, 41, 45,
46), but a few studies have found inverse associations with
supplemental (23) or total vitamin C intake (42, 44). There also
have been some reports of higher risk of ovarian cancer in
women who reported taking vitamin C supplements (17, 34),
although the majority of studies have shown neither a positive
nor an inverse association with risk.

The reasons for the inconsistent ﬁndings with antioxidants
across studies are unclear. One possibility is that this inconsis-
tency reﬂects the lack of a genuine association. Alternatively,
there may be a true association, but the equivocal evidence
reﬂects methodological challenges in addressing this question.
Examples of such methodological
issues include the limited
validity and reliability of some dietary measures, food preparation
methods that are not adequately captured in the FFQ, unquanti-
ﬁed confounding, synergy with genetic and epigenetic factors, and
the fact that different populations can have different burdens of
oxidative stress and, therefore, antioxidant intake may be most
valuable in subgroups of the population with the highest oxidative
stress (3, 47). Future research that rigorously addresses these
methodological shortcomings is needed to move this ﬁeld forward.
A unique strength of our study is that we could recruit a large
sample of African-American women with ovarian cancer and
population-based controls from various geographic regions with
diverse socioeconomic and lifestyle characteristics, which in-
creases our ability to generalize our results to the larger African-
American population. Hence, our study adds to the scarce
literature on the etiology of ovarian cancer in African-American
women. There are also several limitations to our study. Residual
confounding is possible despite the multivariable and mutually
adjusted models. We also recognize the limitations of dietary
recall and selection bias in case-control studies. We did not
obtain circulating levels of the studied antioxidants, which may
help reduce measurement error and potential bias toward the
null. Regarding selection bias, the distribution of risk factors between
cases and controls in our study was in the expected directions
compared with other studies among African-American women (48),
which increased our conﬁdence in the validity of our ﬁndings.

In conclusion, our data suggest that higher intake of supple-
mental selenium may be inversely associated with risk of ovarian
cancer in African-American women. Additional studies are
needed to assess dietary associations with ovarian cancer in
African-American women, speciﬁcally those that include antioxi-
dants and other nutrients that may be lacking in this population.

Abstract
Background: Estrogen receptor-negative (ER−) breast cancer tends to have poorer prognosis than estrogen receptor-
positive breast cancer. A number of studies have examined the association between diet quality as measured by various
diet quality scores and the risk of ER− breast cancer.
Objective: This systematic review aimed to summarize existing evidence on this topic.
Methods: Medline and Embase searches were conducted until 2 April 2017 for cohort and case-control studies on diet
quality scores and ER− breast cancer.
Results: We included 6 prospective cohort studies and 1 case-control study on postmenopausal ER− breast cancer: 4
from Europe and 3 from the United States. There were 12 different diet quality scores: 2 versions of the Dietary Inflam-
matory Index, 4 versions of the Mediterranean diet score, the Healthy Eating Index, the Alternate Healthy Eating Index,
the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score, and 3 versions of low-carbohydrate diet scores that differen-
tiate between different sources of protein and fat. Of the 4 studies on Mediterranean diet scores, 3 showed a significant
inverse association with postmenopausal ER− breast cancer, whereas no consistent association was observed with the
other diet quality scores. Although most diet quality scores in this review share similar food components, most of the
non-Mediterranean diet scores were represented by only 1 study each, and the associations with postmenopausal ER−
breast cancer were mixed. All studies were adjusted for multiple covariates.
Conclusion: This systematic review shows mixed results for an association between a variety of diet quality scores
and postmenopausal ER− cancer. However, results from different versions of the Mediterranean diet scores are more
consistent and suggest an inverse relation with ER− breast cancer. J Nutr 2018;148:100–108.

Breast cancer is one of the most commonly diagnosed can-
cers in women, with the American Cancer Society estimat-
ing 252,710 new cases of invasive breast cancer in 2017 and
∼40,610 deaths (1). About 20% of breast cancers diagnosed
in the United States are estrogen receptor-negative (ER−) (2).

first birth were more strongly associated with estrogen receptor-
positive (ER+) than ER− tumors, whereas duration of lacta-
tion is more strongly associated with a lower risk for ER+ than
for ER− tumors (3). In addition, chemo prevention using ta-
moxifen was particularly effective for reducing the risk of ER+
but not ER− tumors (4). On the other hand, after diagnosis,
ER− tumors have been associated with a worse 5-to-10-y sur-
vival rate compared with ER+ breast cancer (5–7). In one study,
ER− patients had a 1.72-times higher risk of breast cancer–
specific mortality than ER+ patients after controlling for age at

diagnosis, race, grade of cancer, tumor size, lymph node status,
radiotherapy, and year of diagnosis (7). In another study, ER−
status was associated with ∼4 times the risk of developing first
distant metastasis, especially during the first 2 y after diagno-
sis, than that of women with ER+ tumors (8). There are also
fewer treatment options for ER− breast cancers than for ER+
tumors, because these cancers do not respond to the safer and
better-tolerated endocrine treatments (9). Tamoxifen, for exam-
ple, has been shown to have little or no effect on ER− breast
cancer recurrence or mortality (10). Postmastectomy radiother-
apy also fails to improve survival in ER− patients (11).
Given the poorer prognosis and challenges of treatment, pre-
vention of ER− breast cancer is of significant public health im-
portance. While nonmodifiable factors such as parity, age at first
birth, and other hormonal factors are strong predictors for ER+
breast cancer, they have weaker associations with ER− cancer
(12, 13). Therefore, lifestyle risk factors may have a compar-
atively greater influence in the ER− subtype and, therefore, a
potential opportunity for ER− breast cancer prevention. Previ-
ous studies found a significant association between diet quality
and the risk of ER− breast cancer, but not for ER+ breast can-
cer in postmenopausal women (14, 15). Similarly, Zhang et al.
(16) found that carotenoid intake was inversely associated with
ER− but not ER+ breast cancer.

Evaluating the whole diet offers the opportunity to capture
interaction among foods and nutrients. Systematic reviews have
examined the current literature on the association between di-
etary patterns that reflect existing eating habits and the risk of
breast cancers (17–20) and found a possible inverse association,
but ER status was not distinguished. Diet quality scores are con-
structed with predetermined intake criteria and used to evalu-
ate the healthfulness of food choices (15, 21). They are gener-
ally similar in several characteristics, such as emphasis of fruits
and vegetables and de-emphasis of red and processed meats.
The only systematic review and meta-analysis on diet quality
scores was on the Mediterranean diet, and no significant asso-
ciation was noted (22). However, estrogen receptor status was
not considered in the analysis. Because there is a fair amount
of similarities between different diet quality scores, we aim to
evaluate the literature on this method of assessing the healthful-
ness of the entire diet. The purpose of the current review is to
summarize the evidence from observational studies, specifically
cohort and case-control studies, on the association of diet qual-
ity as evaluated by preestablished diet quality scores on the risk
of ER− breast cancer. Because the incidence of postmenopausal
breast cancer is ∼5 times that of premenopausal cancer (23), this
systematic review focuses on data regarding postmenopausal
women.

Methods
This review is registered on the International Prospective Register of
Systematic Reviews (24) in 2016 (PROSPERO, registration number:
42016051570), and it followed PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) reporting guidelines for sys-
tematic reviews. A literature search in Medline and Embase was con-
ducted up to 2 April 2017, and data extraction was performed by 2
reviewers (MD and CM). Year of publication was not considered for
exclusion. This systematic review focuses on predetermined (or a priori)
diet quality scores instead of data-driven dietary patterns derived from
statistical methods such as principal component analysis. The compo-
nents of the predetermined scores are more consistent across studies and
not as highly dependent on population intake. Searches for diet quality
were conducted in the following areas: diet quality, dietary guideline,

diet index, Mediterranean, DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hyper-
tension), vegan, vegetarian, plant based, healthy eating, breast cancer
or tumor or neoplasm, estrogen receptor, postmenopausal, prospective
study, and case-control study. The full search string is listed in Supple-
mental Table 1. The language was restricted to English. Abstracts, gray
literature, and unpublished results or information were not included.
The reference lists of the studies included in this systematic review were
also screened for additional studies.

Study selection. The included studies were required to be ei-
ther prospective cohort or case-control designs and were examined
for an association between diet quality scores and the incidence of
postmenopausal breast cancer with an ER− tumor type. The publica-
tions also had to include a priori–determined diet quality indexes or
scores instead of any posteriori method of identifying dietary patterns,
such as cluster or factor or reduced rank regression analysis. A hierar-
chical approach was used to select studies based on title, abstract, and
full text. Selection was conducted independently by 2 reviewers (MD
and CM) and disagreement was resolved by consensus in consultation
with a third reviewer (TF).

Quality assessment. Each study selected from the original search
was graded using quality checklists developed based on findings from
a systematic review of the available scientific literature by the Scottish
Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) (25) (Supplemental Tables
2 and 3). SIGN develops evidence-based clinical practice guidelines for
the National Health Service in Scotland. Per SIGN guidelines, separate
and designated checklists were used for cohort and case-control studies.
Study grading was completed independently by 2 reviewers (MD and
CM), and inconsistencies in grading were resolved by consensus.

Data extraction. The following information was extracted from
each study: last name of the primary author, year of publication, coun-
try or region where the study was performed, the name of the cohort
study from which the sample was taken, follow-up period (date range
of data collection and duration of study), study size, participant char-
acteristics (sex, age, and number of cases), dietary assessment method
used, exposure variable (specific dietary score examined), characteris-
tics of the diet score, RRs and 95% CIs, and variables adjusted for in
the multivariate models of each study. Two reviewers (MD and CM) in-
dividually extracted data from each study and collaborated to organize
and synthesize the data.

Results
The PRISMA flow diagram (Figure 1) illustrates the search pro-
cess. The initial search yielded 1023 articles, and after removing
50 duplicates, 973 articles were identified for abstract screening.
There were 738 publications excluded based on titles or
abstracts. The selection process yielded 35 potentially relevant
full-text publications, of which 28 studies were excluded: 12 did
not mention any dietary score in the full text; 6 used factor anal-
ysis; 2 used reduced rank regression; 5 were abstracts with no
full texts available; and 1 was a systematic review. Two publi-
cations focused on mortality in breast cancer survivors and, as
a result, were excluded. In total, 7 studies were included in this
systematic review.

Among the 7 studies included, 1 population-based case-
control study was conducted in Germany (26); 3 prospective
cohort studies were conducted in the United States [Nurses’
Health Study (NHS) (14, 15) and Women’s Health Initiative co-
hort study (21)]; and the other 3 were conducted in European
countries [European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and
Nutrition Cohort (EPIC) study (27), Swedish Women’s Lifestyle
and Health cohort study (28), and Netherlands cohort study
(29)] (Table 1). All 7 studies included women with an age range

of 30–79 y (only postmenopausal breast cancer cases were in-
cluded in this review). All studies used an FFQ for dietary as-
sessment, with the number of items ranging from 80–176. In the
EPIC study, an additional food record was combined with the
FFQ to assess dietary intake. In the cohort studies, the follow-up
time ranged from 11 to 26 y. Regression models in each study
were controlled for multiple confounders, including energy in-
take, BMI, age, physical activity, and others. The characteristics
of each study are described in Table 1, and scoring criteria for
each diet quality scores are described in Supplemental Table 4.

Dietary inflammatory index. The Dietary Inflammatory In-
dex (DII) was developed to quantify the inflammatory poten-
tial of individual diets. The 2 studies that used the DII in this
review used 25 (26) and 32 foods (21) and nutrients. Dietary
components were assigned positive or negative points depend-
ing on the data in the literature indicating their inflammatory

potential, with a higher score indicating a more inflammatory

lating concentrations of acute-phase high-sensitivity C-reactive
protein and plasma IL-6, both indicators of systematic inflam-
matory response (26).

status, and a higher DII was associated with a higher risk

Diet quality and ER− breast cancer 105

only for ER−/PR−/human epidermal growth factor 2-positive
subtype (HR comparing extreme quintiles: 2.37; 95% CI: 1.08,
5.20).

The Healthy Eating Index and the Alternate Healthy Eat-
ing Index. The Healthy Eating Index (HEI) was developed by
using the USDA Food Guide Pyramid based on the 1995 Di-
etary Guideline for Americans (30). It contains 10 food groups
and nutrients, including fruits, vegetables, grains, milk, meat,
total fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, sodium, and diet variety.
For each component, the possible score ranges from 0 to 10,
based on the level of intake, with a possible total HEI score
of 0–100. The Alternate Healthy Eating Index (AHEI) was
adapted from the HEI, and it addresses quality within food
groups. The component was modified to fruits, vegetables with-
out potatoes, nuts and soy, white-to-red meat ratio, trans fat and
polyunsaturated fat and saturated fat ratio, cereal fiber, long-
term multivitamin use, and alcohol intake, with a score range
of 0–87.5 (15). In both indexes, a higher score represents a
healthier diet.
Only one study examined the association between the HEI
or the AHEI and ER− breast cancer risk. In the US NHS, with
71,058 women with ≤18 y of follow-up and 575 ER− cases, the
HEI showed no association with ER− tumors (15). On the other
hand, a higher AHEI score showed a significant trend for a lower
risk of ER− breast cancer (RR comparing extreme quintiles:
0.78, 95% CI: 0.59, 1.04; P-trend across 5 quintiles = 0.01).

Mediterranean diet. The original Mediterranean diet index
was developed for the Greek population. It contains 8 com-
ponents, including alcohol, vegetables, fruits, legumes, cereals,
monounsaturated-to-saturated fat ratio, and dairy and meat
products. A higher score reflects a closer resemblance to the
Mediterranean diet (31). Since then, several indexes have been
developed for different populations to reflect the Mediterranean
diet. The Alternate Mediterranean Diet (32) score was an
adaptation of the Mediterranean diet score proposed by Tri-
chopoulou et al. (31).
Four cohort studies evaluated the association between the
Mediterranean diet score and ER− breast cancer risk. All 4 stud-
ies used cutoff points specific to the study population to assign
points to their version of the Mediterranean diet score. Using
data from the EPIC (European Prospective Investigation into
Cancer and Nutrition) cohort with a mean follow-up of 11 y,
Buckland et al. (27) measured resemblance to Mediterranean
diet using the adapted relative Mediterranean diet (arMed),
which did not include alcoholic beverages. The authors catego-
rized their 16-point score into low, medium, and high groups.
The high arMed was associated with a lower risk of ER−/PR−
tumors than was the arMed (high compared with low: RR: 0.80;
95% CI: 0.65, 0.99; P-trend = 0.043). In a Swedish study with
≤16 y of follow-up, a 2-point increment of a 9-point Mediter-
ranean diet score showed no clear association with ER− can-
cer (28). In the Netherlands, an 8-point, Modified Mediter-
ranean Diet Reduced score observed a 40% decreased risk (HR:
0.60; 95% CI: 0.39, 0.93; P-trend across 5 quintiles = 0.03)
in ≤20.3 y of follow-up (29). The only study from the United
States used data from the NHS, with ≤18 y of follow-up (15).
A significant inverse trend for ER− tumors was observed with
a higher Alternate Mediterranean Diet index (RR comparing
extreme quintiles: 0.79; 95% CI: 0.60–1.03; P-trend across 5
quintiles = 0.03).
106 Du et al.

Other diet quality scores: DASH or low-carbohydrate diet
scores. The DASH diet is a healthy eating pattern originally
developed to reduce blood pressure (33). The diet emphasizes
the consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins, fruits,
and vegetables. An index based on population-specific intake
has been developed to reflect adherence to the DASH diet, which
consists of 8 components: fruits, vegetables, nuts and legumes,
low-fat dairy products, whole grains, sodium, sweetened bever-
ages, and red and processed meats (14). For each component,
the score ranges from 1 to 5, based on quintiles according to in-
dividual’s intake ranking and the score range of 8 to 40 points.
The low-carbohydrate diet (LCD) is a popular diet, and
indexes have been created to reflect variations in the diet
that emphasize animal or plant proteins (34). To com-
pute the LCD score, percentages of energy from carbo-
hydrate,
fat, and protein are divided into 11 categories
based on percentiles. The percentile rankings constitute the
points assigned for each macronutrient. For fat and pro-
tein, individuals in the highest category receive the highest,
9 points, and so forth. For carbohydrate, the lowest receives
10 points, and the highest receives 0 points. The overall score
is the summation of points from carbohydrate, fat, and protein
with a range of 0–30 points.
Only one study examined these scores and the risk of ER−
breast cancer in postmenopausal women. In the US NHS with
826 ER− cases, a significant inverse trend was observed with
the DASH diet score (quintile 5 compared with quintile 1—
RR: 0.80; 95% CI: 0.64, 1.01; P-trend = 0.02) (14). How-
ever, among the 3 versions of LCDs, only the vegetable LCD
score showed an inverse trend with ER− cancer risk (RR com-
paring extreme quintiles: 0.81; 95% CI: 0.65, 1.01; P-trend =
0.03), whereas no association was observed with the overall
LCD score or the animal LCD score.

Geographic difference. Overall, the European studies showed
mixed results, with the larger studies showing a significant in-
verse relation and the smaller studies finding no association.
Data from the United States came from only 2 cohorts, and
tended to report inverse associations between dietary quality
scores and risk of postmenopausal ER− cancer (14, 15, 21). For
the various Mediterranean diet scores, slightly more consistency
was observed, with 2 out of 3 European studies (27–29) and 1
US study (15) showing a significant inverse association.

Discussion
In this systematic review, we identified 6 prospective cohort
studies and 1 case-control study that examined the association
between diet quality scores and postmenopausal ER− breast
cancer risk. The studies were large, and the magnitude of associ-
ation comparing top to bottom score categories were moderate
to strong. The most consistent inverse association was observed
for variations of the Mediterranean diet score. Studies on the
other dietary quality scores were mostly from the United States,
and results were mixed. Even though these other dietary qual-
ity scores reflect the healthfulness of the diet, the direction of
associations was inconsistent.

The various versions of Mediterranean diet scores aimed
to examine the foods consumed in the traditional diet of the
area, which generally reflected a healthy diet. The different ver-
sions of the scores were remarkably similar in the food groups
included, although there was variability in the possible score
range. This likely contributed to better consistency in results

observed when compared with the other diet quality scores. A
recent meta-analysis that examined ER− tumors using 2 studies
showed an inverse association between the Mediterranean diet
score and ER− breast cancer (15, 29). The PREDIMED (PRE-
vención con DIeta MEDiterránea) trial examined the Mediter-
ranean diet with additional extra virgin olive oil, the Mediter-
ranean diet with additional mixed nuts, and a low-fat control
arm (35). All women were postmenopausal. In 5 y of follow-
up there were 35 incident breast cancer cases, but only 2 were
confirmed ER−; 31 were confirmed ER+ and the rest were un-
known. Breast cancer incidence was significantly lower in the
Mediterranean diet + extra virgin olive oil arm (HR: 0.62, P =
0.02) when compared with the controls. The Mediterranean diet
+ mixed nuts arm showed a possible lower risk (HR: 0.62, P =
0.24), although it was not statistically significant. These results
regarding the Mediterranean diet are promising, but translating
the findings into specific recommendations for the public would
require further confirmation and more-detailed specification of
intake quantities.

Diet quality scores other than those measuring the adher-
ence of the Mediterranean diet were constructed to measure
specific dietary attributes (e.g., LCD scores) or to reflect an
overall healthy diet (e.g., HEI and AHEI). Therefore, their
characteristics ranged from those that emphasized fruits and
vegetables while discouraging red and processed meats (e.g.,
HEI and DASH), to focusing on specific nutrients (e.g., LCDs).
In addition, the number of score components ranged from 8 in
the DASH (15) score to 32 in one of the DIIs (21). These varia-
tions likely contributed to the inconsistent results observed for
these other diet quality scores.

The studies included were high-quality observational stud-
ies. Each was controlled for multiple confounders, although
residual confounding cannot be completely avoided. The co-
hort studies had a minimum follow-up of 11 y, and the smallest
study had nearly 50,000 participants at the beginning of follow-
up. Therefore, there was a substantial amount of time for cases
to develop. Nevertheless, ER− tumors are not the predominant
type in breast cancer cases, and so there was some constraint
on statistical power. Dietary information was self-reported us-
ing validated FFQs. While some amount of inaccuracy in re-
porting cannot be avoided and the FFQ cannot precisely deter-
mine absolute intake, the FFQs used were validated and were
adequate in ranking individuals according to their level of in-
take (36). In all studies, ER− breast cancer cases were identified
or confirmed through cancer registries, or clinical or pathology
records.
A healthy diet may reduce the development of ER− breast
cancer through several mechanisms. The abundance of dietary
fiber, antioxidants, and vitamins may suppress inflammatory
responses, neutralize free radicals, and prevent DNA damage
(37, 38). The favorable association may also be mediated by
weight management because higher adiposity has been identi-
fied as a risk factor of breast cancer. In addition, the Mediter-
ranean diet has been shown to improve insulin resistance and
glycemic control (39), which are more strongly associated with
ER− than with ER+ breast cancer (40, 41).

Out of the 8 diet quality scores examined in the studies in-
cluded in this review, 6 showed a significant inverse associa-
tion with ER− breast cancer. In addition to the heterogeneity
of score construction, the mixed results might be due to rel-
evant diet components not captured by these scores, residual
confounding, or a true null association between the diet quality
scores investigated and risk of postmenopausal ER− breast can-
cer. Additional studies are needed to determine what healthy diet

characteristics are most strongly associated with a lower risk of
ER− breast cancer.

The primary limitation of this review is the few number of
studies for each diet score. Although there were 7 studies, none
of the diet scores was examined in >2 studies except for the
Mediterranean diet score, and the heterogeneity of score con-
struction made it difficult to compare the results across studies.
Whereas most studies included were cohort studies, one study
used a case-control study design. In addition, results were based
on different categorization of diet quality scores and reference
groups. The studies in this systematic review are observational
studies; therefore, causal relationships cannot be directly es-
tablished. There may also be some level of recall bias in the
case-control study included in this review because cases were
interviewed after cancer diagnosis.

In conclusion, this systematic review showed mixed results
for an association between a variety of diet quality scores and
postmenopausal ER− cancer. However, results from versions of
the Mediterranean diet scores were more consistent in suggest-
ing an inverse association.

ABSTRACT Although fruits and vegetables have been implicated in the etiology of pancreatic cancer, the role of
phytochemicals in these food groups has received little attention to date. In this study, we investigated the possible
association between dietary carotenoids and pancreatic cancer risk. A case-control study of 462 histologically
conﬁrmed pancreatic cancer cases and 4721 population-based controls in 8 Canadian provinces took place
between 1994 and 1997. Dietary intake was assessed by a self-administered FFQ. Unconditional logistic regres-
sion was used to assess associations between speciﬁc and total carotenoid intakes and the risk of pancreatic
cancer. All tests of statistical signiﬁcance were 2-sided. After adjustment for age, province, BMI, smoking,
educational attainment, dietary folate, and total energy intake, lycopene, provided mainly by tomatoes, was
associated with a 31% reduction in pancreatic cancer risk among men [odds ratio (OR) ⫽ 0.69; 95% CI: 0.46 – 0.96;
P ⫽ 0.026 for trend] when comparing the highest and lowest quartiles of intake. Both ␤-carotene (OR ⫽ 0.57; 95%
CI: 0.32– 0.99; P ⫽ 0.016 for trend) and total carotenoids (OR ⫽ 0.58; 95% CI: 0.34 –1.00; P ⫽ 0.02 for trend) were
associated with a signiﬁcantly reduced risk among those who never smoked. The results of this study suggest that
a diet rich in tomatoes and tomato-based products with high lycopene content may help reduce pancreatic cancer
risk.

Pancreatic cancer is the 4th leading cause of cancer-related
deaths in both men and women in Canada (1). Survival is
extremely low worldwide, with a 5-y survival rate of ⬍5% (2),
and a case fatality proportion of 99% within 12 mo of diagnosis
(3). Several epidemiologic studies suggested that high con-
sumption of fruits and vegetables, which are major sources of
carotenoids, may play a role in the prevention of pancreatic
cancer. Substantial evidence from experimental investigations
showed that carotenoids precipitate cancer-preventing events,
including antioxidant activity, enhancement of immune func-
tion, stimulation of gap junctional intercellular communica-
tion, induction of detoxifying enzymes, and inhibition of cel-
lular proliferation (4,5). It was suggested that ␣-carotene

suppresses cytochrome P450 1A1, an activator of procarcino-
gens (6). ␤-Carotene may control growth-inhibitory and pro-
apoptotic effects in cancer cells through the redox regulation
of the nuclear transcription factor NF-␬B activity (7). Lyco-
pene is the most efﬁcient singlet oxygen quencher in vitro (8);
lutein and zeaxanthin are scavengers of radical oxygen species
(4), whereas ␤-cryptoxanthin may stimulate the expression of
RB, an anti-oncogene and p73, a p53-related gene (9).

Despite the mechanistic hypotheses suggesting that intake
of carotenoids may be related to reduced pancreatic cancer
risk, no epidemiologic studies have addressed this issue to date.
The present case-control study was undertaken to investigate
the possible association between the intake of speciﬁc and
total carotenoids and pancreatic cancer risk within the Cana-
dian National Enhanced Cancer Surveillance System
(NECSS).3 This study also examined the modifying effect of
smoking on the association between dietary carotenoid intake
and pancreatic cancer risk because free radicals in cigarette
smoke can alter the concentrations of most carotenoids (10).

DIETARY CAROTENOIDS AND PANCREATIC CANCER RISK

593

SUBJECTS AND METHODS

Study population. The NECSS is a multisite, population-based,
case-control study involving 21,020 participants with 1 of 19 types of
cancer identiﬁed through cancer registries in 8 of the 10 Canadian
provinces, namely, Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, Newfound-
land, Nova Scotia, Ontario, Prince Edward Island, and Saskatche-
wan. The present investigation includes only pancreatic cancer cases,
and is restricted to data obtained from direct interviews. The study
population was described in detail elsewhere (11). Brieﬂy, between
April 1, 1994 and December 31, 1997, participating provincial reg-
istries identiﬁed pancreatic cancer cases as early as possible in the
registration process to minimize the loss of subjects because pancre-
atic cancer is a rapidly fatal disease. All pancreatic cancer cases
included in the NECSS were conﬁrmed histologically, and deﬁned
according to the WHO’s International Classiﬁcation of Diseases,
rubric 157 (12).

Like most other studies of pancreatic cancer that collected infor-
mation directly from case subjects, the overall proportion of eligible
cases that responded was low. Among men diagnosed with pancreatic
cancer, 30% had died before an interview could be conducted, and
consent was not granted by physicians for an additional 15%. For
women, 28% had died before they could be contacted, and the
attending physician refused consent to approach patients for an
additional 16%. The vast majority of cases were ascertained within
1–3 mo of diagnosis; physician consent to send questionnaires to
patients was generally obtained within 1 mo, and ⬃70% of question-
naires were returned within 2 mo of mailing. Response rates of
eligible cases were 55% for men and 56% for women.

The NECSS used frequency matching in selecting the control
population to achieve age and gender distributions similar to those of
all cancer cases combined. Based on the projected number of incident
cancer cases by province, the questionnaires were mailed to 8117
subjects during the 1996 calendar year using the same protocol as for
cases. Questionnaires were not returned for 573 controls (7.4%)
because of incorrect or changed addresses. Strategies for control
selection varied by province, depending on data accessibility. In
Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and
British Columbia, provincial health insurance plans were tapped to
obtain a random sample of the provincial population stratiﬁed by age
and gender. In each of these provinces, ⬎95% of residents are
covered by public health care plans. Active military personnel and
their families as well as indigenous peoples were excluded because
they were covered by other plans. In Ontario, Ministry of Finance
data were used to derive a stratiﬁed random sample, whereas New-
foundland and Alberta adopted a random digit-dialing method to
enroll a population-based sample of controls. A total of 5039 controls
were selected to serve as a common control group for all types of
cancer. Response rates of 65 and 71% were achieved from the male
and female control populations, respectively.

Questionnaires, with telephone follow-up for clariﬁcation when
necessary, were mailed to study subjects to obtain information on
residential and occupational histories and other risk factors for can-
cer. The NECSS questionnaire included questions on smoking his-
tory, height, weight, physical activity, and education attainment.
This research was approved by the ethics committee of Health
Canada and written, informed consent was obtained from each study
subject.

Dietary assessment. Food consumption data were obtained via a
semiquantitative FFQ derived from 2 instruments developed in the
United States that have been widely validated previously, i.e., the
short Block questionnaire (13) and the Willett questionnaire (14).
Subtle changes were made to the questionnaire items to take into
account differences in American and Canadian dietary practices. The
FFQ includes questions on 69 different food and beverage items,
including the frequency of consumption and the amounts consumed.
Participants were asked how often they had consumed these foods per
week in the time period 2 y before interview.

Food and beverage items were retrieved from the FFQ and used to
estimate the daily intake of individual carotenoids, based on the
USDA-Nutrition Coordinating Center (NCC) Carotenoid Database
(15). This online database provides food composition values for 6
speciﬁc carotenoids contained in food and beverage items included in

the study questionnaire. Information on other nutrients, including
total carotenoids, dietary folate, and total energy, was obtained
through the 1997 Canadian Nutrient File.

Data were collected for 475 cases (264 men, 211 women) and
5039 controls (2547 men, 2492 women). We excluded controls
⬍ 30 y of age (n ⫽ 237) because pancreatic cancer cases are usually
ⱖ30 y old. Furthermore, subjects with daily energy intake ⬍ 500 kcal
(2.092 MJ) (10 cases and 54 controls) or ⬎ 5000 kcal (20.92 MJ) (3
cases and 27 controls) were excluded because such intakes are unre-
alistic and hence of questionable validity. Finally, a total of 462 cases
(258 men, 204 women) and 4721 frequency-matched controls (2331
men, 2390 women) were eligible for analysis.

Statistical analysis. Food intake among cases and controls was
analyzed according to carotenoid intake based on the USDA-NCC
Carotenoid Database and the Canadian Nutrient File noted previ-
ously. Mean intakes were calculated separately for cases and controls.
To compare the study population characteristics, we used the ␹2 test
or Mantel extension test for categorical variables and the paired t test
for continuous variables. To evaluate associations between carot-
enoids and pancreatic cancer risk, the study subjects were divided
into 4 categories on the basis of quartiles of total and each speciﬁc
energy-adjusted carotenoid intake in the control population. Odds
ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs were calculated using unconditional logis-
tic regression. Analyses were adjusted for matching variables (age
group and province), lifetime cigarette consumption (0, ⬎0 –15, and
⬎15 pack-y), BMI (⬍25, 25–29.9, and ⱖ30 kg/m2), educational
attainment (y), dietary folate, and total energy intake.

To evaluate the combined effect of intake of individual carot-
enoids and selected lifestyle variables (smoking, BMI, age, and edu-
cational attainment), the P-value for a multiplicative interaction
term added to a fully adjusted model was examined; when it was
signiﬁcant, the analysis was stratiﬁed on that variable. Tests for linear
trend in the carotenoid variables included in logistic regression were
performed by replacing the indicator variables in each multivariate
model with a single variable representing the median frequency of
consumption for a given intake category, and by using the Wald ␹2
value computed for the regression coefﬁcient of this variable to test
the null hypothesis of no linear trend in pancreatic cancer risk across
quartiles of intake. This analysis focused on carotenoid intake from
diet, rather from speciﬁc carotenoid supplements. At the time the
study was conducted, questions about the consumption of such sup-
plements were not included in the FFQ. Models were ﬁt for men and
women separately. All tests of statistical signiﬁcance were 2-sided and
P-values ⬍ 0.05 were considered signiﬁcant. All analyses were con-
ducted using SPSS statistical software (release 10.02, SPSS).

RESULTS

Selected characteristics of the study population are pre-
sented (Table 1). In both men and women, there were appre-
ciable differences between cases and controls for age distribu-
tions with an excess of younger control subjects (P ⬍ 0.05); in
addition, cases were more likely to use high amounts of to-
bacco (P ⬍ 0.01). Two years before the diagnosis of cancer,
there was a higher pancreatic cancer risk with increased BMI
in both genders (P ⬍ 0.05). Among men, cases were more
likely to have greater total energy intake than controls (P
⬍ 0.01).

The main food sources of ␣-carotene in the diet were
carrots and tomatoes. ␤-Carotene was derived primarily from
potatoes, carrots, and spinach. ␤-Cryptoxanthin was supplied
by oranges and fruit juices, whereas lycopene was mainly from
tomatoes, tomato juice, and tomato sauce. Lutein ⫹ zeaxan-
thin were from broccoli and green-leaf vegetables, and total
carotenoids were mainly from potatoes, carrots, and canta-
loupes.

The ORs and corresponding 95% CIs for pancreatic cancer
according to speciﬁc and total carotenoid intakes are summa-
rized (Table 2). After adjustment for age, province, educa-
tional attainment, smoking, BMI, folate, and total energy

pancreatic cancer risk and lycopene intake in men (OR

There was evidence of an interaction between tobacco use
and ␤-carotene (P ⫽ 0.02) as well as total carotenoids (P
⫽ 0.013). The risk of pancreatic cancer in relation to intake
of carotenoids is presented by level of tobacco consumption
(Table 3). Among those who never smoked, inverse dose-
response relations were apparent between ␤-carotene (OR

carotenoids (OR ⫽ 0.58; 95% CI: 0.34 –1.00; P ⫽ 0.02 for

with the lowest quartile of intakes. These results did not differ
among subgroups deﬁned by pack-years of cigarette smoking.
Overall, there was no signiﬁcant effect modiﬁcation by BMI,
age, physical activity, and educational attainment (data not
shown).

DISCUSSION

This population-based case-control study demonstrated an
inverse dose-response relation between lycopene and pancre-
atic cancer in men. Intakes of ␤-carotene and total carot-
enoids were signiﬁcantly associated with reduced pancreatic
cancer risk among those who never smoked. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the ﬁrst epidemiologic study to examine the
role of speciﬁc dietary carotenoids in risk assessment of pan-
creatic cancer.

Previous observational investigations assessed the relation
between lycopene serum concentrations and pancreatic cancer
with consistent results. A case-control study found that plasma
lycopene levels were signiﬁcantly lower in pancreatic cancer
cases than in matched controls (16). In the Washington
County Cohort Study, in which subjects were followed for
almost 15 y, signiﬁcantly lower baseline serum lycopene levels
were documented in subjects with pancreatic cancer than in
matched cohort controls (17,18). Lower serum lycopene levels
were observed in individuals with certain chronic diseases,
including cancer, suggesting that lycopene intake reduces the
occurrence, extent, or degree of these conditions, or that
lycopene is depleted by oxidative stress and inﬂammatory
processes (19). Interestingly, in vitro studies suggest that ly-
copene inhibits gap junction communication (20), activates
phase II enzymes (21), suppresses eicosanoid metabolism by
blocking cyclooxygenase-2 synthesis (22), and inhibits tumor
cell growth by repressing insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor
activation (23). However, these putative mechanisms remain
speculative and require conﬁrmation.

We observed a 42% reduction in pancreatic risk in relation
to both ␤-carotene and total carotenoids among those who
never smoked, but no clear evidence of an association between
any individual or total carotenoid intakes and pancreatic can-
cer risk among past or current smokers. Exposure to tobacco
smoke causes extensive ␤-carotene oxidation (24). It was
reported that cigarette smoking is independently associated
with lowered circulating concentrations of provitamin A carot-
enoids: in general, active smokers have ⬎25% lower circulat-
ing concentrations of ␣-carotene, ␤-carotene, and ␤-crypto-
xanthin than nonsmokers, even after adjusting for dietary

intake and other demographic factors (10,25). Moreover, de-
pressed plasma ␤-carotene concentrations were reported in
response to enhanced metabolic turnover resulting from smok-
ing-induced oxidative stress (26). If this putative oxidative
mechanism can be shown to affect the relation between ␤-car-
otene and smoking, it would help explain why ␤-carotene and
total carotenoids, which come from similar sources, were as-
sociated with a reduced pancreatic cancer risk in this study
only among those who never smoked.

The major strengths of our study include its uniqueness, the
large number of pancreatic cancer cases, histological diagnosis

of pancreatic cancer cases, and general population sampling.
Ours is the ﬁrst study to examine the role of dietary carotenoid
intakes in risk assessment of pancreatic cancer. The large
sample size permitted subgroup analyses by sex and smoking
status. Histological conﬁrmation of diagnosis reduced the pos-
sibility of disease misclassiﬁcation, whereas the population-
based approach to subject selection facilitated extrapolation of
our results to the general population.

Our study is also subject to certain limitations. Because the
assessment of dietary exposure was retrospective, recall bias
cannot be completely excluded. A prospective cohort ap-

proach has several advantages when studying associations be-
tween nutritional factors and cancer risk. However, because of
the relatively low incidence of pancreatic cancer, the largest
cohort to date examining diet and pancreatic cancer risk
included only 178 pancreatic cancer cases throughout 18 y of
follow-up (27). We could not adjust OR estimates for the
potentially confounding effect of diabetes mellitus and family
history of pancreatic cancer because this information was not
collected at baseline. Nevertheless, we expect that diabetes did
not confound the association between dietary carotenoids and
pancreatic cancer risk because diet is likely to be an initial risk
factor for both chronic diseases, rather than lying on their
causal pathways. In addition, it was suggested that the impor-
tance of diabetes is much reduced if pancreatic cancer cases of
recent onset are excluded (28). In addition, it is unlikely that
the confounding effect of family aggregation of pancreatic
cancer may explain the associations we found because genetic/
familial predisposition is relatively rare (29). Moreover,
conﬁrmation of a hereditary component is particularly chal-
lenging because pancreatic cancer may occur only infre-
quently in some of the hereditary cancer syndromes, in
accordance with reduced frequency of the deleterious, pre-
disposing mutations (30).

Although the USDA-NCC Carotenoid Database used in
the present analysis represents the most current and compre-
hensive data available to date, data were not available for all
of the Canadian food items we investigated. In addition, the
carotenoid content of foods is highly variable depending on a
number of factors, including geographical area and growing
conditions, cultivar or variety, processing techniques, method
of food preparation, and length and conditions of storage (4).
As a consequence, the likelihood of nondifferential misclassi-
ﬁcation cannot be completely excluded, raising the possibility
that some associations were obscured.

Another limitation is the consequence of early and high
case fatality associated with the disease. As in other epidemi-
ologic studies of pancreatic cancer, cases who died before the
questionnaire could be administered were not included in the
analysis. Bias may have been introduced in the present inves-
tigation if rapidly fatal cases had a different etiology from cases
with longer survival, or if the dietary carotenoids under study
inﬂuenced survival. However, because there was no discrimi-
nation in the selection of study subjects based on their demo-
graphic characteristics and lifestyle factors, such as age, dietary

patterns, smoking, or educational attainment, survivors are
still representative of the study population. Consequently,
selection bias is unlikely to be substantial.

In conclusion, we found a signiﬁcantly reduced pancreatic
cancer risk with dietary intake of lycopene among men. A
signiﬁcant inverse association was also observed between pan-
creatic cancer risk and both dietary ␤-carotene and total
carotenoid intakes among those who never smoked. As a
whole, our data supported the association of a diet rich in
vegetables with a reduction in risk of pancreatic cancer. More
studies assessing associations between dietary carotenoids and
the risk of pancreatic cancer are warranted to better elucidate
the role of diet in the etiology of pancreatic cancer.

It has been estimated by various authorities that about one-third of cancers in Western
high-income societies are attributable to factors relating to food, nutrition and physical activity.
Identifying with conﬁdence speciﬁc associations between dietary patterns,
foods, body
composition or individual nutrients is not simple because of the long latent period for cancer
development,
its complex pathogenesis and the challenge of characterising the multi-
dimensional aspects of diet and activity over a lifetime. Reliable conclusions must therefore
be drawn not only from randomised controlled trials but from a variety of methodological
approaches,
judged within a classic framework for inferring causality. Using a newly-
developed method with a protocol for standardising the literature search and for analysis and
display of the evidence, nine independent academic centres have conducted systematic reviews
addressing the causal associations between food, nutrition and physical activity and risk of
development of seventeen cancers, as well as of weight gain and obesity. A review has also
examined the efﬁcacy of such interventions in subjects with cancer. The reviews have been
assessed by an independent Panel of twenty-one international experts who drew conclusions
with grades of conﬁdence in the causality of associations and made recommendations.
Recommendations are given as public health goals as well as for individuals.

Cancer prevention: Systematic literature reviews: Expert recommendations

In the UK cancer accounts for about one-quarter of all
deaths, second only to CVD(1). Although survival
is
increasing with improved management, many cancers still
carry a poor prognosis as they are less susceptible to sur-
gical, radiotherapeutic or chemotherapeutic intervention,
either because of their inherent characteristics or because
they may be detected at a late stage of development.

The most common cancers are diseases of adulthood,
becoming especially more common in older age. As the
population ages cancer prevalence is therefore predicted to
increase. Consequently, a policy of managing the burden of
cancer in the population based entirely on screening for
early detection and management of detected cancers is
unlikely to make a marked impact at a population level

except for a few types of cancer, and is also likely to be
increasingly, and unsustainably, expensive.

Thus, it is important to consider the role for primary
prevention in helping to reduce the clinical, personal,
economic and social burden of cancer. Approximately one-
third of all cancers in high-income countries such as the
UK are attributed to smoking(2). Authoritative reviews
have further estimated that about one-third of all cancers
in such countries might be attributable to factors relating
to food, nutrition and physical activity, including body

Nutrition and the Prevention of Cancer: a Global
Perspective(3). This report has become the most author-
itative statement on the topic and a basis for academics,
researchers and policy-makers worldwide, and has been
followed by a surge in research on the nutritional links
with cancer.

In view of the burgeoning body of evidence, in 2001
WCRF and American Institute for Cancer Research
embarked on a new report to ensure that its recommend-
ations remained a sound basis for its own and others’
activities. This report was published in November 2007(4).

Nutrition and the cancer process

Cancer develops from a clone of cells that have escaped
normal regulation of growth, proliferation, differentiation
and intercellular
relationships. These abnormalities of
function derive from disordered expression of key genes,
resulting in altered cellular phenotype. The disordered
gene expression may result from genetic mutation or from
epigenetic factors that may silence genes that should be
active or switch on genes that should be silent. Factors
relating to food and nutrition may directly inﬂuence both
processes.

Food components may act directly as mutagens, or
conversely may interfere with the action of external
mutagens either directly or by facilitating their elimination.
Nutritional factors may also alter the cellular milieu by
modulating hormonal axes, and so inﬂuencing growth and
proliferation amongst speciﬁc cell populations. Finally,
regulation of processes related to speciﬁc nutrients may
directly inﬂuence the expression of key genes, for instance
through abnormalities of methylation of
the promoter
regions of genes or of histone acetylation, which can
inﬂuence DNA structure and accessibility of genes to
mRNA for transcription.

interaction between genotype

While it is clear that at root cancer is a disease of gene
expression, only a minority of cancers appear to be related
to inherited single high-penetrance gene mutations. Con-
sequently, a major determinant of cancer risk appears to be
the
and environment.
Amongst the earliest identiﬁed indicators of the importance
of this interaction are the different patterns of cancer
around the world. Low-income countries have relatively
high rates of cancers of the cervix, stomach, liver and
oro-pharynx (all of which are at least partly related to
infections), while high-income countries are characterised
by higher rates of cancers of the breast, prostate and colo-
rectum (related to alterations in hormonal axes)(4). Most
striking is the rapid change in cancer patterns, within one
or two generations, when populations migrate. Together
with the secular changes in the incidence of some cancers
over only decades, this rapid change effectively excludes
inherited factors as a key determinant of these patterns at a
population level, although clearly they may be important in
determining individual risk within populations.

The rationale for considering food, nutrition and physi-
cal activity as key environmental factors in determining
cancer risk derives from a mass of epidemiological and
mechanistic data, and more recently with some clinical
trials as well. The second WCRF/American Institute for

Cancer Research report was commissioned with an expert
Panel to review this evidence, to draw conclusions and to
make recommendations.

The process for the report

Cancer is the result of a complex process of accumulation
of abnormal phenotypic characteristics among a clone of
cells, usually over decades. This complexity and timescale
present obstacles to the study of its pathogenesis and
natural history, especially during the preclinical stages.
Equally, it is challenging to characterise subjects’ exposure
to food and nutrients, and their trajectory of growth and
body composition, over the life course. In these circum-
stances, clinical
trials cannot realistically address more
than a short period of the whole pathogenetic process and
are usually conducted in high-risk groups who may not be
representative of the general population. Often dietary
intervention is in the form of isolated supplements rather
than real foods, as it is difﬁcult to achieve or maintain
differences between intervention and control groups for
real dietary or physical activity interventions.

Consequently, it is difﬁcult to identify single methodo-
logical approaches that can be seen as inherently superior.
With a body of evidence comprising very different
approaches,
from observational epidemiology to basic
science, and where the generalisability of clinical trials is
limited, robust conclusions can only be drawn from a
review of the totality of the relevant evidence, allowing for
the advantages and disadvantages of different methods.
There are accepted approaches to synthesising such evi-
dence and inferring the likely causality of observed associ-
ations, such as that proposed in 1963 by Bradford Hill(5).
With a view to exploring the literature so that Bradford
Hill’s framework could be applied, WCRF International
convened an expert Task Force to develop a standardised
method for searching the literature and for analysing and
displaying the evidence. This methodology Task Force met
over 2 years to develop such a speciﬁcation.

The feasibility, utility and reproducibility of the speciﬁ-
cation manual was tested and compared between two
independent academic institutes, using endometrial cancer
as a test case. As a result amendments were made to the
protocol, and the ﬁnal version(6) was used to conduct the
series of systematic literature reviews (SLR) that formed
the basis of the Panel’s deliberations.

It was decided to keep the process of data collection,
analysis and display separate from that of judging it. Thus,
nine independent SLR centres, three in the USA, four in
the UK and two in continental Europe, were commissioned
to conduct SLR on the links between food, nutrition and
physical activity and seventeen cancer sites. In addition,
SLR were conducted on the links with weight gain and
body fatness and the efﬁcacy of nutrition and activity
interventions in individuals who had already received
a diagnosis of cancer. Finally, a review was conducted
on authoritative national and international reports that
had made recommendations for the prevention of other
diseases, so that any recommendations from this report
would be set in a broad public health context.

Nutrition support in cancer therapy

255

Each SLR team had to include a range of expertise,
in nutrition, epidemiology, statistics, cancer biology, the
speciﬁc cancer site and systematic review. Each SLR was
peer reviewed at the protocol and draft ﬁnal report stage.
WCRF International provided a coordinator whose role
was to facilitate the process and ensure consistency in
application of the speciﬁcation.

An expert Panel was convened, comprising twenty-one
internationally-renowned scientists, with a range of exper-
tise including nutrition, epidemiology, cancer mechanisms,
clinical medicine and public health. Chaired by Professor
Sir Michael Marmot, the Panel met over 5 years to discuss
and judge the evidence from the SLR, to draw conclusions
and to make recommendations.

Judging the evidence

Given the complex nature both of the disease process of
cancer and of the characterisation of diet and physical
activity over a lifetime, a simple hierarchical approach
to evidence on causal links cannot rely on randomised
controlled trials. Apart from the obvious inability to mask
differences in dietary interventions based on real foods, in
practical terms it is equally impossible to secure sufﬁ-
ciently large or sustained differences in lifestyle including
diet between intervention groups. Where such studies are
done they often use synthetic supplements of isolated
nutrients, at high dose, in high-risk groups, with inter-
mediate outcomes. Extrapolation from such studies to
the general population is not
therefore straightforward.
However, long-term observational studies of cohorts of
healthy individuals can identify hard outcomes (cancer
incidence or mortality) in typical populations consuming
real diets over decades. Observational studies, however,
unlike randomised trials, are subject
to confounding,
making causal inferences less robust.

The issue of identifying important causal associations
from predominantly observational data where trials are
uninformative is not new. Bradford Hill
in the 1960s
elucidated a series of characteristics of the data that could
provide a framework for consideration to help infer which
associations are likely to be causal(7). The SLR speciﬁc-
ation required the data to be displayed in a way that
facilitated the application of Bradford Hill’s criteria. The
evidence displayed was then judged within that framework,
and the likelihood of any association being causal was
graded according to how well the criteria were fulﬁlled.

Before any evidence was presented, the Panel agreed a
set of minimum criteria for each grade. The grades were:
convincing; probable; limited; substantial effect on risk
unlikely. The limited category was further divided into
where it was suggestive of a causal relation and where no
conclusion could be drawn. In addition, to provide ﬂexi-
bility, certain characteristics of the evidence could be used
to upgrade or downgrade conclusions.

Once conclusions were reached, they were presented
graphically in the form of a matrix. Matrices were pre-
sented for each cancer, with all
identiﬁed exposures
categorised according to the grade of conclusion as to the
likely causality of the association. In addition, matrices
were presented for each main group of exposures, with

to their likely causality (although excluding the large
category of limited–no conclusion).

Once agreed, these conclusions provided the basis for
making recommendations. Recommendations were based
only on conclusions for which the likely causality was
judged probable or convincing.

Making recommendations

Recommendations were developed by the Panel with the
aim of being as far as possible applicable throughout the
world. Where evidence was speciﬁc to particular local
circumstances this fact was stated. In addition, all recom-
mendations were considered within the context of the
review of authoritative expert reports on other diseases, to
ensure that they were conducive generally to public health
and not restricted to cancer prevention.

The Panel made ten recommendations. Each recom-
mendation has a title to identify the broad category of
food, nutrition or physical activity addressed. This title is
followed by a brief headline to provide a sense of the
essence of the recommendation, but without detail or
quantiﬁcation. Each recommendation then has a public
health goal or goals, directed to policy-makers or health
professionals with the aim of facilitating policies or pro-
grammes and quantiﬁed to aid target setting and monitor-
ing of progress. This public health goal is followed by
personal recommendations as a basis for the population (as
communities, families or individuals) to make decisions
about their own diet and lifestyle, also quantiﬁed where
possible.

Each of these recommendations is accompanied by
explanatory footnotes, which should be considered an
integral part of the recommendation.

The headline recommendations are shown in Table 1.

Looking to the future

The conclusions and recommendations of the Panel set out
in the report form a robust basis for further research and
for public and professional education programmes. WCRF
is preparing materials and other resources that begin this
process.

However, scientiﬁc evidence is continually accumulat-
ing, and each new study needs to be considered in the
context of the existing evidence. Thus, WCRF has com-
missioned a group from Imperial College, London, UK to
combine the existing databases produced by the cancer-site
SLR, and to update them as new information accrues. This
process is overseen by a panel of independent experts, and
will be accompanied by periodic reports of updated con-
clusions and of the implications for the recommendations.
Furthermore, while food, nutrition and physical activity
are proximate causes of patterns of cancer, and of other
chronic diseases,
is clear that patterns of food con-
sumption and of activity are themselves determined by
powerful social, cultural, political and economic factors.
A further report to be published in November 2008 will
address the evidence for determinants of such patterns
and for what might be effective in inﬂuencing them. This
report, Policy and Action for Cancer Prevention: Food,
Nutrition, and Physical Activity – a Global Perspective,
will explore the evidence in a similarly rigorous way and
make further recommendations for policies and actions to
politicians, policy-makers, health professionals and others.

White Button Mushroom (AgaricusBisporus) Exhibits
Antiproliferative and Proapoptotic Properties and Inhibits
Prostate Tumor Growth in Athymic Mice

White button mushrooms are a widely consumed food contain-
ing phytochemicals beneﬁcial to cancer prevention. The purpose
of this research was to evaluate the effects of white button mush-
room extract and its major component, conjugated linoleic acid
(CLA) on prostate cancer cell lines in vitro and mushroom extract
in vivo. In all cell lines tested, mushroom inhibited cell prolifer-
ation in a dose-dependent manner and induced apoptosis within
72 h of treatment. CLA inhibited proliferation in the prostate can-
cer cell lines in vitro. DU145 and PC3 prostate tumor size and
tumor cell proliferation were decreased in nude mice treated with
mushroom extract, whereas tumor cell apoptosis was increased
compared to pair-fed controls. Microarray analysis of tumors iden-
tiﬁed signiﬁcant changes in gene expression in the mushroom-fed
mice as compared to controls. Gene network analysis identiﬁed
alterations in networks involved in cell death, growth and prolif-
eration, lipid metabolism, the TCA cycle and immune response.
The data provided by this study illustrate the anticancer potential
of phytochemicals in mushroom extract both in vitro and in vivo
and supports the recommendation of white button mushroom as
a dietary component that may aid in the prevention of prostate
cancer in men.

BACKGROUND

The majority of common dietary constituents do not have
an acute biological effect immediately after ingestion. How-
ever, when eaten daily over a lifetime, subtle, long-term effects
may be observed. For this reason, cancer of the prostate, which
requires many years to develop, is a prime target for preven-
tion strategies utilizing daily factors such as dietary intake. It
is estimated that the time required for the clonal outgrowth of
a prostate cancer cell to develop into a 1 cm3 primary prostate
cancer would be 39.4 yr, with the mean age at diagnosis occur-
ring at 72 yr of age (1). Epidemiologic studies have suggested

that changes in lifestyle, including dietary modiﬁcations, could
prevent a signiﬁcant number of cancers (2–4). Of the environ-
mental factors that affect prostate cancer development, diet has
been identiﬁed as an important inﬂuence (5,6). Therefore, incor-
porating foods into the diet that are known to have chemopreven-
tive properties could reduce cancer incidence and subsequently
cancer-related deaths.

Several mushroom species such as Ganoderma lucidum,
Lentinus edodes, Grifola frondosa and Agaricus blazei have
been shown to exhibit anticancer effects such as the inhibition of
cell proliferation in prostate (7,8), colon (9–11), and breast can-
cer cell lines (10,12). Mechanisms attributed to the anticancer
activity of mushrooms include the induction of apoptosis; the
inhibition of angiogenesis and prosurvival signaling pathways
such as protein kinase B (AKT), extracellular-regulated
kinase (ERK), nuclear factor kappa-B (NF6-B) and activating
protein-1 (AP-1) (7,13,14) and modulation of the cell cycle
control protein retinoblastoma (pRb) (8). Although much study
has been completed on the medicinal varieties of mushroom
mentioned above, studies into the anticancer effects of the com-
mon white button mushroom (Agaricus bisporus) are limited.
Much of the research has focused on the anticancer effects
of carbohydrate fractions of this species. For example, lectins
isolated from the white button mushroom have been shown to
increase the sensitivity of lung, colon, and glioblastoma cancer
cells to chemotherapeutic drugs (15), inhibit colon cancer cell
proliferation (16), and enhance cellular antioxidant defense
mechanisms (17).

Previous studies in our laboratory investigated the antiaro-
matase activity of common vegetables that may suppress breast
cancer cell proliferation. Of the 7 vegetable extracts tested, the
extract of white button mushrooms was the most effective in-
hibitor of human placental aromatase activity (18). Our labora-
tory has focused on an ethyl acetate extract of the white button
mushroom, which contains mainly C-18 fatty acids and simple
organic and phenolic acids (19). We have previously reported
that this extract effectively decreased the proliferation of breast
cancer cells through the inhibition of aromatase enzyme activity.

We also identiﬁed CLA as a major component of the mushroom
extract and also an active inhibitor of breast cancer cell prolif-
eration and aromatase activity (18,19).

To determine the anticancer potential of mushroom extract
in prostate cancer cell lines, the current study investigated the in
vitro effects of this extract on the androgen sensitive LNCaP and
androgen insensitive PC3 and DU145 prostate cancer cell lines.
We also studied the in vivo chemopreventive potential of mush-
room extract in two separate studies utilizing male athymic mice
injected with either DU145 or PC3 prostate cancer cell lines.
The information gained from this study gives us future direc-
tion for investigation into the active ingredients of mushrooms
as well as their mechanisms and to the overall understanding
of how inclusion of mushrooms into the diet may contribute to
more effective prostate cancer prevention strategies.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Cell Culture

LNCaP, PC3, and DU145 cell lines were obtained from
American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Rockville, MD) and
grown in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum in the
presence of 100 U/ml penicillin and 0.1 g/l streptomycin. Cells
◦
C with 95% air and 5% carbon dioxide.
were incubated at 37
All cells were kept below passage 20 and used in experiments
during the linear phase of growth.

Production of Mushroom Extract

Mushroom extract was produced by chopping 60 g of fresh
white button mushroom (Agaricus bisporus) and boiling it in
water. The broth was ﬁltered and then applied to 5 g/60 ml
capacity polyamide columns (Discovery DPA-6S SPE; Supelco,
Bellefonte, PA). Fractions were eluted by a step gradient (50
ml of each step) of increasing methanol to water. The 20%
methanol–water fraction was rotor evaporated to dryness and
then redissolved in 1 ml of water to produce the 6× mushroom
extract. Therefore, 6 g of mushroom can produce 100 µl of 6 ×
fraction.

Real-Time Proliferation Assay

Cells were plated in 16 well plates at a density of 10,000 cells/
well and treated with either medium containing ethanol as ve-
hicle control (<0.1% total) or CLA (Cayman Chemical, Ann
Arbor, MI; 0–200 µM). Cell growth was monitored automat-
ically via the ACEA RT-CES real-time proliferation machine
(ACEA Biosciences, Inc., San Diego, CA), which swept the
plates once an hour for up to 96 h. The machine measures elec-
trical impedance through sensors on the bottom of the 16 well
plates. Increase in impedance correlates with an increase in cell
density. Media and treatments were changed after 48 h. Data are
expressed as ratio of treated to untreated cells mean ± SE for 3
replications.

Apoptosis ELISA

Apoptosis was assessed utilizing the Cell Death Detection
ELISAPLUS Assay (Boehringer Mannheim, Indianapolis, IN).
This assay is a photometric enzyme-linked immunoassay that
quantitatively measures the internucleosomal degradation of
DNA, which occurs during apoptosis. The assay is a quanti-
tative sandwich-enzyme-immunoassay utilizing monoclonal
mouse antibodies directed against DNA and histones that
detect speciﬁcally mononucleosomes and oligonucleosomes.
Quantitative measurement of the amount of internucleosomal
degradation is measured photometrically at 405 nm with ABTS
as substrate. Cells were plated in 60 mm dishes (Falcon, BD
Biosciences, San Jose, CA) at a density of 100,000 cells/dish
and allowed to attach for 24 h. Cells were treated with media
control (mushroom extract is water soluble) or mushroom
extract at a concentration of 20 µl/ml for 48 and 72 h. Following
treatments, nonadherent cells were collected and pelleted at
200 g for 10 min. The supernatant was discarded; the cell pellet
was washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 137
mmol/l sodium chloride, 1.5 mmol/l potassium phosphate, 7.2
mmol/l sodium phosphate, 2.7 mmol/l potassium chloride, pH
7.4) and recentrifuged. Adherent cells were washed with cold
PBS, trypsinized, collected, and combined with nonadherent
cells. Both live and dead cells were then counted via Trypan
Blue (Pierce, Rockford, IL) exclusion, and 10,000 cells were
added to the microtiter plate for all treatment groups; and
apoptosis assay was performed according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Absorbance was read on a SpectraMax M5
plate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) at 405 nm.
Background values were subtracted from readings (media plus
reagent, no cells) and expressed as absorbance of dye bound to
antibodies bound to mononucleosomes and oligonucleosomes
at 405 nm of each treated sample divided by media controls.

Annexin V Assay

Cells were plated in 100 mm dishes (Falcon, BD Biosciences,
San Jose, CA) at a density of 50,000 cells/dish and allowed to
attach for 72 h. Cells were treated with media control (mushroom
extract is water soluble) or mushroom extract at a concentration
of 20 µl/ml for 48 and 72 h. Following treatments, adherent
cells were trypsinized, nonadherent cells were collected, and
all cells were pelleted at 200 g for 10 min and then washed
twice with cold 1 × PBS and resuspended in 1 ml of 1 ×
binding buffer (10 mM HEPES/NaOH pH 7.4, 140 mM NaCl,
2.5 mM CaCl2) at a concentration of 1 × 106 cells/ml. 1 × 105
cells were stained with Annexin V-FITC; BD Pharmingen, San
Jose, CA) and propidium iodide (PI; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis,
MO) for 15 min at room temperature in the dark. After adding
400 ml of 1 × binding buffer to each tube, cells were analyzed
by ﬂow cytometry within 1 h on a CyAnTM ADP 9color-UV
ﬂow cytometer(Dako, Inc., Carpinteria, CA). Controls included
unstained cells, cells stained with Annexin V-FITC only, and
cells stained with PI only.

Animal Experiments

Five-week-old, male BALB/c Nu-Nu, athymic mice were
purchased (Charles River Laboratories). Mice were randomly
divided into 6 groups with 8 mice per group. At 6 wk of age,
mice were gavage fed with either 100 µl water control or 100 µl
mushroom extract (in water). The third group was gavaged with
100 µl water and pair fed to the 6X mushroom group (the
food consumed by the 6X mushroom group was weighed and
the same amount provided to the pair-fed group) to control
for differences in caloric intake. Each animal received daily
gavage treatment for the duration of the experiment. At 7 wk
of age, mice were given two subcutaneous injections of either
DU145 or PC3 cells in Matrigel (BD Biosciences, San Jose,
CA). These cells were grown in RPMI 1640 with nonessential
amino acids, sodium pyruvate, and Earle’s salts in 10% fetal calf
serum. The cells were harvested and resuspended in an equal
volume of Matrigel (BD Biosciences) to a ﬁnal concentration of
1 × 107 cells/0.2 ml. Body weights were monitored weekly as
an indicator of the animal’s overall health. At the end of 7 wk
of gavage treatment, mice were euthanized; blood samples were
collected; and tumors were removed, weighed, and sent for
hematoxilin and eosin (H & E) histological staining through
the City of Hope Pathology Department Core Facility. Tumor
specimens were also stained using cleaved-caspase-3 antibody
(Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA) for apoptosis and
Ki-67 antibody (Dakocytomation, Carpinteria, CA) staining for
cell proliferation by the City of Hope Pathology Department
Core Facility. Data are expressed as mean ± SEM (n ≥ 5).

Microarray Analysis

For microarray analysis, total RNA was extracted from 3
DU145-derived tumors from each treatment group using TRI-
zol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Synthesis and labeling
of cRNA targets, hybridization of GeneChips, and signal de-
tection were carried out by the Microarray Core Facility at the
City of Hope. Brieﬂy, biotinylated cRNA was generated using
5 µg total RNA using T7 RNA polymerase. The Affymetrix
GeneChip Human Genome U133A v2.0 array (HGU133A2)
(Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) was used to deﬁne gene expres-
sion proﬁles from tumor samples. For microarray hybridization,
the GeneChip arrays were hybridized with 15 µg of fragmented
cRNA targets and then washed. The staining was performed with
streptavidin-PE. Affymetrix GeneChip images were scanned at
11-µm resolution using a high resolution GeneChip Scanner
3000 (Hewlett-Packard).

Statistical Processing of Microarray Data

Quality assessment and statistical analysis of gene expression
data was performed using the R/Bioconductor packages. To en-
sure the high quality of the microarray process, a set of quality
assessment steps implemented in Bioconductor package “Affy-
Express” were applied to the data. Raw intensity measurements

L. S. ADAMS ET AL.

of all probe sets were converted into expression measurements
using the “GCRMA” package. The “LIMMA” package was
then used to identify the genes differentially expressed between
mushroom-fed and water-fed samples. The genes showing al-
tered expression were categorized on the basis of their cellular
components, biological processes, molecular functions, and sig-
nal pathways using the Ingenuity Pathways Analysis (Ingenuity,
Mountain View, CA) software. Signiﬁcant genes were selected
with a cutoff of P < 0.01 and log2 ratio of 1 (twofold change).

Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA)

IPA is a Web-based software program that identiﬁes the bio-
logical functions, pathways, and mechanisms most relevant to a
given data set of genes. Information on individual genes is drawn
from a large knowledge base of biological networks created
from millions of publications (full-text articles published in sci-
entiﬁc journals), and the networks are drawn by the Functional
Analysis feature of IPA based on the connectivity of the genes.

Statistical Analysis

To assess statistical signiﬁcance, values were compared to
controls with either Student’s t-test or 1-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA), followed by Dunnett’s Multiple Range test (α =
0.05) or 2-way ANOVA as appropriate using Prism GraphPad 4
software (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA).

RESULTS

Effects of Mushroom Extract on Prostate Cancer Cell
Proliferation

The antiproliferative activity of mushroom extract was as-
sessed in the LNCaP, DU145, and PC3 prostate cancer cell lines.
Cells were treated with mushroom extract (20 µl/ml) for 96 h.
Results from this assay showed that exposure to mushroom ex-
tract resulted in a signiﬁcant, dose-dependent inhibition of cell
proliferation (P ≤ 0.01) in all cell lines tested. The magnitude

LNCaP (A), DU145 (B), and PC3 (C) cells were plated in the ACEA 16-well
plate (5,000 cells/well) in media alone or treated with indicated concentrations
of mushroom extract. Readings were taken every hour up to 96 h by the ACEA
machine and expressed as cell index (a measure of cell number/well). Data
represent means ± SE (n = 3); * indicates signiﬁcant difference from media

of response to mushroom extract was similar between cell lines
(Fig. 1).

Induction of Apoptosis by Mushroom Extract

To determine whether the observed decrease in cell num-
ber after treatment with mushroom extract was due to the in-
duction of apoptosis, the formation of mononucleosomes and
oligonucleosomes was quantiﬁed using the Cell Death Detection
ELISAPLUS assay (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany)
and Annexin V/PI staining. Following treatment with mushroom
extract (20µl/ml) for 48 h, a signiﬁcant twofold increase in DNA
fragmentation was detected in the LNCaP cells (P ≤ 0.01) com-
pared to untreated controls (Fig. 2A). The PC3 and DU145 cell

lines showed no increase in the production of mononucleosomes
and oligonucleosomes with mushroom treatment compared to
untreated controls at 48 h (Fig. 2A). However, after 72 h of
treatment, mushroom extract signiﬁcantly induced DNA frag-
mentation 4.4-fold in the PC3 cells (P ≤ 0.001) and 1.8-fold in
the DU145 cells (P ≤ 0.001; Fig. 2B).

The translocation of phosphatidylserine (PS) to the outer
leaﬂet of the plasma membrane was determined using Annexin
V-FITC/PI staining and ﬂow cytometry. Changes in the location
of cell surface markers, such as PS, are the earliest detectable
features of apoptotic cells. As such, PS detection in intact cells
(PI negative cells) represent an early stage of apoptosis in the
cell lines tested following exposure to mushroom extract. In
the LNCaP cells, Annexin V positive cells increased 4.4-fold
with mushroom treatment after 48 h compared to untreated
controls (P = 0.025). In PC3 cells treated with mushroom
extract, Annexin V staining increased threefold (P ≤ 0.01),
whereas the DU145 cells exhibited a 1.4-fold increase compared
to untreated controls (Fig. 3A). After 72 h of treatment with
mushroom extract, PC3 cells had a twofold increase in Annexin
V staining (P ≤ 0.02), whereas DU145 cells had a 1.6-fold
increase in Annexin V staining (P ≤ 0.02; Fig. 3B). These
results illustrate that the LNCaP cell line is more sensitive to
the proapoptotic effects of mushroom extract compared to the

ination of the PC3 tumors showed that cell proliferation was
signiﬁcantly decreased 45% in the mushroom group compared
to controls (P ≤ 0.01; Fig. 4C), and the level of apoptosis in-
creased 200% (P ≤ 0.001; Fig. 5C). The LNCaP cell line did
not reliably form tumors when implanted into the athymic mice,
therefore we chose not to utilize that cell line for this study. The
DU145 and PC3 data illustrates the ability of mushroom extract
to decrease the growth and induce apoptosis of prostate cancer
cells in vivo.

In addition, the DU145 cell line showed only a mild response to
mushroom extract and is therefore more resistant than the other
two cell lines. Additionally, this shows that the antiproliferative
activity is distinct from the proapoptotic activity of mushroom,
as all three cell lines responded equally in the proliferation
assay.

Inhibition of Tumor Growth In Vivo

To evaluate the prostate cancer protective effects of white
button mushroom in vivo, our laboratory investigated the ability
of mushroom extract to inhibit PC3 and DU145-derived tu-
mor growth in male, athymic (nu/nu) mice. The results of these
animal experiments showed that the oral intake of mushroom
extract signiﬁcantly decreased DU145 tumor weight 44.5%
(P ≤ 0.05) (Fig. 4A) and PC3 tumor weight 68.6% (P ≤
0.01; Fig. 5A) compared to pair-fed control mice. There was no
difference in mouse weight between treatment groups. Histolog-
ical examination of DU145 tumors revealed that cell prolifera-
tion was signiﬁcantly decreased 25.3% in the mushroom group
compared to controls (P ≤ 0.05; Fig. 4B), whereas the level
of apoptosis between tumors from the control and mushroom
extract-fed animals was increased, although this observation

Through GC analysis, we previously identiﬁed conjugated
linoleic acid isomer 9Z, 11E as a major component in the 6X
mushroom fraction (an average of 45.7% of the total extract).
We also showed that 9Z, 11E CLA alone inhibits breast cancer
cell proliferation through inhibition of the activity of the aro-
matase enzyme (19). Therefore, we tested the ability of the two
common isoforms of CLA (9Z, 11E and 10E, 12Z) to inhibit
prostate cancer cell proliferation. The results indicate that both
isoforms of CLA signiﬁcantly inhibited prostate cancer cell pro-
liferation in a dose dependent manner (9Z, 11E with a P value
≤0.01 and 10E, 12Z with a P value ≤0.05; Figs. 6A–6F), sug-
gesting that CLA may be one of the major active components
in mushroom extract. However, in natural products, it is gener-
ally accepted that the overall combination of components can
be more potent than any one component singled out. Further, it
is possible that one of the minor components could be as active
as CLA; however, in our breast cancer studies, the ethyl acetate
fraction was the most potent fraction, and the major constituent
was found to be CLA.

Validation of Microarray Results by Real-Time PCR

Microarray analysis results were validated by real-time PCR
using primers for three of the most highly regulated and in-
teresting genes (KIT, FAS, and FH) in tumor samples. Results
showed a signiﬁcant decrease in KIT expression and signiﬁ-
cant increases in the expression of FAS and FH (Figs. 7A–7C),
which is in agreement with the microarray analysis results.

Network Analysis of Mushroom Responsive Genes

Genes that were regulated by mushroom extract in DU-145
tumor samples were analyzed for their functional grouping us-
ing IPA. Six networks of genes were signiﬁcantly altered by
mushroom extract identiﬁed by IPA in our data set (Table 1). Of
these networks, 2 were of prime interest to this investigation:
those grouping genes important to cell death, cellular growth
and proliferation, and cellular morphology and those group-
ing genes important to cellular growth and proliferation, lipid
metabolism, and small molecule biochemistry. An illustration
of these gene networks can be found as supplemental Data 1
and 2, respectively.

injections of DU145 cells in Matrigel (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). 6 wk after injection, mice were euthanized and A: tumor weights, B: Ki-67 antibody
staining for cell proliferation, and C: cleaved-caspase-3 antibody for apoptosis were evaluated. Data represent mean in each group (n ≥ 5 ± standard error of the
mean). * indicates statistical signiﬁcance from control group (P ≤ 0.05).

Within the gene networks, speciﬁc biological functions such
as apoptosis, lipid metabolism, and immune response were al-
tered by mushroom extract. These groupings suggest possible
mechanisms of action for the effects of mushroom extract ob-
served in the prostate tumors. Table 2 shows the gene symbol,
Entrez Gene number, fold change from controls, and description
of these gene groupings.

DISCUSSION

The aim of this research was to test the anticancer activity
of phytochemicals in the common white button mushroom
(Agaricus bisporus) in prostate cancer in vitro and in vivo.
Our results show that mushroom extract decreased the prolif-
eration of the prostate cancer cell lines in a dose-dependent
manner compared to untreated control cells. It is important to
note that mushroom extract had a similar antiproliferative effect
on all three cell lines despite their differing status with regard

to androgen responsiveness. Therefore, we can conclude that
the antiproliferative action of mushroom extract is mediated
through an androgen-independent mechanism.

As seen in Figs. 2 and 3, differing levels of sensitivity to
apoptosis induced by mushroom extract exist between the three
cell lines, with the LNCaP being the most sensitive, the PC3 less
sensitive, and the DU145 the least responsive to the proapoptotic
effects of mushroom extract. A similar result was seen in a study
utilizing an extract of Phellinus linteus (PL) mushroom in which
LNCaP cells underwent apoptosis to a larger degree than PC3
cells after treatment with PL. This study showed that caspase 2
expression was upregulated in LNCaP cells but not PC3 cells,
and inhibition of caspase 2 abolished the proapoptotic effect of
PL in LNCaP cells. The proapoptotic proteins caspase 8, caspase
3, and BID were activated equally in both LNCaP and PC3 cells
(20), suggesting that although apoptosis may be induced along
similar pathways in DU-45, PC3, and LNCaP prostate cancer
cell lines, the modulation of additional pathways in androgen

or 100 µl mushroom extract (in water). Each animal received daily gavage treatment for 7 wk. After 1 wk of gavaging, mice were given 2 subcutaneous injections
of PC3 cells in Matrigel (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). 6 wk after injection, mice were euthanized and A: tumor weights, B: Ki-67 antibody staining for cell
proliferation, and C: cleaved-caspase-3 antibody for apoptosis were evaluated. Data represent mean in each group (n ≥ 5 ± standard error of the mean). * indicates

responsive, LNCaP cells may sensitize them further and make
them more susceptible to apoptosis. Future studies will be done
to determine the mechanisms behind the differing response from
each cell line.

Our in vivo studies illustrated that oral intake of mushroom
extract suppresses the growth of androgen-independent prostate
tumors in mice. This shows that the phytochemicals present in
mushroom are active after oral ingestion. Further, the suppres-
sion of growth was due to inhibition of cell proliferation as mea-
sured by Ki-67 antibody staining, and induction of apoptosis was
observed. This result is in agreement with the in vitro results.
Our previous study (19) did not show apoptosis as a mechanism
of mushroom extract in breast cancer cells lines and tumors,
whereas in the current study in prostate cancer, apoptosis was
observed in the prostate cell lines. It is well known that distinct
cell lines within the same cancer family can respond differently
to treatment (as was seen in the current study); therefore, it is

reasonable to expect that results in two different cancer types
could also be dissimilar.

Results from microarray analysis suggest several mecha-
nisms for the effect of mushroom on prostate cancer cell prolif-
eration and apoptosis. Although the expression of many genes
was affected, two genes of primary interest are FAS/APO-1
and KIT. FAS/APO-1 is a member of the tumor necrosis fac-
tor receptor superfamily. This receptor contains a death do-
main and plays a central role in the physiological regulation of
programmed cell death (apoptosis). This gene was upregulated
2.84-fold in tumors from the mushroom group compared to pair-
fed controls (P = 0.035). KIT encodes the human homolog of
the proto-oncogene c-kit, and the protein product plays a role
in the proliferation and survival of the cell. KIT gene expres-
sion was downregulated fourfold in tumors from the mushroom
group compared to pair-fed controls (P = 0.043). These results
suggest that mushroom extract may have a favorable effect on

the proliferation and survival of prostate cancer cells in vivo
through increased expression of FAS and decreased expression
of KIT.

Microarray analysis results also indicate that the net effect of
mushroom extract on lipid metabolism in tumor tissues could
result in a decrease of diacylglycerol (DAG) and prostaglandin
E2 (PGE2) production/release while increasing ceramide and
arachidonic acid release. Both ceramide and arachidonic acid are
involved in proapoptotic signaling (21–23) in cancer cells. DAG
production leads to the activation of PKC and the subsequent in-
hibition of ceramide-mediated apoptosis (24). Therefore, mush-
room could also increase apoptosis through increased produc-
tion of arachidonic acid (an eicosanoid) and ceramide, which
is facilitated by inhibition of DAG production. Additionally, a

study by Ochoa et al. (25) found that the 9Z, 11E isomer of CLA,
which was found to be prominent in mushroom extract, had
signiﬁcant effects on cell proliferation and apoptosis through
modulation of eicosanoid biosynthesis in PC3 prostate cancer
cells. Speciﬁcally, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) protein expres-
sion and 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) mRNA expression were both
decreased in cells treated with 9Z, 11E CLA, suggesting that
modulation of eicosanoid biosynthesis may be one mechanism
by which CLA inhibits prostate cell proliferation (25). This data
is in agreement with the observed effects in the current study of
CLA-rich mushroom extract in prostate cancer cells.

Arachidonic acid is converted to PGE2 through the (COX-
2) pathway, and PGE2 production is commonly increased
in tumor tissues. PGE2 itself has been shown to promote

downregulated threefold (P = 0.017), whereas FH expression
was upregulated 4.3-fold (P = 0.009) in the mushroom-treated
group compared to pair-fed controls. This is of interest due to
the unique nature of normal prostate epithelial cells to secrete
citrate rather than utilize it in the TCA cycle for the produc-
tion of ATP. Prostate cancer cells, however, alter this balance
by upregulating the citric acid cycle to produce more energy
through increased ATP production (27). Therefore, mushroom
extract may normalize the TCA cycle in prostate cancer cells by
downregulation of isocitrate dehydrogenase expression. Citrate
is converted to acetyl co-A, which is an instrumental compo-
nent in fatty acid synthesis, leading back to the above-mentioned
effects of mushroom treatment on this process.

With regard to FH, the expression of this enzyme was upreg-
ulated in mushroom-treated mice, showing that the citric acid
cycle is not entirely inhibited; and therefore, fumarate is still
produced and in need of conversion to malate. Fumarate has
been shown to activate the angiogenic factor HIF1α, therefore
augmenting the cancer’s ability to sustain and spread through
increasing its blood supply (27). Upregulation of FH expres-
sion by mushrooms would inhibit fumarate buildup in the cell
and downregulate the angiogenic response. Additionally, en-
dothelin 1, which is a gene that is commonly upregulated in
hypoxia (28), was downregulated threefold in tumor specimens
from mushroom-treated mice. Therefore, through analysis of
the microarray data, we can further hypothesize that mush-
room decreased tumor size, tumor cell proliferation, and in-
creased tumor cell apoptosis through its effects on the TCA
cycle and fatty acid metabolism. Future studies will address this
hypothesis.

Several studies have demonstrated that several mushroom
species can enhance immunity through activation of natural
killer (NK) cells (29) and modulation of lymphocyte number and
activity (30). Studies have also shown that mushroom treatment
can induce both Type 1 and Type 2 immune response (31).
Evasion of the immune response is one way in which tumor cells
survive; therefore, the effect of mushroom on the expression of
genes important to immune function, such as was seen in the
microarray analysis (Table 2), is another mechanism that could
contribute to its anticancer action in vivo.

Identiﬁcation of the phytochemicals present in mushroom
extract is important to understanding its mode of action and
could facilitate future studies by enabling the use of puriﬁed
compounds from the extract. Similar to our previous ﬁnd-
ings in breast cancer, the current study showed that CLA in-
hibited the proliferation of prostate cancer cell lines. Much
research has been published illustrating the antiproliferative
(25,32,33) and proapoptotic (34–36) activity of CLA. CLA
has also been shown to have signiﬁcant effects on the immune
system such as increased T-cell responsiveness and splenocyte
IL-2 production in mice fed 1% CLA in the diet (37). Thus,
the presence of this compound in white button mushrooms
likely signiﬁcantly adds to the biological activity of the whole
extract.

FIG. 7. Relative expression levels of c-KIT, FAS, and FH in tumor sam-
ples. mRNA expression of A: c-Kit, B: FAS, and C: FH in tumor samples
was determined by quantitative, real-time PCR, and the expression of β-actin

cancer progression by increasing angiogenesis through vas-
cular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) activation, blocking
apoptosis through activation of the phosphatidylinositor 3-
kinase (PI3K)/AKT/peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor
(PPAR) signaling pathway, increasing tumor cell proliferation
through activation of the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK signaling path-
way and affecting immune suppression by increasing inter-
leukin 10 (IL10) production (23,26). Therefore, the suppression
of PGE2 is one way in which mushroom extract may inhibit
prostate tumor cell growth in vivo.

These effects on lipid metabolism are complimented by the
inhibition of isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (IDH2) and increased
expression of FH, 2 key tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle pro-
teins, which have also been shown to play a role in fatty
acid metabolism and tumor angiogenesis. IDH2 expression was

Taken together with research from other laboratories, our
results support the recommendation of white button mush-
room as a dietary component that may aid in the prevention
of prostate cancer in men. The in vivo studies demonstrate

that oral intake of the extract is effective in the inhibition of
prostate tumor growth in mice. Importantly, the dosage used
in the in vivo studies is considered physiologic, as the com-
mon conversion factor from murine to human dosage is 25,

calculated on body surface area (38). In addition to the in-
clusion of whole mushrooms into the diet, our work with the
extract and isolation of CLA from the extract suggests that
puriﬁed compounds or mixtures of compounds from mush-
room may have efﬁcacy as potential dietary supplements. Fu-
ture study into the mechanisms of action of mushroom extract
will help us to further delineate possible roles of mushroom
phytochemicals in the prevention and treatment of prostate
cancer.

Abstract

Background: Several lifestyle factors targeted by the American Cancer Society (ACS) Nutrition and Physical Activity

Cancer Prevention Guidelines are also associated with circulating concentrations of vitamin D metabolites. This suggests

that greater adherence to the ACS guidelines may be related to better vitamin D status.

Objective: We examined the relation between adherence to the ACS guidelines and circulating concentrations of
2 vitamin D metabolites, 25-hydroxycholecalciferol [25(OH)D] and 1a,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25(OH)2D].
Methods: We conducted cross-sectional analyses of pooled participants from the Wheat Bran Fiber (n = 503) and
Ursodeoxycholic Acid (n = 854) trials. A cumulative adherence score was constructed with the use of baseline data on

body size, diet, physical activity, and alcohol consumption. Continuous vitamin D metabolite concentrations and clinically

relevant categories were evaluated with the use of multiple linear and logistic regression models, respectively.

Results: The most adherent participants were more likely to be older, white, and nonsmokers than were the least adherent. A
statistically signiﬁcant association was observed between guideline adherence and concentrations of circulating 25(OH)D (means 6
SEs—high adherence: 32.0 6 0.8 ng/mL; low adherence: 26.4 6 0.7 ng/mL; P-trend < 0.001). For 1,25(OH)2D concentrations, high
adherence was again signiﬁcantly related to greater metabolite concentrations, with mean 6 SE concentrations of 36.3 6 1.3 pg/mL
and 31.9 6 1.0 pg/mL for high- and low-adherers, respectively (P-trend = 0.008). Furthermore, the odds of attaining a sufﬁcient

25(OH)D status were 4.37 times higher for those most adherent than for those least adherent (95% CI: 2.47, 7.71 times).

Conclusion: These ﬁndings demonstrate that greater adherence to the ACS guidelines is associated with higher
circulating concentrations of both of 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)2D. J Nutr 2017;147:421–9.

deﬁciency (1–7). Vitamin D deﬁciency has been linked
to several major causes of death,
including cardiovas-
cular disease, diabetes, and cancer (8). Although the de-
ﬁnition of clinical vitamin D deﬁciency has been updated
(9, 10),
the
optimal amount of vitamin D intake required to meet
deﬁnitions of vitamin D sufﬁciency also remains unclear
(12–14). Vitamin D supplementation with cholecalcif-
erol (vitamin D3) is the primary clinical strategy used to
increase circulating concentrations of 25-hydroxycholecalciferol

it remains debated (8, 11). Furthermore,

[25(OH)D]9, the metabolite most often measured to determine
vitamin D status in adults (15). However, studies of vitamin D
supplementation and health outcomes have produced equivocal
results (16, 17). In addition, there are emerging data that genetic
background may inﬂuence response to vitamin D supplementa-
tion (18, 19). Humans can also produce 25(OH)D via exposure
to UVB radiation (20), but this route is rarely promoted, because
excessive sunlight exposure can cause sunburns and increase the
risk of skin cancer (8). With regard to diet, naturally occurring
vitamin D is found in only a limited number of foods, such as
fatty ﬁsh, whereas vitamin D–fortiﬁed foods such as dairy
products, ready-to-eat cereals, and orange juice are more
common. Therefore, the optimal strategy for improving vitamin
D status remains equivocal.

Several lifestyle factors targeted by the American Cancer
Society (ACS) Nutrition and Physical Activity Cancer Prevention
Guidelines, including body size, diet, and physical activity, have
also been associated with circulating concentrations of vitamin
D (12, 21, 22). Our group recently completed a systematic
review that found strong and consistent evidence indicating that
adherence to the ACS or similar World Cancer Research
Fund/American Institute for Cancer Research guidelines was
associated with signiﬁcant reductions in cancer incidence and
mortality (23). One study included in the review by Kabat et al.
(24) reported a statistically signiﬁcant association between
higher adherence to the guidelines and increased melanoma
incidence. One explanation for these ﬁndings is that adherence
to the guidelines, particularly for physical activity, is related to
increased sun exposure and potentially higher vitamin D
concentrations. Thus, we hypothesized that greater adherence
to the guidelines would be associated with higher concentrations
of vitamin D metabolites. We used data from a pooled sample of
2 completed chemoprevention trials to construct an adherence
score for the ACS nutrition and physical activity cancer
prevention guidelines and assess the relation between adher-
ence and concentrations of 25(OH)D (n = 1357) and 1a,25-
dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25(OH)2D] (n = 854).

Methods

Study population. Data were pooled from 2 randomized, controlled,
double-blind, Phase III clinical trials conducted at the University of
Arizona Cancer Center from 1990 to 1999. These studies evaluated the
effect of either a wheat bran ﬁber (WBF) supplement (25, 26) or
ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) (27) on the development of a new
colorectal adenoma in patients with previously removed colorectal
adenomas. The present analyses were conducted with the use of data for
baseline diet, physical activity, and vitamin D biomarkers from the
pooled population. The University of Arizona Human Subjects Protec-
tion Program approved both studies. Written informed consent was
obtained from each participant before trial enrollment.

Recruitment and data collection. Phoenix and Tucson gastroenterol-
ogy practices served as recruitment centers from 1990 to 1995 for the
WBF supplement and 1995 to 1999 for the UDCA. Men (69.5%) and
women (30.5%) with a mean age of 65.5 y (range: 40–80 y) who had
$1 adenomas measuring $3 mm removed during a colonoscopy within a
6-mo period before study registration were included in the study. Mean 6
SD BMI (in kg/m2) was 28.3 6 4.2 and 27.7 6 5.5 for men and
women, respectively. Participants in the WBF supplement trial were
randomly assigned to a daily WBF supplement (13.5 g/d) or a low-ﬁber

supplement (2.0 g/d) (25). Participants in the UDCA trial were randomly
assigned to receive 8–10 mg UDCA/kg body weight or placebo daily (27).
Primary ﬁndings from the trials were null; neither the WBF supplement
nor the UDCA treatment prevented new colorectal adenomas (26, 27).
For the present cross-sectional analysis, participants from the pooled
sample (n = 3221) were excluded if they did not have serum 25(OH)D
data (n = 1253), had missing BMI data (n = 16), were underweight (BMI
<18.5) (n = 16), had unreliable dietary data (<600 kcal/d) (n = 14), had
missing baseline physical activity data (n = 544), or were missing any
other covariate included in the models (race, n = 16; education, n = 5).
The analytic cohort for 25(OH)D was thus composed of 1357 partici-
pants, whereas 1,25(OH)2D data were only available from the UDCA
trial (n = 854).

Analysis of serum vitamin D metabolites. Baseline vitamin D
metabolites were measured in a blinded fashion at Heartland Assays
(Ames) with the use of an established RIA (28). Quality-assurance and
-control measures, including pooled serum samples and duplicates in
different batches, were performed. The CV was <7.0% for 25(OH)D and
11.5% for 1,25(OH)2D. Serum 1,25(OH)2D was assessed as a contin-
uous variable and 25(OH)D was assessed as both a continuous and a
categorical variable,
in which clinically important categories were
deﬁned as deﬁcient (<20 ng/mL), insufﬁcient ($20 to <30 ng/mL), or
sufﬁcient ($30 ng/mL) (9, 10, 29–31).

Nutrition and physical activity cancer prevention guidelines
score. An a priori score was constructed based upon previously
published work by Thomson et al. (32) for adherence to the 2012 ACS
cancer prevention guidelines for nutrition and physical activity (33)
(Table 1). These guidelines focused on overall patterns of lifestyle
behaviors that included body size, physical activity, diet, and alcohol
consumption. Baseline diet and physical activity were collected with the
use of frequency questionnaires. The Arizona FFQ is a semiquantitative
175-item validated questionnaire that asks respondents to report how
often (per day, week, or month) and how much (small, medium, or large
usual portion) participants consumed each food item over the previous
12-mo period (34). The Arizona Activity Frequency Questionnaire is a
59-item validated questionnaire that groups physical activity by leisure,
recreational, household, and other activity categories (35). The provided
output contains metabolic equivalent task (MET) units per day and per
activity, kilojoules, number of hours per day per activity, and number of
activities reported by respondents for each category, which were used to
generate the physical activity score. Each ACS recommendation was
equally weighted 0–2 points. Zero points were allocated for not meeting
the recommendation at all, 1 point for partially meeting the recommen-
dation, and 2 points for fully meeting the recommendation. The overall
score, summed from individual recommendations, ranged from 0 for
those participants who were not adherent at all to the recommendations
to 8 for those participants who were fully adherent to all 4 lifestyle factor
recommendations. Adherence categories were deﬁned as low (0–2
points), moderate (3–5 points), and high (6–8 points). The recommen-
dations for each lifestyle factor, how they were measured, how scores
were assigned based upon the guidelines, and the proportion of the study
population within each category are outlined in Table 1. Smoking status
was not included in the ACS adherence scoring, but was included as a
potential confounder in the current analyses.

The ﬁrst recommendation to ‘‘maintain a healthy weight throughout
life’’ was scored based upon calculated BMI from height and weight
reported at baseline. The best score (2 points) was given to those with a
BMI within normal range (18.5–25), 1 point was given those in the
overweight range (25–30), and 0 points were given to those in the obese
category (>30.0). Underweight participants (<18.5) were excluded from
the present analysis.

The second recommendation to ‘‘adopt a physically active lifestyle’’
was evaluated by MET (36) scores from the Arizona FFQ recreational
activities section. Any participant doing less than the minimum
recommendation [30 min on 5 d (2.5 h/wk) of moderate activity (3.5
METs) was equal to 8.75 MET-h/wk] received a score of 0 points. One
hour per day, 5 d/wk (5.0 h/wk), of moderate activity (3.5 METs)
equaled 17.5 MET-h/wk. Therefore, 8.75–17.5 MET-h/wk earned a

score of 1 point. Participants meeting preferable levels, >17.5 MET-
h/wk, earned a score of 2 points.

The third recommendation to ‘‘consume a healthy diet with an
emphasis on plant sources’’ was assessed with 3 separate diet scores that
were constructed and summed to capture the recommended dietary
pattern. The ﬁrst diet score for the recommendation ‘‘eat 5 or more
servings of a variety of vegetables and fruits each day’’ was assigned
1 point for meeting the recommended number of servings ($2.5
cups), which were measured from the food group categories fruits,
fruit juice, vegetables, and vegetable juice. An additional 1 or 2
points were assigned for diet quality based upon being in the second
or third sex-speciﬁc tertile of total carotenoids, respectively, which
included b-carotene, a-carotene, b-cryptoxanthin, lycopene, and lutein
plus zeaxanthin combined. The second diet score for the recommendation
‘‘choose whole grains in preference to processed (reﬁned) grains’’ was
evaluated by the percentage of grains consumed as whole grains. Points
were assigned by the sex-speciﬁc quartile distribution with the highest
quartile receiving 3 points and lowest quartile receiving 0 points. The third
diet score for the recommendation ‘‘limit consumption of processed
and red meats’’ was measured similarly to the whole grains assessed
by sex-speciﬁc quartile distribution. However, the lowest quartile
received 3 points and the highest quartile received 0 points. The 3 diet

scores were summed for a potential total of 9 points. Dietary pattern
scores were further collapsed into 0 points (0–2 summed diet scores),
1 point (3–6 summed diet scores), and 2 points (7–9 summed diet scores).
The fourth recommendation used in this analysis was ‘‘if you drink
alcohol, limit consumption to 1 drink/d for women or 2 drinks/d for
men.’’ Alcohol was captured in the Arizona FFQ in terms of total grams
of alcohol per day. One drink was estimated as 14 g alcohol or
approximately one 12-ounce regular beer, 5-ounce glass of wine, or 1.5-
ounce shot of 80-proof distilled spirit (37). Nondrinkers were assigned 2
points, moderate drinkers who consumed the limit or less were assigned
1 point, and heavy drinkers who consumed more than the limit were
assigned 0 points.

Statistical analysis. Descriptive statistics were generated for vitamin D
metabolites, adherence scores, and demographic variables. Means and
SEs were estimated for continuous variables and percentages were
calculated for the categorical variables.

Multiple linear regression models were used to assess the relations
between adherence score categories and circulating concentrations of 25
(OH)D and 1,25(OH)2D. Estimated mean concentrations of 25(OH)D
and 1,25(OH)2D for individuals in the reference categories were
centered on mean age and energy intake of the strata with the use of

linear combinations of variables. Reference categories were selected to
represent the majority of the pooled sample (white, male, not a college
graduate, and nonsmoker in the UDCA trial). Associations between
adherence scores and clinically signiﬁcant categories for serum 25(OH)D
were evaluated with the use of multinomial logistic regression models
to estimate ORs. Individual adherence score components were also
examined for associations with adjusted mean concentrations of 25
(OH)D and 1,25(OH)2D. Regression modeling was also used to
calculate P-trend. Potential confounders included age, education, race,
smoking status, supplement use, season of blood draw, and energy
intake (21, 22, 38–40). A covariate was considered to be a confounder if
it changed the measure of association by $10% when included in a
regression model (41). To assess whether the associations between
adherence score and vitamin D metabolites were modiﬁed by sex or
study, likelihood ratio tests were used to determine whether there was a
difference in the log-likelihoods from models with and without interac-
tion terms. Statistical signiﬁcance was determined at an a level of 0.05.
Data from the trials were merged and managed with the use of Stata
version 14.1.

Results

More women than men met the BMI recommendation of a
healthy body size (18.5–25), whereas more men than women
met preferable physical activity levels of >1 h/d, 5 d/wk (>5.0
h/wk) of moderate activity (3.5 METs), or >17.5 MET-h/wk
total (Table 1). Men and women had similar adherence to diet
recommendations overall; however, a greater percentage of
women were nondrinkers at baseline than men. Baseline
characteristics of men and women by category of adherence

score are shown in Table 2. In general, participants in the most
adherent overall category of adherence score (6–8 points) were
more likely to be older, white, and nonsmokers than were
participants in the least adherent category (0–2 points).

Adjusted mean circulating 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)2D con-
centrations for each adherence score category from multivariate
linear regression models for individuals in reference categories
(white, male, not a college graduate, nonsmoker in the UDCA
trial) centered on mean age and energy intake are shown in Table
3. In the pooled sample, those in the highest adherence category
to the ACS guidelines (6–8 points) had a mean 6 SE 25(OH)D
concentration of 32.0 6 0.8 ng/mL and a mean 6 SE 1,25
(OH)2D concentration of 36.3 6 1.3 pg/mL, with signiﬁcant
dose-dependent trends for both metabolites (P-trend < 0.001
and P-trend < 0.008, respectively) (Table 3). For 25(OH)D,
there were no statistically signiﬁcant
interactions for sex
(P-interaction = 0.42) or study (P-interaction = 0.19). Study
interaction was not evaluated for 1,25(OH)2D, because it was
only available for the UDCA study. There was no statistically
signiﬁcant interaction between score and sex (P-interaction = 0.86)
for 1,25(OH)2D.

The results of multinomial logistic regression models for
the association between categories of adherence scores and
clinically-deﬁned categories of 25(OH)D are presented in Table
4. The odds of having an insufﬁcient vitamin D status
($20 ng/mL and <30 ng/mL) compared with a deﬁcient status
(<20 ng/mL) were 1.76 times greater (95% CI: 1.21, 2.57) for
those who had moderate adherence to the guidelines and 2.29
times greater (95% CI: 1.35, 3.90) for individuals who had high

adherence compared with those with low adherence. The odds
of having a sufﬁcient vitamin D status ($30 ng/mL) compared
with a deﬁcient status were 2.41 times greater (95% CI: 1.58,
3.68) for those achieving moderate adherence and 4.37 times
greater (95% CI: 2.47, 7.71) for those who had high adherence
compared with those within the lowest adherence category.

Adjusted mean concentrations of 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)2D
for individuals in the reference categories (white male, not a
college graduate, and a nonsmoker in the UDCA trial) by
adherence score components are displayed in Table 5. An inverse
relation between BMI categories and both 25(OH)D and 1,25
(OH)2D exhibited a dose-dependent trend (both comparisons,
P-trend < 0.001). Similarly, a signiﬁcant trend was seen for
higher levels of physical activity and higher concentrations of
both vitamin D metabolites (P-trend < 0.001). In contrast, any
association or trend between diet component and either vitamin
D metabolite was less clear. A diet score of 1 point was
signiﬁcantly associated with 25(OH)D with a signiﬁcant overall
trend (P-trend = 0.039). No signiﬁcant association was observed
between diet score and 1,25(OH)2D. A signiﬁcant trend was
seen for increasing alcohol consumption and increasing concen-
trations of both 25(OH)D (P-trend = 0.009) and 1,25(OH)2D
(P-trend = 0.040).

Discussion

Greater adherence to nutrition and physical activity cancer
prevention guidelines that have been developed by the ACS and
other leading cancer organizations has been found to be
associated with a reduced risk of overall cancer incidence and
mortality,
including some site-speciﬁc cancers (23). These
guidelines are consistent with recommendations for the pre-
vention of other major diseases as well, and, if followed,

are associated with healthier lives overall (42–44). To our
knowledge, no studies have assessed the relation between ACS
guidelines for cancer prevention and circulating concentrations of
vitamin D metabolites, which are biomarkers often linked
to health outcomes (45). This current work offers evidence
indicating that greater adherence to an overall lifestyle pattern as
outlined by the ACS nutrition and physical activity cancer
prevention guidelines is associated with higher concentrations of
both 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)2D, based on a pooled sample of
participants enrolled in one of 2 chemoprevention trials in
Arizona. Furthermore, signiﬁcant dose-dependent trends were
seen for BMI, physical activity, and alcohol intake and both
vitamin D metabolites. The lack of signiﬁcant association between
diet adherence scores and vitamin D was not unexpected, because
the fruit, vegetable, grain, and red and processed meat variables
included in the diet adherence score are not considered to be
substantial dietary sources of vitamin D. The relation between
alcohol intake and higher circulating concentrations of vitamin D
has been reported previously, with suggestions of residual
confounding or heavier consumers of alcohol having lifestyles
favorable to higher concentrations of circulating vitamin D (46,
47). To our knowledge, there is no clear biological mechanism,
and this warrants further investigation.

Concentrations of 25(OH)D can vary from many nonmodiﬁ-
able factors, such as skin pigmentation, sex, genetic background, and
season (30, 40). However, 25(OH)D also varies from modiﬁable
factors, such as amount of sun exposure, dietary intake, and
supplementation (20). Sun exposure increases vitamin D production,
but also can cause skin damage or even skin cancer, the risk of which
varies according to skin pigmentation and possibly body size (48,
49). Compared with normal-weight adults, obese adults have been
found to have signiﬁcantly lower concentrations of the vitamin D
metabolite 25(OH)D, possibly because of lower dietary intake or

lesser exposure of skin to sunlight, volumetric dilution, or seques-
tration in adipose tissue (49–51). Healthy-weight adults with
higher levels of physical activity are more likely to meet DRIs for
vitamin D and other micronutrients than are overweight adults
(52). Furthermore, several studies have suggested that obese
adults may need higher doses of supplementation than
normal do weight adults to achieve sufﬁcient 25(OH)D
status (12, 53).

A recent review of vitamin D supplementation trials estimates
that 2990 IU/d is required to surpass deﬁcient concentrations
(20 ng/mL) of serum 25(OH)D in 97.5% of healthy individuals
(13). The RDA for healthy adults aged 19–70 y is 600 IU, and it
is 800 IU for those >70 y of age (1). However, it has been
suggested that these recommendations have been miscalculated,
are too low, and should be reconsidered (14). The means and
SDs of 25(OH)D for selected large vitamin-D supplementation
trials (54–60) presented in the review by Veugelers et al. (13), as
well as a trial conducted by our group (57), are presented in
Table 6. Three studies used dosages of 400 IU/d with follow-up
times of 4, 48, and 108 wk, resulting in mean 6 SD 25(OH)D
concentrations of 28.3 6 8.9 ng/mL in healthy men and women
(57), and 36.9 6 9.5 ng/mL (56) and 24.4 6 12.2 ng/mL (60) in
2 separate studies of postmenopausal women. Dosages of 800
IU/d were used in 2 trials with a range of follow-up times from
13 to 156 wk, resulting in mean 6 SD 25(OH)D concentrations
of 28.39 6 9.18 ng/mL and 29.91 6 8.78 ng/mL in women (54,
58). In a study that evaluated the effect of a daily dose of 1000 IU
in preventing new colorectal adenomas, healthy non-Hispanic
white subjects aged 45–75 y had mean 6 SD concentrations of
31.5 6 8.9 ng/mL after 1 y (55). Comparably in our study,
moderate and high adherence to the ACS guidelines demon-
strated mean 6 SD concentrations of 25(OH)D of 29.6 6
0.5 ng/mL and 32.0 6 0.8 ng/mL, respectively. Therefore,
following the ACS guidelines could potentially increase 25(OH)
D concentrations as much as or more than a supplement of 1000 IU/d.
Improving vitamin D status through lifestyle modiﬁcations as
opposed to supplementation allows for a strategy that would
avoid any potential toxicity, such as renal calciﬁcations (16), and
is likely to incur other health beneﬁts as well.

Less is known about lifestyle factors that may be associated
with circulating concentrations of 1,25(OH)2D (61). Few epi-
demiologic studies have evaluated the association between
1,25(OH)2D and physical activity. One examined the effects of
long-term aerobic exercise and v-3 supplementation on bone
health in postmenopausal women and found that 1,25(OH)2D
increased with the intervention (62). Similarly, in a study within
the UDCA cohort included in the present study, moderate to
vigorous physical activity was positively associated with 1,25
(OH)2D, with women experiencing the greatest increase (21).
Hibler et al. (21) suggested that the association between physical
activity and vitamin D may be beyond sun exposure and driven

by the role of 1,25(OH)2D in bone health. It is also possible that
increased physical activity exerts an effect on metabolism that
itself results in higher production of vitamin D metabolites;
however, any biological mechanism would be speculative at this
time. BMI, the measure used to estimate body size in our study,
has a well-known inverse relation with 25(OH)D, but evidence
of its relation with 1,25(OH)2D is limited. A statistically
signiﬁcant association between higher circulating concentrations
of 1,25(OH)2D and a lower risk of metabolic syndrome, which
consists of waist circumference, TGs, blood pressure, glucose,
and HDL cholesterol, was also reported in a sample population
from the UDCA and WBF supplement cohorts (63).

In addition,

The major strengths of

the current study include the
availability of data from a prospective cohort of >1300
participants with complete data on a wide range of available
baseline nutrition, physical activity, and serum vitamin D
metabolite data. However, even though the original trials were
prospective cohorts,
this secondary data analysis is cross-
sectional in nature, with measurements coming from baseline
assessments. Furthermore, only one measure of 25(OH)D was
used for the assessment of vitamin D status, although previous
ﬁndings suggest that single baseline 25(OH)D measurements
provide reasonably representative measures of the biomarker
(64).
the ‘‘maintenance of a healthy weight
throughout life’’ ACS guideline could not be precisely assessed
because height and weight data were not available for earlier
periods in life. Although the instruments used to collect lifestyle
data asked for usual dietary consumption in the previous 12-mo
period and the last 4 wk for physical activity, the reported
behaviors may not be representative of the participantsÕ longer-
term behaviors. Participants in this study had already had a
colorectal adenoma removed, and may have changed their
lifestyle habits after removal of their adenoma, which had to
have occurred within the previous 6 mo before study enrollment,
thus affecting the generalizability of the results. Although self-
reports of physical activity and dietary and alcohol intake are
susceptible to measurement error or misclassiﬁcation bias, the
frequency questionnaires used had been validated in the study
sample. There is also the potential issue that the various healthy
behaviors included in the ACS adherence score may cluster in
individuals, making it difﬁcult to separate the effect of the score
components. Finally, circulating concentrations of vitamin D
metabolites may merely be a biomarker of risk, or, in this case,
an overall lifestyle pattern, and not necessarily a mechanism of
action for disease risk (40). Nonetheless, these ﬁndings indicate
the potential for increasing concentrations of vitamin D when
the overall guidelines are more closely followed.

In summary, there remains a great deal of debate regarding
vitamin D status and the strategy for best achieving sufﬁcient
concentrations, including the use and dosing of supplements.
Our results suggest that following an overall pattern of healthy
behaviors as recommended in the ACS Nutrition and Physical
Activity Cancer Prevention guidelines may be associated with
higher concentrations of both 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)2D. In
addition, score components also demonstrated signiﬁcant asso-
ciations. Therefore, close adherence to the ACS nutrition and
physical activity cancer prevention guidelines may be a viable
public health strategy for increasing both 25(OH)D and 1,25
(OH)2D concentrations.

in combination with the GSTM1 genotype or the NAT2 imputed phenotype. A total of 952 rectal cancer cases and
1205 controls (between September 1997 and February 2002) and 1346 colon cancer cases and 1544 controls
(between October 1991 and September 1994) from Utah and Northern California were recruited from a population-
based case-control study. Detailed interviews ascertained lifestyle, medical history, and diet and we extracted DNA
from whole blood. Risk of colorectal cancer decreased among men with the CYP1A1 *2 any variant genotype and
the lowest intake of poultry and men and women with high use of white meat drippings. Risk increased among men
with the CYP1A1 *1 (no variant) allele and high white meat mutagen index, but decreased among those with the
CYP1A1 *2 genotype. Risk increased with a high white meat mutagen index among women with the CYP1A1 *2
genotype and the GSTM1 present genotype. Risk of colorectal cancer decreased with the CYP1A1 *2 genotype,
the NAT2 slow phenotype, and the use of white meat or its drippings. The association of risk for colorectal cancer
and selected red and white meat mutagen indices and the use of white meat drippings, or fried white meat variables
was more evident within select combinations of the CYP1A1 genotype and either the GSTM1 genotype or NAT2
than with the CYP1A1 alone. Genetic susceptibility may modify the associations of some meat or meat preparation
factors with the risk of colorectal cancer.

Heterocyclic amines (HCAs)3 are formed as a by-product of
reactions during the cooking of meat, especially when it is
well-done, char-broiled, or pan-fried (1–5). Dietary exposure
to HCAs has been a suspected risk factor for colorectal cancer
since the 1970s (6). Food is one of the primary sources of
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) exposure in the
United States, and grilled or barbecued meats contribute much
of the carcinogenic PAH in the diet (7). Inherited variation in
the metabolism of HCA and PAH compounds appears to be
responsible for between-individual variation in systemic expo-
sure and may modify cancer risk associated with these expo-
sures. Metabolism of certain PAH compounds to mutagenic

(8,9). However, other CYP enzymes,

forms is initiated by a cytochrome p-4501A1 (CYP1A1)-
catalyzed hydroxylation. Reactive intermediates can be detox-
iﬁed by the glutathione S-transferase M1 (GSTM1) enzyme.
We hypothesized that variants that increase CYP1A1 activity,
and the GSTM1 null variant, associated with no enzymatic
activity, are also associated with increased risk of cancers.
Initial N-hydroxylation of HCA compounds in liver is primar-
ily catalyzed by CYP1A2; to date, no known CYP1A2 genetic
variants explain the interindividual variation in CYP1A2 ac-
tivity
including
CYP1A1, are capable of some metabolism of HCA and are
expressed in extrahepatic tissues (10). Further, CYP1A en-
zymes are coordinately regulated and a CYP1A1 polymor-
phism may be correlated with a difference in CYP1A2 activity
(11). The N-acetyl transferase (NAT) enzymes catalyze the
next step of activation of HCAs, O-acetylation, to form com-
pounds that covalently bind to DNA. Therefore, we hypoth-
esized that CYP1A1 and the inherited low-activity NAT2
variants may be associated with decreased risk of colorectal
cancer (12).

We used genotype information from large, population-
based case-control studies of cancers of the colon (13) and
rectum (14) for our previous reports that a high index for
mutagen exposure from meat in diet was associated with an

increased risk of colon (15) and rectal cancer (16) in men. In
men, consumption of well-done meat was associated with an
increased risk for rectal cancer (16). There was no association
between mutagen index and colon or rectal cancer for women
(15,16). We found that the risk of colon cancer was not
associated with the NAT2 phenotype or the GSTM1 genotype
alone, but was modestly increased among those men with the
NAT2 intermediate or rapid type acetylator phenotype and
high processed meat consumption or high mutagen index
(15). Use of red meat drippings by women was associated
with a decreased risk of rectal cancer, and this decrease was
greater among women with the slow NAT2-imputed phe-
notype and the GSTM1 absent genotype (16). We previ-
ously reported that genotypes of phase II metabolizing en-
zymes
interacted with associations of meat and meat
preparation variables differentially by gender with risk for
colon (15) and rectal cancer (16).

Studies considering combinations of phase I and phase II
metabolizing enzymes might be necessary to determine sub-
stantial increases in risk (8,17,18). However, the variants in
the human CYP1A1 gene are infrequent in Caucasian popu-
lations, so studies of association with cancer have had little
power to detect an association (19 –22). In the present report,
we investigated whether polymorphisms in CYP1A1, indepen-
dently and in combination with GSTM1 genotype or NAT2
imputed phenotype, modify the association of meat consump-
tion and/or preparation with risk of colorectal cancer in men
and women from Utah and northern California. Speciﬁcally
we hypothesized that CYP1A1 variants increasing activity
would be independently associated with increased risk of colo-
rectal cancer. We hypothesized that those with the activity
increasing variants in CYP1A1 and GSTM1 null genotype
would be at increased risk of colorectal cancer and that those
with the fast/intermediate NAT2 imputed phenotype would be
at increased risk of colorectal cancer.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Participants. Cases with a ﬁrst primary tumor in the rectosig-
moid junction or rectum were identiﬁed between May 1997 and May
2001 using a rapid-reporting system (14). Cases with ﬁrst primary
colon cancer were identiﬁed between October 1991 and September
1994 (13). Case eligibility was determined in northern California by
the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results Cancer Registries and
in Utah using a rapid-reporting system. An on-line pathology report-
ing system was searched for rapid case ascertainment of rectal cancer
cases at Kaiser Permanente Northern California Cancer Registry
(KPMCP). Cases identiﬁed were conﬁrmed through linkage to the
KPMCP. Cases with a previous colorectal tumor were not eligible for
the study. Cases with known (as indicated on the pathology report)
familial adenomatous polyposis, ulcerative colitis, or Crohn’s disease
were not eligible. In addition to these criteria, participants were
between 30 and 79 y of age at the time of diagnosis, English speaking,
and mentally competent to complete the interview.

Controls were matched to cases by sex and by 5-year age groups.
At the KPMCP, controls were randomly selected from membership
lists, and in Utah controls 65 y and older were randomly selected from
social security lists and controls younger than 65 were randomly
selected from driver’s license lists. A total of 952 rectal cancer cases
and 1205 matched controls and 1346 colon cancer cases and 1544
matched controls are included in the analyses presented. Response
rates for the rectal study were 65.2% for cases and 65.3% for controls;
cooperation rates, or the number of people who participated from
those who we were able to contact, were 73.2% for cases and 68.8%
for controls. For the colon cancer study response rates were 71.8% for
cases and 68.0% for controls.

Data collection. Data were collected by trained and certiﬁed
interviewers using laptop computers. The interview took approxi-
mately 2 h. Quality control methods used in the rectal cancer study

Diet. We obtained dietary intake using an adaptation of the
Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults diet history
(24 –26). Participants were asked to recall foods eaten for the calen-
dar year occurring 2 y before their cancer diagnosis (cases) or recruit-
ment into the study (controls), the frequency that they were eaten,
serving size, and whether fats were added in the preparation. Food
intake data were converted to nutrient data using the Minnesota
Nutrition Coordinating Center nutrient database Version 4.02_30.
Additional information was gathered on usual doneness of red meats
(rare, medium rare, medium well done, and well done). Participants
were asked how frequently they fried, broiled, baked, or barbequed
(cooked at high temperatures) and how frequently drippings were
used in other foods or gravies. Variables included servings of partic-
ular foods or food groups (i.e., red meat, poultry, red meat drippings)
consumed per day, week, or year. The mutagen index was calculated
as the frequency of red meat, poultry, and ﬁsh consumption prepared
by frying, broiling, baking, or barbecuing plus the use of drippings
from red meat, poultry, or ﬁsh, multiplied by the usual doneness of red
meat, poultry, and ﬁsh (1 ⫽ rare, 2 ⫽ medium rare, 3 ⫽ medium well,
and 4 ⫽ well done) and the microwave factor (1 ⫽ microwave never
used or used for thawing, 0.75 ⫽ sometimes used, 0.50 ⫽ often used,
0.25 ⫽ always used) (15). A higher index reﬂects higher intake of
potentially mutagenic compounds.

Genetic data. DNA was extracted from whole blood. The
CYP1A1 thymine (T) ⬎ cytosine (C) (*2A allele) transition in the
3⬘-untranslated region was detected using the PCR method described
by Hayashi et al. (27), in which the 343 basepair (bp) PCR product
was digested with MspI. The common allele (T) is uncut and is ⬃340
bp in length. The C allele is digested and leads to 2 smaller bands of
200 and 140 bp. The CYP1A1 A4889G (Ile462Val, *2B allele) was
detected using allele-speciﬁc PCR and was performed with one up-
stream primer and 2 downstream primers as described by Rebbeck et
al. (28) with the following modiﬁcations. The downstream primer
speciﬁc for the uncommon allele guanine (G) was modiﬁed with a
GC clamp to increase the melting temperature (CGCCCGCCGC-
CGCCCGCCGCGTGTATCGGTGAGACCG); the downstream
primer speciﬁc for the common allele adenine (A) is the same as in
Rebbeck et al. (28) (GAAGTGTATCGGTGAGACCA). The
common upstream primer used was (TTCCACCCGTTGCAG-
CAGGATAGCC) (29). PCR was performed and analyzed using the
iCycler iQ real-time detection system. PCR conditions were 35 cycles
of 15 s each at 95, 61, and 72°C. This was followed by 10 s at 95°C
and then by 80 cycles of half degree decrements for 10 s for analysis
of melting temperature. The melting temperature of the common
allele was 85.5°C, whereas the melting temperature of the uncommon
(G) allele, due to the GC clamp, was 90.5°C. This assay utilizes Sybr
green dye and the 2.3 version of the software. Any genotype with a
G allele was veriﬁed by PCR ampliﬁcation with the following primers:
CTGTCTCCCTCTGGTTACAGGAAG (29) and GGCACGC
TGAATTCCAC GCAATGCAGC AGGATAGC, which was
then followed by BsrDI restriction digestion. PCR conditions for this
reaction were the same as for the above iCycler reaction except that
30 cycles were performed. The uncut product is 215 bp in length. The
G allele leads to loss of the restriction site and a 192-bp band due to
digestion of the control BsrDI site. Amplicons with the A allele are
further digested to 149/43 bp.

The GSTM1 null genotype was detected using the PCR method
described by Zhong et al. (30). To determine acetylator status we
assessed the presence of the *5, *6, or *7 alleles of NAT2, using the
method of Bell et al. (31). These 3 variants account for ⬃90 to 95%
of the slow acetylation phenotype in Caucasians. All 3 variants could
be identiﬁed from 1 PCR product that is digested with 3 different
restriction enzymes. The C481T variant (*5 allele) was determined
using a KpnI digest; the G590A variant (*6 allele) using a TaqI digest;
and the G857A variant (*7 allele) using a Bam HI digest. Because
genotype, not phenotype, is measured, we deﬁne imputed phenotype
as follows: those carrying two *5, *6, or *7 variant alleles were
classiﬁed as slow acetylators; those with 1 or 0 of these alleles were
classiﬁed as rapid/intermediate acetylators. Detailed descriptions of
the methods have been previously reported (15,16,32).

Height and weight were measured at the time of interview. The
BMI (kg/m2) was calculated for men and women. Weight was also
reported for the 2 and 5 y prior to interview. Physical activity data
were collected using a physical activity questionnaire that has been
described elsewhere (33). All procedures were approved by the Uni-
versity of Utah Institution Review Board.

Statistical methods. Descriptive statistics of continuous variables
are presented as means ⫾ SD with comparisons made by Students t
test. Descriptive statistics for categorical variables are presented as
percentages and comparisons are made using chi-square tests. Differ-
ences were considered signiﬁcant at P ⬍ 0.05. Unconditional logistic
regression models were used to estimate risk (odds ratios, 95% CI) of
colon and rectal cancer and dietary meat consumption and meat
preparation methods. Associations were explored in men and women
separately based on previous gender-speciﬁc ﬁndings (15,16). Asso-
ciations with the mutagen index were similar for colon and rectal
cancer; therefore, to increase power we pooled colon and rectal
cancer cases by gender for further analysis.

We assessed dietary data by determining risk across medians,
thirds, or quartiles of intake or cutoffs used for previous papers (15)
depending on the distribution of the data. The medians, thirds, or
quartiles were determined by the sex-speciﬁc intake distribution in
the control population. In these models the following variables were
included: age at selection, BMI, physical activity, energy intake,
dietary ﬁber, dietary calcium, and cigarette smoking status. To eval-
uate the potential inﬂuence of ethnicity on results, analyses were
repeated in Caucasians only. Odds ratios and interpretation of the
data were not substantially different, although statistical signiﬁcance
(P ⬍ 0.05) and CI were inﬂuenced by the smaller cell sizes. Results

are reported for all race/ethnicities without race/ethnicity as a covari-
ate.

Linear trend was determined by evaluating the signiﬁcance of
linear association across the categorized variable. We assessed the
CYP1A1 as no variant (*1 neither variant) or any *2 variant (het-
erozygous/variant) of the MspI or Ill462Val polymorphisms. The
GSTM1 was assessed as present or absent and the NAT2 was analyzed
as slow or rapid/intermediate imputed phenotype. Interaction, or
effect modiﬁcation, between meat-related variables and the CYP1A1
alone and with the GSTM1 or NAT2 genotype was evaluated as the
excess risk on both additive (34) and multiplicative scales with trend
variables.

RESULTS

Participants in the colon cancer study were between 64 and
65 y of age, whereas participants in the rectal cancer study
were between 61 and 62 y of age. The majority of participants
were non-Hispanic white (Table 1). Men and women with
colon cancer consumed more fat and a higher percentage of
energy from fat than their gender-matched controls. Men and
women with colon and rectal cancer consumed more choles-
terol than controls. Men with rectal cancer consumed more
animal protein than male controls. Men with colon or rectal
cancer and women with rectal cancer consumed more red and
processed meats than their gender-matched controls.

Seventy-six percent of controls were homozygous for the
CYP1A1 wild type (*1 allele). There was no interaction

among red meat consumption, use of red meat cooked at high
temperatures or use of red meat drippings, use of well-done red
meat, or red meat mutagen index and CYP1A1 genotype. The
association of colorectal cancer and poultry consumption ap-
peared to be modiﬁed by the CYP1A1 genotype in men; risk
was constant across the range of poultry intake in men with
the CYP1A1 no variant genotypes and increased across the
range of poultry intake in men with any *2 variant (any
variant of MspI or Ill462Val) of the CYP1A1 genotypes (Table
2). The association of colorectal cancer with white meat
drippings appeared to be modiﬁed by CYP1A1 genotype in
both men and women. In men and women with the CYP1A1
no variant alleles (*1), use of white meat drippings was asso-
ciated with no change in risk, but in men with any *2 variant
of the CYP1A1 genotypes, risk decreased with use of white
meat drippings. In women with any *2 variant alleles of the
CYP1A1 genotypes risk of colorectal cancer increased with use
of white meat drippings 1–36 times per year, but decreased
with more frequent use. Risk of colorectal cancer increased

among women with any *2 variant alleles of the CYP1A1
genotypes and a low white meat mutagen index. The risks of
colorectal cancer associated with CYP1A1 genotype and meat
consumption and preparation were not modiﬁed by age or
estrogen status (data not shown).

The association of red meat consumption with risk for
colorectal cancer was not signiﬁcantly modiﬁed by the com-
bination of CYP1A1 genotypes and GSTM1 genotype (Table
3). Risk of colorectal cancer increased with preference for
well-done red meat among men, but did not differ between
wild and any *2 variant CYP1A1 genotypes. There was a
signiﬁcant interaction among use of white meat drippings,
CYP1A1 genotypes, and risk of colorectal cancer in men.
There was a decreased risk of colorectal cancer associated with
the highest use of white meat drippings in men who had the
CYP1A1 any *2 variant genotype and the GSTM1 present
genotype. The interaction of white meat mutagen index,
CYP1A1 genotype, and GSTM1 genotype indicated an in-
crease in risk among men with a high white meat mutagen

index and any combination of CYP1A1 genotypes and
GSTM1 genotype except any CYP1A1 variant genotypes and
the GSTM1 present genotype where risk was neither elevated
nor decreased. In women, there was a nearly 2-fold increase
with a high red meat mutagen index, with any CYP1A1
variant and GSTM1 present genotypes (OR 1.98, 95% CI
1.06, 3.67).

We found increased risk associated with low white meat
mutagen index and CYP1A1 variant genotype among women
who had the GSTM1 present genotype.

The combination of CYP1A1 genotype and NAT2 imputed
phenotype modiﬁed the association of white meat consump-
tion and use of white meat drippings with risk for colorectal
cancer. Men with the highest consumption of white meat, the
CYP1A1 wild-type genotypes, and the NAT2 slow imputed
phenotype had an increased risk of colorectal cancer (OR
1.40, 95% CI 1.01, 1.95, Table 4). The risk for colorectal
cancer decreased (OR 0.61, 95% CI 0.14, 1.03) among men
with the most frequent use of white meat drippings and the
CYP1A1 variant genotype and the NAT2 rapid imputed phe-
notype. The increased risk associated with a high white meat
mutagen index and CYP1A1 wild genotype occurred primarily
among those men who also had the NAT2 rapid imputed
phenotype (P for multiplicative interaction ⬍ 0.02). An in-
creased risk was also associated with a low white meat mutagen
index in women with the CYP1A1 variant genotype and the
NAT2 slow imputed phenotype, although neither the odds
ratio (OR 1.47, 95%CI 0.88, 2.46) nor the interaction was
signiﬁcant (P ⬎ 0.14).

DISCUSSION

We hypothesized that the risk of colorectal cancer would
increase with consumption of meats cooked at high tempera-
tures and the CYP1A1 22 MspI or Ill462Val polymorphisms.

We detected a decrease in risk of colorectal cancer with any *2
variant alleles of CYP1A1 and white meat drippings in men
and women. Examination of any *2 variant alleles of CYP1A1
with polymorphisms
in phase II metabolizing enzymes
(GSTM1 genotype and NAT2 imputed phenotype) associa-
tions were not always in the direction hypothesized. Previous
studies have found both that NAT2 fast acetylators are not at
greater risk for colorectal cancer when exposed to high levels
of well-cooked meat (35) and that risks associated with con-
sumption of processed meats and a high mutagen index were
strongest with those with the intermediate or fast NAT2
acetylator genotype (15). Characterization of multiple poly-
morphisms in phase I and phase II metabolizing enzymes may
be needed before substantial increases in risk of colorectal
cancer are identiﬁable, even with high exposure to dietary
sources of mutagens.

CYP1A1 plays a role in activation of PAHs and HCAs;
therefore we hypothesized a greater risk of colorectal cancer
with CYP1A1 variants tending to increase enzymatic activity
and greater intake of meats, especially well-done meats or
those cooked at high temperatures. Although red meat is a
suspected risk factor for colorectal cancer (36), and we previ-
ously found a positive association of red meat with colon
cancer (P ⬎ 0.05) and red meat doneness (P ⫽ 0.04) with the
risk of rectal cancer (16) among men, we found that the more
consistent associations detected in this study were with white
meat and white meat drippings. The association of white meat
to colorectal cancer is not consistent, with reports that white
meat is both a signiﬁcant risk factor for colon cancer in men
and women (37) when analyzed separately (15) and associated
with a decreased risk of colorectal adenomas (38). Levels of
HCAs in beef and chicken did not differ (39). Cooking
methods also affects levels of HCA, and a recent report sug-
gested that baked versus pan-fried red and white meats have

different relations to colorectal cancer (40). In the present
study, we asked about the frequency of consumption of baked,
broiled, and fried red and white meats, leaving the possibility
that the associations with fried red meat could be masked by
pooling with baked and broiled meats. We observed an in-
creased risk among men with the CYP1A1 wild type and a
high white meat mutagen index instead of with the variant
genotype, suggesting that activation of HCA by the CYP1A1
variant is not a critical determinant of colorectal cancer risk.
Nonetheless, an increase in DNA adducts from normal mu-
cosa has been reported to be associated with consumption of
white meat in men (41), supporting a role for white meat in
colorectal carcinogenesis. Whether these unexpected results
stem from differences in other aspects of diet that we did not
account for or whether the inﬂuence of the single genotype, in
the context of the complexity of carcinogen metabolism, is not
strong enough for detection is yet unknown.

Whereas CYP1A1 is involved in metabolism of both HCAs
and PAHs, NAT2 plays a role in both detoxiﬁcation and
activation of HCAs, and GSTM1 is involved in the detoxiﬁ-
cation of PCAs. We also found an increased risk of colon, but
not rectal cancer among individuals with at least one variant
allele of the CYP1A1 genotypes examined, GSTM1, null, and
the NAT2-imputed phenotype (17). These ﬁndings support
the notion that modiﬁcation in risk of colon cancer may be
more evident when phase II metabolizing enzymes are exam-
ined in combination with CYP1A1 genotype (17,20,22,35,42–

44). Whereas a Japanese study reported no univariate associ-
ation of CYP1A1 MSP1 or GSTM1 null genotype to colorectal
adenomas in smokers (42), examination of multiple phase I
and phase II metabolizing enzymes previously suggested that
individuals with multiple polymorphisms were at nearly5-fold
greater risk of colorectal cancer (20). Although NAT2 alone
has generally not been reported to be associated with risk of
colon (45), rectal, (32) or colorectal cancer (40,46,47), 2
studies reported an increase in risk of colorectal cancer in
individuals with both the CYP1A2 rapid phenotype and the
NAT2 rapid phenotype (35,43).

We previously reported that the associations of rectal can-
cer, NAT2, and GSTM1 with meat and meat preparation were
not always in the hypothesized direction (16). However, al-
though it is generally thought that risks would increase with
the NAT2 rapid phenotype, the role of NAT2 in both acti-
vation and detoxiﬁcation of HCAs (8,44) makes ﬁndings with
both slow and rapid phenotypes believable. In women, we
found no association of CYP1A1 polymorphisms alone,
GSTM1 polymorphisms alone, or red meat mutagen alone
with colon (15)and rectal cancer (16), but we did ﬁnd a
positive association with the CYP1A1 *2 genotype, the
GSTM1 present genotype, and the red meat mutagen index.
Previous ﬁndings include inverse associations of poultry and
ﬁsh with colorectal cancer among those with GSTM1 pheno-
types, which was attributed to confounding of other healthy
habits (47). Lin and colleagues described a lower risk of

colorectal adenomas among GSTM1 absent genotypes with
high broccoli intake, presumably due to higher isothiocyanate
levels (48). Therefore, it is difﬁcult to discern which associa-
tions might be spurious and which might appropriately reﬂect
activation or detoxiﬁcation activities.

We did not directly measure heterocyclic amines and poly-
cyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, but inferred their intake by
asking questions about preference for doneness of meat and
preparation method. Strengths of the study include rigorous
quality control procedures (23) and in-depth dietary assess-
ment that included detailed meat preparation questions (24 –
26). Gender differences in association are difﬁcult to reconcile;
however, few studies have reported gender-speciﬁc interac-
tions of gene environment associations, likely due to sample
size issues. Biological plausibility of gender differences is sup-
ported by reports that estrogen may stimulate manganese and
superoxide dismutase (antioxidants), inﬂuence gastrointestinal
motility in pregnancy (49), protect against microsatellite in-
stability in colorectal cancer (50), and be associated with
increased risk of Crohn’s disease (51). We cannot rule out the
possibility of recall bias for information recalled for up to 2 y
prior to cancer diagnosis or case selection. It is possible that
the time frame of measurements of exposure (diet and lifestyle)
does not coincide with the pathological process and, if so,
meaningful associations may be missed. Random measurement
error and misclassiﬁcation in measurement of diet, as well as
lifestyle factors, generally results in attenuation of associations
whereas multiple comparisons increase the likelihood of spu-
rious ﬁndings. Given the unexpected directions of some of the
ﬁndings, the possibility that one or more of the reported
associations might be spurious should be the subject of further
research.

These data suggest a modest decrease in the risk of colo-
rectal cancer among individuals who have the CYP1A1 any *2
variant genotype and consume white meat prepared at high
temperatures or white meat drippings. Risk increased among
women with a high red meat mutagen index, CYP1A1 any *2
variant genotype, and the GSTM1 present genotype. Associ-
ations of white meat mutagen index and white meat dripping
use with risk of colorectal cancer was more evident within
select subgroups of individuals with the CYP1A1 any *2 vari-
ant genotype combined with one of the GSTM1 present
genotype or the intermediate/rapid NAT2 imputed phenotype
than with CYP1A1 alone. Genetic susceptibility conferred by
polymorphisms in CYP1A1 alone and in combination with
NAT2 intermediate/rapid imputed phenotype and GSTM1

ABSTRACT Meat consumption, particularly of red and processed meat, is one of the most thoroughly studied
dietary factors in relation to colon cancer. However, it is not clear whether meat, red meat, heterocyclic amines
(HCA), or polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) are associated with the risk for rectal cancer. Rectal cancer
cases (n ⫽ 952) and controls (n ⫽ 1205) from Utah and Northern California were recruited from a population-based
case-control study between September 1997 and February 2002. Detailed in-person interviews regarding lifestyle,
medical history, and diet were conducted. DNA was extracted from peripheral
lymphocytes obtained from
whole-blood samples, and glutathione S-transferase (GST)M1 enzyme and N-acetyl transferase (NAT)2 enzyme
genotypes were assessed. Although energy and cholesterol
intakes were higher among cases than controls,
adjustment for confounders accounted for the differences. Increased consumption of well-done red meat [odds
ratio (OR) 1.33 95% CI 0.98, 1.79] was associated with an (P ⫽ 0.04) increase in risk for rectal cancer among men.
The mutagen index, calculated on the bases of reported amount, doneness, and method of cooking meat, was also
positively but not signiﬁcantly (P ⫽ 0.24) associated with risk of rectal cancer for men (OR 1.37 95% CI 0.98, 1.92).
NAT2-imputed phenotype and GSTM1 did not consistently modify rectal cancer risk associated with meat intake.
These data suggest that mutagens such as HCA that form when meat is cooked may be culpable substances in
rectal cancer risk, not red meat itself.

KEY WORDS:

●

rectal cancer ● meat ● heterocyclic amines ● polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons

Meat consumption, particularly red and processed meat
consumption, is one of the most thoroughly studied dietary
risk factors for colon cancer. Meat was examined initially
because of its fat content, which could inﬂuence the bile acid
content of the gut, but has been studied more recently with
regard to other attributes. Mutagen content (1,2), meat prep-
aration (2), the role of meat in dietary patterns (3), and types
of meat (4 – 6) have been studied. On the bases of other risk
factors and site-speciﬁc analyses reported, it is highly plausible
that the risk factors for colon and rectal cancer may be
different. Some studies report stronger associations for distal
tumors than proximal (7), although few studies have reported
the association of meat consumption with risk for rectal cancer
alone (2).

It is not clear whether the association between meat con-
sumption and colorectal cancer is from the consumption of

meat, or if it arises from meat preparation methods that gen-
erate higher
levels of carcinogenic heterocyclic amines
(HCAs),4 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), or other
compounds. HCAs are formed as a by-product of reactions
during the cooking of meat (beef, pork,
lamb), poultry
(chicken) and ﬁsh especially when they are char-broiled or
roasted (8 –14). Dietary exposure to HCAs has been a sus-
pected risk factor for colorectal cancer since the 1970s (15).
Exposure to PAH in food is one of the primary sources of
exposure to PAH in the United States (16).

An inherited variation in metabolism of HCA and PAH
compounds may modify cancer risk associated with these ex-
posures. Metabolism of certain mutagenic forms of PAH can
be detoxiﬁed by the glutathione S-transferase (GST)M1 en-
zyme. The GSTM1 null variant associated with no activity
may, therefore, be associated with altered risk of cancers (17).
The N-acetyl transferase (NAT)2 enzyme catalyzes O-acety-
lation of HCAs to form compounds that bind covalently to
DNA (18); therefore, inherited low-activity variants may play
a role in the etiology of rectal cancer.

MEAT, ENZYME VARIANTS, AND RECTAL CANCER

777

We previously reported a slight increase in risk of colon
cancer among men with the highest consumption of processed
meat [odds ratio (OR) 1.4 95% CI 1.0 –1.9] and the highest
level of mutagen index (an estimate of exposure to mutagenic
or carcinogenic substances, OR 1.3 95% CI 1.0 –1.7) (1).
Although no independent associations with colon cancer were
observed for NAT2 and GSTM1 genotypes, associations with
processed meat consumption (OR 1.5 95% CI 1.1–2.0) and
the mutagen index (OR 1.3, 95% CI 1.0 –1.7) were increased
among those with the intermediate or rapid type acetylator
phenotype. Interestingly, the associations of the mutagen in-
dex were stronger among both men and women with distal
colon tumors compared with those with proximal tumors. The
possibility that PAH may be directly related to rectal cancer
risk or interact with PAH exposure is supported by the ﬁnding
that GSTM1 absent genotypes are found more frequently
among adenocarcinomas than in noncancerous polyps (7) and
more distally in the intestinal tract (37% in the right colon,
44% in left colon, and 60% in the rectum).

We hypothesized that NAT2-imputed phenotype and
GSTM1 genotype may interact with meat consumption or
meat preparation to alter rectal cancer risk. Using methodol-
ogy and variable deﬁnitions similar to those of our previous
study (1), we investigated whether the associations between
meat consumption, meat preparation method and the risk for
rectal cancer in men and women from Utah and California
were modiﬁed by NAT2 imputed phenotype and GSTM1
genotype.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS

Participants. The institutional review boards at each participat-
ing institution approved the methods. Cases with a ﬁrst primary
tumor in the rectosigmoid junction or rectum were identiﬁed between
May 1997 and May 2001 using a rapid-reporting system. Case eligi-
bility was determined in Northern California by the Surveillance
Epidemiology and End Results Cancer Registries and in Utah using a
rapid-reporting system. An on-line pathology reporting system was
searched for rapid case ascertainment of rectal cancer cases at Kaiser
Permanente Northern California Cancer Registry (KPMCP). Cases
identiﬁed were conﬁrmed through linkage to the KPMCP. Cases with
a previous colorectal tumor were not eligible for the study. Cases with
known (as indicated on the pathology report) familial adenomatous
polyposis, ulcerative colitis, or Crohn’s disease were not eligible. In
addition to these criteria, participants were between 30 and 79 y old
at time of diagnosis, English speaking, and mentally competent to
complete the interview.

Controls were frequency matched to cases by sex and by 5-y age
groups. Education level and ethnicity did not differ between cases and
controls of each gender (19). At the KPMCP, controls were randomly
selected from membership lists, and in Utah, controls ⱖ65 y old were
randomly selected from social security lists and controls ⬍65 y old
were randomly selected from driver’s license lists. The race/ethnicity
of the study population was reported at the time of interview as 82%
white, non-Hispanic, 7.3% Hispanic white, 4.1% African American,
not Hispanic, 0.2% Hispanic African American, 4.6% Asian, 0.7%
American Indian, and 1.1% multiple races/ethnicity. A total of 952
rectal cancer cases and 1205 matched controls are included in the
analyses presented. Response rates were 65.2% for cases and 65.3%
for controls; cooperation rates, or the number of people who partic-
ipated from those whom we were able to contact, were 73.2% for
cases and 68.8% for controls.

Interview. Diet and other exposure data were collected during
in-person interviews conducted by trained and certiﬁed interviewers
using laptop computers. The interview took ⬃2 h. Quality control
methods used in the study were the same as those used in the colon
cancer study and were described in detail elsewhere (7,8).

Diet. Dietary intake was ascertained using an adaptation of the
CARDIA diet history (8,12). Participants were asked to recall foods
eaten for the calendar year occurring 2 y before their cancer diagnosis

(cases) or recruitment into the study (controls), the frequency that
they were eaten, serving size, and whether fats were added in the
preparation. Nutrient information was obtained by converting food
intake data into nutrient data using the Minnesota Nutrition Coor-
dinating Center nutrient database Version 4.04_30. Additional in-
formation was gathered on usual doneness of meats (rare, medium-
rare, medium-well done, and well done). Participants were asked how
frequently red meats, ﬁsh, and poultry were fried, broiled, baked, or
barbequed (cooked at high temperatures) and how frequently drip-
pings were used in other foods or gravies. Variables included servings
of particular foods or food groups (i.e., red meat, poultry, and red meat
drippings) consumed per day, week, or year. The mutagen index was
calculated as the frequency of red meat, poultry, and ﬁsh consumption
prepared by frying, broiling, baking, or barbecuing plus the use of
drippings from red meat, poultry, or ﬁsh, multiplied by the usual
doneness of red meat, poultry, and ﬁsh (1 ⫽ rare, 2 ⫽ medium rare,
3 ⫽ medium-well, and 4 ⫽ well done) and the microwave factor (1
⫽ microwave never used or used for thawing, 0.75 ⫽ sometimes used,
0.50 ⫽ often used, 0.25 ⫽ always used). A higher index reﬂects a
higher intake of potentially mutagenic compounds.

Genetic data. Blood was drawn from study participants and
DNA was extracted. The GSTM1 null and present genotypes were
detected using the multiplex PCR method described by Zhong and
colleagues (20). The PCR products were run on a 2% agarose gel and
stained with ethidium bromide. If the only product displayed is the
157 bp gene fragment, it is classiﬁed as GSTM1 null, whereas if both
bands are present, it is classiﬁed as GSTM1 present.

Three variants of NAT2 were assessed, using the method of Bell
et al. (21) to determine acetylator status of three variants that
account for ⬃90 –95% of the slow acetylation phenotype in Cauca-
sians. All three variants could be identiﬁed from one PCR product
and be digested with three different restriction enzymes. The C481T
variant was determined using a Kpn1 digest, the G590A variant using
a Taq1 digest, and the G857A variant using a Bam H1 digest.
Subjects with at least 2 variant alleles were classiﬁed as slow acety-
lators, whereas those with 1 or 0 variant alleles were classiﬁed as fast
acetylators.

Other information. Height (m) and weight (kg) were measured at
the time of interview, and weight was reported for the 2 and 5 y before
the interview. The BMI (kg/m2) was calculated for men and women.
Physical activity data were collected using a detailed questionnaire
(19,22). Estrogen-negative status was deﬁned as postmenopausal women
not taking hormone replacement and estrogen-positive status was de-
ﬁned as premenopausal women and postmenopausal women taking hor-
mone replacement.

Statistical methods. The SAS statistical package, version 8.2, CA,
was used to conduct the analysis. We previously observed gender differ-
ences in diet-gene interactions associated with the risk of rectal cancer;
therefore, gender-stratiﬁed analyses were pursued. Dietary data were
assessed by determining risk across true medians, thirds, or quartiles of
intake, or by other speciﬁc cut-off values deﬁned for previous analyses (1)
depending on the distribution of the data. The true medians, thirds, or
quartiles were determined by the sex-speciﬁc intake distribution in the
control population. In these models, the following variables were in-
cluded: age at selection, BMI, physical activity, energy intake, dietary
ﬁber, dietary calcium, and cigarette smoking status. Further confounding
by cancer screening was assessed, but was found not to signiﬁcantly
confound associations. Linear trend was determined by evaluating the
signiﬁcance of linear association across the categorized variable. GSTM1
was analyzed as being present or absent; NAT2-imputed phenotype was
analyzed as either slow or intermediate/rapid imputed. Interaction or
effect modiﬁcations between meat-related variables and GSTM1 and
NAT2-imputed phenotype were evaluated as the excess risk on both
additive (23) and multiplicative scales. Interactions between meat and
meat preparation variables and combinations of the genotypes or im-
puted phenotype were also evaluated on both additive and multiplicative
scales.

proportion of energy intake from fat and protein did not differ
between cases and controls of both genders. Cholesterol intake
(mg/d) was greater among cases than controls of both genders.
Female cases consumed more red meat (servings/wk) and pro-
cessed meat (servings/wk) than female controls.

We reported previously that there were no signiﬁcant as-
sociations between NAT2 and GSTM1 genotypes and the risk
of rectal cancer in men or women (24). Approximately 45% of
men and 50% of women had the rapid acetylator NAT2-
imputed phenotype. The GSTM1 present genotype occurred
in ⬃49% of men and 45% of women.

We examined the association of intake of red and processed
meats and poultry with risk of rectal cancer and found no
signiﬁcant trends in men or women after adjustment for pos-
sible confounders of the association with rectal cancer (Tables
2 and 3). Further adjustment for sigmoidoscopy during the
past 10 y did not change the interpretation of the results (data
not shown). Although there was a tendency toward increased
risk above the lowest level of intake of processed meats in
women and among men in the highest tertile of intake, the
associations were not signiﬁcant (P for trend ⫽ 0.31 and 0.28,
respectively).

When we examined the association of aspects of meat
consumption and preparation with the risk of rectal cancer,
risk increased among men who reported eating fried, broiled,

baked, or barbequed white meat more than 2 times/mo (Table
2). Risk increased ⬃33% among men who reported consuming
well-done red meats (P ⫽ 0.04), 39% with the highest red
meat mutagen index (P ⫽ 0.04), and increased nearly 40% (P
⫽ 0.04) among men with a high overall mutagen index.
Further adjustment for sigmoidoscopy did not signiﬁcantly
alter the results (data not shown). Stratiﬁcation by age (⬍65
y vs. ⱖ65 y) did not reveal consistent differences in risks by
age (data not shown). Among women, there was no associa-
tion of frequent consumption of red meat, preparing foods at
high temperatures, or mutagen indices and the risk of rectal
cancer. However, consumption of red meat drippings ⱖ1
time/wk was associated with an unexpected nonsigniﬁcant
decrease in risk of rectal cancer (P ⫽ 0.27).

We also examined the interaction of meat consumption,
preparation, and mutagen index with NAT2-imputed pheno-
type and GSTM1 genotypes by gender. The associations of
meat consumption and preparation with risk of rectal cancer
generally did not differ between those with the slow NAT2
imputed phenotype and those with the rapid or intermediate
acetylator phenotype (Tables 4 and 5). Among men (Table
4), consumption of well-done red meat was associated with a
greater increase in risk among those who were rapid acetylators
(P for multiplicative interaction ⫽ 0.09) compared with those
who were slow acetylators. However, risk was increased with a

Among women (Table 5), having the rapid or intermediate

0.14 –1.57) was associated with an unexpected [relative excess
risk due to interaction (RERI), P ⫽ 0.01, P for multiplicative
interaction ⫽ 0.14] reduced risk of rectal cancer. Rectal cancer
risk decreased among women who were slow acetylators and
who ate high levels of red meat drippings; this was particularly
true for estrogen-positive women (n ⫽ 23 cases, 29 controls,
OR 0.34 95% CI 0.17, 0.68). Further adjustment for screening
by sigmoidoscopy did not substantially change results (data not
shown).

Among men with the GSTM1 absent genotype, high levels
of the red meat mutagen index resulted in increased risk of
rectal cancer (OR 1.72 95% CI 1.04, 2.83) compared with
men with the GSTM1 genotype present (RERI P ⫽ 0.15)
(Table 6). The risk associated with meat and meat preparation
variables tended (P ⬎ 0.05) to be lower among women with
the GSTM1 null than the GSTM1 present genotype (Table
7). Unexpectedly, higher risk was observed among those
women with the GSTM1 present genotype who consumed the

smallest amount of poultry, particularly estrogen-positive
women (n ⫽ 28 cases, 22, controls OR 2.87 95% CI 1.34,
6.17). A lower risk of rectal cancer was also observed among
women with the GSTM1 present genotype, a low white meat
mutagen index (RERI P ⫽ 0.17, P for multiplicative interac-
tion ⫽ 0.29), and overall mutagen index (RERI P ⫽ 0.83, P
for multiplicative interaction ⫽ 0.54), although the interac-
tions were not signiﬁcant. Among women with the GSTM1
present genotype, there was a twofold increase in risk associ-
ated with high processed meat intake relative to women with
the GSTM1 absent genotype and low intake of processed
meats, particularly among estrogen-negative women (n ⫽ 34
cases, 22 controls OR 2.68 95% CI 1.02, 7.05).

DISCUSSION

The present study does not support a strong association
between red, white, or processed meat consumption and the
risk of rectal cancer in men or women. Results for doneness of
meat and mutagen index are consistent with the hypothesis
that HCAs are responsible for the increase in risk for rectal
cancer in men. Unexpectedly, in women, use of red meat
drippings was associated with a decreased risk of rectal cancer.
This decrease was greater among women with the slow NAT2-
imputed phenotype and the GSTM-1 absent genotype.

Our results are in contrast with earlier work on the associ-
ation of meat with rectal cancer (2,25) and colorectal cancer
(26 –28). A Dutch prospective study suggested an increased
risk of colorectal cancer with increased red meat intake among
men, but a decreased risk associated with poultry and ﬁsh
intake among women, which might be accounted for by the
substitution of poultry and ﬁsh for red meat (28). Among
Chinese in Singapore, protein and the ratio of meat:vegetable
consumption were inversely associated with the risk for rectal
cancer (3). Senesse et al. (29) observed opposite associations
of fatty meats (positive) and lean meats (inverse) with the risk
of adenomas in the right and left colon and rectum, suggesting
that associations with rectal cancer could be substantially
inﬂuenced by the composition of total meat intake or in the
context of the whole diet. It is difﬁcult to assess whether these
different ﬁndings are related to differences in study methods,
study populations, usual diets, and/or proportions of meats or
preparation methods of meat in the diet.

Our results suggest a modest, nonsigniﬁcant increase in the
risk of rectal cancer with consumption of well-done meat and
white meat cooked at high temperatures (fried, baked, broiled,
or barbecued) among men. A Swedish case-control study
reported (2) a positive association of well-browned meats with
rectal cancer, but did not report whether the results differed if

they were stratiﬁed by gender. Our failure to ﬁnd an associa-
tion with meat intake per se suggests that HCAs or other
carcinogens created by cooking meat at high temperatures
could be responsible for the increase in risk. The biological
plausibility is supported by the ﬁnding that the HCA 2-amino-
3– 8 dimethylimidazo quinoxaline (4,5) was associated with an
increase in the risk for colorectal adenomas even after adjust-
ing for consumption of red meat, suggesting that the HCA was
the culpable substance, not red meat.

It is not immediately clear why gender differences were
observed, but differences in background diet, levels of expo-
sure, and metabolism cannot be ruled out. We examined
gender differences because of our previous ﬁndings of differ-
ences in associations of intake of antioxidants to rectal cancer
by gender (30). Although some ﬁndings were evident only in
estrogen-positive or estrogen-negative women, small cell sizes
limit our conﬁdence in such ﬁndings. Any explanation at this
point would be speculative and would have to be veriﬁed in
other populations. It is also possible that these are chance
ﬁndings with no biological relevance.

We found that acetylator status appeared to modify the risk
of rectal cancer, but not consistently in the direction expected.
In agreement with our previous report on colon cancer (1),
men who had the rapid or intermediate acetylator phenotype

and who consumed well-done meat had a greater increase in
the risk for rectal cancer than men with the slow acetylator
imputed phenotype. In women with the NAT2 slow acetylator
imputed phenotype, use of red meat drippings at least once a
week was associated with a decreased risk for rectal cancer. It
is expected that for substances for which N-acetylation is a
detoxiﬁcation step, NAT2 slow acetylators are at increased
risk, but for substances for which O-acetylation is an activa-
tion step, rapid acetylators would be expected to be at greater
risk (31). It is not clear whether our ﬁndings actually represent
differential risks from N-acetylation and O-acetylation be-
cause they could arise from multiple comparisons, residual
confounding, interaction with another phase I or II metabo-
lizing enzyme, or reﬂection of the metabolism of some other
substance.

Although the possibility that PAH may be directly related
to rectal cancer risk is supported by the ﬁnding that GSTM1
absent genotypes are found more frequently among cancerous
tissues than in noncancerous tissues (7) and more distally in
the intestinal tract, we found little evidence to support a direct
association of GSTM1 genotype to risk for rectal cancer. An
inverse association of ﬁsh or poultry to risk for colorectal
cancer among those with GSTM1 present genotypes was re-
ported (28) and attributed to residual confounding of other
healthy habits. Although we did not ﬁnd an inverse associa-
tion with ﬁsh or poultry and rectal cancer risk, residual con-

founding of other healthy habits is plausible because PAH may
be found in cereals and grain products, fruits, vegetables, and
processed meat.

Heterocyclic amines and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons
were not directly measured in this study. Instead, we inferred
their intake from responses to questions about preference for
doneness of meat and preparation method. Recall may be
different for cases than controls based on the momentous
event of cancer diagnosis, thus creating a potential bias in
reported information. Strengths of the study include in-depth
dietary assessment and questioning regarding meat preparation
as well as rigorous quality control procedures (7,8). Gender
differences are difﬁcult to reconcile; however, few studies have
shown gender-speciﬁc interactions of gene-environment asso-
ciations, likely due to sample size issues. These ﬁndings, based
on the largest case-control study of diet, lifestyle, and rectal
cancer, enable us to assess potential gender-speciﬁc interac-
tions with metabolic enzyme polymorphisms and add to the
knowledge base for the etiology of rectal cancer.

Abstract

Background: Chronic inﬂammation is one of the mechanisms involved in carcinogenesis. Diet is a major source of pro- and

anti-inﬂammatory compounds. The Dietary Inﬂammatory Index (DII) was designed to estimate its overall inﬂammatory potential.

Objective: Our objective was to investigate the associations between the DII and overall, breast, and prostate cancer

risks.
Methods: This prospective study included 6542 participants [3771 women and 2771 men with a mean 6 SD age of 49.2 6
6.4 y and a BMI (in kg/m2) of 24.0 6 3.6 at baseline] from the Suppl ´ementation en VItamines et Min ´eraux AntioXydants

(SU.VI.MAX) cohort who completed at least six 24-h dietary records during the ﬁrst 2 y of follow-up. The DII was based on

36 food variables. Higher scores corresponded to more proinﬂammatory diets. A total of 559 incident cancers were

diagnosed (median follow-up, 12.6 y), including 158 female breast and 123 prostate cancers (the 2 main cancer sites in this

cohort). Associations were characterized by multivariable Cox proportional hazards models. Stratiﬁed analyses were

performed according to the median of usual daily alcohol intake.

Results: Sex-speciﬁc quartiles of the DII were positively associated with prostate cancer risk [quartile (Q) 4 compared with

Q1, HR: 2.08; 95% CI: 1.06, 4.09] but not with overall or breast cancer risks. There was an interaction between the DII and
alcohol intake (grams per day) on overall cancer risk (P-interaction = 0.02): the DII was positively associated with overall
cancer risk in low-to-moderate alcohol drinkers (Q4 compared with Q1 HR: 1.75; 95% CI: 1.15, 2.68; P-trend = 0.02),
whereas no association was detected in higher consumers of alcohol (P-trend = 0.8). This interaction was also observed
for breast cancer (P-interaction = 0.001).

Conclusion: Consistent with mechanistic data, ﬁndings from this study indicated that proinﬂammatory diets are

associated with increased prostate cancer risk and, in low-to-moderate alcohol drinkers, with increased overall and breast
cancer risk. The SU.VI.MAX trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00272428. J Nutr 2016;146:785–91.

Introduction

The involvement of chronic inﬂammation in carcinogenesis is
increasingly acknowledged.
In many experimental studies,
inﬂammatory mechanisms involving inﬂammatory cells and
signaling pathways also have been described as promoting
carcinogenesis (1). Moreover, as reported by 2 meta-analyses (2,
3), epidemiologic studies have shown associations between
inﬂammatory biomarkers such as C-reactive protein (CRP)10
and IL-6 and an increased risk of overall and lung cancer. A

previous prospective study nested in the Suppl´ementation en
VItamines et Min´eraux AntioXydants (SU.VI.MAX) cohort
found that baseline high-sensitivity CRP was associated with an
increased overall cancer and prostate cancer risk (4).

A growing body of literature has investigated the inﬂuence of
diet on chronic inﬂammation (5–8). Indeed, diet is a major
source of bioactive compounds for which either pro- or anti-
inﬂammatory properties have been identiﬁed (9). The Dietary
Inﬂammatory Index (DII) is a literature-derived scoring system

that was developed to estimate the pro- and anti-inﬂammatory
potential of the overall diet and to investigate its possible
relations with chronic diseases (9).

Globally, cancer is one of the leading causes of death, with
about one-third of cancers attributed to unhealthy lifestyle and
dietary behaviors,
i.e., modiﬁable risk factors (10). To our
knowledge, few studies have investigated the pro- or anti-
inﬂammatory potential of the diet, measured with the DII, in
relation to cancer risk (11–23). Moreover, only 4 of these studies
were based on a prospective design and focused on colorectal
cancer (16, 18, 19) or lung cancer (14). The associations
between DII and female breast cancer (13) or prostate cancer
(12, 17) have only been explored in nonprospective case-control
studies.

Therefore, our objective was to investigate the relations
between the DII and overall, female breast, and prostate cancer
risks in a large French prospective cohort.

Methods

Study population. The SU.VI.MAX study is a population-based
double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial (NCT00272428)
initially designed to assess the effect of a daily antioxidant supplemen-
tation on coronary heart disease and cancer incidence. All participants
took a single daily capsule containing a combination of 120 mg of
ascorbic acid, 30 mg of vitamin E, 6 mg of b-carotene, 100 mg of
selenium, and 20 mg of zinc, or a placebo (24). Participants were advised
against taking any self-prescribed supplements during the trial. The
study was conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki guidelines
and was approved by the Ethics Committee for Studies with Human
Subjects at the Paris-Cochin Hospital (CCPPRB No. 706) and the
Commission Nationale de lÕInformatique et des Libert´es (French
National Commission for Computed Data and Individual Freedom)
(CNIL No. 334641). During the ﬁrst-year study, 13,017 subjects were
enrolled (1994–1995) and health events monitoring was pursued until
September 2007. Written informed consent was obtained from all
participants.

Baseline data collection. At enrollment, all participants completed
questionnaires on sociodemographics, smoking status, physical activity,
and medication use. They also underwent a clinical examination and
anthropometric measurements by study nurses and physicians. Age at
menopause (natural or artiﬁcial) was self-reported by women during
follow-up.

Dietary data were collected with the use of the Minitel Telematic
Network (an Internet prototype), which was widely used in France as an
adjunct to the telephone at the beginning of the study. During the trial

phase, participants were invited to provide a 24-h dietary record every
2 mo (randomly distributed over weekend and week days). In order to
comply with the prospective design, dietary records from the ﬁrst 2 y of
follow-up were used in the present study. The participants selected the
foods consumed at breakfast, lunch, dinner, and/or any other occasion
throughout the day from a predeﬁned list of ;1000 items. Portion sizes
were estimated with the use of a validated picture booklet distributed at
enrollment (25). Energy, alcohol (grams per day), and nutrient intake
was estimated with the use of a published French food composition table
(26).

DII computation. The computation of the DII was previously described
in detail (9). Steps involved in the DII calculation can be found in
Supplemental Figure 1. Brieﬂy, the DII is a score initially designed with
45 dietary variables determined from a literature review of 1943 articles
published up to 2010. A literature-derived inﬂammatory effect score was
assigned to every micronutrient, macronutrient, or food variable
associated with an increase (+1), a decrease (21), or no effect (0) on 6
major inﬂammatory biomarkers, including IL-1b, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-a,
and CRP.

Mean intake of every food variable was transformed with standard-
ized values from a world database into a z score, then converted to a
percentile and centered. Finally, the centered percentile score for each
food variable was multiplied by its associated coefﬁcient, then these were
summed across the 45 dietary variables, thus providing an individual DII
score. In the present study, the DII was based on 36 dietary variables
available in the database. Total intake of energy, protein, carbohydrate,
total fat, SFAs, cholesterol, vitamin B-12, and iron were computed into
the score as proinﬂammatory factors, whereas dietary intake of MUFAs,
PUFAs, n–3 FAs, n–6 FAs, alcohol, ﬁber, magnesium, niacin, thiamin,
riboﬂavin, vitamin B-6, vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin D, vitamin E, folic
acid, b-carotene, anthocyanidins, ﬂavan-3-ol, ﬂavonols, ﬂavanones,
ﬂavones, isoﬂavones, garlic, ginger, pepper, onions, and tea were entered
as anti-inﬂammatory factors. Theoretical DII scores ranged from 28.9
(maximally anti-inﬂammatory diet) to +8.0 (maximally proinﬂamma-
tory diet). Higher DII scores indicated a more proinﬂammatory diet.

Case ascertainment. Major health events were self-reported by subjects
during follow-up (between inclusion in 1994 and September 2007).
Investigations allowed collection of medical case data from participants
themselves, physicians, and/or hospitals. An independent expert com-
mittee of physicians reviewed the medical information. Cases were
validated through a pathologic report and classiﬁed with the use of the
International Classiﬁcation of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modiﬁ-
cation (27). All ﬁrst-incident primary cancers were considered as cases in
this study, except for basal cell carcinoma (not considered to be cancer).

Statistical analysis. Of the 13,017 participants of the SU.VI.MAX
study, 161 were excluded because of a cancer diagnosis reported before
the start of the follow-up. Of the remaining participants, 6542 provided
$6 valid 24-h dietary records within the ﬁrst 2 y of follow-up, and thus
were available for analysis. For all covariates, <5% of values were
missing and were replaced by the respective mode value.

Baseline characteristics of participants were compared between cases
and noncases with the use of x2 tests or StudentÕs t tests, as appropriate.
HRs and 95% CIs obtained from Cox proportional hazards models
with age as the primary time variable were used to characterize the
association between sex-speciﬁc quartiles of the DII and overall, female
breast, and prostate cancer risk. Participants contributed person-time
until the date of diagnosis of the studied cancer, the date of the last
completed questionnaire, the date of death, or 30 September 2007,
whichever occurred ﬁrst. Participants who reported a cancer other than
the one studied during the follow-up were included and censored at the
date of that diagnosis (except for basal cell carcinoma, which was not
considered to be cancer). We conﬁrmed that the assumptions of
proportionality were satisﬁed through examination of the log–log

(survival) compared with log–time plots. The SAS macro %RCS_Reg
(28) was used to test for a possible threshold effect and to select the most
appropriate cutoff.

Multivariable models were adjusted for age (time-scale in the Cox
model), sex, intervention group of the initial SU.VI.MAX trial (antiox-
idant or placebo), number of dietary records (continuous), BMI (in kg/
m2) (<25, $25 to <30, or $30), height (continuous), physical activity
(irregular, <1 h/d, or $1 h walking or equivalent/d), smoking status
(never, former, or current), educational level (primary, secondary, or
university), family history of cancer in ﬁrst-degree relatives (yes or no),
daily mean energy intake without alcohol
(kilocalories per day;
continuous), and daily mean alcohol intake (grams per day; continuous).
For breast cancer analyses, additional adjustments were performed for
menopausal status at baseline (yes or no), use of hormonal treatment for
menopause at baseline (yes or no), number of live births (continuous),
and family history of breast cancer in ﬁrst-degree relatives (yes or no).
For prostate cancer analyses, additional adjustments were applied for
prostate-speciﬁc antigen concentration at baseline (continuous) and
family history of prostate cancer in ﬁrst-degree relatives (yes or no).

Because alcohol intake is an important risk factor for several cancer
sites (29) and is considered to be an anti-inﬂammatory factor in
formulating the DII (9), we tested the interaction between alcohol intake
(sex-speciﬁc population median) and DII (sex-speciﬁc quartiles). Anal-
yses were conducted overall and then stratiﬁed by alcohol intake. Two-
factor interactions were also tested between the DII and the intervention
group of the initial SU.VI.MAX trial, BMI, and sex.

Models also were computed separately for premenopausal and
postmenopausal breast cancer (women contributed to the premeno-
pausal model until their age of menopause, or from their age of
menopause, respectively). Sensitivity analyses were carried out while
excluding cancer cases diagnosed during the ﬁrst year of follow-up. All
tests were 2-sided, and P < 0.05 was considered to be statistically
signiﬁcant. SAS software version 9.3 was used for analyses.

The interaction between sex-speciﬁc quartiles of the DII and
alcohol intake (sex-speciﬁc median, i.e., 6.6 g/d for women and
24.1 g/d for men) on overall cancer risk was statistically
signiﬁcant (P-interaction = 0.02) (Table 3). In stratiﬁed analyses,
the DII was positively associated with overall cancer risk in low-
to-moderate alcohol consumers (Q4 compared with Q1 HR:
1.75; 95% CI: 1.15, 2.68; P-trend = 0.02), but not in higher
consumers of alcohol (P-trend = 0.8). This interaction was also
observed for breast cancer (P-interaction = 0.001): DII was
positively associated with breast cancer risk in low-to-moderate
alcohol consumers (Q4 compared with Q1 HR: 3.82; 95% CI:
1.51, 9.64; P-trend = 0.002). An inverse association was detected
in higher consumers of alcohol (Q4 compared with Q1 HR: 0.31;
95% CI: 0.15, 0.65; P-trend = 0.005). The P-interaction between
the DII and alcohol intake was 0.8 for prostate cancer.

The interaction test between sex-speciﬁc quartiles of the DII
and the antioxidant supplementation group from the initial
SU.VI.MAX trial was not statistically signiﬁcant (P-interaction =
0.9 for overall cancer, P-interaction = 0.4 for breast cancer, and
P-interaction = 0.4 for prostate cancer). DII scores ranked from
25.0 to 5.8 in the antioxidant supplementation arm (mean 6
SD: 0.7 6 1.8) and from 25.1 to 6.0 in the placebo arm (mean 6
SD: 0.7 6 1.9). No interaction was observed between the DII
and sex (P-interaction = 0.3 for overall cancer) or BMI (P-
interaction = 0.4 for overall cancer, P-interaction = 0.1 for breast
cancer, and P-interaction = 0.6 for prostate cancer). Exclusion of
in situ cancer cases (n = 47) or exclusion of cancer cases
diagnosed during the ﬁrst year of follow-up (n = 11) provided
similar ﬁndings (data not shown). Breast cancer results were
similar in pre- and postmenopausal women (data not shown).

Results
Median follow-up was 12.6 y. DII scores ranked from 25.1 to
6.0 for women (mean 6 SD: 1.0 6 1.8) and 25.0 to 5.3 for men
(mean 6 SD: 0.3 6 1.8). A total of 5.2% of the subjects were lost
to follow-up. During follow-up, a total of 559 incident cancers
(512 invasive and 47 in situ) were diagnosed, including 158
female breast, 123 prostate, and 278 other cancers (including 51
skin, 32 colorectal, 19 thyroid, 15 lung, and 161 other cancers).
Regarding female breast cancer cases, 59% were estrogen
receptor–positive and 43% were progesterone receptor–positive.
Among prostate cancer cases, 5% had a Gleason score between
2 and 4, 87% between 5 and 7, and 8% between 8 and 10. Study
population characteristics are described in Table 1. Compared
with those without cancer, those with cancer (overall) were older
and taller; were more frequently male; had a slightly higher
number of children, higher alcohol intake, and a higher baseline
plasma prostate-speciﬁc antigen concentration (in men); and had
more family members with a history of cancer.

The associations between sex-speciﬁc quartiles of the DII and
risk of overall, female breast, prostate, and nonbreast/
nonprostate cancers are represented in Table 2. Higher sex-
speciﬁc quartiles of the DII were positively associated with
prostate cancer risk [quartile (Q) 4 compared with Q1 HR: 2.08;
95% CI: 1.06, 4.09]. The observed results suggested a possible
threshold effect, conﬁrmed in a dose–response analysis with the
use of restricted cubic splines (see Supplemental Figure 2). A
cutoff of 21.0 was selected. An increased risk of prostate cancer
was observed for a DII value greater than or equal to 21.0
compared with a DII less than 21.0 (HR: 2.31; 95% CI: 1.35,
3.95; P = 0.002). No signiﬁcant relation was found regarding
overall, female breast, and nonbreast/nonprostate cancer risks.

Discussion

In this prospective study, a proinﬂammatory diet corresponding
to higher DII scores was associated with an increased prostate
cancer risk. In addition, when analyses were stratiﬁed by alcohol
intake, which is a major risk factor for several cancer sites, the
DII also was associated with increased overall and breast cancer
risk in low-to-moderate drinkers of alcohol. These results
support a role of inﬂammation in mechanisms underlying
established nutrition–cancer relations (29).

To our knowledge, few studies have explored the relations
between the DII and cancer risk. Most of them were non-
prospective case-control studies: 1 showed positive associations
of the DII with pancreatic cancer (15); 2 with prostate cancer, in
line with our results (12, 17); 2 with colorectal cancer (20, 21);
and 2 with esophageal cancer (11, 22). A recent case-control
study in postmenopausal women observed no association
between the DII and breast cancer (13). Only 4 prospective
studies investigated the relations between the DII and cancer
risk: 1 found a direct association with lung cancer risk (14), and
3 found a direct association with colorectal cancer risk (16, 18,
20). All of these studies used an FFQ (11–19, 21, 22) or a dietary
history questionnaire (20), but none used repeated 24-h records
or recalls. To our knowledge, no prospective study has previ-
ously investigated the relation between the DII and overall,
female breast, and prostate cancer risks.

Our analysis resulted in a positive association between the
proinﬂammatory potential of the individual diets assessed with
higher DII scores and increased prostate and,
in low-to-
moderate alcohol drinkers, overall and breast cancer risks.
These associations were statistically signiﬁcant from the Q2 of
the DII compared with Q1, suggesting a threshold effect. These

results are consistent with epidemiologic studies that demon-
strated 1) correlations between the DII and inﬂammatory
biomarkers, and 2) associations between these inﬂammatory
biomarkers and cancer risk. Indeed, the DII has been signif-
icantly and positively associated with several
inﬂammatory
biomarkers, such as IL-6 and CRP (5, 7, 30, 31). Moreover, in a
meta-analysis published in 2013, Guo et al. (3) concluded that
elevated concentrations of CRP were associated with an
increased risk of all cancers, lung cancer, and possibly breast,
prostate, and colorectal cancer. Since then, several prospective
studies corroborated these ﬁndings. We previously showed that
baseline high-sensitivity CRP concentrations were positively
associated with subsequent overall and prostate cancer risk in
the SU.VI.MAX cohort (4). In a nested case-control study from
the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition
cohort, colorectal cancer cases were characterized by a ‘‘reactive
oxygen metabolites and CRP’’ pattern (32), and several inﬂam-
matory biomarkers were associated with elevated endometrial

cancer risk in postmenopausal women (33). Zuo et al. (34) found
that plasma neopterin, kynurenine-to-tryptophan ratio, and CRP
were interrelated and positively associated with overall cancer
risk. Shiels et al. (35) observed a positive association between
inﬂammatory markers and lung cancer risk. However, this point
remains debated because recent studies also reported no associ-
ation between CRP and/or IL-6 and prostate (36) and epithelial
ovarian cancer risk (37).

Experimental evidence strongly supports the involvement of
inﬂammation in carcinogenesis (1, 38–40). Reactive oxygen and
nitrogen intermediates, prostaglandins, and inﬂammatory cyto-
kines were found to be associated with chronic inﬂammation
(39). These molecules are involved in neoplastic tumor processes
through immune responses (1). Genetic polymorphisms in
inﬂammation-related genes [IL1B, IL10, tumor necrosis factor
(TNF), IL6, IL8, and cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2)] and inﬂam-
matory molecules expressed may be implicated in prostate
cancer initiation and progression (38).

Based on the results of numerous experimental and observa-
tional studies (9), alcohol intake contributes to the DII compu-
tation as an anti-inﬂammatory marker. Nevertheless, alcohol
is acknowledged to be a major risk factor in many cancers and
to be involved in several procarcinogenic mechanisms (DNA
damage, generation of reactive oxygen species,
increase in
circulating estrogens, etc.) (29, 41). For these reasons, we tested
the interaction between the DII and alcohol intake, which was
statistically signiﬁcant for overall and breast cancer risk. Thus,
we stratiﬁed our analysis by the sex-speciﬁc median of daily
alcohol intake. A higher DII was associated with increased
overall and breast cancer risk in low-to-moderate drinkers only.
Several hypotheses can be formulated to explain these results.
First, the pro- or anti-inﬂammatory potential of the diet may
inﬂuence cancer risk in low-to-moderate drinkers while being
exceeded by the deleterious effect of alcohol in heavier drinkers.
Second, because of the DII design, higher alcohol intake makes
DII scores lower and may scramble the results because alcohol
simultaneously increases cancer risk. This also may explain the
inverse association between the DII and breast cancer risk

observed in higher alcohol drinkers, which is unlikely to be
causal. Indeed, although analyses were adjusted for alcohol
intake, it may be difﬁcult to disentangle the effect of alcohol. In
addition, in the SU.VI.MAX cohort, we previously showed an
interaction between several classes of polyphenols and alcohol
intake on breast cancer risk (42). Although an inverse associ-
ation was observed between polyphenols and breast cancer risk
in women with an alcohol intake below the median, a direct
association was observed with higher consumption of alcohol.
Because several classes of polyphenols are included in the DII
calculation as anti-inﬂammatory factors,
this adds further
complexity to the association between the DII, alcohol, and
breast cancer risk.

Strengths of our study included its prospective design with
long follow-up and the implementation of a literature-derived
index to assess the overall inﬂammatory potential of the diet. In
addition, usual dietary intake was assessed with a high degree of
accuracy by using repeated 24-h dietary records (with a mean
of 10 records/subject) that accounted for intraindividual day-
to-day and seasonal variability. Nevertheless, some limitations
should be acknowledged. First, the limited number of cases
may have impaired our ability to detect some of the hypothesized
associations. Moreover, speciﬁc cancer sites other than the 2

primarily represented in the cohort (i.e., breast and prostate)
could not be investigated separately. Second, subjects were
volunteers involved in a long-term nutrition study and thus were
more highly educated, less likely to smoke, and more health-
conscious than the general French population. Despite this
healthier proﬁle (low baseline risk), the number of incident
cancers was larger than in the general population. The study
protocol included a yearly check-up that may have encour-
aged early diagnosis (in particular for breast cancer in
women, for whom screening mammograms were performed
during follow-up). Therefore, caution is needed when extrap-
olating these results to the entire French population. Third, all
self-reported cases were validated by an expert committee.
However, it is possible that some individuals with cancer
did not report their cancer events. Next, although most of
the 45 DII variables were taken into account (n = 36), some
items (n = 9) were missing in our database and thus could
not be included, such as caffeine, eugenol, saffron, selenium,
turmeric, zinc,
thyme or oregano, and rosemary (anti-
inﬂammatory factors), and trans FAs (proinﬂammatory fac-
tor). However,
it is unlikely that these missing variables
drastically inﬂuenced the results, because it has been shown
that the ability of the DII to predict inﬂammation remained
the same when the number of food variables was decreased
from 45 to 28 (5). Finally, residual confounders could not be
ruled out. However, a large range of confounding factors was
taken into account, thus limiting potential bias.

To our knowledge, this study was the ﬁrst to investigate the
prospective association between the overall pro- or anti-
inﬂammatory potential of the diet, assessed with the DII, and
overall, female breast, and prostate cancer risk. Consistent with
mechanistic data, our results suggest that a proinﬂammatory
diet may be associated with increased prostate cancer risk. When
models were stratiﬁed by alcohol intake, a major cancer risk
factor, a proinﬂammatory diet also was associated with in-
creased overall and breast cancer risk in low-to-moderate
drinkers. These results provide interesting insights for the
understanding of the relations between diet and cancer risk,
and inﬂammation-based underlying mechanisms. They suggest
that promoting an anti-inﬂammatory dietary pattern may
contribute to cancer prevention.

Abstract 
Accumulating  data  suggest  that  dietary  phytochemicals  have  the  potential  to  moderate 
deregulated  signalling  or  reinstate  checkpoint  pathways  and  apoptosis  in  damaged  cells, 
while  having  minimal  impact  on  healthy  cells.    These  are  ideal  characteristics  for 
chemopreventive  and  combination  anti-cancer  strategies,  warranting  substantial  research 
effort  into  harnessing  the  biological  activities  of  these  agents  in  disease  prevention  and 
treatment.  However, this requires further investigation into their mode of action and novel 
approaches to the development of reliable biomarkers. 
Introduction 
Epidemiology indicates that the incidence of many common cancers is geographically and 
environmentally determined and that diets rich in fresh fruit and vegetables confer a lower 
risk of developing tumours in many target tissues.   Around one third of all cancers are 
thought to be related to unhealthy diet and therefore, in theory, preventable [1]. However, 
linking particular dietary components to prevention of specific cancers has proved to be a 
major challenge.  
Many  phytochemicals  of  differing  chemical  structure  have  anticarcinogenic  properties. 
They  activate  cytoprotective  enzymes  and  inhibit  DNA  damage  to  block  initiation  in 
healthy cells, or modulate cell signalling to eliminate unhealthy cells at later stages in the 
carcinogenic process.  In vitro data for several well-studied compounds indicate that each 
can  affect  many  aspects  of  cell  biochemistry,  but  different  agents  have  many  similar 
activities (Table 1).  Nevertheless effects can be cell-type specific, with transformed cells 
being particularly sensitive.  But despite the exponential increase in knowledge regarding 
mechanisms of action of these molecules, their success in clinical trials has been limited.  
In addition to the difficulties of long-term prevention trials in healthy populations, there are 
other reasons for this.  In cancer therapeutics, emphasis is increasingly placed on targeting 
tumour subtypes within a particular tissue, but this has not generally been considered for 
chemopreventive trials.  In many instances the crucial in vivo targets for particular dietary 
molecules are unknown, making it difficult to predict which cancer phenotypes are most 
likely to be affected.  Many phytochemicals are poorly bioavailable and evidence suggests 
that combinations may be more effective than single agents.  There may also be advantages 
in  combining  them  with  chemo-  or  radio-therapies.    Probably  the  greatest  hindrance  to 
more  successful  trials  is  the  lack  of  validated  biomarkers  of  efficacy.    To  enable  many 
more agents to be tested much more quickly, validated surrogate endpoint biomarkers are

required, which will accurately determine outcome at a much earlier time in the process of 
tumour development.  
Identifying at risk individuals 
In order to optimise the chances of success in cancer chemoprevention trials, the ability to 
identify  those  individuals  most  likely  to  benefit  is  clearly  important  [2].    In  the  case  of 
primary  prevention  to  inhibit  the  earliest  stages  of  tumour  development,  selection  has 
traditionally  been  based  on  known  environmental  and  lifestyle  risk  factors,  genetic 
predisposition and family history.  But with such cohorts, obtaining definitive evidence to 
directly link exposure to a particular dietary agent with prevention of cancer in any target 
tissue is at best extremely challenging, at worst impossible.  In future it is possible that 
individuals suitable for primary prevention will be identified through screening for more 
common multiple susceptibility loci, such as those recently reported for breast cancer [3].   
Such loci together could inform on a substantial fraction of the genetic variance in some 
cancers. 
Patients can be recruited at later stages of the carcinogenic process.  Secondary prevention 
is  appropriate  for  those  who  have  already  developed  premalignant  lesions,  such  as 
intraepithelial  neoplasia  or  intestinal  polyps,  the  progress  of  which  can  be  monitored  in 
response  to  chemopreventive  treatments.    Several  dietary  compounds,  including  indoles 
and  polyphenols  have  shown  promise  in  this  respect,  with  regression  of  respiratory 
papillomatosis, cervical, vulvar and prostate intraepithelial neoplasia and oral leukoplakia 
[4-7].    However,  the  relationship  of  some  of  these  early  lesions  to  tumour  outcome  is 
uncertain.    Clearly  a  strategy  involving  susceptibility  loci  would  also  be  relevant  at  this 
stage, adding a degree of certainty to the prognosis. 
A  third  strategy  is  tertiary  prevention,  which  focuses  on  patients  who  have  been 
successfully  treated  for  a  primary  tumour,  in  order  to  inhibit  development  of  second 
primary tumours.  Greatest success to date in this respect has resulted from the use of drugs 
such as tamoxifen and its analogues for breast cancer, and retinoids for skin, head and neck 
and liver cancer [8].  If phytochemicals have a role at this stage, it is most likely to be as 
part of a combined therapy. 
Arguably a fourth category of patients who could benefit would be those with a superficial 
or  primary  tumour,  where  intervention  is  designed  to  prevent  invasion  and  metastases.  
While the cellular process of epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) is fundamental to 
morphogenesis,  when  reactivated  in  cancer,  it  facilitates  invasion  and  metastasis[9].  
Reversing this process could limit metastatic spread, achieving late-stage prevention with 

 

3

enhanced survival. Ability of chemopreventive agents to inhibit EMT or angiogenesis has 
been demonstrated in a number of animal models.  Use of phytochemicals for this purpose 
would be facilitated by knowledge of the characteristics within the primary tumour which 
predict invasive potential.  We previously showed that the polyphenol, curcumin, modifies 
the invasive potential of breast cancer cells[10].   Another polyphenol, epigallocatechin-3-
gallate  (EGCG),  was  found  to  inhibit  neovascularisation  in  the  chick  chorioallantoic 
membrane assay and when given in drinking water could significantly suppress vascular 
endothelial  growth  factor  (VEGF)-induced  corneal  neovascularisation  [11].  Such  results 
suggest  that  EGCG  may  be  a  useful  inhibitor  of  angiogenesis  in  vivo.    A  number  of 
phytochemicals also affect expression of cadherins, catenins and matrix metalloproteinases 
(Table  1),  and  prognostic  metastatic  biomarkers  for  breast  cancer,  such  as  urokinase 
plasminogen  activator,  uPA/PAI1  and  Her2  [12]  all  of  which  can  modulate  invasive 
capacity.     
Tumour subtypes 
A  key  aspect  of  targeted  therapies,  which  has  so  far  received  much  less  attention  in 
chemoprevention trials, is the concept of tumour subtypes.  Tumour development involves 
the accumulation of multiple mutations which differ from one tumour to the next in the 
same target tissue.  Such changes can be assessed using gene expression profiles to identify 
patterns of pathway deregulation which inform on disease prognosis and indicate treatment 
options [13].  Subtypes are perhaps best defined for the leukaemias [reviewed in 14] and in 
breast cancer, where at least 5 subtypes including luminal A (oestrogen receptor α (ERα)-
positive),  luminal  B  (ERα-positive),  basal-like  (ERα-negative,  Her2-negative,  cytokeratin  5/6-positive, 
and/or epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)/Her1-positive), Her2 (Her2 amplicon-positive, 
ER-negative) and normal breast-like have been identified [15,16]. Such patterns in cancer cell 
lines have also been shown to be useful in predicting response to therapeutic agents [13, 
17,18].    However,  subtypes  identified  on  the  basis  of  gene  expression  profiles  do  not 
correspond  exactly  to  those  identified  by  immunohistochemistry  [19,20]  and  used  in 
clinical practice [21]. 
Additionally, gene signatures which predict the response to individual agents can be used 
in  combination 
  Dietary 
chemopreventive agents certainly exhibit cell-type specificity, but because of their broad 
ranging activity, they may be effective against different tumour subtypes.             Recent 
studies  show  that  indole-3-carbinol  (I3C)  induces  apoptosis  by  decreasing  expression  of 

the  efficacy  of  multidrug  regimes  [22].

genes essential for tumour cell viability, such as ERα and EGFR in breast cells of luminal 
A and basal-like subtypes [23,24] 
Molecular biomarkers 
There is no doubt that identification of reliable molecular markers, such as those in subtype 
molecular signatures, would be extremely advantageous to accurately predict efficacy of 
any intervention. Ideal markers should be indicative of early changes, relate directly to the 
carcinogenic  process  and  where  possible  allow 
invasive  assessment  of 
chemopreventive efficacy [25].  For some approaches, this requires a detailed knowledge 
of  not  only  the  stages  of  carcinogenesis  for  a  particular  tumour  subtype,  but  also  the 
mechanisms of action of the preventive agent.  Molecular biomarkers would be valuable as 
targets  to  identify  new  agents  or  to  optimise  lead  compounds;  as  risk  biomarkers  for 
selecting  suitable  cohorts  for  chemopreventive  trials;  or  as  indicators  of  efficacy  for 
determining response to mechanism-based interventions or identifying potential toxicity.   
There  is  no  shortage  of  candidate  proteins  related  to  oncogenic  processes  (drug 
metabolising  enzymes,  growth  factors,  transcription  factors,  cell  cycle  and  apoptosis 
related proteins) known to be aberrantly expressed in various tumours and modulated by 
phytochemicals in vitro (Table 1).  The philosophy of chemoprevention suggests long-term 
or  life-time  exposure  to  low  doses.    Therefore,  when  selecting  potential  biomarkers  of 
efficacy,  it  is  essential  to  ensure  that  they  are  modulated  under  appropriate  conditions.  
However, many of the in vitro mechanistic studies have been carried out with single high 
doses of chemopreventive agent that are not achievable in vivo.  Thus some of the reported 
effects may not be physiologically relevant. In order to better predict how phytochemicals 
may  act 
  Pharmacokinetic  and 
pharmacodynamic  studies  allow  estimates  of  plasma  and,  in  some  cases  tissue, 
concentrations  to  be  made.    Where  these  already  exist,  they  indicate  that  achievable 
concentrations are in the nanomolar, or at best, low micromolar range. In humans curcumin 
levels  are  typically  in  the  low  nanomolar  range,  although  ~10  μM  can  be  achieved  in 
colorectal tissue.  Resveratrol plasma concentrations of ~2μM appear typical [reviewed in 
26].  These low doses then need to be applied in cell culture studies over extended periods 
to better mimic in vivo exposure.  We exposed the metastatic breast line, MDA-MB231, to 
physiologically achievable concentrations of five agents in long-term culture and observed 
favourable  alterations  to  cell  cycle,  clonogenicity,  apoptosis  and  expression  of  several 
proteins associated with EMT (Moiseeva et al unpublished data).  Encouragingly, quite a 

in  humans,  several  approaches  are 

less 

required.

few  published  studies,  in  which  single  treatments  with  physiological  concentrations  of 
dietary agents have been used in vitro, also reveal significant biological activity [reviewed 
in  26].    Additionally  a  number  of  phytochemical  effects  observed  in  vitro  have  been 
validated in animal models.   
       Monolayer cultures are unrepresentative of in vivo environments, so that models where 
cells  are  grown  on  relevant  substrata  like  collagen,  laminin  or  matrigel,  or  as  3-
dimensional spheroids may be more compatible with in vivo activity.  We found that breast 
cells  responded  differently  to  I3C  under  such  growing  conditions  [27].  In  3D  culture 
(collagen 1 or spheroids) the sensitivity of MCF7 and MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells 
towards I3C was increased.  In MDA-MB-468 cells the expression of the EGFR and β1-
integrin  was  modulated  by  3D  culture,  with  cells  responding  differently  to  EGF  or  the 
EGFR  inhibitor,  PD153035.      Phytochemical  effects  are  often  cell-type  specific  and  so 
different panels of biomarkers may be required for different target tissues, or for different 
cancer  subtypes  within  a  single  tissue.    On  the  other  hand  there  appears  to  be  a  certain 
degree  of  similarity  in  the  protein  targets  affected  by  a  variety  of  structurally  unrelated 
phytochemicals, suggesting similar mechanisms of action (Table 1).  
A  detailed  understanding  of  the  effects  of  dietary  agents  (for  example  on  growth  factor 
signalling,  EMT,  cell  cycle  arrest  and  apoptosis)  following  extended  treatment  at 
physiologically achievable doses, and related to target tissue and cancer subtype, will help 
to  identify  useful  biomarkers.    Such  an  understanding  would  include  identification  of 
primary targets of phytochemicals (particular proteins such as receptors, or more general 
effects such as endoplasmic reticulum stress or altered redox status), an appreciation as to 
why  healthy  cells  are  generally  more  resistant  and  comparison  of  in  vitro  with  in  vivo 
efficacy.   
Cancer-initiating stem cells 
An increasing number of studies are reporting the identification of a subset of cancer stem 
cells within a tumour, which are thought to be responsible for the highly aggressive nature 
of different cancers.  Breast cancer cells, grown in immune compromised mice, contained a 
subpopulation 
antigen 
(ESA)+CD44+CD24-/lowLineage-]. This subset maintained the ability to form new tumours 
[28 Al-Hajj].  Interestingly, the basal-like breast cancer subtype has similarity with breast 
stem  cells  [20,  29],  suggesting  the  “stem-like”  characteristics  of  this  subtype  may  be 
responsible for its aggressiveness and poor prognosis. Using a xenograft model of primary 
human pancreatic adenocarcinoma, Li et al [30] described a subpopulation of cancer cells 

surface  markers

cell 

[epithelial

[expressing CD44, CD24 and ESA] that were 100-fold more tumorigenic than other cells 
from  the  same  tumours.    Similarly  O’Brien  et  al.,  [31]  identified  a  highly  tumorigenic 
subset of colon cancer cells positive for CD133 (1 colon cancer initiating cell per 5.7 x 104 
tumour  cells).    Clearly  if  biomarkers  can  be  used  reliably  to  identify  subsets  of  cancer 
initiating cells, it will be essential to determine the efficacy of treatments against these, in 
preference to other phenotypes within the tumour. 
Dietary agents in combined treatments 
Also of increasing importance is the investigation of combinations of phytochemicals, or 
their  use  in  conjunction  with  other  therapies,  to  increase  efficacy  or  decrease  unwanted 
side  effects  [26,  32].      We  have  shown  in  breast  cell  lines  that  I3C  exhibits  enhanced 
efficacy in combination with src or EGFR kinase inhibitors [24] and in vivo I3C prevented 
the  hepatotoxicity  of  trabectidin  (ET743),  an  experimental  anti-tumour  drug  with 
promising activity in sarcoma, breast and ovarian carcinomas, without compromising anti-
tumour efficacy [33].  Curcumin enhances the efficacy of oxaliplatin in both p53-positive and 
p53mutant  colon  cancer  cells  [34].    However,  caution  is  required,  since  it  has  also  been 
reported  to  compromise  the  efficacy  of  some  chemotherapeutic  drugs  in  human  breast 
cancer models [35]. 
Proteomics 
Methods which do not require a detailed knowledge of mechanisms, initially at least, offer 
an alternative approach to developing biomarkers and assessing chemopreventive efficacy. 
Mass  spectrometry  of  biological  samples  offers  a  powerful  proteomic  tool  for  the 
discovery  of  novel  biomarkers  and  for  profiling  [36].    Proteins  and  peptides  in  clinical 
samples reflect the intracellular activities of healthy and diseased tissue.  Plasma samples 
subjected to mass spectrometry can provide characteristic protein profiles, when over- and 
under-expressed peptides are determined by pattern comparison using a variety of machine 
learning  algorithms  [37-39].  This  technique  should  offer  the  possibility  of  monitoring 
plasma  profiles  in  at  risk  individuals  in  response  to  a  particular  treatment  regime.   
Development of these methods for cultured cells, would also provide the means to screen 
effects of chemopreventive agents – for example, to estimate the lowest concentration of 
agent  that  causes  a  change  in  profile;  to  look  for  dose-response  in  altered  peaks;  to 
compare  effects  of  one  agent  in  different  cell  types;  to  compare  the  signatures  between 
compounds  in  the  same  cell  type;  and  to  enable  identification  of  signature  peaks. 
Individual  proteins  can  be  identified  by  correlating  the  sequences  of  tryptic  peptides 
generated  by  tandem  mass  spectrometry  (MS/MS)  with  sequences  in  protein  databases. 

 

7

The  evolutionary  algorithms  with  support  vector  machine  (SVM)  supervised  learning 
enable  identification  of  biomarkers  with  the  highest  diagnostic  and  prognostic  potential. 
The effectiveness of combined treatments could also be explored. Nuclear fractions could 
provide enrichment for investigating changes in transcription factors and cell cycle-related 
proteins.    In  view  of  the  importance  of  protein  phosphorylation  in  proliferation, 
differentiation  and  apoptosis,  development  of  techniques  selective  for  phosphopeptides 
would provide added value [40, 41]. 
Conclusions 
In order to fully appreciate the potential for dietary compounds in cancer prevention and 
bridge the gap between apparent in vitro efficacy and clinical use, a number of  approaches 
are required.  Attention must be paid to the use of physiologically relevant concentrations, 
to  chronic  exposure  and  to  3D  cultures,  to  more  accurately  mimic  in  vivo  situations.  
Validation of potential mechanisms in appropriate animal models is also important.  The 
mechanistic biomarkers identified in vitro need to be verified in human tissues as being 
central  to  the  carcinogenic  process.    Finally  genomics  and  proteomics  approaches  offer 
novel ways of predicting clinical efficacy.

Background.

Abstract
Lung  cancer  and  cardiovas-
cular  disease  are  major  causes  of  death  in  the  United
States.  It  has  been  proposed  that  carotenoids  and  reti-
noids are agents that may prevent these disorders.

Methods.

We  conducted  a  multicenter,  randomized,
double-blind, placebo-controlled primary prevention trial
— the Beta-Carotene and Retinol Efﬁcacy Trial — involv-
ing a total of 18,314 smokers, former smokers, and work-
ers exposed to asbestos. The effects of a combination of
30 mg of beta carotene per day and 25,000 IU of retinol
(vitamin A) in the form of retinyl palmitate per day on the
primary  end  point,  the  incidence  of  lung  cancer,  were
compared with those of placebo.

Results.

A  total  of  388  new  cases  of  lung  cancer
were diagnosed during the 73,135 person-years of follow-
up (mean length of follow-up, 4.0 years). The active-treat-
ment group had a relative risk of lung cancer of 1.28 (95
percent  conﬁdence  interval,  1.04  to  1.57;  P
0.02),  as

UNG cancer is the leading cause of death from can-
cer  in  the  United  States,  accounting  for  approxi-
mately 29 percent of deaths from cancer and 6 percent
of all deaths.
New approaches are essential to prevent
1 
lung cancer in persons who have smoked cigarettes or
who have had occupational exposure to asbestos. Twen-
ty-nine percent of men and 25 percent of women who
 and at least
are 45 to 64 years of age currently smoke,
40 percent of men and 20 percent of women in this age
group are former smokers.
 An estimated 4000 to 6000
3
deaths from lung cancer per year are attributed to ex-
posure to asbestos.

On the basis of epidemiologic observations and lab-
oratory  studies,  beta  carotene  and  vitamin  A  have  at-
tracted  wide  interest  as  agents  that  may  prevent  lung
cancer.
 The Beta-Carotene and Retinol Efﬁcacy Trial
(CARET)  is  one  of  several  recent  trials  to  assess  the

compared with the placebo group. There were no statis-
tically signiﬁcant differences in the risks of other types of
cancer. In the active-treatment group, the relative risk of
death  from  any  cause  was  1.17  (95  percent  conﬁdence
interval, 1.03 to 1.33); of death from lung cancer, 1.46 (95
percent  conﬁdence  interval,  1.07  to  2.00);  and  of  death
from cardiovascular disease, 1.26 (95 percent conﬁdence
interval, 0.99 to 1.61). On the basis of these ﬁndings, the
randomized  trial  was  stopped  21  months  earlier  than
planned; follow-up will continue for another 5 years.

Conclusions.

After  an  average  of  four  years  of  sup-
plementation, the combination of beta carotene and vita-
min A had no beneﬁt and may have had an adverse effect
on the incidence of lung cancer and on the risk of death
from lung cancer, cardiovascular disease, and any cause
in smokers and workers exposed to asbestos. (N  Engl J

Study Design

9,14-16

The  study’s  strategy,  design,  detailed  methods,  eligibility,  pilot-
study ﬁndings, and recruitment information have been published else-
where.
  Brieﬂy,  CARET  was  organized  in  1983  and  began  ran-
domization in Seattle in 1985 in two pilot studies: one enrolled 816
men  with  substantial  occupational  exposure  to  asbestos,  who  were
randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either a combination of
15 mg of beta carotene per day and 25,000 IU of retinol per day (ac-
tive treatment) or placebo; the second enrolled 1029 men and women
with extensive histories of cigarette smoking, to receive 30 mg of beta
carotene per day, 25,000 IU of retinol per day, both vitamins, or nei-
ther vitamin (two-by-two design). The trial was expanded to include
additional study centers in 1988 and 1991, and all subjects were ran-
domly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either active treatment or placebo.
The  pilot  groups  receiving  active  agents  were  consolidated  in  1988
into a single group receiving a standard daily regimen of 30 mg of
beta carotene plus 25,000 IU of retinol in the form of retinyl palmi-
tate. Thus, in the pilot study with the cohort of smokers, three sub-
jects were assigned to active treatment for every subject assigned to
placebo; therefore, the rates rather than numbers of end points must
 called
be compared between active and placebo groups. The design

for active intervention until late 1997 (110,000 person-years), with re-
porting of results in 1998.

cruitment. To be eligible for the study the subjects had to have ﬁrst
been exposed to asbestos on the job 15 years before randomization,
and either have had a chest x-ray ﬁlm positive for asbestos-related
lung  disease  or  have  worked  in  speciﬁed  high-risk  trades  —  as
plumbers and pipe ﬁtters, steamﬁtters, shipyard boilermakers, non-
shipyard boilermakers, shipyard electricians, ship scalers, insulators,
plasterboard workers, or sheet-metal workers — for 5 years. The as-
; subse-
bestos pilot study had no requirements regarding smoking
quently,  subjects  were  required  to  be  current  smokers  or  to  have
smoked within the previous 15 years. For the population of smokers,
women  and  men  were  recruited  from  health  insurance  rolls  and
managed-care organizations if they were 50 to 69 years of age, had
at least 20 pack-years of cigarette smoking, and either were currently
smoking or had quit smoking within the previous six years. The par-
ticipants agreed to limit their supplemental intake of vitamin A to
less than 5500 IU per day and to take no supplemental beta caro-
tene. A total of 4060 workers exposed to asbestos and 14,254 heavy
smokers (44 percent of whom were women) were randomized. We
provided detailed information for informed consent at recruitment
and  regularly  thereafter,  including  a  letter  to  each  participant  de-
scribing  the  results  of  the  1994  Alpha-Tocopherol,  Beta  Carotene
Cancer Prevention Study (ATBC).

Active  agents  and  placebos  were  purchased  from  Hoffmann–
LaRoche and formulated by Tishcon Corporation. Both formulations
were given as capsules. Beta carotene beadlets were combined with
retinyl palmitate in a single capsule and dispensed in bottles, which
were weighed and their contents checked. We assessed the subjects’
compliance by weighing the returned bottles to estimate the number
of capsules remaining (in 85 percent of the assessments) or by relying
on the subjects’ own estimates (15 percent). Blood was collected an-
nually from the original pilot participants and every two years from
the other participants.

Subjects who stopped receiving study vitamins for any reason other
than  death  were  deﬁned  as  inactive  participants  and  were  still  fol-
lowed for end points and counted in the analyses.

Data Collection and Monitoring of Safety

and End Points
Each year active participants visited a study center once and were
telephoned  twice,  at  four-month  intervals.  Inactive  participants
were telephoned semiannually. Over 97 percent of scheduled contacts
were completed. As of December 15, 1995, ascertainment of vital sta-
tus was more than 98 percent complete.

Symptoms and signs and newly diagnosed medical conditions were
monitored  closely  by  questionnaire  at  all  contacts  and  in  limited
physical  examinations  during  study-center  visits;  laboratory  values
for  liver  function  and  serum  analytes  were  monitored  annually  in
participants  randomized  in  the  pilot  studies  (for  use  in  adjusting
estimates of relative risk with the case–cohort approach).
 The 13
17
monitored symptoms were graded according to the CARET symp-
tom-assessment scale.
 An independent safety and end-points mon-
16
itoring  committee  met  semiannually  to  review  in  blinded  fashion
data  coded  according to intervention group. When the results of the
ATBC Cancer Prevention trial
 became available, the committee re-
viewed the results of the ﬁrst interim analysis and requested that the
blinding  be  ended.  Subsequently,  the  committee  reviewed  data  un-
blinded.

10

Ascertainment and Evaluation of End Points

All  initial  reports  of  cancers  and  deaths  from  each  study  center
were submitted to the coordinating center and entered into a tracking
system. Participants and all study staff members involved in the as-
certainment and evaluation of end points and assignment of ﬁnal di-
agnoses remained unaware of the participants’ treatment assignment
throughout the trial. Clinical records and, for tumors involving the
lung, pathology specimens were obtained for independent review by
the end-points review committee, composed of two oncologists, two
internists, and a pathologist. An end point was considered conﬁrmed
when the end-point review process was completed. Through Decem-
ber 15, 1995, a total of 2420 end points had been reported: 1446 can-
cers (in 1353 participants) and 974 deaths. Of the initial reports of

lung cancer for which the end-point–review process was completed,
90 percent were conﬁrmed; most of the remainder were found to be
metastases and recurrences.

Statistical Analysis

The primary analysis, based on the intention to treat, was designed
to test for differences between treatment groups in the incidence of
lung cancer with a weighted log-rank statistic stratiﬁed according to
the risk group (workers exposed to asbestos or heavy smokers), time
of recruitment (pilot study or subsequent period), and study center
(six centers).
 Parameter estimates and the results of statistical tests
14
were similar with and without the weighting; we present here the un-
weighted results. Estimates of relative risk and conﬁdence intervals
were obtained from stratiﬁed Cox regression models with the same
strata  as  the  log-rank  statistics.  The  cumulative  incidence  of  end
⁄
points was plotted through 5
 years of follow-up because of the small
1
2
number  of  participants  beyond  that  time  and  involved  354  partici-
pants with new cases of lung cancer, 829 deaths, and 67,449 person-
years of follow-up. Follow-up for all participants began at randomi-
zation.

The prespeciﬁed monitoring policy for stopping the trial early be-
cause of a beneﬁt or adverse effect of the study vitamins was based
on O’Brien–Fleming boundaries
 applied to the weighted number of
18
conﬁrmed lung-cancer end points, the primary end point. The critical
P values were those of 0.0006 or lower for the ﬁrst interim analysis
in 1994 and those of 0.007 or lower for the second interim analysis in
1995. Results are based on active intervention through December 15,
1995, at which time the 18,314 participants had accumulated 73,135
person-years of follow-up (mean, 4.0 years; median, 3.7).

ESULTS

Characteristics of the Participants

The two randomized groups were well matched, with
a high-risk proﬁle for lung cancer and cardiovascular
disease in both the smokers and the workers exposed
to asbestos (Table 1). All smokers were encouraged and
assisted, if willing, to stop smoking, and all former smok-
ers  were  encouraged  to  maintain  that  status.  Among
current smokers, there was a net smoking-cessation rate
of 5 percent per year.

Through  December  15,  1995,  15  percent  of  the
workers exposed to asbestos who were assigned to ac-
tive  treatment  became  inactive  participants,  as  com-
pared  with  14  percent  of  those  assigned  to  placebo.
The  respective  values  in  the  group  of  heavy  smokers
were 20 percent and 19 percent. Among the active par-
ticipants, the mean rates of capsule consumption were
93 percent through ﬁve years of follow-up, with no sig-
niﬁcant  differences  between  treatment  groups.  The
percentage of participants who took non–study-relat-
ed  supplemental  beta  carotene  or  vitamin  A  in  doses
of more than 5500 IU per day was low (2 percent and
1 percent, respectively). After ﬁve years of study sup-
plementation, the median serum beta carotene concen-
tration in the active-treatment group was 2100 ng per
milliliter, as compared with 170 ng per milliliter in the
placebo group; serum retinol levels were about 10 per-

agnosed conditions.

Incidence of Lung Cancer

The  incidence  of  lung  cancer  was  the  primary  end
point. Through December 15, 1995, 388 participants —
2 percent of the total — were reported to have new cas-
es  of  lung  cancer  (5.4  per  1000  person-years).  In  the
case of 286, the end points were conﬁrmed, whereas in
the case of 102, further review by the end-points com-
mittee was pending. Among the 388, 254 had died. Five
participants  had  two  primary  lung  cancers  each.  The
388 participants represent 79 percent of the 490 partic-
ipants  projected  in  our  statistical  design  to  have  lung
cancer by the end of the intervention. The 73,135 per-
son-years  of  follow-up  accrued  correspond  to  66  per-
cent of the total of 110,000 person-years projected.
14

The active-treatment group had a relative risk of lung
cancer  of  1.28  (95  percent  conﬁdence  interval,  1.04  to
1.57;  P
0.02),  as  compared  with  the  placebo  group
(Table 2). This result includes relative risks of 1.40 (95
percent conﬁdence interval, 0.95 to 2.07) for workers ex-
posed to asbestos, 1.42 (95 percent conﬁdence interval,
1.07 to 1.87) for heavy smokers who were smoking at the
time of randomization, and 0.80 (95 percent conﬁdence

no  statistical  evidence  of  heterogeneity  of  the  relative

lative incidence of lung cancer after randomization; the
incidence  in  the  active-treatment  and  placebo  groups
was virtually identical for the ﬁrst 18 months. There was

of survival after diagnosis of lung cancer in the active-
treatment group as compared with the placebo group,
1.05; 95 percent conﬁdence interval, 0.80 to 1.37).

Incidence of Other Cancers

Active  treatment  had  no  statistically  signiﬁcant  ef-
fect on the risk of mesothelioma. There were 23 cases:
14 in the active-treatment group and 9 in the placebo
group.  The  remaining  1030  new  cases  of  cancer  (in-
cluding the 300 prostate cancers, the second most com-
mon cancer in this population) were distributed nearly
evenly between the two treatment groups.

Mortality Rates

⫽

⫽

As shown in Table 2 and Figure 2, the mortality rate
was  17  percent  higher  in  the  active-treatment  group
than in the placebo group (P
0.02). Among the pop-
ulation of heavy smokers, the relative risk was not sig-
niﬁcantly different between those who were smoking at
the time of randomization and those who were no long-
er smoking at that time (relative risk, 1.15 vs. 1.06).

Analysis according to the cause of death (conﬁrmed
causes  only;  n
764)  showed  that  in  the  active-treat-
ment group, as compared with the placebo group, the
relative risk of death from any cause was 1.18 (95 per-
cent conﬁdence interval, 1.02 to 1.37); of death from lung
cancer, 1.46 (95 percent conﬁdence interval, 1.07 to 2.00);

the large advantages inferred from observational epide-

of dietary intake of fruits and vegetables or of dietary in-

With 73,135 person-years of follow-up, the active-treat-
ment group had a 28 percent higher incidence of lung
cancer than the placebo group, and the overall mortality
rate  and  the  rate  of  death  from  cardiovascular  causes
were higher by 17 percent and 26 percent, respectively.
These  results  conﬁrm  and  extend  the  unexpected
results reported for beta carotene in the ATBC Cancer
Prevention  Study  in  Finland.
  We  cannot  distinguish
10
the  effects  of  beta  carotene  from  those  of  vitamin  A,
since the two agents were administered in combination,
under the hypothesis that they might have a favorable
effect through complementary molecular actions.
9

The second interim analysis led our safety and end-
points monitoring committee and steering committee to
recognize the extremely limited prospect of a favorable
overall effect, as well as the possibility of true adverse
effects. The decision to stop the intervention was made
by the steering committee on January 11, 1996. It is pos-
sible that the excess mortality in the active-treatment
group may have vanished or become statistically insig-
niﬁcant  with  completion  of  the  intended  intervention
period plus several years of follow-up; such reversals of
ﬁndings  have  occurred  both  in  the  course  of  a  single
 and in subsequent random-
large, randomized trial
ized  trials  of  the  same  agent  or  class  of  agents.
23-25
However, it was impossible to ignore the results of the
ATBC Cancer Prevention Study
 in deciding whether
10
to stop the active-intervention phase.

We have no explanation for the possible adverse as-
sociations that we have observed to date. There was no
evidence of systemic toxicity in any organ from the vi-
tamin A or, except for the expected skin yellowing, the
beta carotene. The regimen did not produce clinically
important  hypertriglyceridemia.
  We  considered  con-
tinuing the trial with the retinyl palmitate alone; how-
ever, the need to rerandomize, the extended follow-up
required, and the uncertainty about the involvement of
the vitamin A made this plan infeasible.

In this trial, beta carotene treatment raised the me-
dian serum beta carotene levels to 12 times the base-
line levels and the placebo group’s median values. Such
levels may conceivably be toxic or at least cause serious
disequilibrium with other compounds important to re-
dox relations or other cellular mechanisms. Beta caro-
tene has been postulated to have a pro-oxidant effect
under certain nonphysiologic conditions.
 One study
reported that the administration of beta carotene dras-
tically  lowered  vitamin  E  levels,
  and  three
 have found no such effect. In prelim-
other groups
inary analyses of serum beta carotene levels during ac-
tive treatment, we could ﬁnd no support for the hypoth-
esis that subjects with the highest serum levels of beta
carotene were at greater risk for lung cancer or death
from cardiovascular causes, cancer, or any cause.

ceiving Placebo.

the widely accepted conclusion drawn from observation-
al epidemiologic studies that beta carotene is a primary
component responsible for the association of lower risks
of  cancer  and  death  from  cardiovascular  causes  with
high  intakes  of  fruits  and  vegetables.19,33  Such  studies
typically  compare  extreme  subgroups  for  such  dietary
features,  ignoring  or  only  crudely  adjusting  for  many
other potentially relevant variables, such as the intake of
red meat, physical activity, life situations, and other be-
havior.20 The dietary associations seemed well matched
to serum beta carotene measurements; as in other obser-
vational analyses, in our study base-line serum beta car-
otene  levels  were  inversely  correlated  with  the  subse-
quent incidence of lung cancer in both groups. However,
randomized prevention trials are needed to test the hy-
pothesis that increased beta carotene intake can be pro-
tective.

The results of four large-scale chemoprevention tri-
als of beta carotene and related agents can be summa-
rized. The ATBC Cancer Prevention Study10 tested dai-
ly supplementation with 20 mg of beta carotene and 50
mg of alpha-tocopherol (two-by-two factorial design) in
29,133  male  smokers.  The  Physicians’  Health  Study11
tested supplementation with 50 mg of beta carotene on
alternate days in 22,071 male physicians, 50 percent of
whom  had  never  smoked,  39  percent  of  whom  were
former smokers, and 11 percent of whom were currently
smoking. We tested daily supplementation with a com-
bination of 30 mg of beta carotene and 25,000 IU of ret-
inyl  palmitate.  Finally,  a  study  conducted  in  Linxian,
China,34  assessed  the  value  of  daily  supplementation
with a combination of 15 mg of beta carotene, 50 mg of
selenium, and 30 mg of alpha-tocopherol as compared
with three other combinations of vitamins and minerals
in a complex factorial design in 29,584 adults presumed

to be vitamin- and mineral-deﬁcient — a very different
population from those examined in the other studies. In
the ATBC Cancer Prevention Study, 876 new cases of
lung cancer were diagnosed, yielding a relative risk of
lung cancer of 1.18 among subjects who received beta
carotene  (with  or  without  alpha-tocopherol),  as  com-
pared with those who did not. In the Physicians’ Health
Study, 170 new cases of lung cancer were diagnosed, for
a relative risk of lung cancer of 0.93 among men taking
beta  carotene,  as  compared  with  those  who  received
placebo. In our study, there were 388 new cases of lung
cancer,  yielding  a  relative  risk  of  such  cancer  of  1.28
among the subjects who received beta carotene and ret-
inyl  palmitate,  as  compared  with  those  who  received
placebo.  The  Linxian  study  did  not  report  the  inci-
dence of lung cancer. Among the subjects who received
beta carotene, the relative risk of death from any cause
was  1.08  in  the  ATBC  Cancer Prevention Study  (3570
deaths),  1.01  in  the  Physicians’  Health  Study  (1947
deaths), 1.17 in our trial (974 deaths), and 0.91 in the
Linxian study (2127 deaths).

Reversing or overcoming lifelong metabolic or exog-
enous risk factors may require 5 to 10 years or more to
account for the latent periods of cancers. Favorable ef-
fects may be particularly difﬁcult to achieve in the face
of a continuing carcinogenic and atherogenic assault in
smokers;  alternatively,  antioxidants  and  antiprolifera-
tive  agents  might  act  on  the  constituents  of  cigarette
smoke. Long-term follow-up both during and after ac-
tive treatment with potential chemopreventive agents is
essential if we are to have any hope of observing long-
term  beneﬁts  and  evaluating  long-term  risks.  During
the postintervention follow-up of our study subjects, as
end points continue to accrue, we will conduct labora-
tory analyses and analyze various subgroups, particu-
larly former smokers.

Our ﬁndings provide important new information with
respect to public policy and public health. When these
results are combined with those from the ATBC Cancer
Prevention Study10 and the Physicians’ Health Study,11
they make it clear that there can be little enthusiasm
about the efﬁcacy or safety of supplemental beta caro-
tene  or  vitamin  A  in  efforts  to  reduce  the  burdens  of
cancer or heart disease in certain populations. Howev-
er, we still recommend the dietary intake of fruits and
vegetables.

Other agents that prevent lung cancer and coronary
heart disease must be identiﬁed and subjected to rig-
orous  trials  of  safety  and  efﬁcacy.  Meanwhile,  to  re-
duce the risk of these diseases we must rely primarily
on three approaches: smoking cessation, prevention of
smoking, and avoidance of occupational and environ-
mental exposure to carcinogenic substances.

We are indebted to the study subjects, staff members, and investi-
gators; to the members of the safety and end-points monitoring com-
mittee  over  the  past  several  years  (Anthony  Miller,  Robert  Bruce,
Julie Buring, Frank Iber, and O. Dale Williams); and to our colleagues
who provided data from the Physicians’ Health Study.

Abstract

Background: Diet is known to inﬂuence systemic inﬂammation, a recognized risk factor for colorectal cancer (CRC).

Studies in ethnically diverse populations that examine the association between dietary inﬂammatory potential and CRC

incidence are limited.

Objectives: We used the Dietary Inﬂammatory Index to clarify the relation between the inﬂammatory potential of diet and

CRC incidence across racial/ethnic groups. We hypothesized that proinﬂammatory diets would be associated with an

increased risk of CRC, and that these associations may differ across racial/ethnic groups.

Methods: The Multiethnic Cohort (MEC) follows a prospective study design. It includes 190,963 white, African-American,

native Hawaiian, Japanese-American, and Latino men and women aged 45–75 y at recruitment and followed over 20 y.

Participants completed a food frequency questionnaire from which energy-adjusted Dietary Inﬂammatory Index (E-DII) scores

were computed and categorized into quartiles. CRC incidence was documented through linkage to cancer registry programs.

Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate HRs and 95% CIs, adjusting for known or expected CRC risk factors.

Results: Among all participants, more-proinﬂammatory diets (highest quartile compared with lowest quartile) were

associated with an increased risk of CRC (HR: 1.21; 95% CI: 1.11, 1.32). However, the effect size was larger for men

(HR: 1.28; 95% CI: 1.13, 1.45) than for women (HR: 1.16; 95% CI: 1.02, 1.33), although the interaction term for sex was not
statistically signiﬁcant (P-interaction = 0.17). When stratiﬁed by race/ethnicity, the association was signiﬁcantly different
between groups for men (P-interaction = 0.01), although not for women (P-interaction = 0.20). Signiﬁcant associations with

HRs ranging from 2.33 to 1.04 were observed in white, Japanese-American, and Latino men, and native Hawaiian women.

Conclusions: Overall, more-proinﬂammatory diets, as identiﬁed by the E-DII, were associated with increased CRC risk in

MEC participants across racial/ethnic groups. This study adds to the evidence suggesting that diets with high proinﬂammatory
potential may increase CRC risk. J Nutr 2017;147:430–8.

Introduction

Colorectal cancer (CRC)9 is the third most commonly diagnosed
cancer in the United States (1–3). A number of risk factors have
been described for CRC,
including family history, obesity,
excessive alcohol consumption, tobacco use, low intake of dietary
ﬁber or calcium, high red or processed meat intake, physical
inactivity, and chronic inﬂammation (3). In recent decades,
research on the biological link between chronic inﬂammation,
diet, and CRC incidence has grown (4–6).

Inﬂammation represents a naturally occurring acute immune
response that aids the body in healing wounds and ﬁghting
infection (7, 8). Although acute inﬂammation is consistent with

good health, chronic inﬂammation is implicated in the onset and
progression of cancer (9–11), with evidence of this effect being
strongest for CRC (5). Epidemiologic evidence shows that the
incidence of CRC is higher in individuals with inﬂammatory
bowel disease (5, 12), whereas prolonged use of nonsteroidal
anti-inﬂammatory drugs is shown to reduce risk (13).

Diet is an acknowledged set of CRC risk factors (14) in part
because of its role in regulating inﬂammation (15). Diets rich in
fruits and vegetables are associated with a reduction in CRC risk
(16); whereas diets high in fat, added sugar, and protein are
associated with increased inﬂammation (17, 18) and increased
risk of CRC (16). Although research shows links between diet

and inﬂammation (17, 18), and between chronic inﬂammation
and the development of cancer (4, 19), the complexity of these
relations is not yet fully understood. Dietary pattern analyses
based on the recently developed Dietary Inﬂammatory Index
(DII) may help clarify the relation between the overall inﬂam-
matory potential of individual diets and CRC incidence (20, 21).
The DII distinguishes dietary patterns on a continuum from
anti-inﬂammatory to proinﬂammatory, where a higher, more
positive DII score indicates a more proinﬂammatory diet and a
lower, more negative score indicates a more anti-inﬂammatory
diet (21). Higher DII scores have been linked to both inﬂammatory
biomarkers (22–24) and a greater risk of CRC (25–29). To date,
most DII research has been applied in examinations of primarily
European and European-American populations (23, 25, 26, 28).
Associations between diet and disease incidence are known to
vary across diverse populations (30, 31). Also, major dietary
exposures are known to differ between racial and ethnic groups
(32). However, with respect to the incidence of CRC, little work
has been done to understand the role of proinﬂammatory diets in
nonwhite populations. Therefore, this study used the DII to
examine the relation between the inﬂammatory potential of
dietary intake and CRC incidence within the Multiethnic Cohort
(MEC), which consists of a large (>215,000 participants), racially
and ethnically diverse population that has been followed for >20 y.
We hypothesized that participants with more-proinﬂammatory
diets (i.e., higher DII scores) would have a greater risk of CRC and
that these associations may differ across the racial/ethnic groups
represented in the MEC (African-American, Japanese-American,
Latino, native Hawaiian, and white participants).

Methods

Study population. The MEC is a prospective cohort study investigating
the association of lifestyle and genetic factors with the incidence of
cancer and other diseases. The studyÕs design and implementation have
been described previously (33). Brieﬂy, 215,000 men and women living
in Hawaii or the Los Angeles area and 45–75 y old at recruitment were
enrolled from 1993 to 1996. To obtain a multiethnic sample of African-
American, Japanese-American, Latino, native Hawaiian, and white
participants, driverÕs license ﬁles, voter registration lists, and Medicare
ﬁles were used to identify potential participants. The institutional review
boards at the University of Hawaii and the University of Southern
California approved the study protocol.

Colon and rectal cancer cases were identiﬁed through regular
linkages with the Los Angeles County Cancer Surveillance Program,
the State of California Cancer Registry, and the statewide Hawaii Tumor
the National Cancer InstituteÕs Surveillance,
Registry, all part of
Epidemiology, and End Results program. Migration to other states has
been low in the MEC (7% at 10 y); therefore, Hawaii and California
tumor registries cover the vast majority of incident cases, and this has
been veriﬁed through Medicare linkage. Dates of death were identiﬁed
by routine linkages with California and Hawaii vital records and the
National Death Index databases. Complete case and/or death ascertain-
ment was available up to 31 December 2010. Participants who identiﬁed
as not being a member of 1 of the 5 major racial/ethnic groups (n = 13,988),
who had a prevalent diagnosis of CRC at cohort entry either by self-report
or registry information (n = 2564), or who had implausible dietary data
(n = 8137) were excluded from this analysis. This left a remaining
population of 190,963, with 4388 invasive colorectal adenocarcinoma
cases (3372 colon, 981 rectum, and 35 with both colon and rectum) being
identiﬁed. The 297 incident CRC cases with other histologies were censored
at their date of diagnosis.

Data collection. Upon entry into the cohort, participants completed a 26-
page baseline questionnaire. The questionnaire included questions on
demographics, height and weight, personal and family medical history,
family history of CRC, and physical activity, and a quantitative FFQ with
>180 items, which has been described previously (33–35). The FFQ
assessed usual intake over the previous year with the use of 8 response
categories (‘‘never or hardly ever’’ to ‘‘2 or more times a day’’), and, for
some beverage items, 9 response categories (‘‘never or hardly ever’’ to ‘‘4 or
more times a day’’). Three portion sizes speciﬁc to each food item, shown
as representative images, were used to assess quantity of food eaten. The
FFQ was validated and calibrated in each race/ethnicity–sex group with
the use of data from 1606 participants and 3 randomly scheduled 24-h
dietary recalls (34). The MEC FFQ had several unique attributes, including
the presence of ethnic-speciﬁc foods, reliance on a food composition table
speciﬁc to the MEC, and use of a large recipe database (36).

DII. The development and construct validation of the DII have been
described previously (21, 22). Brieﬂy, nearly 2000 peer-reviewed articles
published through 2010 on the association between diet and 6 inﬂamma-
tory markers (i.e., C-reactive protein, IL-1b, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-a)
were reviewed and scored to determine an inﬂammatory effect score. In
this process, 45 food components were identiﬁed as having a sufﬁciently
robust literature linking to $1 of the 6 markers. Not all of the 45 food
components were available in the MEC data. Food components included
in the DII calculation in the MEC were carbohydrate; protein; total fat;
saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated fats; v-3 and v-6 FAs;
alcohol; ﬁber; cholesterol; vitamins A, B-6, B-12, C, D, and E; thiamin;
riboﬂavin; niacin; iron; magnesium; zinc; selenium; folate; b-carotene;
isoﬂavones; and caffeine. Food components not included were eugenol,
garlic, ginger, onion, trans fat, turmeric, green tea, black tea, falan-3-ol,
ﬂavones, ﬂavonols, ﬂavonones, anthocyanins, pepper, thyme, oregano,
and rosemary. Unavailable food components were dropped from the DII
calculation for the MEC. Only intake from foods, and not from
supplements, was used in the DII calculations.

The DII was standardized to its current range with the use of dietary
intake from surveys or studies in 11 countries, which were compiled to
provide a reference mean 6 SD intake value for each food component
(21). A z score was created for each food component for each participant
by subtracting the reference mean from the actual food component
intake value and then dividing the difference by the reference SD. To
minimize the effect of right skewing and to center the distribution on 0
(null), with a lower bound of 21 (maximally anti-inﬂammatory) and
upper bound of +1 (maximally proinﬂammatory), these z scores were
then converted to a centered proportion score. This was achieved by
doubling the z score expressed on a scale of 0 to 1 and then subtracting 1.
The product of each food component–speciﬁc centered proportion score
and inﬂammatory effect score was calculated and summed for all food
components, which created the overall DII score. DII calculations are
based on the intake of each food component as expressed per 1000 kcal
consumed, also known as the energy-adjusted Dietary Inﬂammatory

Index (E-DII) (37–40). A higher DII score indicates a more proin-
ﬂammatory diet and a lower score indicates a more anti-inﬂammatory
diet. The E-DII scores within the MEC were converted to quartiles with
the following ranges: quartile 1 = 26.64 to 23.66; quartile 2 = 23.65 to
22.32; quartile 3 = 22.31 to 20.53; and quartile 4 = 20.52 to 4.95.
Although the range of scores for the E-DII may be similar to the DII
scores in the literature (39), they cannot be compared directly, because
the E-DII scores take into account nutrient density of the diet.

Statistical analysis. Analyses were performed with the use of SAS
version 9.4. Frequencies or means 6 SDs were calculated for participant
characteristics at baseline. Variables investigated as possible confounders
included previous disease diagnoses (i.e., heart attack, diabetes, hyper-
tension, and others), use of dietary supplements, smoking status, year of
enrollment, family history of CRC, hormone use (i.e., estrogen or
progesterone), aspirin use, average sleep duration, physical activity (in
metabolic equivalents), location (i.e., Hawaii or Los Angeles), marital status,
education, age at cohort entry, and BMI (kg/m2). The categories used in
modeling are the same as those given in Table 1.

Sex and race/ethnicity were investigated for their role as effect modiﬁers.
Minimally adjusted models were computed with the use of age, sex, and
race as STRATA variables. Model confounder selection was determined
with a series of bivariable Cox proportional hazards regressions (i.e., the
E-DII + potential covariate). All covariates with a P value # 0.20, along
with the E-DII score, were included in a saturated adjustment model. A ﬁnal
adjustment model was created by including only covariates that, when
removed, led to a $10% change in the HR of the E-DII and those that
were statistically signiﬁcant (P < 0.05) in the saturated model. However,
hormone use (for women) and aspirin use were retained in the model
regardless of signiﬁcance because of their direct impact on inﬂammation
(13, 41). See footnotes of tables for ﬁnal model speciﬁcations.

To examine the relation between the E-DII scores and CRC
incidence, Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate
HRs and 95% CIs. Time (in years) elapsed since study entry was used as
the time metric. The referent category was the lowest quartile (quartile 1)
for E-DII, with the primary comparison of interest being between
quartile 4 and quartile 1. The assumption of proportional hazards was
examined by reviewing cumulative sums of Martingale residuals (42).
The proportional hazards assumption was met by the E-DII; however,
several covariates did not meet the assumptions. The STRATA statement
in the PHREG procedure in SAS was then used for these covariates,
along with age, sex, and race/ethnicity, because of the different
underlying risk curves for these groups (Tables 2–4, footnotes). Addition-
ally, tests for trend across E-DII quartiles were performed with the use of the
median E-DII value per quartile as a continuous measure. For all models,
the E-DII also was analyzed as a continuous variable in order to express the
HRs per unit increase (i.e., ;7% of its maximum range) in the E-DII.

All analyses were performed separately by sex and then by sex and
race/ethnicity. Additionally, for women, stratiﬁcations by hormone use
(i.e., not using, previously used, or currently using) were investigated.
CRC incidence by anatomical location (colon, rectum, or both) and
disease stage at diagnosis category (local, regional, or distant) were
analyzed as additional outcomes. Lastly, in a sensitivity analysis to
investigate the effect of preclinical disease on our ﬁndings, cases
diagnosed within 3 y of enrollment were removed (n = 770), and the
main models were rerun.

Results

A total of 190,963 participants were included in the analyses. The
distribution of participant characteristics across increasing quar-
tiles of the E-DII is provided in Table 1. A lower percentage of
women (18%) and a higher percentage of men (34%) were in
E-DII quartile 4 (most proinﬂammatory) compared with the other
quartiles. White and African-American participants were equally
distributed across the quartiles; however, native Hawaiians had
the largest percentage in quartile 4 (35%). Quartile 4 included
lower percentages of participants who were graduate-school

educated (19%), nonsmokers (19%), supplement users (19%),
and women who reported currently or previously using hor-
mones, particularly estrogen (16% and 15%, respectively).
Participants in quartile 4 also were younger (57.4 6 8.8 y) and
had a higher BMI (27.0 6 5.3) than did participants in quartile
1 (62.0 6 8.5 y and 26.0 6 4.9, respectively). Only 18% of
participants who reported a past diagnosis of diabetes were in
quartile 4 compared with 31% in quartile 1.

In our analysis of CRC incidence (Table 2), a more
proinﬂammatory diet (quartile 4 compared with quartile 1) was
associated with an increased risk of CRC (HR: 1.21; 95% CI:
1.11, 1.32; P-trend <0.01) for all participants. The P value for
the interaction between sex and the E-DII was 0.17, and analyses
that used sex-speciﬁc quartiles showed no differences from the
results presented here. The association for quartile 4 compared
with quartile 1 was statistically signiﬁcant in men (HR: 1.28;
95% CI: 1.13, 1.45; P-trend <0.01) and in women (HR: 1.16;
95% CI: 1.02, 1.33; P-trend = 0.13); however, the association
across quartiles was not signiﬁcant for women, as indicated by
the nonsigniﬁcant P-trend. When examining the E-DII as a
continuous measure, a 1-unit increase in the E-DII score was
associated with a 4% (95% CI for HR: 1.02, 1.06), 5% (95% CI
for HR: 1.03, 1.07), and 2% (95% CI for HR: 1.00, 1.05)
increase in CRC risk in all participants, men, and women,
respectively. After removal of cases diagnosed <3 y after
baseline, results were unchanged for men. The association for
women also was similar, but no longer statistically signiﬁcant
(HR: 1.14; 95% CI: 0.99, 1.32).

When analyses were stratiﬁed by race/ethnicity for men
(E-DII by race/ethnicity interaction, P = 0.01) and for women
(P = 0.20), a more proinﬂammatory diet was associated with an
increased risk of CRC across groups (Table 3), although the
association for women was not statistically signiﬁcant for most
of the racial/ethnic groups. The HRs for quartile 4 compared
with quartile 1 of the E-DII ranged from 0.86 to 1.72 in men and
from 0.98 to 2.33 in women. The largest increase in risk was
seen in native Hawaiian women (quartile 4 compared with
quartile 1, HR: 2.33; 95% CI: 1.38, 3.93; P-trend <0.01) and
Latino men (HR: 1.72; 95% CI: 1.26, 2.34; P-trend <0.01).
Statistically signiﬁcant increases in risk also were seen for white
men (HR: 1.39; 95% CI: 1.04, 1.84; P-trend = 0.08) and Japanese-
American men (HR: 1.25; 95% CI: 1.02, 1.53; P-trend = 0.01).
A statistically signiﬁcant increase in CRC risk per 1-unit increase
in the E-DII was observed for white, Japanese-American, and
Latino men, as well as for native Hawaiian women (Table 3). After
removal of cases diagnosed <3 y after baseline, there were no
differences, except that the association for Japanese-American
men was no longer statistically signiﬁcant (HR: 1.18; 95% CI:
0.94, 1.47).

Analyses conducted separately for colon and rectal cancers
showed positive associations between a proinﬂammatory diet
and disease risk regardless of location and stage at diagnosis
(Table 4). The association was similar for colon cancer
(HR: 1.20; 95% CI: 1.09, 1.33; P-trend < 0.01) and rectal cancer
(HR: 1.22; 95% CI: 0.1.02, 1.47; P-trend = 0.01). Positive
associations were found between quartile 4 and quartile 1 for
advanced CRC (distant spread) (HR: 1.40; 95% CI: 1.11, 1.77;
P-trend = 0.01), regional CRC (HR: 1.24; 95% CI: 1.08, 1.43;
P-trend < 0.01) and, to a lesser extent, localized CRC (HR: 1.14;
95% CI: 1.00, 1.31; P-trend = 0.07). The association across
quartiles was not signiﬁcant for localized CRC, as indicated by
the nonsigniﬁcant P-trend. The associations that used the
continuous form of the E-DII were statistically signiﬁcant for all
locations and stages examined. A 1-unit increase in the E-DII was

associated with a 5% (95% CI for HR: 1.01, 1.08) and 4% (95%
CI for HR: 1.02, 1.06) increase in risk of rectal and colon cancers,
respectively. The increase in CRC risk associated with a 1-unit
increase in the E-DII ranged from 7% (95% CI for HR: 1.03,
1.11) for distant disease to 3% (95% CI for HR: 1.01, 1.06) for
local disease. After removal of cases diagnosed <3 y after follow-
up, the association for localized disease remained the same, but
was nonsigniﬁcant (HR: 1.14; 95% CI: 0.99, 1.33).

Discussion

Unlike other dietary patterns and diet-quality indexes, the DII
was designed to assess dietary quality based on a biological
mechanism (i.e., inﬂammation), which makes it particularly
important in examining the role of diet and risk of CRC. This
analysis is the ﬁrst to examine associations between the E-DII

and CRC risk across racial/ethnic groups. In this examination of
data from the MEC, a more proinﬂammatory diet was associated
with an increased risk of CRC in men and, to a lesser degree, in
women. The analysis of the E-DII stratiﬁed by sex and race/ethnicity
was statistically signiﬁcant for white, Japanese-American, and
Latino men, as well as native Hawaiian women. The strongest
associations were seen in native Hawaiian women and Latino men,
in whom a more proinﬂammatory diet was associated with an
increased risk of CRC. Increased risks of both colon and rectal
cancers also were observed with a more proinﬂammatory diet, as
was a greater risk of more advanced cancers.

The DII and its association with CRC have been examined in
several cohort and case-control studies (25–29). To our knowl-
edge, this is one of the ﬁrst DII-CRC studies to use the method of
adjusting the DII for energy intake; so although E-DII scores in
this study had a range similar to previous studies, absolute scores

are not directly comparable. Both the WomenÕs Health Initiative
and the Iowa WomenÕs Health Study found that women who
consumed the most proinﬂammatory diets had an ;20%
increased risk of CRC compared with women who consumed
the most anti-inﬂammatory diets (25, 26). In the Iowa WomenÕs
Health Study, when the DII was based on food without the
inclusion of supplements, the association was weaker and not
statistically signiﬁcant for the highest quintile compared with the
lowest quintile (25). In this analysis within the MEC, the
calculation of the E-DII also included foods only, and a 16%
increase in risk of CRC was seen in women for the highest
compared with the lowest quartile; however, the association was
no longer statistically signiﬁcant after cases diagnosed within the
ﬁrst 3 y of follow-up were excluded.

Examinations of the DII in the NIH–American Association of
Retired Persons (NIH-AARP) Diet and Health Study, as well as a

case-control study in Italy, included both men and women. In the
NIH-AARP study, a statistically signiﬁcant increased risk of
CRC with consumption of a more proinﬂammatory diet was
observed in men, but not in women (28). In the Italian case-
control study, the increased risk of CRC with a more
proinﬂammatory diet was statistically signiﬁcant for men and
women, with the association being stronger for men (29). The
reasons some analyses of the DII and CRC risk show weaker or
nonsigniﬁcant results for women are not clear. Given evidence
that hormone use may play a strong role in CRC risk in women
(41), we explored whether associations between the E-DII and
CRC risk differed for women who were not using, previously
used, or were currently using estrogen and progesterone therapy.
No differences were seen between groups deﬁned by hor-
mone use. Analyses of other diet-quality indexes and CRC also
found inconsistent results in women compared with those in

men (43, 44). Both of the previous studies noted dairy as an
index component that contributed toward protective effects for
women and CRC risk (43, 44). Dietary calcium and vitamin D
have been identiﬁed as potentially important in reducing CRC
risk (45); however, although the DII accounts for vitamin D in its
calculation, because of its methods of construction, it does not
include calcium (21, 22).

When E-DII quartiles were examined for the various sex–
racial/ethnic groups present in the MEC, the increased risk of
CRC with a proinﬂammatory diet appeared greatest for native
Hawaiian women and Latino men. Previous examinations of
hypothetically derived dietary intake patterns in participants in
the MEC found that native Hawaiian and Latino participants
had higher odds of being in the ‘‘fat and meat’’ dietary pattern
than did white participants (30). This pattern was characterized
by a higher intake of discretionary fat and meat, including organ
and processed meats, as well as a higher intake of white

potatoes, nonwhole grains, eggs, and cheese (30). An examina-
tion of the correlation between the E-DII and red and processed
meat found the association to be relatively weak (r = 0.14), but
signiﬁcant (P < 0.0001). An examination of the DII food
components showed that Latino men had a higher mean intake
of protein per 1000 kcal than did the other racial/ethnic groups
for men (Supplemental Table 1). Native Hawaiian women did
not show a higher intake of meat and fat per 1000 kcal than did
other women when the DII food components were examined;
however, their mean intake per 1000 kcal of a variety of other
food components (e.g., ﬁber, magnesium, vitamin A, folic acid,
and b-carotene) was lower than that of the other racial/ethnic
groups for women (Supplemental Table 1).

In this study, a statistically signiﬁcant increase in risk of both
colon and rectal cancers was observed in quartile 4 compared
with quartile 1 of the E-DII. Although ﬁndings related to colon
cancer have been consistent, other studies have been mixed with

regard to an increased risk of rectal cancer with a more
proinﬂammatory diet (25–29). Although cancers classiﬁed as
both colon and rectal were included in the rectal cancer category
for this study, they totaled only 35 cases, and their inclusion is in
line with other analyses that have examined DII scores in
relation to rectal cancer (26, 28). To our knowledge, few studies
have examined the DII and stage of disease. A statistically
signiﬁcant increase in risk of cancers categorized as regional and
distant was seen in our analyses. Participants with E-DII scores
in quartile 4 had a 25% increased risk of regional disease and a
43% increased risk of distant disease compared with those in
quartile 1. Although the magnitude of risk was higher in the
NIH-AARP analysis than in this study, the same trend was seen,
suggesting a connection between more advanced disease and a
more proinﬂammatory diet (28).

Limitations of this study include the small number of CRC
cases in certain subgroups (e.g., native Hawaiians). In addition,
analyses were based on a single assessment of diet at baseline.
However, changes in diet over time for adults may be minimal
and have little effect on CRC risk (46–48). The MEC dietary
data included only 28 of the 45 food components used to
calculate the DII. The use of fewer variables can lead to skewing
toward the right for DII values. However, E-DII scores are
generally low (more anti-inﬂammatory) in the MEC. Further-
more, the DII has been calculated with the use of as few as 19
food components. Validation studies have shown that the
statistical relation is unchanged when fewer food components
are included compared with a larger or full set of DII food
components, and the DIIÕs predictive abilities with regard to
inﬂammatory markers are not reduced (22–24). Differences in
dietary intake reporting (49, 50), social desirability (51), or
the etiology of CRC may exert sex-differential effects on the
associations seen between the DII and CRC risk. Among
commonly used socioeconomic status variables, only education
was available in the MEC, which limited our ability to adjust
analyses for such factors. In addition, factors such as screening
behaviors may affect overall and early detection of CRC. CRC
screening participation by sex and race/ethnicity has previously
been examined in the MEC (52). Although women had lower
E-DII scores than did men in this study, men were more likely to
be screened for CRC than were women, and all racial/ethnic
groups, especially native Hawaiians and Mexican-born Latinos,
were less likely to be screened than were white subjects (52).
These ﬁndings differ from the patterns seen in associations
between the E-DII and CRC incidence, suggesting that partic-
ipants in the MEC with more-proinﬂammatory diets are not
necessarily also less likely to adopt other preventive behaviors.
These study limitations and the multifactorial nature of cancer
limits our ability to make statements of causality.

Despite its limitations, the study has several strengths. The MEC
is a large population-based cohort with a well-established history of
research demonstrating associations between diet and cancer across
racial/ethnic groups. To our knowledge, this examination is the ﬁrst
to look at potential differences across racial/ethnic groups in
associations between the E-DII and CRC. The study also adds to
the literature on CRC risk in men, by anatomic location and by
severity of disease. More research is needed to understand the
inconsistent results across studies of diet and CRC risk for women
and whether our ﬁndings across racial/ethnic groups can be
replicated in other multiethnic populations.

Abstract

Background: Differentiated thyroid cancer (TC) is the most common endocrine cancer. Fish can be an important source of

iodine and other micronutrients and contaminants that may affect the thyroid gland and TC risk.

Objective: We prospectively evaluated the relations between the consumption of total ﬁsh and different ﬁsh types and

shellﬁsh and TC risk in the EPIC (European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition) study.

Methods: EPIC is a cohort of >500,000 men and women, mostly aged 35–70 y, who were recruited in 10 European

countries. After a mean follow-up of 14 y, 748 primary differentiated TC cases were diagnosed; 666 were in women and

speciﬁc validated dietary questionnaires at recruitment. Multivariable Cox regression was used to calculate HRs and 95%

CIs adjusted for many potential confounders, including dietary and nondietary factors.

Results: No signiﬁcant association was observed between total ﬁsh consumption and differentiated TC risk for the highest
compared with the lowest quartile (HR: 1.03; 95% CI: 0.81, 1.32; P-trend = 0.67). Likewise, no signiﬁcant association was

observed with the intake of any speciﬁc type of ﬁsh, ﬁsh product, or shellﬁsh. No signiﬁcant heterogeneity was found by

TC subtype (papillary or follicular tumors), by sex, or between countries with low and high TC incidence.

Conclusion: This large study shows that the intake of ﬁsh and shellﬁsh was not associated with differentiated TC risk in
Europe, a region in which iodine deﬁciency or excess is rare. J Nutr 2017;147:1366–73.

Introduction

Approximately 230,000 new cases of thyroid cancer (TC) were
estimated in 2012 among women and 70,000 among men
worldwide, with a large variability in incidence rates in different
parts of the world (1). The traditional classiﬁcation of TC is
based on morphologic and clinical
features: differentiated
[including papillary (;80% of all TC cases) and follicular
(10–20%)
tumors], medullary (5–10%), anaplastic tumors
(<5%), and other rare tumors (e.g., thyroid lymphoma and
sarcoma) (2).

To date, the only 3 well-established risk factors for TC are
exposure to ionizing radiation (3), previous benign thyroid
hyperplasia (including goiter and thyroid nodules) (4), and high
body mass (5, 6). Among dietary exposures (7–9), potential
associations with TC have been suggested with intakes of iodine-
rich seafood (10, 11), goitrogenic vegetables (12, 13), PUFAs
(14), and alcohol (15).

Fish and ﬁsh products are considered healthy foods in several
traditional

dietary patterns [e.g., Mediterranean diet

Japanese diet (17), and Healthy Nordic Food Index (18)],
because they are rich in essential nutrients, such as protein of
high biological value and minerals (e.g., iodine, calcium, iron,
and zinc) (19, 20). Fatty ﬁsh are also a good source of n–3 PUFAs
(EPA and DHA) and lipid-soluble vitamins (retinol, vitamin D,
and vitamin E). However, ﬁsh can also contain some contam-
inants such as toxic heavy metals and polychlorinated biphenyls
(PCBs) (21–23).

A current review found no association between ﬁsh con-
sumption and TC risk in data from a pooled analysis of 15 case-
control studies (5) and 1 US-based cohort (24). However, further
prospective studies, in larger number of cases, are needed to
investigate the associations between the intakes of ﬁsh and ﬁsh
subtypes and TC etiology, especially by subtypes of TC. The aim
of the current study was to prospectively evaluate the relations
between the consumption of total ﬁsh, and ﬁsh subtypes and the
risk of developing differentiated TC in the EPIC (European
Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition) study.
EPIC is one of the largest cohorts worldwide, with a large
number of differentiated TC cases and substantial heterogeneity
in ﬁsh consumption among participants from 10 European
countries (19) and therefore constitutes an ideal setting to
investigate this association.

Methods

Study population. EPIC is a multicenter cohort that was designed to
principally investigate the role of dietary, environmental, and genetic
factors in the risk of developing cancer. This cohort has 23 centers
located in 10 European countries: Denmark, France, Germany, Greece,
Italy, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Netherlands, and the United Kingdom.
Brieﬂy, the EPIC cohort includes 521,324 participants (70.1% women),
mostly aged between 35 and 70 y, recruited between 1992 and 2000,
primarily from the general population, with the exception of France
(women who were health insurance members), Utrecht and Florence
(women attending breast cancer screening), Oxford (mostly health-
conscious volunteers including a large proportion of vegetarians), and
some centers in Spain and Italy (where the participants were mostly
blood donors) (25). All of the participants gave written informed
consent, and the project was approved by ethics review boards of the
International Agency for Research on Cancer and the local participating
centers.

Dietary and lifestyle data. At baseline, dietary data were collected with
different dietary assessment instruments (e.g., quantitative or semiquan-
titative FFQs, diet histories, or a dietary questionnaire combined with a
7-d food record) that were developed and locally validated in EPIC
previously (25, 26). Face-to-face interviews were conducted in Greece,
Ragusa and Naples (Italy), and Spain, whereas questionnaires were

self-administered in all other centers. Total energy and nutrient intakes
were estimated by using the dietary questionnaires and the standard-
ized EPIC Nutrient Database (27).

For the current analysis, we used the following categories of ﬁsh and
shellﬁsh intake: lean ﬁsh and lean ﬁsh product intake [e.g., cod, haddock,
and plaice (fat content #4 g/100 g)], fatty ﬁsh and fatty ﬁsh product
intake [e.g., salmon, tuna, and trout (fat content between 4 and
14 g/100 g)], ﬁsh and ﬁsh product intake (sum of lean and fatty ﬁsh and
ﬁsh products), shellﬁsh intake (including seafood such as prawn, crab,
and mussels), and total ﬁsh and shellﬁsh intake, which was deﬁned as the
sum of intakes of ﬁsh, ﬁsh products, and shellﬁsh (19).

Information on sociodemographic and lifestyle characteristics, such
as educational
level, tobacco and alcohol consumption, physical
activity, and medical history, was self-reported at recruitment through
standardized questionnaires (25). At baseline, anthropometric data
were measured by trained staff in all centers, except in Oxford (United
Kingdom), Norway, and France, where self-reported data were
obtained.

Follow-up and case ascertainment.
Incident cancer cases were
identiﬁed through population-based cancer registries or active follow-
up (directly from study participants or next of kin) and conﬁrmed by a
combination of methods including health insurance records and cancer
and pathology registries, depending on the center. Complete follow-up
censoring dates varied among centers, ranging between December 2010
and December 2014. Cases were deﬁned as participants with a ﬁrst
primary TC (code C73 according to the International Classiﬁcation of
Diseases, 10th Revision) during follow-up.

Of the 857 TC cases, anaplastic (n = 9), medullary (n = 37), and TC
deﬁned as lymphoma (n = 1) or ‘‘other morphologies’’ (n = 5) were
excluded. We also excluded 29,332 participants (including 45 differen-
tiated TC cases) with missing or null follow-up time or prevalent cancer
other than nonmelanomatous skin cancer, 1277 participants with
incomplete information on lifestyle, and 14,555 participants (including
12 differentiated TC cases) for whom dietary information was unavail-
able or considered to be implausible (i.e., participants who were in the
top or the bottom 1% of the distribution of the ratio of total energy
intake to energy requirement). A total of 476,108 men and women and
6,639,459 person-years of observation (mean follow-up time of 14.0 y)
were included in this analysis. In this study, we had a total of 748
primary differentiated TC cases, including 601 papillary, 109 follicular,
and 38 not-otherwise-speciﬁed TC, most likely to also be papillary TC.

Statistical analyses. Cox proportional hazard models were used to
estimate HRs and 95% CIs for the association between ﬁsh intake and
TC risk. Age was used as the underlying primary dependent time
variable, with entry time deﬁned as the participantÕs age at recruitment
and exit time as age at TC diagnosis, death, or censoring date (lost to or
end of follow-up), whichever occurred ﬁrst. Tests and graphs based on
Schoenfeld residuals were used to assess proportional hazards assump-
tions, which were satisﬁed. Model 1 was stratiﬁed by center, age at
baseline (1-y interval), and sex. Model 2 was additionally adjusted for
the following potential confounders: BMI, smoking status, educational
level, physical activity, and total energy and alcohol intakes. In women,
model 2 was also adjusted for menopausal status and type, oral
contraceptive use, and infertility problems, because these were TC risk
factors in this study (28). Because ﬁsh is a source of iodine and
contaminants, absolute ﬁsh intakes could be as important as intakes
adjusted for total energy. We conducted model 2 with and without
adjustment for total energy and the results were identical; therefore, we
only present the results including total energy in model 2.

The intake of ﬁsh, overall and by ﬁsh type, was assessed by cohort-
wide quartiles or BMI-, age-, or sex-speciﬁc quartile in stratiﬁed
analyses. For shellﬁsh consumption, because of the high number of
nonconsumers (33.6%), instead of quartiles, 3 groups were created:
nonconsumers and those below and above the median of consumers.
Tests for linear trend were performed by assigning the median of each
quartile as scores. Fish and shellﬁsh consumption was also evaluated as a
continuous variable per 10 and 1 g/d, respectively. Possible interactions
with sex, smoking status (never, former, or current smokers), alcohol

intake (0, >0–15, >15–29.9, or $30 g/d), physical activity (inactive,
active, or unknown, according to the Cambridge Physical Activity Index)
(29), and BMI (in kg/m2; <25 or $25) were examined by including the
interaction terms in the most-adjusted models. Separate sex-speciﬁc
models were ﬁtted, because borderline signiﬁcant heterogeneity between
sex and total ﬁsh and shellﬁsh consumption and differentiated TC risk
was detected. Similar models were deﬁned to assess the risk of TC by
subtype (papillary and follicular). Separate models were also computed
to check the variability between countries with a high compared with
low TC incidence. EPIC countries with TC incidence rates of >5/10,000
in women (i.e., France, Germany, Greece, Italy, and Spain) were consid-
ered to have high TC incidence. The Wald test was used to evaluate the
heterogeneity of risk between sexes and TC subtypes. Two types of
sensitivity analyses were performed by excluding the following partic-
ipants from the analyses: 1) 67,391 women from the French component
of EPIC (248 cases of differentiated TC), because French women
represented 37.2% of TC cases in women, and 2) 77 cases who were
diagnosed with TC within the ﬁrst 2 y of follow-up, because some
participants may have modiﬁed their diet during the early prediagnostic
period of the disease.

Calibration of dietary data. A single 24-h dietary recall was also taken
from an 8% random sample of the cohort (36,994 participants) by
using a detailed computerized 24-h recall method (30) to calibrate
dietary measurements of ﬁsh, ﬁsh products, and shellﬁsh intake across
countries and to correct for systematic overestimation or underesti-
mation of dietary intakes (31). The 24-h recall estimates for ﬁsh, ﬁsh
products, and shellﬁsh of the participants with these data were
regressed on the values for these foods estimated from the main dietary
questionnaire values. Age at recruitment, center, and total energy
intake were included as covariates; and data were weighted by day of
the week and season of the year during which the 24-h recall was
collected. Zero consumption values in the main dietary questionnaires
were excluded in the regression calibration models, and a 0 was directly
imputed as a corrected value. Country- and sex-speciﬁc calibration
models were used to obtain individual predicted values of dietary ex-
posure for all participants. Cox regression models were then conducted
by using the predicted (calibrated) values for each individual on a
continuous scale. The SE of the calibrated coefﬁcient was estimated
with bootstrap sampling in the calibration and disease models and
repeated 300 times (31). P values <0.05 were considered signiﬁcant.
Statistical analyses were conducted by using SAS, version 9.3, software
(SAS Institute).

Results

In our study, women represented 70.1% of the total population
and the vast majority of differentiated TC cases (89.0%).
Differentiated TC was ;3 times more common in women than
in men. The most common subtype of differentiated TC was
papillary (80.3%), followed by follicular (14.6%) and not
otherwise speciﬁed (5.1%) for both sexes (Table 1). The median
intake of total ﬁsh and shellﬁsh in men (27.7 g/d) and women
(28.0 g/d) was similar. The highest consumption of total ﬁsh and
shellﬁsh in men and women was in Spain and Norway,
respectively.

Overall, men and women in the highest quartile of total ﬁsh
and shellﬁsh intake were older and more physically active, had a
higher BMI and waist circumference, reported a higher total
energy intake, were more likely to be a current smoker and to
have a secondary education, and had a higher prevalence of
diabetes than those in the lowest quartile (Supplemental Table
1). Women in the highest ﬁsh-intake quartile reported more
infertility problems than did those in the bottom quartile
(Supplemental Table 1).

No signiﬁcant association was observed between total ﬁsh

consumption and differentiated TC risk for

compared with the lowest quartile in either model 1 (HR: 1.03;
95% CI: 0.81, 1.32; P-trend = 0.67) or the multivariable model 2
(HR: 1.05; 95% CI: 0.81, 1.34; P-trend = 0.62) analysis (Table
2). No signiﬁcant association was found with total intakes of ﬁsh
and ﬁsh products or with lean ﬁsh, fatty ﬁsh, or shellﬁsh
separately. Separate analyses of papillary or follicular TC also
showed no signiﬁcant associations with the intake of any type of
ﬁsh or shellﬁsh, and no evidence of heterogeneity in ﬁndings by
TC histologic subtypes.

A borderline signiﬁcant interaction in the association be-
tween the intake of total ﬁsh and differentiated TC risk with sex
was found (P-interaction = 0.07), and therefore results divided
by sex are presented (Table 3). In women, no signiﬁcant
association with total ﬁsh or ﬁsh subtypes was observed. In
men, a borderline signiﬁcant inverse trend between total ﬁsh and
shellﬁsh intake and differentiated TC risk was detected
according to model 2 (P-trend = 0.05), although the associations
for the observed continuous variable (HR: 0.95; 95% CI: 0.87,
1.05), the calibrated continuous variable (HR: 0.95; 95% CI:
0.81, 1.11) (Table 3), or the extreme quartiles (HR: 0.43;
95% CI: 0.17, 1.05; with a low number of TC cases, e.g., 9 cases
in the fourth quartile) were null (data not shown). No signiﬁcant
interaction was observed with BMI status, smoking status,
physical activity, or educational level (P-interaction = 0.12, 0.81,
0.45, and 0.73, respectively). A similar lack of heterogeneity was
observed in the association of ﬁsh intake with TC risk between
countries with low and high TC incidence rates (Table 4). In the
sensitivity analyses that excluded either the large French EPIC
component or TC cases who had been diagnosed within the ﬁrst
2 y of follow-up, the results for any ﬁsh intake and TC risk were
almost identical to those of the entire cohort (data not shown).

Discussion

In the current study, the largest prospective investigation so far
on ﬁsh intake and differentiated TC risk to our knowledge, no
associations with total ﬁsh or shellﬁsh intake were observed. The
lack of associations is especially convincing for papillary
carcinomas and women, which represented the vast majority
of TC cases in EPIC. The intake of ﬁsh and shellﬁsh was also

unrelated to TC risk in all follicular TC and in both low- and
high-TC-incidence countries.

Our results are in concordance with the previous cohort
study (24), a systematic review (5), a meta-analysis (8), and a
pooled analysis of case-control studies from the United States,
Europe, Japan, and China (11). However, a high ﬁsh intake was
associated with a signiﬁcantly lower risk of TC (OR: 0.65;
95% CI: 0.48, 0.88) in studies conducted in areas with a history
of goiter endemicity, such as Italy and certain parts of Sweden
(11). A few additional small case-control studies suggested a
protective association between ﬁsh and shellﬁsh consumption
and TC risk (10, 13, 32).

Saltwater ﬁsh and shellﬁsh are a rich source of iodine, which
is known to play a role in the onset of goiter (33). However, the
possible association with TC risk is complex. A bimodal risk
effect of iodine on the pathogenesis of TC has been suspected
for a long time (11) and was recently shown in a study from
South Korea (34) in which both insufﬁcient and extremely high
iodine intakes were associated with an increased risk of benign
nodules and TC (97.5% papillary tumors). A Danish ecological
study evaluated the incidence before and after iodine supple-
mentation and found that the incidence of TC increased after
supplementation with iodine (35). This trend can, however, be
explained by the increased ability to detect thyroid nodules and TC
after the introduction of ultrasonography (36). The lack of inﬂuence
of iodine from ﬁsh is not surprising because there are currently few
mildly iodine-deﬁcient areas in Europe and iodized salt is widely
available (37). Likewise, extremely high iodine intakes, like those
reported in Japan and other Paciﬁc countries where the intake of
seafood and seaweeds is high, are very rare in Europe (10).

Fatty ﬁsh is a rich source of PUFAs, particularly n–3 PUFAs
(EPA and DHA), that have anti-inﬂammatory properties
through their impact on prostaglandin synthesis and have been
observed to be a protective factor in some types of cancers (38),
possibly including TC (21, 39). A study of long-chain serum FAs
and the risk of TC in Norway (40) showed an inverse association
between combinations of arachidonic acid (20:4n26), EPA, and
DHA serum concentrations and the risk of developing papillary
TC. A similar inverse association between PUFA intake and TC
risk was reported in the EPIC study (14). The protection,
however, may derive from food sources other than ﬁsh
(e.g., vegetable oils and nuts).

1 Model 1 was stratiﬁed by center and age at baseline (1-y interval). Model 2 was additionally adjusted for BMI, smoking status, educational
level, physical activity, and total energy and alcohol intakes and, in women, also adjusted for menopausal status and type, oral contraceptive
use, and infertility problems. EPIC, European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition; TC, thyroid cancer.

Fish can also contain different amounts of metals, such as
copper and cobalt and toxic heavy metals such as arsenic,
molybdenum, lead, mercury, and cadmium (41, 42), and of
PCBs (39). A study on trace elements suggested that an excess in
the concentrations of heavy metals (mercury, cobalt, and iodine)
and low serum concentrations of selenium increase the fre-
quency of goiter and TC (43). In addition, a Korean study
suggested that the accumulation of cadmium in thyroid tissue
may be an important etiologic factor of TC progression and
aggravation in Korean women (44). Fish consumption, with

possible PCB contamination, did not appear to increase TC risk
in New York anglers (39). Given the absence of association, the
role of any of these contaminants is unlikely to be relevant in the
population studied.

The strengths of this study are its prospective design, the
inclusion of a large number of TC cases, and the use of country-
speciﬁc validated dietary questionnaires in a study that showed
substantial variations in ﬁsh intakes across centers (26). The
inﬂuence of prevalent TC on the null associations is unlikely,
because the exclusion of cases diagnosed within the ﬁrst 2 y of

Fish intake and differentiated thyroid carcinoma

1371

follow-up did not alter our present ﬁndings. The most important
limitations of our study include the impossibility of measuring
iodine intake through questionnaires or blood samples and of
distinguishing freshwater from saltwater ﬁsh (which represents
the most frequently consumed type of ﬁsh in Europe). Although
recall bias is unlikely to be important, an inﬂuence of dietary
measurement error in the null association with ﬁsh intake cannot
be ruled out, particularly considering the long duration between
dietary data collection and outcome. We attempted to account
for this by reanalyzing the association with calibrated ﬁsh and
shellﬁsh intakes assessed by 24-h recall with the use of an
established method (31), but the results were largely unchanged.
In conclusion, the EPIC study did not show any signiﬁcant
association between the intake of ﬁsh and shellﬁsh and differ-
entiated TC risk in Europe, where very low or very high iodine
intakes are rare. Further studies are needed to assess other
dietary factors that could lower the risk of differentiated TC,
such as fruit and vegetables, other sources of PUFAs (e.g., nuts
and vegetable oils), and bioactive compounds (e.g., antioxidant
vitamins, polyphenols).

ABSTRACT Red meat intake is associated with colon cancer risk. Puzzlingly, meat does not promote
carcinogenesis in rat studies. However, we demonstrated previously that dietary heme promotes aberrant
crypt foci (ACF) formation in rats given a low-calcium diet. Here, we tested the hypothesis that heme-rich
meats promote colon carcinogenesis in rats treated with azoxymethane and fed low-calcium diets (0.8 g/kg).
Three meat-based diets were formulated to contain varying concentrations of heme by the addition of raw
chicken (low heme), beef (medium heme), or black pudding (blood sausage; high heme). The no-heme control
diet was supplemented with ferric citrate and the heme control diet with hemoglobin to match iron and heme
concentrations in the beef diet, respectively. After 100 d, colons were scored for ACF and mucin-depleted foci
(MDF). Fecal water was assayed for lipoperoxides and cytotoxicity. Only diets with heme promoted the
formation of MDF, but all meat diets promoted ACF formation. The number of MDF/colon was 0.55 ⫾ 0.68 in
controls, but 1.2 ⫾ 0.6 (P ⫽ 0.13), 1.9 ⫾ 1.4 (P ⬍ 0.01), and 3.0 ⫾ 1.2 (P ⬍ 0.001) in chicken-, beef-, and black
pudding–fed rats. MDF promotion by the high-heme black pudding diet was greater than that by the
medium-heme beef diet. The number of ACF/colon was 72 ⫾ 16 in controls, but 91 ⫾ 18, 100 ⫾ 13, and 103
⫾ 14 in chicken-, beef-, and black pudding–fed rats (all P ⬍ 0.001). ACF and MDF did not differ between rats
fed the beef diet and those fed the heme control diet. MDF promotion was correlated with high fecal water
lipoperoxides and cytotoxicity (r ⫽ 0.65, P ⬍ 0.01). This is the ﬁrst study to show the promotion of
experimental carcinogenesis by dietary meat and the association with heme intake.

Colorectal cancer is a major cause of death in afﬂuent
countries, and recommendations are to reduce red meat
intake to reduce the risk (1). A meta-analysis of epidemi-
ological studies by Norat et al. (2) found a moderate but
signiﬁcant association between red meat intake and colo-
rectal cancer risk. In puzzling contrast with epidemiological
studies, experimental studies do not support the hypothesis
that red meat increases colorectal cancer risk. Among the
12 rodent studies reported in the literature, none demon-
strated a speciﬁc promotional effect of red meat (3–14).
McIntosh et al. (3) showed that rats given a diet containing
kangaroo meat, soybean protein, or casein have a similar
incidence of dimethylhydrazine-induced tumors. Clinton et
al. (4) also found the colon tumor incidence to be the same
for beef meat–(raw or grilled) and soybean diet–fed rats.

Nutter et al. (5) found beef proteins to afford signiﬁcant
protection from colon cancer in mice compared with milk
protein. Reddy et al. (6) and Pence et al. (7) found high-
protein and high-fat diets, whatever the protein source, to
increase colon tumor incidence in rats, but beef meat had a
greater protective effect than casein (7). Pence et al. (8)
found that well-cooked beef meat decreased the risk of
colon cancer compared to casein in rats fed a high-fat diet
but increased the risk in those fed a low-fat diet. Lai et al.
(9) found that a lean beef diet did not increase tumor
incidence in rats compared with a casein-iron citrate diet.
Alink et al. (10) showed that human diets containing meat
produced more colon carcinomas in rats than diets that did
not include meat. These results do not support speciﬁc meat
promotion, however, because the human diets contained
more fat and less ﬁber than the rat diets. Mutanen et al.
(11) did not ﬁnd a diet of beef meat to increase substantially
the number of intestinal tumors in Min mice, although it
contained 5 times more fat than the control diet. Kettunen
et al. (12) found fewer tumors in female Min mice fed beef
meat than in controls. Parnaud et al. (13) did not ﬁnd red
meat to promote azoxymethane-induced aberrant crypt foci

(ACF) formation compared to casein-fed controls. Belobraj-
dic et al. (14) found kangaroo meat to promote aberrant
crypt foci (ACF)4 formation in comparison with whey pro-
tein, but whey is known to protect against colon carcino-
genesis (15).

Sesink et al. (16) speculated that heme, found in red meat
myoglobin, would enhance colon carcinogenesis. They dem-
onstrated that pure hemin added to rats diet increases colonic
epithelial proliferation and that calcium phosphate inhibits
the hemin-induced proliferation (17). In line with Sesink’s
hypothesis, we showed that hemin diets increase the number
and size of azoxymethane-induced ACF in rats fed a low-
calcium diet, while hemoglobin diets increase ACF number
only (18). Dietary hemin also produces cytotoxic fecal water
and high amounts of TBARS, indicative of lumen lipoperoxi-
dation (16), while dietary hemoglobin increases fecal TBARS
only (18). ACF are putative preneoplastic lesions, and the
effect of agents on ACF is correlated with the effect on tumor
incidence in most (19) but not all studies. Recently, alterna-
tive short-term biomarkers of colon carcinogenesis were pro-
posed: mucin-depleted foci (MDF) (20). MDF are easy to score
and may predict tumor outcome better than ACF (20,21).

The present study was designed to test the hypothesis that
heme in the food matrix can promote colon carcinogenesis.
The diets used in previous animal studies (3–13) contained
high levels of calcium; we supposed that calcium inhibited the
promoting effect of red meat. Three types of meat were chosen
with different heme contents: chicken, beef, and black pud-
ding. A fourth diet, containing pure hemoglobin, was included
as a control that contained the same concentration of heme as
the beef diet. The myoglobin in beef is very close in structure
to hemoglobin.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Animals. Sixty Fisher 344 female rats were purchased at 4 wk of
age from Iffa Credo. Animal care was in accordance with the guide-
lines of the European Council on animals used in experimental
studies. They were distributed randomly in pairs into stainless-steel
wire-bottom cages. The room was kept at a temperature of 22°C on
a 12-h light-dark cycle. Rats were allowed 7 d of acclimatization to
the room and to the control diet (Table 1) before being injected i.p.
with the carcinogen azoxymethane (Sigma Chemical, 20 mg/kg body
wt) in NaCl (9 g/L). Seven days after the injection the rats were
allowed free access to their respective diets for 100 d. Feed was
changed every 2 or 3 d and water once a week. Body weights were
monitored weekly. Feed intake per cage of 2 rats was also monitored
at periodic intervals (d 5, 62, and 77). Fecal mass was measured as the
total over a 24-h period per 2 rats on d 56, 61, 62, 76, and 77.

Diets. Experimental diets, as shown in Table 1, were based on
the diet fed to control rats (n ⫽ 20 rats) consisting of a modiﬁed
AIN-76 diet (22) prepared and formulated in a powdered form by the
UPAE (INRA). Dibasic calcium phosphate was included at a low
concentration of 2.7 g/kg. Three meat diets given to 3 groups of rats
(n ⫽ 10 rats/group) were formulated to contain varying concentra-
tions of heme as hemoglobin or myoglobin by the addition of freeze-
dried beef, chicken, or black pudding at 600 g/kg meat of the total
diet. The beef and chicken (skinless) meat was obtained from UPAE.
Meat was freeze-dried by LyoFal. The beef contained 0.6 ␮mol/g of
heme while none was detected in the chicken diet (see the assay
below). The low fat black pudding (blood sausage) contained 16
␮mol/g of heme. It was specially made by Recape with 90% pork
blood and 10% starch (w:w) and contained no potentially protective
additives such as onion or milk. One group of rats (n ⫽ 10) received

3 All diets contained 140 mg/kg iron except the black pudding diet
(950 mg/kg). Iron concentration was measured in freeze-dried meat
before the diets were prepared: chicken: 37.5, beef: 172.6, and black
pudding 1527 mg/kg. Other nutrients were balanced: 50% protein,
20% fat, 18 –25% carbohydrate, and 0.8 g/kg calcium (based on added
components, no analysis was done on whole diets).

a hemoglobin diet containing the same concentration of heme as the
beef diet (0.36 ␮mol/g diet). This was achieved by adding powdered
bovine hemoglobin (Sigma Chemical) to the control diet. All diets
were balanced for protein (50%), fat (20%), calcium (0.8 g/kg), and
iron (0.14 g/kg) by the addition of casein, lard, calcium phosphate,
and ferric citrate. However, the black pudding died could not be
balanced for iron (0.95 g/kg). The diets were prepared twice a month
and maintained at ⫺20°C. A TBARS assay showed no lipoperoxi-
dation (data not shown).

ACF and MDF assays. All rats were killed by CO2 asphyxiation
in a random order on d 99 or 100. Colons were coded and then scored
for ACF by Bird’s procedure (23). ACF scoring was done in duplicate
by 2 investigators who did not know the treatment group. After being
scored for ACF, colons were stained with the high-iron diamine-
Alcian blue procedure (HID-AB) to evaluate mucin production (20).
MDF number and the number of crypts per MDF were scored by a
single reader, who did not know the rat treatment or the ACF results,
under a light microscope at 32X magniﬁcation. Lesions were identi-
ﬁed as MDF by the absence or very small production of mucins and
by at least 2 of the following criteria outlined by Caderni et al. (20):
multiplicity higher than 3 crypts, distortion of the lumen of the
crypts, and elevation of the lesion in comparison to normal mucosa.
All lesions were photographed (Fig. 1), and representative pictures
were mailed to Dr. Giovanna Caderni (University of Florence, Italy)
for conﬁrmation.

Preparation of fecal water, assay of TBARS, and heme. For
assay of TBARS, heme, and cytotoxic activity on CMT93, fecal water
was prepared from feces collected for 24 h under each cage of 2 rats,
as previously described (18), but black pudding samples were diluted
twice more than the other samples. For assay of cytolytic activity on
erythrocytes, fecal water was prepared by Sesink’s procedure and pH
was measured (16). TBARS were measured in fecal water according
to Ohkawa et al. (24), exactly as previously described (18). Heme
contents of freeze-dried feces and of fecal water were measured by
ﬂuorescence according to Van den Berg et al. (25) and Sesink et al.
(16), respectively, as already described (18).

Cytolytic assay of fecal water. The cytotoxicity of fecal water
was quantiﬁed by 2 methods, on erythrocytes and on a cell line. First,

d 30. The ﬁnal body weight of beef-fed rats was greater than
that of controls (P ⬍ 0.05, Table 2). Black pudding–fed rats
had watery stools, a known effect of dietary heme, and they
drank more water than controls (22 ⫾ 1 mL/d vs. 16 ⫾ 0.5
mL/d, P ⬍ 0.001). Furthermore, all groups had similar food
intakes; at day 75, intake was 8.4 ⫾ 0.5 g/d (full data not
shown).

ACF. All meat-based diets (chicken, beef, and black
pudding) increased the number of ACF (P ⬍ 0.001, Fig. 2A)
and the number of aberrant crypts per colon (P ⬍ 0.001, Table
2) after 100 d. Chicken and black pudding, but not beef, also
increased the number of crypts per ACF (P ⬍ 0.01, Table 2).
Aberrant crypts and ACF promotion by the black pudding diet
were more potent than promotion by the chicken diet (P
⬍ 0.05, Table 2). Rats fed the beef diet did not differ from
those fed the hemoglobin diet in aberrant crypt number or
ACF per colon. However, the ACF contained more crypts in
the hemoglobin-fed group (Table 2).

MDF. Beef- and black pudding–fed rats had more MDF
than control rats (P ⬍ 0.01), and promotion by black pudding
was more potent than promotion by beef (P ⬍ 0.05, Fig. 2B).
The chicken-based diet, the low-heme diet, did not promote
MDF formation (Fig. 2B). The effects on the number of MDF
also occurred on the number of mucin-depleted crypts (Table
2). The groups did not differ in the number of crypts per MDF.
The beef and hemoglobin groups did not differ for any of the
variables tested (Table 2).

Fecal heme, TBARS, and cytotoxicity. The fecal concen-
tration of heme matched the heme intake. As expected, no
heme was detected in feces of control and chicken diet–fed
rats (Table 3). The analysis of fecal samples stored during the
study of Parnaud et al. (13) where diet containing 60% beef
meat but 130 ␮mol/g calcium yielded similar results: No heme
was detected in feces of control and chicken diet–fed rats, but
there was 1.7 ⫾ 1.5 ␮mol/g in feces of beef-fed rats. However,
in the present study, the heme concentration was higher in the
feces of hemoglobin-fed rats than in beef-fed rats (Table 3).
This is consistent with the observation that less heme iron
reaches the colon when it is supplied as red meat rather than
in hemoglobin form (14). We measured the characteristics of
fecal water because, according to studies on bile acids, the
soluble fraction of colonic contents would interact more
strongly with the mucosa than the insoluble fraction (28). As
expected, the heme concentration in fecal water depended
directly on the level of heme in the diet (Table 3), with, as
noted above, a difference between meat- and hemoglobin-fed
rats. There was no heme in fecal waters in Parnaud’s meat
study, even in samples from rats given a 60% beef diet (13).
Heme can induce the formation of peroxyl radicals in fats,
which may be cytotoxic and cleave DNA in vivo (29). Lipid

the cytolytic activity of fecal water was quantiﬁed by potassium
release from erythrocytes as described by Govers et al. (26). Second,
the cytotoxicity of fecal water obtained with a different method (see
above) was also quantiﬁed by the 3-(4,5-dimethyldiazol-2-yl)-2,5
diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) test on a cell line according to
Bonneson et al. (27). Brieﬂy, the cancerous mouse colonic epithelial
cell line, CMT93 (ECAC), was seeded in 96-well microtiter plates
(1.6 ⫻ 104 cells per well in 200 ␮L of medium) and at conﬂuence the
cells were treated for 24 h with the fecal water sample to be tested and
diluted in the culture medium at a concentration of 10% (v:v). Each
fecal water sample was tested in 7 wells and 10 wells remained
untreated to act as controls. One hundred microliters of MTT (9% in
PBS) was added to each well. After 3 h of incubation at 37°C in the
dark, 100 ␮L of a 10% SDS-0.1 mol/L NaOH mixture was added.
After 1 h of incubation in the dark, the absorbance of each well was
read using a microplate reader at wavelength 570 nm for cytotoxicity
and 690 nm for background.

Statistical analysis. Results were analyzed using Systat 10 soft-
ware for Windows and reported as means ⫾ SD. ACF scoring was
done in duplicate. ACF variables were tested ﬁrst using 2-way (groups
and readers) ANOVA. The (group ⫻ reader) interaction was never
signiﬁcant, and when total ANOVA was signiﬁcant (P ⬍ 0.05),
pairwise differences between groups were analyzed using Fishers’s
least-signiﬁcant-difference test. MDF variables and all other data
were analyzed using 1-way ANOVA and groups were compared using
Fishers’s least-signiﬁcant-difference test. The Pearson correlation co-
efﬁcient was used to determine the relations between ACF, MDF,
heme intake, and fecal values, and P values were calculated with
Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. Because the black
pudding diet contained a very high concentration of heme, heme
values were log-transformed before statistical analysis.

RESULTS

Weight gain and feed intake. Beef-fed rats quickly became
heavier than control rats, and the difference was signiﬁcant at

produced equivalent effects: no lytic activity on erythrocytes,
but a 4-fold increase in CMT93 cell toxicity (P ⬍ 0.001). The
cytotoxicity of fecal water from chicken-fed rats was not dif-
ferent from that of controls (Table 3). All meat-based diets
increased the fecal pH, which was higher when the heme
concentration was higher in the diet (Table 3). Taken to-
gether, these data suggest that cytotoxicity, pH, and lipoper-
oxides of fecal water are associated with heme intake and fecal
heme. Indeed, signiﬁcant correlations were seen between
heme intake and fecal water cytotoxicity (r ⫽ 0.98), pH (r
⫽ 0.86), and TBARS (r ⫽ 0.73, all P ⬍ 0.01, n ⫽ 30 cages of
2 rats).

DISCUSSION

This study is the ﬁrst to show that meat can speciﬁcally
promote colon carcinogenesis. In addition, the promoting
effect was stronger than other promoting agents (30) and
clearly associated with the heme concentration in meat. This
study was done with a low-calcium diet containing 60% meat
and 5% easily oxidized oil. We used 2 putative precancerous
endpoints: the established ACF and the recently described
MDF. Heme in the diet led to ACF and MDF promotion in
the colon. The low-heme chicken-based diet did not promote
MDF, but increased the ACF number.

This study is, to our knowledge, the ﬁrst non-Italian study
to use a new carcinogenesis endpoint which was recently
described by Caderni et al. (20). MDF may predict tumor
outcome better than ACF, as shown in the studies of synbi-
otics, cholic acid, and piroxicam (20,21). We found that MDF
were quite easy to score, but we detected fewer MDF per
control rat than did Caderni et al. (20). This is likely the result
of the carcinogen dose: azoxymethane was injected once in-
stead of twice, and the resulting number of ACF was 75%
fewer here than in the study of Caderni et al. (72 vs. 298
ACF/colon).

That heme content in meat was responsible for promotion
of colon carcinogenesis, at least in part, is supported by the
following facts: (i) all tested meat diets promoted ACF forma-
tion, but this was signiﬁcantly greater in rats fed the high-
heme diet, based on black pudding, than for those fed the
low-heme chicken diet (Fig. 2). (ii) Only heme-containing
diets promoted MDF formation, and the effect was dose de-
pendent, because the black pudding effect was signiﬁcantly
stronger than the beef effect. MDF per colon was correlated
with heme intake (r ⫽ 0.63, n ⫽ 60, P ⬍ 0.01). (iii) Beef and
hemoglobin diets, which provided the same amount of heme,

peroxidation was thus measured in fecal water by the TBARS
assay. Lipid peroxidation was associated with heme concen-
tration in fecal water (Table 3): The black pudding diet thus
increased TBARS in the fecal water by 23-fold. The hemo-
globin diet and beef diet increased TBARS by 2- to 4-fold (all
P ⬍ 0.01), but the chicken diet did not affect fecal water
TBARS compared with the control diet.

The fecal water of hemin-fed rats is cytotoxic, which would
explain the hemin-induced increased proliferation (18). Cy-
totoxicity of fecal water was measured by 2 methods: lysis of
erythrocytes and toxicity on CMT93 cell in culture. The black
pudding diet, a very high source of heme, enhanced erythro-
cytes cytolysis by ⬎50-fold and toxicity on CMT93 cells by
8-fold (both P ⬍ 0.001, Table 3). Beef and hemoglobin diets

RED MEAT PROMOTES COLON CARCINOGENESIS IN RATS

2715

promoted ACF and MDF equally (Table 3). This meat study is
thus consistent with our previous study, where ACF were
promoted dose-dependently by graded doses of dietary hemin
(18). We think that previous studies in rats failed to show that
red meat promotes carcinogenesis because meat was included
in a high-calcium diet. The standard AIN-76 diet contains
130 mmol/kg calcium, which is similar to the concentration
that inhibits heme-induced colonic proliferation (17) and
heme-induced ACF promotion (18). Calcium precipitates
heme in the gut lumen and reduces heme concentration in
fecal water (17,18). In the study of Parnaud et al. (13), the
heme concentration was high in the feces of beef-fed rats, but
was not detectable in the fecal water (see results above). We
suggest that this is due to high dietary calcium, and it resulted
in the lack of ACF promotion by the beef diet (13). However,
the link between heme intake and ACF yield is not a direct
one: black pudding provided a huge quantity of heme to the
gut that was not mirrored linearly in the ACF outcome.

The mechanism of heme promotion is not known, but
might be linked to peroxidation, cytotoxicity, and pH. In a
previous study, we showed that pure hemin and hemoglobin
promote ACF formation and induce lipoperoxidation and
cytotoxicity of fecal water (18). Indeed, heme promotes the
nonenzymatic peroxidation of PUFA (16,18,29). The lipid
peroxyl radicals (LOO䡠) generated from simultaneous fat and
heme iron ingestion, and the resulting oxygen radicals, can
cleave DNA or modify DNA bases, which could increase
carcinogenesis (29). The beef-based diet contained 0.36
␮mol/g heme. Its intake led to 19 ␮mol/L heme in fecal water
and a 2.5-fold increase in lipoperoxidation (Table 3). Similar
TBARS values were seen in fecal water from beef-fed rats and,
in our previous study (18), from hemoglobin diet–fed rats (138
and 187 ␮mol/L MDA equivalents, respectively). In addition,
red meat intake induced fecal cytotoxicity and increased the
pH of fecal water (Table 3). Black pudding contains 25 times
more heme than beef. Compared with beef, the consumption
of black pudding led to 60 times more heme in fecal water, 7
times more TBARS, and a much higher cytotoxicity (Table
3). Fecal water from beef-fed rats or hemoglobin-fed rats (18)
did not induce cytolysis of erythrocytes, probably because
heme intake was too low. In contrast, fecal water from black
pudding–fed rats
strikingly induced erythrocyte cytolysis.
Thus, we conclude that there was a dose-dependent effect of
the heme concentration in the diet and in fecal water on the
fecal lipoperoxidation, cytotoxicity, and pH. All correlations
among these variables were signiﬁcant. In addition, MDF and
ACF numbers per rat were also correlated with these fecal
values (all r ⬎ 0.5, all P ⬍ 0.01, n ⫽ 60 rats, highest
correlation, r ⫽ 0.65 between number of MDF and cytotox-
icity). These correlations suggest that fecal cytotoxicity, li-
poperoxides, and pH may explain heme promotion of colon
carcinogenesis. That hemoglobin and meat diets, with same
heme content as hemoglobin and myoglobin, produced the
same effects also supports this idea (Table 3). Surprisingly, a
published study with a protocol very similar to this one noted
no ACF promotion (14). Fecal heme concentrations were
similar in both studies, but the fecal TBARS value was 2 times
higher in the study of Belobrajdic et al. (14). We speculate
that lipoperoxidation was inhibited by tert-butylhydroquinone
in the AIN-93 diet used by Belobradjic et al. (14). This chance
observation supports the hypothesis that heme-induced li-
poperoxidation plays a role in the promotion of colon carci-
nogenesis.

The low-heme chicken-based diet surprisingly increased
the ACF number and size (Table 2). The chicken meat used in
this study may contain a promoter that is not heme and

remains to be explained. The prominent features of the
chicken diet were high arachidonic acid and niacin. The
chicken diet contained 1 g/kg of arachidonic acid [calculated
from (31)] compared to 0.25 g/kg in other diets. Arachidonic
acid has pro-tumorigenic properties, likely by increasing pros-
taglandin synthesis (32). In addition, the chicken diet con-
tained 207 mg/kg of niacin, 4 times the 51 mg/kg found in the
control diet and twice the value in beef diet (assays done by
LARA Lab). Niacin can afford protection against carcinogen-
esis when added to a niacin-deﬁcient diet (33), but high doses
are toxic. Here, the high dose provided by the chicken-based
diet would translate to 12 times the recommended daily al-
lowance in humans. High niacin stimulates histamine release
and prostaglandin synthesis, which might explain the ACF
promotion (34). The intake of white meat is not associated
with colorectal cancer risk in most epidemiological studies
(1,2). In contrast, dietary heme iron intake is associated with
an increased risk of proximal colon cancer (35). However, in
a prospective cohort study of 34,198 Californian Adventists,
the consumption of white meat, mostly chicken, was associ-
ated with a tripled risk of colorectal cancer (36).

In summary, this study shows for the ﬁrst time a promoting
effect of red meat on carcinogenesis. It corroborates epidemi-
ological observations: high red meat intake is associated with
increased colon cancer risk. In previous meat studies (3–13),
the promoting effect of meat was inhibited by dietary calcium,
as shown by the study of Parnaud et al. (13). Furthermore,
MDF promotion was related to heme intake. Promotion was
signiﬁcantly greater for the high-heme black pudding diet than
for the medium-heme beef diet. This heme effect is in line
with recent epidemiological data (35). The low-heme chicken
diet did not promote MDF, but did increase ACF formation.
For red meat diets, promotion was associated with high fecal
water lipoperoxidation, cytolytic activity, and increase of pH,
which may explain the increased carcinogenesis.

Abstract

Background: Ulcerative colitis causes recurring intestinal mucosal injury and sustained inflammation, increasing the
likelihood of colorectal cancer (CRC) development. Dietary red raspberry (RB) is a rich source of phytonutrients known
to have anti-inflammatory activity; however, the role of RB on CRC prevention in chronic colitis has not been examined.
Objective: This study examined the effects of dietary RB supplementation on inflammation, epithelium repair, and
oncogenic signaling in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)–induced chronic colitis in mice.
Methods: Six-week-old male C57BL/6J mice were fed a control or RB (5% of dry feed weight; n = 12/group) diet for
10 wk. Starting from the fourth week, mice were administered 2 repeated cycles of 1% DSS (7-d DSS treatment plus
14-d recovery) and were monitored daily for disease activity index (DAI) score. Colonic tissues were collected at the
end of the study for histochemical, immunohistochemical, and biochemical analysis of inflammation, differentiation and
proliferation markers.
Results: RB supplementation reduced the DAI score and histologic damage (by 38.9%; P ≤ 0.01), expression of in-
flammatory mediators (by 20–70%; P ≤ 0.01), infiltration of CD4 T cells (by 50%; P ≤ 0.05), and α4β7 integrin and
related adhesion molecules (by 33.3%; P ≤ 0.01). Furthermore, RB supplementation facilitated epithelium repair, as
evidenced by enhanced goblet cell density, expression of transcription factors including Kruppel-like factor 4 (Klf4) and
Hairy and enhancer of split 1 (Hes1), terminal differentiation markers, mucin 2 (Muc2), and intestinal alkaline phosphatase
(by 20–200%; P ≤ 0.01). Conversely, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (by 70%; P ≤ 0.01), β-catenin, and signal trans-
ducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling (by 19–33%; P ≤ 0.05) were reduced by RB supplemen-
tation. In addition, RB supplementation enhanced p53 stability (by 53%) and reduced oncogenic gene expression
(by 50–60%).
Conclusion: RB supplementation reduced DAI score and the risk of CRC development during recurring colitis in mice,
suggesting that RB is a possible dietary supplement for patients with ulcerative colitis and related gut inflammatory
diseases. J Nutr 2018;148:667–674.

colon, which is known to increase the risk of colorectal can-
cer (CRC) development (1). CRC is the third most common
cancer in the United States and Europe and is becoming com-
mon around the world (2, 3). Repeated mucosal injury of the
intestinal epithelium results in aberrant activation of inflamma-
tory signaling and accumulation of immune cells, further am-
plifying the disease severity (1, 4). Epithelium repair or mucosal
healing is a process of coordinated interplay between inflam-
mation, cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation of ep-
ithelial cells in the intestinal epithelium (5, 6), which requires
intricate regulatory mechanisms to prevent uncontrolled prolif-
eration that eventually can lead to hyperplasia and CRC. Under
chronic inflammation, Wingless and Int (Wnt)/β-catenin and
signal transducer and activator of transcript 3 (STAT3) signaling
pathways are activated and promote epithelial cell proliferation

(7). On the contrary, the key tumor suppressor protein p53 (8,
9) is reduced under chronic inflammation and is lost in ∼50%
of malignant tumors (10).

Among cancers, CRC etiology is unique and highly affected
by diet. Western high-calorie diets with low dietary fiber and
polyphenolic compounds are known to increase CRC incidence.
Increasing fruit consumption reduces the risk of CRC and en-
hances the efficacy of anticancer drugs and therapies (11, 12),
primarily mediated by fruit’s bioactive components. Red rasp-
berry (RB) contains ∼50 different bioactive compounds (13),
including anthocyanins, ellagitannins, sanguin H-6, and lam-
bertianin C (14, 15). RB extract exerts antioxidative (16) and
anti-inflammatory activities (17). Dietary RB reduces the sever-
ity of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)–induced acute colitis in mice
(18). In addition, in vitro studies showed that RB extract in-
hibits proliferation and induces apoptosis (19, 20), but the ef-
fects of dietary whole fruit RB on CRC prevention have not been
tested. We hypothesized that dietary whole RB supplementation
reduces the risk of CRC development in mice with chronic col-
itis, likely associated with its anti-inflammatory and antiprolif-
erative properties on intestinal epithelium.

Methods
Animal care and experimental design. Six-week-old wild-
type male C57BL/6J mice were randomly assigned into 2 groups
(n = 12/group) and were fed a standard rodent diet [control (CON);
Research Diets, Inc.] or a CON diet supplemented with RB (5% of dry
feed weight; Research Diets, Inc.) for 10 wk. The pelleted diets with or
without RB were stored at −20°C under vacuum package in the dark,
and fresh diets were fed to mice weekly. The composition of RB powder
has been published previously (18), which includes ∼11 g gallic acid

equivalents/kg dry weight. The freeze-dried RB was powdered then
shipped to Research Diets, Inc., overnight for customized rodent re-
search diet preparation. Detailed information on the diet is provided
in Supplemental Tables 1 and 2. The dietary RB dose is comparable
to a 60-kg human dose of 29.0 g freeze-dried RB/d (21). The detailed
calculation is shown in our recent publication (18), in which the same
supplemental amount of RB was used.
For chronic colitis induction, after 4 wk of the dietary treatments,
mice were treated with 1% DSS (Molecular weight = 36,000–50,000
Dalton; MP Biomedicals) in drinking water for 2 repeated cycles. Each
cycle consisted of 7 d of 1% DSS treatment in water, followed by 14 d
of recovery by providing normal drinking water. Repeated cycles of DSS
exposure were used to mimic the recurring nature of colitis in human
(22). We did not include mice that were not treated with DSS, because
our previous study showed that RB supplementation has no effect on
mice that do not receive DSS treatment (18).

After receiving DSS treatment, the mice were monitored daily for
colitis symptoms during both DSS cycles. At the end of the study, the
mice were killed and colonic tissues were collected for histologic and
biochemical analyses. Mice were housed in a temperature-controlled
room with a 12-h light and 12-h dark cycle and had a free access to diet
and drinking water. There was no difference in feed intake and water
consumption. All animal procedures were approved by the Washington
State University Animal Care and Use Committee (BAF 04316-001).
Tissues were collected and processed according to the previously pub-
lished process (18).

Colitis symptom assessment and disease activity index.
During DSS induction and the recovery stages, mice under treatment
were monitored for body-weight loss, fecal consistency, and blood in
the feces with the use of the previously published scoring criteria (18,
23). The disease activity index (DAI) score was calculated as the sum of
the above 3 scores as shown in Supplemental Table 3.

Histologic assessment of colonic ulceration and goblet
cells. The fixed distal colonic tissue sections were deparaffinized and
subjected to hematoxylin and eosin staining. The pathological scores
of the distal colon were evaluated and recorded blindly with the use of
previously published scoring criteria (23, 24). For goblet cell staining,
the colonic sections were subjected to Alcian blue (pH 2.5) staining,
examined, and quantified with the use of the Image J 1.30v software
(split color channels) (National Institute of Health, USA), as described
previously (25).

Immunoblotting analysis. Immunoblotting analyses were con-
ducted per our published method (26). Band density was quantified
with the use of the Odyssey Infrared Imaging System and Image Stu-
dio Lite software (Li-Cor Biosciences) and normalized to the β-actin
content. Antibodies used in the study are listed in the Supplemental
Material.

Immunohistochemical analysis. Immunohistochemical analy-
ses were carried out as previously described (26). CD4 and in-
tegrin α4β7 antibodies are listed in the Supplemental Material.
The CD4 T cell
infiltration scores were assessed blindly accord-
ing to the distribution and degree of CD4-positive cell staining per
crypt, ranging from 0 to a maximum of 4 (0 = no cell staining,
1 = 0–25%, 2 = >25–50%, 3 = >50–75%, and 4 = >75–100% per
crypt). The α4β7 integrin filtration score was assessed blindly with the
use of the distribution of α4β7 integrin staining per crypt, ranging from
0 to 4, plus the intensity of the stain signal per whole section, ranging
from 0 to 4 (0 = no staining signal and 1 = 0–25%, 2 = >25–50%,

3 = >50–75%, and 4 = >75–100% per whole section). This results in
the total quantified score ranging from 0 to a maximum of 8/colonic
section. Nine sections per mouse at a constant interval were used for
microscopic examination and score assessment.

qRT-PCR analysis. Total RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis, and
qRT-PCR were performed as previously described (18, 25). 18s Ribo-
somal RNA was used as the reference gene. Primer sequences are listed
in Supplemental Table 4.

Statistical analysis. Data were analyzed with the use of a 2-tailed
Student’s t test. P ≤ 0.05 was considered to be significant. Each
mouse was considered as an experimental unit. Data are expressed as
means ± SEMs.

Results
Dietary RB prevents colitis symptoms and histologic
ulceration. There was no difference in the weekly body weight
between the treatment groups before DSS treatment (Supple-
mental Figure 1). RB supplementation decreased DAI scores
during both DSS treatment cycles (Figure 1A). Morphologi-
cally, RB-supplemented mice showed improved colonic archi-
tecture with less inflammation and less crypt distortion than
CON mice (Figure 1B), which was confirmed by histopathologic
scores (Figure 1B).

Dietary RB reduces inflammation and associated sig-
naling pathways. RB supplementation reduced both mRNA
expression and protein levels of IL-6 and cyclooxygenase 2
(COX-2) in colonic tissues (Figure 2A). Consistently, the mRNA
levels of Il17 and interferon γ (Ifng) in colonic tissues were also
reduced by RB supplementation (Figure 2B). The CD4 T cell
infiltration and α4β7 integrin immunohistochemical staining,
mRNA levels of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (Icam1), vas-
cular cell adhesion molecule 1 (Vcam1), mucosal vascular ad-
dressin cell adhesion molecule 1 (Madcam1), and chemokine
(C-X-C motif) ligand 1 (Cxcl1) were all reduced in the colonic
tissues of DSS-treated mice supplemented with RB (Figure 2C–
F). Collectively, these data show that RB supplementation re-
duced DSS-induced chronic inflammation and the resultant
adaptive immune responses.

Dietary RB supplementation improves epithelium repair
as indicated by enhanced differentiation of epithelial cells
in chronic colitis. Dietary RB-enhanced goblet cell density in
colonic tissues (Figure 3A), concomitant with elevated mRNA
levels of mucin 2 (Muc2) and the goblet cell differentiation
marker Kruppel-like factor 4 (Klf4), as well as intestinal alka-
line phosphatase (Alpi), a differentiation marker of enterocytes
in colonic tissues (Figure 3B). Furthermore, both mRNA and
protein levels of Hairy and enhancer of split 1 (HES1) were
enhanced, whereas those of proliferating cell nuclear antigen
(PCNA), a marker of cell proliferation, were reduced by RB sup-
plementation (Figure 3C).

Dietary RB supplementation suppresses β-catenin and
STAT3 signaling in chronic colitis. Cytosolic β-catenin has
an important role in cell adhesion and intracellular signaling,
including cell proliferation (27). RB supplementation reduced
the protein content of phosphorylated β-catenin (Ser 552) and
β-catenin and mucin 1, and enhanced E-cadherin in colonic tis-
sues (Figure 4A–B). In addition, mRNA level of mucin 1 was re-
duced (Figure 4B, C), and phosphorylation of STAT3, involved

670 Bibi et al.

in proliferation and survival of tumor cells (7), were suppressed
by RB supplementation (Figure 4D).

Dietary RB supplementation suppresses oncogenic signal-
ing via enhancing tumor suppressor p53 expression. Di-
etary RB enhanced p53 and its phosphorylation at Ser 20 and
Ser 15, as well as the content of p19ARF, a small tumor suppres-
sor protein that stabilizes p53, in colonic tissues (Figure 5A).
The mRNA expression of p21, a cyclin-dependent kinase in-
hibitor that is a downstream target of p53, was higher in the
RB-supplemented group (Figure 5B). Consistently, mRNA ex-
pression of the p53 downstream targets, antiapoptotic B cell
lymphoma 2 (Bcl2), myeloid cell leukemia 1 (Mcl1), prolifera-
tive cyclin D1 (Ccnd1), and oncogenic myelocytomatosis (Myc)
was reduced in the colonic tissues of RB-supplemented mice
(Figure 5C, D).

Discussion
Chronic colitis is characterized by active inflammation during
relapse separated by remissions, frequently with a progressive
increase in wound region and duration of the disease, which
might eventually lead to CRC occurrence (1). The consumption
of fresh fruit, vegetables, and dietary fiber is associated with a
reduced risk of CRC development (28); phytonutrients in plant
foods potentially reduce the risk of cancer via multiple mecha-
nisms (11, 12). RB is a rich source of polyphenolic compounds,
vitamins B and C, folate, and dietary fibers (13–15, 29). Dietary
RB reduced the severity of DSS-induced acute colitis (18). In
the current study, we examined the protective effects of dietary
RB against chronic colitis, which causes colonic mucosal inflam-
mation and associated epithelial dysplasia, predisposing to CRC
(22). We found that RB supplementation reduced the severity of
chronic colitis and inflammation, modulated immune responses,
enhanced epithelium repair, and reduced oncogenic signaling,
suggesting that dietary RB can reduce the risk of CRC develop-
ment in subjects with chronic colitis.

Chronic colitis is associated with increased production
of inflammatory cytokine IL-6 (30) and other inflammatory
mediators, including COX-2, IFN-γ , and CXCL1 (31, 32).
IL-17–expressing CD4 T cells are present in the intestinal
lamina propria and produce IL-17 (33). IL-17 stimulates IL-6,
which activates STAT3, mediating CD4 T cell maturation,
proliferation, and perpetuation into inflammatory intestinal
tissues (33, 34). As a result, CD4 T cells are aberrantly acti-
vated in colitis (35, 36), and express α4β7 integrin to further
attract leucocytes (37). Vedolizumab, an integrin antagonist
antibody, significantly induces mucosal healing and enhances
remission in patients with ulcerative colitis (38). In agreement,
RB supplementation reduced the expression of inflammatory
mediators, CD4 T cell density, the content of α4β7 integrin,
and adhesion molecules in chronic colitis, clearly showing
protective effects of RB on inflammation and pathological
changes of DSS-induced colitis.

Intestinal epithelium wound healing is dependent on the
homeostasis of 3 cellular processes, including restitution, pro-
liferation, and differentiation of epithelial cells into functional
cells in the injured epithelium (6). Goblet cells are one of the
differentiated functional lineages of epithelial cells that secrete
mucin 2, the major mucin of the mucosal layer shielding the
underlying epithelium from pathogenic microbes and toxic lu-
minal content (39). The depletion of goblet cells and mucin 2
is a characteristic of intestinal inflammation in inflammatory
bowel disease (40–42). Goblet cell density and mRNA expres-
sion of Muc2 and the lineage-specific differentiation factors

such as Klf4 and Hes1, along with Alpi, were heightened in
RB-supplemented mice, indicating enhanced epithelial cell dif-
ferentiation. RB supplementation also reduced cell prolifera-
tion, thus decreasing the chance of CRC development. The to-
tal content of polyphenols could be the main contributor for
these protective effects. Indeed, polyphenolic-rich grape seed
extract protects epithelial integrity by reducing proliferation
and enhancing differentiation in the intestine of IL-10–deficient
mice (41, 42); berry extracts reduce the proliferation of LNCaP
prostate cancer cells and HT-29 and HCT116 colon cancer cells
(43).

Several major signaling pathways regulate cell prolifera-
tion and differentiation, including the Wnt/β-catenin pathway.
Intestinal inflammation is known to enhance Wnt/β-catenin
signaling, which further stimulates cell proliferation and CRC
development (44). In the current study, we found that RB
supplementation reduced the β-catenin content, which is
consistent with a previous report in which dietary black rasp-
berry reduced β-catenin concentration and colonic ulceration
(45); grape seed extract supplementation downregulated the
Wnt/β-catenin pathway and proliferation in the colon of IL-10–
deficient mice (42). STAT3 transcriptionally regulates β-catenin
expression (7) and epithelial cell proliferation and survival (30);
STAT3 is activated in 50–60% of CRC (46). RB supplemen-
tation reduced STAT3 activation, which could be partially ex-
plained by the reduced production of IL-6, an upstream acti-
vator of STAT3 signaling (30). As a result, the suppression of
STAT3 and β-catenin signaling pathways reduces the risk of

CRC. In agreement with our results, the curcumin-derivative,
small-compound FLLL32 inhibited STAT3 activity, which re-
duces CRC development (47). Triptolide (a diterpenoid triepox-
ide extracted from the traditional Chinese medicinal herb) in-
hibited CRC progression associated with STAT3 suppression
(48).

Protein p53 is a tumor suppressor protein (8), which is re-
duced or lost in cancer cells (10). Phosphorylation of p53 at
Ser 15 and Ser 20 stabilizes p53 by reducing its interaction with
mouse double minute 2 (MDM2), which mediates p53 degra-
dation (49). On the other hand, p14ARF (p19ARF in mice) stabi-
lizes p53 by acting as an inhibitor of MDM2 (49). We found
that RB supplementation stabilized the p53 protein correlated
with increased phosphorylation at Ser 15 and Ser 20 and an
upregulated level of p19ARF. These changes could be due to
the biological effects of polyphenols. Green tea polyphenols,
epigallocatechin-3-gallate, stabilized p53 by inducing its phos-
phorylation at Ser 15 and Ser 20, and p14ARF mediated down-
regulation of MDM2 in human prostate carcinoma LNCaP cells
(49). p21 is a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor and one of the
p53 downstream mediators, which initiates cell cycle arrest and
interacts with PCNA to inhibit DNA replication (50). The p53
stabilization increases transcription of p21 and the expression
of proapoptotic Bax, while reducing the antiapoptotic BCL2 (9,
49). Consistently, dietary RB enhanced p21 expression and re-
duced Bcl2, Mcl1, Ccdn1, and Myc, showing that RB suppressed
epithelial cell proliferation and oncogenic signal activation in
chronic colitis.

The bioactive components in whole fruit RB include vita-
mins, minerals, fibers, antioxidants, and polyphenols (51). RB
freeze-dried powder contains anthocyanin, ellagitannins, san-
guin H-6, lambertianin C, and other polyphenols (14, 15).
RB anthocyanin supplementation reduced the production of

IL-6, IL-1β, COX-2, and inducible NO synthase, and sup-
pressed NF-κB signaling in mice (17). RB ellagic acid showed
immunoregulatory functions in various animal studies (52) and
antiproliferative and apoptotic activities in Caco-2 cells (53, 54).
In addition, RB contains 1.6% soluble fiber and 33.5% insolu-
ble fiber (51), which provide substrates for gut fermentation to
produce SCFAs and are expected to generate additional bene-
ficial effects (55). By using the whole-fruit approach, beneficial
effects of RB could be attributed to the combined effects of the
high polyphenol and fiber contents in RB.

In summary, dietary RB reduced the severity of chronic col-
itis, colonic ulceration, inflammation, and associated signaling.
RB facilitated epithelium repair by enhancing epithelial cell
differentiation and mucin 2 production, while reducing cell pro-
liferation, which were associated with reduced β-catenin and
STAT3 signaling. Moreover, dietary RB supplementation stabi-
lized the tumor suppressor p53 and reduced oncogenic signal-
ing, suggesting that RB is a potential dietary strategy to reduce
the risk of CRC development in subjects with chronic colitis.

Metabolic Effects of Dietary Fiber Consumption
and Prevention of Diabetes1

Abstract

A high dietary ﬁber (DF) intake is emphasized in the recommendations

of most diabetes and nutritional associations. It is accepted that vis-

cous and gel-forming properties of soluble DF inhibit macronutrient

absorption, reduce postprandial glucose response, and beneﬁcially in-

ﬂuence certain blood lipids. Colonic fermentation of naturally available

high ﬁber foods can also be mainly attributed to soluble DF, whereas no

difference between soluble and insoluble DF consumption on the

regulation of body weight has been observed. However, in prospective

cohort studies, it is primarily insoluble cereal DF and whole grains, and

not soluble DF, that is consistently associated with reduced diabetes

risk, suggesting that further, unknown mechanisms are likely to be

involved. Recent research indicates that DF consumption contributes

to a number of unexpected metabolic effects independent from

changes in body weight, which include improvement of insulin sensi-

tivity, modulation of the secretion of certain gut hormones, and effects

on various metabolic and inﬂammatory markers that are associated

with the metabolic syndrome. In this review, we brieﬂy summarize

novel ﬁndings from recent

interventions and prospective cohort

studies. We discuss concepts and potential mechanisms that might

contribute to the further understanding of the involved processes.

Background
Consumption of soluble dietary ﬁber (DF)2 reduces postprandial
glucose responses after carbohydrate-rich meals, as well as
lowering total and LDL cholesterol levels (1). These effects are
likely explained the viscous and/or gel-forming properties of
soluble DF, which thereby slow gastric emptying and macronu-
trient absorption from the gut. However, it is not soluble DF, but
mainly the consumption of insoluble cereal DF and whole
grains, that is consistently associated with reduced risk of type 2
diabetes in large prospective cohort studies (2,3). A number of
recent studies give novel insights that might help establish a
metabolic link between insoluble DF consumption and reduced
diabetes risk. Potential candidates are improved insulin sensi-
tivity and the modulation of inﬂammatory markers, as well as
direct and indirect inﬂuences on the gut microbiota (Fig. 1).

Deﬁnition and types of DF
DF are highly complex substances that can be described as any
nondigestible carbohydrates and lignins not degraded in the
upper gut (4). Commonly, DF are classiﬁed according to their
solubility in water, even though grading according to viscosity,
gel-forming capabilities, or fermentation rate by the gut micro-
biota might be physiologically more relevant. Most DF is fer-
mented to some degree. However, fermentation rates of DF
widely vary, with soluble DF (i.e., pectin, inulin, and b-glucans)
and insoluble resistant starch and oligosaccharides tending to be
more readily fermented than cereal DF (i.e., cellulose and
hemicelluloses) (5). Foods are assumed to be whole grains if all
components of the kernel (i.e., bran, germ, and endosperm) are
present in their natural proportions. Whole grain food products
generally contain some 12% of total (mainly insoluble cereal)
DF, and there is a strong correlation between whole grain and
cereal DF intake (2). Some bran derived food products contain
up to 25% of DF. Importantly, deﬁnition of whole grain both in
cohort studies and on labels of commercially available cereal
products typically does not require an intact kernel (3). In U.S.
cohorts, whole grain and bran products from corn and wheat are
the main sources of cereal DF. Main sources of soluble DF are
fruits and vegetables (6) and, to a smaller extent, products from
oat and barley that are rich in both insoluble DF and soluble
b-glucans. It is, however, important to state that most naturally
available high-ﬁber foods contain both soluble and insoluble
ﬁber in varying amounts (6).

DF and risk of diabetes in prospective cohort studies
It is commonly assumed that beneﬁcial effects of high ﬁber diets
[ﬁber intake .25 g/d in women and .38 g/d in men (7)] can
mainly be attributed to viscous and/or gel-forming properties of
soluble DF (1). Therefore, analyzing results from prospective
cohort studies separately for foods high in ‘‘active’’ soluble DF
and ‘‘inactive’’ insoluble DF should be expected to show stronger
protective associations for soluble DF. However, this hypothesis
is not supported by the available data. A recent meta-analysis
that included 328,212 subjects showed no association with
reduced diabetes risk both for fruit [relative risk for extreme
quintiles (RR) 0.96; 95% CI 0.88–1.04] and vegetable (RR 1.04;
95% CI 0.94–1.15) DF intake (2). In contrast, a high intake of
cereal DF was signiﬁcantly associated with markedly reduced
diabetes risk in most studies (RR 0.67; 95% CI 0.62–0.72) (2).
Pooled data for 6 prospective cohort studies including 286,125
subjects indicate that a 2-serving-per-day increment in whole
grain consumption might remarkably reduce diabetes risk by
21% (3). Interestingly, associations for consumption of the outer
bran portion of the kernel, but not germ intake, were compa-
rable to those of whole grain intake (3).

urally high in DF and ﬁber supplements (7). Therefore, reduced
body weight in subjects consuming high DF diets is likely to
contribute to reduced diabetes risk, but it cannot explain the
observed stronger associations for insoluble DF.

DF and hormonal responses. DF consumption affects the
secretion of various gut hormones that may act as satiety factors
(8,16–19). However, in many of the experiments in humans, hor-
monal changes were not linked to acute feelings of satiety. A guar
gum DF supplement produced a heightened postprandial chole-
cystokinin response, but did not alter satiety ratings (16). Insoluble
wheat DF-induced changes of orexigenic ghrelin and anorexigenic
peptide YY (PYY) were not associated with acute changes in
hunger and satiety (8) but may have affected satiety upon the
consumption of a subsequent meal (8,20). Highly fermentable DF
increase glucagon-like peptide 1 levels and may play a role in
the regulation of postprandial satiety in diverse animal species.
However, in humans, no ﬁber-induced changes of circulating
glucagon-like peptide 1 levels have been observed (17,18,21), and
ingestion of a fermentable (pectin, b-glucan) vs. a nonfermentable
(methylcellulose) DF supplement was found to be less, rather than
more, satiating (9). Glucose dependent insulinotropic polypeptide
(GIP) is another incretin hormone that appears to be involved in
the regulation of fat metabolism. Effects of DF consumption on
circulating GIP yielded mixed results. Soluble DF reduced circu-
lating GIP in diabetic humans (19), probably because of reduced
carbohydrate absorption, whereas insoluble cereal DF consump-
tion yielded accelerated responses of both biologically active GIP
(17) and insulin (17,22) in healthy subjects. In a cross-sectional
analysis, high intakes of cereal DF were positively associated with
plasma adiponectin after adjusting for lifestyle factors and dietary
glycemic load (23). Adiponectin may act as a peripheral starva-
tion signal promoting the storage of triglycerides preferentially in
adipose tissue (24). As a consequence, reduced triglyceride accu-
mulation in the liver and in the skeletal muscle might convey
improved systemic insulin sensitivity (25). In summary, various
changes in circulating concentrations of gut and adipocyte
derived hormones can be observed in humans that ingest a high
DF diet. However, no obvious mechanism can be derived ex-
plaining stronger associations for insoluble DF with diabetes risk.

DF and insulin sensitivity. An increased intake of total DF was
inversely associated with markers of insulin resistance in several
studies (26). Investigating different sorts of soluble and insoluble
DF in randomized controlled intervention studies yielded mixed
results. Consumption of wheat bran for 3 mo did not change
fasting glucose and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels in
diabetic subjects (27). High DF rye bread enhanced insulin secre-
tion but did not appear to improve insulin sensitivity in post-
menopausal women, as estimated with the frequently sampled
intravenous-glucose-tolerance test (28). However, using a sec-
ond meal test design, improved markers of insulin resistance
have been reported after consumption of various other sorts of
insoluble DF (17,18,20,29). When measuring insulin sensitivity
using euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamps, consumption of in-
soluble DF increased whole body glucose disposal independent
of changes in body weight in both short-term and more pro-
longed studies (21,30,31). Insulin resistant subjects are more
likely to eventually develop diabetes. Therefore, improved insu-
lin sensitivity could be a relevant factor contributing to reduced
diabetes risk in subjects consuming diets high in insoluble DF.

DF and inﬂammation. Recent studies show reductions of inﬂam-
matory markers in subjects consuming high DF diets (32). Inter-

FIGURE 1 Potential effects of DF consumption. Colonic fermenta-
tion with the production of SCFA can be observed with most types of
DF to some extent, but it tends to be more pronounced with soluble
DF in naturally available foods.

A causal relationship can not be stated, and estimation of
food intake on the basis of semiquantitative FFQ is a known
limitation (2). Moreover, even after statistical adjustment for
potentially confounding factors, residual confounding by addi-
tional unmeasured or inaccurately measured factors can not be
excluded. However, the consistency of the results clearly indi-
cates that the consumption of insoluble cereal DF could play an
important role in the prevention of diabetes.

Potential mechanisms
DF, satiety, and body weight. Potential mechanisms that
indicate DF consumption might alter diabetes risk include effects
on satiety and body weight. A number of studies showed in-
creased postmeal satiety or decreased subsequent hunger when
subjects consumed high DF diets, both under conditions of ﬁxed
energy intake and when energy intake was consumed ad libitum
(7). However, other studies reported no signiﬁcant effects (7–
10). Not all studies (11) showed an inverse association between
postprandial glucose and insulin responses and satiety, and no
clear conclusion can be drawn that low vs. high glycemic index
meals are a key factor promoting satiety (12).

Most (7), but not all (13), observational studies showed an
inverse, sometimes dose-dependent (14) relationship between
DF consumption and body weight. Effects were moderate, with
individuals in the highest quintile vs. lowest quintile of DF
consumption gaining 3.6 kg less over a 10-y period (14). Several
(7), but not all (9,15), relatively short-term interventions further
indicate that moderate reductions of body weight can be
achieved with high DF diets.

Generally, in human studies, no clear difference regarding
weight gain has been shown between soluble and insoluble DF
and fermentable and nonfermentable DF, or between foods nat-

estingly, some sorts of DF have been reported to bind to speciﬁc
receptors on immune cells, suggesting a direct immune–modulatory
effect (5). Other potentially involved mechanisms might include
weight loss when consuming high DF diets, as well as antihyper-
glycemic effects and effects on lipid oxidation (32). Both a diet high
in total DF and consumption of a soluble DF supplement signif-
icantly decreased levels of the inﬂammatory marker C-reactive pro-
tein (33). Fermentation of soluble DF may also play a role due to
potential antiinﬂammatory properties of butyrate (32). However,
reductions in inﬂammatory markers have been reported to be
comparable with both insoluble DF and more readily fermentable
soluble DF (34).

Colonic fermentation and gut bacteria. Short-chain fatty
acids (SCFA) such as acetate, propionate, and butyrate are
produced by bacterial fermentation of indigestible DF polysac-
charides in the colon (1), with the proportion of different SCFA
not being ﬁxed, depending on the substrate and eventually on
the gut microﬂora. Commonly, increased production of SCFA is
assumed to be beneﬁcial by reducing hepatic glucose output and
improving lipid homeostasis (32). Further, G protein-coupled
receptors (GPR)-41 and GPR43 function as direct targets of
SCFA. An interesting ﬁnding was that oral administration of the
GPR41 ligand propionate almost doubled plasma concentra-
tions of anorexigenic leptin in mice, even though no effect on
food intake was detected (35).

However, data not unequivocally indicate that fermentability of
DF per se is a key factor contributing to reduced diabetes risk.
Consumption of low fermentable cereal DF (corn and wheat) show
stronger associations with reduced diabetes risk than more readily
fermentable soluble DF from fruit and vegetables (2,3). When
investigating effects of weakly fermentable insoluble cereal DF
and highly fermentable resistant starch in a randomized controlled

cross-over study in healthy women (17), markers of insulin
sensitivity in a second meal test were improved to a similar extent
with all DF, independent of the rate of colonic fermentation (Fig. 2).
These experiments indicate that a dose-dependent relation between
fermentability of DF and improved markers of insulin sensitivity
was unlikely, even though the limited accuracy of the available
methods to estimate colonic fermentation rates in humans must
be considered (4). Further, SCFA might stimulate adipogenesis
through GPR43 (35), and colonization of germ-free (gnotobiotic)
mice with a prominent saccharolytic member of the normal human
gut microbiota, together with the dominant human methane
producing germ, resulted in markedly improved efﬁcacy of colonic
fermentation, associated with increased de novo lipogenesis and
obesity in the host (36). However, it needs to be emphasized that
nutritional habits and physiological effects of DF intake in rodents
and humans largely differ, with rodents recovering energy from
coprophagia (4). In humans, SCFA account for ,10% of daily
energy intake (37).

DF consumption might affect further factors linking the gut
microbiota with obesity and insulin resistance. Obese subjects
have a different composition of the gut microbiota than lean
subjects, and changes toward the ‘‘lean microbiota’’ can be
observed in obese subjects that lose weight [referenced in (36)].
When transplanting the gut microbiota from obese mice or from
lean mice to germ-free mice, the recipients of the ‘‘obese microbes’’
showed an increased gain of fat mass, even though energy intake
was comparable (36). Interestingly, a high DF diet (oligofructose)
reduced gram-negative bacterial content and body weight, whereas
a high fat diet increased the proportion of a gram-negative
bacterial
lipopolysaccharides (LPS) containing microbiota in
humans [referenced in (38)]. Continuous subcutaneous infusion
of LPS for 4 wk increased weight gain, liver fat, inﬂammatory
markers, and markers of insulin resistance to a similar extent than

Dietary ﬁber and risk of diabetes

a high-fat diet (38). These studies indicate that DF consumption
could have the potential to inﬂuence the proportions of certain
members of the gut ﬂora, thus linking the concepts of bacterial
colonization, inﬂammation, and insulin resistance.

Prospective cohort studies indicate that diets high in insoluble
cereal DF and whole grains might reduce diabetes risk. In contrast,
there is no strong support that soluble DF from fruits and vegetables
play a key role in this context. Many of the proposed protective
mechanisms of DF consumption are either shared by soluble and
insoluble DF (moderate weight loss, low energy density, increased
satiety, effects on inﬂammatory markers and gut hormones), or they
are more likely to be relevant with soluble viscous DF consumption
(hindering of macronutrient absorption, slowing of gastric empty-
ing, reduced postprandial glucose responses, reduced total and LDL
cholesterol, and colonic fermentation). Therefore, other unknown
mechanisms appear to be involved in conveying reduced diabetes
risk in subjects consuming diets high in insoluble cereal DF. A
promising factor contributing to beneﬁcial effects of insoluble DF
consumption could be increased insulin sensitivity, even though
mechanisms leading to this phenomenon need to be deﬁned. Hypo-
thetical mechanisms include a shift in the relation of gut microbiotic
communities, as well as direct and indirect inﬂuences on yet
unknown hormonal and molecular factors in the host that may be
altered in subjects consuming high DF diets.

ABSTRACT The intake of ﬂavonols, ﬂavones and isoﬂavones by Japanese women was calculated from our
food-phytochemical composition table. The relationship between intake of these phytochemicals and various
anthropometric and blood chemistry data was analyzed in a cross-sectional study. The subjects were 115 women
volunteers, aged 29 –78 y, living in the northern part of Japan. Each subject completed a 3-d dietary record and
received a health check up, including urine and blood sampling for biochemical analysis. Total mean intakes of
ﬂavonoids (sum of ﬂavonols and ﬂavones) and isoﬂavones were 16.7 and 47.2 mg/d, respectively. The major
source of ﬂavonoids was onions (45.9%) and that of isoﬂavones was tofu (37.0%). Total intake of isoﬂavones
exceeded that of other dietary antioxidants, such as ﬂavonoids, carotenoids (3.5 mg/d) and vitamin E (8.2 mg/d),
and was approximately one half of the vitamin C intake (109 mg/d). The total intake of ﬂavonoids was inversely
correlated with the plasma total cholesterol concentration (TC) (r 5 20.236, P , 0.05) and plasma LDL cholesterol
concentration (LDL-C) (r 5 20.220, P , 0.05), after the adjustment for age, body mass index and total energy
intake. As a single component, quercetin was inversely correlated with both TC (r 5 20.261, P , 0.01) and LDL-C
(r 5 20.263, P , 0.01). Among Japanese, ﬂavonoid and isoﬂavone intake is the main component among
nonnutrient phytochemicals with antioxidant potential in the diet. These results suggest that a high consumption
of both ﬂavonoids and isoﬂavones by Japanese women may contribute to their low incidence of coronary heart
disease compared with women in other countries. J. Nutr. 130: 2243–2250, 2000.

The Japanese mortality rate for cardiovascular disease and
various cancers, except for gastric cancer, is lower than that of
Caucasians (WHO 1996). More than 600 food factors in
vegetables are now considered to inﬂuence human health
(Huang et al. 1994). A large number of epidemiologic studies
investigating the relationship between diet and cancer were
reviewed, and a preventive effect of the consumption of veg-
etables and fruits on various types of cancer has been con-
ﬁrmed (Steinmetz and Potter 1996). This protective effect has
been attributed in general to the antioxidative capacities of
vitamin C, E and carotenoids in food. However, the impor-
tance of other potentially protective compounds, such as ﬂa-
vonoids in vegetables and fruits, has been recognized (Hertog
et al. 1992a and 1992b). Epidemiologic studies show that
dietary ﬂavonoid intake is inversely associated with mortality
from coronary heart disease (CHD)3 (Hertog et al. 1993,

These results were supported by in vitro studies, such as the
inhibition of LDL oxidation and platelet aggregation by ﬂa-
vonoids (De Whalley et al. 1990, Tzeng et al. 1991). Fla-
vonoids are strong antioxidants and scavengers of free radicals
(Husain et al. 1987).

The Japanese consume a wide range of

isoﬂavone-rich
soybean products (Ministry of Health and Welfare 1998).
Such a high intake of isoﬂavones is assumed to protect against
cancer, especially estrogen-related cancers, such as breast, en-
dometrial, ovarian, prostatic and colon cancer (Adlercreutz et
al. 1995, Watanabe and Koessel 1993, Watanabe et al. 1997).
Isoﬂavones have shown antioxidant activity in both in vivo
and in vitro studies (Ruiz-Larrea et al. 1997, Watanabe et al.
2000a). Genistein, in particular, can inhibit the oxidative
modiﬁcation of isolated LDL (Hodgson et al. 1996).

These phytochemicals may beneﬁt human health if they are
consumed appropriately in the diet. Intake of isoﬂavone-rich

soy hypocotyl tea or isoﬂavone-rich tablets decreased phos-
phatidylcholine hydroperoxide
phosphatidylethano-
lamine hydroperoxide in red blood cells and lowered urinary
excretion of 8-hydroxy-29-deoxyguanosine in humans (Wa-
tanabe et al. 2000a), but hormonal levels were also inﬂuenced
as a result of this intervention trial (Watanabe et al. 2000b).
No guidelines exist for consumption of these phytochemicals;
thus it is not known what level of intake is appropriate for the
prevention of disease. The investigators studied an appropriate
dietary amount of ﬂavonoids and isoﬂavones for the preven-
tion of disease. Accurate estimation of phytochemical intake is
important. We created food composition tables for four ﬂa-
vonols, one ﬂavone and two isoﬂavones to estimate intake.
The validity of this table was veriﬁed by comparing the cor-
related intakes with plasma and urinary isoﬂavone levels (Arai
et al. 2000). The intake of ﬂavonols, ﬂavones and isoﬂavones
was calculated with the use of this table, and the relationship
between these phytochemicals and various anthropometric
and blood chemistry data were analyzed in a cross-sectional
study.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS

Nutrition survey and health check up program. The study was
conducted in September 1997 and 1998 in the northern part of Japan.
An urban rural community (population ;50,000) in this area has
been our ﬁeld for a population-based prospective study and nutri-
tional training since 1980. The subjects were 115 female volunteers,
who each agreed to participate to this study and gave written in-
formed consent. The study design was approved by the Ethical Com-
mittee in Tokyo University of Agriculture. All subjects were house-
wives who also worked in agriculture, such as the cultivation of
vegetables and rice. Fifteen subjects were employees of local govern-
ment and private industry. The physical activities of each subject
were classiﬁed according to guidelines of the Ministry of Health and
Welfare (1994) as follows: light, n 5 27; moderate, n 5 68; and
semiheavy, n 5 20. Ninety-one women (79%) were postmenopausal.
The prevalence of regular cigarette smoking and alcohol consump-
tion was 4 (3.5%) and 42 (36.5%) women, respectively.

Each person completed a 3-d dietary record and anthropometric
measurements were taken on d 4 of the study, including blood
sampling for biochemical analysis. Each subject recorded the amount
and kind of food and beverages consumed during the study period.
These dietary records were then checked by trained dieticians and
coded for calculating the level of energy and nutrients using the
Standard Tables of Food Composition (The Science and Technology
Agency of Japan 1982).

The anthropometric measurements were carried out for height,
weight and blood pressure. Body mass index (BMI, kg/m2) was cal-
culated from height and weight. The number of steps taken during
the study period was measured by a walking meter (EM-200, Yamasa
Watch, Tokyo, Japan). The subjects constantly wore a walking meter
from rising in the morning to bedtime at night.

After an overnight fast, blood samples were collected with a
vacuum syringe containing heparin powder. The plasma was isolated
by centrifugation (2000 3 g, 10 min, 4°C) and used for biochemical
analysis of total protein (TP), albumin, total cholesterol (TC), tri-
acylglycerol (TG), HDL cholesterol (HDL-C), uric acid, creatinine,
glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT), glutamic pyruvic transam-
inase (GPT), g-glutamyl transpeptidase (g-GTP), alkaline phospha-
tase, cholinesterase and total bilirubin. Biochemical analysis was
done with a clinical analyzer (Hitachi 7250, Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan).
Plasma LDL cholesterol concentration (LDL-C) was calculated using
the Friedewald formula (Friedewald et al. 1972). The albumin/glob-
ulin ratio was calculated from the concentration of TP and albumin.
The RBC count, hemoglobin and white blood cell count were ana-
lyzed from whole blood by an automatic analyzer (SE-9000, SYS-
MEX, Hyogo, Japan).

Analysis of ﬂavonols, ﬂavone and isoﬂavones in food. The
amounts of four kinds of ﬂavonols (myricetin, ﬁsetin, quercetin and

kaempferol) and one kind of ﬂavone (luteolin) were determined in 15
vegetables, 8 fruits, 2 legumes, 1 potato and green tea. The amounts
of two kinds of isoﬂavones (daidzein and genistein) were determined
in soybeans, bean sprouts and traditional Japanese soybean products,
such as tofu (soybean curd), natto (fermented soybean), miso (soy-
bean paste) and shoyu (soy sauce). In most cases, at least three food
samples were purchased at a local market and prepared for analysis on
the same day. The whole foods were washed in water, chopped and
homogenized. The samples were then freeze-dried and kept frozen at
280°C until analysis.

The analysis of ﬂavonols and ﬂavone was carried out by a modiﬁed
method of hydrolysis by Hertog et al. (1992b), and extraction and
HPLC condition by Terada and Miyabe (1993) and Shimoi et al.
(1997). In brief, a 0.25-g freeze-dried food sample was extracted with
25 mL of 50% methanol containing 1.2 mol/L HCl and 1.6 g/L
tert-butylhydroquinone for 2 h at 90°C. The extract was diluted to
100 mL with methanol. After centrifugation (1000 3 g, 5 min, 4°C),
a 2-mL aliquot was dried by evaporation under nitrogen gas ﬂow,
dissolved in 20 mL of methanol and added to 1.5 mL of 0.01 mol/L
oxalic acid. Finally, it was applied to Sep-Pak C18 cartridges (Waters,
Milford, MA). These were washed with 1 mL of 0.01 mol/L oxalic
acid, 1 mL methanol/water/0.01 mol/L oxalic acid (25:73:2. v/v/v)
and 10 mL water; the ﬂavonoids were eluted with 5 mL methanol and
the methanol fraction was dried by evaporation under nitrogen gas
ﬂow. The residue was dissolved in 100 mL methanol, of which 10 mL
was used for HPLC analysis. Flavonoids were measured by the JASCO
HPLC system (JASCO, Tokyo, Japan) with a Capcell Pak C18-
UG120 column (150 3 4.6 mm i.d., 5-mm particle size) (Shiseido,
Tokyo, Japan) at 50°C. Flavonoid peaks were detected at 372 nm.
The ﬂow rate was carried out at 0.7 mL/min and the mobile phase was
methanol/distilled water/0.5 mol/L oxalic acid solution (40:60:2, v/v/
v). The retention times of the ﬂavonoids were 3.4 (myricetin), 3.9
(ﬁsetin), 6.2 (quercetin), 7.5 (luteolin) and 11.0 min (kaempferol).
The isoﬂavones were analyzed using the hydrolysis and extraction
method of Mazur et al. (1996) combined with the HPLC method
described by Gamache et al. (1997). Freeze-dried samples (0.01 g)
were put in glass tubes and 0.5 mL of distilled water was added to
each. After the samples stood for 10 min, they were hydrolyzed
overnight at 37°C with 0.5 mL of an enzyme solution [0.5 mL Helix
pomatia juice (Type HP-2S, Sigma, St. Louis, MO) in 10 mL of 0.2
mol/L acetate buffer (pH 4.0) containing 0.15 g ascorbic acid]. The
hydrolyzed samples were extracted twice with 5 mL diethyl ether, and
the ether fraction was dried by evaporation under nitrogen gas ﬂow.
The residue was dissolved in 1 mL methanol, and 20 mL of that
solution was analyzed by HPLC with diode-array UV detection scan-
ning from 250 to 400 nm (Beckman Coulter K.K., Tokyo, Japan).
Isoﬂavone peaks were detected at 254 nm. The HPLC column ODS-
80Ts-Qa (150 3 4.6 mm i.d., 5-mm particle size) (Tosoh, Tokyo,
Japan) was used with a guard column (TSKguardgel ODS-80Ts, 1.5
3 3.2 mm i.d., 5 mm particle size) (Tosoh), and the temperature kept
at 25°C using a column oven. HPLC analysis was carried out by linear
gradient, from 1.5:0.5:8.0 [methanol, acetonitrile, 0.2 mol/L acetate
buffer (pH 4.0), v/v/v] to 6.0:3.0:1.0 for 45 min, and returned to the
initial condition for 5 min. The ﬂow rate was 1.0 mL/min. The
retention times of daidzein and genistein were 21.0 and 25.0 min,
respectively.

All measurements were carried out in duplicate. Quantiﬁcation of
each ﬂavonoid and isoﬂavone was done by measuring peak areas on
the basis of calibration plots of the peak area of standards at various
concentrations. HPLC standards were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
Japan K.K. (Osaka, Japan; quercetin and myricetin), Funakoshi (To-
kyo, Japan; kaempherol), Wako Pure Chemicals (Osaka, Japan; lu-
teolin and ﬁsetin) and Indoﬁne Chemical Company (Somerville, NJ;
daidzein and genistein). All solvents and chemicals used were HPLC
grade or analytical grade.

Statistical analysis. Statistical analysis was conducted using the
SPSS package (SPSS 1998). Pearson’s correlation coefﬁcients were
calculated between intake of antioxidant vitamins and phytochemi-
cals and dietary variables or various health indices, such as anthro-
pometric and blood biochemical analysis data. Two-sided P-values
, 0.05 were considered signiﬁcant. Signiﬁcant association was fur-

antioxidative activity and selected foods rich in phytochemi-
cals are shown in Table 3. There was no signiﬁcant difference
in dietary intake of nutrients or food groups between premeno-
pausal and postmenopausal women. The average intake of
energy and nutrients exceeded the recommended dietary al-
lowance for Japanese (Fig. 1).

Intake of total ﬂavonoids (sum of myricetin, ﬁsetin, quer-
cetin, kaempferol and luteolin) calculated from the 3-d dietary
records using our ﬂavonoid composition table (Table 4) was
16.7 6 9.2 mg/d, ranging from 2.0 to 42.4 mg/d (Fig. 2). The
composition of the total ﬂavonoid intake was 55.9% quercetin,
35.3% kaempferol, 4.6% ﬁsetin, 2.5% myricetin and 1.7%
luteolin. Among the ﬁve ﬂavonoids, the intake of quercetin
and kaempherol was greatest (Table 5).

Onions were the main source of total ﬂavonoid intake
(45.9%, 23.1 g/d), followed by molokheya (9.7%, 4.6 g/d),

apples (7.2%, 22.2 g/d) and green tea (5.4%, 206 mL/d). The
intake of ﬂavonoids was attributable to vegetables (72.3%),
fruits (15.6%), green tea (5.4%), potatoes (3.8%) and pulses
(tofu) (2.9%) (Table 5). Quercetin intake came mainly from
onions (83.6%), whereas kaempferol came from various veg-
etables and fruits. Vegetable and fruit intake, used for the
calculation of ﬂavonoid intake, consisted of 78.0 and 70.4% of
all vegetable and fruit consumption by weight, respectively, in
the dietary records.

Intake of total isoﬂavones (sum of daidzein and genistein)
calculated from the 3-d dietary records using the isoﬂavone
composition table (Table 6) was 47.2 6 23.6 mg/d, ranging
from 12.0 to 118.9 mg/d (Fig. 2). Isoﬂavone intake exceeded
100 mg/d in six subjects (5.2%). Genistein made up most of
the isoﬂavone intake (30.5 6 15.6 mg/d), and daidzein intake
(16.6 6 8.0 mg/d) was about half that of genistein (Table 7).
Isoﬂavone intake was attributable to tofu (sum of various
types, 37.0%, 49.4 g/d), natto (31.0%, 14.8 g/d) and miso
(15.7%, 17.0 g/d), which accounted for 84.3% of pulse con-
sumption by weight in the dietary records (Table 7).

Flavonoid intake was positively correlated with vitamin C
intake (r 5 0.426, P , 0.01), as was carotenoid intake (r
5 0.347, P , 0.001), vegetable intake (r 5 0.402, P , 0.001)
and fruit intake (r 5 0.210, P , 0.05). Dietary ﬁber intake
correlated positively with both total ﬂavonoid intake (r
5 0.265, P , 0.001) and total isoﬂavone intake (r 5 0.414, P
, 0.001). Vitamin E intake did not correlate with ﬂavonoid
and isoﬂavone intake. These associations remained unchanged
after adjustment for total energy intake.

After adjustment for age, BMI and total energy intake,

ﬂavonoid intake was inversely associated with plasma TC (r
5 20.236, P , 0.05) and LDL-C (r 5 20.220, P , 0.05).
Among the ﬁve ﬂavonoids, quercetin intake was inversely
correlated with plasma TC (r 5 20.261, P , 0.01) and
LDL-C (r 5 20.263, P , 0.01) (Fig. 3). After further adjust-
ment for age, BMI and total energy intake, dietary variables
(intake of fat, carotenoids, vitamin C, dietary ﬁber and cho-
lesterol), green tea consumption, number of steps taken, sys-
tolic and diastolic blood pressure, cigarette use, alcohol use
and menopausal status, the association between quercetin in-
take and plasma LDL-C was unaffected (r 5 20.316, P
, 0.01). Plasma HDL-C and TG, however, did not correlate
with the intake of any ﬂavonoids. Isoﬂavone, carotenoid,
vitamin C and E intakes were not signiﬁcantly correlated with
plasma lipid concentrations. Other blood and biochemical
data were not correlated with the intake of any ﬂavonoids,
isoﬂavones or antioxidant vitamins.

DISCUSSION

The biological function of phytochemicals has increasing
importance in nutritional science. Epidemiologic studies in
Japan have suggested the importance of isoﬂavone intake to
prevent estrogen-related cancers, osteoporosis and menopausal
symptoms (Adlercreutz and Mazur 1997, Watanabe and Koes-
sel 1993).

We estimated the intakes of ﬂavonols, ﬂavone and isoﬂa-
vones in Japanese women and tried to determine any relation-
ship that existed between these phytochemicals and various

measurements of the amount of ﬂavonoids in foods was achiev-
ing complete hydrolysis of all glycosides of ﬂavonols, ﬂavones
and isoﬂavones without substantial loss of ﬂavonoid and isoﬂa-
vone. In the case of isoﬂavones, enzymatic hydrolysis of glu-
curonidase, sulfatase and other unknown enzymes in Helix
pomatia juice yielded a maximum amount of isoﬂavones (Ma-
zur et al. 1996). In contrast, ﬂavonol and ﬂavone hydrolysis
presented some difﬁculty. Harborne (1965) reported that the
time required for complete hydrolysis depended on the binding
site of sugar on the ﬂavonoid nucleus: C7.C49.C3. Onions
contain mainly C49 glycosides and tea C3 rutinosides (rutin).
Apples contain a variety of quercetin glycosides, such as gla-
ctosides and rhamnosides (Harrmann 1976). Hertog et al.

study drawn from a population-based prospective study.

Our content table for ﬂavonols, ﬂavone and isoﬂavones
agrees well with previous reports. Hertog et al. (1992a) re-
ported that the quercetin concentration in onions was 347
mg/g, and Crozier et al. (1997) reported it to be 342 mg/g. We
obtained a similar value (337 mg/g). Toda et al. (1997) re-
ported concentrations of isoﬂavones in 24 commercial Japa-
nese soybean foods. Their isoﬂavone values and ours (sum of
daidzein and genistein) are shown as follows: tofu (momen

(1992 b) reported that ﬂavonoid content after .2 h of hydro-
lysis was 10% higher than that after only 2 h of hydrolysis.
Because we did not optimize conditions according to food
type, ﬂavonoid content in some foods could have been under-
estimated.

The average intake of ﬂavonoids was 16.7 6 9.2 mg/d in
this study. This value agrees well with our previous study, in
which the average ﬂavonoid intake was 16.2 6 9.5 mg/d
(Kimira et al. 1998). Shimoi and Kinae (1997) analyzed the
ﬂavonoid concentration in seven different kinds of duplicate
meals. The range of ﬂavonoid concentration was from ;5 to
30 mg/meal. Thus the intake of ﬂavonoids in the Japanese diet
is estimated to be from 10 to 90 mg/d. Hertog et al. (1995)
estimated that the average intake of total ﬂavonoids was ;65
mg/d in two areas in the western part of Japan. Tea was the
major source of ﬂavonoids in their study, in which . 80% of
ﬂavonoid intake came from about seven cups (700 mL) of
green tea per day. In our study, the main sources of ﬂavonoid
intake were vegetables,
tomatoes and
molokheya, followed by fruits and green tea. The average
intake of green tea was 206 mL/d (2 cups). The intake of

catechin [(-)-epigallocatechin gallate] from tea was estimated
to be ;40 mg/d.

Willet (1998) reported that the number of days required for
the estimation of various nutrient intakes differed greatly.
Wakai et al. (1999) calculated that the number of days re-
quired for determining 95% of the observed values of daidzein
and genistein was 34, 76 and 305 d to obtain accurate intake
estimates within a range of 30, 20 and 10%, respectively. Our
study considered only ﬁve types of ﬂavonoids out of 4000 that
are known; but these ﬁve are known to be important compo-

nents because of their antimutagenic (Kanazawa et al. 1997)
and antioxidative properties (Catapano 1997, Ho 1997).

Regardless of the above-described limitations, the present
study showed that plasma LDL-C correlated inversely with the
intake of quercetin, even after adjusting for other antioxidant
vitamins.

Igarashi and Ohmura (1995) reported that rats fed a cho-
lesterol-enriched diet had lower TC when diets were supple-
mented with isoramnetin, rhamnetin or quercetin, among
which quercetin was the most effective. The fecal excretion of
cholesterol and bile acids from rats fed quercetin was slightly
higher than that of control rats. Flavonoids have been re-
ported to have an antioxidant effect due to their ability to
scavenge free radicals or to chelate metal ions (Belguendouz et
al. 1997, Husain et al. 1987). It has been suggested that the
TC- and LDL-C–reducing effects of ﬂavonoids prevent CHD
and other chronic diseases in concert with the antioxidative
effect of ﬂavonoids.

Imai and Nakachi (1995) also reported a signiﬁcant reduc-
tion of serum TC and TG in Japanese men who consumed
.1000 mL (10 cups) of green tea per day. In our study,
however, green tea consumption was not related to plasma
lipid concentration, and adjusting for green tea consumption
did not alter the inverse correlation of ﬂavonoid intake with
plasma lipids. Cassidy et al. (1995) reported that the admin-
istration of textured soy protein signiﬁcantly reduced plasma
TC and LDL-C concentrations in premenopausal women.
Whether isoﬂavones have a cholesterol-lowering effect is still
unresolved (Bakhit et al. 1994, Carroll 1991, Hodgson et al.
1998), Nelson et al. 1997, Potter et al. 1993. In our interven-
tion study using isoﬂavone tablets, plasma cholesterol and TG
concentrations were not affected (Watanabe et al. 2000b).

Intake of isoﬂavones exceeded that of other dietary antioxi-
dants, such as ﬂavonoids (16 mg), carotenoids (3 mg) and vita-
min E (8 mg), reaching a level that was approximately one half
that of vitamin C (108 mg) (Fig. 2). Isoﬂavones in the Japanese
diet may contribute much to antioxidant effects in the body.
Although the isoﬂavones were not correlated with plasma LDL-C
in our study, these antioxidant properties would contribute to the
prevention of LDL oxidation and lower mortality from CHD (De
Whalley et al. 1990, Palinski et al. 1989, Parthasarathy et al.
1992, Witztum and Steinburg 1991).

Effect of White Versus Red Meat on Endogenous N-Nitrosation in the
Human Colon and Further Evidence of a Dose Response1

Sheila Anne Bingham,2 Roisin Hughes and Amanda Jane Cross

ABSTRACT N-Nitroso compounds are found in the colon and are formed endogenously because amines and
amides are produced by bacterial decarboxylation of amino acids in the large gut. They can be N-nitrosated in the
presence of a nitrosating agent. To test the hypothesis that increased nitrogenous residues from red meat would
increase endogenous N-nitrosation, thus accounting for the epidemiologic association between red meat con-
sumption and colorectal cancer, we fed increased levels of red meat and measured apparent total N-nitroso
compounds (ATNCs) in fecal samples in a series of studies of volunteers maintained under controlled conditions.
A result of these studies is that we have shown a consistent dose response to red meat consumption. Fiber, in the
form of vegetables, bran or resistant starch, does not reduce the level of ATNCs formed, although transit time is
reduced and fecal weight are increased. Here we show that the equivalent amount (420 – 600 g) of meat as white
meat has no effect on fecal ATNCs in 12 volunteers (P ⫽ 0.338). At dosages of 0, 60, 120, 240 and 420 g of red
meat/d, mean levels of ATNC output are highly correlated with dose of meat: for concentration ATNC versus dose
of meat in g/d, r ⫽ 0.972, ␤ ⫽ 0.252 ng/g (SE 0.035); for total ATNC output versus dose of meat in g/d, r ⫽ 0.963,
␤ ⫽ 2.605 ␮g/d (SE 0.419). The effects of nonmeat protein and of heme on increased N-nitrosation and the
genotoxic effects of the ATNCs produced are presently being investigated.

Up to 80% of colorectal cancer cases have been attributed
to diet, suggesting that this cancer, the second most common
in Western countries, is a preventable disease (1). Armstrong
and Doll (2) attributed much of the international variation in
large bowel cancer incidence among countries to dietary dif-
ferences, especially meat and fat consumption. If meat is
associated with increased risk, lower rates for cancer would be
expected in vegetarians; in a meta-analysis of ﬁve cohorts,
non–meat eaters were not at lower risk than meat eaters (3).
However, in the largest study of these vegetarians versus meat
eaters, meat was associated with increased risk of colorectal
cancer (3,4). Two systematic reviews of meat consumption in
relation to colorectal cancer incidence were recently pub-
lished. In 13 prospective studies an increase of 100 g all meat
or red meat was associated with a signiﬁcant 12–17% increased
risk of colorectal cancer, and a signiﬁcant 49% increased risk
was found for a daily increase of 25 g processed meat (5). In 34

case-control studies and 14 cohort studies average relative risk
was 1.35 [conﬁdence interval 3(CI 1.21–1.51)] for red meat
and 1.31 (CI 1.13–1.51) for processed meat (nitrite treated,
cured or smoked, including lunch meats) and meat products
and there was no signiﬁcant association with total meat (6). In
contrast, white meat consumption has been associated with
decreased risk in two prospective studies (7,8).

One explanation for the association between meat and
colorectal cancer is the presence of N-nitroso compounds
(NOCs) formed endogenously within the colon. NOCs are
formed because the amines and amides produced primarily by
bacterial decarboxylation of amino acids can be N-nitrosated
in the presence of a nitrosating agent (9,10). A number of
facultative and anaerobic colonic bacteria can catalyze the
formation of NOCs at optimum pH 7.5 (11–13). In the
anaerobic large bowel, nitrate is reduced during dissimilatory
nitrate metabolism by the colonic ﬂora to nitrite from which
nitrosating agents may be formed. Supplements of nitrate have
therefore been shown to elevate fecal NOCs (14). N-Nitrosa-
tion in the colon has been demonstrated in animals and shown
to be dependent on the presence of gut ﬂora (15).

Meat increases the level of nitrogenous residues reaching
the colon (16) so that meat might be expected to increase
colonic level of NOCs. We previously showed that fecal NOC

We have been unable to show an effect of white meat on
endogenous N-nitrosation but have only studied two individ-
uals so far (17). Hence the effect of white meat in 12 individ-
uals, at two different levels, is reported here. In addition, the
effect of 120 g red meat on endogenous N-nitrosation in nine
volunteers is added to previously published data showing a
dose-response effect to 60, 240 and 480 g of red meat/d (19).

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Subjects and diets. Eighteen healthy male volunteers (aged
24 –74 y) were studied in a metabolic suite. During this time only food
that was provided from a standardized menu of normal food was
permitted to be eaten. All diets were constant in fat and nonstarch
polysaccharide (dietary ﬁber) and adjusted for the energy needs for
each subject with extra bread, low-fat margarine and marmalade.
Energy requirements ranged from 10 to 12.5 MJ/d. In protocol 1,
seven subjects were studied for three 10-d dietary periods of 60 g red
meat, 600 g red meat (as beef and pork) and 600 g white meat (as
chicken, turkey or white cod). In protocol 2, ﬁve subjects were
studied for three 15-d periods. The diets were the same as in protocol
1 except that 420 g red and white meat rather than 600 g was used.
In protocol 3, nine subjects were fed 60 and 120 g red meat for 15 d
each. To equalize the energy content of the diets, a glucose polymer
drink and cream were substituted for meat on the 60- and 120-g diets.
All other items of food on each diet of the protocols were the same.
Deionized water was given throughout for drinking and used in
cooking to keep nitrate intake constant. Diets were randomly as-
signed by using a crossover design and subjects were their own
control. Permission for the studies was given by the Dunn Human
Nutrition Unit and Addenbrookes Hospital ethics committees.

Protocols. All fecal samples were collected and stored at ⫺20°C
except for those collected on days 8 –10 in protocol 1 and 13 and 14
in protocols 2 and 3. These samples were processed to prepare
homogenates within 20 min of excretion. Each sample was diluted

fourfold with ultrapure deionized water, homogenized in a stomacher
(Colworth 3500, Seward) for 20 min and centrifuged at 4500 rpm for
10 min. Each supernatant was ﬁltered, distributed into aliquots and
stored at ⫺20°C. Fecal homogenates were analyzed for NOCs and
nitrite by the release of nitric oxide after chemical denitrosation via
thermal energy analysis (21). NOCs detected by this group-selective
method are referred to as apparent total NOCs (ATNCs). All sam-
ples collected during the study were weighed and radiographed, and
recoveries of radiopaque fecal markers (22) were noted.

RESULTS

In protocol 1, 96% of the total fecal markers administered
were recovered (i.e., 4% of markers were present in specimens
not collected after the experimental period). In protocol 2, the
mean number of markers recovered in the fecal samples by
x-ray analysis was 99.0%, and the mean marker recovery from
each volunteer ranged from 98.8% to 99.2%. In protocol 3,
mean marker recovery was 97.7% (range 99.9 –99.6%).

The mean results for all 12 subjects from protocols 1 and 2
are shown in Table 1. Both the concentration of ATNCs and
the output per day were signiﬁcantly higher when the diets
with 420 – 600 g red meat were fed compared with the diet
with 60 g meat (P ⫽ 0.001, P ⫽ 0.009, respectively). However,
ATNC levels when the diets with 420 – 600 g white meat were
fed were not signiﬁcantly different from the low-meat diet (P
⫽ 0.338 and P ⫽ 0.408, respectively, for concentration and
output per day) and were signiﬁcantly lower than those ob-
tained with the diet with 420 – 600 g red meat (P ⫽ 0.014, P
⫽ 0.009, respectively, for concentration and output).

Figure 1 shows individual values of fecal ATNC concen-
tration as a the percentage change from the 60-g red meat diet.
All subjects increased their fecal ATNC concentration on the
high–red meat diet, but there was a large individual variation
in response. Four
subjects exhibited a fourfold increase,
whereas eight subjects increased levels by 1–2.5 times. ATNC
levels in all subjects decreased on changing from the high–red
meat diet to the high–white meat diet to levels found on the
low-meat diet except for two subjects consuming the 600-g
high–white meat diet in whom levels increased on changing to
the white meat diet.

SUPPLEMENT

fecal ATNC excretion during the study was due to endogenous
intestinal formation. This formation is not due to an increase
in the amount of nitrosating agents, such as nitrate, because
nitrate levels have been kept constant throughout to avoid
interference from this factor. An equivalent amount of protein
as white meat in this study had no effect; therefore increased
endogenous production of nitric oxide from oxidation by nitric
oxide synthase of the extra L-arginine present in the high-meat
diets is unlikely to account for any increase (23). The 420-g
red meat diet would have provided ⬃7.3 g arginine compared
with 1.04 g from the 60-g diet (24).

Despite the consistent response to meat, there is substantial
individual variation in the extent of response (Fig. 1). This
individual variation remains despite the highly controlled
conditions under which studies are carried out. The individual
variation may arise from individual differences in gut ﬂora,
with high responders harboring high populations of nitric
oxide–producing bacteria. Alternatively,
individual differ-
ences in iron or protein absorption would alter the amount of
precursors available for N-nitrosation entering the colon. Iron
is required for nitrate reductase activity, which is responsible
for bacterially mediated N-nitrosation (11–13).

Although red meat resulted in the expected increase in
endogenous N-nitrosation in this study, the same amount of
white meat had no effect in 10 of 12 volunteers; therefore
mean fecal ATNC levels were not signiﬁcantly different from
those found in a diet with 60 g of meat. In vitro work has
shown that the heme proteins myoglobin and hemoglobin in
meat react with nitric oxide under anaerobic conditions to
form nitrosating agents with the ability to nitrosate phenol
(25). Under certain conditions, hemes are known to be nitro-
sated and act as nitrosating agents (26). The formation of
N-nitrosoarginine by heme enzymes under anaerobic condi-
tions was also demonstrated (27). Red meat is a much richer
source of heme iron than is white meat; therefore the lack of
effect of white meat may be due to a comparative absence of
heme. Present studies are investigating the effect of heme on
endogenous N-nitrosation (28).

Many classes of NOC have been identiﬁed, including ni-
trosamines, nitrosamides and nitrosoguanidines, and a number
of these are known to cause DNA damage after the formation
of alkylating agents during NOC metabolism. Methylnitro-
sourea was shown to induce G3 A transitions at codons 12

FIGURE 2 Dose response to 0, 60, 240 and 420 g of meat/d and
to 120 g of meat/d (from reference 19 and this study). Eight subjects
were studied at the 0-, 240- and 420-g level, 9 at the 120-g level and 17
at the 60-g level. Mean and SEM bars are shown.

FIGURE 1

Individual changes in fecal ATNC concentration in 12
individuals fed a low-meat (60 g) diet, a high–red meat (420 – 600 g) diet
and a high–white meat (420 – 600 g) diet. Subjects 1–7 were in group 1
(600 g meat), and subjects 8 –12 were in group 2 (420 g meat).

In protocol 3, mean levels of ATNC concentration were
764 ␮g 䡠 kg⫺1 (SD 698) on the low-meat diet and 1164 ␮g 䡠 g⫺1
(SD 1555; P ⫽ 0.205) on the high meat diet. ATNC output on
the low-meat diet was 77 ␮g/d (SD 27) compared with 125
␮g/d (SD 125) on the high-meat diet (P ⫽ 0.209). Figure 2
shows mean values for fecal NOC concentration using com-
bined results from those already published (19) and the results
from these nine individuals studied in protocol 3 (n ⫽ 17 for
the 60-g level). Although differences between the 60- and
120-g levels in protocol 3 were not signiﬁcant, mean levels of
fecal ATNCs on the 120-g red meat diet were intermediate
between those obtained from the 60-g and 240-g diets (Fig. 2).
Mean levels of NOC output were highly correlated with dose
of meat: for ng of ATNCs/g versus dose of g of meat/d, r
⫽ 0.972, b ⫽ 0.252 (SE 0.035), and for ␮g of ATNCs/d versus
dose of g of meat/d, r ⫽ 0.963, b ⫽ 2.605 (SE 0.419).

DISCUSSION

The inﬂuence of red meat on fecal ATNC excretion has now
been shown in more than 50 healthy male volunteers, all of
whom were studied in this study and four previous studies from
our laboratory in a metabolic suite where diet could be carefully
controlled (17–20). The direction of increase with increasing
meat is consistent in nearly all individuals. Furthermore, Figure 2
shows there is a dose response that occurs at normal levels of
120 g of meat/d in addition to the higher levels of 240 and 420 g/d
published elsewhere (19). Under these controlled conditions, the
dose of red meat was highly predictive of average fecal ATNCs,
with R2 values of 0.97 and 0.96 for concentration and output per
day, respectively. At the higher levels of meat consumption,
concentrations of ATNCs are of the same order of magnitude as

does not change fecal NOC output (17,18,20). In this study, the
nonstarch polysaccharide (ﬁber) contents of the diets were the
same and diet had no effect on fecal weight and mean transit time
(Table 1).

in rat models (29). Endogenous N-nitrosation may thus be the
mechanism behind the increased risk of colorectal cancer from
red meat, but further work is required to establish the geno-
toxicity and carcinogenicity of these compounds present in the
colon, especially when large amounts of red meat are con-
sumed.

Red Meat Consumption and Risk of Stroke in

Swedish Women

Susanna C. Larsson, PhD; Jarmo Virtamo, MD; Alicja Wolk, DMSc

Background and Purpose—High red meat consumption has been associated with increased risk of some cancers and may
also be a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. However, epidemiological studies of red meat consumption in relation
to risk of stroke are very limited. Our objective was to examine the association between red meat consumption and
stroke incidence in the Swedish Mammography Cohort.

Methods—We prospectively followed 34 670 women without cardiovascular disease and cancer at baseline. Participants
completed a self-administered questionnaire on diet and other risk factors for cardiovascular diseases in 1997. Cox
proportional hazards models were used to estimate multivariable-adjusted relative risks (RR) and 95% CI.

Results—During a mean follow-up of 10.4 years, we ascertained 1680 incident cases of stroke, comprising 1310 cerebral
infarction, 154 intracerebral hemorrhage, 79 subarachnoid hemorrhage, and 137 unspecified stroke. Total red meat and
processed meat consumption was associated with a statistically significant increased risk of cerebral infarction, but not
of total stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, or subarachnoid hemorrhage. The multivariable RR of cerebral infarction for
the highest versus the lowest quintile of consumption were 1.22 (95% CI, 1.01–1.46) for red meat and 1.24 (95% CI,
1.04 –1.49) for processed meat. Fresh (unprocessed) meat consumption was not associated with total stroke or with any
stroke subtype.

Conclusion—Findings from this study suggest that red and processed meat consumption may increase the risk of cerebral

infarction in women. (Stroke. 2011;42:324-329.)

Key Words: epidemiology 䡲 meat 䡲 prospective studies 䡲 stroke

High consumption of red meat and/or processed meat has

been associated with increased risk of some cancers1–3
and may also be a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases.3,4
Red meat is a source of saturated fat, cholesterol, and heme
iron and has been positively associated with blood pressure5
and with incidence of hypertension,6,7 the metabolic syn-
drome, and inflammation.8 A recent meta-analysis found that
processed meat consumption was associated with increased
risk of coronary heart disease and type 2 diabetes.4 To date,
only 3 studies have examined red meat consumption in
relation to stroke incidence or mortality, with a positive
association observed in 1 study,9 but not observed in the other
2 studies.10,11

Given the paucity of epidemiological data on red meat
consumption in relation to incidence of stroke, we examined
this association in the Swedish Mammography Cohort, a
population-based prospective cohort of Swedish women.

Methods

Study Population
Details of the Swedish Mammography Cohort have been reported
elsewhere.12 Briefly, the cohort was established between 1987

and 1990, when all women born between 1914 and 1948 who
were living in central Sweden (Va¨stmanland and Uppsala coun-
ties) were mailed questionnaire on diet. In the autumn of 1997,
the 56 030 participants who were still alive and resided in the
study area received a new expanded questionnaire that included
⬇350 items concerning diet and other lifestyle factors; 39 227
women (70%) completed the 1997 questionnaire. Because data on
several potential confounders (eg, smoking, diabetes, hyperten-
sion, and physical activity) were obtained for the first time in
1997, only women who completed the 1997 questionnaire were
included in the present study. We excluded women with an
erroneous or missing national identification number; those with a
history of stroke, coronary heart disease, or cancer before
beginning of follow-up; and those with implausible values for
total energy intake (ie, 3 SDs from the log-transformed mean
energy intake in the cohort). This left 34 670 women age 49 to 83
years for analysis. The study was approved by the Regional
Ethical Review Board at the Karolinska Institutet (Stockholm,
Sweden).

Baseline Data Collection
The 1997 questionnaire included questions on education, weight,
height, cigarette smoking, physical activity, aspirin use, medical
history, family history of myocardial infarction before 60 years,
alcohol consumption, and diet. Body mass index was calculated
by dividing weight in kilograms by the square of height in meters.

*All values are means if not otherwise indicated.
MET, indicates metabolic equivalent of energy expenditure (kcal/kg⫻h).

Pack-years of smoking history were calculated by number of
packs of cigarettes smoked per day multiplied by number of years
smoking. The participants reported their level of activity at work,
home/housework, walking/bicycling, and exercise in the year
before study enrollment. The questionnaire also included ques-
tions on inactivity (watching television/reading) and hours per
day of sleeping and sitting/lying down. The reported time spent at
each activity per day was multiplied by its typical energy
expenditure requirements expressed in metabolic equivalents and
added together to create a metabolic-equivalent hours per day
(24-hour) score.13

Dietary Assessment
Diet was assessed with a 96-item food-frequency questionnaire.
Participants were asked to indicate how often, on average, they
had consumed various foods over the previous year, with 8
predefined frequency categories ranging from “never” to “3 or
more times per day.” For this study, we grouped meats into red
meat, fresh meat, and processed meat. Fresh meat intake was
calculated using frequency of consumption and portion size
information of all types of fresh and minced pork, beef, and veal.
Processed meats included sausages, hot dog, salami, ham, pro-
cessed meat cuts, liver pate´, and blood sausage. Red meat was the
sum of fresh meat and processed meat. Participants were also
questioned about chicken/other poultry consumption.

Case Ascertainment and Follow-Up
Incident cases of first stroke that occurred between January 1, 1998
and December 31, 2008 were ascertained by linkage of the study
cohort with the Swedish Hospital Discharge Registry, which pro-
vides virtually complete coverage of discharges. The International
Classification of Diseases 10th revision (ICD-10) was used to
identify stroke events. Strokes were classified as cerebral infarction
(ICD-10 code I63), intracerebral hemorrhage (I61), subarachnoid
hemorrhage (I60), and unspecified stroke (I64). Data on dates of
death were obtained from the Swedish Death Registry.

Statistical Analysis
Each participant accrued follow-up time from January 1, 1998, until
the date of the first stroke event: death or December 31, 2008,

whichever came first. We used Cox proportional hazard models with
age as the time scale to estimate relative risks (RR) with 95% CI of
stroke by quintiles of red meat consumption. Entry time was defined
as a subject’s age in months at start of follow-up, and exit time was
defined as a subject’s age in months at stroke diagnosis or censoring.
The proportional hazards assumption was tested and was met for all
variables except diabetes. We adjusted for diabetes by stratification
in the Cox model. The multivariable model included the following
variables: smoking status and pack-years of smoking (never; past:
⬍20, 20 –39, or ⱖ40 pack-years; or current: ⬍20, 20 –39, or ⱖ40
pack-years), education (less than high school, high school, or
university), body mass index (⬍20, 20 –24.9, 25–29.9, or ⱖ30
kg/m2), total physical activity (by quartiles), self-reported history of
hypertension (yes or no), aspirin use (yes or no), family history of
myocardial infarction before 60 years of age (yes or no), and intakes
of total energy (kcal/d, as a continuous variable), alcohol (nondrink-
ers,⬍3.4, 3.4 –9.9, or ⱖ10.0 g/d), coffee (⬍1, 1–2, 3– 4, or ⱖ5
cups/d), fish (5 categories), fruit (by quartiles), and vegetables (by
quartiles).

Tests for linear trends across quintiles were conducted by model-
ing red meat consumption as a continuous variable in the model with
the median value of each quintile. We conducted analyses stratified
by age (⬍70 or ⱖ70 years), history of hypertension (yes or no),
smoking (never or ever), body mass index (⬍25 kg/m2 or ⱖ25
kg/m2), and history of diabetes (yes or no) to assess possible effect
modification by these variables. Tests for interaction were performed
using the log likelihood ratio test. Statistical analyses were per-
formed using SAS version 9.1 (SAS Institute Inc.). All probability
values were 2 sided.

Results

During a mean follow-up of 10.4 years, we ascertained
1680 incident strokes, comprising 1310 cerebral infarction,
154 intracerebral hemorrhage, 79 subarachnoid hemor-
rhage, and 137 unspecified stroke. There was ⬎5-fold
difference in mean red meat consumption between the
highest and lowest quintile (Table 1). In general, women in
the highest quintile of red meat consumption were younger
and less likely to have a university education, but were

more likely to have diabetes and a history of hypertension
compared with those in the lowest quintile. Women who
reported high red meat consumption also had higher body
mass index and higher intakes of energy, alcohol, coffee,
fish, fruits, and vegetables.

Red meat consumption was positively associated in a
statistically significant way with risk of cerebral infarction,
but not with total stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, or sub-
arachnoid hemorrhage (Table 2). Compared with women in
the lowest quintile of red meat consumption, the multivari-
able RR of cerebral infarction for women in the highest
quintile was 1.22 (95% CI, 1.01–1.46). Additional adjustment
for intakes of whole grains and dairy foods did not change
results appreciably (highest versus lowest quintile: RR⫽1.23;
95% CI 1.02–1.48). The association between red meat con-
sumption and cerebral
infarction was stronger when we
excluded the first 3 years of follow-up (RR⫽1.35; 95% CI,
1.10 –1.66; P⫽0.005).

When we stratified the analysis by smoking status, red
meat consumption was positively associated with risk of
cerebral infarction among never-smokers (highest versus
lowest quintile: RR⫽1.37; 95% CI, 1.08 –1.79), but not
among ever-smokers (corresponding RR⫽1.07; 95% CI,
0.79 –1.44); a test for interaction was not statistically
significant (P⫽0.16). Likewise, red meat consumption was
positively associated with risk of cerebral
infarction
among women without diabetes (RR⫽1.25; 95% CI, 1.03–
1.52), but not among women with diabetes (RR⫽0.88;
95% CI, 0.44 –1.78), although a test for interaction was not
statistically significant (P⫽0.21). There was a clear dose-
response relationship between red meat consumption and
risk of cerebral infarction among never-smokers without
diabetes (n⫽17 659); the multivariable RRs across quin-

tiles of red meat consumption were 1.00 (reference), 1.27
(95% CI, 1.02–1.57), 1.22 (95% CI, 0.97–1.53), 1.32 (95%
CI, 1.03–1.69), and 1.43 (95% CI, 1.11–1.83) (P⫽0.007).
The association between red meat consumption and stroke
was not modified by age or by hypertension.

To examine more extreme levels of red meat consumption,
we categorized participants into deciles of red meat consump-
tion. Compared with women in the lowest decile of red meat
(⬍25 g/d, mean 15.7 g/d), the multivariable RR of cerebral
infarction for those in the highest decile (ⱖ102 g/d, mean
150.7 g/d) was 1.42 (95% CI, 1.11–1.81). Among never-
smokers without diabetes, the corresponding RR was 1.68
(95% CI, 1.21–2.34).

Consumption of processed meat, but not of fresh meat, was
associated with an increased risk of cerebral
infarction;
however, there was no dose-response relationship (Table 3).
Risk of cerebral infarction was 10% to 28% higher among
women in the highest 4 quintiles of processed meat consump-
tion compared with those in the lowest quintile. We found no
significant associations between fresh meat or processed meat
consumption and risk of intracerebral hemorrhage or sub-
arachnoid hemorrhage (Table 3). Poultry consumption was
not associated with risk of total stroke or of any subtype, but
consumption of poultry in this population was very low
(median 0.5 servings/week).

Discussion

In this prospective cohort of Swedish women, consumption of
red meat and processed meat was associated with an in-
creased risk of cerebral infarction but not of total stroke,
intracerebral hemorrhage, or subarachnoid hemorrhage.
Women who consumed 102 g or more of red meat per day
(highest decile) had a 42% higher risk of cerebral infarction

compared with those who consumed less than 25 g/d (lowest
decile). Among never-smokers without diabetes, those in the
highest decile of red meat consumption had 68% increased
risk of cerebral infarction.

To our knowledge, only 3 previous studies have assessed
the association between red meat consumption and stroke. In
the Nurses’ Health Study, women who consumed ⱖ1 serving
of red and processed meats per day had an RR of ischemic
stroke of 1.86 (95% CI, 0.90 –3.83; P⫽0.005).9 Red meat
consumption was not associated with incidence of ischemic
or hemorrhagic stroke in the Health Professional Follow-up
Study10 or with total stroke mortality in a cohort of Japanese
men and women.11

There are several potential mechanisms whereby red
meat consumption may increase the risk of stroke. Hyper-
tension is the most important risk factor for stroke. In a
prospective study of 28 766 US women,
the risk of
incident hypertension rose with increasing baseline total
red meat consumption.7 Women who consumed 1.5 serv-
ings/d or more of red meat had a statistically significant,
35% higher risk of developing hypertension compared

with those who consumed no red meat. Similarly, in a
cohort of 4304 women and men, red and processed meat
consumption was positively associated with risk of ele-
vated blood pressure.6 Moreover, mean blood concentra-
tions of total cholesterol,
low-density lipoprotein cho-
lesterol, very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and
triglycerides were decreased in persons who substituted
red meat with fish.14,15

Red meat is a major source of bioavailable heme iron.
Iron is a redox-active transitional metal that can catalyze
the formation of hydroxyl radicals, which are powerful
pro-oxidants. Vascular inflammation and monocyte re-
cruitment are initiating events in atherosclerosis that have
been suggested to be caused partly by iron-mediated
oxidative stress. An experimental study showed that the
intracellular iron chelator desferrioxamine inhibited in-
flammation and atherosclerosis in mice, suggesting that
iron may play a role in atherogenesis.16 Elevated iron
stores may impose oxidative injury and have been associ-
ated with inflammation,17,18

also a source of saturated fat and cholesterol. Whether
saturated fat affects markers of vascular function, insulin
resistance, inflammation, or risk of stroke is unclear.23
Dietary cholesterol was not associated with risk of stroke
in 2 prospective studies.24

In this study, processed meat was positively associated
more strongly with risk of cerebral infarction than was
fresh meat. Sodium in processed meats could plausibly
account, in part, for these findings. A reduction in dietary
sodium intake has been shown to decrease significantly
blood pressure in hypertensive individuals.25 A low-
sodium diet has also been found to decrease oxidative
stress and to improve vascular function in salt-sensitive
individuals,26 and a high sodium intake may promote
vascular stiffness.27 Several prospective studies have ob-
served a positive association between processed meat
consumption and risk of type 2 diabetes,4,28,29 which is a
risk factor for cerebral infarction.

Strengths of

this study include its prospective and
population-based design and nearly complete follow-up of
study participants by linkage with population-based Swed-
ish registers. Although our study was much larger with
regard to the number of incident stroke cases compared
with previous studies, the number of cases of intracerebral
infarction and subarachnoid hemorrhage was still rela-
tively small; this leads to limited statistical power and
unstable risk estimates. Because diet was assessed using a
self-administered questionnaire, some measurement error
in assessing meat consumption was inevitable. Given the
prospective design, any measurement errors are likely to
be nondifferential and would have tended to attenuate the
association between red meat consumption and risk of
cerebral infarction. Another limitation is that our assess-
ment of medical history and other covariates was based on
self-report. It is possible that women with high consump-
tion of
increased risk of cerebral
infarction because of other unhealthy habits and behaviors.
However, our findings persisted after adjustment for a
wide variety of potential confounders,
including other
dietary factors. Women with high red meat consumption
reported higher consumption of fish, fruits, and vegetables,
which have been inversely associated with risk of
stroke.30,31 Thus, any residual confounding because of
imprecise measurement of those food items would tend to
attenuate rather than exaggerate the observed positive
association between red meat consumption and stroke.
Moreover, results persisted and were even stronger among
never-smokers and women without diabetes.

red meat were at

In conclusion, results from this prospective study of
women suggest that consumption of red and processed
meats may increase risk of cerebral
infarction. These
findings merit confirmation in additional large prospective
studies and in experimental studies on possible biological
mechanisms.

Abstract

Cancer prevention guidelines recommend limiting intake of red meat and avoiding processed meat; however, few studies

have been conducted on the effects of speciﬁc red meat subtypes on colon cancer or rectal cancer risk. The study aim was

to evaluate associations between intake of red meat and its subtypes, processed meat, ﬁsh, and poultry and risk for colon

cancer or rectal cancer in the Danish Diet, Cancer and Health cohort study. We also evaluated whether ﬁsh or poultry

should replace red meat intake to prevent colon cancer or rectal cancer. During follow-up (13.4 y), 644 cases of colon

cancer and 345 cases of rectal cancer occurred among 53,988 participants. Cox proportional hazards models were used to

compute incidence rate ratio (IRRs) and 95% CIs. No associations were found between intake of red meat, processed

meat, ﬁsh, or poultry and risk for colon cancer or rectal cancer. The risk associated with speciﬁc red meat subtypes

depended on the animal of origin and cancer subsite; thus, the risk for colon cancer was signiﬁcantly elevated for higher

intake of lamb [IRRper 5g/d = 1.07 (95% CI: 1.02–1.13)], whereas the risk for rectal cancer was elevated for higher intake of
pork [IRRper 25g/d = 1.18 (95% CI: 1.02–1.36)]. Substitution of ﬁsh for red meat was associated with a signiﬁcantly lower
risk for colon cancer [IRRper 25g/d = 0.89 (95% CI: 0.80–0.99)] but not rectal cancer. Substitution of poultry for red meat did
not reduce either risk. This study suggests that the risks for colon cancer and potentially for rectal cancer differ according

to the speciﬁc red meat subtype consumed. J. Nutr. 143: 464–472, 2013.

Introduction

In 2007, the World Cancer Research Fund/American Institute
for Cancer Research (WCRF/AICR)6 concluded that red and
processed meat were ‘‘convincing’’ risk factors for colorectal
cancer (1). This expert conclusion is supported by the results of
an updated dose-response meta-analysis of epidemiological
studies published up to March 2011, which showed signiﬁcant
17 and 18% higher risks for colorectal cancer with red and
processed meat, respectively, when analyzed separately for every
100 g/d increase in intake (2). Based on the current evidence, the
WCRF/AICR recommends limiting the intake of red meat and

avoiding processed meat (1). The recommendation, however,
makes no distinction between different types of red meat (i.e.,
beef, pork, veal, and lamb).

In contrast to red and processed meat (which is mainly based
on red meat), white meat (i.e., ﬁsh and poultry) has not been
associated with increased risks for colorectal cancer (3). This
difference was proposed to be due to endogenous formation of
intestinal carcinogenic N-nitroso compounds (NOCs) (4). In
controlled dietary intervention studies, intake of red meat, but
not white meat, has been shown to increase endogenous formation
of NOCs in a dose-response manner (5). It has been suggested that
this effect is mediated by heme iron, which is highly abundant in
red meat (6). Although all red meat contains heme iron, there are
species variations: the highest amounts have been reported in beef
and lamb and lower levels in pork and veal (7). Thus, if the
potential carcinogenic effect of red meat is driven by heme iron,
the risk might vary according to red meat subtype. Individual
associations between speciﬁc red meat subtypes (e.g., beef and
pork) and risks for colon and rectal cancer have, however, been
evaluated in only 3 previous prospective studies, which gave
conﬂicting results (8–10). In addition to heme iron, exogenously
formed NOCs in processed meat and compounds created by
cooking of meat, including heterocyclic amines (HCAs) and

polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), offer further potential
underlying biological mechanisms (11,12).

An effect modiﬁcation by other lifestyle factors on the
associations between red and processed meat and risk for colon
and rectal cancers has been hypothesized. In some studies, stronger
positive associations were found between either red meat intake or
heme iron intake and colorectal cancer risk among alcohol drinkers
(13,14). Also, the association between red and processed meat and
colorectal cancer risk was less pronounced in people with a higher
intake of dietary ﬁber (10).

Within the Danish Diet, Cancer and Health study, we aimed
to examine associations between intake of red meat and its
subtypes (i.e., beef, pork, veal, and lamb), processed meat, ﬁsh,
and poultry and the risks for colon and rectal cancer and
investigated whether the associations were modiﬁed by alcohol
or dietary ﬁber intake. Furthermore, because different types of
meat may contribute to different amounts of potential meat-
derived carcinogens, e.g., heme iron, we also examined the effect
of replacing red meat with ﬁsh or poultry and the effect of the
mutual replacements between speciﬁc red meat subtypes on the
risks for colon and rectal cancer.

Subjects and Methods

Study population. Diet, Cancer and Health is a large, ongoing,
prospective cohort study that was designed to primarily investigate the
relations among diet, lifestyle, and the incidence of cancer (15). Between
1993 and 1997, 160,725 Danish men and women were invited to
participate. The study inclusion criteria were: age 50–64 y, living in the
greater Copenhagen and Aarhus areas, born in Denmark, and not
registered with a cancer diagnosis in the Danish Cancer Registry (16,17).
Invitees were identiﬁed by the unique 10-digit identiﬁcation number
allocated to every Danish citizen by the Danish Civil Registration System
(18). Of those invited, 57,053 (27,178 men and 29,875 women) agreed
to participate (35.5%). They completed 2 questionnaires on diet and
lifestyle, provided biological samples (e.g., blood samples), and under-
went anthropometric measurements. Approval for this study was obtained
from the regional ethical committees on human studies in Copenhagen and
Aarhus and by the Danish Data Protection Agency.

For the present analysis, people were excluded if they had a previous
cancer diagnosis (because of delayed registration in the Danish Cancer
Registry) before baseline (n = 571), if they had not ﬁlled in a lifestyle
questionnaire (n = 37), or if information was missing on the variables
(meat exposures or confounders) considered in the analyses (n = 2456).
After all exclusions, the cohort comprised 53,988 participants (25,832
men and 28,156 women).

Data assessment. Habitual diet during the 12 mo before the study
baseline was determined from a 192-item FFQ sent to each cohort
participant by mail before their visit to 1 of 2 established study centers in
Copenhagen and Aarhus. The development and validation of this FFQ
were previously described (19,20). Dietary consumption was assessed in
12 categories of predeﬁned responses, ranging from ‘‘never’’ to ‘‘eight
times or more per day.’’ Daily intakes of foods and nutrients were
calculated for each participant with the software program FoodCalc
(21). Standard gender-speciﬁc portion sizes speciﬁcally developed for the
cohort population were used (22,23).

Of the 192 foods and recipes in the FFQ, 63 covered intake of meat
items and meat dishes. The exposure variables considered for the present
analysis were intake in grams per day of red meat, processed meat, ﬁsh,
and poultry. Red meat consisted of fresh and minced beef, veal, pork,
lamb, and offal; we further subdivided red meat into 4 subgroups
reﬂecting their animal of origin: beef, pork, veal, and lamb. Intake of
processed meat was calculated by adding up intake of red meat that had
undergone some form of processing, such as salting, smoking, or curing;
this included bacon, smoked or cooked ham, other cold cuts, salami,
frankfurter, Cumberland sausage, and liver p^at´e. Processed meat was

further subgrouped into sausages, cold cuts, and liver p^at´e. Because
intake of bacon was not speciﬁed in the FFQ, it was estimated from
recipes; bacon could therefore not be considered a separate exposure.
As processed meat was mostly pork, we were unable to differentiate
processed meat by origin. Fish comprised all fresh and processed ﬁsh.
Poultry was assessed as the sum of chicken and turkey.

The lifestyle questionnaire contained detailed questions on several
social factors, health status, reproductive factors, and lifestyle habits.
From this questionnaire, we extracted the following information: years
of schooling, use of hormone replacement therapy, sports activity, smoking
status, alcohol consumption, and use of nonsteroidal antiinﬂammatory
drugs (NSAIDs). The waist circumference of all participants was measured
by trained health professionals at the study clinic visit.

During the visit to the study clinic, the 2 self-administered question-
naires were processed by optical scanning and checked for missing values,
so that unclear information could be clariﬁed with each participant. A
few missing values were accepted in the lifestyle questionnaire but not in
the FFQ.

Follow-up and case ascertainment. The personal
identiﬁcation
numbers of all cohort members were linked to the Danish Civil Registration
System (18) to obtain information on vital status and emigration. Each
study participant was followed up for colon or rectal cancer from the date
of entry into the study, taken as the date of visit to the study center, until the
date of diagnosis of any cancer (except nonmelanoma skin cancer), date of
death, date of emigration, or December 31, 2009. Loss to follow-up was
minor (0.7%). Information on cancer incidence was obtained by linkage to
the Danish Cancer Registry (16,17), which contains data on all cancers
diagnosed in Denmark. The deﬁnitions of colon and rectal cancer were
those of the 10th Revision of the International Classiﬁcation of Diseases.
Cancers of the colon were tumors with codes C18.0–C18.9 and C19;
proximal colon tumors included the cecum, appendix, ascending colon,
hepatic ﬂexure, transverse colon, and splenic ﬂexure (C18.1–C18.5),
whereas distal colon tumors included those in the descending (C18.6)
and sigmoid (C18.7) colon and at the rectosigmoid junction (C19.9).
Colon tumors at overlapping lesions (C18.8) and colon tumors not
otherwise speciﬁed (C18.9) were grouped with all colon cancers only.
Rectal cancers were tumors of the rectum (C20); anal canal tumors were
not considered in this study.

Statistical analyses. Analyses of the relations between red meat and its
subtypes, processed meat and its subtypes, ﬁsh, and poultry and colon
and rectal cancer rates were based on Cox proportional hazards models
(including time-dependent variables), with age as the time axis to ensure
that the estimation procedure was based on comparisons of people of the
same age, which allowed for age adjustment to prevent confounding by
age. The other time variable, time under study, was included as a time-
dependent variable modeled by a linear spline with boundaries at 1, 2,
and 3 y after entry into the study cohort to allow the hazard rate to
change with time (24). Initially, separate analyses were done for men and
women, but because no substantial differences emerged, we tested
whether the results could be presented for both genders combined. Tests
for interaction between intake of meat (i.e., red meat, processed meat,
poultry, and ﬁsh) and gender were performed by testing whether the
slopes differed signiﬁcantly by estimating separate slopes for intake of
meat in the 2 categories of gender. This model was compared with a
model estimating a single, common slope for intake of meat by using the
likelihood ratio test. Because the tests for interaction between intake of
meat and gender were not signiﬁcant (all P-interaction > 0.11), the data
were combined. In all analyses, however, stratiﬁcation according to
gender was performed so that the basic (underlying) hazards were gender
speciﬁc.

Models evaluating the individual associations between intake of red
meat and its subtypes, processed meat and its subtypes, ﬁsh, and poultry
and risk for colon or rectal cancer are presented with and without
adjustment for potential colon and rectal cancer risk factors and meat
exposures mutually adjusted for each other. The following baseline
values of potential colon and rectal cancer risk factors were included as
covariates in the adjusted models: waist circumference (cm; continuous);
schooling [low (#7 y), medium (8–10 y), and high ($11 y)]; smoking

status (never, former, or current smoker); hormone replacement therapy
status in women only (never, former, or current user); sports activities
[entered as 2 variables: an indicator variable (nonactive/active), in which
nonactive was deﬁned as reporting no hours of sports activities per week
and active was reporting sports activities (the lowest possible reported
activity level being half an hour), and a linear variable (number of hours
per week; continuous)]; alcohol intake [entered as 2 variables: an indicator
variable (alcohol abstainer: yes/no) separating those reporting no intake of
alcohol from those reporting drinking any alcohol, and a linear variable
(g/d; continuous)]; NSAID intake (nonuser or user); dietary ﬁber intake
(g/d; continuous); and total energy (kJ/d; continuous) by the standard
method. Use of the nutrient density method to adjust for total energy (i.e.,
adjusting dietary variables for total energy) resulted in similar risk estimates
(data not shown). Further adjustment for saturated fat intake and fruit
and vegetable intake did not change the risk estimates and these variables
were therefore not included in the ﬁnal adjusted model.

We further tested for interactions between intake of red meat, processed
meat, ﬁsh, and poultry and alcohol intake and dietary ﬁber intake (total
and source speciﬁc). This was done by testing whether the slopes for the
intake of meat signiﬁcantly differed by estimating separate slopes for the
intake of meat in 3 groups of either alcohol or dietary ﬁber intake. This
model was compared with another model estimating a single common
slope for the intakes of meat by the likelihood ratio test.

Because different types of meats may contribute different amounts of
potential meat-derived carcinogens, e.g., heme iron, we further estimated
the risks for colon and rectal cancer associated with replacing red meat
with either ﬁsh or poultry and after replacing one red meat subtype with
another. Cox proportional hazards models were ﬁtted, all including
intake of total meat, the meat exposure of interest, and all other meat
except the meat substituting for (i.e., kept out of the model). All models
were adjusted for the same covariates described above.

In all models, red meat and its subtypes, processed meat and its
subtypes, ﬁsh, and poultry were included as either continuous or categorical
variables. When they were included as continuous variables, the increments
used were 50 g/d for red meat, 25 g/d for processed meat, ﬁsh, poultry, beef,
and pork, 10 g/d for sausages and cold cuts, and 5 g/d for veal, lamb, and
liver p^at´e intakes. When they were included as categorical variables (tertiles
or quartiles), the categorization was based on the intake distribution among
cases. Use of a categorization based on the intake distribution in the entire
cohort to deﬁne categorical variables resulted in similar risk estimates (data
not shown). Lamb, sausage, and liver p^at´e were eaten by only a relatively
small fraction of the cohort, and a large fraction had zero consumption
of these speciﬁc subtypes. For these items, we therefore created indicator
variables reﬂecting nonconsumption.

The linearity of all quantitative variables (exposure and covariate
variables) was graphically evaluated in linear spline models with 3 or 9
boundaries placed at the quartiles or deciles among cases (24). None of
the associations showed signs of deﬂection, and quantitative variables
could be entered linearly into the Cox models (25).

Two-sided 95% CIs for the incidence rate ratios (IRRs) were calculated
based on WaldÕs test of the Cox regression parameter, i.e., on the log rate
ratio scale. The procedure PHREG in SAS (release 9.1; SAS Institute) on a
TextPad platform was used for the statistical analyses.

Results

During a median follow-up of 13.4 y (5th–95th percentile: 4.6–
15.0 y), 644 incident cases of colon cancer and 345 of rectal
cancer were diagnosed. The colon cancer cases comprised 266
cancers of the proximal part of the colon, 328 cancers of the
distal part, and 50 with no deﬁnitive site information. The baseline
characteristics across intake groups of red meat for men and
women separately are shown in Table 1. Both men and women
with the highest reported level of red meat consumption were
more likely to be current smokers, NSAID users, have a higher
waist circumference, and consume more dietary ﬁber and total
energy than those in the lowest intake group; furthermore, men
in the highest intake group consumed more alcohol and women

466 Egeberg et al.

in the highest intake group were less likely to have a high
education and to be physically active than those in the lowest
intake groups.

Table 2 presents the IRRs (95% CI) for colon and rectal
cancers associated with intake of meat. Intake of red meat was
not associated with colon cancer risk. In the analyses of red meat
subtypes, higher intake of lamb was signiﬁcantly associated with
a higher risk for colon cancer, when comparing the highest to the
lowest intake group [adjusted IRRGroup 3 vs. Group 1 for lamb =
1.35 (95% CI: 1.07–1.71); P-trend = 0.01]. This association
persisted in the continuous analysis; for an increment in intake
of 5 g/d of lamb, the adjusted IRR for colon cancer was 1.07
(95% CI: 1.02–1.13). An elevated colon cancer risk was observed
among participants in the highest compared to the lowest intake
group of beef [adjusted IRRGroup 4 vs. Group 1 for beef = 1.30
(95% CI: 1.00–1.70)]; however, the P-trend was not signiﬁcant
(P-trend = 0.33) and there was no association in the continuous
model. In addition, intake of neither pork nor veal was associated
with risk for colon cancer. There were no consistent associations
between intake of processed meat overall or processed meat
subtypes and risk for colon cancer. Furthermore, there was no
evidence of an association between intake of poultry [adjusted
IRRper 25g/d = 1.04 (95% CI: 0.93–1.15)] or of ﬁsh [adjusted
IRRper 25g/d = 0.93 (95% CI: 0.85–1.01)] and colon cancer risk.
Analyses with continuous variables were also performed for
the 2 colon cancer subsites: proximal and distal. No association
was found between intake of overall red meat, overall processed
meat or its subtypes, poultry, or ﬁsh and risk for either proximal
or distal colon cancer (data not shown). For proximal colon
cancer, a higher risk was seen with each increment of intake of 5
g/d of veal [adjusted IRRper 5g/d = 1.14 (95% CI: 1.03–1.26)].
Intake of lamb was signiﬁcantly associated with a higher risk for
distal colon cancer, with an adjusted IRR of 1.11 (95% CI: 1.04–
1.18) for each increment of intake of 5 g/d.

Overall red meat intake was not associated with risk for
rectal cancer. Both intake of beef and pork affected the risk but
in opposite directions: a higher intake of beef was signiﬁcantly
associated with a lower risk for rectal cancer [adjusted IRRper
25g/d = 0.83 (95% CI: 0.70–0.98)], while a higher intake of pork
was signiﬁcantly associated with a higher risk [adjusted IRRper
25g/d = 1.18 (95% CI: 1.02–1.37)]. No association was found
between rectal cancer risk and intake of processed meat or its
subtypes, ﬁsh, or poultry (Table 2).

Neither intake of alcohol nor total dietary ﬁber modiﬁed the
associations between red meat, processed meat, poultry, or ﬁsh
and risks for colon and rectal cancer (all P-interaction > 0.19).
The association between processed meat and colon cancer risk
tended to differ by cereal ﬁber intake (P-interaction = 0.06), the
risk for colon cancer being elevated only among participants
with a low intake (>0 to #8 g/d), but not among those with
higher intakes (>8 g/d). Thus, participants with a low cereal ﬁber
intake had a signiﬁcant, 13% (95% CI: 1.01–1.28) higher risk
for colon cancer per each increment of 25-g/d intake of processed
meat. A higher intake of ﬁsh was associated with a signiﬁcantly
lower risk for colon cancer among people with a low fruit ﬁber
intake [>0 to #2 g/d; adjusted IRRper 25 g/d = 0.77 (95% CI:
0.65–0.90)] but not among those with a higher fruit ﬁber intake
(>2 g/d; P-interaction = 0.01). Dietary ﬁber intake from either
source did not affect the risk for rectal cancer associated with red
meat, processed meat, poultry, or ﬁsh intake (all P-interaction >
0.14).

rectal cancer from the substitution models, representing the risks
for colon or rectal cancer associated with a higher intake of one

Discussion

In this prospective cohort, no signiﬁcant associations between
intake of red meat, processed meat, ﬁsh, or poultry and the risks
for colon or rectal cancer risk were shown. With regard to speciﬁc
red meat subtypes, we found signiﬁcant positive associations
between intake of lamb and risk for colon cancer and intake of
pork and risk for rectal cancer, whereas a higher intake of beef
was associated with a signiﬁcantly lower risk for rectal cancer.
This study also suggests that replacing red meat with ﬁsh, rather

than poultry, is associated with a signiﬁcantly lower risk for
colon cancer.

The strengths of this study include its prospective design, the
availability of comprehensive information about the intake of a
wide range of meats, and detailed information about potential
confounding factors. Follow-up was 99.3%. The potential
limitations include the small numbers of cases of proximal and
distal colon cancer and rectal cancer compared with the consid-
erable number of colon cancer cases. Furthermore, the partic-
ipation rate was 35.5% and participants reported a higher
socioeconomic position than nonparticipants (15); therefore, the
study results may not apply to the entire source population. The
participant self-selection may have resulted in a more homoge-
neous study population with less variation in dietary intake,
including meat, than the source population. Although the FFQ
was validated (19), dietary intake based on FFQs is by deﬁnition
affected by measurement errors and could contribute to expo-
sure misclassiﬁcation. In this study, the problem would have been
of particular concern for meats eaten in small quantities and
sporadically, such as lamb, veal, sausages, and liver p^at ´e. In
addition, dietary intake was assessed only once, at study baseline.
Although we would not expect middle-aged participants to make
major changes in their dietary habits over time, a single FFQ may
not represent long-term diet; therefore, the lack of multiple dietary
assessments during follow-up might have resulted in some degree

of exposure misclassiﬁcation. Such errors are probably non-
differential (due to the study design) and might attenuate true
associations. Lastly, we cannot rule out the possibility of residual
confounding despite our attempts to adjust for several suggested
risk factors for colon and rectal cancer.

We observed no association between intake of red or processed
meat and risk for colon or rectal cancer. These ﬁndings are in
contrast to those of a study within the European Prospective
Investigation into Nutrition and Cancer (EPIC) that included data
from our Danish cohort (only 18% of our cases) and a recent
dose-response meta-analysis of 21 prospective studies (2). In their
meta-analysis, Chan et al. (2) found that intake of red and
processed meat was associated with signiﬁcantly higher (by 17
and 24%, respectively) risks for colon cancer per every 100-g/d
increment in intake; the risks for rectal cancer were elevated
with intake of both red and processed meat, but the associations
did not reach signiﬁcance. Possible explanations for the different
ﬁndings of our study and others may relate to differences in the
study populations, the grouping of meats, or the range of meat
intake. Most of the studies included in the meta-analysis by
Chan et al. (2) were conducted in the US. In the largest cohort,
the NIH-AARP study, in which a positive association was found
between intake of red meat (including processed red meat) and
risk for colorectal cancer, the highest category of daily intake was
61.6 g/1000 kcal (median, ;123 g/d) (12). This is considerably

lower than the intake of our cohort (medians in the highest intake
category, 139 g/d red meat and 57 g/d processed meat). Therefore,
our ﬁndings of no associations are unlikely to be related to low
intakes, although the narrow variation in intakes may be implicated.
Intake of ﬁsh or poultry has not been associated with higher
risks for colon or rectal cancer (1,3,26), consistent with our
ﬁndings. The higher heme iron content of red meat represents
one main difference between red meat and ﬁsh and poultry. Heme
iron is thought to stimulate endogenous formation of NOCs (6),
which are suspected carcinogens (4). Furthermore, heme iron
induces cytotoxicity of colonic content and compensatory hyper-
proliferation of the colonic epithelium (27,28); it also induces
colorectal cancer in rodents (29), may act as a prooxidant, and
may catalyze lipid peroxidation and DNA damage (30). Heme
iron intake has been positively associated with the risk for colorectal
cancer in most (12–14,31) but not all studies (32,33). Although
we found no association between intake of all red meat and risk
for colon cancer, a higher intake of lamb was consistently related
to a higher risk, and an elevated risk for colon cancer was suggested
for high beef consumption. Because heme iron amounts differ in
red meat subtypes, being highest in lamb and beef and lowest in
pork and veal (7), these ﬁndings support a possible role of heme
iron. Few other studies have examined associations of risk with
speciﬁc red meat subtypes. The Netherlands Cohort Study
suggested that intake of beef was related to a higher risk for
colon cancer and intake of pork to a lower risk (9). No association
with beef or pork intake and colon cancer risk was reported in a
Japanese cohort study; however, the very low meat consumption
of the participants might explain this unexpected ﬁnding (8). In
the EPIC study (10), a signiﬁcantly higher risk for colorectal
cancer was found for participants in the group with the highest
intake of pork and a positive association with lamb consumption
was suggested; no association was found with beef or veal
consumption. In the EPIC study, however, the effects of red meat
subtypes were not examined by colorectal cancer subsite or by
country, only EPIC-wide (10). Whereas intake of pork was
associated with a signiﬁcantly higher risk for rectal cancer in our
study, intake of beef was associated with a signiﬁcantly lower
risk. The ﬁnding for beef was unexpected, because beef belongs
to the red meat category not considered preventable. Because we
conducted multiple tests, we cannot rule out chance; however,
this applies to all our results. Also, as mentioned previously, the
small number of rectal cancer cases might have reduced the
power of this analysis. Nevertheless, the risk factors for colon
and rectal cancer may vary, because these structures arise from
different embryonic tissue and serve different functions (34).
Besides heme iron, any effect of meat on risk for colon and
rectal cancer could be associated with exposure to exogenous
NOCs, HCAs, or PAHs (11,12). Whereas exogenous NOCs are
derived mainly from processed meat, HCAs and PAHs occur as a
result of cooking meat at high temperature, over an open ﬂame,
or by certain cooking and smoking methods applied to processed
meat (35–38). We were unable to consider associations between
HCAs and PAHs and risks for colon and rectal cancer, because
we had no data on meat cooking; however, other data indicate
that our cohort might have had high exposure to these compounds.
In an analysis of 24-h dietary recalls by a subsample of our cohort
(7%), high-temperature meat-cooking methods (i.e., frying,
grilling, and barbecuing) were used for 43% of meat and ﬁsh
eaten (39), whereas the reported frequencies in other Europeans
populations range from 11.5 to 46.5% (39). Thus, our overall
ﬁndings are unlikely to be explained by the meat cooking method,
if the mechanism by which red meat affects the risk for colon and
rectal cancer is due to HCAs and PAHs.

The WCRF/AICR recommends dietary changes that focus on
increasing the intake of other sources of meat, such as ﬁsh and
poultry, to prevent cancer (1). Our ﬁnding that the risk for colon
cancer is lowered when red meat is replaced with ﬁsh is in line
with the results of previous prospective studies (40–42). In 2 of
these, the ratio of higher red meat to lower combined poultry
and ﬁsh intake was associated with a higher risk for colorectal
cancer (41,42). Another study found that a 10-g (per 1000 kcal)
higher intake of white meat combined with an equal lower intake
of red meat intake was associated with lower risks for both colon
and rectal cancer (40).

In conclusion, we found no association between intake of red
meat, processed meat, ﬁsh, or poultry and the risk for colon or
rectal cancer. Our study suggests, however, that different types
of red meat differ in their associations with colon cancer risk and
potentially also rectal cancer risk. Further evaluations in larger
studies should be made of the potential associations between types
of red meat and the risks for cancers of the colon and rectum. The
ﬁnding of a lower risk for colon cancer when ﬁsh replaced red
meat underscores the importance of the recommendation of the
WCRF/AICR to replace red meat with other meat sources in the
diet for cancer prevention.

ABSTRACT Emerging evidence suggests that diet quality indices may serve as prognostic indicators of disease.
However, the ability of these indices to predict breast cancer risk has not been evaluated previously. We assessed
the association between several diet quality scores and the risk of breast cancer in postmenopausal women. The
indices we used were the Healthy Eating Index (HEI), Alternate Healthy Eating Index (AHEI), Diet Quality Index-
Revised (DQI-R), Recommended Food Score (RFS), and the alternate Mediterranean Diet Score (aMed). We
calculated diet quality indices from dietary information collected in FFQ administered 5 times between 1984 and 1998
among women in the Nurses’ Health Study cohort. Relative risks (RR) were computed using Cox proportional
hazards models and adjusted for known risk factors for breast cancer. Separate analyses were conducted for
estrogen receptor positive (ER1) and negative (ERÿ) tumors. Between 1984 and 2002, we documented 3580 cases
of breast cancer, of which 2367 were ER1, and 575 were ERÿ. We did not observe any association between the diet
quality indices and total or ER1 breast cancer risk. However, for ERÿ breast cancer, after adjusting for potential
confounders, the RR comparing highest to lowest quintiles were 0.78 (95% CI ¼ 0.59–1.04, P for trend ¼ 0.01) for the
AHEI, 0.69 (95% CI ¼ 0.51–0.94, P for trend ¼ 0.003) for the RFS, and 0.79 (95% CI ¼ 0.60–1.03, P for trend ¼ 0.03)
for the aMed. These observations appeared to be the result of an inverse association (P for trend ¼ 0.01) with the
vegetable component of the scores. We conclude that women who scored high in AHEI, RFS, and aMed had a lower
risk of ERÿ breast cancer. The HEI and DQI-R appeared to be of limited value in predicting breast cancer risk. J.

Several diet quality indices have been developed to evaluate
the healthfulness of individual diets. These indices are usually
based on established nutrient requirements and well-publicized
dietary guidelines. However, diet indices have not been tested
extensively in their ability to predict the risk of chronic dis-
eases. Previous studies focused on diet quality in relation to
total mortality or incidence of broad categories of diseases (1–
3). A strategy that combines all cancers together may not
provide full insight because both dietary risk factors and the
strength of association often differ by cancer site. For breast
cancer, there are few established dietary risk factors other than
alcohol (4), indicating that individual dietary factors in adult
life have weak if any effect on breast cancer risk. It is therefore
worthwhile to examine whether overall diet patterns affect risk,
perhaps through additive or interactive effects of dietary
behaviors not captured in studies of single nutrients.

We examined prospectively the association between several
diet quality indices and the risk of breast cancer in postmeno-
pausal women. The scores used in this study were Healthy
Eating Index (HEI),3 Alternate Healthy Eating Index (AHEI),
Diet Quality Index-Revised (DQIR), Recommended Food Score
(RFS), and the alternate Mediterranean Diet Score (aMed).
We also considered breast cancer tumors according to estrogen
receptor (ER) status because evidence suggests that risk may
vary by ER status (5).

health-related information (6). Since 1976, questionnaires have been
sent biennially to update exposures and disease outcome status.
Follow-up was complete for .95% of the potential person time up to
2002. In 1980, the participants completed a 61-item FFQ. In 1984, the
FFQ was expanded to 116 items. Similar FFQ were sent to the women
in 1986, 1990, 1994, and 1998. We considered 1984 as baseline for
this analysis because the expanded number of food items on the longer
questionnaire was critical in calculating diet quality scores. The NHS is
approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Brigham and
Women’s Hospital, Boston, MA.

For the present analysis, women were included if they completed
the 1984 FFQ with ,70 missing items and had a total energy intake
range (as calculated from the FFQ) between 2060 and 14420 kJ/d (500
and 3500 kcal/d). Women with a history of cancer, except for non-
melanoma skin cancers, were excluded. Thus, we included 71,058 women
in this analysis with follow-up for up to 18 y, from 1984 to 2002.

Assessment of dietary intake. Dietary intake information was
collected by FFQ designed to assess average food intake over the
previous year. A standard portion size was given for each food item.
Cohort members were asked to choose from 9 possible frequency of
consumption responses, ranging from ‘‘never’’ to ‘‘more than 6 times
a day’’ for each food. Total energy intake was calculated by summing
the energy intake from all foods. For this analysis, we used information
from the FFQ administered in 1984, 1986, 1990, 1994, and 1998.
Previous validation studies among members of the NHS cohort
revealed good correlations between nutrients assessed by the FFQ and
multiple weeks of food records completed over the previous year (7).
For example, correlation coefﬁcients between the 1986 FFQ and diet
records obtained in 1986 were 0.68 for saturated fat, 0.76 for vitamin
C, and 0.73 for dietary cholesterol. The mean correlation coefﬁcient
between frequencies of intake of 55 foods from 2 FFQ 12 mo apart was
0.57 (8).

Scoring criteria for each diet quality index were described in detail
elsewhere. A brief description is presented in the Appendix. For each
index, a higher score represents a more healthful diet. Calculation of
the HEI was based on criteria set in The Healthy Eating Index Final
Report and adapted to this cohort by McCullough et al. (2,9). Brieﬂy,
the HEI contains 10 components consisting of grains, vegetables, fruit,
milk, meat, total fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, sodium, and diet
variety. These criteria reﬂect recommendations based on the USDA
Food Guide Pyramid (10) and the 1995 Dietary Guidelines for
Americans (11). Possible scores from each component ranged from 0 to
10, depending on level of intake, with a possible total score of 100 for
the HEI. The AHEI scoring criteria (12) differed from those of the
original HEI; it addressed quality within food groups by removing
potatoes from vegetables, and including fruit, nuts and soy, white/red
meat ratio, trans fat and the polyunsaturated:saturated fat ratio, cereal
ﬁber, and adding long-term multivitamin use, and alcohol intake. The
possible score for the multivitamin component was either 2.5 or 7.5 to
avoid overweighting. The AHEI was based on 9 items, with a maxi-
mum possible score of 87.5.

The RFS was developed by Kant et al. (1) and adapted by
McCullough et al. (12) for our FFQ. The RFS focused on fruits,
vegetables, whole grains, lean meats or meat alternates, and low-fat
dairy products. Participants received 1 point for each recommended
food consumed at least weekly. Based on the length of our FFQ, the
maximum possible scores were 49–56, depending on the version of the
FFQ.

The DQIR score was based on methods developed by Haines et al.
(13). and adapted for our FFQ by Newby et al. (14). Brieﬂy, the DQIR
consists of 10 components that measure intake of several food groups
and nutrients as well as diet diversity and moderation. These com-
ponents included grains, vegetables, fruit, total fat, saturated fat,
cholesterol, iron, calcium, diet diversity, and moderation in added fat
and sugar. The range of possible scores for each component was 0–10
points, depending on the level of intake; the maximum possible DQIR
score was 100 points.

The aMed score was based on a Mediterranean diet scale by
Trichopoulou et al. (15,16). The original score was based on the intake
of 9 items: vegetables, legumes, fruits and nuts, dairy, cereals, meat and
meat products, ﬁsh, alcohol, and the monounsaturated:saturated fat
ratio. Participants with intake above the median intake received 1

point; otherwise they received 0 points. Meat and dairy product
consumption below the median received 1 point. We modiﬁed the
original scale by excluding potato products from the vegetable group,
separating fruits and nuts into 2 groups, eliminating the dairy group,
including whole-grain products only, including only red and processed
meats for the meat group, and assigning 1 point for alcohol intake
between 5 and 15 g/d. These modiﬁcations were based on dietary
patterns and eating behaviors that have been consistently associated
with lower risks of chronic disease in clinical and epidemiological
studies. The score range for the aMed was 0–9.

Case ascertainment. For this analysis, we used incident breast
cancers obtained by self-report in the biennial questionnaire post-1984
to 2002. Permission was then obtained to review medical records for
conﬁrmation for all self-reported cases; 99% of self-reported cases were
conﬁrmed by medical records. We also included 1% of cases conﬁrmed
by the participants. Estrogen and progesterone receptor status was
obtained from pathology reports and each receptor was classiﬁed as
positive, negative, or uncertain. Deaths were reported by the postal
service, family members, or by searching the National Death Index. In
this study, we included only postmenopausal breast cancer cases to
reduce potential etiologic heterogeneity.

Statistical analysis. To reduce random within-person variation
and best represent long-term dietary intake, we calculated cumulative
averages of diet quality scores from each of the FFQ. For example,
scores in 1984 were used to predict breast cancer occurrence from
1984 to 1986, and the average of 1984 and 1986 intake was used to
model cancer risk in 1986–1988, and so on (17). We also used baseline
(1984) diet as a predictor of breast cancer risk to assess the inﬂuence of
long-term diet.

We used the Cox proportional hazards model to assess associations
between dietary quality scores and the risk of breast cancer between
1984 and 2002. The regression analyses were adjusted for age, smoking
status (never, past, current smoker up to 14 cigarettes/d, 15–24
cigarettes/d, 251 cigarettes/d), BMI (5 categories), multivitamin (yes/
no), energy intake (quintiles), physical activity in metabolic equivalent
(MET) h/wk (quintiles), family history of breast cancer (yes/no),
personal history of benign breast disease (yes/no), age at menopause,
and use of postmenopausal hormone therapy (13 categories), BMI at
age 18 (4 categories), and weight change since age 18 y (7 categories).
Alcohol intake (4 categories) was adjusted in the analysis of HEI,
DQIR, and RFS, but not in the AHEI or aMed scores because alcohol
is one of the components of these indices. We also classiﬁed breast
cancer by the ER status of the tumors. In stratiﬁed analysis, we cen-
sored women when they were diagnosed with breast cancer with ER
status that was not the outcome of the particular analysis. For example,
in analysis of ER1 tumors, we censored women when they were
diagnosed with ER2 tumors. We did not present data on progesterone
receptor status because it did not affect the diet-breast cancer relation.

RESULTS

During 18 y of follow-up, we ascertained 3580 cases of breast
cancer in postmenopausal women. Of these, 2367 were ER1
and 575 were ERÿ; the remainder (638 cases) could not be
clearly classiﬁed. In this cohort, women who scored high on
these indices were less likely to be smokers, had a higher level of
physical activity, and were more likely to use postmenopausal
hormones (Table 1).

When we considered all postmenopausal breast cancer
cases, we did not ﬁnd any association with any of the diet
quality indices (Table 2). However, when we analyzed ER1
and ERÿ cases separately, we found an inverse association
between AHEI, RFS, and aMed and ERÿ cases (Table 3).
After adjusting for potential confounders, the relative risks
(RR) comparing top and bottom quintiles of these scores were
0.78 (95% CI ¼ 0.59–1.04, P for trend ¼ 0.01) for AHEI, 0.69
(95% CI ¼ 0.51–0.94, P for trend ¼ 0.003) for RFS, 0.79 (95%
CI ¼ 0.60–1.03, P for trend ¼ 0.03) for aMed. Of these 3
indices, RFS had the strongest association with ERÿ tumors.

When AHEI, RFS, and aMed were included in the same
regression model, the relative risks (RR) comparing top and
bottom quintiles of these scores were 0.83 (95% CI ¼ 0.54–
1.26, P for trend ¼ 0.31) for AHEI, 0.78 (95% CI ¼ 0.53–1.14,
P for trend ¼ 0.06) for RFS, and 1.04 (95% CI ¼ 0.67–1.66, P
for trend ¼ 0.71) for aMed. There was no association with ER1
cases for these scores. The HEI and DQI-R were not associated
with ER status. The RR of ER1 and ERÿ tumors did not differ
for any of the diet quality scores. We conducted an additional
analysis using baseline (1984 diet) and found essentially the
same results. In an alternate approach to compare the indices,
we assessed the risk for ERÿ breast cancer for a 10% increase in
each of the scores. There was no association with HEI (RR ¼
0.96, P ¼ 0.36) or DQIR (RR ¼ 0.95, P ¼ 0.23). However, for

each 10% increase in AHEI, there was an 11% reduction of risk
(P ¼ 0.01), for RFS a 12% reduction (P ¼ 0.002), and for aMed
a 7% reduction (P ¼ 0.02) (not shown). Because AHEI and
aMed awarded points for alcohol intake of 1–2 drinks/d, we
additionally adjusted for alcohol intake in secondary analysis
and obtained essentially the same results.
When we examined the association between the compo-
nents of AHEI and aMed and their association with ERÿ breast
cancer, we found that a high score on the vegetable component
in AHEI (RR comparing top to bottom quintile ¼ 0.68, 95%
CI ¼ 0.51, 0.91, P for trend ¼ 0.01) was associated with a lower
risk. An inverse association was also observed with comparably
higher intakes of unsaturated fats than saturated fats for the
AHEI. The RR comparing top to bottom quintile of the

2 Adjusted for age, BMI, physical activity, age at menopause and postmenopausal hormone therapy use, smoking, energy intake, family history,
weight change since age 18 y, multivitamin use (except for AHEI because it is a component), history of benign breast disease, weight at age 18 y, alcohol
(except for AHEI, DQI-R, and aMed because alcohol was part of the scoring criteria).

polyunsaturated:saturated fat intake ratio was 0.75 (95% CI ¼
0.58, 0.98, P for trend ¼ 0.02) (Table 4). Similarly, for the
aMed index, the RR comparing top to bottom quintile of the
monounsaturated:saturated fat intake ratio was 0.79 (95% CI
¼ 0.63, 0.99, P for trend ¼ 0.04). There was also a suggestion of
inverse association with higher score (thus higher intake) of
fruits for the AHEI. Alcohol intake, in the range of 1–2 drinks/
d (intake of this range was awarded a higher score in AHEI and
aMed) did not appear to inﬂuence the risk of ERÿ breast cancer.
Because vegetables are major contributors to the RFS, we
further analyzed subtypes of vegetables and risk of ERÿ tumors.
We observed an inverse association with yellow/orange
vegetables, with an RR of 0.76 comparing 11/d intake vs.
,2/wk (95% CI ¼ 0.57, 0.99, P for trend ¼ 0.04) (Table 5).
Similarly, RR for ‘‘other’’ vegetables (vegetables that do not ﬁt
into the categories speciﬁed, such as eggplant, green peppers,
and celery) was 0.67 (95% CI ¼ 0.53, 0.87, P for trend ¼ 0.03).
Although there was no signiﬁcant inverse trend with leafy
vegetable intake, the RR was 0.72 (95% CI ¼ 0.54, 0.96) for

consumption frequency of 5–6/wk and 0.71 (95% CI ¼ 0.55,
0.90) for 11/d, compared with ,2 times/wk consumption.
Because intakes of different types of vegetables are correlated,
we attempted to tease out the independent association of these
vegetable types with ERÿ breast cancer by including all
vegetables types in the regression model. In general, the inverse
associations were somewhat attenuated and P-values for trend
were no longer signiﬁcant. However, daily intake of at least 1
serving of ‘‘other’’ vegetables, compared with ,2 times/wk,
remained inversely associated with ERÿ tumors (RR ¼ 0.73,
95% CI ¼ 0.54, 0.99).

DISCUSSION

In this study, only the AHEI, RFS and aMed scores were
inversely associated with ERÿ breast cancer. There was no
association between the risk of ER1 breast cancer and any of
the diet quality scores after multivariate adjustment.

2 10 points are awarded for intake within the range of 0.5–1.5 drinks/d. Fewer points are awarded for intake above or below this range.

Although numerous studies have examined the association
between foods and nutrients and breast cancer risk, very few
have focused on the entire diet, and none to our knowledge
have used established diet quality indices as predictors of risk.
In addition, subtypes of breast cancer have generally not been
analyzed separately. Risk factors for breast cancer may differ
according to the ER status of the tumor (5,18). Estrogen
exposure is one of the strongest risk factors for breast cancer,
but it may have less inﬂuence on ERÿ tumors than ER1
tumors. This is supported by results of chemoprevention trials
on ER modulators in which the reduction of incidence was
observed for ER1 tumors only (19,20). Therefore, in ER1
tumors, any potential inﬂuence of dietary factors may be dif-
ﬁcult to detect given the strong inﬂuence of hormonal factors.
Conversely, in ERÿ tumors, other risk factors, including diet,

may exert a relatively larger inﬂuence and be more easily
detectable.
The HEI, AHEI, and RFS did not predict combined cancer
risk from all sites in our cohort (2). However, ERÿ breast
cancer was only a small portion of all cancers diagnosed in our
cohort; therefore, the lack of association with overall cancer
risk is not inconsistent with our ﬁndings. In a cohort of Swedish
women, those whose RFS score was in the highest quintile had
a 24% lower risk (P for trend ¼ 0.005) of overall cancer
mortality than those with scores in the bottom quintile (3). On
the other hand, the Mediterranean Diet Score (on which ours
was based), was inversely associated with overall cancer
mortality (15). Empirically derived dietary patterns using factor
analysis identiﬁed a ‘‘prudent’’ pattern that has characteristics
similar to the AHEI and aMed (21,22). This pattern was not

associated with overall breast cancer risk in one study (22);
however, when ER types were analyzed separately, an inverse
association was observed with ERÿ cancer (23).

The ability of diet quality scores to predict breast cancer risk
depends on how well these scores measure dietary risk factors
for breast cancer. The most consistent dietary risk factor for
breast cancer is alcohol (4), and folate is a possible modiﬁer in
this relation (24). Fruits and vegetables, the major sources of
folate were inversely associated with overall breast cancer in
a case-control study (25), but this association was mainly null in
cohort studies (26,27). However, such studies generally did not
distinguish between ER subtypes. When tumors of different ER
status were analyzed separately, an inverse association was
observed with ERÿ tumors in one cohort (28). In a recent
study from our group, each serving of vegetables intake was
associated with a 6% reduction in ERÿ breast cancer and each
serving of fruit was associated with a 12% reduction, whereas
no association was observed for ER1 tumors (23). In addition,
a dietary pattern consisting of fruits, vegetables, whole grains,
ﬁsh, and poultry was also associated with a lower risk of ERÿ
tumors compared with diets low in those foods. Fat intake after
menopause has little association with breast cancer risk (29), but
premenopausal fat intake from red meats and dairy products may
be associated with breast cancer in premenopausal women (30).
All diet quality scores include fruits and vegetables, but they
contribute only 10–20% of the total score except for the RFS to
which they contribute ;80% of the total score. In addition, the
AHEI also awards points for multivitamin intake, which usually
contains a substantial amount of folic acid.
The RFS, which had the strongest inverse relation with
ERÿ tumors, does not include alcohol. The AHEI and aMed
consider moderate alcohol intake to be a beneﬁcial component

of the diet given its association with lower cardiovascular
disease risk (31); thus, it may not be optimal to use it as a re-
commendation for breast cancer prevention. Because both the
AHEI and aMed indices are inversely associated with ERÿ breast
cancer, moderate alcohol intake may not overwhelm the ben-
eﬁcial inﬂuence of other dietary components.

Because cancer development is usually slow, the long follow-
up period in this study and the availability of dietary infor-
mation over multiple years increase the possibility that we can
capture important periods during which diet may exert an
inﬂuence on breast cancer risk in adults. Our analysis was
adjusted extensively for potential confounders. Although we
did not observe an association with ER1 tumors, this does not
exclude the possibility that diet earlier in life may have an in-
ﬂuence on the development of ER1 tumors.

As illustrated in Table 2, the distribution of cases in each the
quintile of the various scores varied; this is expected given the
different criteria for what constitutes a healthy diet in these
scores. Thus, we are comparing different constructs, and popu-
lations will score higher or lower on various indices, depending
on the components of the score and the underlying consump-
tion of those dietary components in a population. We thought
it was most objective to compare associations based on dis-
tribution within each score (e.g., quintiles).
In conclusion, our ﬁndings suggest that ERÿ breast cancer
tumors may be more strongly associated with diet than ER1
tumors. We found that high scores for the AHEI, RFS, and
aMed were associated with a lower risk of ERÿ breast cancer,
whereas the HEI and DQI-R were of limited value in predicting
breast cancer risk. The dietary patterns reﬂected by these scores
may serve as possible guidelines for cancer prevention, espe-
cially for ERÿ breast cancer in postmenopausal women.

Abstract

Tea and its main bioactive ingredients, the ﬂavonoids, have been associated with human cancer for several decades. In

this article, an overview is provided of observational epidemiological studies of lung cancer incidence in relation to intake of

green tea, black tea, ﬂavonols/ﬂavones, and catechins. A PubMed search was conducted in September 2007. Articles

were selected if they provided risk ratios (relative risk or odds ratio) for lung cancer and were of observational design

(cohort, case-control, or case-cohort). Three of 12 studies reported a signiﬁcantly lower risk of lung cancer with a high

intake of ﬂavonoids, whereas 1 study reported a signiﬁcantly increased risk. After stratiﬁcation by type of ﬂavonoid,

catechin intake was no longer associated with lung cancer risk in 3 of 4 studies available. For tea, 4 of 20 studies reported

signiﬁcantly reduced risks with high intake. Two studies found signﬁcantly increased risk ratios, but both were older

studies. Findings were similar for green and black tea but became more signiﬁcant when only methodologically sounder

cohort studies were considered. When tea intake and lung cancer were studied among never- or former smokers to

eliminate the confounding effect of smoking, 4 of 7 reported associations were signiﬁcantly protective. In general, the

studies on tea, ﬂavonoids, and lung cancer risk indicate a small beneﬁcial association, particularly among never-smokers.

More well-designed cohort studies, in particular for catechins, are needed to strengthen the evidence on effects of long-

term exposure to physiological doses of dietary ﬂavonoids. J. Nutr. 138: 1561S–1566S, 2008.

Introduction

Tea consumption has been associated, both positively and
negatively, with human cancer for several decades. The ﬁrst
epidemiological report on tea and cancer was published in 1966
(1). Since then, an increasing number of epidemiological studies

on tea intake and cancer have appeared. A PubMed search
conducted in September 2007 with the keywords ‘‘tea and
cancer and epidemiolog*’’ yielded 556 hits. In recent years the
collective evidence available for several types of cancer has been
summarized in systematic reviews and meta-analyses (2–4), but
to date, no such review has been published for lung cancer.

Tea, from a biological standpoint, is not a clearly deﬁned
substance. All tea is produced from the leaves of Camellia
sinensis, but differences in processing result in several types of
tea, of which green and black tea are the most consumed world-
wide. Moreover, tea is a complex mixture of a large number of
bioactive components, including catechins, ﬂavonols, lignans,
and phenolic acids. Theaﬂavins and thearubigins are present
only in black tea as a result of oxidative processes (5). All types
of tea and the major phenolic compounds present in tea have
been the subject of epidemiological studies. The debate is still
open as to which of these phenolic compounds might be of
primary importance, whether the combination of compounds is
essential, or if perhaps unknown components might be respon-
sible for any health-modulating effects of tea.

An earlier review on ﬂavonoids and chronic diseases (6)
found evidence suggestive of a lower risk of lung cancer with a
higher intake of ﬂavonols/ﬂavones. However, at the time, only 4
cohort studies were available. Data from studies on asthma
incidence (7) and lung function (8) also suggested beneﬁcial
effects from ﬂavonoids. In an animal study, where rats were
given the major ﬂavonol quercetin for 11 wk, the highest tissue

concentrations were found in the lung (9). Taken together, these
data suggested a beneﬁcial effect of tea and/or ﬂavonoids on lung
health. This article provides an overview of observational ep-
idemiological studies considering lung cancer incidence or
mortality in relation to intake of green tea, black tea, ﬂavonols/
ﬂavones, and catechins.

Methods

A search in the PubMed database was conducted in September 2007
using the keywords tea, ﬂavon*, ﬂavan*, catechin, polyphenol, cancer,
tumor, cohort, case-control, case-cohort, intervention, meta-analysis,
and epidemiolog*. Reference lists of original articles on tea or ﬂavonoids
and lung cancer and reviews on tea or ﬂavonoids and cancer were
checked for relevant studies. Articles were selected for this review if they
provided risk ratios [relative risk or odds ratio (OR)] for lung cancer and
were of observational design (cohort, case-control, or case-cohort). Two
studies were excluded because no risk ratios were presented (10,11).
Studies on both incidence and mortality were included, but only 2
articles used lung cancer mortality data (12,13). From the articles, we
retrieved the number and gender of the participants, years of follow-up
(cohort and case-cohort studies only), and type of tea and/or ﬂavonoids
studied. The most adjusted risk estimates, comparing the highest versus
the lowest intake category, corresponding 95% conﬁdence intervals (CI),
and P-values for dose-response trend tests were extracted for this review.
If the original article did not present aggregated risk estimates, data for
subgroups (e.g., male/female, smokers/nonsmokers) were taken instead.
The 3 studies that did not specify the type of tea were from the United
States, Canada, and Sweden and were assumed to pertain to black tea.
Flavonols and ﬂavones were grouped together because the intake of
ﬂavones is minor compared with the intake of ﬂavonols.

Case-control studies are vulnerable to recall bias, a phenomenon that
leads to attenuation of associations and that occurs because diseased
subjects may remember their diet differently from control subjects.
Therefore, results from cohort studies and case-control studies were also
discussed separately. A second major methodological issue in the analysis
of observational studies is confounding. Confounding is particularly
important when weak associations are studied in the presence of strong
confounders. In the case of the tea/ﬂavonoid-lung cancer association,
smoking is one such strong confounder. Even after meticulous adjust-
ment for smoking behavior, residual confounding may exist. To reduce
the residual confounding presented by the strong smoking confounder,
we also summarized studies that only considered never- or former
smokers who had quit .20 y ago.

Results

Twelve studies, including 8 cohort studies, reported on the
association between intake of ﬂavonoids and lung cancer
incidence (Table 1). None of the ﬂavonoid studies considered
lung cancer mortality. All studies, except those by Arts et al.
(18,19) reported risk estimates for ﬂavonols/ﬂavones. More
recent studies have started to include catechins as well. Three
articles reported a signiﬁcantly lower risk of lung cancer with a
high intake of ﬂavonoids (15,17,20), whereas 1 article (24)
reported a signiﬁcantly increased risk. The association between
ﬂavonol/ﬂavone intake and lung cancer incidence was similar to
that for ﬂavonoids as a whole, but leaving out the methodolog-
ically less strong case-control studies allowed a stronger sug-
gestion of a protective association to emerge. Of the 6 cohort
studies, 3 showed a signiﬁcant inverse association, and 3 showed
no effect. Only 1 of 4 studies on catechins and lung cancer found
a signiﬁcant effect, with a risk ratio of 0.94 and a 95% CI of
0.91–0.98 (20). Leaving out the case-control study by Lagiou
et al. (24) did not change the ﬁndings for catechins.

On the association of tea and lung cancer, 20 studies were
published, including 6 cohort studies (Table 2). Two of the
cohort studies used data for cancer mortality instead of in-
cidence (12,13). Two studies were excluded from this overview
because they did not report a risk ratio estimate: Heilbrun et al.
(10), who were the ﬁrst to report on tea and lung cancer in 1986,
found no signiﬁcantly different age-adjusted lung cancer pro-
portion for frequent consumers of black tea. Huang et al. (11)
only mentioned that the association between green tea and
jasmine tea and lung cancer in their small case-control study was
not signiﬁcant. The overview of all studies on tea and lung
cancer is fairly symmetrical, although it appears slightly skewed
toward a protective association of tea intake (Fig. 1). Four risk
ratios reported were signiﬁcantly below 1 (27,34–36). Two
studies reported risk ratios that were signiﬁcantly higher than
1 (12,31). Both were older studies, and Kinlen et al. (12) did not
report a CI. Stratifying by type of tea consumed did not
substantially change the distribution of risk estimates (data
not shown). When the case-control studies were omitted from
consideration, few studies remained. Of the 3 cohort studies on
black tea, only the study by Kinlen et al. (12) showed a
signiﬁcantly increased risk for lung cancer. For green tea, the

rized in Figure 2. Four of seven studies that reported associations
among nonsmokers showed a signiﬁcant protective association
for a high intake of tea. The other 3 associations were not
signiﬁcantly different from 1. All studies were among women,
presumably because in most countries there are too few never-
smoking men to conduct meaningful analyses. In the studies by
Kubik et al. (37,40), nonsmokers were deﬁned as women who
had never smoked and women who had quit .20 y ago. The
other 3 studies included never-smokers only. Only 2 studies on
ﬂavonoid intake and lung cancer incidence presented risk
estimates for never-smokers. Garcia-Closas et al. (21) reported
that ﬁndings were similar to those for the whole sample (i.e., a
nonsigniﬁcant risk ratio of 0.98). Lagiou et al. (24) likewise
found no signiﬁcant interaction between smoking status and
ﬂavonoid intake, with risk estimates that were comparable to
those for the whole group.

Discussion

The collective evidence available so far from observational
epidemiological studies on tea, ﬂavonoids, and lung cancer risk
tends toward a small beneﬁcial association for green and black
tea, particularly among never-smokers, and for ﬂavonols/
ﬂavones but not for catechins. Studies that report increased
risks with a high intake of tea are mostly older studies that were
published at a time when tea was considered a possible car-

cases with adenocarcinoma (OR ¼ 0.9; 95% CI ¼ 0.4–2.0).
Similarly, Zhong et al. (35) also reported a lower OR for
nonsmoking women with nonadenocarcinomas compared with
adenocarcinomas, but the numbers of cases were small, and
trends were not signiﬁcant. Baker et al. (39), on the other hand,
found similar associations for black tea intake with different
subtypes (adeno-, squamous cell, small cell, and large cell
carcinoma) of lung cancer. More research is needed to determine
whether lung cancer type is of importance.

Residual confounding occurs if confounders, extraneous
factors that are associated with both the outcome and the
exposure under study, are not or insufﬁciently accounted for in
the statistical analysis. Studying associations in never-smokers is
an effective way of ruling out residual confounding by smoking.
Zhong et al. (35) have elegantly shown that the manner in which
models are adjusted for confounding by smoking can greatly
inﬂuence the results. The OR between green tea drinking and
lung cancer among women was 1.69 (95% CI ¼ 0.78–3.62)
without adjustment for smoking. When 4 categories of pack-
years were added to the model, the OR changed to 1.09, whereas
adding the number of cigarettes per day (as 3 categories) instead
gave an OR of 1.23. A smoothing technique, which allows more
precise adjustment for confounding, changed the estimated OR
to 1.23 and 0.94 for pack-years and number of cigarettes per
day, respectively. So, with use of different techniques to adjust
for smoking, the effect estimate changed signiﬁcantly from 1.69
to 0.94, although none of the estimates was signiﬁcant. In the
same article, Zhong and co-workers (35) also reported the OR
for never-smokers, which was 0.65 (95% CI ¼ 0.45–0.93) and
signiﬁcant. Thus, residual confounding for strong confounders
such as smoking can lead to higher risk estimates in populations
where smoking is associated with tea drinking. Our overview of
studies among nonsmokers suggests that, indeed, protective
associations become more distinct in this group. On the other
hand, when tea drinking is associated with a healthy lifestyle,
associations may become more beneﬁcial as a result of residual
confounding. More research among never-smokers is needed to
resolve this issue, taking into account exposure to environmental
smoke and other determinants of lung cancer among never
smokers.

In tea-drinking populations, the correlation between tea
intake and ﬂavonoid intake is high. For example, in the Zutphen
Elderly Study in The Netherlands, the correlation between
catechins and tea was 0.98, making the 2 variables essentially
interchangeable (18). Which approach is preferred then, the
food-based one or the component-based approach? Of course
that depends on the hypothesized mechanism: if ﬂavonoids are
considered to be the active compounds in tea, then it makes
more sense to look at ﬂavonoids directly. In countries where tea
intake is low, such as many Mediterranean countries, other
sources of ﬂavonoids will become important. However, if other
compounds in tea, or combinations of compounds, are believed
to be important, then tea would be the preferred exposure. In
that case, calculating ﬂavonoid intake will merely introduce
additional error. The results presented in this overview show that
a similar picture emerges, whether tea or ﬂavonoids are used as
exposure estimates. For catechins, too few studies have been
published to draw any conclusions. Despite its drawbacks,
observational epidemiology is the only type of research that is
able to assess the effects of long-term exposure to physiological
doses of bioactive compounds on real disease endpoints. It
therefore has great value in the study of the association between
intake of tea and ﬂavonoids and lung cancer risk. Accumulating
more data from well-designed studies, together with more

cinogenic and mutagenic (10,31). Several authors found that in
the Ames test, 1 cup of black or green tea was more mutagenic
than the smoke condensate of 1 cigarette (31,41). Epidemiolog-
ical data published later have not conﬁrmed these concerns.
Peters et al. (42) found evidence for publication bias in a meta-
analysis on tea consumption and risk of stroke. We have not
examined publication bias. However, it seems unlikely that
studies ﬁnding increased lung cancer risks with increased tea or
ﬂavonoid consumption would remain unpublished, given the
increased risk ratios reported in early studies and also in the light
of more recent reports regarding the increased mortality risks
that seem to be associated with taking antioxidant supplements,
particularly among smokers (43,44). Studies that found in-
creased risks with higher tea or ﬂavonoid intake were mostly of
the case-control design. Only 1 cohort study found a risk
estimate that was signiﬁcantly above 1: the 1988 study by Kinlen
et al. (12). In this study, tea intake was adjusted for smoking only
but not for other risk factors.

Accurate assessment of exposure to tea and/or ﬂavonoids is
not easy. In general, food frequency questionnaires were not
designed to assess tea or ﬂavonoid intake. In recent years,
assessment of tea consumption has received more attention (45),
but certainly baseline measurements of the older epidemiolog-
ical studies have yielded imprecise exposure estimates. Even if
the level of tea consumption is assessed accurately, differences in
cultivars and production methods and in brewing methods at
home also signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the tea composition (46) and,
consequently, the internal exposure to bioactive ingredients.
Several databases have been used to estimate ﬂavonoid intake
from dietary data. The Dutch values (46–49) that were most
frequently used in epidemiological studies are now part of the
comprehensive USDA ﬂavonoid database (50), which has
rigorous quality control. It is my hope that more studies will
use this database in the near future. Inaccurate assessment of
exposure to tea/ﬂavonoids has probably led to nondifferential
misclassiﬁcation and an underestimation of the true associations
in the epidemiological studies presented here.

Although lung cancer is treated here as a single disease,
etiologically and histologically clearly distinct types of lung
cancer can be distinguished. Yet few authors of articles on this
subject have stratiﬁed their data by type of lung cancer. Le
Marchand et al. (23) found a stronger inverse trend with quer-
cetin intake among cases with squamous cell carcinoma (OR in
the highest quartile ¼ 0.5; 95% CI ¼ 0.2–1.9) compared with

Cellular Proliferation, Apoptosis and

Angiogenesis: Molecular Targets for Nutritional

Preemption of Cancer

Cindy D. Davis, Nancy J. Emenaker, and John A. Milner

Malignant cells are characterized by abnormal signaling pathways involving proliferation, apoptosis,
and angiogenesis. These cancer centric pathways are known to be modiﬁed by several bioactive
dietary components, although admittedly there are inconsistencies in the response. The response
is dependent on the amount and duration of exposure to the dietary component and the cell type.
While caution should be exercised when extrapolating in vitro data to in vivo conditions, such
studies do provide valuable insights into plausible mechanisms. Signiﬁcant gene–nutrient and
nutrient–nutrient interactions may contribute to the uncertainty of the response to foods and/or
their components. One of the challenges is the identiﬁcation of which process(es), either singly or
in combination, is/are most important in leading to a dietary-mediated phenotypic change. The
dearth of controlled intervention studies that have investigated molecular targets for nutritional
preemption in humans make ﬁrm dietary recommendations difﬁcult. Until more deﬁnite informa-
tion surfaces, a balanced but varied diet is most prudent.
Semin Oncol 37:243-257. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Evidence continues to mount that altering dietary

habits is an effective and cost-efﬁcient approach
both for reducing cancer risk and for modifying
the biological behavior of tumors. The World Cancer
Research Fund/American Institute of Cancer Research
has estimated that cancer is 30% to 40% preventable by
appropriate food and nutrition, regular physical activ-
ity, and avoidance of obesity.1 On a global scale, they
have estimated that yearly about 3 to 4 million cancer
cases might be prevented by adherence to their recom-
mendations.1

While optimizing the intake of speciﬁc foods and/or
their bioactive components seems to be a practical,
noninvasive, and cost-effective strategy for reducing
the cancer burden, this is far from simple.2 The com-
plexity of the problem is evident in the literally thou-
sands of dietary compounds consumed each day.2,3 For
example, it is estimated that humans consume more
than 5,000 individual ﬂavonoids, yet only a few have
been examined for their cancer protective effects.2

Furthermore, the lack of quantitative information about
some known food constituents limits the ability to
decipher which are most important. Unfortunately,
since many bioactive food components remain largely
uncharacterized, confusion can arise about the true
role of a food as a determinant of health and disease
prevention. Interactions, both synergistic and antago-
nistic, between food components may explain why
isolated components do not always behave identically
to intact foods.4 Finally, the composition of the entire
diet (pattern) may inﬂuence the magnitude of the re-
sponse to a bioactive food component and ultimately
cancer.4

Predictive, validated and sensitive biomarkers, in-
cluding those that (1) evaluate “intake” (exposure) to a
speciﬁc food or bioactive component; (2) assess one or
more speciﬁc biological responses (effect); and (3)
predict individual “susceptibility” as a function of nu-
trient–nutrient interactions and genetics, are funda-
mental to evaluating who will beneﬁt most or be
placed at risk from dietary interventions. These biomar-
kers must be readily accessible, easily and reliably as-
sayed, and predictive of a key process(es) involved in
cancer.

In addition to identifying bioactive dietary compo-
nents, it is critical to deﬁne the amount of the speciﬁc
bioactive component that is needed to achieve concen-
trations in target tissues that will lead to a phenotypic
change. The response to a food is determined not only

Abstract
The Nutritional Prevention of Cancer Trial was a
randomized, clinical trial designed to evaluate the efficacy
of selenium as selenized yeast (200 ␮g daily) in
preventing the recurrence of nonmelanoma skin cancer
among 1312 residents of the Eastern United States.
Original secondary analyses through December 31, 1993
showed striking inverse associations between treatment
and the incidence of total [hazard ratio (HR) ⴝ 0.61,
95% confidence interval (CI) ⴝ 0.46 – 0.82], lung,
prostate, and colorectal cancer and total cancer mortality.
This report presents results through February 1, 1996,
the end of blinded treatment. Effect modification by
baseline characteristics is also evaluated. The effects of
treatment overall and within subgroups of baseline age,
gender, smoking status, and plasma selenium were
examined using incidence rate ratios and Cox
proportional hazards models. Selenium supplementation
reduced total (HR ⴝ 0.75, 95% CI ⴝ 0.58 – 0.97) and
prostate (HR ⴝ 0.48, 95% CI ⴝ 0.28 – 0.80) cancer
incidence but was not significantly associated with lung
(HR ⴝ 0.74, 95% CI ⴝ 0.44 –1.24) and colorectal (HR ⴝ
0.46, 95% CI ⴝ 0.21–1.02) cancer incidence. The effects
of treatment on other site-specific cancers are also
described. The protective effect of selenium was confined
to males (HR ⴝ 0.67, 95% CI ⴝ 0.50 – 0.89) and was
most pronounced in former smokers. Participants with

baseline plasma selenium concentrations in the lowest two
tertiles (<121.6 ng/ml) experienced reductions in total
cancer incidence, whereas those in the highest tertile
showed an elevated incidence (HR ⴝ 1.20, 95% CI ⴝ
0.77–1.86). The Nutritional Prevention of Cancer trial
continues to show a protective effect of selenium on
cancer incidence, although not all site-specific cancers
exhibited a reduction in incidence. This treatment effect
was restricted to males and to those with lower baseline
plasma selenium concentrations.

Introduction
The NPC4 Trial (1) contributed substantially to the evidence
supporting selenium as a chemopreventive agent. These results,
which have been cited in the medical literature over 400 times
in the last 5 years, have also received considerable public
attention. The study was originally designed to test the efficacy
of selenium supplementation in preventing NMSC recurrence
in men and women with a history of two or more BCCs or one
SCC of the skin. The hypothesis for this trial was supported by
Clark’s observation that populations in the southeastern United
States, a region with soil selenium concentrations lower than
those of the rest of the country, showed elevated NMSC rates
(2). Thus, Clark and colleagues initiated a randomized clinical
trial of selenium supplementation for preventing the recurrence
of NMSC in this high-risk population. The original trial results
failed to confirm that selenium supplementation prevented
NMSC recurrence. Indeed, the incidence of new BCCs was
increased by a nonsignificant 10% among selenium-supple-
mented individuals, whereas the incidence of new SCCs was
increased by an again nonsignificant 14%.

Nevertheless, early in the intervention, an unexpected def-
icit of other cancer and mortality endpoints among selenium-
supplemented participants became apparent, so that in 1993,
endpoints for the trial were expanded to include lung, prostate,
and colorectal cancer, as well as total cancer incidence and total
cancer mortality. In 1994, the Safety Monitoring and Advisory
Committee recommended the trial be unblinded and results
published. The National Cancer Institute audited the study in
May 1995, and, with the National Cancer Institute’s approval,
the blinded phase of patient treatment and follow-up ended in
February 1996. At this time, all participants were informed of
their treatment status, given the opportunity to take selenium
supplements, and reconsented to participate in the Open-Label
Phase of this trial.

The apparent effects of selenium supplementation on can-
cer incidence through the end of 1993 (representing an average
of 6.4 years of subject follow-up) were striking. The original
report indicated that selenium supplementation led to a mar-
ginally statistically significant decrease in (a) lung cancer in-
cidence (HR ⫽ 0.56, 95% CI ⫽ 0.0.31–1.01, P ⫽ 0.05), (b)
statistically significant decreases in prostate cancer incidence
(HR ⫽ 0.35, 95% CI ⫽ 0.18 – 0.65, P ⫽ 0.001), (c) colorectal
cancer incidence (HR ⫽ 0.39, 95% CI ⫽ 0.17– 0.90, P ⫽ 0.03),
(d) total cancer incidence (HR ⫽ 0.61, 95% CI ⫽ 0.46 – 0.82,
P ⬍ 0.001), and (e) total cancer mortality (HR ⫽ 0.48, 95%
CI ⫽ 0.0.31– 0.76, P ⫽ 0.001).

The current report adds considerably to the statistical
precision of this trial by extending the previously reported
results (September 15, 1983 to December 31, 1993) through the
entire blinded phase of the trial (September 15 1983 to February
1, 1996). With total cancer incidence as the primary end point,
mean subject follow-up time was enhanced by 1 year to an
average of 7.4 years. Overall, selenium supplementation con-
tinued to reduce the incidence of total cancer and prostate,
colorectal, and lung cancers, although the reduction in inci-
dence of the latter two cancers was not statistically significant.
Not all site-specific cancers presented in this report exhibited a
reduction in risk with selenium supplementation. In addition,
this analysis describes the effect of selenium supplementation
on total cancer incidence within subgroups defined by key
baseline characteristics including age, gender, smoking status,
and plasma selenium. The protective effect of selenium sup-
plementation on total cancer incidence was most prominent in
males and those with lower baseline plasma selenium concen-
trations. Although the examination of treatment effects in sub-
group analyses is fraught with potential limitations, and the
modest sample size limits statistical power and interpretation,
subgroup analyses in this important dataset provide an oppor-
tunity to evaluate trends in the data, which may further our
understanding of the effectiveness of selenium as a chemopre-
ventive agent.

Materials and Methods
The protocol for the NPC study is described in the original
report by Clark et al. (1). Briefly, this study was a randomized,
double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted among 1312
participants living in the Eastern United States. Participants had
a history of two or more BCCs or one SCC of the skin, with one
of these occurring within the year prior to randomization.
Participants had a life expectancy of at least 5 years and had had
no internal malignancies treated within the previous 5 years.
Exclusion criteria included a history of significant liver or
kidney disorders. Although recruitment was gender neutral,
approximately three-quarters of the participants were male.

This study was conducted in dermatology clinics in seven
cities located in low-selenium areas of the United States, including
Augusta, Georgia; Macon, Georgia; Columbia, South Carolina;
Miami, Florida; Wilson, North Carolina; Greenville, North Caro-
lina; and Newington, Connecticut. Recruitment began on Septem-
ber 15, 1983 and continued each year through 1991. Participants
were randomized in a double-blinded fashion to the experimental
treatment or an identical placebo. Experimental participants were
treated with 200 ␮g of selenium supplied in a 0.5-g high-selenium
baker’s yeast tablet provided by Nutrition 21 (La Jolla, CA)
through 1995 and by Cypress Systems (Fresno, CA) thereafter.
The selenium content of each batch of pills was determined in the
laboratories of Dr. G. F. Combs, Jr. and of Dr. I. S. Palmer (South
Dakota State University, Brookings, SD) using the diaminonaptha-

lene-fluorometric procedure after nitric-perchloric acid digestion
(3). Plasma selenium concentration was determined in the labora-
tory of Dr. G. F. Combs, Jr. by automated electrothermal atomic
absorption spectrophotometry (Perkin-Elmer 3030; Perkin-Elmer
Corp., Norwalk, CT) equipped with an electrodeless discharge
lamp and automatic Zeeman-effect background correction. Quality
control included multiple aliquots of human plasma as external
control samples. A coefficient of variation of ⬍7% (for duplicate
analyses) was the criterion for acceptance (4).

At the baseline interview, sociodemographic and behav-
ioral variables including education (number of years of school-
ing, 0 –18), occupation (classified according to NIH standards),
numbers of years on farm, use of vitamin supplements, use of
sunscreen, cancer screening information, number of alcoholic
drinks/day, smoking status (current, former, never), number of
cigarettes smoked/day, and years of smoking were collected
from the participants. In addition, a thorough medical and
medication history was obtained at baseline and updated at each
biannual follow-up visit. Patient medical records from each
clinic were reviewed periodically to ascertain information from
both study and nonstudy visits to ensure the completeness and
accuracy of the information. For participants who became in-
active, annual contact was attempted using the National Death
Index and ChoicePoint (formerly Equifax Inc.) to determine
vital status and identify diagnoses of new illnesses. In the event
of reports of new illnesses or medical procedures, research
nurses requested medical, surgical, and pathology records from
physicians in hospitals for documentation. Searches for addi-
tional cases of cancer were also performed at each state tumor
registry in which a clinic site was located. An oncologist or
appropriate medical specialist reviewed every cancer record
and confirmed the diagnosis. A nosologist coded the death
certificates. Review and coding of all records occurred in a
blinded manner.

At the end of the blinded period of treatment on February
2, 1996, 35.9% of participants were still on treatment, 16.6%
were off treatment but still having routine dermatological ex-
aminations, 22.1% of participants were censored for dermato-
logical endpoints but not other endpoints, and 24.8% had died.
After a total of 9301 PY of follow-up, no participants were lost
to vital follow-up, and only seven subjects (three in the sele-
nium group and four in the placebo group) declined to provide
additional illness information. Participant-reported compliance
indicated that 79.3% of participants (80.3% in the placebo
group and 78.4% in the selenium group) missed taking a pill
less than twice a month.

Sixty-two participants (including two cancer cases in each
treatment group) whose initial blood draws were drawn ⬎4
days after the randomization date were excluded from the
analysis. Thus, all statistical analyses were based on data from
those 1250 participants with initial blood draws within 4 days
of randomization. Results obtained from the total cohort of
1312 participants and the subsample of 1250 participants with
valid baseline selenium values (621 participants in the selenium
group and 629 participants in the placebo group) showed no
significant differences when continuous (age, BMI, and plasma
selenium concentrations) and categorical (gender and smoking
status) baseline variables were compared using t tests and ␹2
tests, respectively. In addition, no significant differences in
incidence data from the total cohort and subsample of the NPC
participants were detected.

Within the subsample of 1250 NPC participants, t tests and
␹2 tests were conducted to determine any differences in the
distribution of these baseline variables between treatment
groups. PY of follow-up were calculated among the subsample

of 1250 subjects. For subjects without cancer, PY were com-
puted using the date of randomization as the start date, and the
earlier of February 1, 1996 or the date of death as the closing
date. PY of follow-up for cancer cases were calculated through
the date of the first category-specific, postrandomization pri-
mary cancer diagnosis (excluding NMSC) documented in pa-
thology, surgery, or medical reports. Participants with multiple
cancers at different sites were counted only once in the analysis
of total cancer incidence and once in each site-specific analysis
in which an incident cancer was diagnosed.

Total cancer incidence data between treatment groups
were analyzed statistically through the comparison of Nelson-
Aalen (5) cumulative hazard function estimates calculated at
different time points of the trial and the two-sided log-rank test.
RRs, calculated using the ratio of the incidence density for the
treatment groups, and the corresponding 95% CIs for site-
specific and total cancer incidence and total cancer mortality
were calculated. Ps were derived from log-rank tests. Support-
ing analyses included the calculation of HRs and 95% CIs using
the Cox proportional hazards model, which allowed adjustment
for age at baseline (continuous variable), gender, and smoking
status (never, former, current) as covariates when appropriate.
Throughout this report, results of both the incidence rate ratio
and Cox proportional hazards models will be displayed in the
tables, although only the latter will be presented in the text.
Among the 1250 participants with baseline blood draws within
4 days of randomization, the effect of selenium supplementa-
tion on total cancer incidence was assessed within subgroups
determined by baseline characteristics. Effect modification by
median age (65 years), gender, and smoking status (never,
former, current) at randomization was tested using the Mantel-
Haenszel test for heterogeneity in the unadjusted models. The
statistical significance of the interaction between each baseline
characteristic and treatment group, adjusted for other important
baseline variables, was tested in a Cox proportional hazards
model that included this interaction and the corresponding main
effect terms, in addition to the variables for the adjustment.

The statistical association between total cancer incidence
and concentrations of baseline plasma selenium was also de-
termined. Based on the distribution among the 1250 partici-
pants with valid values, baseline plasma selenium concentra-
tions were divided by the median (ⱕ113.4 ng/ml and ⬎113.4
ng/ml) and by tertiles (ⱕ105.2 ng/ml, 105.3–121.6 ng/ml, and
⬎121.6 ng/ml). The effect of selenium supplementation on
total cancer incidence was assessed within these subgroups of
baseline plasma selenium with the same techniques used for the
analyses within subgroups of baseline age, gender, and smok-
ing status.

Fig. 1. Cumulative incidence of total cancer in the NPC Trial by treatment
group.

HRs, 95% CIs, and tests of statistical significance adjusted
for age, gender, and smoking status at baseline were calculated
to determine the association between baseline plasma selenium
concentrations and the subsequent development of total cancer,
according to treatment group. To confirm the consistency of
this association, three different measures of baseline plasma
selenium were used: (a) as a continuous variable (each unit ⫽
10 ng/ml); (b) by the median value; and (c) by tertiles. The
subgroups below the median or in the first tertile of baseline
plasma selenium were used as the referent groups in their
respective models. Tests for trends in the effects of baseline
plasma selenium across tertiles were conducted using the tertile
number as a continuous term in Cox proportional hazards
models.

All techniques were implemented using STATA 6.0 (6).

Results
Selected baseline characteristics of participants, by treatment
group, are displayed in Table 1. The treatment groups were well
balanced for all evaluated baseline characteristics. At random-
ization, the mean age was 63.4 years among participants ran-
domized to selenium and 63.0 years among those randomized
to placebo. The mean BMI (kg/m2) and proportions of current,
never, and former smokers at baseline did not vary appreciably
across treatment groups. The mean baseline plasma selenium
concentrations were 114.4 and 114.0 ng/ml for selenium- and
placebo-supplemented individuals, respectively. The distribu-
tions of baseline plasma selenium by median and tertile were
almost identical across treatment groups.

At unblinding (February 1, 1996), the trial had 9301 PY of
follow-up (4694 and 4607 years for the selenium and placebo
groups, respectively). Throughout this period, 242 cases of
incident cancer were diagnosed. Of these, 105 occurred in the
selenium-supplemented group, and 137 occurred in the place-
bo-supplemented group. Total cancer cumulative incidence
curves over time since randomization are shown in Fig. 1.
Cumulative incidence was lower among those receiving sele-
nium than among those receiving placebo, throughout the entire
trial. At the end of the study, the selenium group showed a
significantly lower incidence (25%) of total cancer (HR ⫽ 0.75,
95% CI ⫽ 0.58 – 0.97, P ⫽ 0.03) than the placebo group (Table
2). Table 2 also shows the RR and HR (HR ⫽ 0.61, 95% CI ⫽

selenium is diminished slightly by the inclusion of 25 months
of additional follow-up.

Analyses by cancer site are displayed in Table 3. The most
frequent site-specific cancer in this cohort was prostate cancer
(n ⫽ 64), closely followed by lung cancer (n ⫽ 60) and then by
colorectal cancer (n ⫽ 28). Prostate cancer incidence was
significantly reduced by selenium supplementation (HR ⫽
0.48, 95% CI ⫽ 0.28 – 0.80, P ⫽ 0.005); lung cancer incidence
showed a nonsignificant 26% reduction (HR ⫽ 0.74, 95% CI ⫽
0.44 –1.24, P ⫽ 0.26), and colorectal cancer incidence exhib-
ited a marginally significant reduction of 54% (HR ⫽ 0.46,
95% CI ⫽ 0.21–1.02, P ⫽ 0.057). Selenium-supplemented
individuals experienced nonsignificant reductions in incidence
for other carcinomas (thyroid, pancreatic, gastric, renal, endo-
metrial, mesothelioma, and unknown primary), other noncarci-
nomas (glioblastoma, Kaposi’s sarcoma, astrocytoma, histiocy-
toma, liposarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, and sarcoma), and cancer
of the esophagus. Conversely, participants supplemented with
selenium showed nonsignificantly increased incidence of five
of the other specific cancers, including melanoma, bladder
cancer, breast cancer, head and neck cancer, lymphoma, and
leukemia, compared with those supplemented with placebo
(Table 3).

Table 3 also shows total cancer mortality by treatment
group. One hundred and six cancer deaths occurred throughout
the trial. Of these, 40 were among selenium-supplemented
individuals, and 66 were among placebo-supplemented partic-
ipants (HR ⫽ 0.59, 95% CI ⫽ 0.39 – 0.87, P ⫽ 0.008).

The effects of selenium supplementation on total cancer
incidence within subgroups defined by baseline cancer risk
factors are shown in Table 4. There was no evidence that the
effect of selenium supplementation was related to age at base-
line. The adjusted treatment effects for males and females were
0.67 (95% CI ⫽ 0.50 – 0.89, P ⫽ 0.005) and 1.20 (95% CI ⫽

0.66 –2.20, P ⫽ 0.55), respectively. Thus, any protective treat-
ment effect in the study was confined to males. Multivariate
adjustment for age and smoking status did not alter the treat-
ment effects within either gender subgroup. Ps for heterogene-
ity and interaction were not statistically significant.

Table 4 also presents subgroup analysis by baseline cigarette
smoking status. Selenium supplementation decreased unadjusted
total cancer incidence, although not significantly so, for each
category of smoking status (never, former, and current smokers).
Similar treatment effects were observed in never smokers (HR ⫽
0.81, 95% CI 0.47–1.41, P ⫽ 0.46) and current smokers
(HR ⫽ 0.86, 95% CI 0.56–1.31, P ⫽ 0.47). Former smokers
experienced a statistically significant treatment benefit (HR ⫽
0.66, 95% CI ⫽ 0.44–0.97, p ⫽ 0.04). Nevertheless, Ps for
heterogeneity and interaction were not statistically significant.

The report by Clark et al. (7), which described a more
extensive analysis of incident prostate cancer in the 1983–1993
dataset, indicated that the effect of selenium supplementation
was strongest among participants with the lowest baseline
plasma selenium concentrations (RR ⫽ 0.08, P ⫽ 0.002 for
individuals with baseline plasma selenium concentrations
⬍106.4 ng/ml). We investigated the association between sele-
nium supplementation and the incidence of total cancer across
strata of baseline plasma selenium (Table 5). A statistically
significant inverse association between selenium supplementa-
tion and total cancer incidence was apparent in participants
below the median baseline selenium (HR ⫽ 0.62, 95% CI ⫽
0.43– 0.90, P ⫽ 0.01), whereas those above the median value at
baseline experienced a nonsignificant reduction in incidence
(HR ⫽ 0.91, 95% CI ⫽ 0.63–1.30, P ⫽ 0.60). However, a
significant interaction between treatment group and baseline
plasma selenium divided by the median concentration was not
apparent (P for interaction ⫽ 0.14).

plasma selenium concentrations to the subsequent development
of total cancer. HRs were calculated using three different ex-

selenium and the incidence of total cancer is seen within the
selenium group for the continuous, dichotomous, and trichot-
omous analyses of baseline selenium concentrations. When
baseline plasma selenium is treated as a continuous variable,

selenium supplementation increased total cancer incidence by
12% (HR ⫽ 0.12, 95% CI ⫽ 1.03–1.22, P ⫽ 0.005) for every
unit (where 1 unit ⫽ 10 ng/ml) increase in baseline plasma
selenium concentration. When selenium is treated as a dichot-
omous variable, the comparison of total cancers above the
median with those below the median yielded a HR of 1.45 (95%
CI ⫽ 0.98 –2.15, P ⫽ 0.06). Using the first baseline selenium
tertile as the referent group among selenium-supplemented
subjects, the HR was 1.29 (95% CI ⫽ 0.78 –2.15, P ⫽ 0.32) in
the second tertile and 1.88 (95% CI ⫽ 1.15–3.05, P ⫽ 0.01) in
the third tertile of baseline plasma selenium. The trend for this
association was statistically significant (P ⫽ 0.01). Thus, the
trichotomous analysis revealed that among selenium-supple-
mented participants, those in the third tertile experienced an
almost 2-fold, statistically significant elevation of incidence
compared with participants in the first tertile.

The association of baseline plasma selenium and total
cancer in the placebo group, albeit weak, was in the protective
direction, with individuals of higher status showing a lower
incidence of total cancer (Table 6). There was a nonsignificant
decrease in incidence of total cancer with increasing baseline
selenium in increments of 10 ng/ml (HR ⫽ 0.97, 95% CI ⫽
0.90 –1.05, P ⫽ 0.49). The decrease in incidence was also
nonsignificant when comparing the effects of baseline selenium
above the median, as opposed to below the median (HR ⫽ 0.95,
95% CI ⫽ 0.68 –1.34, P ⫽ 0.79). This nonsignificant reduction
in total cancer incidence is again apparent in the comparison of
tertiles of baseline plasma selenium. Using the first tertile as the
referent group, the HR was 0.88 (95% CI ⫽ 0.59 –1.31, P ⫽
0.52) in the second and 0.76 (95% CI ⫽ 0.50 –1.16, P ⫽ 0.20)
in the third tertile. The P for trend in this trichotomous analysis
was 0.20.

Discussion
The NPC Trial is the only double-blind, placebo-controlled, ran-
domized trial to date to have tested the effect of selenium supple-
mentation on cancer incidence in a Western population. The orig-
inal secondary analyses of the NPC data showed a highly
significant inverse association of selenium supplementation with
the incidence of total cancer through December 31, 1993, over a
mean period of 6.4 years of follow-up (1). In this report, we
describe analyses of the effect of selenium supplementation on
total cancer incidence through the end of randomized, blinded
treatment (February 1, 1996). This extended follow-up attenuated
the protective effect of selenium supplementation on total cancer
incidence, although selenium supplementation continued to reduce
the incidence of total cancer over a mean follow-up of more than
7 years. A significant inverse association with the most common
cancer, prostate cancer, was observed. For the next most common
sites, lung and colorectal cancers, respectively, inverse but non-
significant associations with selenium supplementation and inci-
dence were determined. These results are consistent with the
majority of epidemiological studies that support the efficacy of
selenium as a chemopreventive agent against all cancers (8–16)
and prostate (17–19), lung (12, 20–24), and colorectal cancers
(25–28). However, not all epidemiological trials consistently
support a protective association between selenium and cancer
(26, 29 – 41).

Of the remaining eight cancer sites evaluated in this report,
nonsignificant reductions in incidence were apparent in three
categories: (a) other carcinomas; (b) other noncarcinomas; and
(c) esophageal cancer. Results from epidemiological trials on
these three cancer categories have been inconsistent (41– 45).
Conversely, nonsignificant increases in incidence were

evident in five cancer types, including melanoma, bladder can-
cer, breast cancer, head and neck cancer, and lymphoma and
leukemia. These results, although nonsignificant and based on
small case numbers, may indicate potential increased risk with
selenium supplementation. Previous reports on the effects of
selenium on melanoma (24, 46 – 49), bladder cancer (33, 48,
50), head and neck cancer (51–53), and lymphoma and leuke-
mia (24, 37, 41, 54) in epidemiological trials have been varied.
The evidence associating selenium status and breast cancer is
conflicting. Analogous to that observed in the NPC Trial,
several prospective studies have shown nonsignificant positive
associations between serum (24) and toenail (55, 56) selenium
status and breast cancer. However, the lack of an association
between serum (57), toenail (58), and four indicators (59) of
selenium status and breast cancer risk has been suggested by
several case-control studies. Similarly, several prospective tri-
als have shown equivocal associations between serum (37, 60)
and toenail (61) selenium status and breast cancer risk. Many
case-control studies have suggested a protective effect of higher
selenium status (26, 62, 63) in postmenopausal but not pre-
menopausal women (64). In addition, inverse trends between
breast cancer and selenium concentrations in serum (29), toe-
nails (65), and drinking water (41) have been suggested in
prospective trials, although results were nonsignificant. More-
over, significant inverse associations between breast cancer risk
and serum (66 – 68) and hair (23) selenium have been docu-
mented.

Methodological issues, primarily the difficulty of assess-
ing long-term selenium exposure, may explain some of the
inconsistencies in the association of selenium and cancer re-
ported from epidemiological trials (69). In addition, treatment
and disease may alter selenium status and thus may lead to
temporal ambiguity and misclassification of selenium status.
Nevertheless, a meta-analysis of cohort studies comparing as-
sociations of serum selenium, retinol, ␤-carotene, and vitamin
E with cancer suggests that selenium has a remarkably consist-
ent protective effect (70).

Furthermore, evidence for the chemopreventive efficacy of
selenium has been consistently represented in laboratory trials,
although the exact mechanism(s) of its activity is unclear. The
overwhelming majority of in vivo studies in rodents have shown
that various forms of selenium inhibit carcinogen-induced co-
valent DNA adduct formation and retard oxidative damage to
DNA, lipids, and proteins at multiple organ sites (71). In vitro and
in vivo systems have shown that tumor cell growth, cell prolifer-
ation, and cell cycle biomarkers; apoptosis; p53 expression;
cyclooxygenase 2 expression; DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis;
the activation of transcriptional factors activator protein 1 and
nuclear factor ␬B; the activities of protein kinase C and protein
kinase A, thymidine kinase, c-Jun-NH2-kinase, and DNA cytosine
methyltransferase; and 8-isoprostane formation are modified by
various forms of selenium treatment (71).
Effect Modification. Several potential effect modifiers for the
effect of selenium supplementation on total cancer were pre-
sented in this analysis, including age at baseline, gender, and
baseline smoking and plasma selenium statuses. Our data sug-
gest that gender and baseline plasma selenium status predict the
effect of selenium supplementation on total cancer.
Gender. The high proportion of males in the trial reflects the
higher age-adjusted incidence of NMSC among men living in
the United States (for BCC, 247/100,000 PY for males and
150/100,000 PY for females; for SCC, 65/100,000 and 24/
100,000 PY for males and females, respectively) (72). The
difference in the participation of women also reflects the reli-

Se Supplementation and Cancer Incidence: The NPC Trial

ance on three Veterans Administration hospitals for subject
recruitment, where there was an overwhelming preponderance
of males among the potentially eligible patients. Whereas the
recruitment of patients was gender blind, it is likely that the
lower number of females in the trial and their lower incidence
of cancer limited the power to investigate the interaction be-
tween gender and treatment. Thus, the apparent interaction
between gender and treatment was not statistically significant,
and the overall protective treatment effect was detectable only
among males. Moreover, although the effect in men appeared to
be concentrated in those whose baseline plasma selenium con-
centrations were below the median or in the lowest tertiles,
baseline plasma selenium status did not modify the treatment
effect among women (data not shown).

This discrepancy in the effect of selenium supplementa-
tion on cancer protection by gender has also been noted else-
where. A case-control study of total cancer mortality nested
within a prospective trial of 10,532 persons in the Netherlands
showed that among males, the mean serum selenium for cases
was significantly less than that for controls and that the adjusted
risk of cancer mortality for the lowest quintile of serum sele-
nium (⬍100.8 ng/ml) was more than twice that of men with
higher concentrations (RR ⫽ 2.7, 90% CI ⫽ 1.2– 6.2; Ref. 30).
In females, however, selenium concentrations were similar
among cases and controls, with no evidence of increased cancer
mortality associated with low serum selenium (30). Similar
results were observed in a longitudinal study of 39,268 men and
women participating in the Finnish Social Insurance Institu-
tion’s Mobile Clinic Health Examination Survey (29).

Effect modification by gender may be attributed in part to
gender differences in selenium metabolism. In a European
study, females excreted significantly higher amounts of sele-
nium per kilogram of body weight compared with males (73).
Furthermore, whole-body residence time and body load ad-
justed for body weight have been estimated to be greater in
males than females (74). Patterson et al. (74) speculated that
these gender differences might reflect hormonal differences and
the strong affinity of the testes for selenium. Thus, future
chemoprevention trials may need to consider dose adjustments
for gender (74) or whether large numbers of women should be
included in the study samples. Clearly, we need to further
evaluate how gender may modify the effect of selenium on
cancer outcomes.
Smoking. After adjustment for age and gender, selenium sup-
plementation was associated with a statistically significant re-
duction in total cancer incidence among former smokers and
with nonsignificant reductions among never and current smok-
ers. This is consistent with the proposal that former smokers are
an ideal target population for chemoprevention trials (75, 76).
The ␣-Tocopherol ␤-Carotene Cancer Prevention Study Group
(77) documented a nonsignificant reduction in lung cancer
incidence with ␣-tocopherol and increased lung cancer inci-
dence with ␤-carotene in heavy current smokers. Cumulative
and continuing exposure to tobacco smoke may have over-
whelmed the effect of chemopreventive agents usually associ-
ated with early initiation and promotion stages of carcinogen-
esis (78).
Baseline Plasma Selenium. Clark et al. (1) reported that se-
lenium supplementation had the greatest effect on prostate
cancer prevention in men from this trial with the lowest base-
line plasma selenium status. In the current analyses, the pro-
tective effect of treatment on total cancer incidence was like-
wise confined to participants in the lowest tertile of baseline
plasma selenium. Moreover, a formal interaction between base-

line plasma selenium by tertile and treatment was detected in
this analysis. Modification of the association between treatment
and cancer incidence by baseline status of the supplemented
nutrient is strikingly similar to the treatment effects for prostate
cancer observed in the PHS (79, 80). Within the placebo group
of the PHS, those in the lowest versus the highest quartile of
baseline plasma ␤-carotene experienced a marginally signifi-
cant increased risk of prostate cancer (RR ⫽ 1.45, 95% CI ⫽
0.98 –2.15), with a marginally significant P for trend over
plasma quartiles. However, men in the lowest quartile randomly
assigned to ␤-carotene supplementation had a significant re-
duction in prostate cancer risk (RR ⫽ 0.68, 95% CI ⫽ 0.46 –
0.99) compared with those assigned to placebo. Supplementa-
tion of those in the highest baseline quartile was associated with
a nonsignificant increase in risk (RR ⫽ 1.33, 95% CI ⫽
0.91–1.96). Thus, ␤-carotene supplementation in the PHS re-
duced the risk of prostate cancer only among those individuals
with low baseline plasma ␤-carotene levels.

In the current analysis of the NPC Trial, attempts to glean
information on the nature of the effect modification of selenium
treatment by baseline plasma selenium reveal a complex and
confusing pattern, one that is not entirely consistent with our
understanding of selenium as protective against cancer. Indeed,
these results clearly indicate the lack of a protective effect
among participants whose baseline plasma selenium concen-
trations were in the upper tertile. It is noteworthy that this group
of participants was selected on the basis of residency in an area
in which the selenium intake was likely to be lower than in
other regions of the United States. Thus, these results provide
little support for the use of 200 ␮g selenium/day to protect
against cancer among average-risk individuals with plasma
concentrations at or above the United States estimated average
of 123 ng/ml (mean ⫾ SD serum selenium in 16,693 subjects
obtained from the Third National Health and Nutrition Exam-
ination Survey (NHANES III) was 123 ⫾ 17 ng/ml (81).

In addition, among selenium-supplemented individuals,
we observe a striking association; those with higher baseline
concentrations experienced an elevated incidence of cancer. A
pattern of modestly decreased incidence among placebo partic-
ipants coupled with no risk gradient among treated participants
seems somewhat plausible; however, the pattern we observed
was clearly unpredicted and unsettling. It is critical that this
effect be further evaluated in carefully controlled mechanistic
studies.

There are several limitations in this study. First, as men-
tioned earlier, total and site-specific cancers (excluding NMSC)
were not primary endpoints of the NPC Trial (82). Neverthe-
less,
the ascertainment of these endpoints did not change
throughout the entirety of the trial through February 1, 1996.
Second, this trial possessed differential statistical power to
detect an overall treatment effect in males versus females, as
well as for gender-specific cancers. An adequately powered
hypothesis-driven biomarker study should thus be conducted in
females, before women are included in large-scale chemopre-
vention trials with selenium. A third limitation is the inherent
difficulty in the assessment of selenium status. Due to varia-
tions in levels of the element between foodstuffs and the un-
certainty about the availability for absorption of the different
forms of the element, simple measures of dietary selenium
intake indicative of the general status of a population are not
sufficient for determining selenium status in individuals (83). It
is therefore necessary to measure biochemical concentrations of
selenium in the body and not simply gross intake (83). Ideally,
the combination of two or more indices of selenium status
would ensure a more accurate assessment. However, because

98.5% of the NPC participants had plasma selenium concen-
trations greater than the 70 –90 ng/ml required to maximize
plasma selenoproteins (84, 85), plasma selenium was the only
index used to measure selenium status in this trial. Although
plasma selenium concentrations reflect long-term selenium sta-
tus in populations with relatively constant selenium intakes, it
seems prudent that future selenium chemoprevention trials in-
clude multiple sequential plasma measures before randomiza-
tion to more accurately define an individual’s baseline plasma
selenium status.

Finally, although the incidence estimates were adjusted for
potential confounders such as age, gender, and smoking status,
the lack of detailed information on unmeasured risk factors
such as family history of cancer, physical activity level, bio-
chemical status of other nutrients, and dietary intake data from
foods and alcohol
is a possible limitation. Randomization
should minimize the likelihood of confounding by these factors.
However, it is noteworthy that, during 1994 –1995, plasma
selenium concentrations measured in 1134 British people ages
65 years and over were strongly and directly correlated with
plasma zinc, cholesterol, vitamin C, several carotenoids, and
␣-tocopherol, independent of age (86). Thus, future investiga-
tions of this cohort will consider the impact of other antioxi-
dants, including the tocopherols and carotenoids, on cancer
incidence and the extent to which they may modulate the effect
of selenium supplementation. In addition, we plan to conduct
genotype analyses on the study cohort to determine the effect of
selenium supplementation on the activity of the inducible en-
zyme thiolmethyltransferase, which is critical in the methyla-
tion of selenium compounds; the prevalence of genetic poly-
morphisms of key genes
in selenium and carcinogen
metabolism, including thiolmethyltransferase, classical gluta-
thione peroxidase (GSHPx-1; Refs. 87 and 88), and the recently
identified Mr 15,000 selenoprotein (89); and the effect of these
polymorphisms on cancer incidence and response to selenium
supplementation.

In conclusion, this summary analysis of the NPC Trial,
which includes data from the entire period of blinded treatment,
continues to provide support for the efficacy of selenium sup-
plementation in reducing total cancer incidence, total cancer
mortality, and the incidence of prostate cancer and, to a lesser
extent, lung and colorectal cancer. Not all site-specific cancers
exhibited a reduction in incidence, although small case numbers
limit the precision of our data. Indeed, the incidences of several
site-specific cancers, including breast cancer, were nonsignifi-
cantly increased with an average of 7.4 years of follow-up. The
protective effect of selenium supplementation on total cancer
incidence was most prominent in males and in those with lower
baseline plasma selenium concentrations. Those participants
with baseline plasma selenium concentrations above the United
States average showed a nonsignificant elevated incidence of
total cancer. Our data suggest that effect modification of the
association between selenium supplementation and cancer in-
cidence (and/or biomarkers of carcinogenesis) by baseline
plasma selenium status should be monitored and assessed in
ongoing and future selenium prevention trials including those
underway at the University of Arizona (90) and the recently
initiated Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial (91).
Future research studies should evaluate selenium metab-
olism and the effect of supplementation on genetic biomarkers
of cancer risk in males and females to identify disparities that
may account for the apparent differences in the chemopreven-
tive effects of selenium between genders. Future studies should
also assess the effect of selenium supplementation on these
biomarkers in populations of varying selenium status both

within the United States and around the world to help elucidate
the mechanism by which selenium status mediates the chemo-
preventive activity of this element.

Abstract

Although experimental data suggest a potentially protective involvement of dietary ﬁber in prostate carcinogenesis, very

few prospective studies have investigated the relation between dietary ﬁber intake and prostate cancer risk, and those

have had inconsistent results. Our objective was to study the association between dietary ﬁber intake (overall, insoluble,

soluble, and from different sources, such as cereals, vegetables, fruits, and legumes) and prostate cancer risk.

Stratiﬁcations by excess weight status, insulin-like growth factors, and amount of alcohol intake were also considered.

This prospective analysis included 3313 men from the Suppl ´ementation en Vitamines et Min ´eraux Antioxydants (SU.VI.

MAX) cohort who completed at least 3 24-h dietary records. One hundred thirty-nine incident prostate cancers were

diagnosed between 1994 and 2007 (median follow-up of 12.6 y). Associations between quartiles of energy-adjusted

dietary ﬁber intake and prostate cancer risk were characterized by multivariate Cox proportional hazards models. Prostate

cancer risk was inversely associated with total dietary ﬁber intake (HR of quartile 4 vs. quartile 1 = 0.47; 95% CI: 0.27, 0.81;
P = 0.001), insoluble (HR = 0.46; 95% CI: 0.27, 0.78; P = 0.001), and legume (HR = 0.55; 95% CI: 0.32, 0.95; P = 0.04) ﬁber
intakes. In contrast, we found no association between prostate cancer risk and soluble (P = 0.1), cereal (P = 0.7), vegetable
(P = 0.9), and fruit (P = 0.4) ﬁber intakes. In conclusion, dietary ﬁber intake (total, insoluble, and from legumes but not soluble or

from cereals, vegetables, and fruits) was inversely associated with prostate cancer risk, consistent with mechanistic data. This

trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00272428. J. Nutr. 144: 504–510, 2014.

Introduction

Several mechanisms are involved in prostate cancer develop-
ment. First, experimental (1–3) and epidemiologic (3,4) data
suggest that chronic inﬂammation stimulates prostate carcino-
genesis. Second, insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia, which
lead to several metabolic modiﬁcations, such as higher insulin-
like growth factor (IGF)6-1 and IGF-2 bioactivity and lower sex-
hormone binding globulin (SHBG) concentrations (1,5,6), have

been associated with increased risk of prostate cancer in
experimental (5,7) and epidemiologic (7–11) studies. Finally,
increased concentrations of circulating estrogens and androgens
could be related to a greater risk of prostate cancer (12).

Experimental data suggested that dietary ﬁber may do the
following: 1) have anti-inﬂammatory properties (13–15); 2)
improve insulin sensitivity (16,17) and reduce IGF bioactivity,
notably by increasing insulin-like growth factor binding
protein (IGFBP) 3 concentrations (18); 3) upregulate SHBG
concentration (19); and 4) inﬂuence steroid hormone concen-
trations by decreasing circulating estrogens and androgens
(20,21), thereby supporting the hypothesis that dietary ﬁber
has a protective effect against prostate carcinogenesis.

In 2007, the World Cancer Research Fund (WCRF)/American
Institute for Cancer Research considered that the epidemiologic
evidence of an association between dietary ﬁber intake and
prostate cancer risk was too limited to allow a conclusion (22),
because only 1 unadjusted null-result prospective cohort study
was available (23). Since then, 3 prospective studies on dietary
ﬁber and prostate cancer risk have been published (24–26).
Overall, they did not detect any relation (24–26), except for an
inverse association observed in the European Prospective

Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) cohort study for
fruit ﬁber among men aged $65 y (26). However, these studies
(25,26) used FFQs to assess dietary ﬁber intakes, which may
weaken associations between food intakes and health outcomes
(27,28). Thus, new prospective studies are needed to further
investigate the relation between dietary ﬁber intake and prostate
cancer risk. In addition, ‘‘dietary ﬁber’’ refers to a large category
of molecules with various biochemical properties (such as
solubility) and fermentation products, probably resulting in
differential physiologic effects on the management of inﬂam-
mation, insulin resistance, or circulating steroid hormones and,
thus, prostate carcinogenesis (29,30). Nonetheless, only 1 pro-
spective study on prostate cancer risk has investigated separately
the different sources of dietary ﬁber (26), and none has
distinguished soluble and insoluble ﬁbers.

Furthermore, to our knowledge, previous prospective studies
on dietary ﬁber and prostate cancer risk did not take into
account IGF concentrations or stratify for alcohol intake, and
only 1 considered stratiﬁcation by BMI with null result (25).
Because overweight and obesity are linked to a low-grade
chronic inﬂammation status (2,6), IGF-1 and IGF-2 concentra-
tions are related to prostate cancer risk (7–10), and alcohol
intake is associated with higher concentrations of circulating
estrogens (31), we hypothesized that excess weight, IGF-1 and
IGF-2 concentrations, and alcohol intake may modulate the
association between dietary ﬁber intake and prostate cancer risk.
Hence, our objective was to prospectively investigate the
association between different types of dietary ﬁber (overall,
insoluble, soluble, and from different food sources, such as
cereals, vegetables, fruits, and legumes) and prostate cancer risk
using repeated dietary records, and explore its potential mod-
ulation by overweight/obesity status, IGF-1 and IGF-2 plasma

Participants. The Suppl´ementation en Vitamines et Min´eraux Anti-
oxydants (SU.VI.MAX) study was at ﬁrst designed as a randomized,
double-blind, placebo-controlled primary prevention trial (registered at
clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00272428) aiming to assess the effect of daily
supplementation with nutritional doses of antioxidants on the incidence
of cardiovascular diseases and cancers (32). In 1994–1995, 13,017
individuals (7876 women and 5141 men) were enrolled for an 8-y
intervention study. Follow-up of health events lasted until September
2007. The SU.VI.MAX study was conducted according to the Declara-
tion of Helsinki guidelines and was approved by the Paris-Cochin Hospital
Ethics Committee for Studies with Human Subjects (CCPPRB nos. 706 and
2364, respectively) and the French National Commission for Computed
Data and Individual Freedom (CNIL nos. 334641 and 907094, respec-
tively). Written informed consent was obtained from all participants.

Baseline data collection.
Information about sociodemographics,
smoking status, physical activity, and family history of prostate cancer
were collected by self-administered questionnaires for all participants at
enrollment. Anthropometric measures were obtained during a medical
examination by the study nurses and physicians.

Every 2 mo during the trial phase (1994–2002), participants were
invited to complete a 24-h dietary record via the Minitel Telematic
Network, a French telephone-based terminal equivalent to an Internet
prototype used widely at the beginning of the study. The records were
randomly distributed between weeks and weekends and over seasons to
take into account intra-individual variability. Participants assessed
portion sizes with the aid of a validated picture booklet (33), and the
amounts consumed from composite dishes were estimated using French
recipes validated by food and nutrition professionals. The mean daily
energy, alcohol, and nutrient intakes were estimated using a published

French food composition table (34). Total dietary ﬁber and soluble ﬁber
contents were obtained using the Association of Ofﬁcial Analytical
Chemists method (35). Dietary ﬁber intakes in the SU.VI.MAX study
were described previously (36). During the trial phase, participants were
advised against taking any self-prescribed supplementation. Fiber intake
from supplements is therefore most likely negligible in our study.

In the SU.VI.MAX cohort, a study was conducted to validate an FFQ
that was completed by the participants in 2007. This FFQ was compared
with 12 dietary records across 1 y (considered as the reference method).
Energy-adjusted deattenuated correlation coefﬁcients for total dietary
ﬁber intake between this FFQ and the 12 dietary records were 0.56 for
men and 0.63 for women (37). These coefﬁcients were similar to those
found in the EPIC cohort (0.54) (38).

A 35 mL fasting venous blood sample was collected in vacutainer
tubes. Blood samples were centrifuged immediately after blood draw,
and plasma aliquots were then preserved in sodium heparin. Less than
1 h after blood draw, plasma aliquots were stored at 220°C in dry ice for
shipment to the central biobank (maximum of 24 h), where they were
stored frozen in liquid nitrogen. These plasma samples were used to
determine the baseline concentrations of selenium, total prostate-speciﬁc
antigen (PSA) measured by immunoassay (Roche Diagnostics), IGF-
1 measured by immunometry on a Immulite analyzer (Diagnostics
Products Corporation), and IGF-2 measured by immunoradiometric
assays (Diagnostic Systems Laboratories). Coefﬁcients of variation for
the laboratory assays were 5.5% for total PSA, 5.3% for IGF-1, and
6.8% for IGF-2. Total PSA, IGF-1, and IGF-2 baseline concentrations
were measured in 2002–2003 as part of a post hoc research protocol
(39,40). The SU.VI.MAX investigators contacted the participants and
their treating physicians if their baseline PSA value was >4.0 mg/L.
Additional medical investigations were left to the discretion of the
treating physician (40).

Case ascertainment. During the follow-up period, participants were
invited to self-report health events (through a monthly questionnaire).
Investigations were then conducted to obtain medical data from
participants, physicians, and/or hospitals. All information was reviewed
by an independent physician expert committee, and cases were validated
with the pathologic reports and classiﬁed using the International Chronic
Diseases Classiﬁcation, 10th Revision, Clinical Modiﬁcation (41).
Cancers were validated by histologic reports, and all prostate cancer
cases were documented by a pathology report (32,39). All ﬁrst-incident
primary prostate cancers were considered as cases in this study.

Statistical analyses. From the 5141 male participants in the SU.VI.
MAX study, we excluded 41 men who reported a cancer diagnosis before
the start of the follow-up. Among the remaining participants, 3313
provided at least 3 valid 24-h dietary records within the ﬁrst 2 years of
follow-up and thus remained available for analysis. Participants
contributed person-time until the date of diagnosis of prostate cancer,
the date of last completed questionnaire, the date of death, or September
2007, whichever occurred ﬁrst. Participants who reported a cancer other
than prostate cancer during the study period (n = 163) were included and
censored at the date of diagnosis (except those with basal cell skin
carcinoma, which was not considered to be cancer). Nutrient intakes
were estimated by the mean intake calculated from all dietary records for
each man.

Baseline characteristics of participants were compared between
quartiles of total dietary ﬁber intake using x2 tests or Fisher tests
(ANOVA models). HRs and 95% CIs obtained from Cox proportional
hazards models, with age as the primary time variable, were used to
characterize the association between quartiles of dietary ﬁber intake and
incident of prostate cancer. We conﬁrmed that the assumptions of
proportionality were satisﬁed through examination of the log–log
(survival) vs. log–time plots. Different categories of dietary ﬁber were
tested according to their chemical properties (soluble and insoluble
ﬁbers) and according to their food sources (cereal, vegetable, fruit, and
legume ﬁbers). Tests for linear trend were performed using the ordinal
score on quartiles of ﬁber intake. Correlations between the different
types of dietary ﬁber intakes were analyzed using Spearman correlation
coefﬁcients. Multivariate models were adjusted for factors constitutive

to the study design [initial SU.VI.MAX trial intervention group (yes/no),
number of dietary records (continuous)], major sociodemographic
variables [age (timescale) and educational level (primary, secondary, or
university)], lifestyle factors [smoking status (never, former, or current),
physical activity (irregular, <1 h/d or $1 h/d walking or equivalent), and
alcohol intake (continuous)], anthropometric factors [height (continu-
ous) and BMI
factors indicating higher individual
susceptibility to prostate cancer [family history of prostate cancer (yes/
no) and baseline PSA concentration (continuous), as done previously
(4)], and dietary factors [dietary intakes of energy without alcohol,
calcium, processed meat, tomato products, and vitamin E (continuous)
and plasma selenium concentration (continuous)]. These factors were
those for which the association with prostate cancer risk was
established or suggested according to the 2007 WCRF report (22).
Adjustment for without-alcohol energy intake was performed by the
residual method (42). Stratiﬁed analyses were performed according to
overweight/obesity status (BMI <25 vs. $25 kg/m2), IGF-1 [<155 vs.
$155 mg/L (median)], and IGF-2 [<1078 vs. $1078 mg/L (median)]
intake [<23.4 vs. $23.4 g/d
plasma concentrations, and alcohol
(median)]. Interactions between these variables and quartiles of each

type of dietary ﬁber were tested by introducing the product of the
2 variables in the models. Interaction with the SU.VI.MAX trial
antioxidant supplementation group was also tested. All tests were
2 sided, and P < 0.05 was considered statistically signiﬁcant. SAS
version 9.3 (SAS Institute) was used for analyses.

Results

During a median follow-up of 12.6 y (37,877 person-years),
139 men developed a ﬁrst primary prostate cancer with a mean
age at diagnosis of 63 y. A total of 5.2% of the participants were
lost to follow-up. Table 1 presents the characteristics of the
participants according to quartiles of total dietary ﬁber intake.
Participants in the upper quartile tended to be older, taller, non-
smokers, more active physically, and had lower BMIs. The mean
dietary ﬁber intake was 21 6 7.3 g/d. Only 25% of the study
population reached the 25 g/d minimal French recommendation
(43). Main contributors to dietary ﬁber intake were cereals

(39.7%), vegetables (20.8%), fruits (19.8%), and legumes
(6.5%). Main contributors to insoluble ﬁber intake were cereals
(42%), vegetables (20%), fruits (20%), and legumes (7%), and
main contributors to soluble ﬁber intake were cereals (30%),
vegetables (26%), fruits (20%), and legumes (4%). The proportion
of insoluble/soluble ﬁber in each food source was as follows: 90/
10% for legumes, 84/16% for fruits (including nuts), 83/17% for
cereal products, and 74/26% for vegetables, respectively. Spearman
correlation coefﬁcients between the different types of ﬁber are
presented in Table 2. The ﬁber source with the highest correlation
with soluble ﬁber was vegetable ﬁber (Spearman r = 0.61, P <
0.05), and the ﬁber source with the highest correlation with
insoluble ﬁber was cereal ﬁber (Spearman r = 0.73, P < 0.05).

Table 3 summarizes the associations between dietary ﬁber
intake and prostate cancer risk. An inverse association was
found between prostate cancer risk and quartiles of total dietary
ﬁber intake (P = 0.001), insoluble ﬁber intake (P = 0.001), and
legume ﬁber intake (P = 0.04). No association was observed
between prostate cancer risk and quartiles of soluble ﬁber (P =
0.1), cereal ﬁber (P = 0.7), vegetable ﬁber (P = 0.9), and fruit
ﬁber (P = 0.4) intakes.

Legume intake (cutoffs for quartiles of the energy-adjusted
legume intake: 5.0, 16.3, and 34.1 g/d) was also associated with
decreased prostate cancer risk in our study (HR of quartile 4 vs.
quartile 1 = 0.48; 95% CI: 0.28, 0.83; P = 0.02; data not tabulated).
Although no interaction was statistically signiﬁcant between
ﬁber intake and BMI, IGFs, and alcohol intake, differences were
observed in stratiﬁed analyses (despite similar numbers of
participants in the compared groups). Total,
insoluble, and
legume ﬁber intakes were associated with decreased prostate
cancer risk in men with higher alcohol intake but not in men
with alcohol intake below the population median. The associ-
ation between legume ﬁber intake and prostate cancer risk
also tended to be stronger in overweight men and in those with
higher IGF-2 concentrations compared with normal-weight men
and those with IGF-2 amounts below the population median
(Supplemental Tables 1–4).

In sensitivity analyses, results remained unchanged after
exclusion of incident cases diagnosed within the ﬁrst 4 y of
follow-up (118 cases in 3292 men) or when considering only
men who completed more than 6 24-h dietary records during the
ﬁrst 2 y of follow-up (123 cases in 2771 men). Likewise, there
was no modiﬁcation when excluding soy and soy products from
legumes (for the association between legume ﬁber and prostate
cancer risk, HR of quartile 4 vs. quartile 1 = 0.56; 95% CI: 0.33,
0.97; P = 0.03), when adjusting for dairy product intake instead
of calcium intake or when including without-alcohol energy
intake (kilocalories per day) in all our models in addition to the

Discussion

In a context of scarce literature on the topic, this prospective
study investigated the association between different types of
dietary ﬁber and prostate cancer risk. We observed that total
dietary ﬁber intake and more speciﬁcally insoluble and legume
ﬁber intakes were associated with reduced prostate cancer risk.
In addition, to our knowledge, this study was the ﬁrst to consider
stratiﬁcation by IGF-1 or IGF-2 concentrations and by alcohol
intake and only the second to consider BMI subgroups despite
plausible mechanistic hypotheses. Although interactions were
not statistically signiﬁcant and overall similar trends were observed
in the studied subgroups, associations tended to be slightly stronger
in overweight/obese men and in those with IGF-2 concentra-
tions (legume ﬁber intake) and alcohol intake higher than the
population median (total, insoluble, and legume ﬁber intakes).
The few available prospective studies (23–26) showed
contrasting results. Three of them did not detect any association
between total dietary ﬁber intake and prostate cancer risk (23–
25), but no distinction was made between the type and source of
dietary ﬁber in these studies, and 1 of these studies provided only
unadjusted results (23). In men $65 y in the EPIC cohort, a
statistically signiﬁcant inverse association was observed between
fruit ﬁber and prostate cancer risk (26). A potential explanation
for these discrepancies could lie in the dietary assessment
method. Repeated 24-h dietary records (at least 3, mean of 9.7 6
3.3) were used in the present study, whereas other prospective
studies used an FFQ (25,26), which may attenuate the estimated
relative risks, as observed in 2 recent prospective studies on
dietary ﬁber intake and colorectal cancer risk (27) and on dietary
ﬁber intake and coronary heart disease risk (28). In these studies,
food diaries and FFQs were used within the same study
population, and statistically signiﬁcant associations were ob-
served when dietary ﬁber was measured by food diaries but not
by FFQs.

Our results are supported by mechanistic data. First, exper-
imental data suggested that inﬂammation has a pro-carcinigenic
role in prostate cancer development (1–3,44). Consistently, in a
prospective case-control study nested in the present cohort,
we observed previously that prediagnostic high sensitivity
C-reactive protein plasma concentration was directly associated
with increased prostate cancer risk (4). Experimental studies
showed that dietary ﬁbers exert a down-regulation role on
inﬂammation (15,45), probably through the production of
short-chain FAs when ﬁbers are fermented in the colon (46).
Fermentation products, particularly butyrate (47) and propio-
nate (48), have shown anti-inﬂammatory properties. Soluble
ﬁbers are highly fermentable, and colonic fermentation of
resistant starch, an insoluble ﬁber type, seems to produce
substantial amounts of butyrate (49) that enter the circulation
(50), thereby exerting anti-inﬂammatory activity.

Second, experimental studies also suggested that insulin
resistance and hyperinsulinemia, by increasing IGF concentra-
tions, may stimulate prostate carcinogenesis (5). Dietary ﬁber
may not be directly associated with IGF concentrations, but
several studies suggested that soluble ﬁber, insoluble ﬁber, and
resistant starch in particular may reduce insulin resistance
(16,17), notably through a decrease in carbohydrate absorption
rate (30,49,51), and increase IGFBP3 concentrations (18),
leading to decreased IGF bioactivity (1,5).

2 Cutoffs for quartiles of energy-adjusted dietary ﬁber intakes were 17.6, 20.4, and 23.7 g/d for total ﬁber; 14, 16.3, and 19 g/d for insoluble ﬁber; 3.4, 4, and 4.8 g/d for soluble
ﬁber; 6.6, 7.9, and 9.6 g/d for cereal ﬁber; 3, 4.1, and 5.5 g/d for vegetable ﬁber; 2.2, 3.7, and 5.6 g/d for fruit ﬁber; and 0.2, 0.8, and 2 g/d for legume ﬁber.
3 The crude model is adjusted for age (timescale), energy intake without alcohol (residual method), intervention group, and number of 24-h dietary records.
4 The multivariate model is adjusted for age (timescale), energy intake without alcohol, intervention group, number of 24-h dietary records, smoking status, educational level,
physical activity, height, BMI, alcohol intake, family history of prostate cancer, prostate-speciﬁc antigen, calcium intake, processed meat intake, tomato product intake, vitamin E
intake, and blood selenium.

Finally, increased concentrations of circulating androgenic or
estrogenic hormones could be associated with a greater risk of
prostate cancer (12). Dietary ﬁber may reduce concentrations of
circulating estrogens and androgens, notably through increased
SHBG concentration (19), modiﬁed enterohepatic circulation of
steroid hormones (decreased reabsorption of deconjugated
molecules) (30,52,53), and increased fecal excretion of these
hormones, resulting from binding to insoluble ﬁbers (21).

In this study, we observed an inverse association between
legume ﬁber intake and prostate cancer risk. Legume intake (in
grams per day) was also signiﬁcantly associated with a decreased
prostate cancer risk in our analyses, which was consistent with
the suggested inverse association between legume intake and
prostate cancer risk in the 2007 WCRF meta-analyses (22). It
may be difﬁcult to disentangle the effect of legume ﬁber from the
potential effect of other components found in legumes. Notably,
a role of soy phytoestrogens has been postulated to explain this
association (22). However, in our study, soy and soy product
intakes were very low; thus, they were not likely to entirely
explain the association between legumes and prostate cancer
risk. Furthermore, one prospective study (54) observed a signif-
icant inverse association between legume intake and prostate

508 Deschasaux et al.

cancer risk even after exclusion of soy, suggesting that phytoes-
trogens might not be the only explanation for the observed
association. In addition, mechanistic data support a potential role
of legume ﬁber in prostate cancer risk reduction because legume
ﬁber intake has been associated with improved glucose tolerance
(49), which may reduce prostate cancer risk (5). Moreover,
because legume ﬁber is mainly insoluble (49,55), results with
respect to insoluble and legume ﬁber intakes are consistent. The
proportion of insoluble ﬁber in cereals is also high (83%),
although lower than in legumes (90%). In addition, legumes
have a higher mean ﬁber density than cereal products (3.5 vs. 0.9
g/100 kcal). In the mid 1990s, whole-grain product intakes were
low, especially in men (56); thus, ﬁber intake from cereals was
also accompanied by relatively high lipid, sugar, and energy
intake. Even if we adjusted for these cofactors, it may be difﬁcult
to disentangle ﬁber intake from intake of these other compo-
nents. In a recent study, Hansen et al. (57) observed a decreased
risk of colon cancer associated with high cereal ﬁber intake,
more speciﬁcally from high-ﬁber cereal products but not from
low-ﬁber cereal products. This suggests that dietary ﬁber intake
might be more beneﬁcial when ﬁber intake comes from high-
ﬁber sources. This may explain why we observed an inverse

association between prostate cancer risk and legume ﬁbers but
not cereal ﬁbers.

Results from stratiﬁed analyses (although exploratory) sup-
port the abovementioned mechanical hypotheses: inverse asso-
ciations between legume ﬁber consumption and prostate cancer
risk were stronger in overweight men (inﬂammation pathway)
and in men with IGF-2 (insulin-resistance pathway) above the
population median, and inverse associations were stronger
between total, insoluble, and legume ﬁber intakes and prostate
cancer risk in men with alcohol consumption (circulating
estrogens pathway) above the population median.

Our study presented several strengths that pertained to its
prospective design, the diversity of types and sources of dietary
ﬁber investigated, and its originality with respect to existing
literature, notably regarding stratiﬁcations by BMI status, IGFs
concentrations, and alcohol intake.

Nevertheless, some limitations should be acknowledged.
First, the relatively small number of cases may have limited our
ability to detect some of the hypothesized associations, espe-
cially in stratiﬁed analyses. However, this is unlikely to explain
the observed relations that were statistically signiﬁcant despite
the potential power limitation. Second, only 1 IGF concentra-
tion measurement was available at baseline, and no information
was available for IGFBP3 concentrations, even though such
information could have provided additional arguments in terms
of mechanisms involved. Also, it would have been interesting to
stratify our analyses according to the amount of circulating
estrogens, but this information was not available. Third, the
observed relations could be partly affected by unmeasured or
residual confounding. However, main potential confounding
factors for prostate cancer risk have been accounted for in this
study [notably lifestyle factors indicating ‘‘healthy behaviors,’’
anthropometric factors, established or suspected dietary factors
according to the 2007 WCRF report (22), and factors indicating
higher susceptibility to prostate cancer risk]. Thus, it is unlikely
that residual confounding explains entirely the observed asso-
ciations. Finally, in the SU.VI.MAX study, PSA was measured in
2002–2003 from all baseline plasma samples. This systematic
testing may have introduced differences between our population
study and the general French population, with higher diagnosis
probability and overrepresentation of early-stage prostate can-
cers. Another limitation of our study was that the Gleason score
was not coded for all participants and thus could not be analyzed
in association with ﬁber intake. Because it has been suggested
that risk factors may differ according to the stage and aggres-
siveness of prostate cancer (2), this aspect should be investigated
in future cohort studies.

In conclusion, this prospective study observed that dietary ﬁber
intake (total, insoluble, and from legumes) was inversely associated
with prostate cancer risk, consistent with mechanistic data. These
results suggest a potentially protective involvement of dietary ﬁber
intake in prostate carcinogenesis. This must be conﬁrmed by
additional mechanistic and prospective epidemiologic studies,
especially taking into account the grade of prostate cancers.

Interaction among Folate, Riboﬂavin, Genotype, and Cancer,
with Reference to Colorectal and Cervical Cancer1–3

Hilary J. Powers4
Human Nutrition Unit, University of Shefﬁeld, UK

ABSTRACT Epidemiological studies have linked low folate intake with an increased risk of epithelial cancers,
including colorectal cancer and cervical cancer. Riboﬂavin has received much less attention, but there is increasing
interest in the well-established role that ﬂavins play in folate metabolism and the possible synergy of a protective
effect between these 2 vitamins. Folate plays a key role in DNA synthesis, repair, and methylation, and this forms
the basis of mechanistic explanations for a putative role for folate in cancer prevention. The role of folate in these
processes may be modulated by genotype for the common C677T thermolabile variant of methylene tetrahydro-
folate reductase (MTHFR), homozygosity for which is associated with lower enzyme activity, lower plasma and red
blood cell folate, and elevated plasma homocysteine. Riboﬂavin, as FAD, is a cofactor for MTHFR and there is
evidently some interaction among riboﬂavin status, folate status, and genotype in determining plasma homocys-
teine, a functional marker of folate status. The MTHFR C677T polymorphism appears to interact with folate and
riboﬂavin in modulating cancer risk in a manner that varies according to cancer site. Most evidence points to a
protective effect of this polymorphism for risk of colorectal cancer, but the effect on cervical cancer risk is not clear.
The effect of this polymorphism on cancer risk seems to be further modulated by other factors, including alcohol
and, in the case of cervical cancer, infection with the human papilloma virus. An additional factor determining the
effect of diet and genotype interactions on cancer risk may be the stage of cancer development. J. Nutr. 135:

A signiﬁcant body of research suggests that a diet rich in
fruit and vegetables may protect against cancer at various sites.
Nutrients and nonnutrient plant compounds have been exam-
ined as putative factors in this protective process; among these
compounds folate has received a certain amount of attention,
especially with respect to epithelial cancers. Folate is an at-
tractive candidate in this context, because some epidemiolog-
ical studies have supported a protective role, and there are also
plausible explanatory mechanisms. Riboﬂavin has received
much less attention, but interest is increasing in the well-
established role that ﬂavins play in folate metabolism and the
possible synergy of a protective effect between these two

Folate and DNA stability

Folate, as 5,10-methylene tetrahydrofolate, is an essential
1-C donor in the synthesis of DNA and, as 5-methyl tetrahy-

occurs on cytosine residues in cytosine-guanine sequences
(CpGs),5 and the methylation proﬁle of DNA is evidently
important for carcinogenesis, although the reasons for this are
not fully understood. Hypomethylation of DNA is an early
feature of carcinogenesis (1,2). Feinberg and Vogelstein (3)
were among the ﬁrst to report DNA hypomethylation in
colorectal tumor tissue. Although folate is clearly important to
DNA methylation, the evidence that dietary folate depriva-
tion alone is sufﬁcient to cause hypomethylation in vivo has
not been unequivocally established, and any effects may in-
deed be tissue speciﬁc. Rats fed a methyl-deﬁcient diet showed
evidence of global DNA hypomethylation in the liver (4),
whereas folate deﬁciency in rats has been associated with
hypomethylation in the TP53 gene in tissue from the liver and

homocysteine to methionine and key to the provision of
S-adenosyl methionine for DNA (and other substrate) meth-
ylation. Individuals carrying the TT variant (homozygous)
show lower enzyme activity, lower plasma folate, and elevated
plasma homocysteine (19,20). In addition, homozygosity is
associated with a change in the proﬁle of RBC folates, with an
increased proportion being in the formyl tetrahydrofolate poly-
glutamate form (21). The activity of MTHFR seems therefore
to be a determinant of the availability of folate for DNA
synthesis or methylation. Riboﬂavin, as FAD, is a cofactor for
MTHFR, and there is evidently some interaction between
riboﬂavin status, folate status, and genotype in determining
plasma homocysteine, a functional marker of folate status
(22,23,24). A study of the MTHFR expressed in Escherichia coli
suggests that the TT variant of the enzyme may be less tightly
bound to its FAD cofactor, whereas 5-methyl tetrahydrofolate
may to some extent protect the enzyme against this effect (25).
Polymorphisms in the MTHFR gene may modulate effects
of folate on susceptibility to cancer risk at certain sites, al-
though there is a great deal of uncertainty in this area. Inter-
estingly, polymorphisms in MTHFR may interact with folate
status to inﬂuence genomic methylation. A recent study by
Friso et al. (26) reports that subjects with low folate status and
carrying the TT variant of the MTHFR C677T polymorphism
had relative hypomethylation of DNA extracted from whole
blood compared with homozygous wild types, an effect that
was mitigated by high folate status. Other studies also observed
DNA hypomethylation in association with the C-to-T poly-
morphism in MTHFR (27,28). Furthermore, increased leuko-
cyte global DNA methylation in response to folate supplemen-
tation may be modulated by homozygosity for the C677T
MTHFR polymorphism (29). However, not all groups report
an effect of MTHFR polymorphism on DNA methylation
(30), and these inconsistencies may be related to the folate
status and the frequency of the TT variant in the study
population.

Folate, riboﬂavin, genotype, and colorectal cancer

Evidence from human studies for a role for folate in deter-
mining cancer risk is equivocal. Much of the work in this area
has concerned colorectal cancer, for which there is evidence
from epidemiological studies for a protective role for folate. A
number of case-control studies have demonstrated an inverse
association between folate intake and risk of colorectal cancer
(31–33), with an average reduction of about 30% for the
highest versus the lowest folate intakes. Interestingly, alcohol
intake may mitigate protective effects of folate (34). Results of
studies examining associations between biochemical measures
of folate status and risk of colorectal adenoma or cancer are
inconsistent. Perhaps of particular relevance is the observation
that folate concentration in the healthy mucosa of patients
with colorectal adenoma was lower than in control subjects
even though circulating folate concentrations did not differ
between these two groups (35). However, others reported no
difference in folate concentration in colonocytes from normal
tissue between patients with colorectal adenoma and healthy
controls (36). It would be helpful to establish whether folate
concentrations in colonic mucosa are sensitive to changes in
folate intakes.

Very few folate intervention trials have been carried out,
and those that have been reported have been small studies
focusing on patient groups with increased risk of colorectal
cancer. Furthermore, outcomes of interest have in almost all
cases been intermediate disease endpoints, such as DNA
methylation, mucosal cell proliferation, or DNA strand break-

colon. Other studies have reported that folate deﬁciency in
rats does not induce global hypomethylation or hypomethyla-
tion of c-myc in liver or colonic TP53 (5,6). Notably, some
evidence has emerged to suggest that folate deﬁciency may
induce hypomethylation only at speciﬁc sites on cancer-rele-
vant genes (1). Evidence is also emerging that folate deﬁciency
may lead to hypermethylation of sites within the promoter
regions for certain tumor suppressor genes, leading to gene
silencing (7,8). Conversely, increasing folate intake can inﬂu-
ence DNA methylation under certain circumstances. A recent
study among patients with colorectal adenoma demonstrated
that a supplement of 400 ␮g folic acid for 10 wk elicited a
signiﬁcant increase in global DNA methylation in leukocytes
and a nonsigniﬁcant increase in colonic mucosa (9).

Folate has a role in nucleotide synthesis, and folate deﬁ-
ciency increases incorporation of uracil into DNA in place of
thymine, which has been demonstrated in various models of
folate deﬁciency in vitro. Increased uracil incorporation into
DNA was reported in Chinese hamster ovary cells, lymphoid
HL60 cells, and human lymphocytes grown in a folate-deﬁ-
cient medium (10 –12). Folate-deﬁcient rats show increased
uracil incorporation into lymphocyte DNA (13), accompanied
by increased DNA strand breakage. Rats fed methyl-deﬁcient
diets also show elevated uracil incorporation into hepatic
DNA (14), although such effects cannot be ascribed solely to
a lack of folate. Interestingly, a highly conserved region of the
tumor-suppressor gene TP53 (exons 5– 8) appears to be par-
ticularly sensitive to folate depletion in rats, showing strand
breaks in colon and liver DNA (15,16). Evidence for effects of
folate depletion on genomic stability in humans is scarce, but
subjects with folate-dependent megaloblastic anemia show an
increased incorporation of uracil into bone marrow DNA,
which can be corrected by folic acid supplementation (17).
Uracil incorporation into lymphocyte DNA was also shown to
be responsive to 12 wk of 1.2 mg folic acid in healthy subjects
with normal folate status, although global methylation and
DNA strand breakage were unaffected (18).

Folate, riboﬂavin, and genotype

The role of folate in these processes may be modulated by
genotype for the common C677T thermolabile variant of
methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR). This enzyme
converts 5,10-methylene tetrahydrofolate to 5-methyl tetrahy-
drofolate, which is the methyl donor for the conversion of

age. Results are inconsistent. Biasco et al. (37) showed a
reduction in rectal cell proliferation in response to 3 mo of
folic acid supplementation in patients with ulcerative colitis,
whereas a study in Greece failed to show a signiﬁcant effect of
folic acid supplementation for 12 mo on adenoma recurrence
(38). On the other hand, Cravo et al. (39) showed an increase
in rectal mucosa DNA methylation after high-dose folic acid
treatment for 6 mo. Clearly, additional folate intervention
trials in humans are needed, and the results of 3 large-scale
intervention trials in the United States are eagerly awaited.
However, in view of the complexity and expense of such trials,
there remains an interest in the development of biomarkers of
cancer risk that are both responsive to exposure to the nutrient
of interest while also reﬂecting cancer risk.

In light of those studies suggesting a modulating effect of
MTHFR C677T genotype in determining functional folate
status, it is reasonable to consider the importance of this
polymorphism in determining cancer risk. In their 2004 review
of this subject, Sharp and Little (40) showed that the majority
of studies suggest a protective role for this polymorphism. A
further complicating factor that should be factored into new
studies is the possible role of riboﬂavin. Although FAD acts as
a cofactor for MTHFR and riboﬂavin intake inﬂuences func-
tional folate status, few studies have examined the possible
contribution that riboﬂavin might make to protection against
cancer. Of interest therefore are results from 2 case-control
studies that suggest a protective effect of an interaction be-
tween riboﬂavin and the TT variant of MTHFR C677T to
reduce the risk of colorectal cancer (41,42) (Fig. 2). These
observations are supported by data showing an interaction
between riboﬂavin and folate and this polymorphism in the
MTHFR gene to determine genomic stability in cultured hu-
man lymphocytes (43).

Further suggestion of an interaction among folate, MTHFR
C677T, and riboﬂavin that may be relevant to cancer risk
comes from a randomized, placebo-controlled intervention
trial we recently conducted in volunteers with normal mucosa
and those with adenomatous polyps. Subjects in both groups
were randomly assigned to a 50-d intervention of placebo, 400
␮g folic acid (low folate), 400 ␮g folic acid with 5 mg ribo-
ﬂavin (low folate plus riboﬂavin), or 1.2 mg folic acid (high
folate). Subjects were stratiﬁed according to genotype for the
C677T polymorphism. Of interest in the present context was
the fact that the riboﬂavin supplement enhanced the systemic
response to low-dose folic acid in polyp patients with at least
1 T allele (Fig. 3), which may reﬂect a mitigating action of
additional ﬂavins on the lower activity of the thermolabile
variant. Furthermore, the high-folate supplement elicited a

modest but signiﬁcant reduction in riboﬂavin status compared

reported before (24) and that deserves further investigation.

Folate, riboﬂavin, and cervical cancer

Cervical cancer has the second-highest incidence of can-
cers in women, after breast cancer. The incidence is far higher
in developing countries than in developed countries, with
about 83% of cases occurring in developing countries. Recent
global statistics point to age-standardized incidence rates in
developed countries of ⬍14.5/100,000, compared with values
as high as 42.7/100,000 in developing countries (44). Cervical
lesions are classiﬁed according to the degree of cellular abnor-
mality. The lowest grade of abnormality is cervical intraepi-
thelial neoplasia 1 (CIN1), and CIN2 and CIN3 describe
progressive epithelial dysplasia leading to invasive cancer.
Preinvasive lesions have also been classiﬁed in terms of low-
grade and high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions. There
is a high rate of regression of early-stage dysplasia, reported
variously as being between 30 and 62%; regression rates fall
with increasing dysplasia.

The key factor in cervical cancer causation is infection with
human papillomavirus (HPV). There are ⬎100 strains of this
virus, ⬃40 of which can infect the genital tract. HPV strains
have been divided into those that are considered low risk and
those considered to be high risk for the development of cer-
vical cancer. Although there is not universal agreement on the
precise classiﬁcation of all HPV strains, a recent large inter-
national study listed 15 HPV types that should be considered
to fall in the high-risk category (45). HPV DNA is more
common in cervical cells of women with cervical cancer than
in healthy control subjects (46), and antibodies to high-risk
HPV proteins are more common in the serum of cervical
cancer patients. Epidemiological evidence shows convincingly
that HPV infection is a necessary cause of cervical cancer
(47). However, HPV infection is usually transient, and only a
small proportion of women who test positive for high-risk
HPV infection go on to develop cervical cancer. HPV infec-
tion may be necessary but is not sufﬁcient to cause cervical
cancer. Nutritional factors may affect the persistence of HPV
infection and thereby inﬂuence progression of early precan-
cerous lesions to invasive cancer.

Epidemiological studies support a role for diets rich in fruits
and vegetables as protecting against cervical cancer (48 –50).
Folates have been considered as plausible protective factors in

results. Some case-control

such diets, and a number of case-control studies, prospective
cohort studies, and small intervention trials were carried out to
examine this possibility. Nine case-control studies examined
the association between folate intake and preinvasive cervical
lesions or cervical cancer, but the results are not consistent. Of
these, 4 suggested a protective effect. VanEenwyk et al. (51),
who performed a hospital-based study, and Ziegler et al. (52),
who conducted a population-based study, suggested a nonsig-
niﬁcant protective effect. Liu et al. (53) and Kwasniewska et
al. (54) suggested a protective effect of higher folate intakes,
but in the other case-control studies a protective effect for
folate was not evident (55–59). Furthermore, only 4 (53,56 –
58) of the 9 studies corrected for HPV, which limits the
interpretation of
studies used
plasma folate as an exposure of interest, of which 2 studies
suggested a protective effect against cervical cancer, although
not signiﬁcant, whereas a third, which was hospital-based, did
not (60). Other case-control studies used RBC folate as an
exposure, which is a more robust indicator of long-term folate
status, and these generally supported a protective effect of
folate against precancerous cervical
lesions (57,59,61– 63),
that by VanEenwyk et al. (64) signiﬁcantly so. In addition to
the use of folate in blood as an exposure to dietary sources of
this vitamin, some studies examined the relation between
plasma homocysteine and risk of cervical cancer or precancer-
ous lesions. The concentration of plasma homocysteine is
considered to be a functional marker of intracellular folate
availability (the two variables showing an inverse relation)
and may therefore be a more useful measure than circulating
concentrations of folate. Weinstein et al. (61) and Ziegler et
al. (65) were able to show a signiﬁcant increase in risk of
invasive cervical cancer for women with elevated plasma ho-
mocysteine in population-based case-control
studies, and
Thomson et al. (66) showed a similar effect for noninvasive
lesions. Despite some encouraging results from these case-
control studies, randomized controlled trials have not gener-
ated convincing evidence for a protective effect of folate. Four
randomized controlled trials were conducted (67–70), only
one of which demonstrated a protective effect of folic acid
supplements. However, these studies were generally small and,
notably, did not correct for HPV infection, so results need to
be interpreted cautiously.

Folate and HPV infection

The persistence of HPV infection is reported to be a key
factor determining risk of developing intraepithelial cervical
lesions and cervical cancer (71); therefore, interventions that
control viral proliferation should be important to cancer pre-
vention. A few groups examined whether speciﬁc nutrient
intake might inﬂuence this. Giuliano et al. (72) conducted a
nested case-control study of dietary intake and HPV persis-
tence over 12 mo in a large cohort of Brazilian women.
Unfortunately, a restricted FFQ was used to estimate dietary
intake, and the focus of interest was clearly on carotenoids,
although other nutrients were included in the ﬁnal analysis.
Increased intake of ␤-cryptoxanthin, lutein plus zeaxanthin,
and vitamin C were inversely associated with persistent HPV
infection. The authors suggested that carotenoids and vitamin
C might limit HPV infection through antioxidant activity,
which in other models modulated response to viral infection
(73). This is plausible because antioxidant activity was shown
to reduce HPV transcription in the cervical cell line HeLa
(74), and HPV-16 expression was shown to be modulated by
redox status in vitro (75). Interestingly, in the Giuliano study
average intakes of folates were only about 50% of the RDA

and of vitamin B-6 were only about 30% of the RDA, in
contrast to vitamin A intakes, which were generally adequate
with a reasonably wide range. This suggests that either the
FFQ used could not capture these nutrients adequately or that
this population did have low intakes of folate and vitamin B-6.
This is relevant because folate and vitamin B-6 are important
in the methylation cycle and may inﬂuence HPV persistence
through viral DNA methylation. Rosl et al. (76) demonstrated
that HPV-18 DNA methylation downregulated transcription.
Viral DNA methylation is evidently a determinant of viral
transcriptional activity and therefore of viral proliferation.
Riboﬂavin may modulate this effect through its cofactor role
for MTHFR. Sedjo et al. (77) examined the relation between
HPV persistence and nutrients involved in methylation, in-
cluding folate, vitamin B-12, vitamin B-6, and methionine. In
a large prospective cohort study, using a validated FFQ and
measurements of plasma concentrations of the nutrients of
interest, higher plasma vitamin B-12 was inversely associated
with HPV persistence over 9 mo. Notably, a recent prospec-
tive cohort study carried out over 24 mo showed a signiﬁcant
protective effect of plasma folate ⬎ 2.4 nmol on risk of
becoming high-risk HPV positive and of HPV persistence
(78). The effect was still evident after correcting for other
micronutrients. The relevance of folate to HPV persistence is
also evident from the elegant studies of Pillai et al. (79), in
which the expression of folate receptors in cervical cells de-
creased with increasing severity of cervical dysplasia. Expres-
sion of folate receptors correlates positively with heteroge-
neous
ribonucleoprotein, which can inhibit HVP-16
proliferation in vitro.

The inﬂuence of C677T MTHFR genotype

The inﬂuence of C677T MTHFR genotype on cervical
cancer risk is not at all clear. A few studies examined the
possible association between cervical cancer and genotype for
this mutation, but results are conﬂicting. Zoodsma et al. (80)
recently reported a study of genotype for C677T MTHFR in
CIN and cervical cancer patients and healthy control subjects.
They showed a reduction in risk of cervical cancer in women
who were heterozygous or homozygous for the C-to-T muta-
tion. In contrast, 2 other smaller studies suggested that
MTHFR C677T was a risk factor for CIN (81,82). Henao et al.
(83) also reported a protective effect of MTHFR C677T for
CIN2 and CIN3 in a population with adequate folate intake.
Gerhard et al. (84) failed to show an association between
MTHFR C677T and either cervical cancer or infection with
high-risk HPV, and this was also true for the study by Lam-
bropoulos et al. (85). Thus, although there may be an inter-
action between this common polymorphism in a folate me-
tabolizing gene and risk of cervical cancer, there is currently
no consensus of results.

In light of the studies previously conducted and, in partic-
ular, the lack of controlling for HPV infection and MTHFR
C677T genotype, we have initiated a placebo-controlled dou-
ble-blind intervention trial to explore the effects of folic acid
with riboﬂavin on the regression of early precancerous cervical
lesions. Follen et al. (86) published a frank commentary on
why most randomized phase II cervical cancer chemopreven-
tion trials are uninformative. Although the focus of this com-
mentary was not nutritional intervention, the points raised are
relevant. Brieﬂy, this group identiﬁed key factors to consider in
designing phase II trials of cervical cancer: the natural history
of cervical cancer (in terms of regression rates of neoplasia), an
important determinant of sample size; dose and duration of

intervention to elicit the desired response; and consistency in
classiﬁcation of disease status at entry and as outcome.

Women are currently being recruited to the intervention
trial on the basis of a colposcopy-directed biopsy diagnosis of
CIN1 and an oncogenic HPV infection, and C677T genotype
is determined for all volunteers. The patients are randomly
assigned to receive either 1.2 mg folic acid and 5 mg riboﬂavin
or placebo for 12 mo. At baseline and postintervention, sam-
ples of cervical cells are collected for the measurement of tissue
folate status and DNA stability; cervical swabs are collected to
provide cells for HPV testing and for the measurement of
gene-speciﬁc methylation; and blood samples are collected for
the measurement of systemic folate and riboﬂavin status and
for MTHFR genotyping. The primary outcome is biopsy con-
ﬁrmation of regression of CIN; secondary outcome measures
include markers of DNA stability (uracil misincorporation,
strand breakage) and gene-speciﬁc methylation.

Gene-speciﬁc methylation

Variation in promoter methylation for individual genes was
reported for cancers at different sites. There is a small litera-
ture describing methylation status of various genes in DNA
isolated from cervical cells. Narayan et al. (87) found gene
promoter hypermethylation in ⬎80% of cases of cervical can-
cer, with the 4 most frequently methylated genes being
CDH1, DAPK, RARB, and HIC1, with an increased hyper-
methylation in more advanced stages of cancer. Virmani et al.
(88) reported a similar increase in DNA methylation with
increasing severity of pathological change. Interestingly, there
was a different methylation pattern of different genes accord-
ing to pathology; thus, methylation of RARB and GSTP1
appeared to be an early event, in contrast with CDKN2A and
MGMT, which occurred later in the development of invasive
cervical cancer. Taken together, these and other studies in this
area (89,90) suggest that hypermethylation of certain tumor
suppressor genes may be related to the development of cervical
cancer. Work from Kang et al. (91) indicated that there may
be an interaction between polymorphisms in MTHFR and
CpG island methylation status of cancer-related genes. Spe-
ciﬁcally, subjects carrying one or more T allele for the MTHFR
C-to-T polymorphism showed a reduced level of aberrant
hypermethylation in the promoter region of methyl guanine
DNA methyl transferase, a DNA repair gene, suggesting a
protective effect of the C-to-T polymorphism. Further inves-
tigation is warranted to determine any role for folate in inﬂu-
encing the methylation status of key genes. A clearer under-
standing of hypermethylation of genes in cervical neoplasia
and cancer may help in the development of prognostic biomar-
kers and in the identiﬁcation of gene targets for treatment.

Conclusion

Epidemiological studies point to a protective effect of folate
against cancers, particularly those of epithelial origin, al-
though there is currently little support from intervention tri-
als. The MTHFR C7677T mutation appears to interact with
folate in determining cancer risk, and there may be further
interaction with riboﬂavin status. The effect of this mutation
on cancer risk may be site speciﬁc in that individuals carrying
the TT variant appear to be protected against colorectal can-
cer, but the situation with respect to cervical cancer is much
less clear at present. Evidence for a protective effect of folate
against cervical cancer is currently weak, but this may be
partly due to a failure to consider the role of HPV infection as

a key risk factor. Folate may modulate HPV persistence and
thereby inﬂuence cancer risk.

ABSTRACT Animal studies have, in general, been supportive of a protective effect of ﬁsh and ﬁsh (n-3) PUFA
against breast cancer risk; but the epidemiologic evidence of such a relationship is limited. Case-control and cohort
studies have rarely shown signiﬁcant associations. The association between total ﬁsh intake and the effect of fat
content and preparation method of the ﬁsh, in relation to the incidence rate ratios of breast cancer, were
investigated among postmenopausal women. We also investigated the effect of ﬁsh intake with respect to estrogen
receptor expression of breast cancer tumors. A total of 23,693 postmenopausal women from the prospective study
“Diet, Cancer and Health” were included in the study. During follow-up, 424 women were diagnosed with breast
cancer. The incidence rate ratio (IRR) and 95% CI per each additional 25 g of mean daily intake of ﬁsh were 1.13
(CI, 1.03–1.23). Analysis of fatty ﬁsh gave IRR of 1.11 (CI, 0.91–1.34), and the result for lean ﬁsh was 1.13 (CI,
0.99 –1.29). When ﬁsh intake was stratiﬁed into three types of preparation methods, the IRR for fried ﬁsh was 1.09
(CI, 0.95–1.25), for boiled ﬁsh 1.09 (CI, 0.85–1.42), and for processed ﬁsh 1.12 (CI, 0.93–1.34). The IRR per
additional 25 g of mean daily intake of ﬁsh was 1.14 (CI, 1.03–1.26) for estrogen receptor–positive (ER⫹) and 1.00
(CI, 0.81–1.24) for estrogen receptor–negative (ER⫺) breast cancer. In conclusion, this study showed that higher
intakes of ﬁsh were signiﬁcantly associated with higher incidence rates of breast cancer. The association was
present only for development of ER⫹ breast cancer.

KEY WORDS:

● breast neoplasms ● ﬁsh ● estrogen receptors ● cohort study

Fish is a major food group worldwide. It is a source of high
quality protein and contains all essential amino acids, while
contributing to the intake of fat-soluble vitamins such as A and
D, and trace elements such as selenium and iodine. In many
countries, health authorities advise the population to eat more
ﬁsh; the Danish population, for instance, is advised to eat 200–
300 g of ﬁsh per week (1). In addition, a high proportion of the
population takes supplements containing ﬁsh (n-3) PUFA.

Epidemiologic investigations studying how intake of ﬁsh and
ﬁsh PUFA inﬂuences the occurrence of cancer, however, have
not been conclusive. A report by the World Cancer Research
Fund in 1997 concluded that ﬁsh may be protective against
cancers of the colon, rectum, breast and ovary; but the evidence
was considered insufﬁcient (2). Long-chain (n-3) fatty acids, of
which ﬁsh oil is a rich source, have consistently been shown to
inhibit the growth of human breast cancer cells both in culture
and in explants in immunosuppressed mice (3); but the epidemi-
ological evidence of a protective effect comes mainly from eco-
logical studies of breast cancer incidence and mortality (4–7).
Most case-control and cohort studies have focused on ﬁsh intake
rather than the intake of ﬁsh PUFA. We identiﬁed 20 case-

control studies relating ﬁsh intake to breast cancer. Although the
majority of these showed no signiﬁcant relationship (8–23), three
showed a signiﬁcant reduction in the risk of breast cancer with
increasing ﬁsh intake (24–26); in the study of Hirose et al. (26),
this was the case only among postmenopausal women. One study
actually showed a signiﬁcant increase in risk with increasing ﬁsh
intake (27). A recent pooled analysis of eight cohort studies,
including 7379 women who were diagnosed with breast cancer
during up to 15 y of follow-up, found an incidence rate of 1.01 for
a 100 g/d increment in ﬁsh consumption (28). In a recent review
of the epidemiologic literature on intake of ﬁsh and marine fatty
acids and the risks of hormone-related cancers, the authors con-
cluded that although the development and progression of breast
cancer appears to be affected by processes in which eicosapentaenoic
acid (EPA)3 and docosahexaenoic acids (DHA) play important
roles, it remains unclear whether the consumption of ﬁsh con-
taining marine fatty acids can alter the risk of these cancers (29).
Given the clinical relevance of hormone receptors, there
has been interest in determining whether epidemiologic risk
factors for breast cancer differ by estrogen and progesterone

receptor status (30). Some studies have investigated dietary
risk factors and estrogen receptor (ER)-speciﬁc breast cancer
(31–36). One of these addressed the intake of ﬁsh and found
that, among postmenopausal women, a frequent (weekly) con-
sumption of ﬁsh was associated with an increased risk of ER⫹
tumors and a reduced risk of ER⫺ tumors (32).

The aim of this study was to investigate the association of
ﬁsh intake and breast cancer among postmenopausal women,
and to evaluate whether a possible association was inﬂuenced
by fat content or preparation method of the ﬁsh. Further, we
wanted to investigate possible effects of ﬁsh intake on ER-
speciﬁc breast cancer.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS

In the prospective study “Diet, Cancer and Health,” we invited all
individuals who lived in two selected geographical areas (greater Copen-
hagen and Aarhus) and who fulﬁlled the following criteria: age between
50 and 64 y; born in Denmark; and not registered with a cancer diagnosis
in the Danish Cancer Registry. A total of 29,875 women participated in
the study between December 1993 and May 1997. This corresponds to
37% of the women invited. The study “Diet, Cancer and Health” and
the substudy reported here were approved by the Regional Ethical
Committees on human studies in Copenhagen and Aarhus, and by the
Danish Data Protection Agency.

Dietary information. Dietary information was obtained from a
detailed, 192-item food frequency questionnaire (FFQ), which study
participants received by mail before a visit to one of the two study
clinics. A description of the development and validation of the
questionnaire was published previously (37,38). The FFQ was devel-
oped to obtain information on the subjects’ habitual diet during the
preceding year. Answers to questions on intake of different foods and
dishes were given in 12 different categories, ranging from never to 8
or more times a day. For foods that come in natural units, such as
slices of bread, cups or glasses of different beverages, and pieces of
fruit, participants were asked to average their daily intake of the
relevant unit. For other foods, such as mixed dishes, a sex-speciﬁc
portion size was calculated by using the results from a calibration
study (39). A mean daily intake of foods and nutrients was calculated
by multiplying the frequencies of intake by the portion size, using the
software program FoodCalc (40). A total of 24 of the 192 foods and
recipes in the FFQ covered intakes of different types of ﬁsh, and
questions were speciﬁed according to preparation method. A biomar-
ker study was carried out to validate the information on dietary intake
of fatty acids, including ﬁsh PUFA (41).

Background information and anthropometrical measurements.
During their visit, participants also completed a lifestyle question-
naire, including questions about reproductive factors, health status,
social factors and lifestyle habits. Both the FFQ and the lifestyle
questionnaire were processed during the visit by optical scanning, and
checked so that missing or unclear information could be clariﬁed with
the participant before she left the study clinic. A few missing values
were accepted in the lifestyle questionnaire, but not in the FFQ. From
the lifestyle questionnaire, we obtained information about school
education (short: ⱕ7 y, medium: 8 –10 y, or long: ⬎10 y), parity, age
at birth of ﬁrst child, history of benign breast tumor surgery (yes/no),
use of hormone replacement therapy (HRT; never, past, or current)
and duration of HRT. Furthermore, professional staff members at the
study clinics collected biological material and obtained anthropo-
metrical measurements including height and weight. The BMI was
calculated as weight (kg) per height squared (m2).

A total of 6076 women were excluded from the analysis because
they were later reported to have had a cancer diagnosis before
invitation or were premenopausal (had reported at least one men-
struation no ⬎ 12 mo before entry and no use of HRT); or because
they did not provide complete information on either the exposure
variables or the potential confounding variables. Furthermore, we
excluded 106 women including one case who never ate ﬁsh, both
because they comprised a selected group, which may differ in an
unknown way, and because this group by deﬁnition cannot contribute
any information on how the breast cancer incidence rate differs by

the different amounts of ﬁsh intake, by the fat content of the ﬁsh, or
by the preparation methods of the ﬁsh. Thus a total of 23,693 women
were included in this study, including 5229 women with a history of
oophorectomy, hysterectomy or both (Fig. 1).

Follow-up. Cohort members were identiﬁed by the personal,
10-digit identiﬁcation number, comprising date of birth and a four-
digit running number, which is allocated to every Danish citizen by
the Central Population Register.

All 23,693 cohort members were linked to the Central Population
Register for information on vital status and migration. Information on
cancer occurrence was obtained through record linkage to the Danish
Cancer Register (42), which collects information on all individuals
with cancer in Denmark. Linkage was performed by use of the
personal identiﬁcation number. Each cohort member was followed-up
for breast cancer occurrence from the date of entry (i.e., date of visit
to the study center) until the date of diagnosis of any cancer (except
for nonmelanoma skin cancer), the date of death, the date of emi-
gration or 31 December 2000, whichever came ﬁrst.

In addition to the general Danish Cancer Register, a register
exclusively concerning breast cancer has been established in Den-
mark. Information on ER status was obtained from The Danish Breast
Cancer Co-operative Group, which holds records on a range of details
(e.g., ER status) for ⬃90% of breast cancers diagnosed in Denmark
(43). Although several medical centers were involved, a standardized
immunohistological method was used. The cut-off level used to deﬁne
positive receptor status was 10% or more positive cells. Linkage to the

Danish Breast Cancer Co-operative Group register was performed by
use of the personal identiﬁcation number as well.

Statistical analyses. The analyses of the relation between the
exposure variables and breast cancer rates were based on the Cox
proportional hazard model (including time-dependent variables) us-
ing age as the time axis to ensure that the estimation procedure was
based on comparisons of individuals at the same age. The other time
variable, “time under study,” was included as a time-dependent vari-
able, modeled by a linear spline with a boundary at 1 y after entry into
the study cohort, to allow for a possible “healthy-participants” effect.
In analyses considering ER status, the two types of breast cancer
deﬁned by the receptor status were treated as competing causes of
failure, i.e., in separate analyses, in which breast cancers of the
opposite type were censored by the age at the time of cancer diag-
nosis. Breast cancers with unknown receptor status were censored at
the cancer diagnosis in both analyses. All models were adjusted for
baseline values of established risk factors for breast cancer, such as
parity (entered as two variables; the categorical variable parous/
nulliparous and the quantitative variable number of births); age at
ﬁrst birth; previous benign breast tumor surgery (yes/no); length of
school education (low, medium, high); use of HRT (never, former,
current); duration of HRT; BMI; and alcohol intake. Two-sided 95%
CI for the incidence rate ratio (IRR) were calculated based on Wald’s
test of the Cox regression parameter, i.e., on the log rate ratio scale.
The procedure PHREG in SAS (release 6.12; SAS Institute, Cary,
NC) on a Unix platform, was used for statistical analyses.

All quantitative variables were entered linearly in the Cox model.
This is biologically more reasonable than the step functions corre-
sponding to categorization; furthermore, it increases the power of the
analyses (44). The hypothesis of a linear association was evaluated
using a linear spline with three boundaries as covariates in the Cox
model (45). For the continuous variables, the three boundaries were
placed at the quartile cut points of ﬁsh intake among cases (see Table

2 for placement of boundaries). The linearity was evaluated graphi-
cally as well as by a numerical test using the likelihood ratio test
statistic to compare the model assuming linearity with the linear
spline model. We found no signiﬁcant departure from linearity.

In the analyses, ﬁsh intake was divided according to fat content
(lean ﬁsh with ⱕ8 g fat/100 g ﬁsh and fatty ﬁsh with ⬎8 g fat/100 g
ﬁsh) and preparation method [fried (8 different questions), boiled (5
different questions) and processed ﬁsh (11 different questions)]. Pro-
cessed ﬁsh was considered a separate group because this type of
preparation differs from the two others by including ﬁsh prepared by
other methods, e.g., pickling, salting and smoking. In the analysis
comparing intake of fatty and lean ﬁsh (Table 2), women with intake
of only one type were excluded. Total energy intake was evaluated in
all models, but did not inﬂuence the estimates, and thus was not
included in the ﬁnal model.

RESULTS

The median age at entry for the 23,693 postmenopausal
women included was 57 y (range, 50 – 65 y). The median
length of follow-up was 4.8 y (1st-99th percentiles: 1.1– 6.8),
during which time 424 cases of a primary breast cancer were
diagnosed. Information about ER status of the tumors was
obtained for 394 (93%) cases of breast cancer. Of these, 303
(77%) tumors were reported to be ER⫹ and 91 (23%) tumors
ER⫺. For the remaining 30 tumors, it was not possible to
determine ER status on 10 in situ tumors; the remaining 20
tumors could not be located in the register.

The ﬁsh intake varied between 11 and 86 g (5th and 95th
percentiles) for the total cohort with a higher intake of lean
ﬁsh than fat ﬁsh. Most of the ﬁsh were fried, fresh ﬁsh or

FISH INTAKE AND INCIDENCE OF BREAST CANCER

processed, but intake of boiled ﬁsh was relatively low (Table
1). The associations between confounding variables and the
breast cancer incidence were all in the expected directions.
That is, the incidence rates decreased with number of chil-
dren, but increased with increasing values of age at ﬁrst birth,
use of HRT, duration of HRT use, length of education, intake
of alcohol and history of benign breast tumor surgery.

Total ﬁsh intake was associated with a signiﬁcant increase
in the breast cancer incidence rate per 25 g daily intake [IRR
⫽ 1.13 (CI, 1.04 –1.22); Table 2]. Adjustment for established
risk factors did not change the result. To illustrate this rela-
tionship further, the total ﬁsh intake was divided according to
quartiles. When the upper quartile group was compared with
the lower quartile group, there was an increase of 47% in the
incidence rate of breast cancer. To explore whether the ele-
vated IRR was related to the fat content, we divided the ﬁsh
intake according to fat content. This resulted in IRR of 1.11
(CI, 0.91–1.34) for fatty ﬁsh and 1.13 (CI, 0.99 –1.29) for lean
ﬁsh, both per 25 g mean daily intake. Analyzing ﬁsh intake
according to the three different types of preparation method
gave almost identical IRR when adjusted for established risk
factors. These results indicate that high total ﬁsh intake rather
than fat content or preparation method is associated with an
increased incidence of breast cancer.

High total ﬁsh intake was associated with a signiﬁcantly
increased incidence rate of ER⫹ breast cancer with an IRR of
1.14 (CI, 1.03–1.25) per mean intake of 25g/d. For ER⫺ breast
cancer, no association was present, i.e., IRR ⫽ 1.01 (CI,
0.83–1.24). Adjustment for established risk factors did not
change the result (Table 3).

DISCUSSION

This prospective study found that higher intakes of ﬁsh
were associated with higher incidence rates of breast cancer.
The association was independent of fat content and prepara-

tion method of the ﬁsh. The incidence of ER⫹ tumors was
increased for higher intakes of ﬁsh, whereas no increase was
seen for ER⫺ tumors.

Our study has several strengths. The FFQ used in this study
had 24 speciﬁc questions on ﬁsh, making this study very
comprehensive on this relationship, and providing the possi-
bility of studying the speciﬁc associations with ﬁsh according
to fat content or preparation method. Our FFQ was validated
(38). Also, a biomarker study comparing fatty acid proﬁles in
adipose tissue biopsies with dietary intake was carried out and
showed correlations between the ﬁsh PUFA measured in the
adipose tissue and in the FFQ of 0.58 for EPA and 0.49 for
DHA (41). The correlations for these speciﬁc fatty acids were
higher compared with other types of fatty acids, and compa-
rable to results from other studies (46). Danish women have
the third highest mean intake of ﬁsh among European popu-
lations participating in the European Prospective Investigation
into Cancer and Nutrition study, and the second highest mean
intake of fatty ﬁsh (47). Together with a high interindividual
variation in ﬁsh intake, it provides a unique opportunity to
study the signiﬁcance of different types of ﬁsh, including fat
content and preparation methods.

Because the data were collected in a prospective design,
differential recall for cases is highly unlikely. Follow-up rate
was nearly complete (99.8%). Adjustment for known risk
factors changed the estimates only slightly; thus, it is not likely
that residual confounding from those factors affected the esti-
mates considerably.

To our knowledge, no prospective study has examined the
signiﬁcance of fat content in ﬁsh in relation to development of
breast cancer. If the protective effect of ﬁsh PUFA shown in
experimental models could be applied to humans, we would
expect a protective effect most pronounced for fatty ﬁsh,
which was not the case in our study. Another hypothesis is
that ﬁsh might be contaminated with substances present in the
environment, such as heavy metals and pesticides, which may
have estrogenic effects. Because these agents accumulate in fat
tissue, one would expect the elevated risk to be more pro-
nounced with higher intakes of fatty ﬁsh compared with lean
ﬁsh, which was not the case in our study. The inﬂuence of
pesticides on breast cancer risk was evaluated in a recent
review of human epidemiologic studies (48). Studies on the
organochlorine pesticides dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane
(DDT) and dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE) did not
ﬁnd that these pesticides predict breast cancer risk in Cauca-
sian Western women. For another persistent organochlorine
pesticide, dieldrin, a relationship was found in Danish but not
in American women, with a doubling of the breast cancer risk

3668

STRIPP ET AL.

for women in the highest quartile group compared with
women in the lowest quartile group (49,50). The concentra-
tions of dieldrin were comparable in the two studies.

There are considerable discrepancies between the results
from experimental studies and epidemiologic studies, with
experimental studies exclusively showing a preventive effect of
ﬁsh oil on the development and progression of breast cancer.
The epidemiologic literature has not shown similar results,
when excluding the ecologic studies. An explanation of this
discrepancy could be that the ﬁsh oils and fatty acids used in
experimental models differ from those eaten by humans, e.g.,
with regard to content of contaminating substances. If this is
true, there might be a true beneﬁcial effect of ﬁsh PUFA but
it might be obscured by opposite effects of other substances
found in the ﬁsh being eaten.

If the association between ﬁsh intake and breast cancer
incidence was caused by the fat content of the ﬁsh, then a
higher rate ratio per 25 g ﬁsh should be seen for the fat ﬁsh
types. Thus, the almost identical estimates for fat ﬁsh and lean
ﬁsh indicate that the associations may be caused by other
substances that are present in equal amounts in fat ﬁsh and
lean ﬁsh. Although a recent study (51) showed that associa-
tions with dietary fat in general may be underestimated be-
cause of imprecise measurement methods, this is not applica-
ble for
study because there is very little
measurement uncertainty on the type of ﬁsh.

the present

Cooking at high temperatures has been shown to form
carcinogenic substances such as heterocyclic amines (HA) in
both animal and in vitro studies; several studies have investi-
gated how preparation methods of meat and ﬁsh affect breast
cancer risk. A prospective study with extensive information on
preparation practices found an almost ﬁve times higher risk of
breast cancer among women who consumed overcooked meats
than among women who consumed rare- or medium-cooked
meats (52). Whether this result is applicable to ﬁsh is not
clear, but it has been hypothesized that the HA content might
be even higher in well-done ﬁsh than in other meats (53).
Only one study reported on the speciﬁc relationship of ﬁsh
preparation and breast cancer risk, ﬁnding an inverse relation
with the frequency of main meals containing ﬁsh in poached
form (54). In our study, we did not ﬁnd any association with
preparation method. Our questionnaire distinguished among
preparation methods by separate questions on fried, boiled and
processed ﬁsh, and also questions on the appearance of the
surface of prepared meat, including ﬁsh, at four different levels.
There were no differences between cases and the cohort in
answers to the questions on doneness; however, our questions
might have been too unspeciﬁc to explain the degree of
exposure to HA, and factors other than the exposure itself
might be of importance. The risk of breast cancer has been
evaluated according to differential sensitivity toward HA, due
to genetic variations; one study reported that exposure to HA
may be a risk factor only among women with the high acety-
lating N-acetyltransferase 2 polymorphism (55).

To our knowledge, only one epidemiologic study previously
examined the relationship between ﬁsh intake and breast
cancer risk according to ER status of the breast cancer tissue
(32). This case-control study had results similar to ours. The
present study found no association for ER⫺ tumors but with
wide conﬁdence limits leaving the possibilities of adverse or
protective effect of ﬁsh intake on ER⫺ tumors.

Because this is the ﬁrst prospective study analyzing the
association between dietary ﬁsh intake and ER status–speciﬁc
breast cancer, the results have to be interpreted with caution,
especially because the number of ER⫺ tumors was relatively
small. In a review on pesticides and breast cancer, it was noted

Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jn/article-abstract/133/11/3664/4817947
by University of Ottawa user
on 24 June 2018

that out of several studies investigating the relation of ER
status of breast tumors to body burdens of DDT or DDE, only
one found a relationship between receptor status and tissue
levels of DDE, showing that women with ER⫹ breast tumors
had substantially higher concentrations of DDE in breast ad-
ipose tissue than women with ER⫺ breast tumors; the other
studies found no relationship (56).

Because the estimated associations for fat ﬁsh and lean ﬁsh
are almost identical, even very narrow conﬁdence limits would
lead to the same conclusion; thus, lack of statistical power of
the study cannot explain the lack of difference between the
two associations. Similarly, the estimated incidence rate ratio
for ER⫺ tumors per 25 g average daily intake of ﬁsh was very
close to one, indicating that lack of statistical power in itself
cannot explain the null result.

The present study indicates that the observed association
between ﬁsh intake and incident breast cancer among post-
menopausal women cannot be ascribed to the fat content.
Furthermore, the adverse effect of ﬁsh intake was observed for
ER⫹ tumors only. Further studies are warranted to examine
which other substances in ﬁsh or other risk factors related to
ﬁsh intake may explain the observed association for ER⫹
tumors, and to evaluate a possible difference in the association
for ER⫹ breast cancer and ER⫺ breast cancer.

Cancer in Mice Independently of the PPAR␥ Ligand Rosiglitazone1

ABSTRACT Overexpression of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2/neu) characterizes a molecular
subtype of breast cancer associated with poor clinical outcome. Preventive strategies for HER-2/neu–positive
breast cancer, which is often estrogen and progesterone receptor negative, remain undeﬁned. Activators of
peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ␥ (PPAR␥), a nuclear hormone receptor also expressed in breast
cancer, hold potential as cancer prevention agents. PPAR␥ ligands include speciﬁc fatty acids and synthetic
compounds, such as the thiazolidinediones, which appear to inhibit cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. We
hypothesized that a thiazolidinedione, rosiglitazone, may serve as a chemopreventive agent for HER-2/neu-
associated mammary carcinogenesis, but that efﬁcacy may be inﬂuenced by dietary fat content. We studied the
effects of diets enriched with corn or ﬁsh oil (25% of energy) with and without rosiglitazone (12 g/kg) in a 2 ⫻ 2
factorial design on mammary tumorigenesis in murine mammary tumor virus (MMTV)-HER-2/neu transgenic mice.
Despite in vitro evidence of antiproliferative effects in an MMTV-HER-2/neu tumor cell line, rosiglitazone did not
affect mammary carcinogenesis in vivo. Interestingly, ﬁsh oil– based diets markedly suppressed breast tumor
incidence (57% of mice vs. 87% of corn oil–fed mice, P ⫽ 0.0001) as well as tumor multiplicity (P ⫽ 0.001) and
mammary gland dysplasia (P ⫽ 0.001). These ﬁndings demonstrate a potent preventive effect of (n-3) PUFA on
HER-2/neu–mediated mammary carcinogenesis, without interaction with a synthetic PPAR␥ activator. Further
studies focusing on the mechanisms by which (n-3) fatty acids suppress HER-2/neu signaling pathways involved
in the pathogenesis of breast cancer are warranted.

The role of dietary fat concentration and source in breast
carcinogenesis remains speculative. Evidence suggesting that
the type of dietary fat, such as the fatty acid proﬁle, may
inﬂuence breast cancer cell biology or mammary carcinogen-
esis was derived from in vitro and rodent studies, respectively.
In general, cell culture and animal studies point to the stim-
ulatory effect of linoleic acid (LA),3 an (n-6) PUFA, on tumor
cell growth in contrast to the inhibitory effects of (n-3) fatty
acids such as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapenta-
enoic acid (EPA) (1–3). In vitro experiments demonstrated
increased proliferation of breast cancer cells as well as normal
human mammary epithelial cells in the presence of LA (4,5).
Unlike the tumor-enhancing effects of diets containing ele-
vated amounts of LA, diets enriched with the (n-3) fatty acids
EPA and DHA suppress both tumor growth and metastasis in

(6 – 8).

One potential mediator of the effects of speciﬁc fatty acids
and fatty acid metabolites on mammary tumorigenesis is per-
oxisome proliferator-activated receptor ␥ (PPAR␥), a ligand-
activated transcription factor expressed in normal and malig-
nant mammary epithelial cells (9 –13). PPAR␥is a member of
the steroid nuclear hormone receptor superfamily, with several
putative natural ligands, including speciﬁc fatty acids and
eicosanoids, as well as synthetic activators (14 –16). Fatty acid
derivatives such as 15-deoxy-⌬12,14-prostaglandin J2 (15d-
PGJ2) and 13- and 9-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid were also
identiﬁed as PPAR␥ ligands (17,18). Furthermore, PPAR␥
plays a key role in adipocyte differentiation and fat metabolism
(19,20).

Much of what is known about PPAR␥ was derived from
studies with synthetic compounds that activate PPAR␥, such
as the thiazolidinediones, a widely used class of oral hypogly-
cemic drugs (21). Rosiglitazone (Avandia®, GlaxoSmithK-
line) and pioglitazone (Actos™, Takeda Chemical Industry)
are thiazolidinediones currently utilized for the treatment of
insulin-resistant diabetes mellitus. Several studies indicate
that activators of PPAR␥ such as 15d-PGJ2 and thiazo-
lidinediones inhibit the proliferation of breast cancer cells in

vitro, which appears to involve cell cycle arrest and sensitiza-
tion to apoptosis (22,23). Thiazolidinedione treatment also
inhibited human breast cancer xenograft growth in immuno-
suppressed mice (11) and impaired the in vitro development of
preinvasive mammary lesions in mouse mammary gland organ
cultures treated with the carcinogen 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]an-
thracene (24). Administration of a synthetic ligand for
PPAR␥, GW7845, signiﬁcantly inhibited nitrosomethylurea-
induced mammary cancer in rats (25). These studies suggest
that PPAR␥ligands, either synthetic or derived from fatty acid
metabolites, may inhibit breast tumor development and pro-
gression.

Unique patterns of genetic aberration appear to account for
heterogeneity in disease progression and response to therapy.
One such genetic alteration is the ampliﬁcation of the human
epidermal growth factor receptor 2, HER-2/neu, which occurs
in 15– 40% of breast cancers (26) and portends a poorer
prognosis (27). Because tumors overexpressing HER-2/neu are
often resistant to hormone therapy, novel strategies are re-
quired for optimally preventing as well as treating this aggres-
sive molecular subtype of breast cancer.

Accordingly, this study explored the effects of 2 potentially
interacting variables that could target PPAR␥-mediated sig-
naling pathways during HER-2/neu-mediated mammary carci-
nogenesis. Using a 2 ⫻ 2 factorial design, we examined the
interactions between dietary fatty acid content [diets enriched
with (n-6) PUFAs vs. (n-3) PUFAs] and a pharmacologic
PPAR␥ligand (presence or absence of rosiglitazone) on breast
carcinogenesis in mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV)-
HER-2/neu transgenic mice.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Mouse experimental procedure. Animal care and use were in
accord with institution guidelines and approved by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee of The Ohio State University.
Virgin female FVB/N-TgN(MMTVneu)202Mul transgenic mice (28)
were obtained from Jackson Laboratory and housed in groups of up to
5 in plastic shoebox cages with autoclaved bedding and ﬁltered air,
with 12 h of darkness daily and an ambient air temperature of 22
⫾ 2°C. Mice had free access to diet and water. Mice were individually
tagged and randomly distributed into 4 (n ⫽ 15 per group) diet/
treatment groups representing a balanced 2 ⫻ 2 factorial design (ﬁsh
oil vs. corn oil and drug vs. no drug). Mice in groups were balanced
for age at the time of initiation of experimental diets at 7– 8 wk of age.
Diets were replenished daily, with removal of uneaten pellets and
daily monitoring of food intake. The health of the mice was moni-
tored daily, and mice were weighed and inspected for palpable mam-
mary tumors 1–2 times/wk. Two perpendicular diameters were mea-
sured weekly once a tumor appeared. Mice were killed by cervical
dislocation when tumors reached 1.5–2.0 cm in greatest diameter or
at 15 mo of age. Mammary glands were harvested and ﬁxed in 10%
buffered formalin for parafﬁn-embedding. Tumor histopathology was
conﬁrmed by evaluation of hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained
sections.

H&E-stained sections of mammary glands were evaluated without
knowledge of diet groups for mammary gland proliferative lesions
based on the consensus report from the 1999 Annapolis meeting on
mammary gland pathology of genetically engineered mice (29). Mam-
mary gland atypical ductular hyperplasia was graded on a scale of
minimal, mild, mild-moderate, moderate, and marked, based on the
percentage of the mammary gland affected, the thickness of the
proliferating ductular epithelium, and cellular atypia (high nuclear to
cytoplasmic ratio, cytoplasmic basophilia, cytomegaly, karyomegaly,
and cellular and nuclear pleomorphism). One representative nontu-
mor-bearing gland was examined for each mouse evaluated.

Diets. AIN-93G-based diets (30) were prepared by Research
Diets, with either 24.75% of energy as corn oil or 22.50% of energy
as menhaden (ﬁsh) oil plus 2.25% of energy as corn oil, with or

without rosiglitazone maleate (Glaxo SmithKline) at 12 mg rosigli-
tazone/kg of diet. This concentration of rosiglitazone was utilized
previously in FVB/N mice to achieve ⬃3 mg/(kg 䡠 d) (31). The 25%
of energy as fat was selected for a diet of moderate fat content without
consequential imbalance in carbohydrate and protein content rela-
tive to nonpuriﬁed diets, with corn oil as a source of (n-6) PUFA and
ﬁsh oil as a source of (n-3) PUFA. To accommodate the modiﬁcation
of fat content of the AIN-93G diet from 16 to 25% of energy, the
carbohydrate content was decreased to 55% of energy; t-butylhydro-
quinone at 0.23 g/kg and vitamin E acetate (Sigma) at 17.4 mg/kg
were added for stabilization of the menhaden oil. The diets met the
recommended dietary linoleate requirements for mice of 0.68% of
energy, and mice were monitored for signs of essential fatty acid
deﬁciency (32). The menhaden oil diets contained 2.1% of energy as
LA, and the corn oil diets contained 14.9% of energy as LA. Diets
were handled under low light conditions and stored at ⫺20°C.

Cell culture. The NT5 cell line (kind gift of Dr. R. Todd Reilly,
Johns Hopkins University) was maintained in Iscove’s Modiﬁed Dul-

the numbers of tumors in treatment groups were made using the
nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test with pairwise comparisons using
Bonferroni adjustment. Time to the development of palpable lesions
was deﬁned as the period from the initiation of treatment [at 7– 8 wk
of age] to the development of palpable lesions. Univariate compari-
sons of time-dependent data were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier plots
with logrank tests. In a multivariate setting of drug, diet, and an
interaction term of drug ⫻ diet, time to detection of palpable tumor
was analyzed using Cox proportional hazards regression. The sample
size of 15 mice/treatment group was chosen to allow detection of
hazard ratios ⱖ 4 with a power of 0.80 and 2-sided ␣ of 0.05.
Differences were considered signiﬁcant at P ⬍ 0.05.

RESULTS

Antiproliferative effects of PPAR␥ligands on HER-2/neu
transgenic mammary tumor cells. The NT5 cell line was
derived from an FVB/N-TgN(MMTVneu)202Mul transgenic
mouse mammary tumor (34). NT5 cells expressed PPAR␥
protein (Fig. 1A). By immunostaining, PPAR␥expression was
also demonstrated in formalin-ﬁxed NT5 cells and MMTV-
HER-2/neu mouse mammary tumor specimens (data not
shown). Although hormones such as progesterone or dihy-
drotestosterone can stimulate the MMTV promoter (35),
HER-2/neu receptor expression and phosphorylation in NT5
cells were not signiﬁcantly altered by PPAR␥ligand treatment
(Fig. 1B, C). However, the PPAR␥ activator, rosiglitazone,
inhibited the proliferation of NT5 cells (Fig. 1D).

in each of the 4 groups tolerated the diets well, without

CO2. PPAR␥ ligands included rosiglitazone, ciglitazone, and 15d-
PGJ2 (Cayman Chemical, Alexis Biochemicals) in IMDM with 10%
charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum.

Immunoblotting. Total protein extraction, SDS-PAGE fraction-
ation, transfer, and hybridization procedures were performed as pre-
viously described (12). Immobilized proteins were probed using anti-
bodies speciﬁc for PPAR␥ (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), c-erb-2/
HER-2 (Upstate), phosphotyrosine (Cell Signaling Technology), and
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) (Chemicon).
Immunoprecipitation with antibody to c-erb-2/HER-2/neu (Upstate)
was performed as previously described (33).

Cell proliferation assays. Methylthiazoletetrazolium in vitro cell
proliferation assays (Promega) were performed according to manufac-
turer’s instructions (12), using varying concentrations of rosiglita-

evidence of toxicity or signs of essential fatty acid deﬁciency.
Neither dietary fat nor drug content signiﬁcantly altered food
consumption or weight gain (P ⬎ 0.05, data not shown). Mice
fed the drug-containing diets consumed ⬃1.2 mg rosiglitazone/
(kg 䡠 d).

Dietary ﬁsh oil inhibits mammary tumor incidence. Of
60 mice, 72% (43/60) developed palpable mammary tumors.
Five of the 17 mice without clinically detectable tumors were
euthanized due to illness, and necropsy revealed 2 uterine
tumors (ﬁsh oil, corn oil ⫹ drug), 1 lung tumor (ﬁsh oil), 1
anal tumor (ﬁsh oil ⫹ drug), and lymphoma (corn oil). These
extra-mammary tumors were histologically distinct from the
mammary tumors and not representative of metastases.

Compared with the corn oil diets, dietary ﬁsh oil increased
the latency time to mammary gland tumor development in the
HER-2/neu transgenic mice (logrank P ⫽ 0.0001) (Fig. 2A);
57% (17/30) of the mice fed ﬁsh oil diets and 87% (26/30) of
mice fed corn oil diets developed clinically overt mammary
tumors. Thus, relative to the corn oil-based diets, dietary ﬁsh
oil suppressed mammary tumorigenesis by 30% (P ⫽ 0.02).

Rosiglitazone did not affect mammary tumor incidence at
15 mo (logrank P ⫽ 0.22) (Fig. 2B). In the multivariate Cox
model, the drug ⫻ diet interaction term was not signiﬁcant (P
⫽ 0.50), whereas diet was signiﬁcant (P ⫽ 0.019) and drug
treatment was not (P ⫽ 0.053).

Dietary ﬁsh oil

inhibits mammary tumor multiplicity.
Tumor multiplicity differed between diet groups as well, with
more palpable mammary tumors per mouse developing in those
fed corn oil than in those fed ﬁsh oil (P ⫽ 0.001) (Table 1).

Dietary ﬁsh oil also suppressed the number of mammary
tumors as determined by gross identiﬁcation at necropsy, when
additional macroscopic tumors were detected (P ⬍ 0.001), and
by microscopic identiﬁcation of microtumor nodules ⱖ 0.5
mm in H&E stained sections of whole mammary glands (P
⬍ 0.001). Rosiglitazone did not affect tumor multiplicity by
palpation (P ⫽ 0.40), detection at necropsy (P ⫽ 0.40), or
enumeration of microscopic tumor nodules per gland (P
⫽ 1.0).

Fish oil consumption is associated with lower-grade mam-
mary gland histopathology.
Pathologic review of H&E
stained sections of mammary glands identiﬁed atypical ductal
hyperplasia in all cases (Fig. 3). Of the 58 mice with mammary
glands available for evaluation, the degree of mammary gland
dysplasia differed between the diet groups (P ⫽ 0.001). Mam-

mary glands with less pronounced atypical ductal hyperplasia
(i.e., minimal and mild) occurred more frequently in mice fed
ﬁsh oil, representing 73% (11/15) of ﬁsh oil and 87% (13/15)
of ﬁsh oil ⫹ drug groups compared with 62% (8/13) of corn oil
and 20% (3/15) of corn oil ⫹ drug groups. In order of decreas-
ing frequency, we observed atypia of a higher grade (i.e.,
mild-moderate, moderate, and marked) in 80% (12/15) of corn
oil ⫹ drug, 38% (5/13) of corn oil, 27% (4/15) of ﬁsh oil and
13% (2/15) of ﬁsh oil ⫹ drug-fed mice. The only instances of
marked atypia occurred in 2 mice consuming the corn oil ⫹
drug diet. The degree of atypical ductal hyperplasia in mam-
mary tissue was associated with dietary fat content (P ⫽ 0.001)
although not for drug (P ⫽ 0.22), with a signiﬁcant association
of corn oil– enriched diets with atypia of increasing severity.

DISCUSSION

This study demonstrated a marked effect of dietary fat
composition on HER-2/neu-mediated mammary tumorigene-
sis. Enriched with (n-3) PUFAs, the ﬁsh oil signiﬁcantly
suppressed mammary tumor development compared with the
corn oil– based diets. Despite prior reports of the preventive
beneﬁts of EPA, DHA, and ﬁsh oil in carcinogen-induced and
transplantable breast tumor development, to our knowledge,
this is the ﬁrst report of breast cancer prevention in a trans-
genic model of mammary tumorigenesis by solely modulating
dietary fat composition. Our data indicate a potent effect of
ﬁsh oil in prolonging tumor latency and reducing tumor mul-
tiplicity in HER-2/neu overexpression-positive, estrogen re-
ceptor–negative breast cancer. Most interestingly, the lack of
effect of rosiglitazone suggests that the inﬂuence of dietary
fatty acid composition may be independent of PPAR␥ activa-
tion.

The mechanisms by which the type of dietary fat inﬂuences
mammary carcinogenesis are likely complex, with effects at
various stages of this multistep process, as summarized in
recent reviews (36,37). PUFAs may modulate diverse biologic
processes, including lipid peroxidation, eicosanoid production,
growth factor receptor function at the cell membrane level,
and signal transduction pathways affecting cell proliferation
and survival (2,38,39). Whether (n-3) PUFAs speciﬁcally
target pathways critical to HER-2/neu-mediated signaling,
such as those of mitogen-activated protein kinase and phos-
phoinositide 3-kinase (40,41), merits further investigation as

well. Indeed, certain molecular, genetic subtypes of breast
cancer might exhibit greater susceptibility to the effects of
dietary fat content.

Despite the lack of main effects of a synthetic PPAR␥
ligand or interactions with dietary fat composition, the possi-
bility of a mediating role for PPAR␥ cannot be eliminated
completely. Perhaps additional studies are required with vari-
ous PPAR␥ ligands administered over a larger dose range. For
example, the inhibitory effects of rosiglitazone in vitro oc-
curred at doses higher than those likely attained under the
conditions of our dietary study. Importantly, although rosigli-
tazone did not affect HER-2/neu-mediated breast cancer, the
corn oil ⫹ rosiglitazone combination tended to induce greater
mammary gland atypia relative to corn oil alone (P ⫽ 0.051).
Our in vitro ﬁndings in MMTV-HER-2/neu breast cancer cells
did not indicate that this potential stimulatory effect resulted
from activation of the MMTV promoter by the PPAR␥ligand.
Rosiglitazone possibly elicits a differential response of gene
expression patterns at different doses or has nonlinear dose
effects. Results of in vitro studies indicated that low, rather
than high concentrations of PPAR␥ ligands could have such
differential effects (42,43). Certainly, further studies with the
drug given over a larger dose range and increased numbers of
mice to enhance statistical power would help resolve these
issues. Interestingly, paradoxical stimulation of colon tumori-
genesis by treatment with PPAR␥ ligands was observed in
some models of colon carcinogenesis (44,45). A recent study
also demonstrated that mammary-speciﬁc expression of acti-
vated PPAR␥ in transgenic MMTV-VpPPAR␥ mice stimu-
lates tumorigenesis in mammary tissue that is cancer prone
(i.e., MMTV-PyV transgenic mice expressing polyoma virus
middle T antigen in the mammary gland) but not in tissue
from mice with a normal background (46). These reports and
our own ﬁndings underscore the importance of additional
efforts in a variety of models of cancer to understand the
molecular, biochemical, and cellular context of PPAR␥ sig-
naling.

An in vitro study indicated that PPAR␥ ligands could
inhibit neuregulin-mediated activation of HER-2/neu in
MCF-7 breast cancer cells (47). However, we did not observe
alterations in HER-2/neu expression or phosphorylation in
NT5 cells with different PPAR␥activators. Whether this lack
of suppression relates to this speciﬁc model of HER-2/neu
overexpression, both in vitro and in vivo, requires further
evaluation. A recent report also suggested that HER-2/neu
overexpression in MCF-7 breast cancer cells upregulated
PPAR␥ expression while inhibiting PPAR␥ ligand activation
(48). Thus, additional studies are warranted to investigate the
inhibitory interactions between PPAR␥ and
possibility of
HER-2/neu signaling pathways.

Taken together, our data demonstrate the strong suppres-

addition of
rosiglitazone did not alter the main effects of the (n-3) and
(n-6) PUFAs, sources of putative natural ligands for PPAR␥.
Because HER-2/neu overexpression represents an important
subtype of human breast cancer with particular aggressiveness,
our ﬁndings of the protective beneﬁts of diets rich in (n-3)
fatty acids in experimental HER-2/neu–mediated breast carci-
nogenesis establish a foundation for future clinical studies.
Indeed, the role of (n-3) fatty acid intake in the etiology of
HER-2/neu positive breast cancer as well as in support of
established adjuvant therapy in women with HER-2/neu breast
cancer should be considered

Abstract
Background: Estrogen receptor-negative (ER−) breast cancer tends to have poorer prognosis than estrogen receptor-
positive breast cancer. A number of studies have examined the association between diet quality as measured by various
diet quality scores and the risk of ER− breast cancer.
Objective: This systematic review aimed to summarize existing evidence on this topic.
Methods: Medline and Embase searches were conducted until 2 April 2017 for cohort and case-control studies on diet
quality scores and ER− breast cancer.
Results: We included 6 prospective cohort studies and 1 case-control study on postmenopausal ER− breast cancer: 4
from Europe and 3 from the United States. There were 12 different diet quality scores: 2 versions of the Dietary Inflam-
matory Index, 4 versions of the Mediterranean diet score, the Healthy Eating Index, the Alternate Healthy Eating Index,
the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score, and 3 versions of low-carbohydrate diet scores that differen-
tiate between different sources of protein and fat. Of the 4 studies on Mediterranean diet scores, 3 showed a significant
inverse association with postmenopausal ER− breast cancer, whereas no consistent association was observed with the
other diet quality scores. Although most diet quality scores in this review share similar food components, most of the
non-Mediterranean diet scores were represented by only 1 study each, and the associations with postmenopausal ER−
breast cancer were mixed. All studies were adjusted for multiple covariates.
Conclusion: This systematic review shows mixed results for an association between a variety of diet quality scores
and postmenopausal ER− cancer. However, results from different versions of the Mediterranean diet scores are more
consistent and suggest an inverse relation with ER− breast cancer. J Nutr 2018;148:100–108.

Introduction
Breast cancer is one of the most commonly diagnosed can-
cers in women, with the American Cancer Society estimat-
ing 252,710 new cases of invasive breast cancer in 2017 and
∼40,610 deaths (1). About 20% of breast cancers diagnosed
in the United States are estrogen receptor-negative (ER−) (2).
Reproductive factors such as nulliparity and advanced age at

first birth were more strongly associated with estrogen receptor-
positive (ER+) than ER− tumors, whereas duration of lacta-
tion is more strongly associated with a lower risk for ER+ than
for ER− tumors (3). In addition, chemo prevention using ta-
moxifen was particularly effective for reducing the risk of ER+
but not ER− tumors (4). On the other hand, after diagnosis,
ER− tumors have been associated with a worse 5-to-10-y sur-
vival rate compared with ER+ breast cancer (5–7). In one study,
ER− patients had a 1.72-times higher risk of breast cancer–
specific mortality than ER+ patients after controlling for age at

diagnosis, race, grade of cancer, tumor size, lymph node status,
radiotherapy, and year of diagnosis (7). In another study, ER−
status was associated with ∼4 times the risk of developing first
distant metastasis, especially during the first 2 y after diagno-
sis, than that of women with ER+ tumors (8). There are also
fewer treatment options for ER− breast cancers than for ER+
tumors, because these cancers do not respond to the safer and
better-tolerated endocrine treatments (9). Tamoxifen, for exam-
ple, has been shown to have little or no effect on ER− breast
cancer recurrence or mortality (10). Postmastectomy radiother-
apy also fails to improve survival in ER− patients (11).
Given the poorer prognosis and challenges of treatment, pre-
vention of ER− breast cancer is of significant public health im-
portance. While nonmodifiable factors such as parity, age at first
birth, and other hormonal factors are strong predictors for ER+
breast cancer, they have weaker associations with ER− cancer
(12, 13). Therefore, lifestyle risk factors may have a compar-
atively greater influence in the ER− subtype and, therefore, a
potential opportunity for ER− breast cancer prevention. Previ-
ous studies found a significant association between diet quality
and the risk of ER− breast cancer, but not for ER+ breast can-
cer in postmenopausal women (14, 15). Similarly, Zhang et al.
(16) found that carotenoid intake was inversely associated with
ER− but not ER+ breast cancer.

Evaluating the whole diet offers the opportunity to capture
interaction among foods and nutrients. Systematic reviews have
examined the current literature on the association between di-
etary patterns that reflect existing eating habits and the risk of
breast cancers (17–20) and found a possible inverse association,
but ER status was not distinguished. Diet quality scores are con-
structed with predetermined intake criteria and used to evalu-
ate the healthfulness of food choices (15, 21). They are gener-
ally similar in several characteristics, such as emphasis of fruits
and vegetables and de-emphasis of red and processed meats.
The only systematic review and meta-analysis on diet quality
scores was on the Mediterranean diet, and no significant asso-
ciation was noted (22). However, estrogen receptor status was
not considered in the analysis. Because there is a fair amount
of similarities between different diet quality scores, we aim to
evaluate the literature on this method of assessing the healthful-
ness of the entire diet. The purpose of the current review is to
summarize the evidence from observational studies, specifically
cohort and case-control studies, on the association of diet qual-
ity as evaluated by preestablished diet quality scores on the risk
of ER− breast cancer. Because the incidence of postmenopausal
breast cancer is ∼5 times that of premenopausal cancer (23), this
systematic review focuses on data regarding postmenopausal
women.

Methods
This review is registered on the International Prospective Register of
Systematic Reviews (24) in 2016 (PROSPERO, registration number:
42016051570), and it followed PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) reporting guidelines for sys-
tematic reviews. A literature search in Medline and Embase was con-
ducted up to 2 April 2017, and data extraction was performed by 2
reviewers (MD and CM). Year of publication was not considered for
exclusion. This systematic review focuses on predetermined (or a priori)
diet quality scores instead of data-driven dietary patterns derived from
statistical methods such as principal component analysis. The compo-
nents of the predetermined scores are more consistent across studies and
not as highly dependent on population intake. Searches for diet quality
were conducted in the following areas: diet quality, dietary guideline,

diet index, Mediterranean, DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hyper-
tension), vegan, vegetarian, plant based, healthy eating, breast cancer
or tumor or neoplasm, estrogen receptor, postmenopausal, prospective
study, and case-control study. The full search string is listed in Supple-
mental Table 1. The language was restricted to English. Abstracts, gray
literature, and unpublished results or information were not included.
The reference lists of the studies included in this systematic review were
also screened for additional studies.

Study selection. The included studies were required to be ei-
ther prospective cohort or case-control designs and were examined
for an association between diet quality scores and the incidence of
postmenopausal breast cancer with an ER− tumor type. The publica-
tions also had to include a priori–determined diet quality indexes or
scores instead of any posteriori method of identifying dietary patterns,
such as cluster or factor or reduced rank regression analysis. A hierar-
chical approach was used to select studies based on title, abstract, and
full text. Selection was conducted independently by 2 reviewers (MD
and CM) and disagreement was resolved by consensus in consultation
with a third reviewer (TF).

Quality assessment. Each study selected from the original search
was graded using quality checklists developed based on findings from
a systematic review of the available scientific literature by the Scottish
Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) (25) (Supplemental Tables
2 and 3). SIGN develops evidence-based clinical practice guidelines for
the National Health Service in Scotland. Per SIGN guidelines, separate
and designated checklists were used for cohort and case-control studies.
Study grading was completed independently by 2 reviewers (MD and
CM), and inconsistencies in grading were resolved by consensus.

Data extraction. The following information was extracted from
each study: last name of the primary author, year of publication, coun-
try or region where the study was performed, the name of the cohort
study from which the sample was taken, follow-up period (date range
of data collection and duration of study), study size, participant char-
acteristics (sex, age, and number of cases), dietary assessment method
used, exposure variable (specific dietary score examined), characteris-
tics of the diet score, RRs and 95% CIs, and variables adjusted for in
the multivariate models of each study. Two reviewers (MD and CM) in-
dividually extracted data from each study and collaborated to organize
and synthesize the data.

Results
The PRISMA flow diagram (Figure 1) illustrates the search pro-
cess. The initial search yielded 1023 articles, and after removing
50 duplicates, 973 articles were identified for abstract screening.
There were 738 publications excluded based on titles or
abstracts. The selection process yielded 35 potentially relevant
full-text publications, of which 28 studies were excluded: 12 did
not mention any dietary score in the full text; 6 used factor anal-
ysis; 2 used reduced rank regression; 5 were abstracts with no
full texts available; and 1 was a systematic review. Two publi-
cations focused on mortality in breast cancer survivors and, as
a result, were excluded. In total, 7 studies were included in this
systematic review.

Among the 7 studies included, 1 population-based case-
control study was conducted in Germany (26); 3 prospective
cohort studies were conducted in the United States [Nurses’
Health Study (NHS) (14, 15) and Women’s Health Initiative co-
hort study (21)]; and the other 3 were conducted in European
countries [European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and
Nutrition Cohort (EPIC) study (27), Swedish Women’s Lifestyle
and Health cohort study (28), and Netherlands cohort study
(29)] (Table 1). All 7 studies included women with an age range

of 30–79 y (only postmenopausal breast cancer cases were in-
cluded in this review). All studies used an FFQ for dietary as-
sessment, with the number of items ranging from 80–176. In the
EPIC study, an additional food record was combined with the
FFQ to assess dietary intake. In the cohort studies, the follow-up
time ranged from 11 to 26 y. Regression models in each study
were controlled for multiple confounders, including energy in-
take, BMI, age, physical activity, and others. The characteristics
of each study are described in Table 1, and scoring criteria for
each diet quality scores are described in Supplemental Table 4.

Dietary inflammatory index. The Dietary Inflammatory In-
dex (DII) was developed to quantify the inflammatory poten-
tial of individual diets. The 2 studies that used the DII in this
review used 25 (26) and 32 foods (21) and nutrients. Dietary
components were assigned positive or negative points depend-
ing on the data in the literature indicating their inflammatory

potential, with a higher score indicating a more inflammatory

lating concentrations of acute-phase high-sensitivity C-reactive
protein and plasma IL-6, both indicators of systematic inflam-
matory response (26).

status, and a higher DII was associated with a higher risk

Diet quality and ER− breast cancer 105

only for ER−/PR−/human epidermal growth factor 2-positive
subtype (HR comparing extreme quintiles: 2.37; 95% CI: 1.08,
5.20).

The Healthy Eating Index and the Alternate Healthy Eat-
ing Index. The Healthy Eating Index (HEI) was developed by
using the USDA Food Guide Pyramid based on the 1995 Di-
etary Guideline for Americans (30). It contains 10 food groups
and nutrients, including fruits, vegetables, grains, milk, meat,
total fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, sodium, and diet variety.
For each component, the possible score ranges from 0 to 10,
based on the level of intake, with a possible total HEI score
of 0–100. The Alternate Healthy Eating Index (AHEI) was
adapted from the HEI, and it addresses quality within food
groups. The component was modified to fruits, vegetables with-
out potatoes, nuts and soy, white-to-red meat ratio, trans fat and
polyunsaturated fat and saturated fat ratio, cereal fiber, long-
term multivitamin use, and alcohol intake, with a score range
of 0–87.5 (15). In both indexes, a higher score represents a
healthier diet.
Only one study examined the association between the HEI
or the AHEI and ER− breast cancer risk. In the US NHS, with
71,058 women with ≤18 y of follow-up and 575 ER− cases, the
HEI showed no association with ER− tumors (15). On the other
hand, a higher AHEI score showed a significant trend for a lower
risk of ER− breast cancer (RR comparing extreme quintiles:
0.78, 95% CI: 0.59, 1.04; P-trend across 5 quintiles = 0.01).

Mediterranean diet. The original Mediterranean diet index
was developed for the Greek population. It contains 8 com-
ponents, including alcohol, vegetables, fruits, legumes, cereals,
monounsaturated-to-saturated fat ratio, and dairy and meat
products. A higher score reflects a closer resemblance to the
Mediterranean diet (31). Since then, several indexes have been
developed for different populations to reflect the Mediterranean
diet. The Alternate Mediterranean Diet (32) score was an
adaptation of the Mediterranean diet score proposed by Tri-
chopoulou et al. (31).
Four cohort studies evaluated the association between the
Mediterranean diet score and ER− breast cancer risk. All 4 stud-
ies used cutoff points specific to the study population to assign
points to their version of the Mediterranean diet score. Using
data from the EPIC (European Prospective Investigation into
Cancer and Nutrition) cohort with a mean follow-up of 11 y,
Buckland et al. (27) measured resemblance to Mediterranean
diet using the adapted relative Mediterranean diet (arMed),
which did not include alcoholic beverages. The authors catego-
rized their 16-point score into low, medium, and high groups.
The high arMed was associated with a lower risk of ER−/PR−
tumors than was the arMed (high compared with low: RR: 0.80;
95% CI: 0.65, 0.99; P-trend = 0.043). In a Swedish study with
≤16 y of follow-up, a 2-point increment of a 9-point Mediter-
ranean diet score showed no clear association with ER− can-
cer (28). In the Netherlands, an 8-point, Modified Mediter-
ranean Diet Reduced score observed a 40% decreased risk (HR:
0.60; 95% CI: 0.39, 0.93; P-trend across 5 quintiles = 0.03)
in ≤20.3 y of follow-up (29). The only study from the United
States used data from the NHS, with ≤18 y of follow-up (15).
A significant inverse trend for ER− tumors was observed with
a higher Alternate Mediterranean Diet index (RR comparing
extreme quintiles: 0.79; 95% CI: 0.60–1.03; P-trend across 5
quintiles = 0.03).
106 Du et al.

Other diet quality scores: DASH or low-carbohydrate diet
scores. The DASH diet is a healthy eating pattern originally
developed to reduce blood pressure (33). The diet emphasizes
the consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins, fruits,
and vegetables. An index based on population-specific intake
has been developed to reflect adherence to the DASH diet, which
consists of 8 components: fruits, vegetables, nuts and legumes,
low-fat dairy products, whole grains, sodium, sweetened bever-
ages, and red and processed meats (14). For each component,
the score ranges from 1 to 5, based on quintiles according to in-
dividual’s intake ranking and the score range of 8 to 40 points.
The low-carbohydrate diet (LCD) is a popular diet, and
indexes have been created to reflect variations in the diet
that emphasize animal or plant proteins (34). To com-
pute the LCD score, percentages of energy from carbo-
hydrate,
fat, and protein are divided into 11 categories
based on percentiles. The percentile rankings constitute the
points assigned for each macronutrient. For fat and pro-
tein, individuals in the highest category receive the highest,
9 points, and so forth. For carbohydrate, the lowest receives
10 points, and the highest receives 0 points. The overall score
is the summation of points from carbohydrate, fat, and protein
with a range of 0–30 points.
Only one study examined these scores and the risk of ER−
breast cancer in postmenopausal women. In the US NHS with
826 ER− cases, a significant inverse trend was observed with
the DASH diet score (quintile 5 compared with quintile 1—
RR: 0.80; 95% CI: 0.64, 1.01; P-trend = 0.02) (14). How-
ever, among the 3 versions of LCDs, only the vegetable LCD
score showed an inverse trend with ER− cancer risk (RR com-
paring extreme quintiles: 0.81; 95% CI: 0.65, 1.01; P-trend =
0.03), whereas no association was observed with the overall
LCD score or the animal LCD score.

Geographic difference. Overall, the European studies showed
mixed results, with the larger studies showing a significant in-
verse relation and the smaller studies finding no association.
Data from the United States came from only 2 cohorts, and
tended to report inverse associations between dietary quality
scores and risk of postmenopausal ER− cancer (14, 15, 21). For
the various Mediterranean diet scores, slightly more consistency
was observed, with 2 out of 3 European studies (27–29) and 1
US study (15) showing a significant inverse association.

Discussion
In this systematic review, we identified 6 prospective cohort
studies and 1 case-control study that examined the association
between diet quality scores and postmenopausal ER− breast
cancer risk. The studies were large, and the magnitude of associ-
ation comparing top to bottom score categories were moderate
to strong. The most consistent inverse association was observed
for variations of the Mediterranean diet score. Studies on the
other dietary quality scores were mostly from the United States,
and results were mixed. Even though these other dietary qual-
ity scores reflect the healthfulness of the diet, the direction of
associations was inconsistent.

The various versions of Mediterranean diet scores aimed
to examine the foods consumed in the traditional diet of the
area, which generally reflected a healthy diet. The different ver-
sions of the scores were remarkably similar in the food groups
included, although there was variability in the possible score
range. This likely contributed to better consistency in results

observed when compared with the other diet quality scores. A
recent meta-analysis that examined ER− tumors using 2 studies
showed an inverse association between the Mediterranean diet
score and ER− breast cancer (15, 29). The PREDIMED (PRE-
vención con DIeta MEDiterránea) trial examined the Mediter-
ranean diet with additional extra virgin olive oil, the Mediter-
ranean diet with additional mixed nuts, and a low-fat control
arm (35). All women were postmenopausal. In 5 y of follow-
up there were 35 incident breast cancer cases, but only 2 were
confirmed ER−; 31 were confirmed ER+ and the rest were un-
known. Breast cancer incidence was significantly lower in the
Mediterranean diet + extra virgin olive oil arm (HR: 0.62, P =
0.02) when compared with the controls. The Mediterranean diet
+ mixed nuts arm showed a possible lower risk (HR: 0.62, P =
0.24), although it was not statistically significant. These results
regarding the Mediterranean diet are promising, but translating
the findings into specific recommendations for the public would
require further confirmation and more-detailed specification of
intake quantities.

Diet quality scores other than those measuring the adher-
ence of the Mediterranean diet were constructed to measure
specific dietary attributes (e.g., LCD scores) or to reflect an
overall healthy diet (e.g., HEI and AHEI). Therefore, their
characteristics ranged from those that emphasized fruits and
vegetables while discouraging red and processed meats (e.g.,
HEI and DASH), to focusing on specific nutrients (e.g., LCDs).
In addition, the number of score components ranged from 8 in
the DASH (15) score to 32 in one of the DIIs (21). These varia-
tions likely contributed to the inconsistent results observed for
these other diet quality scores.

The studies included were high-quality observational stud-
ies. Each was controlled for multiple confounders, although
residual confounding cannot be completely avoided. The co-
hort studies had a minimum follow-up of 11 y, and the smallest
study had nearly 50,000 participants at the beginning of follow-
up. Therefore, there was a substantial amount of time for cases
to develop. Nevertheless, ER− tumors are not the predominant
type in breast cancer cases, and so there was some constraint
on statistical power. Dietary information was self-reported us-
ing validated FFQs. While some amount of inaccuracy in re-
porting cannot be avoided and the FFQ cannot precisely deter-
mine absolute intake, the FFQs used were validated and were
adequate in ranking individuals according to their level of in-
take (36). In all studies, ER− breast cancer cases were identified
or confirmed through cancer registries, or clinical or pathology
records.
A healthy diet may reduce the development of ER− breast
cancer through several mechanisms. The abundance of dietary
fiber, antioxidants, and vitamins may suppress inflammatory
responses, neutralize free radicals, and prevent DNA damage
(37, 38). The favorable association may also be mediated by
weight management because higher adiposity has been identi-
fied as a risk factor of breast cancer. In addition, the Mediter-
ranean diet has been shown to improve insulin resistance and
glycemic control (39), which are more strongly associated with
ER− than with ER+ breast cancer (40, 41).

Out of the 8 diet quality scores examined in the studies in-
cluded in this review, 6 showed a significant inverse associa-
tion with ER− breast cancer. In addition to the heterogeneity
of score construction, the mixed results might be due to rel-
evant diet components not captured by these scores, residual
confounding, or a true null association between the diet quality
scores investigated and risk of postmenopausal ER− breast can-
cer. Additional studies are needed to determine what healthy diet

characteristics are most strongly associated with a lower risk of
ER− breast cancer.

The primary limitation of this review is the few number of
studies for each diet score. Although there were 7 studies, none
of the diet scores was examined in >2 studies except for the
Mediterranean diet score, and the heterogeneity of score con-
struction made it difficult to compare the results across studies.
Whereas most studies included were cohort studies, one study
used a case-control study design. In addition, results were based
on different categorization of diet quality scores and reference
groups. The studies in this systematic review are observational
studies; therefore, causal relationships cannot be directly es-
tablished. There may also be some level of recall bias in the
case-control study included in this review because cases were
interviewed after cancer diagnosis.

In conclusion, this systematic review showed mixed results
for an association between a variety of diet quality scores and
postmenopausal ER− cancer. However, results from versions of
the Mediterranean diet scores were more consistent in suggest-
ing an inverse association.

Context Secondary analyses of 2 randomized controlled trials and supportive epi-
demiologic and preclinical data indicated the potential of selenium and vitamin E for
preventing prostate cancer.
Objective To determine whether selenium, vitamin E, or both could prevent pros-
tate cancer and other diseases with little or no toxicity in relatively healthy men.
Design, Setting, and Participants A randomized, placebo-controlled trial (Sele-
nium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial [SELECT]) of 35 533 men from 427 par-
ticipating sites in the United States, Canada, and Puerto Rico randomly assigned to 4
groups (selenium, vitamin E, selenium ⫹ vitamin E, and placebo) in a double-blind
fashion between August 22, 2001, and June 24, 2004. Baseline eligibility included age
50 years or older (African American men) or 55 years or older (all other men), a serum
prostate-specific antigen level of 4 ng/mL or less, and a digital rectal examination not
suspicious for prostate cancer.
Interventions Oral selenium (200 µg/d from L-selenomethionine) and matched vi-
tamin E placebo, vitamin E (400 IU/d of all rac-␣-tocopheryl acetate) and matched
selenium placebo, selenium ⫹ vitamin E, or placebo ⫹ placebo for a planned fol-
low-up of minimum of 7 years and a maximum of 12 years.
Main Outcome Measures Prostate cancer and prespecified secondary outcomes,
including lung, colorectal, and overall primary cancer.
Results As of October 23, 2008, median overall follow-up was 5.46 years (range,
4.17-7.33 years). Hazard ratios (99% confidence intervals [CIs]) for prostate cancer
were 1.13 (99% CI, 0.95-1.35; n=473) for vitamin E, 1.04 (99% CI, 0.87-1.24; n=432)
for selenium, and 1.05 (99% CI, 0.88-1.25; n=437) for selenium ⫹ vitamin E vs 1.00
(n=416) for placebo. There were no significant differences (all P⬎.15) in any other
prespecified cancer end points. There were statistically nonsignificant increased risks
of prostate cancer in the vitamin E group (P=.06) and type 2 diabetes mellitus in the
selenium group (relative risk, 1.07; 99% CI, 0.94-1.22; P=.16) but not in the sele-
nium ⫹ vitamin E group.
Conclusion Selenium or vitamin E, alone or in combination at the doses and formula-
tions used, did not prevent prostate cancer in this population of relatively healthy men.

of cancer death) estimated for 2008.1
An effective prevention strategy for
prostate cancer would have substan-
tial public health benefits, including the
potential to reduce the incidence of bio-
logically indolent prostate cancer,
which is significantly overdetected by
widespread screening with prostate-
specific antigen (PSA) and for which
most newly diagnosed men still un-
dergo curative-intent therapy involv-
ing substantial morbidity despite sur-
gical and other advances.2-6

Important secondary results of 2 ran-
domized controlled trials, the Nutri-
tional Prevention of Cancer (NPC)
study and the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-
Carotene Cancer Prevention (ATBC)
study, showed prostate cancer risk re-
ductions of 63% for selenized yeast and
32% for ␣-tocopherol (or vitamin E).7-10
In addition, a large-scale randomized
controlled trial11 involving several dif-
ferent regimens found that a combina-
tion of selenium, vitamin E, and beta
carotene reduced overall cancer mor-
tality. These clinical data, supported by
epidemiologic and preclinical data,12-19
led to the design of the Selenium and
Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial
(SELECT).20

Investigators in the United States and
Canada from major cooperative groups
of the National Cancer Institute and De-
partment of Veterans Affairs used the
Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial
(PCPT) accrual infrastructure (200
clinical sites, with 18 882 randomized
men) in designing and activating
SELECT. We report herein the effects
of selenium and vitamin E, alone or in
combination, on the risk of prostate
cancer and secondary end points in
SELECT.

METHODS
Study Design
SELECT is a phase 3 randomized, pla-
cebo-controlled trial of selenium (200
µg/d from L-selenomethionine), vita-
min E (400 IU/d of all rac-␣-tocoph-
eryl acetate), or both (planned fol-
low-up of minimum of 7 years and
maximum of 12 years) for prostate can-
cer prevention. The major eligibility re-

quirements included age 50 years or
older for African American men and 55
years or older for all other men, no prior
prostate cancer diagnosis, 4 ng/mL or
less of PSA in serum, and a digital rec-
tal examination (DRE) not suspicious
for cancer. No current use of antico-
agulant therapy other than 175 mg/d or
less of acetylsalicylic acid or 81 mg/d
or less of acetylsalicylic acid with clo-
pidogrel bisulfate, no history of hem-
orrhagic stroke, and normal blood pres-
sure were also required because of
antiplatelet effects of vitamin E and re-
lated findings of the ATBC study.

Participant characteristics were based
onself-report,includingself-identification
of race and ethnicity which were defined
by the US Census Bureau. Race and eth-
nicity data were collected mainly for the
generalizability of trial results. All poten-
tially eligible men were required to pro-
vide written informed consent before
being allowed to participate in the trial.
Thelocalinstitutionalreviewboardofeach
study site approved the study for activa-
tion and reviewed its progress annually.
The trial was activated in July 2001 and
follow-upblindedtothetrialresultsended
on October 23, 2008.

Baseline blood and toenail speci-
mens and a 5-year blood sample were
collected for future biological studies.
Prostate tissue samples collected dur-
ing the trial were submitted for confir-
mation by central pathology review (no
samples were collected at baseline). Par-
ticipants without prostate cancer had
clinic visits once every 6 months
throughout the trial; with prostate can-
cer, annually. Adherence and adverse
events were monitored every 6 months
and a limited physical examination in-
cluding assessments of blood pres-
sure, weight, and smoking status was
conducted annually. Prespecified ad-
verse events known to be associated
with vitamin E or selenium were graded
according to the National Cancer In-
stitute Common Toxicity Criteria.

Although eligible PSA and DRE re-
sults were required at study entry, an-
nual prostate cancer screening with PSA
and DRE was not mandatory because
the benefits of this screening were un-

der debate when the trial opened and
community screening standards were
expected to change during the trial. Par-
ticipants were recommended during an-
nual clinic visits to undergo a PSA test
and DRE according to the standard of
care at their study sites and the partici-
pant’s preferences. A formal preran-
domization period (28-90 days; no pla-
cebo run-in capsules) gave potential
participants time to decide if they would
agree to stop disallowed over-the-
counter supplements of selenium or vi-
tamin E throughout the study and to
demonstrate, by returning for random-
ization, their willingness to adhere to
the trial. Other adherence methods in-
cluded offering each participant a free
multivitamin containing no selenium
or vitamin E and assessing serum lev-
els of vitamin E and selenium in all par-
ticipants at a subset of study sites (22
sites representing 7.8% of the trial
population). These sites were chosen
a priori to be representative of the broad
range of sites in the trial.

End Point Assessment
Participants reported prostate cancers
to the study site staff. Study staff ob-
tained medical records supporting the
diagnosis and abstracted the diagnos-
tic method and clinical stage. Tissue and
the corresponding pathology report
were sent to the central pathology labo-
ratory for confirmation. Gleason Score
was based on central pathology review.
Men were asked at their first 6-month
clinic visit to report new events since
entering the trial and thereafter to re-
port new events since their last visit.
Cardiac-event data were collected in de-
tail from the trial beginning (2001); data
on diabetes were added through self-
reported glitazone medication use (be-
ginning in 2003) and self-report of dia-
betes (beginning in 2005) via the
following question at each clinic visit:
“Does the participant report having dia-
betes (either his doctor told him he has
diabetes or he is taking medication for
diabetes)?”

A general question regarding any
events considered severe or life-
threatening (grade 3 or 4), regardless

of attribution to the study supple-
ments, was also asked. A Social Secu-
rity Death Index search was con-
ducted in July 2008 for participants who
had a last contact date of more than 18
months before the search. Other spe-
cifically queried events (known at study
inception to be related to either of the
study supplements) included alope-
cia, dermatitis, fatigue, halitosis, nail
changes, and nausea.

Statistical Analysis
The primary end point was prostate can-
cer incidence as determined by routine
clinical management. Cancers that were
not confirmed centrally were included
in the analysis. SELECT was designed as
a 4 group trial with 5 prespecified com-
parisons (selenium vs placebo, vitamin
E vs placebo, selenium ⫹ vitamin E vs
placebo, selenium vs selenium ⫹ vita-
min E, and vitamin E vs selenium ⫹ vi-
tamin E). With a sample size of 32 400
men, using a 1-sided ␣=.005 level
(equivalent to a 2-sided ␣=.01 level),
there was 96% power to detect a 25% re-

duction in prostate cancer for either of
the single agents (vs placebo), 89% power
to detect a 25% reduction for selenium
⫹ vitamin E (vs an active single agent)
and more than 99% power to detect a
44% reduction of selenium ⫹ vitamin E
(vs placebo).

Design assumptions were based on
the PCPT, ATBC, and NPC trials.
The details of the statistical design
have been described elsewhere.20
Important elements included (1)
constant accrual over 5 years; (2)
prostate cancer incidence in the pla-
cebo group based on PCPT for the
first 3 years and the 1995 Puget
Sound SEER registry afterward; (3)
adherence to the study supplements,
which was assumed to decrease over
the course of the trial with a 5-year
rate of 68% and 12-year rate of 51%;
(4) a constant 10% drop-in rate,
defined as participants receiving pla-
cebo who are taking active supple-
mentation off-study; (5) loss to
follow-up of 0.5% per year; and (6)
deaths estimated from PCPT for

years 1 to 3 and from the 1995 US
standard rates of men aged 63 years
and all races for year 4 onward. The
sample size was calculated to be
32 400 men and the number of pros-
tate cancers expected in the placebo
group was 533 over 12 years. Under
the assumed conditions, the required
median time under observation was
estimated to be 8.8 years.

The primary analysis consisted of the
5 prespecified comparisons detailed
above. These comparisons allowed for
a meaningful analysis of the study re-
sults whether an interaction between vi-
tamin E and selenium occurred. Each
individual test was conducted at a
1-sided ␣=.005 level (equivalent to a
2-sided ␣=.01 level) using a Bonfer-
roni factor of 5 to preserve an overall
1-sided ␣=.0025 level (equivalent to a
2-sided ␣=.05 level).

An independent data and safety
monitoring committee met yearly and
reviewed data on safety, adherence, and
diagnosis of prostate cancer. In addi-
tion to the final analysis, interim analy-

ses were planned for years 5, 7, 9, 10,
and 11 after the first participant was
randomized; the percentages of the ex-
pected total number of prostate can-
cer events in the placebo group at each
interval were 14%, 35%, 61%, 74%, and
88%, respectively. Each interim analy-
sis resulted in recommendations that
could have included modifications to
the study, including termination of ac-
crual, modifications to data collec-
tion, or early reporting of results. Rec-
ommendations were made to the
steering committee, which made the fi-
nal decisions.

The interim analyses tested the null
hypothesis at a 1-sided ␣=.0005 level
(equivalent to a 2-sided ␣=.001 level)

using the Cox proportional hazards re-
gression model. In addition, the alter-
native hypothesis of a 25% reduction in
prostate cancer incidence was tested at
a 1-sided level of ␣=.0005 (equivalent to
a 2-sided ␣=.001 level) using an exten-
sion of the Cox proportional hazards re-
gression model that allows for testing a
relative risk (RR) not equal to 1. The pur-
pose of the second analysis was to al-
low for the study to stop if it was deter-
mined that the expected reduction in
prostate cancer would not be observed.
The frequencies of the number of car-
diovascular events and cases of diabe-
tes were tested with a ␹2 test. For car-
diovascular event and diabetes analyses,
we did not capture the report of the date

of the event, which thus was not incor-
porated into the analysis.

Participants were randomized in a
randomized block scheme, in which
the block was the study site. This
ensured a balance of the 4 interven-
tion groups within each study site. All
analyses were performed by using an
intention-to-treat analysis in which
men were classified according to the
group to which they were random-
ized. All men were followed up until
death or loss to follow-up. For cancer
end points, men were censored at the
time of their last follow-up or death.
The analysis did not incorporate
adjustments for baseline covariates.
Data were analyzed by using SAS ver-

Supplement Quality Control
and Quality Assurance
The Pharmacy Coordinating Center
received the study supplements for
bottling as finished capsules in
shipments containing lots of ac-
tive capsules along with the ap-
propriate matching placebo. As
required by current good manufac-
turing practice,21 each lot of capsules
was quarantined upon receipt until
testing was performed to ensure that
capsules labeled “active” by the

manufacturer contained the ap-
propriate active agent and that cap-
sules labeled as “placebo” did
not contain an active agent. In addi-
tion, each time the capsules were
bottled, production-run-verification
testing was performed to ensure that
bottles labeled as an active agent or
placebo contained the appropriate
material. To ensure that the quality
of the blind was maintained, cap-
sules received in each subsequent
lot were compared with the previous
lot and with matching capsules in
the current shipment for their char-
acteristics of weight, shape and size,

color and external marking, odor,
and comparability of contents of
opened capsules. Whether the par-
ticipant guessed or had an external
validation of whether he was getting
the active agent or placebo was not
assessed.

RESULTS
On September 15, 2008, the indepen-
dent data and safety monitoring com-
mittee met, reviewed data as of August
1, 2008, for the second formal interim
analysis, and recommended the discon-
tinuation of study supplements be-
cause the alternative hypothesis of no evi-

2001, and June 24, 2004. FIGURE 1
shows the SELECT randomization
scheme including participants who
were excluded from analyses; all 621
participants at 2 study sites were re-
moved from the analysis because of se-
vere problems that were detected early
on including poor data and partici-
pant management and regulatory is-
sues. These participants differed sub-
stantially from the rest of the SELECT
population in being from sites in the
south of the United States, 99% Afri-
can American, younger (median age 57
years), and of a lower education level
(67% had ⬍high school education), and
in having lower PSA levels (57% had
⬍1.0 ng/mL) and a higher prevalence
of current smokers (33%). An addi-
tional 9 participants were removed be-
cause they were found to have had pros-
tate cancer at randomization and 15
were removed because their informed
consent was never received. More men
were accrued (35 533 in 3 years) than
initially planned (32 400 in 5 years)
mainly because of a faster-than-
expected accrual rate and the admin-
istrative time it takes to close down
accrual.

The baseline characteristics of
SELECT participants by each of the 4
groups (placebo, vitamin E, selenium,
and selenium ⫹ vitamin E) are shown
in TABLE 1. All potentially important
risk factors were well balanced among
the groups. A total of 2.6% of SELECT
men were former PCPT men random-
ized to finasteride; during the trial,
4.8% of the non-PCPT participants
reported use of finasteride at 5 mg
(n=1602) or 1 mg (n=86).

The median overall follow-up was
5.46 years (range, 4.17-7.33 years). The
percentages of participants with a re-
cent last-contact date were more than
88% within 7 months and 92% within
13 months of the SELECT data analy-
sis. Loss to follow-up, defined as hav-
ing a last contact date of more than 24
months before analysis, involved 5.1%
of participants, which was higher than
had been estimated for the trial design
(3.5% at 7 years after trial activation).

Compared with placebo, there was a statistically nonsignificant increase in prostate cancer in the vitamin E
group (P=.06) and not in the selenium ⫹ vitamin E group (P=.52) or the selenium group (P=.62).

Adherence to both study agents as de-
termined by pill count was similar across
all study groups, and averaged 83% at
year 1 and 65% at year 5. Adherence to
at least 1 of the 2 agents was 87% at year
1 and 72% at year 5 (the design-
estimated adherence rates were 90% at
year 1 and 68% at year 5). Bioadher-
ence was measured in a subset of par-
ticipants by serum levels of selenium and
cholesterol-adjusted ␣-tocopherol and ␥-
tocopherol (which is suppressed by ␣-
tocopherol) and showed a good separa-
tion in agent serum levels between the
groups (TABLE 2). The drop-in rate was
assessed by a direct question to the par-
ticipants about taking either of the
supplements. Positive responses were
3.1% or less for vitamin E and 1.8% or
less for selenium in each year (below the
design drop-in estimate of 10%). Pros-
tate tissue samples were sent to the cen-
tral pathology laboratory for confirma-
tion in 86% of cases. The central
laboratory agreed with the clinical site’s
prostate cancer diagnosis in 99% of these
cases.

Prostate Cancer
There were no statistically significant dif-
ferences in the rates of prostate cancer
between the 4 groups (placebo, 416 cases
[5-year rate of 4.43%]; selenium, 432

cases [4.56%]; vitamin E, 473 cases
[4.93%]; selenium ⫹ vitamin E, 437
cases [4.56%]) (TABLE 3 and FIGURE 2).
Compared with placebo, the hazard ra-
tios (HRs) for prostate cancer were 1.13
(99% confidence interval [CI], 0.95-
1.35; 95% CI, 0.99-1.29; P=.06) in the
vitamin E-alone group, 1.05 (99% CI,
0.88-1.25; 95% CI, 0.91-1.20; P=.52)
in the selenium ⫹ vitamin E group, and
1.04 (99% CI, 0.87-1.24; 95% CI, 0.90-
1.18; P = .62) in the selenium-alone
group. The data and safety monitor-
ing committee had some concern over
the statistically nonsignificant in-

The majority of prostate cancers di-

and grade were similar across all groups
(Table 3). The percentage of patients
who had an annual PSA examination

nosed by biopsy, the triggers for which
(based on PSA and other factors) are
shown in Table 3 and were similar
across all groups. The number of pros-
tate cancers in the placebo cohort was
higher than what was estimated at study
inception. This was due to the faster
than expected accrual, the larger than
expected sample size, and higher base-
line PSA levels than anticipated.

Secondary Outcomes
There were no significant differences
(all P⬎.15) in any prespecified second-
ary cancer end points (FIGURE 3 and
TABLE 4). At 5 years, the cumulative

death rate in the placebo group was 38
deaths per 1000 participants (95% CI,
34 deaths per 1000 participants to 42
deaths per 1000 participants); the es-
timated rate at trial inception was 48
deaths per 1000 participants. The num-
bers of deaths from any cause were simi-
lar across the 4 groups (382 in pla-
cebo group, 358 in vitamin E group,
378 in selenium group, and 359 in se-
lenium ⫹ vitamin E group).

The study agents had no significant
effects on the overall incidence of car-
diovascular events (Table 4). A statis-
tically nonsignificant increase in type
2 diabetes mellitus (diagnosed after ran-

domization) occurred in the selenium-
alone group vs placebo group (n=724;
10.0%; 99% CI, 9.1%-11.0%; vs n=669;
9.3%; 99% CI, 8.5%-10.2%, respec-
tively; RR, 1.07; 99% CI, 0.94-1.22;
P=.16). The number (percentage) of
cases of diabetes mellitus was 700
(9.7%; 99% CI, 8.8%-10.6%) in the vi-
tamin E group and 660 (9.1%; 99% CI,
8.2%-10.0%) in the selenium ⫹ vita-
min E group (P values of these data
compared with placebo were 0.47 for
vitamin E and 0.61 for selenium ⫹ vi-
tamin E). Data on known, clinically less
significant adverse effects of the study

COMMENT
In SELECT, neither 200 µg of selenome-
thionine or 400 IU of synthetic DL ␣-
tocopherol,givenorallyaloneorcombined
for a median of 5.5 years had significant
effects on the primary or secondary end
points. A statistically nonsignificant in-
creased incidence of prostate cancer
(P=.06) was observed in the vitamin E
group but not in the selenium ⫹ vitamin
E group. The trial supplements were dis-

continued early (in year 7 of the overall
12-yearstudy)inaccordancewithaunani-
mous recommendation of the data and
safetymonitoringcommitteestatingthat,
based on the evidence to date from the
7-yearplannedinterimanalyses,therewas
no evidence of a benefit from either study
agent and no possibility of a benefit to
theplanneddegreewithadditionalfollow-
up.Sensitivityanalysessuggestedthatthe
prespecified 25% risk reduction was ex-
tremely unlikely to be reached for either
agent even with additional exposure.

The statistical assumptions made in
SELECT involving accrual rate, study
supplement adherence and drop-in
rates, prostate cancer incidence, death

rate, and loss to follow-up were largely
met and gave the trial significant power
to detect the estimated preventive ef-
fects. Furthermore, the large sample
size, inclusion of a substantial propor-
tion of non-white men, and equal dis-
tribution of known risk factors across
all trial groups make the conclusions
drawn from SELECT especially ro-
bust and generalizable.

Why were selenium and vitamin E in-
effective in preventing prostate cancer in
SELECT despite strong secondary evi-
dence suggesting efficacy?7,8 Consider-
ing selenium first, the secondary reduc-
tion in prostate cancer incidence in the
NPC study could have been subject to

limitations inherent in secondary analy-
ses, such as chance findings due to mul-
tiple testing, especially because the over-
all NPC sample size was relatively small
(1312 men and women vs 29 133 men
in the ATBC study). Second, the formu-
lation (high-selenium yeast) given in the
NPC trial may have been more active
than the l-selenomethionine given in
SELECT (both trials gave an equivalent
selenium dose). In designing SELECT,
we carefully evaluated the choice of l-
selenomethionine vs high-selenium yeast
(and other formulations),20 and our ra-
tionale for selecting l-selenomethio-
nine included the following consider-
ations: selenomethionine was the major
component of apparently active high-
selenium yeast; evidence indicated sub-
stantial batch-to-batch variations in spe-
cific organoselenium compounds in
samples of NPC yeast, making it un-
likely that we could duplicate the sele-
nium yeast formulation used in the NPC
study; potential genotoxicity of highly ac-
tive inorganic selenium compounds,
such as selenite, made them potentially
unsuitable for long-term prevention; low-
ering (vs selenomethionine) of overall
body selenium stores with selenite, which
is neither absorbed nor retained well;
practical and safety concerns over newer
selenium compounds, such as mono-
methylated forms (eg, lacking availabil-

ity, investigational new drug certifica-
tion, and clinical data); and in vitro data
indicating that selenomethionine was ef-
fective in suppressing malignant and not
normal prostate cells.15

Despite this careful rationale, it is im-
possible to know now whether sele-
nized yeast would have been more ac-
tive than l-selenomethionine was in
SELECT. Finally, the NPC trial was con-
ducted in men chosen for deficient lev-
els of selenium, finding that selenium was
most preventive in the men with the low-
est baseline selenium levels9; SELECT
men generally were replete in selenium
at baseline, with median serum sele-
nium levels of 135 ng/mL vs 113 ng/mL
in NPC. The NPC cutpoint for the low-
est 2 tertiles was 121.6 units; 78% of
SELECT men were above this level. The
NPC trial found a nonsignificant in-
crease in overall cancer rate in its high-
est tertile (HR, 1.20; 95% CI, 0.77-1.86).22
There are potential reasons why vita-
min E did not prevent prostate cancer in
SELECT. First, the high dose (400 IU/d)
of the ␣-tocopherol form of vitamin E in
SELECT may have been less effective
than a lower dose such as the 8-fold lower
50 mg/d (roughly equivalent to 50 IU/d)
that produced the earlier positive sec-
ondary findings in the ATBC study.7 (The
vitamin E formulation, synthetic all rac-
␣-tocopheryl acetate, was the same in

SELECT and the ATBC study.) A sec-
ondary analysis of the HOPE trial23 found
that a relatively high dose of natural vi-
tamin E did not reduce prostate cancer
incidence. Achieving higher plasma or
tissue levels of ␣-tocopherol within the
physiological range, such as through a
50-mg/d supplement, may have some
prostate cancer (or other) preventive
effect such as cell proliferation or tu-
mor growth inhibition.24 Furthermore,
high pharmacological doses of ␣-
tocopherol may have an adverse effect on
cytochrome p450 enzyme and other
regulatory mechanisms25 that a lower
dose would not have. It is also possible
(but not certain) that the known effect
of ␣-tocopherol in suppressing poten-
tially beneficial plasma ␥-tocopherol lev-
els would have been less with the lower
than higher dose of ␣-tocopherol.20 Nev-
ertheless, men taking vitamin E with the
highest baseline (and thus total) serum
vitamin E levels in the ATBC study had
the highest reduction in prostate and
lung cancer,26 which supported our
choice of the higher dose. A higher dose
also was associated with potential ben-
efits such as reductions in aging-related
Alzheimer disease and macular degen-
eration.

Second, several studies have sug-
gested that vitamin E is more protective
against prostate cancer in smokers, and

rent or former smokers (whereas all men
in the ATBC study were smokers). For
example, observational analyses in a trial-
based cohort of the Prostate, Lung, Co-
lorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening
Trial (PLCO),27 a trial of screening vs
standard health care routines, showed a
71% reduction in the incidence of ad-
vanced prostate cancer associated with
supplemental vitamin E use in current
and recent smokers. A subgroup analy-
sis of current and former smokers in
SELECT, however, did not show a smok-
ing-related benefit (placebo, 4.6% [223/
4863] vs vitamin E alone, 4.8% [232/
4853]). As with selenium in the NPC
study, vitamin E effects on prostate can-
cer incidence in the ATBC study could
have been due to chance findings in sec-
ondary analyses.

Selenium was not associated with sig-
nificant effects on cardiovascular events,
lung cancer, other cancers, or overall
mortality in SELECT. One safety con-
cern with selenium is a potential asso-
ciation with increased risk for type 2
diabetes mellitus, for which there are
mixed data from prior studies.28,29 A re-
cent analysis of the NPC study popu-
lation showed a significant increase in
type 2 diabetes mellitus (by self-
report and medical records), largely lim-
ited to the top tertile of plasma sele-
nium levels at baseline.30

In SELECT, a nonsignificant in-
crease in risk (RR, 1.07; P=.16) of dia-
betes mellitus compared with placebo
was observed in the selenium group but
not in the selenium ⫹ vitamin E group
(RR, 0.97; P=.62). Concerns about the
safety of vitamin E supplementation
arose during SELECT. One meta-
analysis31 found that vitamin E at doses
of at least 400 IU/d increased all-cause
mortality, and another study32 found evi-
dence that vitamin E supplementation,
alone or in combination with other an-
tioxidants, may increase mortality. Nei-
ther study is directly relevant to the doses
and population studied in SELECT;
many studies included in these meta-
analyses were in patients with serious dis-
ease, and the finding of increased mor-
tality was driven by studies using doses

SELENIUM AND VITAMIN E FOR CANCER PREVENTION

far higher than 400 IU/d. In more rel-
evant, placebo-controlled trials com-
pleted in healthy men and women, there
were no associations of vitamin E supple-
mentation with increased risks of either
cardiovascular disease or overall mor-
tality.33 SELECT results support the
safety of vitamin E at 400 IU/d in healthy
men, because there were no increases in
either cardiovascular disease or total mor-
tality in the vitamin E groups.

The 35 533 randomized men of
SELECT were needed because of the ro-
bust statistical design accommodating 4
study groups with 5 primary compari-
sons; this large trial population made
SELECT the largest cancer chemopre-
vention trial ever conducted to our
knowledge. African American men have
among the highest prostate cancer risks
in the world, and SELECT had the high-
est participation of African American
men (13%) of any large-scale cancer che-
moprevention trial to date.

The statistical rigor of the trial was
matched by the rigor of its implementa-
tion. Features of this implementation in-
cluded the SELECT Workbench, a se-
cure Web site administered by the
SELECT statistical center and used by
study-site staff and investigators. The
SELECT Workbench was used to ac-
cess participant and site-specific re-
ports, the study protocol, and a detailed
study manual and to submit data using
Web-based forms. Form submission in-
cluded detailed edit checks and a track-
ing system to identify all expected forms.
Training and monitoring consisted of
semi-annual workshops, quality assur-
ance audits at least once every 3 years,
and mentoring by trained statistical cen-
ter staff and experienced clinical re-
search associates. SELECT also main-
tained a public Web site initially designed
to recruit participants and later used to
promote participant adherence and to
keep SELECT in the public’s eye.20

Potential limitations of SELECT in-
clude that it did not test different for-
mulations or doses of selenium and vi-
tamin E and that it did not definitively
assess results in subgroups of men who
may have responded differently than did
the overall population. Because of ac-

tive annual screening (eg, PSA in 85%;
Table 3) and early detection (eg, 99.4%
stage T1 or T2; Table 3), SELECT could
not assess effects in reducing advanced
or fatal prostate cancer, which recent data
suggest may be a potential benefit of vi-
tamin E and selenium.18,27,34-36 SELECT
also could not assess intervention ef-
fects in a population deficient in vita-
min E, selenium, or both since our trial
population was well-nourished at base-
line, or in current smokers since they rep-
resented only 7.5% of the SELECT popu-
lation, a substantial difference from the
ATBC study in predominantly heavy
smokers.

Cancer chemoprevention is an im-
portant approach for reducing cancer
burden.37 Several randomized con-
trolled trials have demonstrated sig-
nificant cancer or premalignancy risk
reductions in the breast, colon-
rectum, prostate, and stomach.38-44 Pros-
tate cancer is a particularly attractive
target for chemoprevention because of
its clinical ubiquity, substantial treat-
ment-associated morbidity, and step-
wise molecular pathogenesis. In the
large-scale PCPT, which was reported
2 years after SELECT was activated, fi-
nasteride produced a 25% relative re-
duction in the 7-year period preva-
lence of prostate cancer (vs placebo),43
and recent data suggest that finaste-
ride reduces the risk of clinically sig-
nificant disease and may not induce
high-grade cancers despite initial con-
cerns to the contrary.45-49

CONCLUSION
In conclusion, SELECT has definitively
demonstrated that selenium, vitamin E,
or selenium ⫹ vitamin E (at the tested
doses and formulations) did not pre-
vent prostate cancer in the generally
healthy, heterogeneous population of
men in SELECT. These data under-
score the prudence that is needed in con-
sidering recommendations to use agents
for the prevention or control of disease
in the absence of convincing clinical trial
results. These findings also compel the
medical research community to con-
tinue the search for new, effective agents
for prostate cancer prevention.

Abstract

Background: Lower levels of global DNA methylation in tissue and blood have been associated with increased cancer

risk. Conversely, cross-sectional analyses of healthier lifestyle patterns have been associated with higher levels of

global DNA methylation.

Objective: In this trial, we explored the associations between changes in lifestyle modiﬁcations (diet, weight loss),

metabolic markers, and global epigenetic biomarkers in white blood cells.

Methods: Study participants were Hispanic, African American, and Afro-Caribbean overweight and sedentary female breast
cancer survivors (n = 24) who participated in a larger randomized, crossover, pilot study of a 6-mo weight loss intervention and

who had available blood specimens. Anthropometric measures, a food-frequency questionnaire, and peripheral blood were

collected at baseline, 6 mo, and 12 mo. Plasma samples were analyzed for metabolic markers (insulin, glucose). We

measured DNA methylation of long interspersed nucleotide element 1 (LINE-1) and satellite 2 by pyrosequencing and

MethyLight, respectively, and global DNA methylation by the luminometric methylation assay (LUMA).
Results: DNA methylation of LINE-1 was statistically signiﬁcantly elevated at 6 mo [75.5% vs. 78.5% (P < 0.0001)] and 12 mo [75.5%
vs. 77.7% (P < 0.0001)], compared to baseline. Over a 12-mo period, changes in percentage body fat and plasma glucose concentrations
were positively associated with LINE-1 DNA methylation (b = 0.19, P = 0.001) and LUMA DNA methylation levels (b = 0.24, P = 0.02),
respectively. Similarly, 12-mo changes in dietary measures such as vegetable (b = 0.009, P = 0.048), protein (b = 0.04, P = 0.001), and
total caloric (b = 0.05, P = 0.01) intake were positively associated with changes in LUMA DNA methylation, as was intake of fruit
positively associated with changes in LINE-1 DNA methylation (b = 0.004, P = 0.02).

Conclusions: Our hypothesis-generating results suggest that lifestyle modiﬁcations may be associated with changes in

global DNA methylation detectable at 6 and 12 mo. These biomarkers may be useful intermediate biomarkers to use in future
intervention trials. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00811824. J Nutr 2015;145:783–90.

to have lower breast cancer survival than non-Hispanic whites,
possibly because of postdiagnosis lifestyle behaviors (1). Al-
though there is conﬂicting evidence, several studies have shown
that changes in dietary patterns and physical activity may improve
breast cancer survival (2–6). However, the biological mechanisms
through which changes in lifestyle behaviors may improve breast
cancer survival are not well understood.

Epigenetic modiﬁcations such as DNA methylation have been
proposed as a biological mechanism by which alterations of
lifestyle including diet and exercise can modify predisposition to
chronic disease (7, 8). DNA methylation involves the addition of

a methyl group at the 5# position of cytosine (5mC)9 in cytosine
guanine dinucleotides (CpGs). Global or genomic DNA meth-
ylation levels refer to DNA methylation levels throughout all
genomic CpG sites (9). Measures of global DNA methylation
biomarkers in peripheral tissue, such as blood, have been shown
to respond to environmental and dietary exposures. Studies have
shown that exposures to chemicals such as benzene, polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbons, persistent organic pollutants, and heavy
metals can affect DNA methylation proﬁles (10–16). Differ-
ences in health behaviors have also been related to differences
in global DNA methylation measures in a small number of
studies (9). Exercise and diet were both investigated in the North
Texas Healthy Heart Study, and increases in long interspersed
nucleotide element 1 (LINE-1) DNA methylation was associated
with higher fruit/vegetable intake and higher physical activity
(17, 18). Speciﬁc dietary changes, such as ﬁsh oil intake, have
been associated with the differential methylation of 27 speciﬁc
CpG sites in a study of the YupÕik Alaskan natives (19). Other
studies have found that increased physical activity during
childhood is associated with higher DNA methylation of
LINE-1; however, increased exercise frequency in the elderly
has been related to lower global methylation as measured by
the luminometric methylation assay (LUMA) (20, 21). Most
studies have found that current smoking is not related to
changes in global DNA methylation, whereas alcohol con-
sumption seems to be related to an increase in DNA methyl-
ation of CpG sites within CCGG sequences, but not in the
LINE-1 promoter region in some studies (11, 12, 18, 22–26).
Similarly, 2 studies found no associations when investigating
BMI and LINE-1 DNA methylation (11, 22), whereas another
study among women found that lower DNA methylation of
LINE-1 was correlated with increased BMI (27). Different
epigenetic biomarkers have yielded differing results when
measuring the effects of environmental exposures and health
behaviors, suggesting that several epigenetic markers should be
investigated when assessing changes because of these environ-
mental and behavioral factors.

In this study, we used anthropometric measures, health
behavior measures, and blood samples collected in a pilot study
of a dietary change and physical activity weight loss intervention
among overweight and sedentary minority breast cancer survivors
(28). We conducted hypothesis-generating analyses to assess the
associations between changes in anthropometric measures, met-
abolic biomarkers, diet, and physical activity with changes in 3
separate measures of DNA methylation that have previously been
associated with environmental and behavioral exposures: global
levels of DNA methylation measured by LUMA and levels of
DNA methylation at the repeated sequences LINE-1 and satellite
2 (Sat2). To our knowledge, this is one of the ﬁrst reports
examining changes in DNA methylation after a lifestyle modiﬁ-
cation intervention.

Methods

effects of a 6-mo weight loss program using physical activity and dietary
change. The study was targeted to Hispanic, African American, and Afro-
Caribbean cancer survivors who met the following eligibility criteria:
aged 21–70 y; diagnosis of stage 0–IIIa breast cancer; no evidence of
recurrent or metastatic disease; completed surgery, chemotherapy, and
radiation therapy at least 6 mo prior; BMI (in kg/m2) >25; sedentary
(deﬁned as physically active to the point of sweating <20 min/wk); not
actively engaged in a weight loss program; nonsmoker; hemoglobin A1c
<8%; blood pressure <140/90; and LDL cholesterol <150 mg/dL). Breast
cancer diagnosis and treatment and all clinical measures were conﬁrmed
by medical record review. Clinical data and blood samples were collected
at baseline, 6 mo, and 12 mo. The current analyses were restricted to the
subset of 24 women who provided buffy coat samples at baseline and 6
and/or 12 mo. For all variables presented in Table 1, we compared values
for women who did (n = 24) and did not (n = 18) provide buffy coat
samples. We found no statistically signiﬁcant differences other than in the
proportion of African American women (33% in subset with samples,
6% in subset without samples, P = 0.03). The Columbia University
Medical Center Institutional Review Board approved the study, and all
participants provided written informed consent in English or Spanish.

Anthropometric measures. Weight and height were measured at
baseline, 6 mo, and 12 mo with use of a calibrated electronic scale (FR
Instruments) and stadiometer (Accustat). Waist and hip circumferences
were measured by trained study staff using a Gulick II tape measure
(Country Technology). Body composition was measured by DXA with
use of the Hologic QDR 4500 densitometer (Hologic). Measurements
were available at baseline, 6 mo, and 12 mo for weight, waist and hip
circumference, and waist-to-hip ratio. Body composition was only
measured at baseline and 6 mo.

Physical activity, dietary, and weight
loss intervention. The
intervention has been described in detail elsewhere (28). Brieﬂy, the
6-mo weight loss program encouraged increasing physical activity to
90 min/wk, reducing caloric intake (1200 kcal/d for 1–2 wk, followed by
1600 kcal/d), and distributing caloric intake as 45% protein/30%
carbohydrates/25% fat. The following daily behaviors were emphasized
to promote adhering to a reduced-calorie diet: eat breakfast, eat 5 small
meals, eat $2 servings fruit, eat $3 servings vegetables, drink 2 L water,
read food labels when choosing foods, and pay attention to intake of
total calories, protein, fat, and carbohydrates.

Dietary assessment. Dietary intake at baseline, 6 mo, and 12 mo was
assessed with use of the Hispanic version of the Block FFQ, which
includes foods commonly consumed by African Americans (29).

Physical activity assessment. Physical activity was assessed with use
of a self-administered adaptation of the Kaiser Physical Activity Survey.
The survey provides global summary activity indexes for housework/
caregiving, active living habits, sports/exercise, and occupation (score:
1–5; 1: low activity, 5: high activity) (30). All 4 indexes were assessed at
baseline and sports/exercise was assessed at 6 and 12 mo.

Serum metabolic marker analyses. Serum samples were analyzed in
batches after all samples were collected. Glucose was measured via an
Integra 400 Plus automated chemistry analyzer (Roche Diagnostics).
RIA was used to measure insulin (Siemens). Insulin resistance was
calculated with use of HOMA-IR (31).

Study design and population. Analyses used data and blood samples
from breast cancer survivors who participated in the parent weight loss
intervention trial, which has been described elsewhere (28). Brieﬂy, a
group of 42 minority breast cancer survivors participated in a random-
ized, crossover, waitlist-controlled pilot and feasibility study to test the

analyzed at the completion of the study. Genomic DNA was extracted
from the total WBC fraction by a standard salting out procedure. Aliquots
of DNA (500 ng) were bisulﬁte-treated with the EZ DNA methylation kit
(Zymo Research) following the manufacturerÕs protocol. The DNA was
resuspended in 20-mL distilled water and stored at 220°C until use.

percentage of DNA methylation was expressed as:

ð1Þ

The interassay coefﬁcient of variation was 1.5%.

Pyrosequencing for LINE-1 methylation levels was performed with
use of PCR and sequencing primers as previously described (34).
Pyrosequencing was conducted with use of a PyroMark Q24 instrument
(Qiagen) with subsequent quantitation of methylation levels determined
with the PyroMark Q24 1.010 software. Three CpG sites were included in
the analysis. Each set of ampliﬁcations included bisulﬁte-converted
CpGenome universal methylated, unmethylated, and nontemplate con-
trols. The interassay coefﬁcient of variation was 0.67%.

The MethyLight assay was used to determine Sat2 methylation
levels. The MethyLight real-time PCR reactions were performed with use
of sequences of probes and forward and reverse primers of Sat2-M1, as
described by Weisenberger et al. (35). Universal methylated DNA served as
a methylated reference, and an Alu-based control reaction was used to
measure the concentrations of input DNA to normalize the signal for each
methylation reaction also described by Weisenberger et al. (35). Fully
methylated DNA to be used as the fully methylated reference sample, was
obtained by enzymatically methylating DNA extracted from human DNA
methyl transferases double knock-out (DKO) human cell line HCT116
DKO (Zymo Research). Each MethyLight reaction was performed in
duplicate, and the percent of methylated reference (PMR) values represent
the mean. The interassay coefﬁcient of variation was 1.2%. MethyLight
data for Sat2 was expressed as PMR values. The PMR is a relative
quantitative measure, and obtained percentages can be above 100%
considering the variable number of the consensus sequence used as control
and the number of repeats in individual samples.

Statistical analysis. Given the modest changes in health behaviors and
metabolic markers in both arms of the parent study (28), and the relatively
small number of women for whom baseline and follow-up buffy coat
samples were available (n = 24), participant data were analyzed as a cohort.
Paired t tests were performed to compare the baseline values to 6- and
12-mo values for anthropometric measures, health behaviors, metabolic
biomarkers, and DNA methylation measures. For each of the anthropo-
metric measures, health behaviors, and metabolic biomarkers, a generalized
estimated equation (GEE) model with repeated measures nested with
participants was used to examine the effect of its percent change on the
percent change of DNA methylation from baseline to 6 mo and 12 mo.
Each of the GEE models was adjusted by using the baseline value of the
predictor of interest and the randomization arm as covariates. We de-
termined that the randomization arm was a confounder between percent
change of some, but not all, of the predictors of interest and the percent
change of DNA methylation. Confounding was deﬁned as changing the b
estimate for the predictor by >10%. GEE model b estimates are based on
associations with a 1% change in the speciﬁed variable. To increase the
interpretability of results, in the results section we discuss changes in
anthropometric, metabolic biomarker, and dietary measures in terms of
10% changes in the speciﬁed variable. Statistical signiﬁcance was set at
P < 0.05. Analyses were conducted with use of SAS 9.2.

Global DNA methylation and lifestyle changes

785

52 y (range: 35–69 y) and 83% were postmenopausal. Partic-
ipants were 67% Hispanic and 33% African American. On
average, women were 3.4 y postdiagnosis (range: 1.2–9.4 y). Mean
BMI was 32.8 (range: 26.3–43.7). On average, reported caloric
intake was 1250 kcal/d, which is less than the recommended
1600 kcal/d intake for women over age 50 (36), and is likely an
underreporting given that all participants were overweight or
obese at baseline. On average, 38% of reported caloric intake
was derived from fat, which is higher than the recommended
<30% of intake from fat (37). Daily intake of vegetables averaged
1.4 servings/d (;70 g/serving), and, on average, participants
ate fruit 1.4 times/d, indicating that the combined intake of
vegetables and fruit was well below the recommended 5–9
daily servings (37).

Change in anthropometric measures, dietary intake, and
metabolic biomarkers. Mean changes in anthropometric
measures, dietary intake, and plasma metabolic biomarkers
from baseline to 6 and 12 mo have been reported elsewhere for
all study participants. In Table 2, we report results for this study
sample for objective measures including anthropometric and
metabolic markers and subjective measures including diet and
physical activity. During the course of this study, on average,
participants lost ;2% of their body weight from baseline to 6
and 12 mo (both P = 0.01; Table 2). There were corresponding
changes in waist, but not hip, circumference. At 6 mo, there was
a mean percentage loss in body fat of 2.4% (P = 0.03). At 12 mo,
we observed a 10.6% decrease in plasma insulin concentration
(P < 0.01) and an 11.4% decrease in insulin resistance as
assessed by HOMA-IR (P < 0.01). In addition, there was an
increase in the sports/exercise index at 6 and 12 mo (P < 0.001).

Change in DNA methylation biomarkers. DNA methylation
levels for each marker at baseline, 6 mo, and 12 mo are shown in
Table 2. Increases in percent methylation of the repetitive
element LINE-1 were observed from baseline to 6 and 12 mo
(4.2% and 3.0%, respectively; both P < 0.0001). There were no
statistically signiﬁcant differences observed in percent methyl-
ation measured by LUMA or percent methylation of the tandem
repeat Sat2.

Associations between changes in anthropometric mea-
sures, metabolic markers, diet, and physical activity and
changes in markers of DNA methylation. GEE models were
used to estimate the individual effects of changes in anthropo-
metric measures, metabolic biomarkers, diet, and physical
activity on measures of DNA methylation (Table 3). Weight
loss itself was not associated with changes in any of the global
DNA methylation markers. Of the objective measures, changes
in body fat and glucose were associated with changes in
methylation. A 10% decrease in body fat was associated with
a 1.9% (95% CI: 0.8%, 3.1%) decrease in DNA methylation of
the repetitive element LINE-1. We also observed an association
between a 10% increase in glucose with a 2.4% (95% CI: 0.4%,
4.4%) increase in global DNA methylation, as measured by
LUMA. No other associations were observed between changes
in anthropometric or metabolic markers and changes in other
epigenetic biomarkers.

Of the subjective diet and physical activity measures, only
changes in diet were associated with changes in LUMA and
LINE-1, and no other associations were observed. A decrease in
caloric intake of 10% was associated with a 0.48% (95% CI:
0.10%, 0.86%) decrease in DNA methylation. A 10% increase in
servings of vegetables and protein was associated with an

786 Delgado-Cruzata et al.

increase in LUMA DNA methylation of 0.85% (95% CI: 0.01%,
1.7%) and 0.41% (95% CI: 0.12%, 0.70%), respectively. A 10%
increase in the frequency of eating fruit was associated with an
increase in LINE-1 DNA methylation of 0.42% (95% CI: 0.06%,
0.77%).

Discussion

In this study, we evaluated 6- and 12-mo changes in global DNA
methylation in Hispanic, African American, and Afro-Caribbean
breast cancer survivors who were part of a larger study
examining the effects of a speciﬁc dietary change and physical
activity weight loss program among sedentary and overweight/
obese minority breast cancer survivors (28). A decrease in
percentage of body fat, an increase in plasma glucose concentra-
tions, and changes in diet were associated with changes in global
markers of DNA methylation. Although the magnitude of these
associations was small, these results are hypothesis generating
and suggest that changes in diet, body fat mass, and the
subsequent metabolic changes may affect epigenetic biomarkers.
Furthermore, results suggest that DNA methylation biomarkers
may be suitable intermediate biomarkers for lifestyle intervention
trials.

A decrease in global DNA methylation is associated with
increased genomic instability and chromosomal rearrangements
(38, 39), a common biological mechanism in several diseases
including cancer. DNA methylation is a mechanism to suppress
the expression of repetitive and viral DNA sequences that can
affect cell functioning (40). Reduced DNA methylation in WBCs
may be an indicator of systemic hypomethylation and of cumu-
lative environmental impacts. Conversely, an increase in DNA
methylation levels of repetitive elements may have a protective
effect against genomic instability and unwanted chromo-
somal rearrangements (41).

Our ﬁnding that LINE-1 DNA methylation levels increased at
the end of our intervention is supported by recently published
data of a statistically signiﬁcant increase in LINE-1 methylation
resulting from a dietary intervention (42). In the study by
Scoccianti et al. (42), all groups experienced a moderate increase
in LINE-1 DNA methylation levels after 4 wk. However, the
authors found no relation between LINE-1 DNA methylation
and speciﬁc diets, such as one with enriched ﬂavonoids and
isothiocyanates (particularly a cruciferous vegetable-based diet), or
one supplemented with ﬂavonoids (green tea and soy products). A
study by Zhang et al. (17) also found that a high fruit and vegetable
intake was associated with high DNA methylation of LINE-1 in
blood. In addition, higher LINE-1 DNA methylation was found in
individuals with higher exercise levels in the same population (18)
and in other studies (20, 21), suggesting an increase in LINE-1 DNA
methylation might be associated with healthy lifestyle habits. Future
studies are needed to conﬁrm these associations and to understand
the importance of the biological mechanisms at play.

Results of previous studies suggest changes in glucose
concentration can induce epigenetic changes. Increased LINE-1
and global DNA methylation have been associated with higher
glucose concentrations and HOMA insulin resistance, respec-
tively (43–45). In addition, chromatin modiﬁcations (46) and
altered DNA methylation at speciﬁc sequences such as the leptin
and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (CDKN2A) promoters
(47, 48) have also been shown to be related to changes in glucose
concentrations. A study that investigated DNA methyltransfer-
ase levels in a colon cancer cell line found that hypoglycemia
lead to a decrease in the concentrations of this enzyme, and
conversely, studies in mouse cells have shown higher DNA

methyltransferase activity and higher DNA methylation of
cytosines as a result of exposure to increased glucose concentra-
tions, proposing a biological mechanism through which decreases
in glucose can lead to a decrease in overall DNA methylation (48,
49). Our study adds to the growing evidence that suggests glucose
concentrations may result in increases in global DNA meth-
ylation levels; however, unlike previous studies, our ﬁndings were
restricted to measurements by LUMA and not DNA methylation
at repetitive sequences such as LINE-1. This might be due to the
fact that we observed only a small change in glucose concentra-
tions over our intervention period, which might not be enough to
trigger a change in LINE-1 DNA methylation levels. Previous
research investigated DNA methylation of LINE-1 and Alu re-
petitive elements (43–45). To our knowledge, our study is the ﬁrst
to explore a global measure of DNA methylation in association
with variations in glucose concentrations. Our current results
and the published evidence suggest glucose concentrations and
metabolism might play a role in epigenetic changes. However,
additional studies are needed to further explore this association.
In this study we assessed 3 different global epigenetic bio-
markers to investigate differential effects of our intervention on
blood DNA methylation levels. The epigenetic biomarkers used
here target different genomic sequences representing different
biological constructs that possibly respond differently to envi-
ronmental and behavioral changes. We measured global DNA
methylation by the LUMA assay, which targets CCGG se-
quences throughout the genome, and DNA methylation of the

repetitive element LINE-1 and tandem repeat Sat2. CCGG
sequences measured by LUMA account for ;7% of all CpG sites
on the genome and are used frequently as a surrogate measure of
global DNA methylation levels (50–53). However, because it
detects such a small fraction of the overall 5mC content, this
method may underestimate changes in 5mC levels, possibly
explaining why we did not observe an overall change in LUMA
levels at the different time points but detected an association
with individual dietary measures and glucose concentrations.
However, although data are available on the effect of vegetable-
based chemicals increasing DNA methylation markers such as
LINE-1 (42), no data to date support caloric intake changing
DNA methylation or epigenetic modiﬁcations. A previous study
highlighted the high number of promoter sequences covered by
LUMA (54). Therefore, LUMA might provide an indication of
changes in the regulation of expression of speciﬁc genes. The
estimates of the associations between changes in dietary factors
and LUMA measures are statistically signiﬁcant, but quite small,
which raises two additional concerns. First, although we took
precautions when performing laboratory measurements, we
might be observing an effect related to the technical variation of
the assay, which is higher than the observed change. Second, the
biological signiﬁcance of very small changes in DNA methylation
is not known, and, even if these associations exist, their
contribution to the epigenome may be negligible. Overall, we are
cautious in our interpretation of these ﬁndings and believe they
should be investigated in future studies.

Our study has several limitations. The sample size is small,
which limits our ability to detect associations between these
epigenetic marks and lifestyle modiﬁcations. It is also unclear
how the duration of the intervention affects changes in epige-
netic biomarkers. Increases in LINE-1 DNA methylation were
observed at 6 mo after the initiation of the intervention and
persisted to month 12, suggesting stability after the initial
change. However, a longer intervention could provide informa-
tion about the sustained effect of lifestyle changes in blood DNA
methylation levels. An additional limitation is the assessment of
dietary information, which was obtained from a self-reported
questionnaire. As we previously noted about this particular study,
given that the majority of the participants were overweight or
obese and the mean reported caloric intake was 1250 kcal/d, it is
likely that study participants underestimated their dietary intake
(28). Inaccurate reporting at baseline for total caloric intake could
result in an underestimation or an overestimation of mean percent
change at 12 mo, which would affect the association with DNA
methylation. Lastly, a common challenge using total WBCs is the
heterogeneity in cell type composition (55). The relative amounts
of the different blood cell fractions vary across individuals and
might affect global DNA methylation biomarker levels (22).
Therefore, care should be taken when comparing results to other
studies.

Future studies should include a larger sample, with a poten-
tially extended intervention and intermediate monitoring points
to better assess the rate at which changes to epigenetic marks take
place in blood. In addition, it is important to consider that the
changes we expect to observe as a result of dietary interventions

788 Delgado-Cruzata et al.

will not be large and most likely would be cumulative as a result of
additional interactions with environmental, lifestyle, and demo-
graphic factors (56). Despite its limitations, our study contributes
to the growing evidence that suggests that the health impacts of
changes in dietary habits and other lifestyle factors may be
mediated through epigenetic modiﬁcations. Our study provides
preliminary evidence for the use of WBC DNA methylation
biomarkers to monitor lifestyle interventions. However, larger
and longer lifestyle interventions are needed to clearly assess the
effects on global DNA methylation levels.

Abstract

Background: Results from preclinical studies suggest that ﬂavonoids, which are ubiquitous in plant-based diets, lower

breast cancer risk. Epidemiologic studies of ﬂavonoid intake and breast cancer risk, however, are limited, and few
investigated associations with the more aggressive estrogen receptor (ER)–negative (ER2) tumors.

Objective: We examined the associations between 7 subclasses of dietary ﬂavonoids and invasive postmenopausal breast

cancer risk overall and by ER status in a U.S. prospective cohort.

Methods: In 1999–2000, 56,630 postmenopausal women completed detailed self-administered questionnaires, among whom

2116 invasive breast cancers were veriﬁed during a mean follow-up period of 8.5 y. Cox proportional hazards regression was

used to calculate multivariable-adjusted HRs and 95% CIs.

Results: Total ﬂavonoid intake was not associated with breast cancer risk. However, there was a modest inverse association
between ﬂavone intake and overall breast cancer risk (ﬁfth vs. ﬁrst quintile HR: 0.88; 95% CI: 0.76, 1.01; P-trend = 0.04) and
between ﬂavan-3-ol intake and risk of ER2 breast cancer (for an increment of 40 mg/d; HR: 0.81; 95% CI: 0.67, 0.97) but not for

ER-positive (ER+) breast cancer risk.
Conclusion: The inverse association of ﬂavan-3-ol intake with ER2 but not ER+ breast cancer is consistent with other studies
that suggest a beneﬁcial role of plant-based diets in ER2 breast cancer risk. J. Nutr. 144: 1603–1611, 2014.

Introduction

Despite advances in the early detection, treatment, and chemopre-
vention of breast cancer, this malignancy remains the most
commonly diagnosed non–skin cancer and the second most
common cause of cancer mortality among women in the United
States (1). Breast cancer is considered a heterogeneous disease in
that hormone receptor–positive and –negative breast cancers
differ in their etiology, response to treatment, and prognosis (2–
4). Several hormone-related risk factors such as early menarche,
late age at ﬁrst birth, and late age at menopause are more strongly
related to estrogen receptor (ER)7–positive (ER+) than ER-negative

(ER2) breast cancers, which are more aggressive and carry a
poorer 5-y prognosis (2,4,5). There are no known strategies for
reducing the risk of the difﬁcult to treat ER2 breast cancers.
However, recent studies suggest that a higher intake of fruits and
vegetables is associated with a lower risk of breast cancers (6),
especially ER2 breast cancers (7). Large pooled analyses showed
inverse associations of both serum (8) and dietary carotenoids (9)
with risk of ER2 but not ER+ tumors.

In addition to carotenoids, ﬂavonoids, including proanthocyani-
dins, are also abundant in plant foods. Comprising a large group of
polyphenolic compounds, >4000 ﬂavonoids have been identiﬁed,
with 6 principal subclasses commonly found in human diets
(anthocyanins, ﬂavan-3-ols, ﬂavanones, ﬂavones, ﬂavonols, and
isoﬂavones). Proanthocyanidins, polymers of ﬂavan-3-ols, are
concentrated in fruits (except for citrus), chocolate or cocoa, and
red wine (10,11). Although they have been less studied than the 6
subclasses of monomeric ﬂavonoids because of lack of information
to quantify their presence in food, a higher degree of polymerization
seems to be associated with stronger inverse associations with
cancer risk (12,13). These compounds are potentially effective
anticancer agents in vitro and in vivo, possibly due to their
antioxidant, anti-inﬂammatory, antiproliferative, and apoptosis-
inducing properties as shown in preclinical studies of breast cancer

(14–16). Some ﬂavonoids that are phytoestrogens, including
ﬂavones and isoﬂavones, may reduce the risk of breast cancer
through estrogen-dependent mechanisms (17).

A recent meta-analysis of both prospective cohort studies and
case-control studies suggested that intakes of ﬂavonols and
ﬂavones are associated with a lower risk of breast cancer, es-
pecially among postmenopausal women (18), but the evidence
from case-control studies that are subject to recall bias is stronger
than that from prospective cohort studies. Most early epidemi-
ologic studies of ﬂavonoids focused on single compounds in
relation to breast cancer risk, but recently available ﬂavonoid and
proanthocyanidin databases (19,20) have enabled a more com-
prehensive evaluation of ﬂavonoids and health outcomes. Fur-
thermore, few studies stratiﬁed analyses on ER status (21–23).
The present study investigated the associations of 7 subclasses of
ﬂavonoids (including total proanthocyanidins) estimated from
comprehensive USDA ﬂavonoid databases with invasive breast
cancer risk by ER status in the Cancer Prevention Study II (CPS-II)
Nutrition Cohort. The large sample size of the CPS-II Nutrition
Cohort allowed for the examination of risk by ER status.

Participants and Methods

Study population. Participants in this study were drawn from the
;98,000 women enrolled in the CPS-II Nutrition Cohort, a prospective
cohort study of cancer incidence and mortality initiated in 1992 (24).
The CPS-II Nutrition Cohort is a subset of ;1.2 million U.S. adults in
the CPS-II, a prospective cohort study of cancer mortality established by
the American Cancer Society in 1982 (25). In 1992–1993, participants
in the CPS-II cohort who resided in 21 states with population-based
cancer registries were invited to participate in the CPS-II Nutrition
Cohort study. At enrollment, participants completed a 10-page, self-
administered questionnaire that included anthropometric, demographic,
dietary, lifestyle, and medical information. Follow-up questionnaires to
update exposure information and ascertain newly diagnosed cancers
were mailed in 1997 and every other year thereafter. All aspects of the
Nutrition Cohort study were approved by the Emory University
Institutional Review Board.

Analytic cohort. Follow-up for this analysis began on the date of
completion of the 1999 follow-up questionnaire, when a 152-item
modiﬁed Willett FFQ, which included speciﬁc questions on ﬂavonoid-
rich foods and beverages, was ﬁrst administered (24). At baseline in
1999–2000, 73,640 women returned the FFQ. We excluded from the
analysis women who were lost to follow-up (n = 1752), who reported
prevalence of any cancer except for nonmelanoma skin cancer on or
before the 1999 questionnaire (n = 13,655), and who were pre- or
perimenopausal or with missing menopausal status (n = 224). We further
excluded women who reported extreme energy intakes (>3500 or <600
kcal/d) or who had >70 line items missing on the 1999 FFQ (n = 916) or
$50% ﬂavonoid-rich food items missing (n = 144). Women who were in
the top 0.1% of individual ﬂavonoid subclass intake were also excluded
to limit over-reporting (n = 319). A total of 56,630 postmenopausal
women were included in the analytic cohort.

Exposure assessment. For each line item on the FFQ, a common food
or beverage serving size was speciﬁed [e.g., 1 banana or 8 ounces (;237
mL) soy milk]. Participants were asked how often, on average, they had
consumed this amount over the previous year. The possible frequency
responses ranged from ‘‘never’’ to ‘‘5 or more per week,’’ or to ‘‘6 or more
times per day,’’ depending on the item. Dietary intake of 6 subclasses of
ﬂavonoids and total proanthocyanidins were derived from 3 USDA
databases (20,26,27) as well as other literature (28–30) as described
elsewhere (31). Total proanthocyanidins were the sum of monomers,
dimers, trimers, 4–6 mers, 7–10 mers, and >10 mers as well as theaﬂavins
and thearubigins, which are derived tannins. Total ﬂavonoids were
deﬁned as the sum of the 7 subclasses (anthocyanidins, ﬂavones,

1604 Wang et al.

ﬂavanones, ﬂavan-3-ols, ﬂavonols, isoﬂavones, and proanthocyanidins),
including both monomeric and polymeric ﬂavonoids. Percentage con-
tributions of food sources to ﬂavonoids were calculated among all
participants as the ratio of total intake of ﬂavonoids from a food source
divided by the total amount of ﬂavonoids consumed in the population
(Supplemental Table 1).

Outcome ascertainment. Follow-up for the analytic cohort started
from the return of the 1999 FFQ and ended at the date of breast cancer
diagnosis or breast cancer death, date of other death, date of last survey
returned, or 30 June 2009, whichever came ﬁrst. During a mean follow-
up period of 8.5 y, 2116 invasive breast cancers were identiﬁed, includ-
ing 1498 ER+ cases and 218 ER2 cases. A majority of the incident cases
(n = 2075) were self-reported and veriﬁed subsequently through medi-
cal records (n = 1671) or through linkage with state cancer registries
(n = 404). Three self-reported cases that were not veriﬁed were identiﬁed
through linkage with the National Death Index (32). Another 13 cases
that were not self-reported were identiﬁed through medical records
(n = 2) or linkage with state cancer registry (n = 11) during the process of
verifying another cancer. Fatal breast cancer cases (n = 25) that were not
reported were identiﬁed through linkage with the National Death Index,
and 17 of these were veriﬁed through state cancer registries.

Statistical analysis. Energy-adjusted ﬂavonoid intakes, calculated by
using the residual method (33), were examined as categorical variables in
quintiles based on distributions in the entire cohort as well as continuous
variables with ;1 SD as the incremental unit. Cox proportional hazards
regression models were used to calculate HRs and 95% CIs for breast
cancer risk by quintile of ﬂavonoid intake and by continuous form. When
ER+ and ER2 cases were examined as separate outcomes, cases that were
non-ER+ or non-ER2, including those missing ER status, were censored.
Age was adjusted in all Cox models by stratifying on single year of
age at enrollment. For other covariates, missing values <5% were
included in the largest category; otherwise missing values were grouped
as an ‘‘unknown’’ category. Additional covariates controlled for in the
multivariable models included family history of breast cancer (yes, no/
unknown), history of breast cyst (yes, no/unknown), weight gain since
age 18 y ($24.5–4.5 kg, >4.5–9 kg, >9–18 kg, >18–25 kg, >25 kg,
unknown), education (less than high school graduate, high school grad-
uate, some college, college graduate or higher/unknown), combination
of parity and age at ﬁrst live birth (nulliparous; 1–2, <25 y; 1–2, $25 y;
$3, <25 y/unknown; $3, $25 y), age at menopause (#44 y, 45–49 y,
50–54 y/unknown, $55 y), ethanol intake (no consumption/unknown,
<14 g/d, $14 g/d), smoking history (never/unknown, former, current),
and energy intake (quintiles). History of postmenopausal hormone
therapy was included in the model as a time-dependent variable. Energy-
adjusted dietary total carotenoid intake was also considered in a separate
model that included all of the above covariates. Other potential
confounders examined included age at menarche, BMI, saturated fat
intake, history of mammography, multivitamin use, physical activity,
and race. These variables were not included in the ﬁnal model because
their inclusion did not change the HR in the top category of exposures
>3%. Trend tests were conducted by assigning each quintile its median
value and modeling the exposure as a continuous variable.

We examined interactions between total ﬂavonoid intake and BMI
(<25 kg/m2, $25 kg/m2), weight change since age 18 (#9 kg, >9 kg),
smoking status (never, ever), and ethanol intake (none, any) by using the
likelihood ratio test (34). SAS version 9.3 (SAS Institute) was used to
conduct all statistical analyses. All P values are 2-sided and considered
signiﬁcant at the <0.05 level.

Results

The top 10 food contributors to total ﬂavonoids and each
ﬂavonoid subclass are listed in Supplemental Table 1. Although
in some cases a single food item was the primary contributor to
some ﬂavonoids (e.g., nonherbal tea to ﬂavan-3-ols and tofu/soy
beans to isoﬂavones), most of the ﬂavonoids were derived from
multiple major foods or beverages. As shown in Table 1, women

with higher total ﬂavonoid intake at baseline were more likely to
have a history of breast cysts, a higher educational level, had 1–2
live births, and a later age at menopause. They also engaged in
healthier lifestyle behaviors. They were leaner and less likely to
gain >18 kg after age 18 y, to smoke, or to consume $14 g (;1
serving) of alcohol/d. They were more likely to have mammo-
graphic screening, take multivitamin supplements regularly,
and exercise frequently. As expected, women who consumed
high dietary ﬂavonoids reported high consumption of tea,
wine, fruits and vegetables, and dietary total carotenoids
(Table 1).

Total ﬂavonoid intake was not associated with overall breast
cancer risk in age- or multivariable-adjusted models (Table 2). There
was a suggestive inverse association between ﬂavone intake in both
categorical (P-trend = 0.04) and continuous (for an increment of
1 mg/d; HR: 0.96; 95% CI: 0.92, 1.00) forms and risk, although the
HR of the top vs. bottom quintile (HR: 0.88; 95% CI: 0.76, 1.01; P =
0.06) was not signiﬁcant. Furthermore, the suggestive inverse trend
was no longer signiﬁcant after further adjustment for total carot-
enoid intake (P-trend = 0.12; data not shown), which was likely due
to the high correlation between ﬂavones and total carotenoids
(SpearmanÕs correlation coefﬁcient = 0.51, P < 0.0001).

In analyses stratiﬁed on ER status (Table 3), there were no
associations between any ﬂavonoid quintiles and risk of ER+ or
ER2 breast cancer. Analyses of continuous ﬂavonoids revealed a
suggestive lower risk of ER+ breast cancer for every 1-mg/d
increase in dietary ﬂavones (HR: 0.96; 95% CI: 0.91, 1.00) and a
19% lower risk of ER2 breast cancer (HR: 0.81; 95% CI: 0.67,
0.97) for an increment of 40 mg/d of dietary ﬂavan-3-ols (;1 SD).
The association of ﬂavan-3-ols with ER2 remained signiﬁcant
after further adjustment for dietary total carotenoid intake (HR:
0.81; 95% CI: 0.67, 0.98; data not shown). No signiﬁcant
interactions were observed between any ﬂavonoids and BMI (<25
kg/m2, $25 kg/m2), weight gain from age 18 y (#9 kg, >9 kg),
smoking status (never, ever), or alcohol consumption (none, any).

Discussion

This study investigated the associations of 7 subclasses of
ﬂavonoids with invasive breast cancer incidence by ER status in

a cohort of postmenopausal women. Although total ﬂavonoid
intake was not associated with invasive breast cancer risk
overall, ﬂavones, found primarily in vegetables (e.g., peppers,
celery), showed a suggestive inverse association with risk. In
addition, women with a higher intake of ﬂavan-3-ols were at
lower risk of ER2, but not ER+, breast cancer.

Our ﬁnding that ﬂavone intake was inversely associated
with all invasive breast cancer risk among these postmeno-
pausal women was consistent with the results from a recent
meta-analysis (18). The meta-analysis of 6 prospective cohort
studies and 6 case-control studies on ﬂavonoid intake and
breast cancer revealed a 17% and 12% lower risk of breast
cancer in women with high intakes of ﬂavones and ﬂavonols,
respectively (18). Although other prospective cohort studies
have been null (21,35–39), signiﬁcant inverse associations
between ﬂavonoid intake and breast cancer risk were shown
in 3 case-control studies (23,40,41). The Long Island Breast
Cancer Study Project with population-based, age-matched
controls found that higher reported intakes of ﬂavones,
ﬂavonols, and ﬂavan-3-ols consumed 1 y before diagnosis
were inversely associated with overall breast cancer risk,
mostly among postmenopausal women (23). Two other
hospital-based case-control studies also reported inverse associ-
ations between ﬂavone intake and risk of breast cancer (40,41).
The main food sources of ﬂavones in the current study were
green or red peppers, oranges, and celery, although oranges are
also rich in ﬂavanones. Although isoﬂavones, key phytoestro-
gens, have been widely studied in relation to breast cancer risk,
recent meta-analyses revealed signiﬁcant inverse associations
from studies in Asian countries but not from Western coun-
tries, where intake is dramatically lower (42,43). In the present
study, isoﬂavone intake was not associated with breast cancer
risk. The low amount and narrow range of isoﬂavone intake in
the present study (median: 0.03 mg/d; range: 0.02–45.0 mg/d),
similar to amounts reported in most Western countries, limits
the ability to detect associations with breast cancer risk, if
one exists.

An advantage of this study was the examination of risk by ER
status of the tumor, which has been reported in only 3 other
studies (21–23). Two case-control studies that stratiﬁed on ER and
progesterone receptor (PR) status had inconsistent results (22,23).

2 Adjusted for age, family history of breast cancer, history of breast cyst, weight gain since age 18 y, education, combination of parity and age at ﬁrst live birth, age at menopause,
ethanol consumption, smoking history, total energy intake in quintile, and history of hormone replacement therapy (time-dependent).
3 The incremental units were calculated as the approximate values of an SD. The increments are 220 mg/d for total ﬂavonoids, 10 mg/d for anthocyanidins, 40 mg/d for ﬂavan-3-
ols, 20 mg/d for ﬂavanones, 1 mg/d for ﬂavones, 10 mg/d for ﬂavonols, 3 mg/d for isoﬂavones, and 170 mg/d for proanthocyanidins.
4 Test for trend by using median values for each category and modeling as a continuous variable.

Cho et al. (22) reported an inverse association between isoﬂavone
intake and overall breast cancer risk among postmenopausal
women; when examined by ER status, the inverse association
persisted only for ER2 breast cancer. Fink et al. (23) reported
inverse associations for ﬂavone, ﬂavonol, and ﬂavan-3-ol intakes
with postmenopausal breast cancer risk overall, and ﬂavones and
ﬂavonols were associated with lower risk of ER+/PR+ and all
other types (as 1 group), whereas ﬂavan-3-ols were not associated
with risk of any type. In the EPIC (European Prospective
Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition) study, a large multina-
tional cohort study, intake of dietary ﬂavonoids and lignans
(another class of polyphenols) was not associated with risk of
breast cancer overall or by joint ER and PR status (21). In the
present study, we observed signiﬁcant inverse associations be-
tween ﬂavan-3-ol intake and incidence of ER2, but not ER+,
breast tumors. Although the ﬁnding might be due to chance,
experimental studies had results that are consistent with the
observed inverse association. Epigallocatechin gallate, a primary
ﬂavan-3-ol in green tea, has been suggested to be a potential
anticarcinogenic agent for ER2 breast cancer. In ER2 human
breast cancer cell lines, epigallocatechin gallate inhibited breast
cancer cell proliferation (44,45) and induced apoptosis (46). In
a recent study, epigallocatechin gallate was also found to
reactivate ER-a expression in an ER2 breast cancer cell line
through inﬂuencing epigenetic processes (47). Our ﬁndings
need to be conﬁrmed in future studies.

Identifying the independent associations of speciﬁc dietary
components with cancer risk is difﬁcult because many com-
pounds are present in the same food groups. In the present
study, dietary ﬂavone intake was inversely associated with
invasive breast cancer; however, the association was no longer
signiﬁcant after further adjustment for total carotenoid intake.
One plausible cause is the collinearity between these 2
compounds that are often found in the same fruits and
vegetables. On the other hand, the inverse association between
dietary ﬂavan-3-ols and ER2 breast cancer was not affected by
control for carotenoid consumption, probably because >50%
of the dietary ﬂavan-3-ols were from tea and only a small
portion of ﬂavan-3-ols share common food sources with
carotenoids. We did not include carotenoids in our main
multivariable models because their shared food sources may
represent overcontrol.

This study has several strengths, including its large sample
size, prospective design with 10 y of follow-up, and use of
comprehensive ﬂavonoid databases. It also has limitations.
Dietary estimates based on FFQs are subject to error resulting
from the ﬁnite food list and potential misreporting of
retrospective food intake (48). In a prospective study, these
sources of error might lead to random misclassiﬁcation of
exposure, which could attenuate possible associations. How-
ever, although the FFQ used to estimate ﬂavonoid intake was
not validated in the CPS-II cohort speciﬁcally, the instrument
on which our FFQ is based has been validated in similar
populations (49,50), and we previously showed that dietary
ﬂavonoid intake was inversely associated with cardiovascular
disease mortality in the CPS-II Nutrition Cohort
(51),
consistent with expectations and supporting the predictive
validity of our dietary data. In the current study, it is possible
that we may have missed stronger inverse associations of
ﬂavonoid intake with breast cancer incidence because of
greater under-reporting of energy intake and over-reporting
of fruit and vegetable intake among overweight or obese
women (52,53), who are at higher risk of breast cancer.
Although available potential confounders were examined in
multivariable models, residual confounding due to other
unmeasured factors and incomplete classiﬁcation of cova-
riates may inﬂuence the risk estimates in this study.

Although total ﬂavonoid intake was not associated with overall
breast cancer risk, ﬂavones were associated with a borderline lower
risk of invasive breast cancers in our study. Moreover, this study
showed a signiﬁcant inverse association between ﬂavan-3-ol intake
and ER2, but not ER+, breast cancer risk. Our ﬁnding for ﬂavan-
3-ols and ER2 breast cancer is consistent with other research that
suggests a role of plant-based diets in reducing the risk of ER2
breast cancer. Future pooled analysis of large cohort studies is
warranted to replicate the ﬁndings.

Abstract

Background: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States, with a 5-y
survival rate of ;65%. Therefore, the identiﬁcation of modiﬁable health factors to improve CRC survival is crucial.

Objective: We investigated the association of 4 prediagnostic a priori diet quality indexes with CRC-speciﬁc and all-cause

mortality in the Multiethnic Cohort (MEC).

Methods: The MEC included >215,000 African-American, Native Hawaiian, Japanese-American, Latino, and white adults

living in Hawaii and California who completed a validated quantitative food-frequency questionnaire in 1993–1996. CRC

cases and deaths were identiﬁed through linkages to cancer registries and to state and national vital registries. Sex-

speciﬁc HRs and 95% CIs were estimated for the Healthy Eating Index (HEI) 2010, the Alternative HEI (AHEI) 2010, the

alternate Mediterranean Diet (aMED) score, and the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) index with

CRC-speciﬁc and overall mortality as the primary outcomes. Ethnicity-speciﬁc analyses were the secondary outcomes.

Results: Among 4204 MEC participants diagnosed with invasive CRC through 2010, 1976 all-cause and 1095 CRC-speciﬁc

deaths were identiﬁed. A higher aMED score was associated with lower CRC-speciﬁc mortality in women [HR continuous

pattern score divided by its respective SD (HR1SD): 0.86; 95% CI: 0.77, 0.96] but not in men (HR1SD: 1.01; 95% CI: 0.92,
1.11). A higher aMED score was also associated with lower all-cause mortality in women (HR1SD: 0.88; 95% CI: 0.81, 0.96)
but not in men (HR1SD: 1.00; 95% CI: 0.93, 1.07). The HEI-2010, AHEI-2010, and DASH index were not signiﬁcantly
associated with CRC-speciﬁc or with all-cause mortality. The inverse relation for the aMED score was limited to African

Americans and to colon (compared with rectal) cancer.

Conclusions: The aMED score was related to lower mortality only in African-American women (1 of 5 ethnic groups

studied). The results should be interpreted with caution due to the small numbers of cases within ethnic groups and the
issue of multiple testing. J Nutr 2016;146:1746–55.

posteriori patterns, were associated with a lower risk of developing
CRC (4, 5). The few studies that investigated dietary indexes in
relation to CRC survival are contradictory. One US study reported
lower CRC-speciﬁc mortality among rectal cancer cases with higher
prediagnostic HEI-2005 scores but not among colon cancer cases
(6). In a European cohort, greater prediagnostic concordance with
the World Cancer Research Fund guidelines was associated with a
lower CRC-speciﬁc mortality (7). Although higher postdiagnostic
AHEI-2010 scores predicted lower all-cause mortality in 1201
women with CRC (8), the AHEI-2010, the alternate Mediterranean
Diet (aMED) score, the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension
(DASH) index, and a posteriori Western and prudent patterns were
not signiﬁcantly related to CRC-speciﬁc mortality. In contrast, a
posteriori patterns rich in meat as well as higher meat consumption
predicted a poorer CRC prognosis and all-cause mortality in several
analyses (9–12).

Poor prediagnostic diet quality is linked to a suboptimal
micronutrient status that is likely to become even worse after
diagnosis (e.g., due to adverse effects from treatment). Certain
micronutrients have an impact on oxidative stress (13) and cell
differentiation (14), both predictors of CRC risk and progres-
sion. Micronutrient status may therefore be a potential under-
lying biological mechanism of the association of dietary patterns
with survival. Recent studies also point toward a role of the
human gut microbiome composition as a potential mediator of
diet and CRC development and progression (15, 16). Most of
the published studies were conducted in relatively homoge-
nous populations composed of non-Hispanic whites. Given that
Japanese Americans and African Americans are at a higher risk
to develop CRC than whites (17) and that African Americans
experience higher CRC mortality (1), research in ethnically
diverse populations is of great interest. We therefore investi-
gated the association of 4 prediagnostic a priori indexes—the
HEI-2010 (18), the AHEI-2010 (19), the aMED score (20), and
the DASH index (21)—with all-cause and CRC-speciﬁc mor-
tality among white, African-American, Japanese-American,
Native Hawaiian, and Latino participants with CRC in the
Multiethnic Cohort (MEC).

Methods

Study population. The MEC is an ethnically diverse prospective cohort
designed to investigate the association of lifestyle and genetic factors
with the incidence of cancer. The design and implementation of the MEC
have been described elsewhere (22). Brieﬂy, >215,000 men and women
aged 45–75 y at recruitment, and residing in Hawaii or California
(primarily Los Angeles County), were enrolled in the cohort between
1993 and 1996. To obtain a multiethnic sample of whites, African
Americans, Native Hawaiians, Japanese Americans, and Latinos, a
population-based sampling frame used drivers’ license ﬁles, supplemented
with voter registration lists and Health Care Financing Administration

(Medicare) ﬁles. The institutional review boards at the University of
Hawaii and the University of Southern California approved the study
protocol.

Incident colon and rectal cancer cases were identiﬁed through regular
linkages to the Los Angeles County Cancer Surveillance Program, the
State of California Cancer Registry, and the statewide Hawaii Tumor
Registry, all members of the National Cancer InstituteÕs Surveillance,
Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program. Dates and causes of
death were identiﬁed by routine linkages with California and Hawaii
vital records and the National Death Index databases. Information on
incident cases and/or death ascertainment was available up to 31
December 2010. Among eligible participants of the 5 major ethnic
groups who had not developed colon or rectal cancer before cohort
entry, 4832 newly diagnosed invasive CRC cases were identiﬁed through
2010. After exclusions [272, not adenocarcinoma; 179, invalid diet; 1,
did not survive after diagnosis; 69, missing BMI at cohort entry; and 166,
with BMI (in kg/m2) <18.5, with some overlap], 4204 cohort members
diagnosed with invasive CRC during follow-up were included in the
current analysis.

Data collection. At cohort entry, participants completed a self-
administered, 26-page questionnaire [questionnaire at cohort entry
(Qx1)] that collected self-reported demographic characteristics, height
and body weight, medical history, family history of colon and rectal
cancer, physical activity, and a diet history by using a quantitative FFQ
(QFFQ). The QFFQ asked participants to report their average frequency
of consumption and serving sizes for >180 food items during the past
year. A calibration study indicated acceptable correlations between the
QFFQ and 24-h recalls for all sex and ethnic groups (23). Between 1999
and 2002, ;85% of eligible MEC members completed a brief follow-up
questionnaire [questionnaire 2 (Qx2)] providing updated information on
self-reported body weight. In 2003–2008, a subset of MEC participants
responded to a follow-up questionnaire [questionnaire 3 (Qx3)] that
included a full QFFQ. Information on stage at diagnosis and ﬁrst course
of treatment but not recurrence was available from the SEER registries in
Hawaii and Los Angeles.

Dietary indexes. Dietary indexes were a priori deﬁned and based on
work conducted by the Dietary Patterns Methods Project (24–26).
Scoring was based on food groups from the MyPyramid Equivalents
Database. The portion sizes were converted to cup and ounce equivalents
as required for MyPyramid Equivalents Databases. The 4 indexes, as
described in detail previously (26), use different scoring systems and
focus on diverse aspects of the diet, although they share an emphasis on
several major food groups (Supplemental Table 1). The HEI-2010
includes 12 components (total fruit, whole fruit, total vegetables, dark
green vegetables and legumes, whole grains, dairy, total protein foods,
seafood and plant proteins, ratio of PUFAs and MUFAs to SFAs, reﬁned
grains, sodium, and empty calories) and reﬂects the 2010 Dietary
Guidelines for Americans, with higher scores reﬂecting better adherence
to federal dietary guidelines (18). The AHEI-2010 includes 11 foods and
nutrients [total vegetables excluding potatoes, whole fruit, whole grains,
sugar-sweetened beverages and fruit juice, nuts, soy and legumes, trans
FAs, long-chain (n–3) FAs (EPA + DHA), PUFAs, sodium, alcohol, and
red and processed meat] predictive of chronic diseases such as type 2
diabetes or cardiovascular disease (19).

The aMED score, as developed by Fung et al. (20), includes 9
components (total vegetables excluding potatoes, total fruit, nuts,
legumes, ﬁsh, whole grains, MUFA to SFA ratio, alcohol, and red and
processed meat) and was an adaptation of the Mediterranean Diet Score
developed by Trichopoulou et al. (27) that takes into account scientiﬁc
literature on diet and chronic disease risk. The DASH index as outlined
by Fung et al. (21) includes 8 components (total vegetables excluding
potatoes; total fruit; nuts, seeds, and legumes; low-fat dairy; whole
grains; sodium; sugar-sweetened beverages and fruit juices; and red and
processed meat) that are emphasized in the DASH diet designed for
hypertension management.

All 4204 CRC cases in this study had information on dietary patterns
derived from the questionnaire at cohort study (Qx1; 1993–1996). Of
these, 35.8% completed Qx3; 953 participants did so after their CRC

diagnosis (with 77 CRC-speciﬁc and 212 all-cause deaths) and 552 CRC
cases before their CRC diagnosis (with 97 CRC-speciﬁc and 151 all-
cause deaths). Given the low number of CRC cases with information on
postdiagnostic diet, we used prediagnostic dietary index scores derived
from Qx1 for the current analysis. Nevertheless, correlations between
prediagnostic (Qx1) and postdiagnostic (Qx3) dietary index scores
indicated acceptable consistency with the following correlation coefﬁ-
cients: HEI-2010 = 0.50, AHEI = 0.52, aMED = 0.46, and DASH = 0.55
(all P < 0.0001). The mean differences between pre- and postdiagnostic
dietary index score points indicated a slight improvement of the
HEI-2010 score after diagnosis (HEI-2010: 4.3 score points) and no
substantial changes in the AHEI-2010, aMED, and DASH scores
(AHEI-2010: 1.3 score points; aMED: 20.21 score points; and DASH:
20.22 score points).

Statistical analysis. To evaluate the association of dietary indexes with
all-cause and CRC-speciﬁc death, we computed multivariable-adjusted
HRs and 95% CIs with the use of Cox proportional hazards models of
mortality separately for men and women as our primary outcome. Given
sex differences in a previous study (10), we decided a priori to analyze
men and women separately. We formally tested the Schoenfeld residual
regression and found that the proportional hazards assumption of the
Cox model was fulﬁlled. Age was used as the time metric, beginning with
the age at CRC diagnosis and ending with the age at death or censoring
on 31 December 2010. For CRC-speciﬁc death, deaths due to other
causes were censored. The dietary index scores were divided into
quartiles on the basis of the baseline distribution of CRC cases. However,
due to the limited range in scores for the aMED and DASH the 4
categories may be slightly different. To evaluate possible dose-response
relations and to compare the regression parameters across indexes, trend
variables based on the ratio of each index value by its respective standard
deviation were tested. In addition, trend tests were performed across
index score quartiles while modeling the medians as continuous variable.
Self-reported hypertension, heart disease, and stroke from Qx1 were
used to create a variable for comorbidity (0, 1, or 2+). Various covariates
were included in the models as potential confounders based on previous
publications and on survival analyses within the MEC (28, 29). In the
minimally adjusted model, we included age at CRC diagnosis in 10-y age
groups, ethnicity, and SEER tumor stage (local, regional, distant, or
unknown). In the fully adjusted model, we additionally included
education, family history of CRC, BMI, smoking status and number of
pack-years, physical activity, total energy intake, comorbidity, SEER
tumor stage (local, regional, distant, or unknown), radiation and
chemotherapy treatment, and nonsteroidal anti-inﬂammatory drug
(NSAID) use. Physical activity was divided into <0.5 or $0.5 h/d spent
performing moderate or vigorous activities. Family history of colon or
rectal cancer included a self-report of the cancer in the participantÕs
natural father, mother, or full siblings. Education was coded as high
school or less, vocational school or some college, and undergraduate or
graduate degree. Cigarette smoking was classiﬁed as never, past, or
current and pack-years were also computed. On the basis of questions
about aspirin or other pain medication, excluding acetaminophen,
NSAID use was coded as ever ($2 times/wk for $1 mo) or never. BMI
based on self-reported height and weight measures was classiﬁed as
normal weight (18.5 to <25), overweight (25–29.9), or obese ($30). For
covariates with missing values (i.e., education, smoking status, physical
activity, NSAID use, tumor stage, and treatment variables), a missing
category was created. BMI was treated as a time-varying exposure by using
values from the questionnaire at cohort entry (Qx1) and Qx2, as
appropriate (30). BMI at Qx1 was modeled for risk sets before the age at
Qx2, and BMI at Qx2 was modeled for risk sets after the age at Qx2. To
exclude the possibility that a broad categorization of physical activity and
BMI introduced residual confounding, we re-conducted the main analysis
with physical activity and BMI as continuous variables. The results were
virtually unchanged (data not shown) as were the risk estimates when the
year of diagnosis was included to control for cohort effects in dietary
patterns and treatment regimens (data not shown).

We investigated the importance of individual score components
for the association of the dietary pattern scores with CRC-speciﬁc and
all-cause mortality separately for men and women by including all

1748 Jacobs et al.

individual components simultaneously in a model for each of the 4
indexes. For signiﬁcant components, we performed conﬁrmatory anal-
yses with the respective individual component only. We examined
potential interactions of dietary indexes with ethnicity by using a global
Wald test of the cross-product terms modeling dietary indexes as a
continuous variable.

In secondary analyses, we explored ethnicity-speciﬁc models and
performed analyses stratiﬁed by postmenopausal estrogen treatment,
which was categorized as never estrogen use compared with past/current
use as reported at cohort entry (Qx1). In addition, cancers of the colon
and the rectum were examined separately in relation to dietary indexes,
which were signiﬁcantly related with mortality in the main analysis.
Finally, we stratiﬁed the analysis by stage of disease at diagnosis.

For our main analyses, Bonferroni correction was used to adjust for
multiple comparison (8 tests: 4 dietary indexes 3 2 sexes) for each
hypothesis (CRC-speciﬁc mortality and all-cause mortality), and P-trend
< 0.0065 was deemed signiﬁcant. For all other analyses, signiﬁcance was
deﬁned as P < 0.05. All of the analyses were conducted in SAS version 9.3
(SAS Institute).

Results

Of the 4204 CRC cases (Table 1), 1441 were Japanese American,
842 African American, 840 white, 805 Latino, and 276 Native
Hawaiian. The mean 6 SD age at diagnosis was 71.4 6 8.7 y.
Cases were diagnosed between cohort entry (1993–1996) and
December 2010, and the mean follow-up time was 6.0 6 4.7 y.
The majority of cases were diagnosed at a localized (n = 1854) or
regional (n = 1605) stage compared with a distant (n = 647) or
unknown (n = 98) stage. The sample included 1645 men and
1580 women with colon cancer, 591 men and 354 women with
rectal cancer, and 22 men and 12 women with a mixed form
of cancer. The respective percentages of overweight and obese
participants at cohort entry were 40% and 22%, respectively.
Men and women in the highest dietary index quartile had
lower BMIs, were more likely to be never smokers, and reported
higher physical activity. The 4 indexes were strongly associated
with each other (Supplemental Table 2), with the highest cor-
relations between HEI-2010 and DASH scores and the lowest
between HEI-2010 and aMED scores.

In our primary analysis, the multivariable-adjusted model in
women but not in men (Tables 2 and 3), continuous aMED score
divided by its SD predicted a 14% lower CRC-speciﬁc mortality
[HR continuous pattern score divided by its respective SD
(HR1SD): 0.86; 95% CI: 0.77, 0.96]. The results for all-cause
mortality were similar and showed signiﬁcant associations only
for the aMED score in women (HR1SD: 0.88; 95% CI: 0.81,
0.96). The HRs for HEI-2010 indicated a weak inverse
association with disease-speciﬁc mortality in women that did
not reach signiﬁcance (HR1SD: 0.91; 95% CI: 0.83, 1.00),
whereas CRC-speciﬁc mortality was not associated with the
AHEI-2010 or the DASH index. HEI-2010, AHEI-2010, and
DASH scores were not related to all-cause mortality. In the
minimally adjusted model, none of the index scores was
signiﬁcantly related with CRC-speciﬁc mortality. The continu-
ous HEI-2010 was signiﬁcantly inversely related to all-cause
mortality in both sexes, and 1 SD of aMED score was signif-
icantly inversely associated with all-cause mortality in women.
After correcting for multiple testing with the Bonferroni
method, signiﬁcant trends were observed across aMED quar-
tiles in women for CRC-speciﬁc (P-trend = 0.004) and all-cause
(P-trend = 0.0008) mortality in the fully adjusted model and for
aMED score and all-cause mortality (P trend = 0.005) in women
in the minimally adjusted model. With regard to individual
components, the most prominent ﬁnding for the aMED score was

that fruit consumption was related to better CRC-speciﬁc and all-
cause mortality in women but not in men (data not shown).

In men, none of the interaction terms for any of the dietary in-
dexes with ethnicity were signiﬁcant for CRC-speciﬁc or all-cause
mortality. In women, the interaction terms for the HEI-2010,
the AHEI-2010, the aMED score, and the DASH index with eth-
nicity were signiﬁcant for CRC-speciﬁc mortality (P-interactions =
0.01, 0.02, 0.04, and 0.04, respectively) and the interaction terms
for the HEI-2010, the AHEI-2010, and the DASH index with
ethnicity were signiﬁcant for all-cause mortality (P-interactions =
0.002, 0.01, and 0.005, respectively).

In our secondary analysis, ethnicity-speciﬁc results (Figure 1)
indicated that African Americans experienced lower mortality
with higher scores for the HEI-2010, aMED, and DASH, but
the risk estimates with regard to CRC-speciﬁc mortality were
signiﬁcant only in women. Higher aMED scores predicted lower
all-cause mortality among African-American women, whereas
higher DASH scores were associated with lower all-cause mortal-
ity among African-American women and men. When women
were stratiﬁed by postmenopausal estrogen treatment at cohort
entry, all 4 index scores were signiﬁcantly related to a lower CRC-
speciﬁc mortality in past and current users, whereas no associa-
tions were observed in nonusers; the results for all-cause mortality
were weaker but also reached signiﬁcance in all index scores
except for the AHEI-2010 (Table 4).

Separate models for the aMED score by cancer site indicated a
lower CRC-speciﬁc (HR: 0.85; 95% CI: 0.75, 0.97) and all-cause
(HR: 0.86; 95% CI: 0.79, 0.95) mortality for colon but not for
rectal cancer in women (data not shown). Stratiﬁcation by stage of
disease at diagnosis showed a signiﬁcant inverse association of
higher aMED scores in women but not in men with distant disease;
the respective HRs for women per a 1-SD unit were 0.82 (95% CI:
0.68, 0.98) and 0.84 (95% CI: 0.71, 1.00) for CRC-speciﬁc and all-
cause mortality, respectively. No signiﬁcant associations were
detected for localized and regional disease (data not shown).

Discussion

In this large multiethnic cohort composed of 5 major ethnic
groups, the prediagnostic aMED score was associated with lower
CRC-speciﬁc mortality and all-cause mortality in all women
as a group but not in men. No signiﬁcant associations of the
HEI-2010, the AHEI-2010, or the DASH scores with CRC-
speciﬁc mortality or all-cause mortality were detected. A number
of secondary analyses showed signiﬁcant associations of the
HEI-2010, aMED, and DASH scores with lower CRC-speciﬁc
mortality in African-American women, inverse associations of
all 4 dietary indexes with mortality in estrogen users but not in
nonusers, and stronger inverse associations for advanced than
for localized stage of disease at diagnosis.

In the current analysis, higher aMED scores but none of the
other examined dietary indexes were related to a lower CRC-
speciﬁc and all-cause mortality in women. None of the dietary
indexes were related to all-cause or CRC-speciﬁc mortality in
men. Note that the dietary indexes investigated in this analysis
were not developed speciﬁcally for cancer survival but for other
chronic conditions such as hypertension. The high correlations
of the dietary indexes in this study suggest some level of
agreement. Still, the less than perfect correlations conﬁrm that
each index represents a unique combination of dietary compo-
nents. The aMED score differs in many important ways from the
other indexes (Supplemental Table 1). The scores are more
determined by foods than nutrients, only 9 components are
emphasized, vegetables exclude potatoes, and alcohol intake
is part of the score. Another distinct property is that the con-
sumption of nuts and legumes makes a stronger contribution
than to any other index. Each is counted separately as ‘‘1’’ whereas
they are scored together in the AHEI-2010 and the DASH index
and nuts are not present in the HEI-2010. Legumes include
soy beans, a source of isoﬂavones that might affect cancer initi-
ation and progression through estrogenic and antiestrogenic activ-
ities (31). Nuts are sources of bioactive compounds, including

1 HRs (95% CIs) for an increase of 1 SD in the HEI-2010, AHEI-2010, aMED, and
DASH scores were obtained by Cox regression and adjusted for age at diagnosis,
smoking status, pack-years, physical activity, total energy intake, education, stage at
diagnosis, radiation, chemotherapy, NSAID use, family history of CRC, and comorbid-
ities. Data were missing for n = 178 for estrogen use at cohort entry. AHEI, Alternative

high prediagnostic serum folate was associated with lower CRC-
speciﬁc and all-cause mortality (37), ﬂavonoid supplements reduced
CRC recurrence (38), and patients with CRC with high circulating
25-hydroxyvitamin D had a lower risk of CRC-speciﬁc and all-cause
mortality in a meta-analysis of cohort studies (39). As another
potential mediator, the composition of the human gut microbiome is
known to be inﬂuenced by diet (15) and might be linked to CRC
development and progression (16).

The Mediterranean Diet Score was previously inversely
related with CRC risk and all-cause cancer mortality in a meta-
analysis of cohort and case-control studies (40). However,
no associations of the postdiagnostic AHEI-2010, aMED, and
DASH scores with CRC-speciﬁc mortality were detected among
1201 women from the NursesÕ Health Study (NHS) diagnosed
with stage I–III CRC (8). The index versions were similar and
cannot explain the observed differences across studies, but the
NHS used postdiagnostic diet, whereas we used prediagnostic
diet due to the small sample size of MEC participants with
information on postdiagnostic diet. Because pre- and postdiagnos-
tic dietary index scores showed minimal differences and signiﬁcant
correlations, it appears that no major dietary changes occurred.

Signiﬁcant ﬁndings were mainly restricted to women in this
study. Sex differences were also reported in an a posteriori
pattern and with CRC-speciﬁc survival analysis: for instance, the
adverse inﬂuence of the processed-meat pattern on survival was
more pronounced among women than men (10). The results of
the stratiﬁed analysis by postmenopausal estrogen use might
partly explain the observed sex differences, because inverse
associations for all 4 dietary indexes were limited to current or
past postmenopausal estrogen users. These ﬁndings point toward a
synergistic effect of diet and estrogen use as also seen in research
from the WomenÕs Health Initiative Estrogen-plus-Progestin Study
in which women taking hormone therapy had a lower risk of CRC
than did women taking a placebo (41). Current postmenopausal
estrogen use before CRC diagnosis was also associated with
improved CRC-speciﬁc and all-cause survival in the NHS (42).
There are several mechanisms for hormone exposure to protect
against development and progression of colon cancer. For example,

phytoestrogens and MUFAs. Only the aMED score includes the
component the ratio of MUFAs to SFAs, which was related to
lower all-cause mortality in a meta-analysis of cohort studies (32).
In addition, dichotomous scoring in the aMED may lead to greater
contrasts and better discrimination of eating patterns within the
population and provide more power for detecting differences. It
should be noted that due to differences in the median intakes of
foods, aMED results from studies conducted in the United States
are likely to differ from those of European studies.

The single-component analyses from our study suggest that
consumption of fruit may be a crucial component to lower
mortality in women. As a potential biological mechanism, fruit
is rich in phytochemicals (e.g., carotenoids), which were related
to a lower mortality in patients with CRC in the MEC (33) but
showed mixed results in other studies (34, 35). With regard to
other speciﬁc micronutrients, prediagnostic plasma concentra-
tions of the biologically active form of vitamin B-6 were not
associated with CRC-speciﬁc or all-cause mortality (36), whereas

cell studies suggest that exogenous estrogens could lead to slower
disease progression (43, 44).

Signiﬁcant associations of the HEI-2010, aMED, and DASH
scores with a lower CRC-speciﬁc mortality were seen in African-
American women only. Considering that most dietary indexes
were originally created and tested among participants of
European and African-American (for DASH) heritage, food
preferences of Japanese Americans, Native Hawaiians, and
Latinos might not be as well represented in the indexes. This
may partly explain the lack of associations among these ethnic
groups but not among white participants. Our ﬁndings are of
particular relevance given that African Americans are more
likely to be diagnosed with CRC than whites and have lower
survival rates (1). To our knowledge, no study has investigated
by using an ethnicity-speciﬁc design the associations of a priori
indexes with CRC-speciﬁc survival. In previous studies, white
and African-American participants showed different results in
analyses of exploratory dietary patterns with the risk of colon
(45) and rectal (46) cancer; for instance, the ‘‘Western-Southern,’’
‘‘fruit-vegetable,’’ and ‘‘metropolitan’’ intake patterns were identi-
ﬁed in both ethnic groups, but the ‘‘fruit-vegetable’’ pattern was
associated with colon cancer risk in whites only (45). In rectal
cancer, the ‘‘high fat/meat/potatoes’’ intake pattern was identiﬁed in
both ethnic groups; however, this was associated with risk only in
whites (46). Associations between single foods and CRC risk also
differed by ethnicity [e.g., ﬁber consumption was signiﬁcantly
associated with lower CRC risk in African Americans but not in
whites (47)]. Ethnicity-speciﬁc differences in the bacterial coloni-
zation of the gut (48) and the frequency of genetic polymorphisms
(49) may play a role in these ﬁndings.

In contrast to the associations among colon and not rectal
cancer cases in the current study, the predominantly white NIH-
AARP Diet and Health Study reported better CRC-speciﬁc survival
for rectal cancer cases with higher prediagnostic HEI-2005 scores,
whereas no association was observed among colon cancer cases
(6). Discrepancies in the results might be explained by different
HEI versions (HEI-2005 compared with HEI-2010), which differ,
for instance, by the introduction of the food groups ‘‘seafood and
plant proteins’’ and ‘‘reﬁned grains’’ in the HEI-2010 and the
replacement of the food group ‘‘oils and saturated fat’’ in the HEI-
2005 by the food group ‘‘ratio of unsaturated fatty acids to SFAs’’
in the HEI-2010. Different ﬁndings might also be explained by
differences in sample size and ethnic composition of the study
populations. The latter may be particularly relevant because of the
higher relative proportions of African Americans diagnosed with
colon cancer (22.0%) than rectal cancer (13.9%) in the MEC.

To our knowledge, this study is the ﬁrst to investigate the
association of 4 a priori–deﬁned dietary indexes with survival
among participants diagnosed with CRC from different ethnic
backgrounds. A strength of this study was its prospective design.
Because of the large number of cases, we were able to examine
tumors at speciﬁc anatomic sites. In addition, the use of a QFFQ
designed for the relevant ethnic populations enabled us to study
heterogeneous populations with wide variations in dietary
habits and allowed for differences in usual portion sizes.
Although the validation of the QFFQ with 24-h recalls indicated
acceptable results (23), self-reported diet by QFFQ is always a
limitation that may result in nondifferential misclassiﬁcation
and attenuated risk estimates (50). Small sample sizes in some
ethnic groups may have limited our ability to detect associations
or led to spurious ﬁndings due to multiple testing. However,
when Bonferroni-corrected, the reported dietary score associations
of our main analysis in women of all ethnic groups combined
remained signiﬁcant. Given the possibility of false-positive results

1754 Jacobs et al.

due to multiple testing, the ﬁndings of our secondary analyses (i.e.,
by ethnic group, hormone treatment, and disease stage) should be
interpreted with caution. These analyses are hypothesis-generating
only and need to be replicated in other cohorts.

Given that dietary patterns may change after cancer diagnosis,
another weakness of this study is that the exposure assessment
was distant to the outcomes. Signiﬁcant correlations and small
differences between pre- and postdiagnostic dietary index scores
in a subset of 953 patients in our study indicate an acceptable
consistency, however. Covariate exposures, such as smoking
status, may also change after cancer diagnosis. However, in our
study subset with information on postdiagnostic confounders,
the vast majority of prediagnosis nonsmokers and former
smokers remained in the respective group after diagnosis,
whereas 83 current smokers stopped smoking after the diagnosis
and pre- and postdiagnostic BMI correlated well (r = 0.82).

In this multiethnic cohort, African-American women diag-
nosed with CRC whose prediagnostic diet at cohort entry was
more closely aligned with the aMED experienced lower CRC
mortality. The observed ethnicity-speciﬁc associations could
be a result of true biological differences in metabolism, genetics,
and eating patterns or due to the smaller sample sizes for
ethnicity-speciﬁc analysis, particularly for Native Hawaiians.
Our ﬁndings highlight the importance of examining relations
between dietary patterns and CRC mortality in ethnically
diverse populations but also indicate that the associations between
prediagnostic diet quality and prognosis appear to be fairly weak.
Given the multiple testing issues and small numbers of cases
within ethnic groups, the current ﬁnding of an inverse association
between the aMED and mortality in 1 of 5 ethnic groups may be
due to chance and needs replication in other cohorts.

Abstract

Background: One-carbon metabolism—important for DNA stability and integrity—may play a role in breast carcinogen-

esis. However, epidemiologic studies addressing this issue have yielded inconsistent results.

Objective: We prospectively investigated associations between breast cancer and plasma folate, riboﬂavin, vitamin B-6,

vitamin B-12, and homocysteine in women recruited to the Varese (Italy) cohort of the EPIC (European Prospective

Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition) study.

Methods: We performed a nested case-control study on women aged 35–65 y at recruitment with a median body mass index
of 25.3 kg/m2 who gave blood samples in 1987–1992 and again in 1993–1998. Breast cancer cases identiﬁed by 31 December

2009 were individually matched to controls. RRs of breast cancer (and subtypes deﬁned by hormone receptor status) with 95%

CIs were estimated by unconditional logistic regression, controlling for matching factors and breast cancer risk factors.

Results: After a median of 14.9 y, 276 breast cancer cases were identiﬁed and matched to 276 controls. Increasing plasma

vitamin B-6 was associated with decreased risk of overall (RR: 0.78; 95% CI: 0.63, 0.96 for 1-SD increase), premenopausal

(RR: 0.66; 95% CI: 0.48, 0.92 for 1-SD increase), estrogen receptor-positive (RR: 0.79; 95% CI: 0.63, 1.00 for 1-SD

increase), and progesterone receptor-positive (RR: 0.72; 95% CI: 0.55, 0.95 for 1-SD increase) breast cancers. Increased
plasma vitamin B-6 was also associated with decreased breast cancer risk in alcohol consumers ($7 g/d) compared with

consumption of <7 g/d or nonconsumption (RR: 0.71; 95% CI: 0.51, 0.99). High plasma riboﬂavin was associated with

signiﬁcantly lower risk in premenopausal women (RR: 0.45; 95% CI: 0.21, 0.94; highest compared with the lowest
quartile, P trend = 0.021). Plasma homocysteine, folate, and vitamin B-12 were not associated with breast cancer risk.

Conclusions: High plasma vitamin B-6 and riboﬂavin may lower breast cancer risk, especially in premenopausal women.
Additional research is necessary to further explore these associations. J Nutr 2016;146:1227–34.

and thus play important roles in maintaining DNA stability and
integrity. Folate, as 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, is required to
remethylate homocysteine to methionine, which is converted
to S-adenosylmethionine. The latter provides methyl groups for
methylation reactions in general, and DNA and RNA biosyn-
thesis in particular (1–5). S-Adenosylmethionine depletion
induces DNA hypomethylation, which may lead to expression of
proto-oncogenes and eventually cancer (6). Folate deﬁciency
also results in deﬁcient methylation of uracil to thymine, so that
uracil is incorporated into DNA (2), leading to chromosome
breaks and carcinogenesis (3, 6). Vitamin B-12 deﬁciency is

expected to cause chromosome breaks by the same mechanism
as folate because it is an essential coenzyme in the methylation of
homocysteine to methionine (2, 4).

Vitamin B-6 is an essential coenzyme for several catabolic
and anabolic reactions. In particular it is required for the
conversion of tetrahydrofolate to 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofo-
late by serine hydroxymethyltransferase (2). 5,10-Methylenete-
trahydrofolate is required for the synthesis of nucleotides, which
are themselves necessary for DNA synthesis and repair. Vitamin
B-6 deﬁciency decreases the activity of serine hydroxymethyl-
transferase, thereby depleting the 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofo-
late pool, so that uracil
is incorporated into DNA, and
chromosome breaks occur (2). Vitamin B-6 is also necessary
for the synthesis of glutathione from homocysteine: glutathione
is a cofactor of glutathione S-transferases and peroxidases,
which detoxify many carcinogenic compounds and protect
against oxidative DNA damage (7–9). Riboﬂavin is the precur-
sor of ﬂavin adenine dinucleotide, a necessary cofactor for 5,10-
methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (10–13), which catalyzes
the irreversible conversion of 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate to
5-methyltetrahydrofolate, with the latter being the methyl donor
for DNA methylation (10, 11, 14, 15).

Inadequate levels of folate, vitamin B-12, vitamin B-6, and
riboﬂavin may all result in high levels of blood homocysteine (5,
16) by disrupting the pathways summarized above (17). In vitro
studies indicate that high homocysteine levels are associated
with high proliferation rates of cancer cells including breast
cancer cells (18, 19) and also with oxidative damage to cells
(20). High homocysteine levels in blood have been associated
with increased breast cancer risk in women with low folate
status (21) and also in women with high BMI, high plasma TGs,
and abnormal oxidation of low-density lipoproteins (20, 22–
26), all of which are associated with increased risk of certain
cancers including breast cancer (27, 28).

Studies on associations of plasma homocysteine (21, 29–32),
folate (29, 30, 32–34), vitamin B-12 (30, 32, 33), and vitamin
B-6 (30, 32, 33) with breast cancer risk have produced mixed
results. To our knowledge, no previous study has assessed the
effect of plasma riboﬂavin on breast cancer risk. We carried out a
case-control study, nested in the EPIC (European Prospective
Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition)8-Varese cohort, to
prospectively evaluate whether plasma levels of homocysteine,
folate, vitamin B-12, vitamin B-6, and riboﬂavin were associated
with risk of breast cancer, and risk of breast cancer subtypes
were deﬁned by expression of hormone receptors.

Methods

Study population and data collection. This was a case-control study
nested in the women participating in the EPIC-Varese cohort study,
which was part of the larger EPIC (European Investigation into Cancer
and Nutrition). We considered 6071 women deﬁned by the following
eligibility criteria: recruitment to the prospective Hormones and Diet in
the Etiology of Breast Cancer (ORDET) study in 1987–1992, recruit-
ment to EPIC-Varese in 1993–1998 (70% of women who participated in
ORDET were subsequently recruited in EPIC-Varese), and either
premenopausal or postmenopausal at the ORDET and EPIC baselines
(perimenopausal women and those with uncertain menopausal status
were excluded).

The date of entry to the present study was the EPIC recruitment date.
At EPIC baseline, after participants had given written informed consent,
detailed information was collected on reproductive and medical history,
physical activity, alcohol consumption, smoking, education, and other
socioeconomic variables by using a standardized lifestyle questionnaire.
Diet over the previous year was investigated by using a food frequency
questionnaire speciﬁcally developed to capture local dietary habits. Also
at baseline, weight, height, and blood pressure were measured, and a
30-mL fasting blood sample was collected by using standardized
procedures. The blood samples were divided into 0.5-mL aliquots of
plasma, serum, red blood cells, and buffy coat on the day of collection
and stored in liquid nitrogen at 2196°C (35).

All study participants had also been recruited to the earlier ORDET
study and at ORDET baseline had given a blood sample. The stored
plasma samples were analyzed, and the results of these analyses were
combined with those obtained from the samples collected at the EPIC
baseline, so as to obtain mean estimates that were more reliable than
those provided by a single measurement. The study protocol was
approved by the ethics committee of the Foundation National Cancer
Institute, Scientiﬁc Institute for Care and Treatment (IRCCS), (Milan, Italy).

Breast cancer cases and selection of control women. The 6071
women were followed up to 31 December 2009 (median 14.9 y) through
the Lombardy Cancer Registry, Varese Province, characterized by high
data completeness and quality. A total of 276 new breast cancer cases
were identiﬁed among the women over the follow-up period from the
registry database. Information on estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone
receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER2)
expression of the cancers was obtained from electronic pathology
reports.

For each case, one matched control was chosen, by using an incidence
density sampling protocol, from appropriate risk sets consisting of
cohort members alive and free of cancer at the time of diagnosis of the
index case. Matching criteria were age at recruitment (6 5 y), date of
recruitment (6 180 d), distance between ORDET and EPIC recruitment
(6 90 d), menopausal status (postmenopausal at both ORDET and EPIC
baseline; premenopausal at ORDET baseline, postmenopausal at EPIC
baseline; premenopausal at ORDET baseline and still premenopausal at
EPIC baseline), and micronutrient analysis in the same batch.

Analysis of plasma samples. Analyses were performed both on EPIC
and ORDET plasma samples. Folate and vitamin B-12 were determined
on a Cobas 8000 modular analyzer (Roche Diagnostic GmbH) by Roche
Elecsys electrochemoluminescence assays. Homocysteine was deter-
mined immunoenzymatically as S-adenosylhomocysteine produced
from serum homocysteine on a Siemens Dimension Vista Lab System
analyzer (Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics Products GmbH). All assays
were performed according to recommendations of the equipment
manufacturers.

Levels of riboﬂavin and vitamin B-6 (the latter as pyridoxal 5#-phosphate,
the principal active form of vitamin B-6) were measured by LC/MS by
using a Thermo Fisher LCQ Vantage mass spectrometer coupled to a
Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc Transcend HPLC system. Perchloric acid
was used to precipitate out proteins from aliquots of plasma to which
had been added appropriate internal standards (15N,13C-labeled
riboﬂavin and 2H-labeled pyridoxal 5#-phosphate). After incubation
at 50°C for 10 min, the treated aliquots were ﬁltered and injected into
the HPLC system and eluted with a water, methanol, ammonium
acetate gradient. The mass spectrometer was operated in single reac-
tion monitoring mode to minimize interference from other compounds.
Use of internal standards made it possible to correct for losses during
puriﬁcation and variation in instrument response. We excluded 17
cases and 18 controls because EPIC or ORDET plasma samples were not
available.

Statistical analysis. We calculated plasma levels of homocysteine,
folate, vitamin B-12, vitamin B-6, and riboﬂavin for each case and
control as the mean of the values from the EPIC and ORDET samples.
CV for each, considering the ORDET and EPIC samples as replicates of a
single sample were as follows: 13% for homocysteine, 16% for folate,

14% for vitamin B-12, 31% for vitamin B-6, and 23% for riboﬂavin.
Plasma levels were grouped into quartiles based on the distribution in
controls. Baseline characteristics of study participants, according to
quartiles of plasma vitamin B-6, were summarized as means and
standard deviations (continuous variables) or frequencies (categorical
variables). Unconditional
logistic regression models were used to
estimate RRs for breast cancer with 95% CIs, with the lowest quartile
as reference; the signiﬁcance of linear trends was assessed by treating
each quartile as a continuous variable in the model and performing the
Wald test. RRs were also calculated for 1-SD increments of micro-
nutrient concentration as a continuous variable. We ran a minimally
adjusted model, with the matching variables as covariates: age (contin-
uous), date of recruitment (continuous), time between ORDET and EPIC
recruitment
(continuous), and menopausal status (premenopausal/
postmenopausal in EPIC). We also ran fully adjusted models, with the
following additional covariates: family history of breast cancer in ﬁrst
degree relatives (yes, no), age at menarche (<15 or $15 y), parity
(nulliparous, 1–2 children, or >2 children), oral contraceptive use (never
or sometime), education (#8 or >8 y), smoking status (never, former, or
current), alcohol consumption (continuous), and BMI (continuous).

We analyzed all women and also analyzed postmenopausal and
premenopausal women separately. P values for interaction between
plasma micronutrient with menopausal status were estimated by adding
the product of quartile of plasma micronutrient with menopausal status
to the model and applying the Wald test. We also analyzed the risk of
developing breast cancer subtypes deﬁned by receptor status. Heteroge-
neity was investigated by the Wald test. We analyzed subgroups deﬁned
by alcohol intake (abstainers, <7 g/d, or $7 g/d) with P interaction
calculated by treating alcohol intake as a dichotomous variable (abstainer
or consumer) and multiplying this by the analyte value (continuous).
We excluded 1 case and 2 controls because confounder variables were
missing; the analyses were thus performed on 514 women, 258 cases,
and 256 controls. All statistical tests were 2-sided, and differences
were considered signiﬁcant for P < 0.05. The analyses were performed
with Stata version 11.2.

Results

Baseline characteristics of study participants by quartiles of
plasma vitamin B-6 are shown in Table 1. Women in the highest
vitamin B-6 quartile tended to have lower BMI, lower plasma
homocysteine, and higher levels of other B vitamins. They were
also better educated and less likely to be smokers, to have used
oral contraceptives, and to have a family history of breast
cancer. Table 2 shows the RRs of developing breast cancer by
quartiles of plasma homocysteine and B vitamins for all study
women. High levels of vitamin B-6 in the continuous model were
associated with decreased breast cancer risk [RR: 0.78; 95% CI:
0.63, 0.96 (fully adjusted model)]; however, no reduction in risk
was found in the analysis based on quartiles. None of the other
micronutrients was signiﬁcantly associated with risk (P trend $
0.31).

Table 3 shows risk estimates by menopausal status at
baseline. Among postmenopausal women, none of the micro-
nutrients was signiﬁcantly associated with breast cancer risk
(P trend $ 0.29). Among premenopausal women, high levels of
vitamin B-6 were associated with signiﬁcantly lowered breast
cancer risk in the continuous model (RR: 0.66; 95% CI: 0.48,
0.92); however, no reduction in risk was found in the analysis
based on quartiles. The highest quartile of plasma riboﬂavin
(compared with the lowest) was also associated with signiﬁcantly
lowered breast cancer risk [RR: 0.45; 95% CI: 0.21, 0.94,
P trend = 0.021 (fully adjusted model)]; there was a signiﬁcant
interaction between menopausal status and plasma riboﬂavin
(P = 0.021). Levels of homocysteine and the other B vitamins
were not signiﬁcantly associated with premenopausal breast

cancer risk (P trend $ 0.22). However, risk in the third quartile
of vitamin B-12 concentration was signiﬁcantly lower than
reference (RR: 0.41; 95% CI: 0.19, 0.92). No interaction was
found between menopausal status and plasma levels of homo-
cysteine (P = 0.44), folate (P = 0.46), vitamin B-12 (P = 0.45),
or vitamin B-6 (P = 0.42).

Associations of plasma homocysteine and B vitamins with
breast cancer subtypes deﬁned by hormonal receptor status are
shown in Supplemental Tables 1–3. The second quartile of
plasma homocysteine was associated with signiﬁcantly de-
creased risk of ER+ disease (RR: 0.54; 95% CI: 0.31, 0.96)
compared with the lowest. Signiﬁcant heterogeneity depending
on ER status was found for plasma folate (P heterogeneity
0.045); however, no signiﬁcant association of folate with either
ER+ (P trend = 0.13) or ER2 (P trend = 0.24) disease was found.
Signiﬁcant heterogeneity depending on ER status was found for
B-12 in the continuous model (P heterogeneity = 0.032); again,
however, no signiﬁcant association was found with either ER+ or
ER2 disease. High vitamin B-6 was associated with lowered risk
(borderline signiﬁcance) of ER+ disease in the continuous model
(RR: 0.79; 95% CI: 0.63, 1.00) (Supplemental Table 1). Vitamin
B-6 in the continuous model was associated with a signiﬁcantly
lowered risk of PR+ disease (RR: 0.72; 95% CI: 0.55, 0.95). The
second quartile of plasma homocysteine was associated with a
signiﬁcantly lowered (by 49%) risk of PR+ disease, and the
second quartile of vitamin B-12 was associated with a signiﬁ-
cantly decreased (by 61%) risk of PR2 disease compared with
the ﬁrst quartile. No signiﬁcant heterogeneity in relation to PR
status was found (P $ 0.22) (Supplemental Table 2). None of the
micronutrients analyzed was associated with the risk of devel-
oping either HER2+ (P trend $ 0.07) or HER22 (P trend $
0.30) disease, and no signiﬁcant heterogeneity in relation to
HER2 status was found (P $ 0.09) (Supplemental Table 3).

When the analyses were stratiﬁed by alcohol intake, plasma
vitamin B-12 was associated with signiﬁcantly increased breast
cancer risk among abstainers (RR: 4.88; 95% CI: 1.16, 20.55 for
the highest compared with the lowest quartile); however, few
cases were available for this subanalysis; P for interaction
between plasma vitamin B-12 and alcohol intake was not
signiﬁcant. High vitamin B-6 was associated with a signiﬁcantly
lowered breast cancer risk among women who drank >7 g/d of
alcohol (RR: 0.71; 95% CI: 0.51, 0.99 in the continuous model);
no association was found for abstainers or women who drank
#7 g/d of alcohol. P for interaction between plasma vitamin B-6
and alcohol intake was not signiﬁcant (P = 0.87) (data not
shown).

Discussion

In this nested case-control study, considering all women, breast
cancer risk decreased with increasing plasma vitamin B-6 levels.
None of the other micronutrients was associated with breast
cancer risk overall. However, when women were separated by
menopausal status, high vitamin B-6 and riboﬂavin were
associated with signiﬁcantly decreased breast cancer risk among
premenopausal women. Although plasma folate and vitamin
B-12 were not signiﬁcantly associated with the risk of breast cancer
subtype deﬁned by ER status, there was signiﬁcant heterogene-
ity, with a nonsigniﬁcantly decreased risk of ER+ disease for high
folate and vitamin B-12 and nonsigniﬁcantly increased risk
of ER2 disease for high folate and vitamin B-12. For increasing
levels of vitamin B-6, the risks of ER+ and PR+ breast cancer
decreased signiﬁcantly, but heterogeneity between receptor-positive

and -negative status was not signiﬁcant. Finally,
increasing
vitamin B-6 was associated with decreasing breast cancer risk
among women who drank >7 g/d of alcohol compared with
those who drank less or abstained.

Previous studies on associations of plasma levels of nutrients
involved in one-carbon metabolism with breast cancer risk
focused mainly on homocysteine and folate. Of 5 studies
concerned with homocysteine, 2 found no association (30, 32),
2 case-control studies found that higher homocysteine levels
were associated with increased breast cancer risk (29, 31), and a
case-control study nested in the WomenÕs Health Study found
that homocysteine levels were not associated with overall breast
cancer risk, but among women with low folate status, the risk
was increased if homocysteine was high (21). We found no
evidence that homocysteine inﬂuenced breast cancer risk.

Our ﬁnding of a null association between plasma folate and
breast cancer risk is in agreement with a nested case-control
study in the Washington County serum bank (30), a case-control
study conducted in Taiwan (29), and a case-control study on
postmenopausal women nested in the Malmo¨ Diet and Cancer
cohort (34). Other studies found a decreased breast cancer risk
for increasing blood folate levels (36, 37), especially in women
whose alcohol intake was high ($15 g/d) (32). Finally, a case-
control study nested in the WomenÕs Health Study found no

association of folate with overall breast cancer risk but deter-
mined that high folate was unexpectedly associated with
increased risks of premenopausal, ER-positive, and PR-positive
breast cancer (33).

To our knowledge, only 3 studies have investigated plasma
vitamin B-12 and breast cancer risk. One found no associa-
tion (33), as did our study; another found that for high B-12,
risks of overall and premenopausal breast cancer decreased (32);
and the other found that risks decreased, especially among
women who were postmenopausal at recruitment (30).

Our ﬁnding that high vitamin B-6 was associated with
signiﬁcantly lowered overall breast cancer risk is not completely
in line with the results of the nested case-control study of
Zhang et al. (32), which found that among postmenopausal
women the association was of borderline signiﬁcance but was
substantial among women who drank less than 15 g/d of
alcohol. Lurie et al. (38) also found that postmenopausal women
with high vitamin B-6 had lowered breast cancer risk, which
appeared limited to women with ER+, PR+, and ER+PR+
cancers. Finally, 2 nested case-control studies found no associ-
ation between plasma vitamin B-6 and overall breast cancer
risk (30, 33).

Our ﬁnding that breast cancer risk was signiﬁcantly lowered
among premenopausal women with high compared with low

plasma riboﬂavin appears unique, because we are aware of no
other study to investigate riboﬂavin/breast cancer associations.
The fact that the association was conﬁned to premenopausal
women is unexpected—but not too unexpected, given the
numerous differences in terms of risk factors, prognosis, and
molecular biology between breast cancer in pre- and postmen-
opausal women; it suggests the need for further research.

Vitamin B-6 and riboﬂavin may lower breast cancer risk
through mechanisms other than one-carbon metabolism, be-
cause they are essential cofactors in numerous reactions central
to human metabolism (39, 40). In addition, vitamin B-6 has been
shown to decrease oxidative stress, cell proliferation, and
angiogenesis and to enhance immune function (39, 41), whereas
low vitamin B-6 concentrations have been associated with high
levels of inﬂammatory markers (42). Certain carcinogens are
metabolized by ﬂavin-dependent enzymes, and the resulting
metabolites may have either increased or decreased carcinoge-
nicity (43). Some studies [reviewed by Powers (44)] suggest
that the risk of certain cancers is increased when riboﬂavin is
deﬁcient.

Furthermore, both riboﬂavin and vitamin B-6 are cofactors in
the pathway by which tryptophan is degraded to kynurenines,
and many products of this pathway are neuroactive compounds
with immunomodulatory effects (45). The same pathway is
stimulated by inﬂammatory molecules and is often systemati-
cally up-regulated during an active immune response (45, 46).
Because inﬂammation has been linked to increased overall
and premenopausal breast cancer risk (47, 48), vitamin B-6

and riboﬂavin status might be linked to breast cancer risk
by inﬂammation-related mechanisms, perhaps involving the
kynurenine pathway. However, few other data are available
to suggest mechanisms by which low riboﬂavin status can
increase the risk of breast cancer—an association we found in
premenopausal women.

Study strengths include prospective design that rendered
reverse causation unlikely as an explanation for the associations
found; the availability of detailed information on lifestyle,
dietary, and anthropometric variables, which made it to possi-
ble to control for potential confounders; and the availability
of 2 plasma samples taken ;5 y apart, which made it possi-
ble to analyze plasma micronutrient levels twice, providing
estimates that are likely to be more reliable than a single
measurement. A possible study limitation is that samples were
collected, stored at 2196°C (EPIC samples) or 280°C (ORDET
samples), and analyzed up to 25 y later. There may have been
differential decay of the analytes over that period. However,
unless analyte decay varied with initial concentration (which
seems unlikely), this will not bias analyte-risk associations. A
stability study conducted on vitamin B-6, vitamin B-12, and folic
acid in plasma with EDTA and riboﬂavin in whole blood found
that no large decline had occurred after 4 y of storage at 220°C
(49). Moreover, the small number of breast cancers diagnosed
will have decreased the power to detect associations, especially in
subgroup analyses. Another limitation is that we performed mul-
tiple statistical comparisons that were not corrected for, thereby
increasing the risk of erroneously rejecting null hypotheses.

Finally, few data are available on biologic mechanisms that could
explain associations between low vitamin B-6 and riboﬂavin status
and increased breast cancer risk, especially among premenopausal
women.

To conclude, the ﬁndings of this case-control study nested in
the EPIC-Varese cohort suggest that high plasma concentrations
of vitamin B-6 may decrease the risk of breast cancer and
particularly of ER+ breast cancer and may also lower the risk in
moderate-to-heavy drinkers (>7 g/d alcohol). High plasma levels
of riboﬂavin may decrease the risk of breast cancer in premen-
opausal but not postmenopausal women. Homocysteine and the
other B vitamins investigated do not seem to inﬂuence breast
cancer risk. Further research is required to elucidate the
mechanisms by which B vitamins can inﬂuence the etiology of
breast cancer.

ABSTRACT Mouse genetic models that probe important pathways in intestinal cell maturation, such as cell-cycle
regulation, apoptosis, and, especially, lineage speciﬁc differentiation, have provided profound insight into the
underlying mechanisms of intestinal tumor formation and progression. However, a wealth of epidemiological and
experimental data indicates that environment, especially the diet, is a principal determinant of relative risk for tumor
development. We have demonstrated that even in mouse models in which tumor incidence is strongly initiated by
genetic manipulation of genes, such as Apc, p21WAF1/cip1, and p27Kip1, a Western-style diet that is high in fat and
low in calcium and vitamin D can dramatically increase and accelerate tumor formation. Moreover, experiments
show that modulation of calcium and vitamin D levels can substantially inﬂuence tumor formation in both the mouse
genetic models, as well as in a new dietary model that appears to mimic the development of sporadic colon cancer.
Finally, analysis of gene expression proﬁles provides important insights into how diets may alter metabolic proﬁles
and regulatory pathways that inﬂuence probability of tumor formation in the histologically and physiologically
normal intestinal mucosa.

KEY WORDS:

● Western-style diet ● gene expression ● colon cancer

Epidemiological studies have identiﬁed diet as a major
variable that accounts for organ-site speciﬁc differences in
incidence of cancer in patient populations in different coun-
tries and geographical areas. For colon cancer, these differ-
ences in incidence are profound. Moreover, there are several
examples of migrant populations that clearly link these differ-
ences in incidence to environmental factors. For example,
native Japanese historically had a relatively low incidence of
colon cancer relative to stomach cancer. Upon migration to
the Hawaiian Islands, within one generation, this relative
incidence begins to shift, and, within 2 generations, the inci-
dence of colon cancer is nearly equivalent to the high rate of

the U.S. white population. Thus, within 2 generations, there
is almost an order of magnitude shift in the relative incidence
of colon cancer. Two generations is far too short a time for the
genetics of the population to have shifted signiﬁcantly, clearly
demonstrating that environmental factors—most likely diet—
account for this dramatic change. Conﬁrmation of this is the
fact that as the citizens of Japan have adopted a more Western-
style diet, their incidence of colon cancer has begun to in-
crease relative to the historically lower levels. To put this in a
practical context, such data indicate that it is theoretically
possible to reduce colon cancer incidence by at least 50%, and
possibly closer to 90%, by shifts in diet. If this could be
realized, this would be an astounding advance in preventing
this major disease.

There is a wealth of data from rodent model systems, both
chemically, as well as genetically induced intestinal cancer,
that demonstrate the profound inﬂuence of diet on cancer
initiation and progression. There is still, however, a reluctance
on the part of most molecular and cell biologists to accept this
as fundamental to the process of tumorigenesis. We believe
there are 2 reasons for this. First, there is a fundamental
misconception that diet may only play a role in establishing
risk for tumor formation in those without genetic predisposi-
tion. However, there are both population data and experimen-
tal data that indicate this is not correct. For example, hered-
itary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer is an inherited syndrome
that imposes a very high risk for development of intestinal

cancer in affected families. However, it is instructive to note
that in the original studies of this familial cancer syndrome by
Warthin in the early 1900s, cancer family “G” had a high
incidence of gastric cancer, which was also the principle
sporadic gastrointestinal cancer in the United States at that
time (1). By mid-century, when family “G” was revisited by
Lynch, gastrointestinal cancer in this family was still high but
had shifted in site to colon cancer, which had replaced gastric
cancer as the principle site of sporadic intestinal cancer (2).
Thus, the genetics of the family (i.e., inheritance of a mutant
gene involved in DNA mismatch repair) dictated high cancer
incidence, but the environment (i.e., diet) was responsible for
dictating site speciﬁcity. We will also present data that dem-
onstrate that in every mouse genetic model in which intestinal
cancer is initiated at a very high frequency by inherited ge-
netic mutations, dietary factors still exert a profound effect on
tumor frequency and size, and, in some cases, site of formation.
Therefore, even when high incidence is dictated by genetic
factors, dietary effects can be manifest in terms of modulation
of tumor frequency or size. In terms of clinical management,
there are high-genetic-risk individuals for whom this may not
be relevant. For example, in patients with familial adenoma-
tous polyposis who develop hundreds of polyps, dietary alter-
ations may decrease this number signiﬁcantly, but even a 50%
decrease in polyp number would not dictate changes in clinical
care. However, this does not alter the fact that diet can play a
profound role in the penetrance of the disease on a per tumor
basis.

The second reason for the lack of attention among molec-
ular biologists to the importance of diet is the difﬁculty in
attributing dietary alterations in probability of tumor forma-
tion to speciﬁc biochemical and molecular alterations. Con-
sider that for the ⬃90% of colon cancers diagnosed in the
United States termed sporadic colon cancer, the elevation of
the probability of tumor formation by dietary factors may
involve subtle affects on the intestinal mucosa that are inte-
grated over 6 to 7 decades of life. During this time, there are
⬃1012 cell divisions in the mucosa and even under the inﬂu-
ence of diets that elevate risk signiﬁcantly, generally a single
tumor forms. During this period of over 6 decades, the intes-
tinal mucosa essentially functions normally and exhibits no
pathology. We are therefore faced with the fact that there are
very subtle shifts in physiology and metabolism that may
increase the probability of only 1 of 1012 cell divisions under-
going a change leading to neoplasia. Further, altered cells must
also be retained in the mucosa, rather than being sloughed
into the lumen, or undergoing apoptosis or anoikis. It is
therefore difﬁcult to design experiments to identify alterations
that may be of signiﬁcance. As regards to this, K. Yang, H.
Newmark, and M. Lipkin (Strang Cancer Prevention Center;
unpublished results) have developed a new model of rodent
colon cancer modulated by diet that we believe mimics the
generation of human sporadic intestinal cancer. We will dis-
cuss data on altered pathways that may perturb intestinal
homeostasis in this model and thus establish an increased
probability of tumor formation.

Dietary interaction with genetic factors in intestinal tumor
formation

investigate the interaction of dietary and genetic factors in the

mouse (see Table 1). The original WD was formulated by
Newmark and Lipkin to mimic major risk factors for intestinal
cancer in developed countries, particularly in the United
States (3–5). This diet is high in fat and low in calcium and
vitamin D. It is important to note that these levels are within
the normal range of these components in the U.S. diet. Thus,
based on nutrient density, the levels of calcium and vitamin D
are at the low end of the normal range but are not “deﬁcient”
diets that raise other overt health problems for the mice or for
individuals who consume such diets. The second WD we use
(new Western Diet; NWD) has these same high levels of fat
and low calcium and vitamin D, but also incorporates lower
levels of ﬁber and compounds that contribute to the single
carbon, “methyl donor” pool: folate, methionine, and choline
(6). Lower intakes of these nutrients have each been linked to
higher risk of colon cancer in the U.S. population.

It has been demonstrated that the WD is effective in
increasing tumor formation in Apc1638⫾ mice that inherit an
inactive Apc allele (7). We have reported that additional
inactivation of the gene that encodes the cyclin-dependent
(cdki) p21WAF1/cip1 gene in the same
kinase inhibitor
Apc1638N mice is effective in increasing incidence, multiplic-
ity, and size of intestinal tumors (8). Furthermore, despite the
high initiation and progression of tumors caused by these
genetic factors, maintaining the mice on the WD increased
tumor frequency and volume signiﬁcantly for every p21 geno-
type (p21⫹/⫹,⫹/⫺, or ⫺/⫺) and was additive to the effect of
genotype (8). Moreover, this led to a marked decrease in
animal life span, independent of p21 genotype, compared with
mice fed the control, AIN76A diet (8).

More recently, we have turned our attention to another
cdki, termed p27Kip1. While it had been reported that inacti-
vation of p27 in mice that harbor a mutant Apc allele was
effective in enhancing tumor formation (9), we, in fact, found
that inactivation of p27 alone was sufﬁcient to cause intestinal
tumor formation in mice (10). We have subsequently found
that this is strictly a function of diet: on a standard laboratory
diet, used by most investigators, no tumors form in mice that
are p27⫹/⫹, and very few tumors form in p27⫾ or ⫺/⫺ mice.
However, when fed a deﬁned AIN76A diet, tumor formation
is signiﬁcant for these latter 2 genotypes and increases even
further in the same animals fed the WD (W. C. Yang, K.
Bancroft, and L. Augenlicht, Albert Einstein Cancer Center;
unpublished results). The lack of tumor formation in the
animals fed the diet may be due to inhibitory phytochemicals
in this plant-based diet. Alternatively, the AIN76A diet,
designed to maximize growth of the mice, may be considered
a tumor promoting diet. In either case, the profound affect of

2712

dietary factors on tumor formation is apparent. Moreover, not
only do Apc⫾, p27⫾ or ⫺/⫺ mice on the AIN76A and WD diet
form tumors but they also exhibit intussusception, a pathology
seen in patients with intestinal tumors, but not reported in
mouse models (W. C. Yang, K. Bancroft, and L. Augenlicht,
Albert Einstein Cancer Center; unpublished results). Finally,
in every mouse model of intestinal cancer that we or our
collaborators have investigated, including models involving
defects in mismatch repair alone or coupled with inherited Apc
mutations, the WD increased tumor formation and generally
produced more tumors in the large intestine (K. Yang and M.
Lipkin, Strang Cancer Prevention Center; unpublished re-
sults). Therefore, it is clear that it is necessary to consider
dietary factors to accurately model human intestinal cancer, as
well as to maximize tumor formation in such models.

A new mouse model of sporadic colon cancer

Newmark et al. (6) reported that the NWD was capable of
causing preneoplastic, as well as some neoplastic lesions, when
fed to wild-type mice for more than 1 y. This has been studied
further by them in an experimental design in which C57Bl/6J
control mice were maintained, upon weaning, on either an
AIN76A diet or the NWD diet. Moreover, since supplemen-
tation of the WD with calcium and vitamin D had been shown
to reverse the increased tumor formation stimulated by the
WD in Apc1638⫾, ApcMin/⫹, and Apc⫾,Mlh1⫾ mice (K. Yang,
Strang Cancer Prevention Center; W. Edelmann, Albert Ein-
stein College of Medicine; R. Kucherlapati, Harvard Medical
School; and M. Lipkin, Strang Cancer Prevention Center;
unpublished results), a mouse group that was fed the NWD
supplemented with calcium and vitamin D was also included.
After 2 y on the NWD, mice developed a signiﬁcant number
of colon and small intestinal tumors (both adenomas and
adenocarcinomas), which was not seen when the NWD was
supplemented with calcium and vitamin D (K. Yang and M.
Lipkin, Strang Cancer Prevention Center; unpublished re-
sults). The incidence and the number of colon tumors, kinetics
of tumor development (i.e., at about 80% of the life span of
the organism), and dependence of tumor formation on major
risk factors for colon cancer in the Western diet are all
remarkably similar to the development of sporadic colon can-
cer in the human population.

In the same experiment, mice from each dietary group were
euthanized at 3 mo for analysis of molecular changes in colon
epithelial cells that might predispose the animals for develop-
ment of pathological changes at the later time points. This
time point was chosen because it was sufﬁcient for the diets to
have inﬂuenced metabolism and physiology that establish a
relative risk for tumor development but early enough so that
small tumors and microadenomas that presage tumor develop-
ment at 18 –24 mo would not yet be a complicating factor in
analysis.

In comparing colonic RNA from animals maintained on
the NWD to those fed the control AIN76A diet, about 15%
of 28,000 sequences were altered in expression. This altered
proﬁle of gene expression in the colon induced by the NWD
compared with the AIN76A diet was partially shifted back by
supplementation of the NWD with calcium and vitamin D
toward the proﬁle of expression seen in the control diet. In
fact, we were able to identify over 700 sequences altered in
expression by the NWD that were signiﬁcantly shifted back by
addition of calcium and vitamin D toward their expression
levels in the AIN76A fed animals. Thus, there is a subset of
sequences that closely track the levels of calcium and vitamin

D in the diet, as well as the relative risk for tumor develop-
ment.

Grouping these sequences into functionally related catego-
ries revealed signiﬁcant enrichment among sequences altered
in expression for genes involved in 36 of 133 predeﬁned
functional groups. For example, the proﬁle of expression of
genes involved in lipid metabolism was altered by the NWD,
consistent with the elevated fat content of this diet. Remark-
ably, elevation of calcium and vitamin D in the NWD par-
tially restored the pattern of expression of these genes to that
seen in the control diet, even though no change was made to
the lipid content of the diet. Thus, calcium and vitamin D
appear to normalize the metabolic proﬁle of the cells with
regard to lipid metabolism. There were also extensive changes
in expression of genes associated with calcium homeostasis,
again consistent with the differences in calcium levels in the
different diets.

One of the most interesting set of changes involved genes
involved in Wnt signaling, the pathway that is at the center of
initiating colon tumor formation in both the human and in
the mouse genetic models. Wnt signaling is a developmental
pathway that, when activated in the intestinal tract, favors the
dissociation of ␤-catenin from E-cadherin in the membrane
and therefore the association of ␤-catenin with Tcf4, a mem-
ber of a family of transcription factors (11,12). This forms an
active transcription complex that initiates a program of altered
gene expression. This program has been shown to be associ-
ated with the regulation of genes involved in cell cycling, such
as c-myc and cyclin D1, as well as cell differentiation (13–15).
In fact, it has been demonstrated that Wnt signaling maintains
cells in a “crypt progenitor” like phenotype (14) and that in
the constitutive absence of this signaling, when cells are forced
to express a dominant-negative Tcf4 or in mice with a targeted
inactivation of Tcf4, the stem-cell population differentiates,
and the mucosa degenerates (16).

In colon cancer, ␤-catenin-Tcf signaling becomes consti-
tutive. A key regulatory element in the Wnt pathway is the
APC gene product. This protein forms a complex with ␤-cate-
nin, axin, and GSK3␤to target ␤-catenin for phosphorylation,
and subsequent ubiquitination and proteosomal degradation
(11,15,17). Thus, ␤-catenin-Tcf signaling is regulated in part
by the APC gene product. In the development of colon
cancer, APC (or less frequently, ␤-catenin itself) is mutated,
either in the germ line or somatically, and this regulatory step
is therefore abrogated (11,15,17). Thus, ␤-catenin-Tcf signal-
ing becomes constitutively activated, leading to cell cycling
and persistence of cells in a crypt progenitor-like phenotype
(i.e., undifferentiated or partially differentiated), and eventu-
ally, causing tumor formation.

When mice were fed the NWD, there was an elevation of
expression of ␤-catenin gene expression. Thus, cells may have
been driven toward a more proliferative, less differentiated
state. However, when mice were fed the NWD diet supple-
mented with calcium and vitamin D, the level of expression of
the ␤-catenin gene decreased, reestablishing a measure of
regulation of the pathway. Further, when mice were fed the
NWD, there was increased expression of genes that encode
receptors for Wnt signals, which decreased when the NWD
was supplemented by calcium and vitamin D. Therefore, there
may be subtle changes in how the pathway responds to Wnt
ligands and hence in homeostasis of the intestinal mucosa. In
summary, diet appeared to modulate the key pathway that
leads to colon tumor formation. Moreover, this could be re-
lated to extensive changes in both the redox and the cytoskel-
eton functional groups. It has recently been demonstrated that
␤-catenin also regulates an oxidative stress pathway, which

results in decreased cell proliferation (18,19). Therefore,
␤-catenin regulated pathways may interact as positive and
negative modulators of cell cycling to maintain homeostasis of
the intestinal mucosa. As is clear from the development of
tumors in animals maintained on the Western-style diet [in-
terestingly, originally termed a “stress diet” by Newmark and
Lipkin (3,7)], this drive to maintain homeostasis eventually
fails, at least in some crypts, perhaps because of an imbalance
in these pathways generated by the complexity of changes in
both Wnt signaling and in redox functions. This may be
reﬂected in alterations in expression of genes involved in
cell-cycle progression. Finally, extensive changes in genes that
encode proteins linked to cytoskeleton structure and function
could also stem from the alterations in Wnt signaling, because
their normal binding partners in the membrane, the cadherins,
connect to the cytoskeleton (20). This may be of signiﬁcance
in neoplastic transformation because cell shape changes may
affect cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions and signaling, and
such changes in the cytoskeletal network have long been
recognized as a hallmark of cancer.

Pathways of maturation in the intestinal tract

As discussed above, dietary modulation of the probability of
tumor development would be expected to affect pathways that
govern normal cell maturation. These would include pathways
that regulate and coordinate cell proliferation, cell migration,
apoptosis/anoikis, and lineage-speciﬁc differentiation. There is
certainly much information available regarding the role of key
molecules in these maturation pathways, both in general and
speciﬁcally for intestinal epithelial cells. To expand our
knowledge of how cells mature during their migration from the
crypt to the lumen, we have adapted the Weiser technique
(21,22) to the mouse to fractionate cells according to their
position within this continuum. This method involves pro-
gressive dissociation of cells from the small intestine, begin-
ning from the top of the villus (fraction 1) and proceeding
down to the crypt (fraction 10). We have validated the frac-
tionation in several ways (23): the expression of differentia-
tion markers, such as villin and alkaline phosphatase, increase
as a gradient from fraction 10 (bottom) to fraction 1 (top), and
PCNA, a marker of proliferating cells, decreases along this
axis, and is undetectable by approximately fraction 5. We have
also done gene expression proﬁling of these fractions. This
further validated the fractionation, as other differentiation
markers also increased as cells migrated upward, and there was
a good relation between sequences that changed in expression
as cells migrated up from the crypt and sequences we had
previously identiﬁed during the cell-cycle arrest and differen-
tiation along the absorptive cell lineage of Caco2 cells in
culture (24). Moreover, several sequences characteristically
expressed in Paneth cells, which migrate down into the crypt
base, were maximally expressed in the crypt fractions, as were
a large number of cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases, which
drive the cells through the cell cycle. We have now compared
the database of sequences altered in expression by the NWD
diet to other gene expression databases we have generated
(www.augenlichtlab.com). We found that a signiﬁcant per-
centage of sequences altered in expression by diet are se-
quences that also change in expression during migration of the
cells along the crypt-lumen axis (G. Corner and L. Augen-
licht, Albert Einstein Cancer Center; unpublished results).
This is further evidence that the diets are likely altering
homeostasis in the intestinal mucosa, at the molecular as well
as the cellular level.

A key role of c-myc and p21WAF1/cip1

A particularly interesting pathway that governs cell matu-
ration and which is regulated by Wnt signaling, encompasses
the c-myc and the p21WAF1/cip1 gene, a cyclin-dependent ki-
nase inhibitor. As discussed, c-myc is a target of ␤-catenin-
Tcf4 transcriptional regulation (25), and, in the lower portion
of the crypt where ␤-catenin-Tcf4 signaling is highest, expres-
sion of c-myc is also high. Moreover, we have shown that
c-myc decreases as cells migrate up the crypt, and coincident
with this is an altered regulation of a large number of genes
that have been shown to be c-myc targets (23). Thus, we
believe that c-myc is a major element in stimulating the
cascade of events that govern normal intestinal cell matura-
tion. Further, p21 is one of the important genes that c-myc
regulates in this cascade. The expression of p21 is repressed by
c-myc forming a complex with a positive regulator of p21,
Miz-1. Upon decreased expression of c-myc, Miz-1 becomes
free to bind to and activate the promoter of p21, thus elevating
p21 expression (14). In investigating the relative levels of
c-myc and p21 mRNA expression along the crypt-lumen axis,
we found that c-myc progressively decreases from fraction 10
(crypt) to fraction 1 (top), while p21 levels are not elevated
until the cells clearly exit the crypt (23). Thus, the ratio of p21
to c-myc mRNA increases “stepwise” along this axis: due to
the drop in c-myc, the p21/c-myc ratio is elevated as cells
migrate up the crypt. This plateaus immediately until cells are
in the villus. Then, as p21 is elevated, there is a further
increase in the p21/c-myc ratio nearer the top of the crypt.

This pattern needs to be conﬁrmed at the protein level and
by more careful positioning of the changes along the crypt-
villus axis. However, it may indicate an integration of the cell
maturation inducing affects of c-myc and p21 along this axis,
coordinated by the stoichiometry of the components. This
may be critical, because, as discussed above, inactivation of
p21 can increase tumor formation initiated by inactivation of
Apc. Interestingly, the fact that inactivation of p21 is not
sufﬁcient for tumor formation [i.e., in the intestine, inactiva-
tion of p21 also required a mutation of Apc for tumor forma-
tion (8)] may be because p21 is not normally expressed in
either the stem-cell or the transit-cell population in the crypt
but only as cells have migrated into the villus. In this context,
it is interesting to note that we have recently detected that for
the cdki p27, there may be higher expression in the crypt
where it complexes with cdks (H. Smartt and L. Augenlicht,
Albert Einstein Cancer Center; unpublished results). This
raises the hypothesis that p27 in proliferating crypt cells,
functions, at least in part, to restrain cycling cells from un-
controlled growth. Thus, it would then be clear why targeted
inactivation of p27 is sufﬁcient to initiate tumor formation
(10).

Summary

The development of intestinal cancer, whether in well-
deﬁned, high-risk groups, in the general population or in
mouse models is highly dependent upon dietary exposures.
Although dietary factors inﬂuence the probability of tumor
formation, they may exert only subtle affects on the trillions of
cells that reside over a lifetime in the intestinal mucosa, only
a very small number of which, even in groups at higher risk,
will develop into neoplastic lesions. While pathways inﬂu-
enced by diet may produce phenotypically undetectable le-
sions at early stages of carcinogenesis, the techniques described
herein provide unique mechanistic insights into the identiﬁ-
cation of diet-related gene expression patterns associated with

higher risk of colorectal cancer. There is great potential to use
these models to support the biologic plausibility for dietary
prevention of colorectal cancer and for the identiﬁcation of
new or novel protective dietary factors.

Abstract

Background: Dietary energy density (ED) is a measure of diet quality that estimates the amount of energy per unit of food

(kilocalories per gram) consumed. Low-ED diets are generally high in ﬁber and fruits and vegetables and low in fat. Dietary

ED has been positively associated with body mass index (BMI) and other risk factors for postmenopausal breast cancer.

Objective: We evaluated the associations of total dietary ED and energy-dense (high-ED) foods with postmenopausal

breast cancer incidence.

Methods: Analyses included 56,795 postmenopausal women from the Cancer Prevention Study II Nutrition Cohort with

no previous history of breast or other cancers and who provided information on diet, lifestyle, and medical history in 1999.

Multivariable-adjusted breast cancer incidence rate ratios (RRs and 95% CIs) were estimated for quintiles of total dietary

ED and for the consumption of high-ED foods in Cox proportional hazards regression models.

Results: During a median follow-up of 11.7 y, 2509 invasive breast cancer cases were identiﬁed, including 1857 estrogen

receptor-positive and 277 estrogen receptor-negative tumors. Median dietary ED was 1.5 kcal/g (IQR: 1.3–1.7 kcal/g). After

adjusting for age, race, education, reproductive characteristics, and family history, high compared with low dietary ED was

associated with a statistically signiﬁcantly higher risk of breast cancer (RR for ﬁfth quintile compared with ﬁrst quintile: 1.20;
95% CI: 1.05, 1.36; P-trend = 0.03). The association between the amount of high-ED foods consumed and breast cancer risk

was not statistically signiﬁcant. We observed no differences by estrogen receptor status or effect modiﬁcation by BMI, age,

or physical activity.

Conclusion: These results suggest a modest positive association between total dietary ED and risk of postmenopausal
breast cancer. J Nutr 2016;146:2045–50.

Introduction

Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer among
American women. By the end of 2016, there will be ;245,000
incident invasive cases diagnosed, and ;40,000 women will die
from breast cancer (1). Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease.
For example, differences in risk factors, clinical characteristics,
responses to treatments, and prognoses have been observed among
subtypes determined by the estrogen receptor (ER)5 (2–4). Among
prospective cohort studies, tumors that express the ER (;70–80%

ER+) have been more strongly associated with hormone-related
inﬂuences than ER2 tumors (;20–30% ER2) (4–6).

Established risk factors for postmenopausal breast cancer
include reproductive characteristics, hormonal therapies con-
taining estrogen and progestin, alcohol consumption, and
factors related to energy balance, including physical activity,
obesity, and adult weight gain (7). For dietary components, such
as dietary ﬁber and total fat, the World Cancer Research Fund
(WCRF)/American Institute for Cancer Research (AICR) (8, 9)
concluded that there was no convincing evidence for associa-
tions with breast cancer incidence and mortality. Nevertheless,
diet continues to be an active area of research, with more studies
focusing on overall dietary patterns and considering whether
risks may differ by other attributes (e.g., ER status or other
tumor characteristics) (10–16).

diet quality that estimates the amount of energy per unit of food

(kilocalories per gram) consumed. ED can be calculated for
individual foods, meals, and total diet (17). A low-ED diet
pattern is generally high in fruits and vegetables and ﬁber and
low in fat (large weight with less energy contribution) (17). We
recently reported that dietary ED was positively associated with
measures of body fat and established obesity-related markers for
cancer in a cross-sectional, nationally representative sample of
US adults (18). These ﬁndings support WCRF/AICRÕs judgment
that consuming high-ED food increases, whereas low-ED
decreases, the risk of weight gain, overweight, and obesity and
thereby might be associated with cancer risk (8). On average,
individuals consume a similar weight of food daily; thus,
replacing high-ED foods with low-ED foods should encourage
weight control and could ultimately reduce the risk of weight-
related cancers later in life (19–21). Other aspects of a high-ED
diet pattern may also inﬂuence cancer risk. For example, ED was
positively associated with measures of breast density among
young women independent of weight status (22). This may be
very important because women with a high breast density have a
4–6-fold increase in breast cancer risk (23).

No prospective study, to our knowledge, has evaluated the
association between consuming energy-dense foods and breast
cancer risk. Moreover, no study, to our knowledge, has evaluated
the association between total dietary ED, perhaps a better indicator
of overall diet quality than the frequency of consuming energy-dense
foods, and breast cancer. Our primary objective was to examine
associations of total dietary ED and high-ED foods with invasive
breast cancer incidence. Because BMI is positively associated with
postmenopausal cancer risk and could potentially be on the causal
pathway between a high-ED dietary pattern and risk, we also
explored whether BMI explains or modiﬁes a potential association
between ED and breast cancer risk. Last, we also assessed whether
associations differed by age, physical activity, and ER status.

Methods

Cohort description. Women in this study were drawn from the CPS-II
(Cancer Prevention Study II) Nutrition Cohort, a prospective study of
cancer incidence and mortality that was established by the American
Cancer Society in 1992 and includes ;98,000 women (24). The nutrition
cohort is a subset of the larger CPS-II mortality study initiated by the
American Cancer Society in 1982. Participants in the nutrition cohort
were recruited from 21 states and were aged 50–74 y at enrollment when
they completed a survey on demographic, medical, dietary, and lifestyle
characteristics. All living members have received follow-up question-
naires every 2 y since 1997 to update exposure information and to
ascertain newly diagnosed cancers. All aspects of the CPS-II Nutrition
Cohort have been reviewed and approved by the Emory University
Institutional Review Board.

Follow-up for this analysis began in 1999 when participants completed
and returned a comprehensive FFQ (24–26) and was calculated from the
date of receipt of this FFQ until the date of invasive breast cancer
diagnosis, death, or until June 30, 2011, whichever came ﬁrst. Of the
73,640 CPS-II Nutrition Cohort participants who completed the 1999
FFQ, 1744 were lost to follow-up, and exclusions were made for women
who reported a history of any cancer before 1999 (except nonmelanoma
skin cancer) (n = 13,624), with a menopausal status of perimenopausal,
premenopausal, or unknown (n = 189); unveriﬁed self-reported breast
cancers (n = 26); or an invalid diagnosis date (n = 6). We also excluded
women with implausible dietary data [very low (<600 kcal/d) or very high
(>3500 kcal/d) total energy intakes or missing complete sections of the
FFQ (n = 1256)], leaving a ﬁnal analytic sample of 56,795.

Breast cancer case ascertainment. Cases included invasive breast
cancer cases diagnosed between January 1999 and July 2011. Most

questionnaires and then veriﬁed via medical records or linkage with
state registries or computerized linkage with the National Death Index
(n = 2451) (97.7%); however, some were listed as a primary or
contributory cause of death on their death certiﬁcate and were identiﬁed
through linkage with the National Death Index only (n = 58) (2.3%)
(27). Tumor clinical characteristics, when available (e.g., ER status),
were obtained from state registries or abstracted from medical records
and were available for 2134 cases (85%).

Assessment of dietary intake. Diet was assessed in 1999 with the use
of a modiﬁed 152-item Willett FFQ. Participants were asked how often
on average (never to 6 servings/d) they consumed a speciﬁc portion of
foods and beverages over the previous year. The food energy (kilocalories),
weight (grams), and nutrient content of foods and beverages were de-
termined with the use of a nutrient database from Harvard University that
included composition values from the USDA and supplemented with other
sources. No standardized method exists, to our knowledge, for selecting
foods and beverages to include in the ED calculation; however, Johnson
et al. (28) recommended using foods only and controlling for beverage
energy when it is an important confounder. Most studies that have
observed associations between dietary ED and disease status have done so
with the use of food-only ED (28). We calculated total dietary ED from
foods only and computed ED for individual foods. We also created a
total quantity of high-ED foods consumed by summing the consumption
of individual foods with EDs $2.25 (>225 kcal/100 g) (e.g., desserts,
candy, buttered or regular microwave popcorn, chips, breakfast
quick breads, peanut butter, jam, mayonnaise and other salad dressings,
higher-fat meats, etc.) (29). Nuts, seeds, wheat germ, and olive oil met
the criteria for high-ED foods but were excluded because according to
WCRF/AICR guidelines relatively unprocessed energy-dense foods such
as these may provide valuable nutrients and have not been shown to
contribute to weight gain when consumed as part of typical diets (29).

Statistical analysis. Statistical analyses were performed with the use
of SAS version 9.2 (SAS Institute). We calculated Spearman correla-
tion coefﬁcients between continuous variables of total dietary ED and
the quantity of high-ED foods consumed and BMI (in kg/m2) and
selected dietary variables [e.g., total energy intake (kilocalories per day)].
Total dietary ED and high-ED food consumption were categorized
into quantiles (quintiles or quartiles) of intake based on the overall
distribution in the cohort, with the lowest quantile serving as the
referent. Multivariable-adjusted breast cancer incidence rate ratios (RRs
and 95% CIs) were estimated for categories of ED in Cox proportional
hazards regression models, with the lowest category as the referent. The
associations between breast cancer risk and total dietary ED and
quantity of high-ED foods consumed were evaluated in models that
adjusted for age, race/ethnicity, educational status, age at menarche, age at
ﬁrst birth and parity, age at menopause, family history of breast cancer, and
hormone replacement therapy use. Final models were evaluated with and
without BMI as a categorical variable. Several other potential covariates did
not appreciably contribute to model ﬁt or interpretation and thus were
not included in the ﬁnal models. These variables included adult weight
gain, waist circumference, smoking status, menstrual cycle regularity, oral
contraceptive use, physical activity, sitting time, total energy intake and
energy intake from beverages, alcohol consumption, history of benign
breast disease, and recent mammography. Tests of linear trends were
conducted in ﬁnal multivariable models by assigning the median value from
each quintile of ED and modeling this value as a continuous variable. The
Cox proportional hazards assumption was tested by modeling multiplica-
tive interaction terms between ED variables and time. We evaluated
interactions by BMI, age, and physical activity with ED by including each
individual factor and its cross-product term with the ED quintile in separate
multivariable models with the use of the likelihood ratio test. We also
evaluated whether the associations between total dietary ED or high-ED
foods (modeled as quartiles because of the small numbers of ER2 cases)
and postmenopausal breast cancer risk differed by ER status. For these
analyses, we used joint Cox proportional hazards models (30) and censored
women when they were diagnosed with breast cancer with the ER status
that was not the outcome of the particular analysis. Results from 2-sided
chi-square tests were considered statistically signiﬁcant at P < 0.05.

Results

During a median follow-up of 11.7 y, 2509 breast cancer cases
were identiﬁed; 2134 had information on ER status (85% cases).
Among tumors with a known receptor status, 1857 (87%) were
ER+ and 277 (13%) were ER2. Baseline participant character-
istics are presented by category of total dietary ED in Table 1.
Median dietary ED was 1.5 kcal/g (IQR: 1.3–1.7 kcal/g). Women
who consumed higher-ED diets were more likely to be heavier,
to have a larger waist circumference, and to have experienced
greater adult weight gain (i.e., from age 18 y to baseline) than
those who consumed lower-ED diets. They were also more likely
to be current smokers and less physically active. As expected,
women who consumed higher-ED diets tended to have diets that
were also higher in total energy and fat but lower in ﬁber.

Spearman correlation coefﬁcients between total dietary ED
with total energy (kilocalories), fat (percentage of energy), and
ﬁber (g/1000 kcal) were 0.15, 0.49, and 20.70, respectively (all
P < 0.05; data not presented). In contrast, Spearman correlation
coefﬁcients between the quantity of high-ED foods consumed
with total energy (kilocalories), fat (percentage of energy), and
ﬁber (g/1000 kcal) were 0.75, 0.32, and 20.32, respectively (all
P < 0.05; data not presented). The correlation between total dietary
ED with the quantity of high-ED foods was 0.49; neither measure
was highly correlated with BMI (0.10 for total dietary ED and
0.09 for the quantity of high-ED foods).

The association between total dietary ED consumption and
postmenopausal breast cancer risk is shown in Table 2. Without
adjusting for BMI, there was a statistically signiﬁcant positive
association between total ED and risk [RR for ﬁfth quintile

compared with ﬁrst quintile (Q5v.1): 1.20; 95% CI: 1.05, 1.36;
P-trend = 0.03]. Adjusting for BMI attenuated the associations,
although conﬁdence limits for the comparisons of the ﬁfth to the
ﬁrst quintiles did not cross 1.0 (RR for Q5v.1: 1.17; 95% CI:
1.03, 1.33; P-trend = 0.09). In models that adjusted for BMI
there were no statistically signiﬁcant interactions by age, phys-
ical activity, or BMI. As shown in Table 2, in stratiﬁed analyses
associations for total ED with breast cancer risk were not
statistically signiﬁcant for either ER+ or ER2 cases. Differences
between risk subtypes were also not statistically signiﬁcant.

The association between the quantity of high-ED foods
consumed and postmenopausal breast cancer risk is shown in
Table 3. Both with and without adjusting for BMI, the quantity of
high-ED foods consumed was not signiﬁcantly associated with a
higher risk of breast cancer (RR for Q5v.1: 1.06; 95% CI: 0.93,
1.21 and RR for Q5v.1: 1.09; 95% CI: 0.96, 1.24, respectively).
Adding total energy intake to the model also had little effect on

the results (data not shown). Associations for high-ED foods with
breast cancer risk were not statistically signiﬁcant for either ER+
or ER2 cases (data not shown) and did not differ by ER status.

Discussion

In this large prospective cohort, women who consumed high-ED
diets were at modestly higher risk for postmenopausal breast
cancer during >10 y of follow-up. Additional adjustment for BMI,
which may be on the causal pathway, slightly attenuated this
association. Overall, risk estimates were heightened beginning
with the second quintile and were fairly stable across the
remaining upper quintiles. There was no effect modiﬁcation by
BMI, age, or physical activity, and results did not differ by ER
status. In analyses to assess the risk of greater high-ED food
intake, risk estimates tended to be positive but not statistically
signiﬁcant.

The epidemiologic evidence for a relation between a diet high
in ED and breast cancer risk is limited (31), and no previous
study to our knowledge has speciﬁcally examined total dietary
ED. Chandran et al. (31) evaluated the association between
consuming energy-dense foods and breast cancer in a population-
based case-control study, stratifying by race, age, and ER status.
In European American postmenopausal women only (n = 366
cases and 316 controls), a statistically signiﬁcant increased breast
cancer risk (OR for fourth quartile compared with ﬁrst quartile:
2.95; 95% CI: 1.66, 5.22; P-trend = 0.001) was observed with
frequent consumption (>11 compared with #3 servings/wk) of
energy-dense foods after adjusting for confounders, including
BMI. The results were more pronounced among women with
ER+ than ER2 cancers. In comparison, we found limited evidence
for an association between ED foods and risk. Adjusting for total
energy intake in the study by Chandran et al. (31) strengthened
their results for high-ED foods, whereas adjusting for total energy
intake had a minimal impact on the risk estimates in our study.
Differences in results between our study and that of Chandran
et al. may partly be because of the study design; CPS-II is a
prospective study with diet measured before diagnosis, whereas in
the Chandran et al. case-control study diet was recalled after case
diagnoses. In addition, our analyses included additional high-ED
foods (e.g., mayonnaise, butter or margarine).

Dietary ED may play a role in breast cancer risk through a
complex interplay of correlated and modiﬁable dietary factors,
including total energy intake, diet composition, and nutrient
intakes (32). High-ED diet consumption contributes to increased
energy intake and is associated with obesity (18, 33). Insulin
insensitivity, chronic inﬂammation, oxidative stress, and unfa-
vorable effects on growth factor and sex hormone concentra-
tions are metabolic consequences that accompany obesity and
are associated with carcinogenesis (34–37). In our study, we
observed that high-ED diets were higher in total energy and total
and saturated fat but lower in ﬁber. A controlled weight-
maintenance feeding study of 48 women tested the effects of diet
composition on a series of sex hormone concentrations (38). In
comparison with a high-fat (40% energy), low-ﬁber (12 g/d)
diet,
lower-fat (20–25% energy), higher-ﬁber (40 g/d) diets
signiﬁcantly decreased (29% to 215%) serum concentrations
of sex hormones linked to breast cancer risk (38). Over a womanÕs
lifetime response to a high-ED diet could inﬂuence breast cancer
risk through the generation of mutagenic metabolites and tissue
growth stimulation (39). Last, dietary patterns characterized by
higher intakes of reﬁned starches, added sugar, and saturated
fats and lower consumption of fruits, vegetables, and ﬁber lead
to lower intakes of antioxidants (e.g., carotenoids) and other
potentially anticarcinogenic phytochemicals (8). Several studies
have reported inverse associations for plant-based dietary pat-
terns (likely low-ED), deﬁned either with the use of data-driven
approaches or a priori indexes, with the risk of ER2 breast cancers,
but associations with overall breast cancer have been inconsis-
tent (10–16). Nevertheless, diets lacking these constituents may
increase DNA damage susceptibility, unchecked cellular prolif-
eration, and systemic inﬂammation (40–42).

This large prospective study has several strengths. It included
a long follow-up time, and many covariates were available for
the analysis. Dietary data were collected before diagnosis with
the use of a well-characterized instrument designed to assess
usual dietary intake and validated with a series of four 1-wk
dietary records collected in a demographically similar group of
women. Pearson correlation coefﬁcients for comparing energy-
adjusted total fat and ﬁber (dietary ED was not assessed)
between the FFQ and means of food records were 0.53 and 0.58,

respectively (25, 43). Nevertheless, there are measurement errors
associated with all dietary assessment methods, and there were
likely measurement errors in the calculation of ED in our study.
For example, behavior changes contributing to modest but
persistent decreases in dietary ED, such as selecting lower-fat
versions of foods or adding vegetables to higher-ED foods (e.g.,
pizza, sandwiches, other mixed dishes) are challenging to capture
with FFQs. We used a single questionnaire to characterize dietary
intake to maximize our sample size; however, a subset of the
population that also had dietary data collected in 2003 demon-
strated stability in dietary ED estimates over time. For example,
;80% of respondents in the highest category of ED (i.e., ﬁfth
quintile) in 1999 reported dietary intakes that placed them in
either the fourth or ﬁfth quintile in 2003. Residual confounding
by BMI or other factors cannot be ruled out. Finally, the CPS-II
Nutrition Cohort includes mostly older, white, middle-class
women, which has implications for the generalizability of our
observations to younger and more diverse populations of women.
In summary, our results provide evidence of a modest positive
association between dietary ED and postmenopausal breast
cancer risk. To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst analysis to examine
the association between overall dietary energy density and breast
cancer risk. The quality of a wide variety of dietary patterns can
be increased through simultaneously reducing saturated fat and
increasing ﬁber and vegetable and fruit intakes. Our data support
the value of dietary patterns that incorporate fruits and vegetables
and other low-ED foods that may facilitate weight management
and reduce the risk of postmenopausal breast cancer.

Abstract

Background: Flavonoids are bioactive polyphenolic compounds found in fruits, vegetables, and beverages of plant origin.

Previous studies have shown that ﬂavonoid intake reduces the risk of certain cancers; however, few studies to date have

examined associations of ﬂavonoids with upper gastrointestinal cancers or used prospective cohorts.

Objective: Our study examined the association between intake of ﬂavonoids (anthocyanidins, ﬂavan-3-ols, ﬂavanones,

ﬂavones, ﬂavonols, and isoﬂavones) and risk of head and neck, esophageal, and gastric cancers.

Methods: The NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study is a prospective cohort study that consists of 469,008 participants. Over a

mean 12-y follow-up, 2453 head and neck (including 1078 oral cavity, 424 pharyngeal, and 817 laryngeal), 1165 esophageal

(890 adenocarcinoma and 275 squamous cell carcinoma), and 1297 gastric (625 cardia and 672 noncardia) cancer cases

were identiﬁed. We used Cox proportional hazards regression models to estimate HRs and CIs for the associations
between ﬂavonoid intake assessed at study baseline and cancer outcomes. For 56 hypotheses examined, P-trend values

were adjusted using the Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) procedure for false discovery rate control.

Results: The highest quintile of total ﬂavonoid intake was associated with a 24% lower risk of head and neck cancer (HR:
0.76; 95% CI: 0.66, 0.86; BH-adjusted 95% CI: 0.63, 0.91; P-trend = 0.02) compared with the lowest quintile. Notably,

anthocyanidins were associated with a 28% lower risk of head and neck cancer (HR: 0.72; 95% CI: 0.62, 0.82; BH-adjusted
95% CI: 0.59, 0.87; P-trend = 0.0005), and ﬂavanones were associated with a 22% lower risk of head and neck cancer (HR:
0.78; 95% CI: 0.68, 0.89; BH-adjusted 95% CI: 0.64, 0.94; P-trend: 0.02). No associations between ﬂavonoid intake and

risk of esophageal or gastric cancers were found.

Conclusions: Our results indicate that ﬂavonoid intake is associated with lower head and neck cancer risk. These

associations suggest a protective effect of dietary ﬂavonoids on head and neck cancer risk, and thus potential as a risk
reduction strategy. J Nutr 2017;147:1729–38.

vegetables, and beverages of plant origin (1). Epidemiologic
studies have shown that diets high in fruits and vegetables are
associated with a decreased risk of upper gastrointestinal cancers,
including cancers of the head and neck (2), esophagus (3, 4), and
stomach (5). Flavonoids are hypothesized to account for a
portion of this risk reduction through chemopreventive mech-
anisms of cell cycle regulation, cellular proliferation, apopto-
sis, and modulation of carcinogen metabolism and inﬂammatory
pathways (6).

Upper gastrointestinal cancers represent an etiologically
diverse group of cancers and can be divided by histologic classi-
ﬁcations (i.e., squamous cell carcinoma or adenocarcinoma).

Head and neck cancers include squamous cell carcinomas
of the oral cavity, pharynx, and larynx. The primary risk
factors for head and neck cancer are tobacco use and alcohol
consumption (7–9). Esophageal cancer consists of squamous cell
carcinoma, which can occur throughout the esophagus, and
adenocarcinoma, which is typically located in the distal third
of the esophagus near the gastroesophageal junction (10).
The primary risk factors for esophageal squamous cell carci-
noma are squamous dysplasia (11) and tobacco use and alcohol
consumption (12), whereas esophageal adenocarcinoma risk
factors include gastroesophageal reﬂux disease (13), obesity
(14), and tobacco use (15). Gastric cancers include adenocarci-
nomas of the cardia (i.e., the proximal portion of the stomach
near the gastroesophageal junction) and noncardia (i.e., the
distal portion of the stomach) (16). The primary risk factors
for gastric cardia adenocarcinoma are similar to esophageal
adenocarcinoma (13–15), whereas risk factors for noncardia
gastric adenocarcinoma include Helicobacter pylori and gastric
ulcers (16) and tobacco use (12).

Epidemiologic studies have shown inverse associations be-
tween ﬂavonoids and cancers of the head and neck (17–19),
esophagus (20), and stomach (21–29). However, few studies to
date have examined associations using a prospective cohort, and
no prospective studies to date have examined head and neck
cancer. Clariﬁcation of these associations may help elucidate
the underlying etiology and provide empirical support for
utilizing ﬂavonoid compounds as potential cancer risk reduc-
tion strategies.

We used data from the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study to
investigate the relation between dietary intake of ﬂavonoids and
incidence of head and neck, esophageal, and gastric cancers.

Methods

Study population. The NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study is a
prospective cohort study consisting of AARP (formerly known as
the American Association of Retired Persons) members residing in 6
states (California, Florida, Louisiana, New Jersey, North Carolina, and
Pennsylvania) and 2 metropolitan areas (Atlanta, Georgia, and Detroit,
Michigan) (30). Between 1995 and 1996, baseline information including
dietary intake, demographic characteristics, and health behaviors was
collected from AARP members aged 50–71 y. This information was
collected by mailing questionnaires to 3.5 million members; 566,398
members completed the questionnaire and consented to participate in
the study. The National Cancer Institute Institutional Review Board
approved the NIH-AARP study protocol. We excluded subjects with
cancer at baseline (n = 52,708), death-only reports of cancer (n = 4421),
proxy reports (n = 14,245), and total energy intake outside the range of
500–3500 kcal/d for women and 800–4000 kcal/d for men (n = 26,016)
(31). Our analytic sample included 275,982 men and 193,026 women
(Supplemental Figure 1).

Cohort follow-up and case ascertainment. Study participants were
followed from the date baseline information was collected to the date of
the ﬁrst cancer diagnosis, the date of death, the date the individual
moved out of case ascertainment area, or the end of the study period (31
December 2011). Cancer cases were identiﬁed by probabilistic linkage
with 11 cancer registries (including states and areas of participant
recruitment and Arizona, Nevada, and Texas). This method of case ascer-
tainment was previously shown to detect ~90% of all incident cancer cases
in the NIH-AARP cohort (32).

The cases were classiﬁed using topography and morphology codes
from the third edition of the International Classiﬁcation of Disease for
Oncology (33). All cases of head and neck cancer with squamous cell
carcinoma histology (morphology codes 8010, 8020, 8021, 8032, 8045,
8050, 8051, 8052, 8070, 8071, 8072, 8073, 8074, 8075, 8076, and

8083) were included in this analysis (topography codes C00.0–C13.9,
C14.0, C14.2, C14.8, and C32.0–C32.9). The site of head and neck
cancer was classiﬁed as follows: oral cavity (C00.0–C06.9), oro- and
hypopharynx (C09.0–C09.9, C10.0–C10.9, C12.9, and C13.0–C13.9),
and larynx (C32.0–C32.9). Cancers were classiﬁed as esophageal with
topography codes of C15.0–C15.9. Esophageal cancers were further
classiﬁed by squamous cell carcinoma (morphology codes 8070, 8071,
8072, and 8074) and adenocarcinoma (8140, 8142, 8144, 8260, 8261,
8263, 8310, 8480, 8481, 8490, and 8570) histology. All cases of gastric
cancer with adenocarcinoma histology (morphology codes: 8010, 8012,
8021, 8140, 8142, 8143, 8144, 8145, 8210, 8211, 8255, 8260, 8261,
8263, 8310, 8480, 8481, 8490, 8510, and 8574) were included in this
analysis. Gastric adenocarcinomas were classiﬁed as cardia (C16.0) and
noncardia (C16.1–C16.9).

Dietary data. Dietary data for the previous 12 mo were collected
at baseline using an early version of the National Cancer Institute
Diet History Questionnaire (http://dietandhealth.cancer.gov/docs/
diet_questionnaire_baseline.pdf), which is a self-administered FFQ.
Study participants reported the frequency of consumption for 124
food items and corresponding portion sizes for 116 food items.

Flavonoid content for each food item was obtained using the 2015
USDA Expanded Flavonoid Database for the Assessment of Dietary
Intakes (34). The USDA Nutrient Data Laboratory constructed this
ﬂavonoid database based on the analytical values from the 2013 USDA
Database for the Flavonoid Content of Selected Foods for 506 foods (35)
and the 2008 USDA Database for the Isoﬂavone Content of Selected
Foods for 557 foods (36). To create the expanded ﬂavonoid database,
analytical ﬂavonoid values were ﬁrst assigned to foods with direct
matches from either of the above-mentioned 2008 or 2013 USDA
databases. Next, values were assigned to foods that lacked a direct match
using $1 of the following criteria: moisture adjustment, retention
factors, food yield factors, substitution with similar foods, market
share, generic proﬁles, and other sources [e.g., Phenol-Explorer, release
2.0 (37)] (34). Overall, the expanded ﬂavonoid database contains data
on 29 individual ﬂavonoids and 6 ﬂavonoid classes (anthocyanidins,
ﬂavan-3-ols, ﬂavanones, ﬂavones, ﬂavonols, and isoﬂavones) for 2926
foods found in the USDA National Nutrient Database for Standard
Reference (38).

The FFQ line-item weights were based on ‘‘usual’’ population
consumption, which was estimated using 24-h recall data from the
1994–1996 USDA Continuing Survey of Food Intakes by Individuals
(CSFII) (39). Generally, these weights are determined by some metric of
usual population consumption, but often these are based on a more
restrictive list. For example, an FFQ may typically deﬁne the weights of
the line item ‘‘Other fruit juice or fruit juice mixture (such as apple,
grape, pineapple, or others)’’ as 50% of consumption from apple juice,
40% from grape juice, and 10% from pineapple juice. However, in the
NIH-AARP study, any other reported type of fruit juice (e.g., guava juice
drink or grapefruit juice) would receive a portion of the line-item weight,
corresponding to the frequency of report on the 24-h recalls. Thus, foods
and beverages reported on CSFII 24-h recalls were placed into food
groups consistent with line items on the NIH-AARP study FFQ, and
nutrient estimates were calculated based on a weighted mean of foods
in each group. Because the CSFII nutrient database did not include
ﬂavonoid values, we added them to the original CSFII database to create
NIH-AARP study FFQ ﬂavonoid values using methodology consistent
with previous reports (40). For a few foods (e.g., poblano peppers),
ﬂavonoid values were not available in the database. We thus matched
these to a similar food (i.e., green hot chili peppers), which we thought
would have similar ﬂavonoid values. This database was then linked with
an individual participantÕs reported frequency of consumption and the
corresponding portion size for each line item. Dietary sources of
ﬂavonoid intake are presented in Supplemental Table 1.

We derived intakes of 6 ﬂavonoid classes: anthocyanidins (cyanidin,
delphinidin, malvidin, pelargonidin, peonidin, petunidin), ﬂavan-3-ols (cat-
echin, epicatechin, epicatechin 3-gallate, epigallocatechin, epigallocatechin
3-gallate, gallocatechin, theaﬂavin, theaﬂavin 3-gallate, theaﬂavin 3#-gallate,
theaﬂavin 3,3#-digallate, thearubigins), ﬂavanones (eriodictyol, hesperetin,
naringenin), ﬂavones (apigenin, luteolin), ﬂavonols (isorhamnetin, kaempferol,

myricetin, quercetin), and isoﬂavones (daidzein, genistein, glycitein). We
also derived intakes of total ﬂavonoids (summation of all classes).

Statistical analysis. Cox proportional hazards models were used to
calculate HRs and 95% CIs for the association between ﬂavonoid intake
and incidence of each tumor type as distinct outcomes, with years of
follow-up as the underlying time metric. Follow-up of the analytic cohort
occurred from the time at completion of baseline questionnaire until an
event (i.e., incident upper gastrointestinal cancer) or right-censoring
(i.e., other cancer diagnosis, death, loss to follow-up, or last date of
follow-up), whichever occurred ﬁrst. In models examining one upper
gastrointestinal cancer (e.g., head and neck cancer) as the primary
outcome, the other upper gastrointestinal cancers (i.e., esophageal and
gastric cancer) were censored events and vice versa. Subjects with
missing values were removed from the models. The proportional hazards

assumption was tested using an interaction term between total ﬂavo-
noids (deﬁned as continuous and categorical) and log(time) in models
that included confounders, and no interaction was observed (P $ 0.05).
For our primary analysis, absolute ﬂavonoid intakes were catego-
rized as quintiles, based on the distribution of intake among all study
participants (31). Tests of linear trend were performed based on the
quintile-speciﬁc medians of ﬂavonoid intake. Because continuous ﬂavo-
noid intake (expressed as mg/d) was right skewed, ﬂavonoid intakes
were also analyzed as log2-transformed continuous variables. The HR
in relation to a 1-unit change in log2-transformed ﬂavonoid intake
corresponds to a doubling of absolute ﬂavonoid intake (Supplemental
Table 2).

Effect modiﬁcation by age, sex, race, education, smoking status, BMI
(in kg/m2), energy intake, alcohol intake, self-rated health, and vigorous
physical activity was assessed using likelihood ratio tests comparing

$70 y), sex, race (non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, or other), education (less than high school, completed high school or post–high
school training other than college, some college or college graduate, or postgraduate), smoking status (never smoker, former smoker of
#20 or .20 cigarettes/d, or current smoker of #20 or .20 cigarettes/d), BMI (in kg/m2: ,25, 25 to ,30, or $30), alcohol intake (0–0.19,
0.20–1.83, 1.84–11.5, or 11.6–450.94 g/d), self-reported health (excellent, very good, good, fair, or poor), vigorous physical activity of
$20 min (never, rarely, 1–3 times/mo, or 1–2, 3–4, or $5 times/wk), and total energy intake (expressed as kcal/d). HRs compare the risk of
developing cancer for participants in each quintile of ﬂavonoid intake to participants in the lowest quintile of ﬂavonoid intake, holding all
other covariates constant. BH, Benjamini-Hochberg.

regression models with and without a multiplicative term (41). We found
no evidence of effect modiﬁcation (P $ 0.05).

We conducted a backward stepwise regression to evaluate potential
confounders. Variables remained in the adjusted model if they were
signiﬁcant (P < 0.10) in the backward stepwise selection (42). All
covariates met the inclusion criteria and were included in the ﬁnal
models as follows: age at baseline (<55, 55–59, 60–64, 65–69, or $70 y),
sex, race (non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, or other), education
(less than high school, completed high school or post–high school
training other than college, some college or college graduate, or post-
graduate), smoking status (never smoker, former smoker of #20 or >20
cigarettes/d, or current smoker of #20 or >20 cigarettes/d), BMI (<25,
25 to <30, or $30), alcohol intake (quartiles of intake: 0–0.19, 0.20–
1.83, 1.84–11.5, or 11.6–450.94 g/d), self-rated health (excellent, very
good, good, fair, or poor), and vigorous physical activity of $20 min
(never, rarely, 1–3 times/mo, or 1–2, 3–4, or $5 times/wk). Total energy
intake (expressed as kcal/d) was included for adjustment as an a priori
confounder (43).

The linear trend tests were adjusted for multiple comparisons using
the Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) procedure for false discovery rate
control at the 0.05 level for 56 comparisons (44). In addition, for the
6 associations discovered by the BH procedure, we calculated BH-adjusted
CIs (45) for a comparison of quintile 5 and quintile 1 [i.e., CI at level
1 – 0.05 3 (6/56)]. The BH-adjusted CIs controlled the false coverage
rate (45), which is the expected fraction of CIs not covering their true
parameters among the discovered associations, at the 0.05 level. All
P values were 2 sided. Statistical analyses were conducted using SAS
software (version 9.3; SAS Institute).

Sensitivity analysis. We conducted a sensitivity analysis comparing
the results from the standard multivariate model, the nutrient density
model (Supplemental Table 3), and the residual model (Supplemental
Table 4) (31). The estimated HRs were not substantially different;
therefore, we chose to present results adjusted utilizing the standard
multivariate approach for ease of interpretation. Finally, we conducted
a 5-y lag analysis, excluding cases that developed cancer within the
ﬁrst 5-y of follow-up by delaying the start of follow-up for all
participants (Supplemental Tables 5–7), as individuals with symptoms
attributed to cancer (e.g., dysphagia) may have altered their dietary
habits.

Results

1297 gastric (625 cardia and 672 noncardia) cancer cases were
identiﬁed. Demographic characteristics of our study cohort by
quintile of total ﬂavonoid intake are presented in Table 1.
Compared with the lowest quintile, participants in the highest
quintile of total ﬂavonoid intake were more likely to have a
postgraduate education and were less likely to be smokers.

The highest quintile of total ﬂavonoid intake was associated
with a 24% lower risk of head and neck cancer (HR: 0.76; 95% CI:
0.66, 0.86; BH-adjusted 95% CI: 0.63, 0.91; P-trend = 0.02)
compared with the lowest quintile (Table 2). Dietary intake
of anthocyanidins was associated with a 28% lower risk of
head and neck cancer (HR: 0.72; 95% CI: 0.62, 0.82;
BH-adjusted 95% CI: 0.59, 0.87; P-trend = 0.0005), which
was also seen by subsite of oral cavity (HR: 0.78; 95% CI: 0.63,
0.96; BH-adjusted 95% CI: 0.58, 1.05; P-trend = 0.04) and
laryngeal (HR: 0.62; 95% CI: 0.48, 0.80; BH-adjusted 95% CI:
0.44, 0.89; P-trend = 0.02). Flavanone intake was associated
with a 22% lower risk of head and neck cancer (HR: 0.78; 95% CI:
0.68, 0.89; BH-adjusted 95% CI: 0.64, 0.94; P-trend = 0.02),
which was also seen for subsite of pharyngeal (HR: 0.58; 95% CI:
0.41, 0.82; BH-adjusted 95% CI: 0.36, 0.95; P-trend = 0.03).

No association was observed between ﬂavonoid intake and
esophageal adenocarcinoma or esophageal squamous cell carci-

respectively) (Table 3). Similar to esophageal cancer, no asso-

adenocarcinoma or noncardia gastric adenocarcinoma (total
ﬂavonoids: BH-adjusted P-trend = 0.8 and 0.5, respectively)
(Table 4).

Discussion

In this large prospective study, we observed that total dietary
ﬂavonoid intake was associated with a 24% lower risk of head
and neck but not esophageal or gastric cancer. Anthocyanidins
and ﬂavanones were also associated with a lower risk of head and
neck cancer, but these inverse associations varied by tumor
subsite. No association was observed between any ﬂavonoid
class and esophageal or gastric cancer.

Over a mean follow-up of 12 y, 2453 head and neck (including 1078
oral cavity, 424 pharyngeal, and 817 laryngeal), 1165 esophageal
(890 adenocarcinoma, and 275 squamous cell carcinoma), and

Our ﬁndings for head and neck cancer are consistent with 2
previous case-control studies from Italy, which reported that
intake of total ﬂavonoids, ﬂavanones, and ﬂavonols was inversely

associated with all head and neck cancers (17, 46). Two previous
epidemiologic studies showed an inverse association between
intake of anthocyanidins and risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma
and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (21, 47). However, in
our study, we found no association between ﬂavonoid intake and
risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma or esophageal squamous
cell carcinoma. In addition, we report no association between
ﬂavonoid intake and gastric cancers, contrary to previous studies
that showed inverse associations between gastric cancer and
intake of total ﬂavonoids (23), anthocyanidins (23), ﬂavan-3-ols
(23), ﬂavanones (22), ﬂavones (22, 23), and ﬂavonols (22, 23, 25,
26). Possible reasons for the discrepancies between our study and
previous studies could be differences in the underlying population
and in adjustment factors. To date, the NIH-AARP study does not
have information on H. pylori infection or gastroesophageal
reﬂux disease, both of which could be potential confounders for
some subsites.

An inverse association between ﬂavonoid intake and cancer risk
is biologically plausible. In vitro studies showed that ﬂavonoids
have a number of chemopreventive mechanisms, including cell
cycle regulation, cellular proliferation, apoptosis, and modula-
tion of carcinogen metabolism and inﬂammatory pathways (6).
In vivo clinical and animal studies provide support for the
potential chemopreventive effects of ﬂavonoids. Similar to our
reported ﬁndings, ﬂavonoids were shown to reduce the incidence
of oral cancers in rodent models. Flavan-3-ols (i.e., catechin and
epicatechin 3-gallate), ﬂavanones (i.e., naringenin), ﬂavones (i.e.,
apigenin), and ﬂavonols (i.e., quercetin) all reduced the incidence
of oral tumors in hamster models (e.g., 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]
anthracene–induced carcinogenesis) (48).

To address the issue of multiple comparisons, we calculated
BH-adjusted P values. At a threshold of BH-adjusted P-trend
values # 0.05, total ﬂavonoids, anthocyanidins, and ﬂavanones
were the only ﬂavonoids considered to be statistically signiﬁ-
cantly associated with head and neck cancer. Adjusting for
multiple comparisons in this way protects against making >5%
false-positive associations across the 56 tests of trend. Thus, we
drew our main conclusions from these BH-adjusted P values, but

we also present unadjusted P values and 95% CIs in Tables 2–4
for the readerÕs convenience (31, 49).

Our study has several limitations. The ﬁrst potential source of
error is in estimating individual ﬂavonoid intakes based on
linking foods reported in the FFQ to the USDA ﬂavonoid
database. Flavonoid content of individual food items, particu-
larly fruits and vegetables, varies by plant varieties, degree of
ripeness, storage conditions, distance transported to market,
environmental factors affecting plant growth, horticultural
practices, industrial processing, and cooking methods (50).
Therefore, the study population may consume foods that differ
from the foods utilized to create estimates of ﬂavonoid content
in the nutrient database (34). In addition, the NIH-AARP study
population is from 8 different states. Thus, there may be
differences in the amount of ﬂavonoids consumed by study
participants as a result of regional differences. We examined the
association between total ﬂavonoids and head and neck cancer
and did not ﬁnd substantial differences by state (data not
shown). To determine the extent of ﬂavonoid variability, the
USDA Food Composition and Nutrient Data Laboratories also
sampled >60 fruits, vegetables, and nuts from 4 US regions at
2 times of the year. Although ﬂavonoid content was variable
within and between foods, ﬂavonoid values reported in the
USDA databases were similar to the mean ﬂavonoid content
determined by the USDA Food Composition and Nutrient Data
Laboratories (51). This issue of ﬂavonoid content estimation
applies to all studies utilizing nutritional databases to estimate
values for dietary intake (31).

The difference we observed in the median intake of total
ﬂavonoids between participants in the ﬁfth compared with the
ﬁrst quintiles was roughly equivalent to 2 cups tea/d (;473 mL).
However, the FFQ used for the NIH-AARP cohort did not
include line items on certain ﬂavonoid-rich foods like berries
(other than strawberries) and tofu. Although the FFQ did ask
about tea consumption, it did not capture the types of tea
(e.g., black versus green), which differ in ﬂavonoid concentration.
Thus, individual estimates of ﬂavonoid intake may be misclassiﬁed.
However, consumption of these ﬂavonoid-rich foods in the US
population is low (52) and is therefore unlikely to considerably
change the mean measured ﬂavonoid intake. FFQs also cannot

include every possible food item and therefore must be selective
in which foods are included. The FFQ utilized in our study was
designed to reﬂect the ‘‘typical’’ American diet; thus, there is
potential misclassiﬁcation of ﬂavonoid intake for subjects with
ethnic or specialty diets. For example, vegetarians are more likely
to consume tofu or tofu-based products, which are not assessed on
this FFQ and thus lead to misclassiﬁcation. In addition, FFQs are
known to suffer from measurement error. We attempted to mini-
mize measurement error, which commonly results in attenuated
risk estimates (53), by adjusting the models for energy intake (54).
However, we cannot exclude the possibility that some error
remains.

Bioavailability is also another source of measurement misclas-
siﬁcation. Measured dietary intake of ﬂavonoids may differ from
the internal dose. Little is known about the bioavailability of
ﬂavonoids, how metabolism of ﬂavonoids varies by individuals,
and the directed effect of ﬂavonoids on epithelial surfaces as
ﬂavonoids traverse the upper gastrointestinal tract (55). In
addition, ﬂavonoid absorption proﬁles are variable, with maxi-
mum circulating concentrations reached between 0.5 and 9 h
after dietary intake (56). Thus, biomarkers of ﬂavonoid intake
may not be highly correlated with usual adult dietary intake.
However, ﬂavonoid biomarkers in 24-h urine samples have
shown good correlation with fruit and vegetable intake calculated
from a prior-month FFQ (validity coefﬁcients = 0.43–0.66) (57).
Dysphagia (or difﬁculty swallowing) is a common symptom
of upper gastrointestinal cancers, which can lead individuals to
alter dietary habits. However, we observed similar results when
we conducted a 5-y lag analysis, excluding cases that developed
cancer within the ﬁrst 5-y of follow-up by delaying the start of
follow-up for all participants. Thus, an altered dietary state
owing to underlying disease is unlikely to account for the
associations, or lack thereof, that we observed.

Previous studies using the NIH-AARP data have reported on
the association between fruit and vegetable intake and upper
gastrointestinal cancers (58–60). An inverse association be-
tween fruit and vegetable intake and head and neck cancer was
reported (58), but the associations with esophageal (59) and
gastric (60) cancer were limited. Because ﬂavonoids are concen-
trated in fruits and vegetables (50), the association between
ﬂavonoids and head and neck cancer incidence may reﬂect diets
with greater consumption of such foods or a healthy lifestyle in
general. Because of issues of collinearity between fruit and
vegetable intake and ﬂavonoids (61), we were unable to assess
the effects of ﬂavonoids independent of fruit and vegetable
intake. In addition, ingestion of fatty foods can result in a
proinﬂammatory response (62). Some foods that contribute to
dietary ﬂavonoid intake, such as donuts and hotdogs, also have
high fat content. However, these foods contribute little to total
ﬂavonoid consumption. For instance, a medium plain cake-type
donut contains ~2.9 mg of ﬂavonoids, whereas a beef hotdog
contains ~0.9 mg (34).

Finally,

internal and external validity of the NIH-AARP
cohort may be lacking because of the low response rate (17.6%).
Responders to the baseline questionnaire were predominately
white, predominately noncurrent smokers, and more educated,
and they consumed less red meat and fat and more fruits and
vegetables compared with the general US population (30). In
addition, the dietary intake distributions were wider than what
has been reported in the general US population. This combina-
tion of altered and widened dietary intake distributions may
have compensated for the low response rate by allowing for
adequate numbers of individuals in the dietary intake extremes
(30). These results are still generalizable to those at highest risk

of developing esophageal adenocarcinoma and gastric cardia
adenocarcinoma, because the majority of the NIH-AARP cohort
consists of non-Hispanic white men and the rates of esophageal
adenocarcinoma and gastric cardia adenocarcinoma are high-
est in this racial/ethnic group (63). However, studies show that
rates of head and neck cancer (64), esophageal squamous cell
carcinoma, and noncardia gastric adenocarcinoma (63) are
higher among black men. Thus, the results from our study may
not be generalizable to individuals at the highest risk for these
cancer types.

Strengths of our study include its large sample size and long
follow-up, which yielded large numbers of outcomes for these
rare cancer types. In addition, we utilized the USDA expanded
ﬂavonoid database, which included a greater scope of foods than
used in previous studies and also accounts for cooking methods
not previously accounted for in the USDA ﬂavonoid databases.
Our use of this updated and expanded ﬂavonoid database
improves the accuracy of our intake measurement.

Another strength of our study is its prospective cohort design,
which minimizes differential information bias from self-reported
dietary intake compared with previous case-control studies. In
addition, the data collected from the FFQs administered in the
NIH-AARP cohort were validated against 2 nonconsecutive
24-h dietary recalls, administered within a year of the baseline
questionnaire to a stratiﬁed random sample of participants (54).
Deattenuated ﬂavonoid correlation coefﬁcients were 0.57 for
men and 0.65 for women (65), which are consistent with other
macro- and micronutrients examined in the NIH-AARP study
(40, 54).

In conclusion, our ﬁndings suggest that dietary intake of
ﬂavonoids is associated with a lower risk of head and neck
cancers. This evidence suggests that dietary ﬂavonoids could
potentially be used as a risk reduction strategy for individuals at
high risk of head and neck cancer to reduce the incidence of these
highly fatal cancers. However, further laboratory, clinical, and
epidemiologic research is warranted before deﬁnitive conclu-
sions can be drawn about the chemopreventive potential, or lack
thereof, of dietary ﬂavonoids and upper gastrointestinal cancers.

Abstract

Background: Few prospective studies have examined the preventive role of fruit and vegetable intakes against cancer in

Asian populations.

Objective: This prospective study evaluated the associations between total fruit intake, total vegetable intake, and total

fruit and vegetable intake and total cancer incidence and mortality.

Methods: This prospective cohort study included 14,198 men 40–59 y of age enrolled in the Seoul Male Cohort Study

from 1991 to 1993. Fruit and vegetable intakes were assessed by a validated food-frequency questionnaire. We used Cox

proportional hazard regression models to compute RR ratios and 95% CIs.

Results: During the follow-up period from 1993 to 2008, 1343 men were diagnosed with cancer, and 507 died of cancer. Total

vegetable intake was linearly associated with cancer incidence but was nonlinearly associated with cancer mortality; by comparing
$500 g/d with <100 g/d of total vegetable intake, the multivariable-adjusted RR for total cancer incidence was 0.72 (95% CI: 0.58,
0.90; P-trend: 0.02; P-nonlinearity: 0.06). For total cancer mortality, the multivariable-adjusted RRs comparing 100 to <200 g/d, 200
to <300 g/d, 300 to <500 g/d, and $500 g/d with <100 g/d of total vegetable intake were 0.68 (95% CI: 0.53, 0.88), 0.75 (95% CI:
0.57, 0.98), 0.72 (95% CI: 0.54, 0.95), and 0.67 (95% CI: 0.47, 0.95), respectively (P-trend: 0.09; P-nonlinearity: 0.01). No
associations were found between total fruit intake and total cancer incidence and mortality; $300 g/d vs. <50 g/d, RR: 1.04 (95%
CI: 0.87, 1.25; P-trend 5 0.56) for incidence and RR: 0.89 (95% CI: 0.66, 1.21; P-trend 5 0.71) for mortality.

Conclusions: Our ﬁndings suggest that total vegetable intake is linearly associated with cancer incidence but

nonlinearly associated with total cancer mortality in middle-aged Korean men. However, total fruit intake is not associated
with total cancer incidence or mortality. J Nutr 2015;145:1249–55.

A diet rich in fruits and vegetables has been suggested to
decrease cancer risk, and this hypothesis was extensively

examined in epidemiologic studies in Western populations (1).
In the 1990s, the WHO and the World Cancer Research Fund
and the American Institute for Cancer Research (WCRF/AICR)
emphasized the beneﬁcial effect of fruit and vegetable intake on
cancer prevention because a relatively large number of case–
control studies supported this hypothesis (2, 3). The ﬁrst report
by the WCRF/AICR (1997) concluded that the preventive effects
of high fruit and vegetable consumption against cancer risk were
convincing, showing at least a 20% reduction in total cancer risk
with $400 g/d of fruit and vegetable intake (3). However, the
evidence was limited because most of the reviewed studies were
case–control studies, which are susceptible to recall and selection

bias. Because the cumulative results from prospective cohort
studies have not provided similar evidence of the beneﬁts of fruit
and vegetable intake in cancer prevention as the previous case–
control studies, the second WCRF/AICR report downgraded the
level of evidence for several cancer types from convincing to
probable, limited, or suggestive in 2007 (4, 5–13, 27). Large
prospective studies have shown weaker evidence, such as weak
or null associations (5–8). A meta-analysis that evaluated the
association between total fruit and vegetable intake and colo-
rectal cancer risk showed no overall signiﬁcance (9); however,
the study also suggested that a reduction in risk was consistent
with a 100–200 g/d threshold, and there was no further beneﬁt
of increasing the intake above this level (9). Previous prospective
studies on the relation between total fruit and/or vegetable
intake and total cancer mortality have shown inconsistent
results (10–13).

Fruit and vegetable intake varies markedly across various
geographic locations, and Asian populations are estimated to
consume a diet with a relatively high content of vegetables (14).
To the best of our knowledge, this investigation is the ﬁrst study
to evaluate the associations between total fruit and vegetable
intake (combined and separately) and total cancer incidence and
mortality in a prospective study of middle-aged Korean men.

Methods

Study cohort. The study population consisted of participants in the
Seoul Male Cohort Study, a prospective cohort study designed to
investigate the association between lifestyle and dietary factors and
the incidence and mortality of cancer and additional chronic disease
outcomes (15). Between 1991 and 1993, we mailed a baseline
questionnaire to a random sample of 29,918 healthy men residing in
Seoul who received regular biennial general health screenings in 1990 as
beneﬁciaries of the Korea Medical Insurance Corporation. A total of
14,533 men 40–59 y of age returned the baseline self-administered
comprehensive questionnaires. Of these men, we excluded those who did
not complete the FFQs (n = 4), those who were diagnosed with cancer
before enrolling in the study (n = 22), those who had an implausible total
energy intake (>3 SDs from the log-transformed mean energy intake;
n = 100), or those with missing information about the main exposures
(n = 209). After these exclusions, 14,198 men were included in the
analysis. The Institutional Review Board of the Seoul National
University approved the protocol for this study, and all of the study
subjects provided written informed consent.

Dietary assessment. Habitual dietary intake was assessed at baseline
by using an 84-item self-administered FFQ designed and validated for
use in Korea (16). Participants were asked to report how often, on
average, they consumed food or beverage items during the previous year,
using 3 standard serving sizes. The FFQ included 8 possible responses
about frequency of consumption, ranging from ‘‘never or less than once
per month’’ to ‘‘two or more times per day.’’ Average daily fruit and
vegetable intake (in g/d) was calculated by multiplying intake frequency
(servings of food per day) with serving size (grams per serving), and the
sum was calculated from all relevant items. In the present analysis, we
included 13 vegetables (green vegetables,
lettuce, Chinese cabbage,
boiled vegetables, raw green vegetables, tomato, garlic, onion, ginseng,
kimchi, kimchi soup, white kimchi, or radish or cucumber seasoned with
soy sauce) and 12 fruits (tangerine, orange, peach, apple, plum, banana,
pear, melon, watermelon, strawberry, grape, kiwi). We excluded
potatoes from the vegetable group because of their high-starch and
-protein content (17). Total fruit intake only considered fresh fruit, not
fruit juice.

Assessment of nondietary factors. At baseline, participants com-
pleted a questionnaire on demographics, lifestyle, anthropometry, use of
level,
dietary supplements, medical and family history, educational

socioeconomic status, and occupational factors. BMI (in kg/m2) was
calculated on the basis of directly measuring height and weight collected
during their health examination. Pack-years of smoking were calculated
by multiplying the reported average number of cigarettes smoked per day
by the number of years of smoking and dividing by 20.

Ascertainment of cancers and cause of death. Men were followed
from the date of study entry until the date of cancer diagnosis, date of
death, or the end of follow-up period (31 December 2008). The
incidence of cancer was ascertained through unique 13-digit personal
identiﬁcation numbers in the Seoul Cancer Registry, a population-based
cancer registry, and the National Cancer Registration Program, a
nationwide hospital-based cancer registry (18). Incident cancer cases
were coded and classiﬁed according to the International Classiﬁcation of
Diseases for Oncology, 2nd edition (19) and converted according to the
International Classiﬁcation of Diseases, 10th edition (20). The dates and
underlying causes of death were identiﬁed through data linkage to
Korean death certiﬁcate data (21).

Statistical analysis. We used Cox proportional hazards regression
models to estimate the RRs and 95% CIs of the associations between
total fruit intake, total vegetable intake, and total fruit and vegetable
intake with total cancer incidence. In this prospective cohort study, we
also evaluated site-speciﬁc cancer risks in relation to total combined fruit
and vegetable intake, focusing on the following common types of cancers
in Korean men: stomach, colorectal, liver and bile duct, and lung
cancers. In the cancer incidence analyses, the number of person-years of
follow-up was calculated from the date of study entry until the date of
cancer diagnosis, death, or the end of the follow-up period, whichever
occurred ﬁrst. For total cancer mortality, the number of person-years of
follow-up was calculated from the date of study entry until the date of
death from cancer, death from any other cause, or the end of the follow-
up period, whichever occurred ﬁrst. The participants were classiﬁed into
categories of absolute intake. The following cutoffs were used to identify
the intake categories: <50, 50 to <100, 100 to <200, 200 to <300, and
$300 g/d for fruit intake; <100, 100 to <200, 200 to <300, 300 to <500,
and $500 g/d for vegetable intake; and <200, 200 to <300, 300 to <400,
400 to <600, 600 to <800, and $800 g/d for total combined fruit and
vegetable intake in the main analysis. In analyzing the common site-
speciﬁc cancers (22), we combined the two highest categories of total
combined fruit and vegetable intake because of the small number of
cases. We also chose different intake levels as the reference category
because of the small sample size.

All of the models were stratiﬁed by age at baseline and were further
adjusted for vigorous physical activity (<1, 1–2, or $3 h/wk), total
calorie intake (kcal/d, continuous), alcohol intake ( <0.1, 0.1 to <15, 15
to <30, or $30 g/d), red meat intake (g/d, continuous or missing
indicator), multivitamin use (none, 1–6 times/wk, daily, 2–3 times/d, or
missing), pack-years of smoking (, <0.1, 0.1 to <20, 20 to <40, or $40
pack-years), BMI (<18.5, 18.5 to <23, 23 to <25, $25, or missing),
educational level (less than high school, high school graduate or higher,
or missing), family history of cancer (yes or no), and history of diabetes
or cardiovascular disease at baseline (yes or no). In the additional
analyses, we simultaneously adjusted for total fruit and vegetable intake
in analyzing total vegetable intake or total fruit intake. If needed, missing
indicator variables were used to impute missing responses for each
measured covariate (red meat 0.5%, multivitamin use 2.4%, BMI 0.7%,
education level 2.6%). A test for linear trends across fruit and vegetable
intake categories was conducted by ﬁtting the median value of each
category as a continuous variable in the model and evaluating the
relation by using the Wald test. To examine for a possible nonlinear
relation, we examined the nonparametric regression curve by using
restricted cubic splines. Tests for nonlinearity were performed by using
the likelihood ratio test and comparing the model that only included the
linear term with the model that included the linear and cubic spline
terms. The models were visually inspected by using the restricted cubic
spline graphs (23, 24).

In addition, we repeated the analyses after excluding kimchi (a
traditional fermented Korean dish prepared with cabbage, radishes,
onions, and a variety of seasonings) from the primary analyses. We also

intake and total cancer

We stratiﬁed the analyses for the total combined fruit and vegetable
intake and total vegetable intake by BMI ($25 and <25), smoking habits
(never or ever), or history of diabetes or cardiovascular disease at
baseline (yes and no) and tested the statistical signiﬁcance of the cross-
product terms with an effect modiﬁer variable in the multivariable
models by using the likelihood ratio test. We conducted a sensitivity
analysis by excluding cancer cases or cancer deaths that occurred during
the ﬁrst 2 y of follow-up to examine the possibility of reverse causality.
All of the analyses were conducted with SAS version 9.3 (SAS Institute,
Inc.). All P values were 2-sided and were considered to be statistically
signiﬁcant at a level of <0.05.

Results

The mean intake of total fruits and vegetables was 449.0 g/d
(191.8 g/d and 257.2 g/d of total fruit intake and total vegetable
intake, respectively). During the 15.3 y of follow-up for total
cancer incidence and 15.6 y for total cancer mortality among
14,198 men, we ascertained a total of 1343 total cancer cases
and 507 cancer deaths. Compared with men who consumed
<200 g/d of fruits and vegetables combined, men who consumed
$800 g/d were more likely to be educated, perform vigorous
physical activity, and take multivitamins and were less likely to
smoke and have a history of cardiovascular disease or diabetes
(Table 1). Men who consumed larger amounts of total combined
fruits and vegetables tended to consume more total energy,
alcohol, red meat, ﬁsh, dietary calcium, and dietary ﬁber than
men who consumed smaller amounts of fruits and vegetables.

the multivariable-adjusted RR of

We found a signiﬁcant risk reduction of total cancer incidence
only for 600–799 g/d of fruit and vegetable intake combined
(Table 2);
total cancer
incidence that compared 600–799 g/d with <200 g/d of fruit
and vegetable intake combined was 0.80 (95% CI: 0.65, 0.99;
P-trend: 0.67). To minimize the potential inﬂuence of preclinical
disease on diet, we conducted additional analyses after exclud-
ing 67 men who had a cancer diagnosis within the ﬁrst 2 y of
follow-up. The results were similar to the results of the main
analysis (data not shown). No association was found between

combined total fruit and vegetable intake and the risk of total
cancer mortality ($600 to <800 g/d vs. <200 g/d, RR: 0.79; 95%
CI: 0.56, 1.12; P-trend: 0.80).

After excluding kimchi, which comprised 36.9% of the fruit
and vegetable intake (mean intake: 166 g/d), we found no
associations for total cancer incidence or mortality; $ 500 g/d
vs. <100 g/d, RR: 0.96 (95% CI: 0.80, 1.15; P-trend 5 0.94) for
incidence and RR: 0.84 (95% CI: 0.62, 1.14; P-trend 5 0.49) for
mortality. However, when we analyzed the associations between
kimchi intake and total cancer incidence and mortality, we found
signiﬁcant inverse associations (Supplemental Table 1). The
multivariable-adjusted RR of total cancer incidence that compared
300 g/d with <50 g/d of kimchi intake was 0.73 (95% CI: 0.59,
0.91; P-trend: 0.004). For total cancer mortality, the multivariable-
adjusted RRs that compared 50 to <100, 100 to <150, 150 to
<300, and $300 g/d with <50 g/d of kimchi intake were 0.60
(95% CI: 0.45, 0.79), 0.65 (95% CI: 0.51, 0.84), 0.60 (0.46,
0.79), and 0.67 (95% CI: 0.48, 0.94; P-trend: 0.12), respectively.
The age-adjusted Spearman correlation coefﬁcient between kimchi
and non-kimchi vegetable intake was 0.32 (P < 0.001).

total

fruit

Total vegetable intake, but not

intake, was
associated with a reduction in the risk of total cancer incidence
(Table 3); by comparing $500 g/d with <100 g/d of total
vegetable intake, the multivariable-adjusted RR of total cancer
incidence was 0.72 (95% CI: 0.58, 0.90; P-trend: 0.02, model
2). A reduction in the risk of total cancer incidence was
produced between 100 and 199 g/d in the cubic spline curve,
which corresponded to the results from the multivariable
regression analyses (Figure 1A). For total cancer mortality, the
multivariable-adjusted RRs that compared 100 to <200, 200 to
<300, 300 to <500, and $500 g/d with <100 g/d of total
vegetable intake were 0.68 (95% CI: 0.53, 0.88), 0.75 (95% CI:
0.57, 0.98), 0.72 (95% CI: 0.54, 0.95), and 0.67 (95% CI: 0.47,
0.95), respectively (model 2); both multivariable proportional
hazards models (P-trend: 0.09) and the cubic spline curve (P-
nonlinearity: 0.01; Figure 1B) showed a nonlinear relation
between total vegetable intake and total cancer mortality.

We examined whether the associations between total vege-
table intake (Table 4) and combined fruit and vegetable intake

(yes or no).
3 Adjusted additionally for a baseline history of diabetes or cardiovascular disease (yes or no).

(Supplemental Table 2) varied by BMI, smoking habits, or
history of diabetes and cardiovascular disease at baseline. We
found an apparent inverse association between total vegetable
intake and total cancer incidence and mortality among ever-
smokers, whereas no association was found among never-
smokers (P-interactions were 0.04 and 0.01, respectively).
Among ever-smokers, the multivariable-adjusted RRs of total
cancer incidence and mortality that compared $500 g/d with
<100 g/d of total vegetable intake were 0.73 (95% CI: 0.57,
0.93; P-trend: 0.08) and 0.68 (95% CI: 0.46, 0.99; P-trend:

RRs were 0.55 (95% CI: 0.28, 1.07; P-trend: 0.09) and 0.58
(95% CI: 0.21, 1.59; P-trend: 0.23), respectively. We found that

the associations between total combined fruit and vegetable
intake and total cancer incidence or mortality did not vary by
these characteristics.

In the site-speciﬁc analysis of common cancers in Korea
(stomach, colorectal, liver and bile duct, and lung cancers), we
did not observe a statistically signiﬁcant inverse association of
total combined fruit and vegetable intake with any speciﬁc
cancer incidence or mortality (Supplemental Table 3).

Discussion

In this prospective study of Korean middle-aged men, we
observed that vegetable intake was linearly associated with a

associated with a lower risk of total cancer mortality. However,
our results did not support a possible beneﬁt of fruit intake in
preventing total cancer. We evaluated the total combined fruit
and vegetable intake and the association with subtypes of major
cancers and found no signiﬁcant inverse associations. However,
because of the small number of deaths, our study might lack
sufﬁcient statistical power to detect a true association. The
results of the present study should be interpreted with caution,
and further studies with larger sample sizes and that include
women are needed to conﬁrm these results.

lycopene, dithiolethiones,

Fruit and vegetable intake is considered to be a likely
protective factor against cancer because of the large number
of beneﬁcial bioactive compounds in fruits and vegetables,
including carotenoids, vitamins C and E, selenium, folic acid,
b-carotene,
isothiocya-
nates, ﬂavonoids, allium compounds, isoﬂavones, protease
inhibitors, and dietary ﬁber. These components may protect
cells against carcinogenesis through antioxidant activity,
modulating the detoxiﬁcation enzymes, stimulating the im-
mune system, transferring the methyl groups in the DNA
methylation, modulating steroid hormone metabolism, and
antiproliferative effects (25, 26).

indoles,

A few prospective studies have examined the association
between total fruit and vegetable intake and total cancer risk(5–
8, 27). The European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and
Nutrition study showed a signiﬁcant linear association but with
a small reduction in the risk of total cancer incidence associated
with total vegetable intake [RR for Q5 ($307 g/d) vs. Q1

(<97 g/d): 0.93; P-trend: <0.001] (5). A similar association was
observed for the association between fruit intake and total
cancer incidence [RR for top quintile ($367 g/d) vs. bottom
quintile (<90 g/d): 0.94; P-trend: 0.006]. In the NIH-AARP Diet
and Health Study, elderly men who consumed large quantities of
vegetables had a slightly lower risk of total cancer incidence than
elderly men who consumed low quantities [RR for top quintile
(1.10–3.25 cup equivalents/1000 kcal) vs. bottom quintile
(<0.44 cup equivalent/1000 kcal): 0.94; P-trend: 0.004] (27).
In this study, fruit intake was not associated with total cancer
risk among men. However, other cohort studies conducted in
Japan, Sweden, and the United States did not ﬁnd any signiﬁcant
associations between total fruit and vegetable intake and total
cancer risk, regardless of whether the intakes were evaluated
separately or combined (6–8). We found that total vegetable
intake was linearly associated with total cancer risk. Several
characteristics of our population may differ from Western
populations, such as low BMI, high rate of smoking, and low red
meat intake, which could yield a clear inverse association with
total vegetable intake, as we observed here. This ﬁnding
warrants further studies. In addition, the differences in the types
and number of food items included in the FFQs, ethnicity, the
proportion of supplement use, measurement error, and the
potential presence of residual or unmeasured confounding factors
could be considered.

A few prospective studies reported the association between total
fruit or total vegetable intake with the risk of cancer mortality. Two
prospective studies have shown that higher vegetable intake
conferred an 8% (12) to 70% (11) lower risk of total cancer

mortality with a linear association. In addition, the European
Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition study found a
10% lower risk of cancer mortality with intake of raw vegetables
but not with cooked vegetables (13). The Shanghai WomenÕs and
MenÕs Health Study (10) reported no evidence of this association. A
study in Japan (12) found a signiﬁcant inverse association between
total fruit intake and cancer mortality, but studies conducted in
China (10) or Europe (13) did not.

We found a lower risk of total cancer incidence and mortality
with kimchi intake. Although the antimutagenic and anticarci-
nogenic effects of kimchi were reported in both in vitro and in
vivo studies (28–31), the effect of kimchi on cancer prevention
remains equivocal because of limited evidence from clinical
trials or epidemiologic studies.

The strengths of this study include the use of a prospective
cohort design and the long follow-up period. The consistent results
between the main analysis and the secondary analysis, excluding
diagnosed cancer cases within the ﬁrst 2 y of follow-up, suggest
that reverse causality is unlikely. We included a Korean population
that consumes many vegetables (32), allowing a large contrast
between total fruit and vegetable intake. To the best of our
knowledge, this investigation is the ﬁrst prospective study to
examine the association of fruit and vegetable intake and total
cancer risk and mortality in Korean middle-aged men. This study
has several limitations. First, we cannot rule out the possibility that
random measurement errors inherent in dietary assessment could
have attenuated the association, although fruit and vegetable
intake was investigated with a validated FFQ. Second, because
dietary intake was assessed only at baseline, any changes in dietary
intake during the follow-up period were unknown, and measuring
long-term usual intake may not be as accurate as the cumulative
average dietary intake (33). However, the average total fruit
and vegetable consumption measured in our study was similar to

1254 Choi et al.

the consumption in middle-aged men in the Korea Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (34), a nationwide dietary survey
conducted among a representative sample of Korean adults. Third,
although we attempted to adjust for important confounders, we
could not rule out the possibility that residual or unmeasured
confounding factors may exist. However, a more pronounced
inverse association among nonsmokers, albeit not statistically
signiﬁcant possibly due to small sample size, compared with past or
current smokers may suggest the possibility of minimal residual
confounding variables that may explain the observed inverse
association between total combined fruit and vegetable intake and
total cancer risk. Although red meat intake was not a confounding
factor in the association between total fruit and vegetable intake
and the risks of total cancer incidence and mortality, we cannot rule
out the possibility that the weak association observed for >800 g/d
could be partially explained by the residual effect of risk factors
correlated with fruit and vegetable intake. Finally, this study
consisted of middle-aged men; therefore, the results may not
be generalized to women.

In conclusion, our ﬁndings suggest that vegetable intake was
linearly associated with a lower risk of total cancer incidence
but was nonlinearly associated with a lower risk of total cancer
mortality. However, our results did not support the association
between fruit intake and total cancer incidence and mortality.
The ﬁndings from our study need to be corroborated in large
prospective studies and in the Korean female population.

Context Evidence is lacking that a dietary pattern high in vegetables, fruit, and fiber
and low in total fat can influence breast cancer recurrence or survival.
Objective To assess whether a major increase in vegetable, fruit, and fiber intake
and a decrease in dietary fat intake reduces the risk of recurrent and new primary breast
cancer and all-cause mortality among women with previously treated early stage breast
cancer.
Design, Setting, and Participants Multi-institutional randomized controlled trial
of dietary change in 3088 women previously treated for early stage breast cancer who
were 18 to 70 years old at diagnosis. Women were enrolled between 1995 and 2000
and followed up through June 1, 2006.
Intervention The intervention group (n=1537) was randomly assigned to receive a
telephone counseling program supplemented with cooking classes and newsletters that
promoted daily targets of 5 vegetable servings plus 16 oz of vegetable juice; 3 fruit serv-
ings; 30 g of fiber; and 15% to 20% of energy intake from fat. The comparison group
(n=1551) was provided with print materials describing the “5-A-Day” dietary guidelines.
Main Outcome Measures Invasive breast cancer event (recurrence or new pri-
mary) or death from any cause.
Results From comparable dietary patterns at baseline, a conservative imputation analy-
sis showed that the intervention group achieved and maintained the following statis-
tically significant differences vs the comparison group through 4 years: servings of veg-
etables, ⫹65%; fruit, ⫹25%; fiber, ⫹30%, and energy intake from fat, −13%. Plasma
carotenoid concentrations validated changes in fruit and vegetable intake. Through-
out the study, women in both groups received similar clinical care. Over the mean
7.3-year follow-up, 256 women in the intervention group (16.7%) vs 262 in the com-
parison group (16.9%) experienced an invasive breast cancer event (adjusted hazard
ratio, 0.96; 95% confidence interval, 0.80-1.14; P=.63), and 155 intervention group
women (10.1%) vs 160 comparison group women (10.3%) died (adjusted hazard ra-
tio, 0.91; 95% confidence interval, 0.72-1.15; P=.43). No significant interactions were
observed between diet group and baseline demographics, characteristics of the origi-
nal tumor, baseline dietary pattern, or breast cancer treatment.
Conclusion Among survivors of early stage breast cancer, adoption of a diet that
was very high in vegetables, fruit, and fiber and low in fat did not reduce additional
breast cancer events or mortality during a 7.3-year follow-up period.

high in vegetables and fruit and low in
total fat and prevention of cancer pro-
gression has been mixed in epidemio-
logical studies.3-17 An interim analysis
of data from the Women’s Interven-
tion Nutrition Study (WINS), which as-
sessed the effect of a dietary interven-
tion designed to reduce fat intake on
relapse-free survival in breast cancer pa-
tients,18 found that the intervention was
associated with a marginally statisti-
cally significant improvement in re-
lapse-free survival. To our knowledge,
no other clinical trials investigating di-
etary change and breast cancer sur-
vival have been reported.

The Women’s Healthy Eating and
Living (WHEL) Study was a random-
ized trial assessing whether a dietary
pattern very high in vegetables, fruit,
and fiber and low in fat reduces the risks
of recurrent and new primary breast
cancer and all-cause mortality among
women with previously treated early
stage breast cancer. The study was based
on the recommendations of a national
committee of experts called to re-
spond to a 1993 challenge grant from
a private philanthropist who believed
that the role of diet in preventing can-
cer progression deserved scientific study
to enable cancer survivors to make de-
cisions without having “to rely on folk-
lore, rumor and hearsay.”19

METHODS
Details of the study design, eligibility
criteria, randomization procedures, and
dietary intervention have been re-
ported previously.20,21 In brief, we com-
pared 2 dietary patterns: an interven-
tion group that was intensively
counseled to adopt a dietary pattern
very high in vegetables, fruit, and fi-
ber and low in fat21 and a comparison
group advised to follow the 5-A-Day
diet.22,23 The study tested primary hy-
potheses of whether the intervention di-
etary pattern was associated with (1) a
longer breast cancer event–free inter-
val and (2) increased overall survival
among women previously treated for
early stage breast cancer. Based on the
6 epidemiological studies that had been
published at the time of the trial de-

sign, we estimated the likely effect size
of this multicomponent diet.20 Follow-
ing Lachin and Foulkes,24 we deter-
mined that a sample size of 3000 would
have 82% power to detect a 19% re-
duction in additional breast cancer
events in the intervention group (ex-
pected comparison group rate=24%)
and a 24% reduction in all cause mor-
tality (expected comparison group
rate=15%).

Participants
Participants were enrolled at 7 study
sites between 1995 and 2000. Eligibil-
ity criteria included diagnosis of a pri-
mary operable invasive breast carci-
noma categorized using American Joint
Committee on Cancer (edition IV) cri-
teria as stage I (ⱖ1 cm), stage II, or stage
IIIA within the past 4 years; age at di-
agnosis between 18 and 70 years; treat-
ment with axillary dissection and total
mastectomy or lumpectomy followed
by primary breast radiation; no cur-
rent or planned chemotherapy; no evi-
dence of recurrent disease or new breast
cancer since completion of initial lo-
cal treatment; and no other cancer in
the past 10 years. Eligible women were
randomly assigned to either the study
dietary pattern or the comparison group
(FIGURE 1). The institutional review
boards at the 7 clinical sites approved
the study protocol and consent forms,
and all participants provided written in-
formed consent.

Dietary Intervention
The intensive intervention was deliv-
ered primarily by telephone counsel-
ing, supplemented with 12 cooking
classes in the first year and monthly
newsletters throughout the study.
Trained counselors21 followed a com-
puter-assisted protocol that was based
on social cognitive theory25 and had 3
phases of decreasing intensity. During
the first phase (3-8 calls in 4-6 weeks),
counselors focused on building self-
efficacy to implement the study tar-
gets, which consisted of daily intake of
5 vegetable servings plus 16 oz of veg-
etable juice, 3 fruit servings, 30 g of fi-
ber, and 15% to 20% of energy intake

from fat. Phase 2 (through 5 months)
focused on self-monitoring and dealt
with barriers to adherence. Phase 3
(through study completion) focused on
retaining motivation for the study di-
etary pattern and preventing setbacks.
During the first year of the interven-
tion, participants received an average
of 18 counseling calls, attended an av-
erage of 4 of 12 offered cooking classes,
and received 12 study newsletters. By
4 years, a key point for assessing long-
term effect, these participants had re-
ceived an average of 31 calls and 48
newsletters.

Women randomized to the compari-
son group were provided with print ma-
terials (from the US Department of Ag-
riculture26 and the National Cancer
Institute22,23) describing a diet with a
recommended daily intake of 5 serv-
ings of vegetables and fruit, more than
20 g of fiber, and less than 30% total
energy intake from fat. The compari-
son group attended an average of 1 of
4 offered cooking classes in the first year
and received 24 newsletters tailored to
the comparison group during the first
4 years.

Data Collection
Dietary Assessment. Dietary intake was
assessed by sets of 4 prescheduled 24-
hour dietary recalls conducted by tele-
phone on random days over a 3-week
period, stratified for weekend vs week-
days.20 These dietary recalls were sched-
uled for all participants at baseline, 1
year, 4 years, and 6 years and on 50%
random samples at 6, 24, and 36 months.
We report data for participants complet-
ing follow-up assessments. We also con-
ducted additional analyses as follows: for
participants who did not complete fol-
low-up assessments we imputed esti-
mates by assuming that they changed di-
etary intake in a manner similar to
comparison group respondents, using
the expectation maximization algo-
rithm in SAS software, version 9.1 (SAS
Institute Inc, Cary, North Carolina).27 As
previously described,20 dietary asses-
sors completed a training program and
used the multipass software-driven re-
call protocol of the Nutritional Data Sys-

tem software (NDS-R, 1994-2006, Uni-
versity of Minnesota, Minneapolis). To
assess overall adherence, we developed
an adherence score.20 A completely ad-
herent participant would score 600
points: 300 points reflected vegetable
consumption and the remaining 300
points were divided equally among fi-
ber, fruit, and energy from fat.

Other Data Collection. We collected
adetailedfamilyhistoryofcanceratbase-
line and used the mutation prevalence
tables from Myriad Genetic Laboratories
(Salt Lake City, Utah)28 to classify fami-
lies with at least a 10% risk of a BRCA1/2
mutation as high-risk. Clinic visits con-
ducted at baseline, 1 year, 2 or 3 years
(randomly determined), 4 years, and 6
years included measured weight and ve-
nipuncture. Separated blood samples
were stored in cryovials in −80°C freez-
ers for later analysis. Participants were
mailed a set of study questionnaires to
complete and bring to each clinic visit,
including a health status questionnaire
with questions on recent physician vis-
its and 2 questionnaires used in the
Women’s Health Initiative: the Personal
Habits Questionnaire,29 which included
a9-itemmeasureofphysicalactivityvali-
dated for our study30 and from which we
calculatedmetabolicequivalenttaskmin-
utes per week,31 and the Thoughts and
FeelingsQuestionnaire,32whichincluded
measures of psychosocial functioning.
Each participant self-reported race/
ethnicity as 1 of 8 categories.

Assessment of Study Outcomes
Primary study end points were (1) the
combined outcome of invasive breast
cancer recurrence or new primary
breast cancer and (2) death due to any
cause. Recurrences were further clas-
sified as local/regional or distant me-
tastasis. Carcinoma in situ was not
counted as a study outcome. The breast
cancer event–free interval was defined
as the time from date of enrollment to
development of a new breast cancer
event. Follow-up time was censored at
the time of the participant’s death, at
the last documented staff contact date,
or at the study completion date (June
1, 2006).

During semiannual telephone inter-
views, clinical site staff queried study par-
ticipants regarding the occurrence of out-
come events, any hospitalization, or new
or existing medical diagnoses. Any re-
port of a breast cancer event or death trig-
gered a confirmation interview and col-
lection of medical records and/or death
certificates. Two independent oncolo-
gists reviewed the medical records (pa-
thology reports and physician notes) to
confirm reported recurrences. In cases
of disagreement, the coordinating cen-
ter pathologist adjudicated the out-
come. Finally, we searched the Na-
tional Death Index using Social Security
number, name, and date of birth.

Statistical Analysis
Participants were randomly assigned to
the intervention or comparison group
using a random permuted-block design
stratified by tumor stage, age, and clini-
cal site. The allocation of participants was

conducted by the clinical site coordina-
tor running the study’s randomization
computer program, which automati-
cally stamped the assigned study group
in the database. An independent data and
safety monitoring committee con-
ducted a blind review of potential post-
randomization exclusions.20

Baseline group comparisons of demo-
graphic, anthropometric, clinical, and
dietary measures were conducted with
2-sided t tests, rank-sum tests, or ␹2
tests. We based the primary analysis of
disease-free survival on the intention-
to-treat principle using time-to-event
methods. A 2-sided log-rank test was
performed with P⬍.041 considered sta-
tistically significant (to account for in-
terim analyses undertaken at the re-
quest of the data and safety monitoring
committee). Both unadjusted and ad-
justed hazard ratios were computed. We
fit a Cox model stratified by stage, age,
and clinical site.

The frequencies of antiestrogen
therapy use and bilateral oophorecto-
mies differed marginally between study
groups at baseline; therefore, these co-
variates were also included in the model.
However, the antiestrogen therapy vari-
able did not satisfy the proportional haz-
ards assumption; hence, the analysis was
stratified by this covariate.33 Thus, the fi-
nal model was stratified by stage of ini-
tial tumor, age at randomization, clini-
cal site, and antiestrogen use and was
adjusted for oophorectomy status.

The a priori analysis plan20 in-
cluded fitting a Cox proportional haz-
ards model to evaluate the effect of the
intervention on key covariates. These
included stage of disease (classified as
I, II, or III), age at randomization (⬍55
years vs ⱖ55 years), hormone recep-
tor characteristics of initial tumor, body
mass index, and years from diagnosis
to randomization. Product terms be-
tween randomization assignment and
indicator variables for covariate cat-
egories were included in Cox regres-

sion models. Interactions between ran-
domization group and each covariate
were formally tested for significance
with likelihood ratio tests. The results
are presented as hazard ratios and 95%
confidence intervals.

In additional analyses, we exam-
ined possible interactions between
study group and the baseline dietary
factors targeted by the intervention
(vegetable, fruit, fiber, and fat in-
takes) to address whether the effects of
the dietary intervention might vary by
baseline intake level.

Analyses were conducted in the sta-
tistics software package R, version 2.3.1
(R Foundation, Vienna, Austria; http:
//www.r-project.org) or SAS, version 9.1.

RESULTS
Recruitment and Baseline
Characteristics
Study staff screened 7572 potential par-
ticipants and randomized 3107 be-
tween March 1995 and November 30,
2000 (Figure 1). There was no differ-
ence in postrandomization exclusions
by study group (9 vs 10). The final
study sample included 1537 women in
the dietary intervention group and 1551
in the study comparison group.

The study end date was June 1, 2006.
Number and frequency of reported phy-
sician visits did not differ significantly
between groups at any point during the
study. We confirmed vital status on the
study end date (Figure 1) for 95% of
the intervention group and 96% of the
comparison group. Breast cancer sta-
tus was confirmed for 96% of the in-
tervention group and 97% of the com-
parison group.

Randomization achieved highly com-
parable groups (TABLE 1) with regard
to demographics (ie, age, minority sta-
tus, and education), breast cancer char-
acteristics (ie, stage, grade, nodal in-
volvement, hormone receptor status,
time from breast cancer diagnosis to
randomization, and eligibility for
BRCA1/2 testing), and treatment (ie,
surgery and radiation). Slight imbal-
ances were observed between groups in
bilateral oophorectomy, antiestrogen
use, and chemotherapy treatment, all

of which favored an intervention effect;
however, no between-group differ-
ence was observed in the percentage of
women who received at least 1 of these
therapies (intervention, 93.6%; com-
parison, 92.3%; P=.12). Fourteen per-
cent of women self-identified as mi-
nority race/ethnicity, and these were
fairly equally divided among African
Americans, Hispanics, and Asian
Americans.20

Dietary Changes Between Groups
In analyses of dietary change, only par-
ticipants without a study end point at
the time of assessment were included.
A high proportion of women com-
pleted the dietary assessments
(TABLE 2). At baseline, no between-
group differences were observed in in-
takes of vegetables, fruit, or fiber or en-
ergy intake from fat, with both groups
consuming a daily mean of more than
7 servings of vegetables and fruit. No

between-group differences were ob-
served in measured mean body weight
or in energy intake.

In the comparison group, consump-
tion of vegetables, fruit, or fiber changed
only modestly over the 6 years follow-
ing randomization, while relative en-
ergy intake from fat increased 13%, re-
flecting an identified secular trend
( J.P.P., V.A.N., L.N., et al, unpub-
lished data, May 2007). In the inter-
vention group, the dietary pattern
changed substantially and a large
(P ⬍ .001) between-group difference
was achieved and maintained for each
dietary target across the 6 years of the
intervention. From no difference at
baseline, the overall adherence score
was 91% higher in the intervention
group at 6 months and remained 61%
higher than the comparison group at 6
years. Details of changes in dietary tar-
gets are presented elsewhere (J.P.P.,
V.A.N., L.N., et al, unpublished data,

May 2007). Using the more conserva-
tive imputed data approach,27 at 1 year,
the intervention group had increased
average total vegetable and fruit in-
take to 12 servings/d. This change in
total vegetable and fruit intake re-
flected a major increase in vegetable in-
take, averaging 7.8 vegetable serv-
ings/d at 1 year and remaining relatively
high at 6 servings/d at the 4-year
follow-up.

At 4 years, relative differences in
mean intake between study groups were
⫹65% for vegetable servings, ⫹25% for
fruit servings, ⫹30% for fiber, and −13%
for energy intake from fat. All differ-
ences were statistically significant at
P⬍.001. Total plasma carotenoid con-
centration, a biomarker of vegetable and
fruit intake, was 73% higher in the in-
tervention group than the comparison
group at 1 year and 43% higher at 4
years, differences that were statisti-
cally significant (P ⬍ .001). In addi-

resenting 256 participants (16.7%) in
the intervention group and 262 par-
ticipants (16.9%) in the comparison
group. The disease-free survival curves
were virtually identical across groups
(FIGURE 2). The unadjusted hazard ra-
tio is presented in Figure 2. The
hazard ratio after adjustment for anti-
estrogen use, oophorectomy status, and
stratification factors (including tumor
stage, clinic site, and age) at baseline
was 0.96 (95% confidence interval,
0.80-1.14; P=.63). The likelihood ra-
tio test statistics for group interac-
tions with age, body mass index, physi-
cal activity, energy intake, char-
acteristics of the original tumor (in-
cluding hormone receptor status), and
years from diagnosis to study entry were
not significant (TABLE 4). Further-
more, hazard ratios for intervention ef-
fects within covariate strata were not
significant (Table 4).

Overall Mortality
There were 315 deaths reported within
the study period, with 155 (10.1%) in
the intervention group and 160 (10.3%)
in the comparison group (Figure 2).
More than 80% of all deaths were due

to breast cancer (Table 3). The treat-
ment-associated hazard ratio was 0.91
(95% confidence interval, 0.72-1.15;
P=.43) after adjusting for antiestrogen
use, bilateral oophorectomy, and strati-
fication factors. The likelihood ratio test
statistics for the group interactions with
age, body mass index, physical activ-
ity, energy intake, characteristics of the
original tumor (including hormone re-
ceptor status), and years from diagno-
sis to study entry were not statistically
significant, nor were significant effects
of the intervention on mortality ob-
served for any subgroups of women clas-
sified by major covariates (TABLE 5).

Group Effects by Baseline Quartiles
of Dietary Intake
Within each quartile of the targeted di-
etary components, the intervention
group achieved significant change from
baseline (TABLE 6). However, there was
no evidence of a consistent pattern of
an intervention effect for either breast
cancer events or mortality according to
any baseline diet subgroup, and the
findings that are statistically signifi-
cant in 2 of the 40 compared strata are
what one might expect due to chance.

COMMENT
In this randomized trial of a dietary in-
tervention to achieve a substantial change
to a diet very high in vegetables, fruit, and
fiber and low in fat, the risk of develop-
ing additional breast cancer events and
survival were not altered in women pre-
viously treated for early stage disease. No
significant benefit in recurrence was ob-
served overall among population sub-
groups characterized by demographic
characteristics, baseline diet, or initial tu-
mor types. Although breast cancer mor-
tality rates in the United States declined
during the study period,35 the similarity
in survival patterns between the WHEL
Study groups suggests that continued fol-
low-up would not alter the study re-
sults.

It is unlikely that our results were ma-
terially affected by bias in assessing the
main study end points. Follow-up of par-
ticipants was nearly complete and did not
differ between study groups, and we con-
sidered only reports of recurrence and
new primary tumors that were vali-
dated by medical record review. We ob-
served large and sustained between-
group differences in vegetable and fruit
intake, as assessed by self-report and
plasma carotenoid concentrations, a bio-
marker of vegetable and fruit intake. We
also observed significant differences in
fiber and fat intake. Although weight has
been associated with health outcomes,
we observed less than a 1-kg difference
in average weight between WHEL Study
groups at any time point. While psycho-
social factors have been linked with
health outcomes, we found no between-
group differences for depression, social
support, or quality of life during year 1,
when the intervention was most in-
tense.36 Therefore, we believe that our in-
vestigation provides an adequate test of
whether the study dietary pattern (very
high in vegetables, fruit, and fiber and
low in fat) provided an added benefit over
the dietary pattern of the comparison
group women.

Many WHEL Study participants had
likely changed their dietary pattern
since receiving a diagnosis of breast can-
cer37; 75% were consuming at least 5
servings of vegetables and fruit a day

was consuming less than 5 daily serv-
ings of vegetables and fruit at base-
line, despite a major change in dietary
pattern that was specific to the inter-
vention group. Previously, in longitu-
dinal analyses of the comparison group
only, we observed a possible thresh-
old effect on recurrence for low levels
of baseline plasma carotenoid concen-
tration13 and also that a baseline com-
bination of 5 fruits and vegetables a day
and physical activity equivalent to walk-
ing at a moderate pace for 30 minutes,
6 d/wk, was associated with lower mor-
tality.14 However, in this analysis of data
from the randomized trial, a major in-
crease over the 5-a-day dietary pattern
was not associated with reduced breast
cancer events or mortality.

We suggest caution in applying our
findings to groups of women other than
those represented in our study, which
was confined to women who had al-
ready completed initial therapy for
breast cancer and excluded women with
diagnoses after age 70 years and those
with stage 1 tumors smaller than 1 cm.
Also, only 14% of our study popula-
tion was self-identified as from Afri-
can American, Hispanic, and Asian
American racial/ethnic groups.

Our finding that reducing dietary fat
intake did not benefit breast cancer out-
comes appears at odds with the in-
terim analyses from the Women’s In-
tervention Nutrition Study (WINS),
which concluded that reducing di-
etary fat intake was marginally associ-
ated with longer relapse-free survival
of breast cancer patients, an effect most
noted in the subgroup with estrogen-
negative tumors. However, differen-
tial follow-up between intervention and
comparison groups may have influ-
enced the WINS finding.40 Further-
more, the reduced body weight ob-
served only in the intervention group
might partially account for the im-
proved relapse-free survival in WINS.41
In addition, although WINS reported
an 8% to 9% between-group differ-
ence in energy intake from fat main-
tained through 5 years, they reported
a higher rate of missing dietary intake
data in the intervention group. At the

3-year point, data were available for
67% of the intervention group vs 74%
of the comparison group. At 5 years,
data were available for 39% of the in-
tervention group and 44% of the com-
parison group. If even moderate pro-
portions of nonresponders increased
their fat intake, the between-group
effect could well be less than the abso-
lute 4% difference that we observed. Fi-
nally, it is important to note that the
women enrolled in WINS differed from
those in the WHEL trial regarding prog-
nosis following the original diagnosis,
age, and treatment regimen.

Although the WHEL Study’s inter-
vention diet focused mainly on increas-
ing vegetable, fruit, and fiber intake,
there was a significant between-group
difference in fat intake. However, this
difference may not have been sufficient
to test the dietary fat hypothesis ad-
equately. Unlike the changes observed
for intakes of vegetables, fruit and fi-
ber, the smallest dietary fat change was
made by participants in the quartile that
was furthest from the study target at
baseline. Nonetheless, our analyses did
not suggest an effect across quartiles of
fat intake at baseline, nor did our re-
sults indicate an intervention effect in
subgroups defined by hormone recep-
tor status, as was seen in WINS.

The absence of an observed effect on
breast cancer events or all-cause mor-
tality over a 7.3-year follow-up period
in this study does not rule out the pos-
sibility of improved longer-term sur-
vivorship within this cohort. We did not
explore the possibility that increased ex-
ercise and weight loss might benefit
breast cancer survivors. Finally, our
study did not address whether consum-
ing the high–vegetable/fruit/fiber and
low-fat diet of our study intervention
early in life would alter risk of pri-
mary breast cancer.

In conclusion, during a mean 7.3-year
follow-up, we found no evidence that
adoption of a dietary pattern very high
in vegetables, fruit, and fiber and low in
fat vs a 5-a-day fruit and vegetable diet
preventsbreastcancerrecurrenceordeath

early stage breast cancer.

Abstract

Vitamin E (a -tocopherol) plays a key role in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation and has been studied as a

potential chemopreventive agent for prostate cancer. The association of serum vitamin E concentrations with cancer risk

may be modiﬁed by genetic variations in vitamin E–related genes. We examined whether variants in vitamin E–related genes

were associated with risk of prostate cancer in a nested case-control study using 483 prostate cancer cases and 542

matched controls of European ancestry from a large U.S. multicenter trial that had available measurements of serum vitamin

E concentrations and genotyping of 3 genome-wide association study meta-analysis–identiﬁed single-nucleotide polymor-

phisms (SNPs) associated with circulating vitamin E. ORs and 95% CIs were calculated using unconditional

logistic

regression adjusted for age, family history of prostate cancer, and serum total cholesterol. Findings suggest lower prostate

cancer risk for men whose genotypes reﬂect higher vitamin E (i.e., a-tocopherol) status. An SNP (rs964184) near budding-
site selection protein 13 (yeast) (BUD13), zinc ﬁnger protein 259 (ZNF259), and apolipoprotein A5 (APOA5) on 11q23.3 was
signiﬁcantly associated with prostate cancer risk (per-allele OR = 0.75; 95% CI: 0.58, 0.98; P-trend = 0.03). The association

between rs964184 and prostate cancer risk was stronger among homozygous carriers of the minor allele (OR = 0.27; 95%
CI: 0.09, 0.83). Another variant, rs11057830 in scavenger receptor class-B member 1 (SCARB1) on 12p24.31, approached
statistical signiﬁcance (OR = 0.32; 95% CI: 0.10, 1.01, P = 0.05; 2 minor allele copies). This study suggests that
polymorphisms near BUD13/ZNF259/APOA5, involved in vitamin E transport and metabolism, may be associated with lower

risk of prostate cancer. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00002540. J. Nutr. 144: 729–733, 2014.

Introduction

Vitamin E is a fat-soluble micronutrient consisting of 8 forms, a-,
b-, g-, and d- tocopherols and -tocotrienols (1). Some functions of
vitamin E include antioxidative and anti-inﬂammatory activities
(2–7), inhibition of cell proliferation and angiogenesis (8), and
induction of apoptosis (9). Cancer prevention studies with vitamin
E have focused primarily on a-tocopherol, and, although the bio-
logic effects of a-tocopherol have been investigated, our under-
standing of its role in inhibiting carcinogenesis remains incomplete.
Prostate cancer is the most common malignancy and the
second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in U.S. males;
however, the etiology and pathogenesis of prostate cancer remain

poorly understood. The association between circulating vitamin E
and risk of prostate cancer has been inconsistent in 12 prospective
studies, as summarized by Key et al. (10); the majority (n = 8) suggest
a protective association with RRs for high quantiles ranging from
0.49 to 0.85. The RRs for the remaining studies were 0.98, 1.00,
1.06, and 1.40. Furthermore, the association between vitamin E
supplementation and prostate cancer risk has been inconsistent
in randomized trials. Findings from the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-
Carotene Cancer Prevention Study suggest a signiﬁcant 32%
reduction in prostate cancer risk after 6-y trial supplementation
of 50 IU/d a-tocopherol in male smokers (11, 12), which was
supported by a subsequent trial examining 30 mg/d for 8 y (13).
In 2 recent trials, however, a-tocopherol doses of 400 IU/d for ;6
y (3) and 400 IU on alternate days for ;8 y (14) did not prevent
prostate cancer. Several studies suggest that the vitamin E–prostate
cancer association may be limited to smokers (11,15–18), and recently,
genetic variation in oxidative stress regulatory enzymes has been
shown to modify the association of circulating a-tocopherol
with aggressive prostate cancer among current smokers (16).

The association of vitamin E with prostate cancer risk might be
modiﬁed by genetic variations in vitamin E–related genes.

Genetic variants in genes involved in vitamin E transport or
metabolism may be important determinants of potential beneﬁcial
effects of vitamin E supplementation on prostate cancer risk (19).
In our previous genome-wide association studies (GWASs)6, we
identiﬁed regions of the genome that inﬂuence vitamin E bio-
chemical status, providing a framework for investigation of this
membrane-integrated micronutrient that is important in com-
plex chronic diseases, such as prostate cancer (20,21). To our
knowledge, no studies on the association between these GWAS-
identiﬁed vitamin E–associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) (i.e., rs964184, rs2108622, and rs11057830) and devel-
opment of prostate cancer have been published. The purpose of
this study is to examine whether variants in vitamin E–related
genes are associated with risk of prostate cancer.

Materials and Methods

Study participants. The Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian
(PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial was a multicenter, randomized con-
trolled trial of ;155,000 men and women conducted in the United States
to test the efﬁcacy of screening for prostate, lung, colorectal, and ovarian
cancers (22). Enrollment occurred from November 1993 through June
2001. Screening was performed at 10 centers located across the United
States, including the following: 1) Birmingham, Alabama; 2) Denver,
Colorado; 3) Detroit, Michigan; 4) Honolulu, Hawaii; 5) Marshﬁeld,
Wisconsin; 6) Minneapolis, Minnesota; 7) Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; 8)
Salt Lake City, Utah; 9) St. Louis, Missouri; and 10) Washington, DC.
Men in the screening arm received both serum prostate-speciﬁc antigen
(PSA) and digital rectal examination at study entry and then annually for
3 y and continued to receive PSA screening for years 4 and 5. Men with a
positive screening result (PSA > 4 mg/L or digital rectal examination
suspicious for prostate cancer) were referred to their medical care
providers for prostate cancer diagnostic evaluation. All men were
followed from their initial cancer screening to the occurrence of prostate
cancer, loss to follow-up, or death, whichever came ﬁrst. Clinical and
pathologic records, related to diagnostic follow-up of prostate cancer,
were obtained by certiﬁed tumor registrars at each screening center using
a standardized protocol. Aggressive cancers were deﬁned as Gleason
score $ 7 or stage III or IV of the tumor-node-metastasis staging system,
as deﬁned by the American Joint Committee on Cancer, at the time of
diagnosis because of our interest in the more clinically signiﬁcant but less
common aggressive forms of prostate cancer. Participants from a previous
nested case-control study on prostate cancer consisting of Caucasian
men, aged 55–74 y, with no previous history of prostate cancer before
random assignment were included in the present study if they were from
the screened arm of the study trial and had serum a-tocopherol con-
centration measured in provided blood samples (n = 1536 individuals)
(23). For our present analytic cohort, genotype data on vitamin E–related
polymorphisms were available for 483 cases and 542 controls (n = 1025;
97% of those with baseline serum). The institutional review boards of
the U.S. National Cancer Institute and the 10 study centers approved the
trial, and all participants provided written informed consent.

Phenotypic measurements and genotype data. Nonfasting baseline
blood specimens collected at the clinical centers were processed and
frozen within 2 h of blood draw and stored at 270°C. Serum concen-
trations of a-tocopherol were determined using reversed-phase HPLC
with UV detection (24). The estimated CV for a-tocopherol concentra-
tions was 5.8%. Total serum cholesterol was measured enzymatically by
a standard procedure at 37°C on a Hitachi 912 autoanalyzer. Genotyping
for SNPs was conducted previously using the TaqMan assay (Applied

NIH. The SNPs include rs964184 near budding-site selection protein
13 (yeast) (BUD13), zinc ﬁnger protein 259 (ZNF259), and apolipopro-
tein A5 (APOA5) on 11q23.3, rs2108622 in cytochrome p450, family 4,
subfamily F, polypeptide 2 on 19pter-p13.11, and rs11057830 in scavenger
receptor class B member 1 (SCARB1) 12p24.31, which were found to be
associated with higher circulating vitamin E concentrations at the genome-
wide signiﬁcance level in our previous GWAS meta-analysis (19). The
overall completion rate was between 92% and 99%. Details for each
TaqMan assay may be found at http://variantgps.nci.nih.gov.

Statistical methods. Descriptive statistics were calculated for the
characteristics of prostate cancer cases and controls. The genotype
frequencies between the 2 groups were compared using x2 or FisherÕs
exact tests. There were no signiﬁcant deviations from Hardy-Weinberg
equilibrium observed (P > 0.05). Unconditional
logistic regression
models, adjusted for established risk factors of prostate cancer (age and
family history of prostate cancer) and serum concentrations of total
cholesterol, were used to estimate ORs and 95% CIs for the association
of each vitamin E–related SNP with overall prostate cancer risk assuming
an additive mode of inheritance. We adjusted for total cholesterol be-
cause it is well established that vitamin E concentrations are affected by
circulating lipids; inclusion of cholesterol in the models slightly at-
tenuated results, albeit not signiﬁcantly. Additional covariates consid-
ered included BMI, smoking status (never, former, or current smoker),
and history of diabetes. None of the additional covariates markedly
changed the results (<10% change in OR) and therefore were not
included in the ﬁnal parsimonious regression models. Sensitivity analyses
were conducted for aggressive and non-aggressive disease, in which
aggressive disease was deﬁned as Gleason score $ 7 or tumor stage III or
IV (25). The P value for trend was generated by entering the three-level
ordinal variable coded as the number of minor alleles (zero, 1, or 2) as a
single term in the model (i.e., 1 df). To more closely examine the results
of the tests for trend, we also report the ORs by genotype. Because of the
smaller number of cases with 2 copies of the minor allele, those with 1 or
2 copies were combined. In addition, a polygenic score was used to
examine the combined genetic effect of the 3 SNPs. Potential effect
modiﬁcation by smoking status (ever vs. never) and serum a-tocopherol
concentrations (above vs. below median cut point based on the
distribution among controls) was examined using stratiﬁed analyses
and by additionally including an interaction term in the same regression
model that included the SNP and potential effect modiﬁer. All statistical

Results

Among the 1025 men in this study sample, the mean age at study
entry was 64.8 y. A total of 116 (8%) men, 76 cases and 40
controls, reported having a family history of prostate cancer
(Table 1). Cases were also less likely to have a history of diabetes
or to be current smokers. The mean serum a-tocopherol con-
centration was 19 mg/L (44.1 mmol/L). Mean concentrations did
not vary signiﬁcantly between cases and controls.

The associations (per-allele ORs) between each of the 3 vitamin
E–related SNPs (rs964184, rs2108622, and rs11057830) and
prostate cancer risk are summarized in Table 2. The strongest
association was observed for rs964184, located at 11q23.3 (per-
allele OR = 0.75; 95% CI: 0.58, 0.98; P-trend = 0.03). We found
no strong evidence that associations between the 3 SNPs and
prostate cancer differed according to disease status, with risks for
aggressive cancer being similar to those for non-aggressive cancer
(Table 2). The results did not change after further excluding 4 cases
with stage III disease, which may represent non-lethal, local invasion.
Genotype associations for each SNP are reported in Table 3.
Minor allele carriers [i.e., men with 1 or 2 copies of the variant
(G) allele] of rs964184 had lower risks of prostate can-
cer compared with men with the more common genotype (CC)
(OR = 0.79; 95% CI: 0.59, 1.05). This ﬁnding was marginally
not statistically signiﬁcant (P = 0.06). However, homozygous
carriers of the G allele of rs964184 had a substantially reduced
risk of prostate cancer compared with homozygous carriers of
the common C allele (OR = 0.27; 95% CI: 0.09, 0.83). For
rs11057830, on 12q24.31, a marginally signiﬁcant association
was observed; men who carried 2 copies of the variant allele
(AA) had a lower risk of prostate cancer compared with men
with the wild type (GG) (OR = 0.32; 95% CI: 0.10, 1.01; P =
0.05). Although the associations between rs2108622 genotypes
and prostate cancer risk were in the same direction as the other
vitamin E–related SNPs, no signiﬁcant association was observed
(TT vs. CC; OR = 0.75; 95% CI: 0.44, 1.29). The analysis of a
combined genetic effect of the 3 SNPs as a score suggested a
decreased risk for men with 2 or more copies of minor alleles,
with an ORs of 0.25 among men with 4 or more copies;
however, results should be interpreted with caution given the

small number of men who had 4 or more copies of minor alleles
across the 3 SNPs (n = 10).

A signiﬁcant interaction was observed for rs11057830 (P-
interaction = 0.02), with the strongest association observed for
men with baseline serum a-tocopherol below median concentra-
tion values (per-allele OR = 0.71; 95% CI: 0.50, 1.01) (Table 4).
There was no effect modiﬁcation by serum concentrations of
a-tocopherol or smoking status for rs964184 and rs2108622,
partly because of the small sample sizes. The per-allele association
for rs964184 appeared to be stronger among men whose circu-
lating vitamin E concentrations were below the median value at

Discussion

The present study examined whether genetic variants identiﬁed
in our previous GWAS meta-analysis of circulating vitamin E
modiﬁed risk of prostate cancer. Speciﬁcally, we examined the
association between rs964181, rs2108622, and rs11057830 and
prostate cancer risk in a case-control study nested within the
PLCO Cancer Screening Trial. We found that a higher vitamin E
variant in a SNP near the BUD13/ZNF259/APOA5 region
(rs964184) was associated with a decreased risk of prostate
cancer as well as a suggested protective association for homo-
zygous carriers of the higher vitamin E allele (A) of rs11057830
in SCARB1. The cancer-risk associations for these SNPs were
directionally consistent with their relation to circulating vitamin
E (a-tocopherol) (20,21) (i.e., SNPs were associated with higher
concentrations of serum a-tocopherol, an antioxidant, assuming
an additive model in previous GWAS studies).

The mechanisms involved in the potential beneﬁts of vitamin
E in cancer may function at multiple levels. For example, its
antioxidant properties may protect against oxidative damage or
inhibit free radical–mediated lipid peroxidation within lipid-rich
regions of the cell. Alternatively, vitamin E may modify the signal
transduction cascade of proinﬂammatory cytokines through in-
hibition of NF-kb activation (26). Recent studies suggest that
polymorphisms in speciﬁc genes involved in vitamin E trans-
port, metabolism, and molecular action may also be important
determinants for the protective effects of vitamin E supplemen-
tation (16,19,27,28). In the present study, men who carried 2
copies of the minor allele for rs964184 had lower risks of
prostate cancer when compared with men with the wild-type
genotype. These results suggest that the BUD13/ZNF259/APOA5
variant allele may be associated with a reduction in prostate cancer
risk.

However, to our knowledge, no previous study has examined
the association between these GWAS-identiﬁed vitamin E–associated
genetic variants and prostate cancer risk. An association of serum
a-tocopherol and an effect modiﬁcation by polymorphisms in
oxidative stress regulatory enzymes has been reported in relation
to aggressive prostate cancer risk among current smokers (16).
Cigarette smokers with genetic variation in myeloperoxidase (GA
or AA genotypes; genotypes downregulating oxidative stress),
who had high serum a-tocopherol concentrations, had a reduced
risk (OR = 0.34; 95% CI: 0.15, 0.80) (16).

Strengths of the present study include the prospective design
of the PLCO Cancer Screening Trial in which blood samples
were collected years before the development of prostate cancer
and that the analyses were adjusted for established risk factors of
prostate cancer, including age and family history of prostate
cancer. A potential limitation is that our study was based on
older men of European ancestry and may not be generalizable to
younger and ethnically diverse populations. Furthermore, the
men in this analysis came from a highly screened population
with PSA-detected prostate cancer that may not be representa-
tive of all prostate cancers. Because of the limited statistical
power to detect associations among smokers, larger-scale studies
of these and other genetic variants yet to be identiﬁed that may
inﬂuence a-tocopherol concentrations may help reliably deter-
mine their association with prostate cancer risk among current
smokers.

In summary, we found that an SNP near the BUD13/
ZNF250/APOA5 region was associated with lower prostate
cancer risk among men of European ancestry. The association
for a second SNP, rs11057830 in SCARB1, was restricted to men
who had low serum a-tocopherol concentrations at study baseline.
These ﬁndings support the hypothesis that the variant allele may
enhance antioxidant enzyme activity or other functions; however,
more research is needed to substantiate this ﬁnding.

in  1985 

Background:  Epidemiologic  evidence  indicates  that  diets
high 
in  fruits  and  vegetables  are  associated  with  a
reduced  risk  of  several  cancers,  including  cancers  of  the
esophagus  and  stomach.  Vitamins  and  minerals  in  these
foods  may  contribute  to  the  reduced  cancer  risk.  The
people  of  Linxian  County,  China,  have  one  of  the  world's
highest  rates  of  esophageal/gastric  cardla  cancer  and  a
persistently  low  intake  of  several  micronutrients.  Pur-
pose:  We  sought  to  determine  if  dietary  supplementation
with  specific  vitamins  and  minerals  can  lower  mortality
from  or  incidence  of  cancer  as  well  as  mortality  from
other  diseases  in  Linxian.  Methods:  Individuals  of  ages
40-69  were  recruited 
four  Linxian
communes.  Mortality  and  cancer  incidence  during  March
1986-May  1991  were  ascertained  for  29584  adults  who
received  daily  vitamin  and  mineral 
supplementation
throughout  this  period.  The  subjects  were  randomly
assigned  to  intervention  groups  according  to  a  one-half
replicate  of  a  24  factorial  experimental  design.  This
design  enabled  testing  for  the  effects  of  four  combina-
tions  of  nutrients:  (A)  retinol  and  zinc;  (B)  riboflavin  and
niacin;  (C)  vitamin  C  and  molybdenum;  and  (D)  beta
carotene,  vitamin  E,  and  selenium.  Doses  ranged  from
one  to  two  times  U.S.  Recommended  Daily  Allowances.
Results:  A  total  of  2127  deaths  occurred  among  trial
participants  during  the  intervention  period.  Cancer  was
the  leading  cause  of  death,  with  32%  of  all  deaths  due  to
esophageal  or  stomach  cancer,  followed  by  cerebrovascu-
lar  disease  (25%).  Significantly  (P  =  .03)  lower  total
mortality  (relative  risk  [RR]  =  0.91;  95%  confidence
interval  [CI]  =  0.84-0.99)  occurred  among  those  receiving
supplementation  with  beta  carotene,  vitamin  E,  and

selenium.  The  reduction  was  mainly  due  to  lower  cancer
rates  (RR  =  0.87;  95%  CI  =  0.75-1.00),  especially
stomach  cancer  (RR  =  0.79;  95%  CI  =  0.64-0.99),  with
the  reduced  risk  beginning  to  arise  about  1-2  years  after
the  start  of  supplementation  with  these  vitamins  and
minerals.  No  significant  effects  on  mortality  rates  from
all  causes  were  found  for  supplementation  with  retinol
and  zinc,  riboflavin  and  niacin,  or  vitamin  C  and
molybdenum.  Patterns  of  cancer  incidence,  on  the  basis
of  1298  cases,  generally  resembled  those  for  cancer
mortality.  Conclusions:  The  findings  indicate  that  vitamin
and  mineral  supplementation  of  the  diet  of  Linxian
adults,  particularly  with  the  combination  of  beta  car-
otene,  vitamin  E,  and  selenium,  may  effect  a  reduction  in
cancer  risk  in  this  population.  Implications:  The  results
on  their  own  are  not  definitive,  but  the  promising
findings  should  stimulate  further  research  to  clarify  the
potential  benefits  of  micronutrient  supplements.  [J  Natl

Linxian,  a rural  county  in  Henan  Province  of  north-central
China,  has  one  of  the  world's  highest  rates  of  esophageal
cancer  (7).  Mortality  rates  from  this  cancer  exceed  the
Chinese  national  average  by  10-fold  and  the  American
average  for  Whites  by  100-fold  (2).  The  tumors  arise  not
only  as  squamous  cell  carcinomas  in  the esophagus,  but  also
beyond  the  esophageal-gastric  junction  as  adenocarcinomas
in  the  cardia  region  of  the  stomach.  Historically,  esophageal
and  gastric  cardia  cancers  have  been  considered  as  a  single

Table  1.  Types  and  daily  doses  of  micronutrients  by  treatment  factor

Reasons  for  the  clustering  of  esophageal-gastric  cardia
cancer  in  Linxian  are  unknown;  case-control  studies  (3,4)
have  failed  to  detect  strong  dietary  or  other  risk  factors.  A
number  of  investigations  (5)  conducted  in  other  areas  of  the
world  have  found  that  consumption  of  fresh  vegetables  and
fruits  is  associated  with  a  reduced  risk  of  both  esophageal
and  stomach  cancers.  The  particular  constituents  of  vegeta-
bles  and  fruits  responsible  for  the  protective  effect  have  not
been  determined,  but 
trends  have  been  shown
between  cancer  risk  and 
intake  of  several
micronutrients  found  in  these  foods,  especially  vitamin  C
and  beta  carotene

Food  availability  and  variety  in  Linxian  have  historically
been  limited.  Although  completion  of  a  massive  agricultural
irrigation  system  in  1965  resulted  in  increased  production  of
several  foods,  diets  typically  have  remained  low  in  intake  of
fresh  fruits  and  meat  and  other  animal  products.  The  major
staples  are  corn,  millet,  sweet  potatoes,  and  wheat.  In
surveys  {8-11)  of  Linxian  residents  during  the  1970s  and
early  1980s,  blood  levels  of  various  micronutrients,  includ-
ing  retinol,  beta  carotene,  riboflavin,  vitamin  C,  and  vitamin
E  were  consistently 
low  by  Western  standards,  although
overt  clinical  deficiencies  were  not  common.

subclinical

multiple  vitamins  and  minerals  might  reduce  the  rates  of
cancer.  One  trial  involved  approximately  3300  participants
with  esophageal  dysplasia  and  is  the  subject  of  another
article  in  this  issue  of  the  Journal  (12).  In  this  presentation,
we  describe  results  from  a  larger  trial 
involving  nearly
30000  residents  from  the  high-risk  Linxian  general  popula-
tion.  We  present  tests  of  the  initial  effectiveness  of  four
specific  combinations  of  vitamins  and  minerals  in  reducing
cancer  incidence  and  mortality  as  well  as  mortality  from
other  diseases  during  the  course  of  the  intervention.

While  a  separate  evaluation  of  each  of  the  nine,  and  perhaps  additional,
nutrients  listed  in  Table  1  would  have  been  desirable,  a  29  or  higher
factorial  experiment  was  impractical.  The  feasible  options  were  to  delete
certain  nutrients  or  to  combine  them  into  a  smaller  number  of  groups.  We
chose  the  latter  approach,  combining  zinc,  which  enhances  the  delivery  of
retinol  to  tissues,  and  retinol  (Factor  A);  the  B  vitamins  riboflavin  and
niacin  (Factor  B);  vitamin  C  and  molybdenum,  which  are  thought  to  inhibit
the 
formation  of  carcinogenic  nitrosamines  and  nitrosamine-induced
esophageal  carcinogenesis,  respectively  (Factor  C);  and  the  fat-soluble
antioxidants  beta  carotene,  vitamin  E,  and  selenium  (Factor  D). A  fractional
factorial  design  was  selected  because  it  permitted  testing  of  the  main
effects  of  four  factors  at  less  cost  and  complexity  than  a  full  24  factorial
design.  The  eight  intervention  groups  in  this  fractional  design  were  defined
by  the  following  combinations  of  supplements:  AB,  AC,  AD,  BC,  BD,  CD,
ABCD,  or  placebo.  Thus,  persons  in  group  AB,  e.g.,  received  retinol,  zinc,
riboflavin,  and  niacin,  while  those  in  group  ABCD  received  all  nine
vitamins  and  minerals  and  those  in  the  placebo  group  received  none.  This
choice  of  groups  resulted  in  half  the  participants  receiving  each  of  the  four
factor  nutrient  combinations.  For  example,  half  received  factor  A  (AB,  AC,
AD,  ABCD)  and  half  did  not  (BC,  BD,  CD,  placebo),  and  the  subjects  that
received  versus  those  that  did  not  receive  factor  A  were  balanced  with
respect  to  receipt  of  all  other  nutrients.

The  eight  vitamin/mineral  combinations  were  packaged  in  coded  bottles
containing  a  1-month  supply  and  were  distributed  monthly  by  approx-
imately  200  village  doctors  beginning 
in  March  1986  and  continuing
through  May  1991.  Compliance  was  assessed  in  two  ways:  by  counting
unused  pills  and  by  assaying  nutrient 
from

3  months  during  the  course  of  the  trials.

Subjects  and  Methods

Participants  in  the  trial  were  recruited  in  1985  from  four  communes  in
Linxian.  Residents  aged  40-69  years  without  debilitating  diseases  or  prior
esophageal  or  stomach  cancer  who  were  willing  to  take  part  in  a  multiyear,
daily  pill-taking  regimen  were  sought  for  enrollment.  These  individuals
were  given  a  brief  physical  examination,  had  a  10-mL  blood  sample
collected  and  stored,  and  were  interviewed  regarding  aspects  of  their
medical,  family,  dietary,  and  tobacco  and  alcohol  consumption  histories.
The  participants  were  randomly  assigned  to  receive  one  of  eight  vitamin/
mineral  supplement  combinations  in  the  form  of  individual  oral  tablets.  The
treatment  combinations  were  randomly  assigned  within  blocks  defined  by
commune  (four  communes),  sex,  and  age  (by  single  years).  The  eight
intervention  groups  were  derived  from  a  one-half  replicate  of  a  2*  factorial
design  (13).  The  factorial  design  allowed  us  to  assess  four  factors  (i.e.,
nutrient  combinations)  in  a  single  experiment.  The  four  factors,  which  we
designate  by  the  letters  A,  B,  C,  and  D,  are  defined  in  Table  1.  Doses  of
each  nutrient  ranged  from  one  to  two  times  U.S.  Recommended  Daily
Allowances  (RDAs).

in  this  population,  resulted  in  essentially  no  change  and  is  not  presented.

allowed  for  a  latency  period  before  a  treatment  effect  might  occur.  Tests
for  pairwise  interactions  between  factors  were  able  to  be  calculated,  but
with  the  fractional  design,  only  three  of  the  six  two-way  interactions  could
be  evaluated.  Furthermore,  because  the  interaction  between  any  two  of  the
four  factors,  say  A  and  B,  is  mathematically  equivalent  to  the  interaction
between  the  remaining  two  factors  (i.e.,  C  and  D),  interactive  effects  for
one  pair  cannot  be  distinguished  from  the  other.  Thus,  these  tests  were  not

mortality  and  incidence  by  calendar  quarter  throughout  the  study  period.
All  P  values  associated  with  comparisons  of  those  receiving  versus  those
not  receiving  a  particular  vitamin/mineral  factor  are  nominal  and  based  on
two-sided  tests,  even  though  one-sided  tests  would  have  been  appropriate
because  of  the  a  priori  hypotheses  of  beneficial  effects  of  the  supplements.

Results

Of  the  approximately  50000  potentially  eligible  partici-
pants,  16% refused  to  participate,  12%  were  out  of  the  area,
3%  were  too  sick,  and  8%  did  not  join  the  trial  for  other
reasons.  In  addition,  1.4%  were  excluded  due 
to  self-
reported  cancer  at  screening  or  death  or  diagnosis  of  cancer
prior  to  the  start  of  intervention.  After  these  exclusions,  the
study  population  consisted  of  29584  randomly  assigned
participants.  Characteristics  of  these  individuals  are  given  in
Table  2.  The  various  treatment  groups  were  well  balanced
with  regard  to  sex,  age,  smoking,  alcohol  consumption,  and
diet  and  familial  cancer  history.

Compliance  assessed  by  monthly  pill  counts  and  bio-
chemical  measures  was  excellent  throughout  the  study.  The
overall  pill  disappearance  rate  was  93%  for  all  participants,
with  no  difference  by  treatment  group  (range,  92%-93%)  and
little  change  during  the  trial  (range,  92%-93%  in  year  1;

A  total  of  2127  deaths  (7.2%  of  the  study  participants)
occurred  during  the  period  March  1986-May  1991.  The

women  (5.5%)  and  rose  with  age  at  start  of  follow-up  (2.3%
age  <50,  7.3% age  50-59,  and  17.3% age  5=60). Cancer  was
the  leading  cause  of  death,  accounting  for  37% of  all  deaths.
Of  the  792  cancer  deaths,  87%  (or  32%  of  all  deaths)  were
attributed 
the  esophagus  (360  deaths)  or
stomach  (331  deaths;  253  from  gastric  cardia  and  78  from

95%  CI  = 0.84-0.99)  among  those  receiving  factor  D.  Cancer
mortality  among  this  group  was  reduced  13%  (RR  =  0.87;
95%  CI  =  0.75-1.00),  with  esophageal/gastric  cardia  rates
reduced  10%  (RR  =  0.90;  95%  CI  =  0.77-1.05).  The
decrease  in  cancer  mortality  among  those  receiving  beta
carotene,  vitamin  E,  and  selenium  was  more  pronounced  for
stomach  (RR  =  0.79)  and  other  (RR  =  0.80)  cancers  than  for
esophageal  cancers  (RR  =  0.96),  but  differences  between
these  RRs  were  not  significant  (/>>.10).  The  lower  risk  for
those  receiving  factor  D  was  seen  for  both  cardia  (RR  =
0.82)  and  noncardia  (RR  =  0.72)  stomach  cancers.  When  a
1-year  lag  (to  allow 
to
become  apparent)  was  incorporated 
into  the  proportional
hazards  regression  analysis,  the  differences  between  those
receiving  versus  those  not  receiving  beta  carotene,  vitamin
E,  and  selenium  became  slightly  more  pronounced:  The  RR
for  total  cancer  mortality  was  0.85  (95% CI  = 0.73-0.98);  for
stomach  cancer,  it  was  0.77  (95%  CI  =  0.61-0.98).  This  lag

from  total  cancer  and  stomach  cancer  by  calendar  quarter  for
those  receiving  versus  those  not  receiving  beta  carotene,
vitamin  E,  and  selenium.  Cancer  rates  overlapped  until
approximately  1  year  (total  cancer;  Fig.  1)  or  2  years
(stomach  cancer;  Fig.  2)  after  the  start  of  the  intervention
and  then 
tended  to  diverge.  None  of  the  other  factors
showed  a  progressive  benefit  of  the  kind  seen  in  Figs.  1 or
2.  Mortality  from  noncardia  stomach  cancer  was  signifi-
cantly  (f  =  .02)  lower  among  those  receiving  retinol  and
zinc,  but  cardia  cancer  rates  were  elevated  and  there  was  no
overall  reduction  in  stomach  cancer  death  rates  in  this  group.
Patterns  for  cancer  incidence  resembled  those  for  cancer
mortality  (Table  6).  In  total,  1298  persons  were  diagnosed
with  cancer  during  the  study  period.  Among  these  diagnoses,
49%  were  esophageal  cancer,  42%  were  stomach  cancer
(34%  cardia  and  8%  for  noncardia  cancers),  and  9%  were
other  cancers.  As  with

Discussion

The  findings  from 

trial  provide
support  for  the  hypothesis  that  intake  of  specific  micro-

this  large  randomized 

in  cancer  mortality  and 

nutrients  may  inhibit  cancer  development.  Reductions  in
total  mortality  and 
incidence,
especially  for  stomach  cancer,  were observed  over  a  5'/4-year
period  for  the  nearly  15000  individuals  who  received  daily
supplements  containing  beta  carotene,  vitamin  E,  and
selenium.  A  reduction  in  esophageal  cancer  incidence  was
also  suggested  among  those  receiving  riboflavin  and  niacin.
No  other  nutrient  combination  demonstrated  any  clear
beneficial  effects  on  cancer  rates.

intervention  groups  guaranteed  equity  between 

nutrients  and  an  extraordinarily  high  incidence  of  epithelial
cancers  thought  to  be  influenced  by  diet  and  nutritional
status.  The  random  allocation  within  strata  of  individuals  to
the 
the
groups  by  age  and  sex,  facilitated  balance  with  respect  to
unmeasured  factors,  and  helped  to  avoid  confounding.  The
participant  compliance  was  exceptional:  Pill  disappearance
(implying  apparent 
ingestion)  exceeded  90%,  and  blood
collections  from  randomly  selected  individuals  every  quarter
provided  biochemical  confirmation  of  excellent  compliance.
The  large  numbers  of  events—over  2100  deaths  and  nearly
1300  cancers—yielded  excellent  power  and  precise  estima-

There  are  several  caveats,  however, 

that  should  be
considered  in  interpreting  the  trial  findings.  Some  concern
the  study  design.  An  advantage  of  the  factorial  design  is  the
ability  to  test  several  hypotheses  simultaneously.  However,
with  four  independent  tests  of  main  effects,  the  chance  that
one  will  be  significant  at  the  P=£.03  level  is  .11  (i.e.,  1  -
.974)  as  a  result  of  the  multiple  comparisons.  Secondly,  the
fractional  factorial  design  confounds  main  effects  with  three-
way  interaction  effects,  so  what  we  attribute  to  factor  D
might  actually  be  an  ABC  interaction.  Such  interactions  are
typically  rare  and  seem  much  less  likely  than  an  effect  due
to  a  single  factor,  however,  and  can  likely  be  dismissed.
Finally, 
the  Linxian  setting,  a
relatively  remote,  rural  area  of  China  with  a  population
marginally  deficient 
in  a  number  of  nutrients,  suggest
caution  in  extrapolating  the  findings  to  other  populations.

mortality  from  stomach  cancer  (21%  reduction)  and  other

(20%  reduction)  versus  esophageal  cancer  (4%

Studies  in  experimental  animals  (6,7)  have  demonstrated
the  cancer  inhibitory  properties  of  beta  carotene,  vitamin  E,

and  selenium.  For  example,  beta  carotene  has 
inhibited
formation  of  UV-induced  skin  cancers,  oral  carcinomas
caused  by  dimethylbenzanthracene  exposure,  and  colon
tumors  that  develop  following  dimethylhydrazine  exposure.
Vitamin  E  and  selenium  have  also  lowered  the  incidence  of
tumors  in  a  number  of  experiments  involving  exposure  to
different  carcinogens,  although  some  studies  (6,7)  suggested
either  no effect  or  enhancement  of  carcinogenesis.  Vitamin  E
has  been  shown  to  inhibit  nitrosamine-induced  esophageal
cancer  in  mice  (75).

The  epidemiologic  evidence 

is  also  consistent  with  a
beneficial  role  of  beta  carotene,  vitamin  E,  and  selenium  on
cancer  risk  (5,6).  It  has  repeatedly  been  shown  that  intake  of
fresh  fruits  and  vegetables  is  associated  with  reduced  risks
of  esophageal,  stomach,  and  total  cancer  (5).  Risks  among
persons  having  the  highest  intakes  often  are  as  low  as  one
half  of  those  having  the  lowest  intakes  for  several  foods,
especially  citrus  and  other  fruits  and  fresh  green,  orange,  and
yellow  vegetables.  Although  it  has  been  difficult  to  identify
specific  components  of  these  foods  that  may  be  responsible
for  the  decreased  risk,  a  role  for  beta  carotene  and  possibly
other  carotenoids  has  been  suggested  by  case-control  studies
of  esophageal  and  stomach  cancers,  including  studies  in
China  (5,6,16-18).  Difficulty  in  estimating  dietary  intakes  of
vitamin  E  and  selenium  has  limited  evaluation  of  their
effects.  However,  in  Italy,  the  largest  case-control  study  (19)
of  stomach  cancer  conducted  to  date  found  that  risks  of
cancers  of  the  stomach,  including  gastric  cardia,  were  more
closely  correlated  with  an  index  of  dietary  vitamin  E  than  of
beta  carotene,  although  the  opposite  pattern  was  reported  in
Canada  (20).

Further  supporting  evidence  for  a  protective  effect  of  beta
carotene,  vitamin  E,  and  selenium  comes  from  observations
of  inverse  associations  of  blood  levels  of  these  nutrients  with
risk  of  several  cancers,  including  those  of  the  esophagus  and
stomach.  Ecologic  surveys  (21-23)  across  rural  Chinese
counties  found  that  plasma  levels  of  selenium  were  inversely
correlated  with  mortality  rates  for  both  esophageal  and
stomach  cancers,  while  plasma  beta  carotene  was  signifi-
cantly  lower  in  counties  with  high  stomach  cancer  rates.  In
Linxian,  blood  levels  of  beta  carotene  and  alpha-tocopherol
are  consistently  lower  than  Western  norms,  while  levels  of
selenium  are  near  normal  or  only  marginally  lower  (8-11).  In

Only  a  few  observational  studies  have  evaluated  risk  of
cancer  in  relation  to  use  of  vitamin  or  mineral  supplements.
In  a  U.S.  hospital-based  study  (26)  of  133  male  esophageal
cancer  patients,  risk  was  50%  lower  among  users  of  vitamin
E  supplements.  A  50%  reduction  in  risk  of  oral  cancer  also
was  reported  among  users  of  vitamin  E  supplements  in  a
national  study 
that  enrolled  over  1000  American
patients.

(27) 

Several  clinical  trials  have  shown  beneficial  effects  of
beta  carotene  or  vitamin  E  on  precancerous  lesions.  In  a  20-
month  randomized  trial  in  Uzbekistan  (28),  daily  doses  of  40
mg  of  beta  carotene  together  with  weekly  supplements  of
100000  IU  of  retinol  and  80  mg  of  vitamin  E  were
associated  with  endoscopically  determined  regression  of
chronic  esophagitis  (although  the  effect  was  not  statistically
significant) 
in  oral
leukoplakia.  Several  other  trials  (29-31)  have  also  reported
reversals  in  oral  leukoplakia,  thought  to  be  a  precursor  to
oral  cancer,  following  supplementation  with  beta  carotene  or
vitamin  E.  Furthermore,  beta  carotene  combined  with  retinol
lowered  the  frequency  of  buccal  micronuclei  among  betel
chewers  in  the  Philippines  (32),  while  beta  carotene  alone
reduced  the  prevalence  of  micronuclei 
in  the  sputum  of
smokers  in  the  Netherlands  (55).

No  other  randomized  clinical  trials  have  reported  on  the
effects  on  esophageal  or  stomach  cancers  of  supplementation
with  beta  carotene,  vitamin  E,  or  selenium.  In  the  only
reported  cancer 
(34),  daily  50-mg  beta  carotene
supplementation  was  not  found  to  be  effective  in  inhibiting
second  primary  basal  or  squamous  cell  skin  cancers  among
patients  with  nonmelanoma  skin  cancer.  In 
the  smaller
parallel 
that  we  conducted  among  persons  with
esophageal  dysplasia  in  Linxian,  described  in  a  companion
paper  (12),  total  cancer  mortality  and  incidence  rates  were
similar  between  those  receiving  6  years  of  supplementation
with  26  vitamins  and  minerals  (including  beta  carotene,
vitamin  E,  and  selenium)  and  those  receiving  placebo.  Inter-
vention  trials  involving  beta  carotene,  vitamin  E,  and/or
selenium  and  assessing  cancer  end  points  are  ongoing  in
populations  in  the  United  States  and  Finland.  Although  the
numbers  of  esophageal  or  stomach  cancers  likely  to  arise  in
these  trials  will  be  considerably  smaller  than  in  Linxian,
evaluation  of  the  effects  of  supplementation  on  these  cancers
should  be  possible.

The  mechanisms  by  which  beta  carotene,  vitamin  E,  or
selenium  inhibit  cancer  development  are  not  clear,  but  might
involve  their  antioxidant  properties  (6).  These  compounds,
especially  beta  carotene,  can  quench  free  radicals  and  protect
against  oxidative  damage  to  DNA.  The  nutrients  also  inhibit
the  endogenous  formation  of  N-nitroso  compounds,  some  of
which  are  potent  carcinogens  in  animal  experiments  and  are

suspected  risk  factors  for  stomach  and  esophageal  cancers  in
human  populations,  including  Linxian's  (35,36).  Beta  car-
otene,  vitamin  E,  and  selenium  may  also  possess  immu-
nologic  and  other  properties  that  influence  carcinogenesis
(6).  We  could  not  directly  evaluate  mechanistic  pathways,

observed  among  those  receiving  retinol  and  zinc,  but  it  was
counterbalanced  by  an  increase 
in  gastric  cardia  cancer

cancer  risk  has  been  postulated  on  the  basis  of  its  role  in
maintaining  cell 
integrity  and  on  the  ability  of  certain
retinoids  to  inhibit  chemically  induced  tumors  in  laboratory
animals,  although  in  some  experimental  models,  vitamin  A

Epidemiologic  support  for  a  beneficial  effect  of  vitamin  A,
although  suggestive  at  one  time,  has  waned  since  the  trial
began.  Several 
found  no
evidence  of  a protective  effect  of  dietary  or  serum  retinol  for
esophageal  or  stomach  cancers,  with  the  consensus  suggest-
ing  that  benefits  are  associated  with  the  vitamin  A  precursor
beta  carotene  (37).  In  clinical  trials  (38),  however,  high
isotretinoin  have  proven

in  oral  cancer  patients.
Although  human  data  on  the  relationship  between  zinc  and
cancer  are  limited,  zinc  was  included  because  it  enhances
delivery  of  retinol  to  body  tissues  and  because  esophageal
carcinogenesis  is  promoted  in  zinc-deficient  rats  (39).  It  is
noteworthy 
that  in  a  randomized  trial  (40)  in  a  county
neighboring  Linxian,  13  months  of  supplementation  with
retinol  (50000  IU  per  week)  and  zinc  (50  mg  per  week)
along  with  high  doses  (200  mg  per  week)  of  riboflavin  had
no  effect  on  the  prevalence  of  precancerous  esophageal
lesions.  The  frequencies  of  buccal  micronuclei  also  were

One  of  the  characteristics  of  areas  of  the  world  (e.g.,
Linxian  and  parts  of  Iran  and  South  Africa)  with  markedly
elevated  esophageal  cancer  rates  is  low  dietary  intake  of  B
vitamins,  particularly  riboflavin  and  niacin  (42).  Indeed,
riboflavin  status  as  measured  by  erythrocyte  glutathione
reductase  activity  was  severely  depressed  in  Linxian  when
compared  with  the  United  States;  over  90%  of  the  Linxian
population  was  termed  deficient 
(8-11).
Riboflavin  deficiencies  have  induced  esophageal  hyperplasia
in  baboons  and  altered 
the  metabolism  of  nitrosamines
(43,44).  Supplementation  with  riboflavin  and  niacin,  along
with  zinc,  magnesium,  and  molybdenum,  inhibited  esopha-
geal  carcinogenesis  in  corn-fed  rats  (45).  In  Uzbekistan,

however,  supplementation  with  riboflavin  for  20  months  was
not  successful 
in  reversing  chronic  esophagitis  (28).  We

statistical  significance.  Total  cancer  incidence  or  mortality,
however,  was  only  slightly  reduced  among  those  receiving  B
vitamin  supplementation,  thus  providing  only  weak  support
for  a  protective  effect.  On  the  other  hand,  the  limited  a
priori  evidence  suggests  that  a  benefit  from  riboflavin  and
niacin  may  be  more  pronounced  for  esophageal  cancer.
Thus,  we  view  the  finding  of  lowered  esophageal  cancer
incidence  as  an  encouraging  sign  worthy  of  additional
investigation.

Vitamin  C  has  been  suggested  as  protective  against
several  cancers,  particularly  stomach  cancer  (6).  Although
results  of  experimental  studies  are  mixed,  most  case-control
studies  of  stomach  and  esophageal  cancers  have  shown  that
adult  diets  of  the  patients  typically  are  low  in  intake  of
vitamin  C-containing

showed  no evidence  of  reduced  cancer  mortality  or  incidence

The  failure  of  this  trial  to  find  significant  reductions  in

focus  on  concurrent  events  in  adults  taking  the  supplements
would  not  be  expected  to  show  a  mortality  differential.  The
data  suggest  only  that  supplementation  with  these  particular
nutrients  resulted  in  no  demonstrable  short-term  mortality
benefit.  Continued  monitoring  of 
the  participants  will
determine  whether  any  reductions  in  cancer  or  other  disease
may  emerge  in  the  coming  years.

from  cerebrovascular  disease  was  10% 

Several  reports  have  suggested  that  antioxidant  nutrients
may  reduce 
the  risk  or  progression  of  cerebrovascular
disease,  a  common  cause  of  death  in  Linxian,  and  perhaps
lower  the  rate  of  hypertension,  a  strong  risk  factor  (6,47-49).
We  found  no  significant  treatment  group  differences,  but
mortality 
lower
among  those  receiving  supplements  with  the  antioxidants

of  antioxidants  on  cerebrovascular  disease  may  be  caused  by
ischemia,

the  coronary  vessels,  by
reducing  the  oxidation  of  low-density  lipoproteins  (50).  A
lowered  risk  of  cardiovascular  disease  has  been  reported
among  American  men  and  women 
taking  vitamin  E
supplements  (51,52).  Furthermore,

among  U.S.  physicians  (53),  beta  carotene  was  found  to

plasma  levels  of  carotene  and  vitamins  E  and  C  have  been
inversely  related  to  risk  of  angina  (54).  Only  1%  of  the
deaths  among  Linxian  trial  participants  were  attributed  to
ischemic  heart  disease,  limiting  evaluation  of  intervention
effects,  but  we  found  little  or  no  reduction  in  mortality  from
cardiovascular  disease  among  those  receiving  beta  carotene,
vitamin  E,  and  selenium.

In  summary,  when 

trial  observations  are
combined  with  the  epidemiologic,  experimental,  and  biolog-
ical  evidence  at  hand,  it  seems  plausible  that  the  lowered
cancer  rates  represent  a  protective  effect  of  beta  carotene,
vitamin  E,  and  selenium  intervention.  Although  pill  supple-
mentation  ceased  in  the  summer  of  1991, continued  follow-
up  of  the  Linxian  participants  over  the  coming  years  is
planned.  In  this  manner,  persistence  of  the  lowered  mortality
associated  with  beta  carotene,  vitamin  E,  and  selenium  and
the  reduced  esophageal  cancer  incidence  associated  with
riboflavin  and  niacin  can  be  evaluated  along  with 
the
potential 
long-term  effects  of  each  of  the  four  nutrient
combinations  after  intervention.  Shorter-term  trials  are  also
planned  in  the  context  of  a  gastric  screening  project  in
another  high-risk  area  of  China  to  assess  the  effectiveness  of
beta  carotene  versus  vitamin  E  versus  selenium  in  inhibiting

results  should  be  considered  preliminary  in  nature,  they  offer

Nutrition  Intervention  Trials  in  Linxian,  China:
Multiple  Vitamin/Mineral  Supplementation,
Cancer  Incidence,  and  Disease-Specific  Mortality
Among  Adults  With  Esophageal  Dysplasia

Background:  A  number  of  vitamins  and  minerals  have
been  shown  to  influence  carcinogenesis  in  experimental
animals.  In  humans,  epidemiologic  evidence  suggests  that
intake  of  fruits  and  vegetables  may  reduce  risk  of
esophageal  and  other  cancers.  Vitamins  and  minerals  in
these  foods  may  contribute  to  the  reduced  cancer  risk.
The  people  of  Linxian,  China,  have  persistently 
low
intake  of  multiple  nutrients  and  exhibit  one  of  the
world's  highest  rates  of  esophageal/gastric  cardia  cancer,
with  an  exceptionally  high  risk  of  esophageal  dysplasia.
Purpose:  To  determine  whether  supplementation  with
multiple  vitamins  and  minerals  may  reduce  esophageal/
gastric  cardia  cancer  among  persons  with  esophageal
dysplasia,  we  conducted  a  6-year  prospective  intervention
trial  in  Linxian.  Methods:  Mortality  and  cancer  incidence
were  ascertained  from  May  1985  through  May  1991  for
3318  persons  with  cytologic  evidence  of  esophageal
dysplasia  who  were  randomly  assigned 
to  receive,
throughout  that  period,  daily  supplementation  with  14
vitamins  and  12  minerals  or  placebo.  Doses  were
typically  two  to  three  times  U.S.  Recommended  Daily
Allowances.  Compliance  was  assessed  by  counting  unused
pills  monthly  for  all  trial  participants  and  by  assaying
nutrient 
from  samples  of
individuals  randomly  selected  without  replacement  every
3  months  throughout  the  trial.  Cancers  were  identified
through  routine  surveillance  and  by  special  cytology  and
endoscopy  screenings  after  2lA years  and  6 years.  Results:
A  total  of  324  deaths  occurred  during  the  6-year  inter-
vention  period;  167  occurred  in  the  control  (placebo)
group  and  157  occurred  in  the  supplement  group.  Cancer
was  the  leading  cause  of  death  (54%  of  all  deaths);  18%
were  due  to  cerebrovascular  diseases  and  29%  to  other
causes.  Cumulative  esophageal/gastric  cardia  death  rates
were  8%

receiving  supplements  rather  than  placebo,  a  nonsignifi-

total
cancer  4%  lower  (RR  =  0.96;  95%  CI  =  0.71-1.29;
P>.10),  cerebrovascular  disease  38%  lower  (RR  =  0.62;
95%  CI  =  0J7-1.06;  P  =  .08),  and  other  diseases  12%
higher  (RR  =  1.12;  95%  CI  =  0.74-1.69;  P>.10)  among
the  treated  group.  Cumulative  cancer  incidence  rates
were  nearly  the  same  in  the  two  groups.  Conclusions:  No
substantial  short-term  beneficial  effect  on  incidence  or
mortality  for  this  type  of  cancer  occurred  following  daily
supplementation  with  multiple  vitamins  and  minerals
among  adults  with  precancerous  lesions  of  the  esophagus.
Implications:  Although  no  statistically  significant  short-
term  benefits  were  observed,  longer  follow-up  should  be
more  informative  about  the  effectiveness  of  this  6-year
supplementation  on  cancer  and  other  diseases  among
individuals  with  esophageal  dysplasia.  [J  Natl  Cancer
Inst  85:1492-1498,  1993]

Rates  of  esophageal/gastric  cardia  cancer  in  Linxian,  a
rural  county  in  Henan  Province,  north-central  China,  are
among  the  highest  in  the  world  (7).  The  excess  risk  is
especially  pronounced  among  persons  with  esophageal

Haem in red meat (RM) stimulates the endogenous production of
mutagenic nitroso compounds (NOC). Processed (nitrite-preserved
red) meat additionally contains high concentrations of preformed
NOC. In two studies, of a fresh RM versus a vegetarian (VEG) diet
(six males and six females) and of a nitrite-preserved red meat (PM)
versus a VEG diet (5 males and 11 females), we investigated
whether processing of meat might increase colorectal cancer risk
by stimulating nitrosation and DNA damage. Meat diets contained
420 g (males) or 366 g (females) meat/per day. Faecal homogenates
from day 10 onwards were analysed for haem and NOC and asso-
ciated supernatants for genotoxicity. Means are adjusted for differ-
ences in male to female ratios between studies. Faecal NOC
concentrations on VEG diets were low (2.6 and 3.5 mmol/g) but
signiﬁcantly higher on meat diets (PM 175 ± 19 nmol/g versus RM
185 ± 22 nmol/g; P 5 0.75). The RM diet resulted in a larger pro-
portion of nitrosyl iron (RM 78% versus PM 54%; P < 0.0001) and
less nitrosothiols (RM 12% versus PM 19%; P < 0.01) and other
NOC (RM 10% versus PM 27%; P < 0.0001). There was no statis-
tically signiﬁcant difference in DNA breaks induced by faecal water
(FW) following PM and RM diets (P 5 0.80). However, PM re-
sulted in higher levels of oxidized pyrimidines (P < 0.05). Surpris-
ingly, VEG diets resulted in signiﬁcantly more FW-induced DNA
strand breaks than the meat diets (P < 0.05), which needs to be
clariﬁed in further studies. Meats cured with nitrite have the same
effect as fresh RM on endogenous nitrosation but show increased
FW-induced oxidative DNA damage.

Introduction

Red and processed (nitrite-preserved red) meat (PM) increase the risk
of colorectal cancer with PM showing higher risk estimates per gram
of intake than red meat (RM) (1–3). Heterocyclic amines—known
carcinogens (4)—are formed during cooking of meat at high temper-
atures, but this is not speciﬁc for red and PM (5).

RM intake shows a dose–response relation with the endogenous
formation of nitroso compounds (NOC), whereas there is no such
relation for white meat (6,7). This is probably due to the abundant
presence of haem in RM (8,9), which can readily become nitrosylated
and act as a nitrosating agent (10). Recently, we conﬁrmed that nitro-
syl iron (FeNO) is the main contributor to high RM diet-induced

endogenous formation of NOC (11).
In addition, nitrosothiols
(RSNO) are rapidly formed from nitrite and thiol groups at low pH
in the stomach and can be precursors for the endogenous formation of
nitrosyl haem and other NOC, such as N- and O-NOC, in the small
and large bowel (11,12).

Many NOC are known carcinogens and the alkylation of DNA can
induce G to A transitions in genes mutated in colorectal cancer such as
ras (13). The NOC-speciﬁc DNA adduct O6-carboxymethyl-2#-
deoxy-guanosine increases in exfoliated colonic cells from volunteers
fed a high RM diet (14). O6-carboxymethyl-2#-deoxy-guanosine is
not repaired by O6-alkylguanine transferase in in vitro assays and
may at least partly explain the link between meat consumption and
colorectal cancer.

PM is a mixed category of meats that are preserved by a variety of
mechanical, chemical or enzymatic procedures. Different preserva-
tives, such as nitrite and nitrate in ham and sulphur dioxide in saus-
ages, may be used. Minced products such as hamburgers may or may
not be classiﬁed as PM. In most populations on which existing epi-
demiological ﬁndings are based, PM mainly consists of processed
RMs such as beef and pork (3,15).

Supplements of nitrate have been shown to increase faecal NOC
levels (16), but it is not clear whether preservation by this method
would result in an increased endogenous NOC production, and hence
explain some of the higher colorectal cancer risk with processed as
compared with RM. In two studies, of a fresh RM (beef and pork)
versus a vegetarian (VEG) diet—referred to as the RM study—and of
a nitrite-preserved red meat (bacon, ham, luncheon meat and corned
beef) versus a VEG diet—referred to as the PM study—we investi-
gated whether this form of processing might increase colorectal
cancer risk by stimulating nitrosation and DNA damage.

Methods

Subjects
Healthy males and females from Cambridgeshire were recruited through local
advertisements. Participants had to be between 20 and 85 years of age, non-
smokers, free from diabetes and bowel disease, not taking medication affecting
the gut for at least 3 months prior to the study, not pregnant and not partici-
pating in another biochemical intervention study at the same time. Prior to the
study, subjects were examined by a medical practitioner.

All subjects received verbal and written information and signed a written
consent form. The studies were approved by the Cambridge Local Research
Ethics Committee.

Sixteen volunteers were included in the PM study (5 males and 11 females);
12 volunteers participated in the RM study (six males and six females), which
has been described previously (14).

Study design
The studies had a randomized crossover design of a high meat versus a VEG
period: PM versus VEG in the PM study and RM versus VEG in the RM
study. Each dietary period lasted at least 14 days. Subjects lived in the
volunteer suite of the MRC Dunn Human Nutrition Unit, where all food
was provided and carefully controlled and all specimens could be collected
and processed immediately. Subjects followed their normal routine but were
only allowed to consume foods and drinks prepared by the diet techni-
cians. Body weights were monitored to ensure a constant weight through-
out. Faecal samples were collected and weighed daily and radio opaque
marker capsules were taken throughout to check compliance and for the
measurement of transit time (17). After subjects had consumed each diet
for 10 days, stools were collected on dry ice for analysis of NOC, haem
and genotoxicity.

Study diets
All diets were provided as similar menus on a 3 day rotating schedule. Male
PM diets contained 420 g PM per day [given as 100 g bacon (days 1 and 2) or
pork luncheon meat (day 3) at lunch and 320 g corned beef (days 1 and 2) or
gammon (day 3) at dinner] and female PM diets contained 366 g PM per day
(given as 60 g bacon or pork luncheon meat at lunch and 306 g corned beef or
gammon at dinner). RM diets contained the same amount of meat, but lunch
was roast beef (days 1, 2 and 3) and dinner beef mince (days 1 and 3) or pork
(day 2). Over the course of the study, each volunteer consumed the same
amount of each type of meat.

Energy and macronutrient composition of the diets (Appendix) were
calculated using Data Into Nutrients for Epidemiological Research (DINER)
(18). Fat content of the diets was kept constant by exchanging protein for
carbohydrates. Energy requirements were estimated from body weight and
physical activity using standard equations for basal metabolic rate and esti-
mates of physical activity level (19). The energy intake of each participant was
matched to estimated energy requirement with 1 MJ standardized increments
(chocolate bar, shortbread or a combination of white bread, butter and mar-
malade) added to 8 MJ/day (female) or 10 MJ/day (males) basal diets.

Meat was not overcooked to minimize the formation of heterocyclic amines.
Puriﬁed water was given throughout for drinking and used for cooking and
low-nitrate vegetables were used to keep nitrate intake at constant low levels.
Tea, coffee and an aspartame-based sweetener were provided in the suite and
consumed freely, but subjects were asked to keep their intake constant during
the study.

Dietary and faecal NOC and haem
Duplicates for each daily diet were prepared. All foods consumed on 1 day
were prepared as normal, added together and diluted 1:2 in ultrapure water. The
mixture was homogenized with a food processor, snap frozen on dry ice and
stored at  20°C until analysis. Results are presented per gram of diet after
correction for dilution. For analysis of the separate nitrite-preserved red meats
consumed in the PM study, meats were cooked as normal and homogenized
and frozen separately as described above. Results are presented per gram of
cooked weight after correction for dilution.
For stool analysis, 40 g of frozen stool was thawed, diluted 1:5 in ultrapure
water and homogenized for 20 min in a stomacher (Colworth 3500, Seward
Medical, London, UK). The faecal homogenates were snap frozen on dry ice
and stored at  20°C until analysis. Results are presented per gram of faeces
after correction for dilution.

NOC were analysed using a modiﬁcation of the method previously used
(11), using an Ecomedics CLD 88 Exhalyzer (Ecomedics, Duernten, Switzer-
land). Approximately 100 ll of faecal homogenates or 500 ll of homogenized
diet or meat were weighed and incubated brieﬂy with 100 ll of an aqueous
solution of N-ethylmaleimide (50 mM) and diethylene triamine pentaacetic
acid (100 lM) to protect RSNO. Thereafter, 500 ll of a 5% (wt/vol) sulfamic
acid solution was added to remove nitrite and samples were injected into
a purge vessel kept at 60°C and ﬁlled with a standard tri-iodide reagent (20)
(38 mg I2 was added to a solution of 108 mg KI in 1 ml water; to this mixture,
13.5 ml glacial acetic acid was added) to determine total NOC. To determine
mercury(II) stable compounds, 100 ll 10 mM aqueous HgCl2 was added prior
to analysis; to determine mercury(II) and ferricyanide stable compounds, 100
ll each of 10 mM aqueous HgCl2 and 10 mM aqueous K3Fe(CN)6 solution
were added prior to analysis. RSNO were determined as the difference between
total NOC and mercury(II) stable NOC; FeNO was determined as difference
between mercury(II) stable NOC and mercury(II) and K3Fe(CN)6 stable com-
pounds. Other NOC were determined as mercury(II) and K3Fe(CN)6 stable
compounds.

Haem was analysed using the HemoQuant assay (8) as described previously
(11). Brieﬂy, 400 ll hot oxalic acid reagent (3 M oxalic acid, 0.1 M FeSO4, 60
mM uric acid and 60 mM mannitol) was added to 500 mg dietary or faecal
homogenate, mixed and incubated for 30 min at 100°C. After cooling, 1 ml 3
M KAc and 3 ml acetate/acetic acid (10/1 vol/vol) were added. To 2 ml of the
organic phase, 0.8 ml n-butanol and 6 ml 3 M KAc in 1 M KOH was added,
mixed and 1 ml of the organic phase subsequently extracted with 4 ml phos-
phoric acid/acetic acid (2 M phosphoric acid:glacial acetic acid, 9:1 vol/vol).
Fluorescence (excitation, 402 nm; ﬂuorescence, 600 nm) of the aqueous phase
was determined using a Spectramax Gemini XS ﬂuorimeter (Molecular Devi-
ces, Sunnyvale, CA). To quantify samples, dietary and faecal homogenates
were spiked with haemoglobin to obtain a calibration curve. Results are ex-
pressed as mmol/d for diets or nmol/g for faeces.

Faecal water genotoxicity with the comet assay
Faecal water (FW) was prepared by centrifuging 25 g of thawed faecal
homogenate at 50 000g for 2 h at 4°C. The clear supernatant was aliquoted,
snap frozen on dry ice and stored at  80°C until analysis.

Effect of processed and RM on endogenous nitrosation and DNA damage

Caco2 cells (European Collection of Cell Cultures, Salisbury, UK) were
cultured as monolayers in Eagle’s Minimum Essential Medium containing
10% foetal bovine serum, 2 mM L-glutamine, 1% non-essential amino acids
and 100 U/l penicillin–streptomycin (all Sigma–Aldrich, Gillingham, UK).
Cells were harvested after a 3 min incubation at 37°C with 0.25% trypsin–
ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) (Sigma–Aldrich) and resuspended in
non-supplemented Eagle’s Minimum Essential Medium. Three hundred micro-
litres of cell suspension (12  104 cells) was incubated with 300 ll FW
(50%) for 30 min at 37°C. A quality control was included in each experiment.
Samples were measured in duplicate in separate experiments.

Cells were centrifuged at 200g for 3 min at 4°C, the supernatant was dis-
carded and cells were resuspended in 420 ll 1% low melting point agarose
made in phosphate-buffered saline. Cells from one treatment were divided as
roughly equal drops of 70 ll over three microscope slides (two gels per
slide), a 22  22 mm coverslip was applied and gels were allowed to set at
4°C. Coverslips were removed and cells were lysed in 2.5 M NaCl; 0.1 M
Na2EDTA; 10 mM Tris–HCl, pH 10 and 1% Triton X-100 for 1 h at 4°C.
Microscope slides had been precoated with 1% normal melting point agarose
and left to dry before use.

Slides were rinsed in enzyme buffer (40 mM N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-
N#-2-ethanesulfonic acid, 0.1 M KCl, 0.5 mM EDTA and 0.2 mg/ml bovine
serum albumin, pH 8) three times for 5 min each at 4°C. Per treatment, one
slide was then incubated with enzyme buffer alone, one with endonuclease III
(EndoIII) in buffer and one with formamidopyrimidine (FPG) in buffer for 30
min at 37°C. EndoIII recognizes oxidized pyrimidines and FPG recognizes
altered purines, creating additional DNA strand breaks at these sites.

Subsequently, the DNA was allowed to unwind in electrophoresis solution
(0.3 M NaOH and 1 mM Na2EDTA, pH 13) for 40 min at 4°C before electro-
phoresis at 0.9 V/cm, 300 mA for 30 min at 4°C. Slides were neutralized in
phosphate-buffered saline and rinsed in ultrapure water for 10 min each at 4°C
and left to dry overnight at room temperature.

Gels were stained with 4#,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole and viewed by ﬂuo-
rescence microscopy. Comets were classiﬁed with visual scoring (21); 100
randomly selected comets were classiﬁed into ﬁve classes (0–4) according to
the extent of tail DNA to give an overall score of between 0 and 400 arbitrary
units per treatment.

Statistical analysis
Faecal nitrite values and transit times were 10log transformed to normalize the
distribution and are presented as geometric means and antilogged 95% conﬁ-
dence intervals (CIs). Other results are presented as mean ± SE. Meat versus
VEG results were compared within each study using a paired Student’s t-test
(two tailed). Statistical differences between PM and RM diets (between stud-
ies) were analysed by analysis of covariance with type of meat (PM or RM) as
independent variable and gender as dichotomous covariate to adjust for differ-
ences in male to female ratios between the two studies. Where PM and RM
results are compared (between studies), results are presented as adjusted mean
± SE. Where meat and VEG results are compared (within studies), results are
presented as unadjusted means.

Associations between continuous variables were tested using Pearson’s cor-
relation coefﬁcient (r). P ,0.05 was considered statistically signiﬁcant. SPSS
16 for Macintosh (SPSS, Chicago, IL, 2008) was used for the analysis.

Results

Dietary NOC and haem
Only male diets were analysed as they contained the largest amount of
meat. PM diets contained 58 ± 15 mmol/d total NOC, composed of 24
± 8 mmol/d RSNO, 20 ± 6 mmol/d FeNO and 14 ± 2 mmol/d other
NOC and 17 ± 10 lmol/d nitrite. The NOC composition of the pro-
cessed meats, i.e. bacon, corned beef, gammon and pork luncheon
meat, is shown in Table I. RM and VEG diets contained negligible
amounts of NOC and nitrite.

PM diets contained similar amounts of haem (86 mmol/d) to RM diets

(110 mmol/d). The haem content of the VEG diets was negligible.

Faecal NOC and haem
Faecal levels of NOC on VEG diets were very low but increased
signiﬁcantly on both PM and RM diets (Table II). There was no
statistically signiﬁcant difference in total NOC concentrations on
the PM and RM diets (adjusted means PM 175 ± 19 nmol/g versus
RM 185 ± 22 nmol/g; P 5 0.75). FeNO was the main contributor to
total NOC on both meat diets although the RM diet resulted in a larger
proportion of FeNO (adjusted means RM 78% versus PM 54%;
P , 0.0001) and less RSNO (adjusted means RM 12% versus PM
19%; P , 0.01) and other NOC (adjusted means RM 10% versus PM
27%; P , 0.0001) compared with PM. Similar results were obtained
when absolute concentrations were used.
NOC concentrations in FW used in the comet assay were 1.7% of
the concentration in homogenates before correction for dilution (PM
0.65 nmol/g and RM 0.41 nmol/g).

There was no statistically signiﬁcant difference between adjusted
mean faecal nitrite concentrations on the PM diet (19 nmol/g, 95% CI
11–35) and those on the RM diet (28 nmol/g, 95% CI 14–56,
P 5 0.41). Concentrations on both meat diets were signiﬁcantly high-
er than after VEG diets (3 nmol/g, 95% CI 2–6, P , 0.0001). There
was no statistically signiﬁcant correlation between concentrations of
faecal nitrite and total NOC.

Faecal haem was signiﬁcantly higher when the meat diets were con-
sumed as compared with the VEG diets (P , 0.0001, Table II) although
to a lesser extent on the PM diet compared with the RM diet (adjusted
means PM 326 ± 69 nmol/g versus RM 1033 ± 84 nmol/g, n 5 11;
P , 0.0001). Haem concentrations were positively related with FeNO
concentrations on the RM diet (r 5 0.63, P , 0.05; n 5 11) and mar-
ginally on the PM diet (r 5 0.45, P 5 0.08). Haem concentrations
were positively related to RSNO on the RM diet (r 5 0.64, P , 0.05;
n 5 11) but not on the PM diet (r 5 0.15, P 5 0.58).

FW genotoxicity with the comet assay
There was no statistically signiﬁcant difference in DNA breaks induced
in Caco2 cells by FW from both PM and RM diets (adjusted means PM
167 ± 12 versus RM 163 ± 13; P 5 0.80). However, PM resulted in
higher levels of EndoIII-sensitive sites (adjusted means PM 24 ± 5
versus RM 9 ± 5; P , 0.05) and a larger variation in FPG-sensitive
sites compared with RM (Figure 1A). Surprisingly, FW from both di-
etary studies induced signiﬁcantly more DNA strand breaks on the
VEG diets compared with the meat diets (P , 0.05; Table III).

In the comet assay, FPG detects oxidatively damaged purines but
also seems to have a high sensitivity towards N-7 alkylation of
guanine (ring opened) (22). There was no statistically signiﬁcant
correlation between FPG-sensitive sites and NOC concentrations
in faecal homogenates on both meat diets, but NOC concentrations
in FW—despite being relatively low—trended towards a positive
association with FPG-sensitive sites on the PM (r 5 0.55, P 5 0.06;
n 5 12, three samples not analysed, one sample with no peak in
assay) but not on the RM diet (r 5 0.25, P 5 0.49; n 5 10, two
samples no peak in assay) (Figure 1A). There were no signiﬁcant
associations with DNA strand breaks and EndoIII-sensitive sites
(Figure 1B). No NOC could be detected in FW on the VEG diets.
Nitrite concentrations in FW were 18% of those in faecal homo-
genates (PM study only, RM not analysed); there were no statisti-
cally signiﬁcant associations with DNA strand breaks or enzyme-
sensitive sites.

Mean transit time
Mean transit time (MTT) on the PM diet (adjusted geometric mean 44
h, 95% CI 35–55; n 5 15) was signiﬁcantly lower than on the RM diet
(adjusted geometric mean 70 h, 95% CI 55–90; P , 0.01). MTT
during both VEG periods were similar (VEG in PM study 44 h,
95% CI 35–55; n 5 15 versus VEG in RM study 55 h, 95% CI
43–70; P 5 0.18) and not signiﬁcantly different from their respective
meat periods (PM study P 5 0.80 and RM study P 5 0.07).

MTT was positively related with total NOC concentrations (r 5
0.63, P 5 0.01; n 5 15), FeNO (r 5 0.60, P 5 0.02; n 5 15) and
other NOC (r 5 0.74, P , 0.01; n 5 15) but not with RSNO
(r 5 0.13, P 5 0.64; n 5 15) on the PM diet. In contrast, there were
no statistically signiﬁcant correlations between MTT and NOC con-
centrations on the RM diet (P . 0.25).

Daily faecal weight, calculated as the mean faecal weight over
the last 4 days of the diet, was signiﬁcantly higher on the VEG
diet compared with the meat diet in both studies (PM 167.5 ± 11.9
g/d versus VEG 223.8 ± 24.1 g/d; P , 0.05 and RM 148.1 ± 19.5
g/d versus VEG 308.3 ± 41.4 g/d; P , 0.0001). There were no sta-
tistically signiﬁcant differences between studies (P . 0.12). Daily
faecal weight was not statistically signiﬁcantly associated with
MTT on any of the diets or for both studies in total (P . 0.09).

Discussion

Recently, we implicated haem as a facilitator of the endogenous for-
mation of NOC from dietary nitrite or nitrate and nitrite from

Effect of processed and RM on endogenous nitrosation and DNA damage

faeces by Mirvish et al. (24), which were deﬁned as NOC that were
formed after in vitro nitrosation of faecal supernatant.

The endogenous formation of NOC is likely to begin with the
formation of RSNO in the stomach, as acidic conditions facilitate
the formation of these compounds (11). These compounds can then
promote the formation of other NOC, in particular nitrosyl haem, in
the anaerobic and reducing environment of the gastrointestinal tract.
Considering the importance of NOC production along the gastroin-
testinal tract, the association between MTT and faecal NOC concen-
trations was investigated in the meat diets. The statistically signiﬁcant
association between MTT and faecal NOC concentrations on the PM
diet—in particular for FeNO compounds–supports the hypothesis that
these compounds are formed in the anaerobic conditions of the small
and large intestines. However, the lack of association following the
RM diet with a signiﬁcantly longer transit times suggests a threshold
effect.

The alkaline comet assay detects DNA strand breaks and alkali-
labile sites, i.e. apurinic or apyrimidinic sites or baseless sugars.
These can result from a variety of damage and might also represent
intermediates in the repair process. Including DNA glycosylase en-
zymes results in excision of oxidatively damaged nucleobases from
the DNA strand, which leaves additional strand breaks (21). Despite
the different composition of faecal NOC on PM and RM diets, there
was no clear effect on FW-induced DNA strand breaks, but
PM resulted in signiﬁcantly more FW-induced EndoIII-sensitive
sites. However, due to the very low concentrations of total NOC in
the FW, we were not able to analyse NOC composition and hence
cannot relate NOC composition of the FW and the faecal homoge-
nates. We have currently no explanation for the unexpected higher
level of DNA strand breaks on the VEG diets as compared with the
high meat diets, which is intriguing given a recent study showing
a higher colorectal cancer incidence in vegetarians than in meat
eaters (25). Nevertheless, further studies are underway exchanging
red or PM with white meat or ﬁsh to eliminate possible interfering
plant constituents, e.g. polyphenols. Dietary analysis of total phe-
nols using the Folin–Ciolcalteu method showed similar levels of
phenols in our meat and VEG study diets (data not shown), but this
test does not distinguish between different kinds of polyphenolic
compounds. However, we have not been able as yet to obtain reliable
estimates for FW levels with this method.

The aqueous fraction of faeces, prepared by either direct ultracen-
trifugation, dilution in phosphate-buffered saline or ultrapure water or
reconstitution of freeze-dried faeces, has been shown to be genotoxic
in several colonic cell lines (26–30). Previous studies, the most recent
ones using nuclear magnetic resonance proﬁling, have identiﬁed
a number of compounds in FW including short chain fatty acids,
organic acids, phenolic compounds and amino acids. Inter- and intra-
individual differences are related to variation in concentrations rather
than composition, which in turn seem to be related to diet (31,32).
However, still little is known about the nature of FW, which may
explain inconsistent results when investigating the effect of diet on
DNA damage using the comet assay (26,27,29).

Colonic cells have been shown to be susceptible to NOC-induced
damage. Potassium diazoacetate, a stable nitrosated derivative
of glycine, shows a dose–response effect on genotoxicity in
Caco2 cells, human lymphocytes and rat colonocytes (33) and N-
nitrosomorpholine causes a dose-dependent increase in DNA strand
breaks in Caco2 cells, all of which originated from alkali-labile
sites (34). No oxidative damage was observed, although pretreat-
ment with vitamins E and C reduced the formation of strand breaks
(34). Our results showed the presence of altered purines and pyr-
imidines induced by FW, with higher levels of oxidized pyrimidines
on the PM diet compared with the RM diet. Despite the NOC levels
in FW being very low compared with the faecal homogenates, they
tended to be positively related to altered purines on the PM diet
indicating that they are related to oxidative damage.

Nitrite intake from PM was 0.8 mg/d (17 lmol/d) in our study.

inducible and endogenous nitric oxide synthases (9,11,23). Similar to
our previous studies, faecal NOC levels were low (3–4 nmol/g) on
diets containing no meat and a negligible amount of haem. On nitrite-
preserved (PM) and fresh RM diets containing similar amounts of
haem (86–110 mmol/d), faecal NOC levels increase signiﬁcantly to
180 nmol/g.

Dietary NOC in the PM diet (58 mmol/d) was in the same order of
magnitude or greater as excretion, whereas NOC content of the RM
diet was negligible but resulted in similar levels of excretion in faeces
as on the PM diet (adjusted means PM 28.4 ± 2.6 mmol/d and RM
22.0 ± 3.0 mmol/d). However, on a RM diet, faecal FeNO represent
a greater proportion of total NOC compared with the PM diet and
concentrations are positively associated with haem concentrations. In
addition, on both meat diets, concentrations of FeNO were signiﬁ-
cantly higher than those of RSNO, which conﬁrms the important
contribution of haem to endogenous NOC production (9).

Mirvish et al. (24) studied mice fed hot dogs with or without
NaNO2 and concluded that faecal NOC excretion represents mainly
excretion of ingested NOC and of NOC formed by nitrosation of
precursor NOC by nitrite. In contrast, our results suggest that faecal
NOC are unlikely to be simply derived from the diet and are mainly
formed endogenously. However, the preformed NOC present in our
study diets are not to be confused with the precursor NOC analysed in

was 0.1–3.3 mg/d for women and 0.8–5.4 mg/d for men (adjusted for
energy intake, age, weekday and season), which would be somehow
lower when nitrite alone is calculated (15). The link between dietary
nitrite and cancers of the gastrointestinal
is inconclusive
(35,36), which may be because most nitrite is absorbed early
and the majority does not reach the colon (37). There was no asso-
ciation between FW nitrite and FW-induced DNA damage on our
PM diet.

tract

In conclusion, meats cured with nitrite have the same effect as
fresh RM on endogenous nitrosation but show increased FW-induced
oxidative DNA damage, which could be a result of pro-oxidative
compounds derived from both dietary factors or endogenous
immune response. The higher level of DNA strand breaks on the
VEG diets is an intriguing ﬁnding that needs to be clariﬁed in further
studies.

18, 2014)

A well known, epidemiologically reproducible risk factor for human
carcinomas is the long-term consumption of “red meat” of mamma-
lian origin. Although multiple theories have attempted to explain
this human-specific association, none have been conclusively
proven. We used an improved method to survey common foods
for free and glycosidically bound forms of the nonhuman sialic acid
N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc), showing that it is highly and
selectively enriched in red meat. The bound form of Neu5Gc is bio-
available, undergoing metabolic incorporation into human tissues,
despite being a foreign antigen. Interactions of this antigen with
circulating anti-Neu5Gc antibodies could potentially incite inflam-
mation. Indeed, when human-like Neu5Gc-deficient mice were fed
bioavailable Neu5Gc and challenged with anti-Neu5Gc antibodies,
they developed evidence of systemic inflammation. Such mice are
already prone to develop occasional tumors of the liver, an organ
that can incorporate dietary Neu5Gc. Neu5Gc-deficient mice immu-
nized against Neu5Gc and fed bioavailable Neu5Gc developed
a much higher incidence of hepatocellular carcinomas, with evi-
dence of Neu5Gc accumulation. Taken together, our data provide
an unusual mechanistic explanation for the epidemiological associ-
ation between red meat consumption and carcinoma risk. This
mechanism might also contribute to other chronic inflammatory
processes epidemiologically associated with red meat consumption.

There is a long-standing epidemiological

link between the
consumption of red meat (beef, pork, and lamb) and the
incidence of carcinomas, atherosclerosis, type 2 diabetes, and all-
cause mortality (1–4). Although such diseases have multifactorial
origins, all are aggravated by chronic inflammation (5, 6). Red
meat-rich diets also correlate with circulating markers of in-
flammation and endothelial dysfunction (7). Here, we focus on red
meat-related risk of carcinomas (further citations regarding the
association are provided in Table S1). Corroboration comes from
the low rates of carcinomas in populations that consume very low
levels or no red meat (8–10). Within the World Cancer Research
Foundation report, red meat was among the top 10 factors asso-
ciated with incidence and progression of carcinomas in all pop-
ulations (11). Enhancement of carcinoma risk appears to be highest
in tissues like colonic epithelium, in which adenomas can progress
to carcinomas, driven by molecular changes in oncogenes and tu-
mor suppressor genes (12). There are many proposed mechanisms
for the cancer-promoting effects of red meat (13), including gen-
eration of mutagens by grilling, DNA damage due to N-nitroso
compounds, or free radical generation by heme iron. However,
none of these mechanisms have been proven, and confounding facts
are apparent in some instances (e.g., grilling of poultry and fish
generates the same mutagens, yet these foods are not associated
with cancer risk) (14). Also, doses of the mutagens that induce
carcinomas in animal models are many fold higher than human

exposure (15). Overall, although more than one of these theories
may still prove to be correct, definitive proof remains lacking.

Another unexplained fact is the human specificity of this risk
(i.e., other vertebrate carnivores do not suffer a high incidence of
carcinomas). In this regard, we have suggested an unusual
human-specific mechanism, involving inflammation associated with
metabolic incorporation of a nonhuman sialic acid, N-glyco-
lylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc), and interaction with circulating
anti-Neu5Gc antibodies (16–19). Despite the fact that humans
are genetically unable to produce Neu5Gc, this molecule is de-
tectable on surfaces of human epithelia and endothelia, and in
higher amounts in malignant tissues (20). In the absence of an
alternate pathway for Neu5Gc biosynthesis (21), the only possi-
ble source for incorporation is dietary intake (22). An initial food
survey showed a prominent presence of Neu5Gc in red meat
(23). Metabolic incorporation of dietary Neu5Gc into tissues
(24) makes this glycan the first example, to our knowledge, of a
xeno-autoantigen, which can react with circulating anti-Neu5Gc
antibodies (i.e., xeno-autoantibodies) (25). The resulting anti-
gen–antibody interaction is hypothesized to generate or promote
chronic inflammation or “xenosialitis,” which could contribute
to carcinogenesis or to other diseases exacerbated by chronic
inflammation.

Significance

We present an unusual mechanism for the well-known asso-
ciation between red meat consumption and carcinoma risk in-
volving the nonhuman sialic acid N-glycolylneuraminic acid
(Neu5Gc). We first evaluate the Neu5Gc content of various
foods to show that red meats are particularly rich in orally
bioavailable Neu5Gc and then investigate human-like Neu5Gc-
deficient mice fed this form of Neu5Gc. When such mice were
challenged with anti-Neu5Gc antibodies, they developed evi-
dence of systemic inflammation. Long-term exposure to this
combination resulted in a significantly higher incidence of
carcinomas (five-fold increase) and an association with Neu5Gc
accumulation in the tumors. Similar mechanisms may contrib-
ute to the association of red meat consumption with other
diseases, such as atherosclerosis and type 2 diabetes, which are
also exacerbated by inflammation.

Although attractive in principle, this hypothesis has not been
proven in an in vivo system. Notably, Cmah−/− (CMP-Neu5Ac
hydroxylase knockout) mice with a human-like deficiency of
Neu5Gc (24) can incorporate Neu5Gc of dietary origin, but only if
provided in the bioavailable glycosidically bound form (22). How-
ever, such mice do not spontaneously generate anti-Neu5Gc
antibodies. The likely reason is that humans are spontaneously
immunized via an unusual postnatal process involving a human-
specific commensal bacterium that presents Neu5Gc from
weaning foods to the immune system (26). However, an anti-
Neu5Gc response is induced in Cmah−/− mice by active immu-
nization, and specific antisera can be generated. Using such
antisera in Cmah−/− mice bearing syngeneic Cmah+/+ tumors, we
have shown that the anti-Neu5Gc antibodies could facilitate
tumor progression by enhancing inflammation (16, 17). How-
ever, despite this suggestive evidence, we have not demonstrated
that oral feeding of Neu5Gc can induce the proposed xenosialitis
in vivo or that this process can increase rates of spontaneous
carcinomas. Also, dietary surveys on Neu5Gc in food have been
limited, the ratio of bound and free Neu5Gc has not been de-
termined, and effects of food processing have not been consid-
ered. Given our hypothesis that tissue incorporation of Neu5Gc
of dietary origin can have deleterious effects, it is important to
determine the amounts present in typical components of the
Western diet accurately. Although earlier studies attempted to
quantify Neu5Gc distribution in food (23, 27–29), a systematic
catalog of a wide variety of commonly consumed foods is lacking.
Furthermore, based on recent studies (22), it appears that gly-
cosidically bound Neu5Gc is the dietary source that is bioavail-
able for tissue incorporation, and not the free monosaccharide.
However, available data neither differentiated between bound
and free Neu5Gc nor addressed the effects of food processing.
Here, we address all these issues by first developing an assay to
determine amounts of free and bound Neu5Gc accurately in a wide
variety of foods. We then evaluate the impact of short-term and
long-term feeding of Neu5Gc in Cmah−/− mice combined with
passive or active immunization against Neu5Gc. Although the as-
sociation between red meat consumption and colon cancer is most
prominent in humans, we focus here on hepatocellular cancer in
male C57BL/6 mice as proof of principle, because these animals
have a low rate of spontaneously occurring hepatic tumors (30).

Results
Distribution of Free and Bound Neu5Gc and N-Acetylneuraminic Acid
in Foods. Acid hydrolysis and derivatization by 1,2-diamino-4,5-
methylenedioxybenzene dihydrochloride (DMB) followed by
RP-HPLC with fluorescent detection (DMB-HPLC) has been
the method of choice for the detection and quantification of
sialic acids (31). Nevertheless, this method cannot accurately
differentiate between bound and free sialic acids, because the
conditions of the derivatization reaction (1.5 M acetic acid,
50 °C, 2.5 h) result in some concurrent release of bound sialic
acid (this false-positive signal varies with the sample; 8.6% for
a model substrate, such as fetuin; Table S2). For the current
study, we therefore modified conventional protocols by adapting
temperature derivatization conditions (4 °C for 48 h) originally
introduced for preserving acid-labile polysialic acid (32). These
conditions efficiently tag free sialic acids, without any significant
release of bound sialic acids (Table S2). By studying a parallel
aliquot with the conventional method, we could accurately
quantitate free and bound Neu5Gc. Initial base treatment of
samples to eliminate O-acetyl esters also ensured a simplified
profile for quantitation.

Using this improved method, we could accurately quantitate
bound and free Neu5Gc and N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac)
in foods (examples of HPLC profiles are provided in Fig. 1). As
summarized in Table 1 and detailed in Table S3, foods from
mammals (cow, goat, sheep, pig, and bison) contain moderate to

high amounts of Neu5Gc. Three methods of cooking signifi-
cantly altered neither Neu5Gc content nor the ratio of bound
and free forms. As predicted from prior work (33), poultry and
eggs do not contain Neu5Gc and fruits and vegetables do not
contain any sialic acids. Although the CMAH gene is present in
fish, none of the seafood sampled contains significant amounts of
Neu5Gc (with the exception of caviar). As shown in Table S3,
a great majority of the sialic acids in all samples are glycosidically
bound and not free, even after cooking. Overall, the highest levels

of Neu5Gc among the red meats are in beef, which contains up to
231 μg of Neu5Gc per gram of meat, and the lowest amounts were
seen in milk and milk products, with Neu5Gc levels ranging from 2
to 40 μg/g. Beef also contains the highest percent Neu5Gc of total
sialic acid, and this Neu5Ac/Neu5Gc ratio may be relevant because
of likely competition of Neu5Ac with Neu5Gc for incorporation
into cells (34).
Systemic Inflammation Induced in Cmah−/− Mice by Dietary Neu5Gc
and Circulating Anti-Neu5Gc Antibodies. We have previously shown
that anti-Neu5Gc antibodies can influence the growth of trans-
planted Neu5Gc-positive syngeneic tumors in Cmah−/− mice by
enhancing chronic inflammation (16, 17). We now asked if oral
feeding of Neu5Gc could induce chronic inflammation in vivo,
and in a manner dependent on circulating anti-Neu5Gc anti-
bodies. Cmah−/− mice were fed a Neu5Gc-free diet or with the
same diet supplemented with Neu5Gc-rich porcine submaxillary
mucin (PSM), which contains 7–9% (wt/wt) of bioavailable gly-
cosidically bound Neu5Gc, adds only a minimal amount of
neutral sugars and amino acids to the diet, and can cause mouse
tissue incorporation of Neu5Gc over a period of weeks at levels
histologically similar to the levels seen in adult humans who have
eaten red meat for many years (22). The question to be ad-
dressed is whether the addition of anti-Neu5Gc antibodies to
such animals would generate systemic inflammation. Such an
anti-Neu5Gc antibody response can be induced by active im-
munization (26). However, we found that this response is highly
variable and difficult to control or manipulate. We therefore
challenged Neu5Gc-fed or -nonfed mice by injection of anti-
Neu5Gc–rich polyclonal serum, or with a highly specific control
serum, prepared as previously described (16, 18).
Cmah−/− mice were fed Neu5Gc-rich or control diets for 12 wk
and then injected with varying amounts of control or immune
sera calculated to achieve levels of anti-Neu5Gc antibodies in
the range found in humans (34). As shown in Fig. 2A, evidence of
systemic inflammation (elevated levels of peritoneal fluid IL-6
and serum acute-phase proteins, serum amyloid A protein, and
haptoglobin) was seen only with the combination of dietary
Neu5Gc plus infusion of anti-Neu5Gc antisera, and not with
control combinations. Furthermore, the levels of inflammatory

markers showed a dose dependency with the amount of antibody
injected (Fig. 2B). Similar studies were not done in Cmah+/+
mice, because high levels of endogenous Neu5Gc would neu-
tralize any transferred antibodies (24).

Neu5Gc-Rich Diet Promotes Hepatocellular Cancer
Incidence in
Cmah−/− Mice Only in the Presence of Anti-Neu5Gc Antibodies. To
test our hypothesis that oral feeding of Neu5Gc can result in
metabolic incorporation and interact with circulating anti-
Neu5Gc antibodies, we used the human-like, Neu5Gc-deficient
Cmah−/− mice bred into a C57BL/6 background, in which oc-
casional male mice develop liver tumors (30). Two groups of
such mice were immunized with a Neu5Gc-containing immu-
nogen (porcine RBC ghosts) and fed either a Neu5Gc-rich diet
(PSM, containing 0.25 mg of Neu5Gc per gram of chow) or
a Neu5Ac-rich diet containing edible bird’s nest (EBN; con-
taining 0.25 mg of Neu5Ac per gram of chow). Sera from the two
groups showed comparable levels of anti-Neu5Gc antibodies
(Fig. 3A), and there were no significant abnormalities in hema-
tology or blood chemistry values. Although immunohistological
examination of such mice showed Neu5Gc incorporation at
levels similar to those levels seen in tissues from red meat-eating
humans (22), precise chemical methods for comparing in-
corporation are not yet available. We therefore monitored serum
levels of the inflammatory cytokine IL-6, which is frequently
elevated in chronic liver disease and malignancy (35, 36). Sig-
nificantly higher levels were seen in the Cmah−/− mice fed PSM
for up to ∼30 wk (Fig. 3B). We also monitored the mice with
periodic MRI scans. Based on the first appearance of a visible
liver lesion by MRI at ∼40 wk (Fig. 3C), we chose to necropsy all
mice at ∼55 wk. Two of seven Cmah−/− mice fed PSM had early
hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) (Fig. 3D), supporting our
hypothesis that interaction between anti-Neu5Gc antibodies and
Neu5Gc of dietary origin facilitates carcinoma progression.
To confirm and extend the findings, we set up a comparison of
Cmah−/− and WT mice fed Neu5Gc-rich PSM, and also included
control immunizations. We chose human and chimpanzee RBC
ghosts as immunogens for this set of experiments because these
cell types are very similar, except for Neu5Gc in the chimpanzee.
This experimental condition also mimics human populations (25)

in that the antibody response is polyclonal and variable. We also
extended the duration of follow-up to >80 wk, during which
variable numbers of mice in each group either died spontane-
ously or had to be euthanized for severe dermatitis or other
moribund states. There was no specific pattern to these losses,
and necropsies showed no liver tumors. All surviving mice were
finally killed at ∼85 wk. As expected, occasional mice in some
groups had hepatic adenomas or HCCs at this late time point
(incidence ranging from 0–9%). However, only those Cmah−/−
mice that were fed PSM and immunized with Neu5Gc-rich RBC
ghosts developed HCCs at a substantially higher rate (47%; i.e.,
the mice expected to have xenosialitis). This experiment was
repeated in a second cohort, with even clearer results (i.e., car-
cinomas occurred only in the Cmah−/− mice fed PSM and im-
munized with Neu5Gc). The raw data from both experiments are
shown in Table S4, and the combined data are summarized in
Fig. 4A. Overall, in striking contrast to all of the other groups,
almost half of the Cmah−/− mice fed PSM and immunized with
chimpanzee RBC ghosts developed HCCs (histological examples
are shown in Fig. 4B, including an example of lung metastasis).
Immunohistochemistry also demonstrated incorporation of
Neu5Gc into the tumors (Fig. 4C). Taken together, our data
show that the combination of dietary Neu5Gc and circulating
anti-Neu5Gc antibodies specifically enhances carcinoma rates
only in Neu5Gc-deficient animals (P = 0.0043), in an organ that
is already prone to a baseline rate of tumorigenesis. This ob-
servation is very similar to the situation of human red meat
eaters, who show an increased incidence of carcinomas in tissues,

such as the colonic epithelium,
that are already prone to
a baseline rate of cancer incidence. To our knowledge, this
model is the first example in which incorporation of a dietary
molecule combined with antibodies against the molecule is both
necessary and sufficient to induce spontaneous carcinomas.

Discussion
We have demonstrated here that antibodies directed against the
nonhuman sialic acid Neu5Gc can interact with metabolically in-
corporated Neu5Gc derived from oral
intake and promote
inflammation in a dose-dependent manner in the human-like
Neu5Gc-deficient Cmah−/− mouse model. Furthermore, long-term
exposure to such inflammation promotes carcinoma incidence in
a target organ where Neu5Gc can accumulate; in the case of mice,
it is detected in the liver, and in humans, it is detected more
prominently in the colon, prostate, and ovary. Given that glyco-
sidically bound Neu5Gc is relevant for incorporation from dietary
sources, we have also quantified free and bound Neu5Gc content
in various food products, affirming that foods of mammalian origin
are the primary sources.

Chronic inflammation in the context of carcinogenesis and tumor
progression has been studied extensively. Although the adaptive
immune system can restrict cancer development, it can also para-
doxically assist the tumor by promoting chronic inflammation via
antibodies directed against tumor cell epitopes (37, 38). Known
mechanisms include deposition of sublytic levels of complement
with activation of the PI3K/AKT survival pathway (39) and/or
Fcγ receptor-dependent polarization of F4/80+/CD11b+ tumor-
associated macrophages into tumor-promoting M2 phenotypes,
thereby suppressing tumor infiltration by activated CD8+ lymphocytes
(40). Furthermore,
it is possible that intratumoral antibody

deposition accelerates chronic inflammation by inducing path-
ways involving COX-2 (41, 42) and NF-κB (43). Release of re-
active oxygen species by recruited phagocytic cells could also
cause DNA damage, facilitating carcinogenesis (44). On the
other hand, there are many dramatic examples of the successful
therapy of cancer with monoclonal antibodies (45). In our own
recent work, we showed that the range of antitumor antibody
levels that bridge the spectrum from tumor activation to in-
hibition can be remarkably narrow (18).

There are limitations in directly comparing this mouse study
and the human situation. Unlike the case in humans, there was
a single dietary source of Neu5Gc that was not varied in intake
and the antibody production was not sustained throughout the
lifetime of the animal. Also, the target organ for the adenoma-
to-carcinoma sequence was the liver, not the colon. The obvious
question arising from such experimental mouse studies is
whether circulating anti-Neu5Gc antibodies correlate with can-
cer risk in human population studies. We are currently exploring
this possibility, but we are also aware of the numerous compli-
cating variables in humans, such as the varying amount and un-
known bioavailability of Neu5Gc from dietary red meat, the
amount of Neu5Gc tissue loading in benign and malignant tis-
sues, the complex and variable polyclonal antibody profiles of
individual humans, the skewed distribution of antibody levels
within populations, the possibility that very high antibody levels
can inhibit tumor progression (18), and the variability of con-
current inflammatory conditions.

Further work is also necessary to determine the exact pathways
by which Neu5Gc is taken up into tissues, and potential approaches
to prevent or eliminate such incorporation are being explored. The
current findings indicate that this unique example of xenosialitis
driven by a dietary glycan is pathologically relevant and may be
involved in inflammation-driven diseases that are known to be as-
sociated with red meat consumption, including carcinomas.

Materials and Methods
Food Collection and DMB-HPLC Analysis. Sixty-two different types of food
products (raw meat and three types of cooked meats, including baked,
boiled, and fried foods, were sampled) were purchased from multiple local
supermarkets, lyophilized, and pulverized. Samples were treated with 0.1 M
NaOH at 37 °C for 30 min for the removal of O-acetyl groups and then
neutralized. Acid hydrolysis of sialic acids from the underlying glyco-
conjugate was performed with 2 M acetic acid at 80 °C for 3 h. The samples
were cooled to room temperature and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min,
and the supernatant was filtered through a Millipore Ultra Centrifugal Fil-
ter. Aliquots of nonhydrolyzed samples were adjusted to 2 M acetic acid but
not heated. The samples were then incubated with the two different deri-
vatizing conditions (below) and analyzed by HPLC as described below.

DMB Derivatization Conditions. The DMB reagent, as per the conventional
method (31, 46), was made with the following recipe and hydrolyzing con-
ditions: 14 mM DMB, 18 mM sodium hydrosulfite, 0.75 M 2-mercaptoetha-
nol, and 1.6 M acetic acid, and it was incubated at 50 °C for 2.5 h. The DMB
reagent used for the quantification of free sialic acids was prepared as fol-
lows (32): 14 mM DMB, 18 mM sodium hydrosulfite, 1 M 2-mercaptoethanol,
and 40 mM trifluoroacetic acid, and it was incubated at 4 °C for 48 h.

HPLC Analysis. The DMB-derivatized samples were analyzed on a Dionex
Ultra3000 HPLC System using a Phenomenex Gemini 5μ C18 250 × 4.6-mm
HPLC column at room temperature. The fluorescence was detected at 448
nm using excitation at 373 nm. For the separation of sialic acids that might
coelute, for example, 3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonic acid and 3-deoxy-D-
manno-octulosonic acid, an isocratic solvent composition of 88% water, 7%
methanol, and 5% acetonitrile was used. The data collection time was ex-
panded to 90 min. Standard samples were run each day to account for slight
variations in elution time.

Mice and Chow. Cmah−/− mice were bred in a congenic C57BL/6 background
and maintained in the University of California, San Diego vivarium according
to Institutional Review Board guidelines for the care and use of laboratory
animals. Cmah−/− mice were maintained on a Neu5Gc-deficient soy-based chow

(110951 for adults and 110751 for pregnancy/weaning; Dyets, Inc.), a Neu5Gc-
rich soy-based chow (custom order containing 0.25 mg of Neu5Gc per gram of
chow; Dyets, Inc.) made by adding purified PSM, or a Neu5Ac-rich soy-based
chow (custom order containing 0.25 mg of Neu5Ac per gram of chow; Dyets,
Inc.) made by adding EBN. For the preparation of PSM, cryoground porcine
submaxillary glands (Pel-Freez Biologicals) were homogenized overnight in
5 vol of water and centrifuged at 8,000 × g for 15 min, and the supernatant
was filtered through glass wool. The mucin was precipitated by gradual
acidification (to pH 3.5) at 4 °C and left to settle overnight. The supernatant
was removed by siphoning, and the precipitated mucin was centrifuged at
400 × g for 15 min, washed with water, and centrifuged again. Mucin pellets
were neutralized to pH 8.0 and dialyzed using a 10,000 molecular weight
cutoff membrane (Spectrum Labs) against 20 vol of water, with at least five
volume changes. This final preparation was lyophilized, and its Neu5Gc
content was quantified by DMB-HPLC. EBN was purchased from Golden Nest,
Inc. and lyophilized to remove excess moisture. The dry EBN was pulverized
into a fine powder, and acid hydrolysis for DMB derivatization was performed
as mentioned above. It must be noted that the addition of PSM or EBN does not
significantly increase the caloric content of the chow.

Preparation of RBC Membranes and Polyclonal Anti-Neu5Gc–Rich “Immune”
and “Control” Sera. Chimpanzee and human RBC lysis was performed using
30 vol of ice-cold lysis buffer containing 10 mM Tris·HCl and 1 mM EDTA (pH
7.4) followed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Pelleted
membranes were washed in the same buffer until colorless. Protein quan-
tification was performed, and Cmah−/− mice were immunized with 100 μL of
2 mg/mL RBC membrane ghosts (mixed with an equal volume of Freund’s
complete adjuvant) per mouse by i.p. injection. Two booster doses using
Freund’s incomplete adjuvant with the same amount of immunogen were
given 1 wk apart. Two weeks after the second booster dose, serum was
collected for ELISA analysis of anti-Neu5Gc response as described below.
Positive sera were pooled, and nonspecific anti-RBC reactivity was removed
by repeated adsorption against human RBCs. Adsorption was performed
using 100 μL of packed washed human RBCs incubated with pooled immune
or control sera at 4 °C for 2 h, and the RBCs were subsequently removed by
centrifugation. The adsorption was repeated three times. The pooled serum
from the human RBC-immunized mice was processed in exactly the same
way. The mouse anti-Neu5Gc IgG was quantitated using the ELISA method
described below. Based on the above method, these antibodies should
comprise the primary difference between the immune and control sera.

ELISAs for Detection of Anti-Neu5Gc Antibodies in Mice. Microtiter plate (Costar
9018) wells were coated with Neu5Gc-rich bovine submaxillary mucin in the
amount of 1 μg per well in 50 mM sodium carbonate-bicarbonate buffer (pH
9.5) at 4 °C overnight. After washing with PBS (pH 7.4) and blocking with PBS
containing 1% Neu5Gc-free chicken ovalbumin for 1 h at room temperature,
triplicate wells were incubated with 1:100 dilutions of mouse serum in PBS
containing 1% chicken ovalbumin at room temperature for 2 h. Wells were
washed five times with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (Fisher-Scientific) and
incubated with HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch
Laboratories), diluted in PBS at 1:7,000, at room temperature for 1 h. Anti-
Neu5Gc IgG was quantified using a standard curve of normal mouse IgG coated
to the wells under the same general conditions. To confirm the specificity of
anti-Neu5Gc antibodies, mild periodate treatment was used selectively to cleave
the Sia side-chain and eliminate specific reactivity, as described previously (47).

Measurement of Peritoneal Lavage Fluid IL-6, Serum Amyloid A Protein, and
Haptoglobin. Commercially available kits were used for the measurement of
inflammatory markers, peritoneal lavage fluid IL-6 (no. DY406, Mouse Il-6
DuoSet; R&D Systems), serum haptoglobin (no. 2410-1; Life Diagnostics, Inc.),
and serum amyloid protein A (no. TP 802M; Tridelta) according to the
manufacturers’ instructions.

Neu5Gc Detection by Immunohistochemistry. Tissues from Cmah−/− mice fed or
not fed PSM were flash-frozen in optimum cutting temperature compound
(Sakura), and frozen sections were air-dried overnight at room temperature and
then immersed in PBS containing 0.1% Tween (PBST) wash buffer. The sections on
the slides were treated to eliminate endogenous biotin and endogenous
peroxidase, and postfixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin (Fisher), washing
between each step. Positive controls on separate slides included sections from
WT mouse liver, and negative controls included sections from Cmah−/− mouse
livers. The negative controls used competitive inhibition of anti-Neu5Gc

 Background  

 Methods  

 Results  

 The  General  Population  Nutrition  Intervention  Trial  was  a  randomized  primary  esophageal  and  gastric 
cancer prevention trial conducted from 1985 to 1991, in which 29 584 adult participants in Linxian, China, 
were  given  daily  vitamin  and  mineral  supplements.  Treatment  with  “factor  D,”  a  combination  of 
50   µ g  selenium,  30  mg  vitamin  E,  and  15  mg  beta-carotene,  led  to  decreased  mortality  from  all  causes, 
cancer overall   , and gastric cancer. Here, we present 10-year follow-up after the end of active intervention.  

 Participants were assessed by periodic data collection, monthly visits by village health workers, and quar-
terly review of the Linxian Cancer Registry. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the 
cumulative effects of four vitamin and mineral supplementation regimens were calculated using adjusted 
proportional hazards models.  

 Through  May  31,  2001,  276  participants  were  lost  to  follow-up;  9727  died,  including  3242  from  cancer 
(1515 from esophageal cancer and 1199 from gastric cancer). Participants who received factor D had lower 
overall mortality (HR   =   0.95, 95% CI   =   0.91 to 0.99;  P    =   .009; reduction in cumulative mortality from 33.62% 
to 32.19%) and gastric cancer mortality (HR   =   0.89, 95% CI   =   0.79 to 1.00;  P    =   .043; reduction in cumulative 
gastric cancer mortality from 4.28% to 3.84%) than subjects who did not receive factor D. Reductions were 
mostly  attributable  to  benefits  to  subjects  younger  than  55  years.  Esophageal  cancer  deaths  between 
those  who  did  and  did  not  receive  factor  D  were  not  different  overall;  however,  decreased  17%  among 
participants younger than 55  (HR   =   0.83, 95% CI   =   0.71 to 0.98;  P    =   .025) but increased 14% among those 
aged 55 years or older (HR   =   1.14, 95% CI   =   1.00 to 1.30;  P    =   .47). Vitamin A and zinc supplementation was 
associated with increased total and stroke mortality; vitamin C and molybdenum supplementation, with 
decreased stroke mortality.  

 Conclusion  

 The  beneficial  effects  of  selenium,  vitamin  E,  and  beta-carotene  on  mortality  were  still  evident  up  to 
10  years  after  the  cessation  of  supplementation  and  were  consistently  greater  in  younger  participants. 
Late effects of other supplementation regimens were also observed.

                    With incidence rates exceeding 100 per 10 000 person-years, the 
people of Linxian, China, have some of the highest rates of esopha-
geal squamous cell carcinoma and gastric cardia adenocarcinoma 
in the world ( 1 , 2 ). Several studies in the early 1980s showed that 
nutritional  deficiencies  were  common  in  this  area,  suggesting  a 
link between these deficiencies and the high cancer rates ( 3 ). The 
Linxian General Population Nutrition Intervention Trial (NIT), a 
large-scale,  randomized,  double-blind,  primary  prevention  trial, 
was designed to test the efficacy of four combinations of vitamins 
and  minerals  in  reducing  esophageal  and  gastric  cardia  cancer 
incidence and mortality in Linxian ( 4  –  6 ). The results of this trial, 
which  started  March  1,  1986,  and  concluded  May  31,  1991, 
showed that supplementation with the antioxidant combination of 
selenium,  vitamin  E,  and  beta-carotene  statistically  significantly 
reduced total mortality, total cancer mortality, and gastric cancer 
mortality ( 5 ). The identification of statistically significant effects 

raises  questions  about  the  durability  of  these  effects  and  also 
potential good or bad late effects related to supplementation.

  CONTEXT  AND  CAVEATS 

  Prior knowledge 
 The undernourished population of Linxian, China, has high rates of 
cancer  of  the  esophagus  and  gastric  cardia.  In  the  General 
Population Nutrition Intervention Trial of 1985 – 1991, 29 584 Linxian 
villagers aged 40 – 69 years were given daily supplements of one or 
more of four vitamin and mineral combinations. “Factor D,” which 
contained selenium, vitamin E, and beta-carotene, was associated 
with  reduced  mortality  overall,  from  cancer,  and  from  gastric 
cancer.  

  Study design 
 For 15-year follow-up, villagers were interviewed monthly concern-
ing their health and registered cancer deaths were reviewed to look 
for  sustained  and  delayed  effects  of  the  vitamin  supplements. 
Hazard  ratios  for  death  by  cancer,  stroke  and  other  causes  were 
calculated for the four supplement combinations.  

  Contribution 
 Ten years after the end of the trial, participants who took factor D 
still  had  a  5%  reduction  in  total  mortality  and  11%  reduction  in 
gastric cancer; these effects were concentrated among participants 
younger than 55 years. Esophageal cancer decreased 17% in par-
ticipants younger than 55 years, but increased 14% in those older 
than 55 years.  

  Implications 
 Sustained  benefits  were  associated  with  a  combination  of  sele-
nium, vitamin E, and beta-carotene supplementation. More subtle 
long-term  effects  were  also  observed 
for  other  vitamin 
supplements.  

  Limitations 
 It  is  not  known  which  items  in  the  supplement  combination  are 
responsible  for  the  combined  effect.  Because  the  study  was  pre-
formed  in  a  nutritionally  deprived  population  with  high  rates  of 
esophageal and gastric cancer, the findings might not be applica-
ble  to  other  populations.  It  is  possible  that  the  findings  could  be 
biased  by  a  general  improvement  in  nutrition  among  the  partici-
pants over the postintervention period. 

   

 From the Editors   

 Since the conclusion of active trial treatment in 1991, follow-up 
has  continued  on  all  participants  to  collect  data  on  cancer  inci-
dence and all-cause mortality. Here we report mortality results for 
the total 15.25 years of the trial and posttrial follow-up (through 
May 31, 2001) for the original a priori trial endpoints, that is, the 
effects of the intervention agents on esophageal and gastric cardia 
cancer mortality, and for all-cause mortality. 

  Subjects and Methods 
  Design of the Trial and Posttrial Follow-up 
 The design and conduct of the Linxian General Population NIT 
and its extended follow-up have been described elsewhere ( 4  –  6 ). In 
brief, participants were recruited in 1985 from four northern com-
munes  in  Linxian,  a  rural  county  in  Henan  Province.  Residents 
40 – 69 years of age with no history of cancer or debilitating disease 
were eligible for this trial and were asked to enroll. In all, 29 584 

subjects, 60% of those invited, were randomly assigned in the trial. 
These individuals were interviewed for medical history, family his-
tory of cancer, diet, and alcohol and tobacco consumption; were 
given a brief medical exam; and were asked to donate 10-mL blood 
sample. 

 The  nine  nutrients  studied  in  this  trial  and  their  daily  doses 
were retinol (5000 IU, as retinol palmitate), zinc (22.5 mg, as zinc 
oxide), riboﬂ avin (3.2 mg), niacin (40 mg), ascorbic acid (120 mg), 
molybdenum  (30   µ g,  as  molybdenum  yeast  complex),  selenium 
(50   µ g,  as  selenium  yeast),  alpha-tocopherol  (30  mg),  and  beta-
carotene  (15  mg).  Doses  ranged  from  one  to  two  times  US  Rec-
ommended Daily Allowances. An independent study of each of these 
nutrients  and  vitamins,  although  desirable,  was  not  practical. 
Therefore, these nine nutrients were combined into four regimens 
or factors: retinol and zinc (factor A); riboﬂ avin and niacin (factor B); 
vitamin C and molybdenum (factor C); and selenium, vitamin E, 
and beta-carotene (factor D). 

 The trial had a one-half 2 4  fractional factorial design, so partici-
pants  were  randomly  assigned  by  a  computer-generated  random 
numbers list to take one of eight combinations of the four factors. 
These eight intervention groups (treatment arms) were deﬁ ned by 
the following combinations of factors: ABCD, AB, AC, AD, BC, 
BD, CD, or placebo. With this design, half the subjects received 
and half did not receive each of the four factors (eg, half received 
and half did not receive factor A). 

 Supplements were distributed in coded pill bottles from March 
1, 1986, to May 1, 1991. Throughout the trial, the pill codes were 
kept in a secured ﬁ le at the study data management center in the 
United States and were available only to the study data manager. 
During the trial period, village health workers visited participants 
monthly to deliver pills, assess pill compliance, and ascertain vital 
and  disease  status.  Diagnostic  materials  (case  records,  pathology 
slides, and X-rays) for 85% of the cancer cases in the trial period 
were  available  and  were  reviewed  by  a  panel  of  American  and 
Chinese experts. In the subsequent 10 years posttrial, village health 
workers  or  study  interviewers  continued  to  contact  participants 
monthly. For new cancer diagnoses and deaths, diagnostic materi-
als were collected and cancer diagnoses were veriﬁ ed by the panel 
of American and Chinese experts (1991 to 1996) or senior Chinese 
diagnosticians from Beijing (1996 – 2001). Throughout the trial and 
the  posttrial  follow-up,  case  ascertainment  was  considered  com-
plete and loss to follow-up minimal (n   =   276, or <1%). Outcomes 
for  this  study  were  based  on  data  from  the  full  15.25  years  of 
follow-up, from March 1, 1986 (the start of intervention), through 
May  31,  2001  (10  years  after  the  intervention  ended).  Due  to 
delayed ascertainment of outcomes, the number of deaths reported 
here for the intervention period is higher than that in our original 
report. 

 Compliance,  measured  by  pill  disappearance  rates  and  bio-
chemical  measurements,  was  excellent.  The  overall  pill  disap-
pearance  rate  was  93%,  with  no  differences  by  treatment  arm 
(range    =    92% to 93%). Blood was analyzed in quarterly surveys 
of  a  sample  of  participants  for  retinol,  beta-carotene,  ascorbic 
acid, and glutathione reductase activation coefﬁ cient as a measure 
of  riboﬂ avin  status,  and  during  the  trial  period  all  values  were 
consistently  statistically  signiﬁ cantly  different  between  treated 
and untreated individuals (all  P  values < .001) ( 4 , 5 ).

 The  conduct  of  the  Linxian  General  Population  NIT  was 
approved by the institutional review boards of the Cancer Institute 
of  Chinese  Academy  of  Medical  Sciences  and  the  US  National 
Cancer Institute, and written informed consent was obtained from 
all  participants  for  participation.  The  trial  was  registered  as 
ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00342654.  

  Statistical Methods 
 The main outcomes of this study were esophageal and gastric car-
dia  cancer  mortality  and  total  mortality.  Participants  were  cen-
sored  at  their  last  known  follow-up  date,  date  of  death,  or  the 
administrative closure of follow-up for the study (May 31, 2001), 
whichever came first. The 15.25-year follow-up period was ana-
lyzed  as  a  whole  and  in  three  5-year  periods:  the  trial  period 
(March 1, 1986, to May 31, 1991) when the intervention agents 
were given and two other periods (June 1, 1991, to May 31, 1996, 
and June 1, 1996, to May 31, 2001) when active follow-up contin-
ued  but  no  additional  intervention  was  performed.  Among  the 
cancers,  both  esophageal  squamous  cell  carcinoma  and  gastric 
cardia adenocarcinoma occur at epidemic rates in this population, 
share  some  etiologic  risk  factors,  and  before  widespread  use  of 
endoscopy and biopsy, were diagnosed as a single disease referred 
to  as  “esophageal  cancer”  or  “hard  of  swallowing  disease”  ( 7 ). 
Through  2001,  esophageal  adenocarcinoma  was  nonexistent  in 
Linxian.  We  present  data  for  the  effects  of  the  supplements  on 
mortality  of  esophageal  squamous  cell  carcinoma,  gastric  cardia 
adenocarcinoma, gastric noncardia adenocarcinoma, and the com-
bination of esophageal and gastric cardia cancer (the original hard 
of swallowing disease). 

 We tabulated baseline frequencies and percentages of partici-
pants  by  demographics.  We  compared  risk  between  those  who 
received each factor and those who did not. In the analysis of facto-
rial trials, this kind of analysis is known as “at the margins analysis” 

and has the most power to examine the effect of each factor ( 8 ). 
Cox  proportional  hazards  models  were  used  to  calculate  hazard 
ratios (HRs) and 95% conﬁ dence intervals (95% CIs) for each fac-
tor, adjusting for the other three treatment factors, sex, age (con-
tinuous),  and  commune  (four  communes).  These  analyses  were 
conducted on 29 559 of 29 584 initial study participants; 25 were 
lost  to  follow-up  before  the  intervention  began  ( Figure  1 ). 
Interactions between each of the factors and age group or sex were 
examined by including appropriate terms in the Cox models. This 
testing of interactions between each of the treatments (factors) and 
age and sex was planned a priori ( 9 , 10 ) The 55-year age cut point 
was  chosen  because  it  is  the  midpoint  in  the  40-  to  69-year  age 
distribution  of  the  trial  population.  Kaplan – Meier  estimates  of 
cumulative event rates were plotted to compare time to death for 
each factor, for all subjects, and by sex and age group ( 11 ). In addi-
tion  to  “pure”  risks  determined  from  Cox  models  and  Kaplan –
 Meier estimates, we also estimated selected “crude” risks without 
adjustment for covariates (ie, cumulative incidence), analogous to 
the  approach  of  Fine  and  Gray  ( 12 ).  The  pure  cumulative  risks 
slightly exceeded the crude cumulative risks, as expected (data not 
shown). Indeed, the estimated pure risks exceeded the crude risk 
by no more than 0.01 for total mortality, total cancer mortality, 
gastric cancer mortality, and esophageal cancer mortality. To esti-
mate  the  calendar  time – speciﬁ c  hazard  ratios  for  the  ﬁ gures,  we 
calculated smoothed (moving) hazard ratio estimates using a gen-
eralized  additive  model  with  a  local  regression  (loess)  smoother 
with span 0.4 and a test-based conﬁ dence band.     

 The assumption of a constant treatment hazard ratio across the 
three study periods was veriﬁ ed for each of the analyses by examin-
ing  treatment  by  time  period  interactions.  All   P   values  are  two-
sided  and   P   values  less  than  .05  were  considered  statistically 
signiﬁ cant. Analyses were conducted using SAS version 9.1.3 ser-
vice pack 4 (SAS Institute, Inc, Cary, NC); ﬁ gures were produced

  Results 
 Through May 31, 2001, there were 381 954 total person-years of 
follow-up over a median of 15.25 years of observation. The base-
line  demographic  characteristics,  smoking  and  alcohol  use,  and 
family history of esophageal cancer for all subjects are shown in 
 Table 1 . As expected, there were no statistically significant differ-
ences  between  any  of  these  baseline  characteristics  by  treatment 
group assignments. Smoking prevalence was comparable and alco-
hol  consumption  was  much  less  common  than  in  the  United 
States.  A  family  history  of  esophageal  cancer  was  substantially 
more common than in the West.     

 Total and cause-speciﬁ c numbers of deaths for the entire study 
period and for the three 5-year periods are shown in  Table 2 . A 
total  of  9727  deaths  were  reported  during  the  15.25  years  of 
follow-up. Deaths due to cancer and cerebrovascular diseases each 
accounted  for  approximately  one-third  of  the  total  deaths.  The 
most common speciﬁ c causes of death were cerebrovascular events 
(n    =    2984),  esophageal  cancer  (n    =    1515),  and  gastric  cancer 
(n   =   1199). Total numbers of deaths were 2528 in the trial period 
(follow-up  period  1),  3555  in  follow-up  period  2,  and  3644  in 
follow-up period 3.     

 Adjusted hazard ratios (95% conﬁ dence intervals) for the asso-
ciations  between  each  intervention  factor  and  total  and  cause-
speciﬁ c  deaths  for  the  entire  study  period  and  for  each  of  the 
5-year follow-up periods are also shown in  Table 2 . Subjects given 
factor A (retinol and zinc) had a marginally increased risk of total 
mortality for the total follow-up period (HR   =   1.04, 95% CI   =   1.00 
to 1.09;  P    =   .035) compared with subjects not given factor A. In the

factor  A  group,  the  hazard  ratio  point  estimate  for  total  deaths 
remained  consistently  higher  than  unity  in  all  three  follow-up 
periods,  with  period-speciﬁ c  estimates  of  1.03,  1.05,  and  1.05, 
respectively,  although  none  of  the  period-speciﬁ c  estimates  was 
statistically signiﬁ cant. This increased risk was mainly due to the 
effect of factor A on noncancer deaths: The hazard ratio for cere-
brovascular deaths was 1.08 (95% CI   =   1.00 to 1.16;  P    =   .045) and 
for other causes of death was 1.06 (95% CI   =   0.99 to 1.13;  P    =   .088). 
The  hazard  ratio  point  estimates  associated  with  these  causes  of 
death  remained  higher  than  unity  (although  not  statistically  sig-
niﬁ cant) for all three follow-up periods. Neither sex (interaction 
 P    =   .372) nor age group (interaction  P    =   .757) statistically signiﬁ -
cantly modiﬁ ed the effect of factor A on total mortality. Factor A 
was also associated with period-speciﬁ c protective effects for other 
cancer  deaths  in  period  2  (HR    =    0.76,  95%  CI    =    0.58  to  1.00;  
P     =    .050)  and  for  cardia  cancer  deaths  in  period  3  (HR    =    0.73, 
95%  CI    =    0.57  to  0.93;   P     =    .012),  although  neither  effect  was 
consistent in the other time periods. 

 Intervention  with  factor  B  (riboﬂ avin  and  niacin)  was  not 
associated  with  total  deaths  in  the  overall  (HR    =    0.98,  95% 
CI    =    0.94  to  1.02;   P     =    .318)  or  period-speciﬁ c  analyses  when 
compared with lack of factor B, and hazard ratio point estimates 
remained close to 1 in all three follow-up periods ( Table 2 ). This 
factor was not associated with cause-speciﬁ c deaths overall or in 
any follow-up period, except for a marginally statistically signiﬁ -
cant protective effect on total cancer deaths in follow-up period 
2  (HR    =    0.89,  95%  CI    =    0.80  to  1.00;   P     =    .043).  The  effect 
of  factor  B  on  total  deaths  was  not  statistically  signiﬁ cantly 
modiﬁ ed by sex (interaction  P    =   .177) or age group (interaction 
 P    =   .109). 

 Factor C (vitamin C and molybdenum) was not associated with 
total deaths in overall (HR   =   0.97, 95% CI   =   0.94 to 1.01;  P    =   .177) 
or period-speciﬁ c analyses when compared with lack of factor C 
( Table 2 ). However, this factor was inversely associated with over-
all risk of cerebrovascular deaths (HR   =   0.92, 95% CI   =   0.86 to 
0.99;  P    =   .023), an effect not seen during the trial period but which 
became  apparent  during  later  follow-up.  There  were  no  statisti-
cally  signiﬁ cant  associations  between  factor  C  and  total  cancer 
mortality, esophageal or gastric cancer mortality, or other causes 
of mortality in the overall or period-speciﬁ c analyses, although a 
marginally  statistically  insigniﬁ cant  increase  in  the  combined 
esophageal and cardia cancer mortality endpoint was noted in the 
overall analysis (HR   =   1.08, 95% CI   =   1.00 to 1.17;  P    =   .052). Sex 
did not modify the effect of factor C on total mortality (interaction 
 P    =   .290), but there was a statistically signiﬁ cant interaction with 
age (interaction  P    =   .003) such that younger (<55 years at random 
assignment)  participants  had  reduced  risk  (HR  =  0.89,  95% 
CI = 0.83 to 0.96;  P    =   .001) and older ( ≥ 55 years at random assign-
ment) participants were unaffected (HR   =   1.01, 95% CI   =   0.97 to 
1.06;  P    =   .607). Statistically signiﬁ cant age group interactions were 
also seen for factor C with total cancer mortality and esophageal 
cancer  mortality;  younger  patients  were  unaffected  but  older 
participants had elevated hazard ratios ( Table 3 ).     

 Factor D (selenium, vitamin E, and beta-carotene) reduced total 
mortality (HR   =   0.95, 95% CI   =   0.91 to 0.99;  P    =   .009; reduction in 
cumulative  mortality  from  33.62%  in  the  no – factor  D  group  to 
32.19% in the factor D group). Moving hazard ratio curves ( Figure 2 )

show the smoothed hazard ratios remained less than 1.0 for most of 
the 15.25 years of observation, indicating a protective effect during 
most  of  this  period.  The  estimated  hazard  ratios  for  the  three 
follow-up periods were 0.91 (95% CI   =   0.84 to 0.99;  P    =   .023), 0.99 
(95% CI   =   0.93 to 1.06;  P    =   .723), and 0.94 (95% CI   =   0.88 to 1.00; 
 P     =    .046),  respectively  ( Table  2 ).  The  hazard  ratios  for  the  three 
major group causes of mortality for the full 15.25 years of follow-up 

were also less than 1.0 but were not uniformly statistically signiﬁ cant: 
0.95 (95% CI   =   0.89 to 1.02;  P    =   .148) for cancer, 0.98 (95% CI   =   
0.98  to  1.05;   P     =    .613)  for  cerebrovascular  events,  and  0.92  (95% 
CI   =   0.86 to 0.98;  P    =   .013) for other causes. The majority of the 
overall effect was attributed to a reduced risk of death from gastric 
cancer  and  causes  of  death  other  than  cancer  or  cerebrovascular 
diseases.

D.  The  hazard  ratios  were  0.95  (95%  CI    =    0.91  to  0.99;

(95% CI = 0.94 to 1.03;  P    =   .367) for subjects 55 or older at study entry 
( Table 3 ). Therefore, virtually the entire effect of factor D on total 
mortality was due to effects in individuals younger than 55 years.

mortality ( Figure 4 ), and esophageal cancer mortality ( Figure 5 ) all 
show that the effects of factor D were predominantly or exclusively 
in subjects younger than 55 years. The hazard ratios for total can-
cer mortality associated with factor D were 0.95 (95% CI   =   0.89 to 
1.02;   P     =    .148)  for  all  subjects,  0.85  (95%  CI    =    0.76  to  0.95; 
 P    =   .003) for those younger than 55, and 1.02 (95% CI   =     ⫺ 0.94 to 
1.12;   P     =    .976)  for  those  55  or  older  ( Table  3 ).  Corresponding 
hazard ratios for gastric cancer mortality were 0.89 (95% CI   =   0.79 
to 1.00;  P    =   .043), 0.83 (95% CI   =   0.69 to 1.00;  P    =   .046), and 0.93 
(95% CI   =   0.80 to 1.07;  P    =   .307). Cumulative crude gastric cancer 
mortality  for  all  subjects  was  4.28%  in  the  no – factor  D  group 
compared with 3.84% in the factor D group, an overall reduction 
of 0.44%. For esophageal cancer mortality, effect modiﬁ cation by 
age was even more pronounced. There was no overall association 
between factor D and esophageal cancer mortality for all subjects 
(HR   =   1.01, 95% CI   =   .91 to 1.11;  P    =   .905); however, in subjects 
younger  than  55  years,  factor  D  esophageal  cancer  mortality 
decreased (HR   =   0.83, 95% CI   =   0.71 to 0.98;  P    =   .025), whereas 
in individuals aged 55 years or older, it increased (HR   =   1.14, 95% 
CI   =   1.00 to 1.30;  P    =   .047) ( Table 3 ).              

  Discussion 
 The initial results of the Linxian General Population NIT, pub-
lished in 1993, showed no association between factors A, B, or C 
and  overall  mortality,  total  cancer  mortality,  or  mortality  from 

esophageal  or  gastric  cancers  ( 5 ).  However,  factor  D,  which 
included selenium, vitamin E, and beta-carotene, statistically sig-
nificantly reduced total mortality, total cancer mortality, and mor-
tality  from  gastric  cancer  ( 5 ).  An  important  question  remained, 
however,  whether  the  preventive  effects  of  factor  D  would  last 
beyond  the  trial  period.  The  results  of  the  continued  follow-up 
show  that  hazard  ratios,  as  indicated  by  moving  hazard  ratio 
curves, remained less than 1.0 for each of these endpoints for the 
majority of the follow-up period; 10 years after completion of the 
trial, the group that received factor D still showed a 5% reduction 
in total mortality and an 11% reduction in gastric cancer mortality. 
Overall, one in 70 people who took factor D was spared death from 
all causes, and one in 227 was spared death from gastric cancer. 

 Stratiﬁ cation  of  results  by  sex  and  age  was  planned  a  priori. 
There  were  no  statistically  signiﬁ cant  interactions  with  sex. 
However, when stratiﬁ ed by age, factor D had a strong protective 
effect in individuals younger than 55 years but almost no effect on 
subjects aged 55 years or older. This pattern was seen consistently 
for total mortality, total cancer mortality, gastric cancer mortality, 
and esophageal cancer mortality. Indeed, the effect of factor D on 
esophageal cancer was reversed by age, showing a protective effect 
for younger but a harmful effect for older individuals. 

 Because  this  trial  provided  selenium,  vitamin  E,  and  beta-
carotene as one factor, it was not possible to disentangle the effects 
of  these  three  supplements.  However,  observational  case – cohort 
studies  using  subjects  in  this  cohort  and  patients  with  upper

gastrointestinal tract cancers that developed during the interven-
tion period showed inverse associations between risk of esophageal 
cancer and baseline serum levels of selenium and alpha-tocopherol, 
but  not  beta-carotene  ( 13  –  15 ).  Higher  baseline  serum  selenium 
also was associated with reduced risk of gastric cardia cancer ( 13 ). 
These results suggest that the protective effects seen in the ran-
domized trial were due to the selenium and vitamin E components. 
In a subcohort of 1103 subjects from this trial followed through 
May  31,  2001,  higher  baseline  serum  selenium  levels  also  were 
associated  with  statistically  signiﬁ cant  reductions  in  esophageal 
and  gastric  cardia  cancer  mortality  ( 16 ).  A  separate  randomized 
controlled trial in Linxian ( 17 ) gave further support for a preven-
tive  effect  of  selenium  in  subjects  with  preexisting  esophageal 
squamous dysplasia, the precursor lesion of esophageal squamous 
cell carcinoma. Compared with control subjects, those with mild 
dysplasia who received 10 months of daily supplementation with 
200  µ g of selenomethionine were more likely to have regression 
and less likely to have progression of their esophageal squamous 
dysplasia. 

 In addition to evaluating the durability of the beneﬁ cial effects 
observed  during  the  trial  period  for  factor  D,  we  also  evaluated 
other postintervention events in this trial to look for late effects, 
and  several  were  noted.  When  the  full  15.25  years  of  follow-up 
were  considered,  nutritional  supplementation  with  factor  A 
(vitamin A and zinc) was associated with increased total mortality, 
mainly due to an increase in stroke deaths among subjects given 

factor  A  compared  with  those  who  were  not  given  factor  A, 
whereas supplementation with factor C (vitamin C and molybde-
num) was associated with a decrease in stroke deaths and with a 
slight increase in esophageal/cardia cancer deaths. 

 Increased mortality among factor A recipients was not expected, 
given  the  low  retinol  levels  of  the  population  at  the  start  of  the 
trial, the modest doses of both vitamin A and zinc, and the gener-
ally null or protective results from previous observational studies 
in this cohort relating high serum retinol and tissue zinc concen-
trations  to  various  cancer  endpoints  ( 15 , 18 ).  In  fact,  a  previous 
analysis of stroke (the main contributor to the observed increase in 
total mortality) in this trial showed a protective effect for persons 
who took the combination of factor A and factor D (HR    =    0.71, 
95% CI    =    0.50 to 1.00, for group AD vs placebo) ( 19 ). 

 We were surprised that factor C, a combination of vitamin C 
and molybdenum, appeared to be associated with increased risk for 
the  combined  esophageal  and  cardia  cancer  endpoint,  given  the 
well-known  role  of  vitamin  C  as  an  antioxidant  and  inhibitor  of 
carcinogenic  N -nitroso compound production in the stomach ( 20 ). 
Furthermore,  many  epidemiological  studies  have  shown  reduced 
risk  of  these  cancers  in  persons  with  high  consumption  of  fruits 
and vegetables and rich sources of vitamin C, and the only pro-
spective  study  of  plasma  vitamin  C  and  gastric  cancer  showed  a 
protective effect for high concentrations ( 21 ). No similar prospec-
tive studies of plasma vitamin C values in esophageal cancer are 
known.

 The  decreased  risk  of  stroke  among  trial  participants  who 
received factor C was not wholly unexpected. Higher plasma vita-
min C levels have been associated with reduced risk of stroke in 
prospective epidemiological studies ( 22  –  24 ), although randomized 
trials that have included vitamin C as part of an antioxidant vitamin 
treatment  arm  have  not  shown  any  effect  ( 25 , 26 ).  There  are  no 
data on molybdenum and stroke. 

 The effects of vitamin and mineral supplements on reduction of 
total  mortality  and  cancer  mortality  have  been  heavily  debated 
over the past 25 years. The results of this study need to be inter-
preted in the context of other trials of vitamin and mineral supple-
mentation. By the 1980s, it was established that antioxidants could 
quench free oxygen radicals and potentially reduce the risk of can-
cer by preventing DNA damage by these radicals. Observational 
epidemiological studies showed inverse associations between can-
cer incidence and dietary intake of several vitamins and minerals, 
but more deﬁ nitive evidence awaited the completion of random-
ized  trials  ( 27 ).  It  was  generally  assumed  that  prescribing  pills 
would be a more convenient and acceptable way to prevent cancer 
than proscribing carcinogens. These facts and assumptions moti-
vated the design and conduct of the ﬁ rst generation of randomized 
controlled cancer prevention trials, including the Linxian General 
Population NIT, to reduce cancer risk using vitamins and miner-
als. The results of the largest and most informative of these trials 
(ie, those with more than 10 000 participants) were often contrary 
to the initial expectations. Beta-carotene supplementation increased 

total  mortality  in  both  the  Alpha-Tocopherol,  Beta-Carotene 
(ATBC) Cancer Prevention Study ( 28 ) and the beta-CArotene and 
Retinol Efﬁ cacy Trial (CARET) Study ( 29 ), whereas no mortality 
beneﬁ t  for  beta-carotene  was  seen  in  either  The  Physicians ’  
Health Study (PHS) ( 30 ) or the Women ’ s Health Study ( 31 ). The 
most likely explanation for the unexpected ﬁ ndings from these four 
large trials conducted in the West is a mismatch of the design of 
the trials with the population attributes: each of these trials tested 
pharmacological doses of micronutrients in already well-nourished 
populations ( 32 ). 

 A recent meta-analysis of randomized trials of antioxidant sup-
plements  for  prevention  of  cancer  and  other  diseases  ( 33 )  com-
bined  the  results  of  these  large-scale  studies  with  many  smaller 
studies and concluded that treatment with beta-carotene, vitamin A, 
or vitamin E likely increased total mortality, and the effect of vita-
min C or selenium on total mortality needed further study. The 
results of this study agree in part with the meta-analysis conclu-
sions. In this trial, factor A (which included vitamin A) increased 
mortality, factor C (which included vitamin C) was not associated 
with  overall  mortality,  and  factor  D  (which  included  selenium) 
decreased mortality. However, beta-carotene and vitamin E, two 
supplements that were associated with increased mortality risk in 
the  meta-analysis,  were  in  factor  D,  which  reduced  mortality  in 
this trial. Several potential explanations exist for these apparently 
discrepant results. First, the protective effect of selenium may have 
been stronger than the possible deleterious effects of beta-carotene

and  vitamin  E  in  this  trial,  so  the  overall  effect  of  factor  D  was 
beneﬁ cial.  This  hypothesis  is  supported  by  medium-sized  trials 
that have shown beneﬁ cial effects for selenium in reducing mortal-
ity and cancer risk ( 34  –  36 ). 

 A  second  possible  explanation  for  these  discrepancies  is  that 
baseline  nutritional  status  of  the  populations  studied  inﬂ uenced 
the supplementation effects. The people of Linxian are nutrition-
ally deﬁ cient ( 3 , 37 ), so vitamin and mineral supplements may be 
more beneﬁ cial to them than to other populations that have been 
studied.  The  results  of  the  Dysplasia  NIT  ( 38 ),  a  medium-sized 
randomized nutrition intervention trial that was conducted among 
subjects with cytologically diagnosed esophageal squamous dyspla-
sia in Linxian at the same time as the General Population NIT, 
showed that supplementation with 26 minerals and vitamins was 
associated with a non – statistically signiﬁ cant 7% reduction in mor-
tality risk. Results from the Nutritional Prevention of Cancer Trial 
showed  that  the  beneﬁ ts  for  selenium  supplementation  on  total 
cancer mortality ( 39 ) and the development of prostate cancer ( 36 ) 
were essentially limited to participants with lower selenium levels 
at the start of the trial. Further support for this hypothesis comes 
from the data of the meta-analysis of antioxidant supplement trials 
and total mortality itself ( 33 ). We classiﬁ ed the 68 study popula-
tions included in this analysis as Western (n    =    58), East Asian (n    =    8), 
or other (n    =    2) and found statistically signiﬁ cant heterogeneity 
between the results of the studies performed in Western and East 
Asian populations. The Western studies had a combined odds ratio 
(OR) of 1.04 (95% CI    =   1.01 to 1.06) and the East Asian studies 
had a combined OR of 0.92 (95% CI    =    0.84 to 1.02) ( ␹  2  for het-
erogeneity   P      =   .02).  Because  nearly  all  of  the  events  in  the  East 
Asian group came from Linxian, which we know has borderline or 
deﬁ cient nutrition, this difference in meta-analysis results may well 
reﬂ ect differences in the baseline nutritional status of the popula-
tions evaluated. 

 A  third  possible  explanation  for  the  heterogeneity  of  results 
observed among studies that have evaluated the association of vita-
min supplements and total mortality or gastrointestinal cancer risk 
is effect modiﬁ cation by the stage of disease at study entry. Our 
results show that only individuals younger than 55 years beneﬁ ted 
from factor D. This result may indicate greater beneﬁ t earlier in 
the course of carcinogenesis and is consistent with a “point of no 
return,” beyond which supplementation with vitamins is not useful 
and  may  be  harmful,  preferentially  beneﬁ ting  the  developing 
tumor more than the host. This hypothesis may help explain why 
observational  studies,  which  reﬂ ect  long-term  intake  of  vitamins 
and vitamin-containing fruits and vegetables, have usually shown 
beneﬁ cial  associations,  whereas  trials,  which  have  largely  been 
conducted in older patients, have sometimes shown harmful effects 
from vitamin interventions. 

 Participants in the ATBC and CARET studies, in addition to 
being older than those in the Linxian general population trial (ages 
50 – 69 years for ATBC and 45 – 74 years for CARET), were heavy 
smokers and some were exposed to asbestos, both powerful carci-
nogenic exposures that may have put them beyond the point in the 
disease process that they could beneﬁ t from supplements. Detailed 
analyses of both of these studies have shown that the increased risk 
associated with vitamin use was almost exclusively seen in current 
(as  opposed  to  former)  smokers  ( 40 )  and  in  those  who  smoked 

most ( 41 ). In contrast, the PHS study, which included fewer than 
10% smokers, showed no adverse effect of beta-carotene ( 30 ). 

 In addition to this report, three other cancer prevention nutri-
tion  intervention  trials  have  reported  results  from  continued 
follow-up after the termination of intervention. Follow-up of the 
participants of the ATBC Study for up to 8 years after the end of 
the  intervention  showed  that  both  the  harmful  effects  of  beta-
carotene (ie, increased total mortality and lung cancer incidence) 
and the beneﬁ cial effect of vitamin E (ie, decreased prostate cancer 
incidence)  disappeared,  albeit  slowly  ( 42 ).  However,  analyses  of 
cerebral infarcts (80% of all strokes) among vitamin E recipients in 
the ATBC Study showed reversed effects during the trial (relative 
risk [RR]   =   0.86, 95% CI   =   0.75 to 0.99) ( 43 ) and the 6 years post-
trial  (RR    =    1.13,  95%  CI    =    1.00  to  1.27)  ( 44 ).  After  6  years  of 
postintervention follow-up in the CARET study, the relative risk 
of total mortality remained greater than 1.0, but this elevated risk 
diminished  and  was  no  longer  statistically  signiﬁ cant  ( 45 ).  Lung 
cancer  mortality,  however,  was  still  statistically  signiﬁ cantly 
increased. The Calcium Polyp Prevention Trial reported that the 
protective  effect  of  calcium  supplementation  on  colorectal  ade-
noma recurrence found during the trial period (RR   =   0.81, 95% 
CI   =   0.74 to 0.98) ( 46 ) continued up to 5 years after supplementa-
tion  ended  and  was,  if  anything,  stronger  after  than  during  the 
intervention itself (RR   =   0.63, 95% CI   =   0.46 to 0.87) ( 47 ). 

 Durability of cancer prevention effects after cessation of inter-
vention has also been observed with nonnutritional agents. In fact, 
the most consistent example of a sustained cancer prevention effect 
reported to date from any cancer prevention agent tested in trials 
is  for  tamoxifen  in  the  primary  prevention  of  breast  cancer. 
Posttrial  follow-up  from  three  tamoxifen  trials  ( 48  –  50 )  consis-
tently found beneﬁ t after the conclusion of active treatment, and 
in one trial ( 50 ), statistically signiﬁ cant reduction in risk (among 
patients  with  estrogen  receptor-positive  tumors)  was  seen  only 
after treatment had ceased. 

 This study has several strengths. It was a randomized double-
blind design and had excellent compliance and long-term follow-up 
with  virtually  complete  ascertainment  of  cases  in  a  well-deﬁ ned 
population. 

 This study also has limitations. Interventions with factors con-
taining  multiple  agents  do  not  allow  evaluation  of  the  effects  of 
individual agents alone, nor were we able to evaluate more than 
one  dose  for  each  of  the  agents  supplemented.  The  people  of 
Linxian are deﬁ cient in many micronutrients, which may limit the 
generalizability of these results to well-nourished populations. If 
the protective effects of this study are due to replacement of essen-
tial nutrients in a nutritionally deprived population, then similar 
interventions might be useful in similarly deprived populations in 
the West, including the United States, although populations with 
low rates of esophageal and gastric cancer mortality are unlikely to 
avert  as  many  deaths  as  high-rate  populations  such  as  that  in 
Linxian.  Finally,  the  smoothed  hazard  ratios  that  we  presented 
were intended to provide an alternative visual representation of the 
effects at speciﬁ c points in time and to complement the cumulative 
view offered by the Kaplan – Meier curves. These smoothed hazard 
ratios  should  be  interpreted  with  caution,  however,  because  the 
conﬁ dence intervals around these curves nearly always include 1.0. 
Thus, such curves are affected by the play of chance and may be

biased by choice of smoothing parameters, edge effects, and other 
factors. 

 It should be noted that the follow-up period occurred during a 
time of dramatic economic progress in China as a whole. Although 
documented  improvements  in  dietary  intakes  in  Linxian  during 
follow-up  were  modest  ( 37 ),  more  substantial  undocumented 
changes  almost  certainly  occurred.  Effects  of  dietary  improve-
ments should have been evenly distributed across all participants in 
the various randomized treatment groups in the trial. Thus, if the 
effects of the supplements and the dietary micronutrient intake are 
additive, any dietary changes that might have occurred should not 
bias the treatment group effects in the postintervention period. If 
instead  the  beneﬁ t  from  supplementation  was  to  correct  a  deﬁ -
ciency state to exceed some minimum required threshold, then, if 
all  people  started  to  become  less  deﬁ cient  because  of  dietary 
improvements over time, the observed treatment effects would be 
expected to weaken. It is all the more remarkable then that beneﬁ ts 
persisted  despite  this  likely  improved  nutrition  and  its  attendant 
attenuation of treatment effects. It is also possible that improved 
diet  may  have  modiﬁ ed  effects  in  the  postintervention  period, 
including the enhanced beneﬁ t widely observed in younger partici-
pants and the emergence of late effects, most notably the beneﬁ t 
for factor C on cerebrovascular deaths. 

 In summary, 10 years of postintervention follow-up of partici-
pants in this cancer prevention trial demonstrated the durability of 
previously  observed  beneﬁ cial  effects  on  mortality  from  supple-
mentation with selenium, vitamin E, and beta-carotene. The per-
sistence of risk reduction for up to 10 years after treatment in this 
trial reinforces the validity of the original trial ﬁ ndings and is con-
sistent  with  an  emerging  new  paradigm  in  cancer  prevention, 
namely,  that  prevention  may  be  achievable  with  short-term  as 
opposed  to  life-long  treatment.  Striking  age  interactions  were 
seen,  suggesting  that  supplements  may  be  more  beneﬁ cial  in 
younger age groups. Late beneﬁ cial and harmful effects on mortal-
ity not observed during the trial period of supplementation were 
also  seen  for  other  supplementation  groups.  Durability  and  late 
effects should be examined in other prevention trials.

Background: High intakes of red or processed meat may
increase the risk of mortality. Our objective was to de-
termine the relations of red, white, and processed meat
intakes to risk for total and cause-specific mortality.

Methods: The study population included the National
Institutes of Health–AARP (formerly known as the Ameri-
can Association of Retired Persons) Diet and Health Study
cohort of half a million people aged 50 to 71 years at base-
line. Meat intake was estimated from a food frequency
questionnaire administered at baseline. Cox propor-
tional hazards regression models estimated hazard ra-
tios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) within
quintiles of meat intake. The covariates included in the
models were age, education, marital status, family his-
tory of cancer (yes/no) (cancer mortality only), race, body
mass index, 31-level smoking history, physical activity,
energy intake, alcohol intake, vitamin supplement use,
fruit consumption, vegetable consumption, and meno-
pausal hormone therapy among women. Main outcome
measures included total mortality and deaths due to can-
cer, cardiovascular disease, injuries and sudden deaths,
and all other causes.

in the highest vs lowest quintile of red (HR, 1.31 [95%
CI, 1.27-1.35], and HR, 1.36 [95% CI, 1.30-1.43], re-
spectively) and processed meat (HR, 1.16 [95% CI, 1.12-
1.20], and HR, 1.25 [95% CI, 1.20-1.31], respectively)
intakes had elevated risks for overall mortality. Regard-
ing cause-specific mortality, men and women had el-
evated risks for cancer mortality for red (HR, 1.22 [95%
CI, 1.16-1.29], and HR, 1.20 [95% CI, 1.12-1.30], re-
spectively) and processed meat (HR, 1.12 [95% CI, 1.06-
1.19], and HR, 1.11 [95% CI 1.04-1.19], respectively) in-
takes. Furthermore, cardiovascular disease risk was
elevated for men and women in the highest quintile of
red (HR, 1.27 [95% CI, 1.20-1.35], and HR, 1.50 [95%
CI, 1.37-1.65], respectively) and processed meat (HR, 1.09
[95% CI, 1.03-1.15], and HR, 1.38 [95% CI, 1.26-1.51],
respectively) intakes. When comparing the highest with
the lowest quintile of white meat intake, there was an in-
verse association for total mortality and cancer mortal-
ity, as well as all other deaths for both men and women.

Conclusion: Red and processed meat intakes were as-
sociated with modest increases in total mortality, can-
cer mortality, and cardiovascular disease mortality.

Results: There were 47 976 male deaths and 23 276 fe-
male deaths during 10 years of follow-up. Men and women

analyses of meat intake have been carried
out in Seventh-Day Adventists in the
United States1,2 and other vegetarian popu-
lations in Europe.3-6 Vegetarian diets dif-
fer from nonvegetarian diets in several re-
spects. The main sources of protein in a

vegetarian diet are legumes, grains, and
nuts. Vegetarian diets also include higher
intakes of vegetables, unsaturated fats, di-
etary fiber, and antioxidants (carot-
enoids and vitamins C and E), although
they contain lower amounts of iron, zinc,
and vitamin B12. Furthermore, other life-
style factors, such as smoking, physical ac-
tivity, and alcohol consumption among
vegetarians and members of select reli-
gious groups can differ substantially from
the general population.

We prospectively investigated red, white,
and processed meat intakes as risk factors
for total mortality, as well as cause-
specific mortality, including cancer and car-
diovascular disease (CVD) mortality in a co-
hort of approximately half a million men

(NIH)–AARP (formerly known as the American Associa-
tion of Retired Persons) Diet and Health Study.7 This large
prospective study facilitated the investigation of a wide
range of meat intakes with chronic disease mortality.

METHODS

STUDY POPULATION

Individuals aged 50 to 71 years were recruited from 6 US states
(California, Florida, Louisiana, New Jersey, North Carolina, and
Pennsylvania) and 2 metropolitan areas (Atlanta, Georgia, and
Detroit, Michigan) to form a large prospective cohort, the NIH-
AARP Diet and Health Study. Questionnaires on demographic
and lifestyle characteristics, including dietary habits, were mailed
to 3.5 million members of AARP in 1995, as described in de-
tail elsewhere.7 The NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study was ap-
proved by the Special Studies Institutional Review Board of the
US National Cancer Institute. Completion of the baseline ques-
tionnaire was considered to imply informed consent.

DIETARY ASSESSMENT

A 124-item food frequency questionnaire (http://riskfactor
.cancer.gov/DHQ/forms/files/shared/dhq1.2002.sample.pdf) was
completed at baseline. The food frequency questionnaire col-
lected information on the usual consumption of foods and drinks
and portion sizes over the last 12 months. The validity of the
food frequency questionnaire was estimated using two 24-
hour recalls,8 and the estimated energy-adjusted correlations
ranged from 0.36 to 0.76 for various nutrients and attenuation
factors ranged from 0.24 to 0.68. Red meat intake was calcu-
lated using the frequency of consumption and portion size in-
formation of all types of beef and pork and included bacon, beef,
cold cuts, ham, hamburger, hotdogs, liver, pork, sausage, steak,
and meats in foods such as pizza, chili, lasagna, and stew. White
meat included chicken, turkey, and fish and included poultry
cold cuts, chicken mixtures, canned tuna, and low-fat sau-
sages and low-fat hotdogs made from poultry. Processed meat
included bacon, red meat sausage, poultry sausage, luncheon
meats (red and white meat), cold cuts (red and white meat),
ham, regular hotdogs and low-fat hotdogs made from poultry.
The components constituting red or white and processed meats
can overlap because both can include meats such as bacon, sau-
sage, and ham, while processed meat can also included smoked
turkey and chicken. However, these meat groups are not used
in the same models; thus, they are not duplicated in any one
analysis.

To investigate whether the overall composition of meat in-
take was associated with mortality, we created 3 diet types: high-,
medium-, and low-risk meat diet. To form these diet variables,
red and white meat consumption was energy adjusted and split
into 2 groups using the median values as cut points. Individuals
with red meat consumption in the upper half and white meat con-
sumption in the lower half got a score of 1 (high-risk meat diet),
those with both red and white meat consumption in the same half
got a score of 2 (medium-risk meat diet), and those with red meat
consumption in the lower half and white meat consumption in
the upper half got a score of 3 (low-risk meat diet).

COHORT FOLLOW-UP AND CASE

ASCERTAINMENT

Cohort members were followed-up from the date the baseline
questionnaire was returned (beginning 1995) through Decem-

ber 31, 2005, by annual linkage of the cohort to the National
Change of Address database maintained by the US Postal Ser-
vice and through processing of undeliverable mail, other ad-
dress change update services, and directly from cohort mem-
bers’ notifications. For matching purposes, we have virtually
complete data on first and last name, address history, sex, and
date of birth. Follow-up for vital status is performed by annual
linkage of the cohort to the Social Security Administration Death
Master File in the US verification of vital status, and cause of
death information is provided by follow-up searches of the Na-
tional Death Index (NDI) Plus with the current follow-up for
mortality covered until 2005.

CAUSE-SPECIFIC CASE ASCERTAINMENT

Cancer (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision
[ICD-9] codes 140-239 and International Statistical Classifica-
tion of Diseases, 10th Revision [ICD-10] codes C00-C44, C45.0,
C45.1, C45.7, C45.9, C48-C97, and D12-D48) mortality in-
cluded deaths due to cancers of the oral cavity and pharynx,
digestive tract, respiratory tract, soft tissue (including heart),
skin (excluding basal and squamous cell carcinoma), female
genital system and breast, male genital system, urinary tract,
endocrine system, lymphoma, leukemia, and other miscella-
neous cancers.

Cardiovascular disease (ICD-9 codes 390-398, 401-404, 410-
438, and 440-448 and ICD-10 codes I00-I09, I10-I13, I20-I51, and
I60-I78) mortality was from a combination of diseases of the heart;
hypertension without heart disease; cerebrovascular diseases; ath-
erosclerosis; aortic aneurysm and dissection; and other diseases
of the arteries, arterioles, and capillaries.

Mortality from injuries and sudden deaths (ICD-9 codes 800-
978 and ICD-10 codes U01-U03, V01-Y09, Y35, Y85-Y86, Y87.0,
Y87.1, and Y89.0) included deaths due to unintentional in-
jury, adverse effects, suicide, self-inflicted injury, homicide, and
legal intervention.

All others deaths included mortality from tuberculosis, hu-
man immunodeficiency virus, other infectious and parasitic dis-
eases, septicemia, diabetes mellitus, Alzheimer disease, stom-
ach and duodenal ulcers, pneumonia and influenza, chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease and allied conditions, chronic
liver disease and cirrhosis, nephritis, nephrotic syndrome and
nephrosis, congenital anomalies, certain conditions originat-
ing in the perinatal period, ill-defined conditions, and un-
known causes of death.

Total mortality is a combination of all of the aforemen-

tioned causes of deaths.

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS

A total of 617 119 persons returned the baseline question-
naire; of these, we excluded individuals who moved out of the
8 study areas before returning the baseline questionnaire
(n=321), requested to be withdrawn from the study (n=829),
died before study entry (n=261), had duplicate records (n=179),
indicated that they were not the intended respondent and did
not complete the questionnaire (n=13 442), provided no in-
formation on gender (n=6), and did not answer substantial por-
tions of the questionnaire or had more than 10 recording er-
rors (n=35 679). After these exclusions, we further removed
individuals whose questionnaire was filled in by someone else
on their behalf (n=15 760). We excluded 4849 subjects report-
ing extreme daily total energy intake defined as more than 2
interquartile ranges above the 75th percentile or below the 25th
percentile and 140 people who had zero person-years of follow-
up. After all exclusions, our analytic cohort comprised 322 263
men and 223 390 women.

tervals (CIs) with time since entry into the study as the under-
lying time metric using Cox proportional hazards regression
models. Quintile cut points were based on the entire cohort,
and multivariate-adjusted HRs are reported using the lowest
quintile as the referent category. The violation of the propor-
tional hazard assumption was investigated by testing an inter-
action between a time-dependent binary covariate, which in-
dicated if follow-up was in the first 5 years or in the second 5
years, and the quintile terms for meat consumption. Dietary
variables were energy adjusted using the nutrient density
method, and meat variables in each model added up to total
meat (addition model). For example, one model contained both
red and white meat, while the processed meat model also con-
tained a nonprocessed meat variable.

To address confounding, we used forward stepwise vari-
able selection to include covariates to develop the fully ad-
justed model. Smoking was the largest confounder of the as-
sociation between meat intake and mortality. Physical activity
and education were also important covariates, but not to the same
degree as smoking. The final model included age (continuous);
education (⬍8 years or unknown, 8-11 years, 12 years [high
school], some college, or college graduate); marital status (mar-
ried: yes/no); family history of cancer (yes/no) (cancer mortal-
ity only); race (non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Hispanic/
Asian/Pacific Islander/American Indian/Alaskan native, or
unknown); body mass index (18.5 to ⬍25, 25 to ⬍30, 30 to ⬍35,
ⱖ35 [calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in me-
ters squared]); 31-level smoking history using smoking status
(never, former, or current), time since quitting for former smok-
ers and smoking dose; frequency of vigorous physical activity
(never/rarely, 1-3 times/mo, 1-2 times/wk, 3-4 times/wk, ⱖ5 times/
wk); total energy intake (continuous); alcohol intake (none, 0
to ⬍5, 5 to ⬍15, 15 to ⬍30, ⱖ30 g/d); vitamin supplement user
(ⱖ1 supplement/mo); fruit consumption (0 to ⬍0.7, 0.7 to ⬍1.2,
1.2 to ⬍1.7, 1.7 to ⬍2.5, ⱖ2.5 servings/1000 kcal); vegetable
consumption (0 to ⬍1.3, 1.3 to ⬍1.8, 1.8 to ⬍2.2, 2.2 to ⬍3.0,
ⱖ3.0 servings/1000 kcal); and menopausal hormone therapy
among women in the multivariate models.

In subanalyses, we investigated the relation between meat
intake and mortality by smoking status. We used median val-
ues of each quintile to test for linear trend with 2-sided P val-
ues. We also calculated population-attributable risks as an es-
timate of the percentage of mortality that could be prevented
if individuals adopted intake levels of participants within the
first quintile. This was computed as 1 minus the ratio consist-
ing of the sum of the estimated HR (derived from the Cox pro-
portional hazard regression models) of each member of the co-
hort divided by the sum of the estimated HR for which meat
exposure was assigned to the lowest or highest quintile, de-
pending on which quintile was the ideal level of meat con-
sumption. The population-attributable risk was multiplied by
100 to convert them to a percentage. All statistical analyses were
carried out using Statistical Analytic Systems (SAS) software
(SAS Institute Inc, Cary, North Carolina).

RESULTS

During 10 years of follow-up, there were 47 976 male
deaths and 23 276 female deaths. In general, those in the
highest quintile of red meat intake tended to consume a
slightly lower amount of white meat but a higher amount
of processed meat compared with those in the lowest quin-
tile. Subjects who consumed more red meat tended to
be married, more likely of non-Hispanic white ethnic-
ity, more likely a current smoker, have a higher body mass

index, and have a higher daily intake of energy, total fat,
and saturated fat, and they tended to have lower educa-
tion and physical activity levels and lower fruit, veg-
etable, fiber, and vitamin supplement intakes (Table 1).

RED MEAT

There was an overall increased risk of total, cancer, and
CVD mortality, as well as all other deaths in both men
(Table 2) and women (Table 3) in the highest com-
pared with the lowest quintile of red meat intake in the
fully adjusted model. There was an increased risk asso-
ciated with death from injuries and sudden death with
higher consumption of red meat in men but not in
women.

WHITE MEAT

When comparing the highest with the lowest quintile of
white meat intake, there was an inverse association for
total mortality and cancer mortality, as well as all other
deaths for both men (Table 2) and women (Table 3). In
contrast, there was a small increase in risk for CVD mor-
tality in men with higher intake of white meat. There was
no association between white meat consumption and
death from injuries and sudden death in men or women.

PROCESSED MEAT

There was an overall increased risk of total, cancer, and CVD
mortality, as well as all other deaths in both men (Table 2)
and women (Table 3) in the highest compared with the low-
est quintile of processed meat intake. In contrast, there was
no association for processed meat intake and death from
injuries and sudden death in either sex.

A lag analysis, excluding deaths occurring in the first
2 years of follow-up, produced results consistent with the
main findings in Table 2 and Table 3. For example, the
HRs for total mortality in men for red meat was as fol-
lows: second quintile HR, 1.05 (95% CI, 1.01-1.09); third
quintile HR, 1.13 (95% CI, 1.09-1.17); fourth quintile
HR, 1.20 (95% CI, 1.16-1.24); and fifth quintile HR, 1.30
(95% CI, 1.26-1.35). For women, the HRs were as fol-

quintile HR, 1.15 (95% CI, 1.11-1.21); fourth quintile
HR, 1.27 (95% CI, 1.21-1.33); and fifth quintile HR, 1.35
(95% CI, 1.28-1.42). Furthermore, we investigated our
models for a violation of the proportional hazard as-
sumption. Proportional hazard assumption was not re-
jected for all analyses except one, the model with red and
white meat among the women for total mortality (P=.008).
On further examination in that model of the relative HR
between the first 5 years of follow-up and the second 5
years of follow-up, the red meat results were consistent
between the 2 follow-up periods. However, for white meat,
the second 5-year period showed less of an inverse trend
compared with the first 5-year period (data not shown).
We investigated whether people who consumed a high-
risk meat diet had mortality risk profiles that were dif-
ferent from people who consumed a low-risk meat diet.
Both men and women who consumed a low-risk meat
diet had statistically significant lower HRs compared with

people who consumed a high-risk meat diet for all-
cause, cancer, and CVD mortality, as well as all other
deaths; for example, for all-cause mortality, the HR for a
low-risk meat diet was 0.92 (95% CI, 0.80-0.94) for men
and 0.80 (95% CI, 0.78-0.84) for women.

To further explore possible confounding by smoking,
we analyzed meat intake and mortality in 2 subgroups—
never smokers (15 413 deaths among 190 135 never smok-
ers) and former/current smokers (n=52 754 deaths among
335 036 former/current smokers). For men, the risks in the
fifth quintile of red meat intake for never and former/
current smokers were as follows: for total mortality, HR,
1.28 (95% CI, 1.19-1.38), and HR, 1.25 (95% CI, 1.20-
1.30), respectively; for cancer mortality, HR, 1.16 (95% CI,

1.02-1.33), and HR, 1.17 (95% CI, 1.09-1.24), respec-
tively; and for CVD mortality, HR, 1.43 (95% CI, 1.25-
1.63), and HR, 1.17 (95% CI, 1.10-1.26), respectively. In
women, the risks in the fifth quintile of red meat intake for
never and former/current smokers were as follows: for total
mortality, HR, 1.36 (95% CI, 1.25-1.48), and HR, 1.28 (95%
CI, 1.21-1.35), respectively; for cancer mortality, HR, 1.10
(95% CI, 0.95-1.27), and HR, 1.16 (95% CI, 1.06-1.27),
respectively; and for CVD mortality, HR, 1.63 (95% CI, 1.38-
1.93), and HR, 1.34 (95% CI, 1.18-1.51), respectively. Risks
were similar for the 2 smoking categories in most in-
stances for processed meat except for cancer mortality, for
which we found a null relation for both sexes in never smok-
ers (men: HR, 1.01 [95% CI, 0.88-1.15]; women: HR, 1.02

[95% CI, 0.89-1.17]), but in former/current smokers we
found higher risks (men: HR, 1.12 [95% CI, 1.05-1.19];
women: HR, 1.11 [95% CI, 1.02-1.21]). Intriguingly, there
was increased risk with higher intake of white meat for CVD
mortality in never smokers (men: HR, 1.24 [95% CI, 1.10-
1.40]; women: HR, 1.20 [95% CI, 1.03-1.41]).

We calculated the population attributable risks, rep-
resenting the percentage of deaths that could be pre-
vented if individuals adopted red or processed meat in-
take levels of participants within the first quintile. For
overall mortality, 11% of deaths in men and 16% of deaths
in women could be prevented if people decreased their
red meat consumption to the level of intake in the first
quintile. The impact on CVD mortality was an 11% de-
crease in men and a 21% decrease in women if the red
meat consumption was decreased to the amount con-
sumed by individuals in the first quintile. The median
red meat consumption based on men and women in the
first quintile was 9.8 g/1000 kcal/d compared with 62.5
g/1000 kcal/d in the fifth quintile. For women eating pro-
cessed meat at the first quintile level, the decrease in CVD
mortality was approximately 20%. The median pro-
cessed meat consumption based on men and women in
the first quintile was 1.6 g/1000 kcal/d compared with
22.6 g/1000 kcal/d in the fifth quintile.

COMMENT

We examined total and cause-specific mortality in rela-
tion to meat consumption in a large prospective study.
We found modest increases in risk for total mortality, as
well as cancer and CVD mortality, with higher intakes
of red and processed meat in both men and women. In
contrast, higher white meat consumption was associ-
ated with a small decrease in total and cancer mortality
in men and women.

The principal strength of this study is the large size
of the cohort, which provided us the ability to investi-
gate the relationship of many deaths (47 976 male deaths
and 23 276 female deaths) within the context of a single
study with a standardized protocol and a wide range of
meat consumption. In contrast, other reports investigat-
ing meat intake in relation to mortality have pooled data
from different studies conducted in California, the United
Kingdom, and Germany because the numbers of events
were limited in each study.1-6,9-14 The protocols and ques-
tionnaires in these studies were different, as were the
populations: Seventh-Day Adventists in California and
vegetarians and nonvegetarians in Europe. Pooled analy-
ses of specialized populations with distinct healthy life-
styles are subject to unmeasured confounding. Further-

more, recall bias and reverse causality were minimized
in our study because diet was assessed prior to the diag-
nosis of the conditions that led to death.

There is a possibility that some residual confounding
by smoking may remain; however, we used a detailed 31-
level smoking history variable and repeated the analyses
within smoking status strata. Within smoking subgroups,
we found consistent results for red, white, and processed
meat intakes; however, there were some intriguing differ-
ences that could be further investigated. We found a posi-
tive association for processed meat intake and cancer mor-
tality among former/current smokers but not among never
smokers. This may be because we were still not able to fully
statistically adjust for residual confounding of smoking be-
cause people who eat processed meat may also smoke. An

additional reason could be that in addition to being ex-
posed to N-nitroso compounds from processed meats,
smokers inhale carcinogenic chemicals. The possible rea-
son why there was an increased risk with white meat con-
sumption among never smokers is not readily apparent.
Because our cohort was predominantly non-
Hispanic white, more educated, consumed less fat and
red meat and more fiber and fruits and vegetables, and
had fewer current smokers than similarly aged adults in
the US population, caution should be applied when at-
tempting to generalize our findings to other popula-
tions,7 although this caution is somewhat tempered be-
cause it is unlikely that the mechanisms relating meat to
mortality differ quantitatively between our study popu-
lation and other white populations older than 50 years.

fMedian white meat intake based on men and women (g/1000 kcal): Q1, 9.5; Q2, 18.4; Q3, 27.4; Q4, 39.4; and Q5, 64.6.
gMedian processed meat intake based on men and women (g/1000 kcal): Q1, 1.6; Q2, 4.4; Q3, 7.4; Q4, 12.2; and Q5, 22.6.

Furthermore, the population-attributable risks in our co-
hort may be conservative estimates because red and pro-
cessed meat consumption may be higher in the general
population than in our cohort.

The inherent limitations of measurement error in this
study are similar to those of any nutritional epidemio-
logic study that is based on recall of usual intake over a
given period. We attempted to reduce measurement er-
ror by adjusting our models for reported energy in-
take.15 The correlations for red meat consumption as-
sessed from the food frequency questionnaire compared
with two 24-hour recall diaries were 0.62 for men and
0.70 for women, as reported previously by Schatzkin et
al.7 The problem of residual confounding may still exist
and could explain the relatively small associations found
throughout this study despite the care taken to adjust for
known confounders.

Overall, we did not find statistically significant asso-
ciation between meat consumption and deaths from in-
jury and sudden deaths in most instances. The relative
HRs of meat consumption with the other causes of death
(total, cancer, and CVD mortality) were similar in mag-
nitude in some cases to those of deaths from injury and
sudden deaths; however, the number of deaths from in-

jury and sudden deaths was less than the other causes of
deaths, and thus the HRs were generally not statistically
significant. We observed a higher risk with the category
that included “all other deaths”; this is a broad category
with many heterogeneous conditions (eg, diabetes melli-
tus, Alzheimer disease, stomach and duodenal ulcers,
chronic liver disease, cirrhosis, nephritis, nephrotic syn-
drome, and nephrosis), some of which may be posi-
tively related to meat intake.

There are various mechanisms by which meat may be
related to mortality. In relation to cancer, meat is a source
of several multisite carcinogens, including heterocyclic
amines and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons,16-21 which
are both formed during high-temperature cooking of meat,
as well as N-nitroso compounds.22,23 Iron in red meat may
increase oxidative damage and increase the formation of
N-nitroso compounds.24-27 Furthermore, meat is a ma-
jor source of saturated fat, which has been positively as-
sociated with breast28-30 and colorectal cancer.31

In relation to CVD, elevated blood pressure has been
shown to be positively associated with higher intakes of
red and processed meat, even though the mechanism is
unclear, except that possibly meat may substitute for other
beneficial foods such as grains, fruits, or vegetables.32 Mean

terol, very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and tri-
glyceride levels were found to be decreased in subjects
who substituted red meat with fish.33,34 Vegetarians have
lower arachidonic, eicosapentaenoic, and docosahexae-
noic acid levels and higher linoleate and antioxidant lev-
els in platelet phospholipids; such a biochemical profile
may be related to decreased atherogenesis and throm-
bogenesis.34-36

Red and processed meat intakes, as well as a high-
risk meat diet, were associated with a modest increase
in risk of total mortality, cancer, and CVD mortality in
both men and women. In contrast, high white meat in-
take and a low-risk meat diet was associated with a small
decrease in total and cancer mortality. These results
complement the recommendations by the American In-
stitute for Cancer Research and the World Cancer Re-
search Fund to reduce red and processed meat intake to
decrease cancer incidence.31 Future research should in-
vestigate the relation between subtypes of meat and spe-
cific causes of mortality.

Purpose of review
To clarify the role of dietary pattern on prognosis in breast cancer survivors.
Recent ﬁndings
Observational trials show mixed results that do not strongly support an independent role
for dietary pattern in prognosis. Women’s Intervention Nutrition Study and Women’s
Healthy Eating and Living (WHEL) are two large randomized controlled trials that
address this question. The interventions from both studies achieved signiﬁcant
reductions in energy from fat, and the WHEL Study achieved large increases in
vegetables, fruit and ﬁber. Women’s Intervention Nutrition Study examined
postmenopausal women only and reported a not-quite-signiﬁcant improved prognosis
for women in the intervention group, with the beneﬁt focused on ipsilateral localized
recurrences, but little improvement in the more important distal recurrences. This review
considers only WHEL postmenopausal women to aid a direct comparison with
Women’s Intervention Nutrition Study. The WHEL Study reported a convincing lack of
association between diet and prognosis. However, a secondary analysis suggests that
the dietary intervention reduced distal recurrences among the subgroup without hot
ﬂashes at baseline.
Summary
There is no convincing evidence that changing dietary pattern following breast cancer
diagnosis will improve prognosis for most women with early stage breast cancer.
However, it would appear to be important for some subgroups. Further investigation of
mechanisms for such selective action is needed.

Introduction
Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers among
women in developed countries, and signiﬁcant advances
in early detection and treatment have led to high 10-year
survival rates and large prevalent survivor populations.
Clinical outcome among women diagnosed with appar-
ently similar cancers varies considerably, and does not
appear to be explained by treatment differences. Labora-
tory studies have identiﬁed multiple bioactive constitu-
ents in foods that appear to either promote carcinogenesis
or protect against it. As a result, there is considerable
interest in the question of whether dietary pattern can
inﬂuence a woman’s prognosis following breast cancer.

Prospective observational studies, or cohort studies,
measure the dietary component or pattern and then
monitor prognosis over time. These association studies

do not provide sufﬁcient evidence to conclude that
changing dietary pattern would alter prognosis. The ‘gold
standard’ studies are randomized trials in which some
participants are assigned to make a major dietary change.
Several prospective observational studies have investi-
gated the link between dietary pattern and breast cancer
prognosis, and to date, two randomized clinical trials have
tested this association.

Observational studies
Most dietary studies, however, are compromised by
measurement errors in the commonly used self-reported
dietary patterns [1], and there are few proven biomarkers
of exposure to validate self-report. The extent of these
measurement errors has been highlighted by two separate
studies that have demonstrated that different self-
report methods change the study outcome [2,3]. Another

study showed an effect with a biomarker that was not
seen with self-reported intake [4,5].

Reviews of the observational studies of diet and breast
cancer prognosis have identiﬁed 14 studies since 1990
[6,7,8,9–21]. However, many of these studies measured
prebreast cancer dietary pattern shortly following diag-
nosis with breast cancer. As diets commonly change
following diagnosis [22], dietary recalls over extended
periods that include diagnosis have additional measure-
ment problems and are excluded from this review.

In 1994, the Canadian National Breast Screening Study
reported 5-year survival data from the subsample of 678
breast cancer cases that had completed a diet history prior
to diagnosis [23]. In this study, lower saturated fat intake
(but not intake of total fat or oleic acid) was associated
with survival, and women in the highest versus lowest
quartiles of intake of b carotene and vitamin C from food
sources appeared protected.

The Nurses’ Health Study is a well-known long-term
investigation of a cohort of female registered nurses.
Holmes et al. [15] reported on a subsample (n¼ 1982)
who were diagnosed with breast cancer from 1976 to 1990
and completed a dietary assessment in the postdiagnosis
period and followed through 1994. Consumption of fruit,
red meat or grain-based products was not associated with
either all-cause mortality or breast carcinoma death.
However, among women with metastatic cancer, con-
sumption of vegetables, carotenoids and ﬁber had lower
mortality rates. Kroenke et al. [17] reported on the 2619
nurses who were diagnosed from 1982 to 1998 and
completed a dietary questionnaire at least 1 year after
diagnosis. Over a median follow-up of 9 years, 9% of
participants died from breast cancer. Using factor
analysis,
researchers identiﬁed two dietary patterns:
one in which vegetables, fruit, whole grains, low fat dairy,
poultry, ﬁsh and ﬁber consumption increased across
quintiles (prudent dietary pattern), and the other in
which consumption of reﬁned grains, red meat, processed
meat, high-fat dairy, saturated fat and dessert increased
across quintiles (western dietary pattern). Neither dietary
pattern was related to breast cancer mortality. However,
the prudent dietary pattern reduced and Western dietary
pattern increased deaths from other causes. Thus, the
no-association result for dietary fat consumption was
consistent across these two overlapping cohorts, but
the conclusions for a mortality association with the con-
sumption of vegetables, fruit and ﬁber were not.

The Women’s Healthy Eating and Living (WHEL)
Study reported observational data from women random-
ized to the comparison group. Dietary assessment
occurred an average of 2 years after diagnosis, and dietary
patterns were validated with a plasma carotenoid con-

centration, the accepted biomarker of vegetable and fruit
intake. The ﬁrst report [19] focused on 205 women who
had a breast cancer event prior to June 2004 (average of
5 years follow-up), and identiﬁed those in the lowest
baseline tertile (compared to all others) of circulating
carotenoid concentrations as having an approximate 40%
increased risk. The second report [24] focused on over-
all mortality and included follow-up through December
2005. No association was found for energy from fat.
Vegetable–fruit consumption and physical activity were
weakly associated by themselves, but there was an inter-
action between them with the combination of vegetable–
fruit intake (at least 5 vegetables and fruits/day), and
physical activity (equivalent
to walking briskly for
30 min, 6 days a week) reduced the risk of dying from
breast cancer by half, regardless of weight, although fewer
obese women were physically active with a healthy
dietary pattern (16 versus 30%). The effect was stronger
in women who had hormone receptor-positive cancers.

Comparing Women’s Healthy Eating and Living and
Women’s Intervention Nutrition Study randomized trials
Both the Women’s Intervention Nutrition Study (WINS)
and the WHEL Study randomized women who had been
diagnosed with early stage breast cancer in the United
States during the period from 1990 to 1999, before the
widespread use of aromatase inhibitors. Both studies
excluded stage I patients with <1 cm tumors, but there
were three important differences in the eligibility criteria.
The ﬁrst was age: WINS enrolled postmenopausal
women aged 48–79 years at diagnosis, whereas WHEL
enrolled women aged 18–70 years. However, to compare
studies, it is possible to categorize WHEL participants by
menopausal status (Table 1). Both the WHEL (n¼ 2448)
and the WINS (n¼ 2437) studies had almost equiva-
lently-sized populations of postmenopausal women.

The second difference was the time between diagnosis
and enrollment. WINS enrolled women within 1 year of
diagnosis, whereas the WHEL Study enrolled women
within 4 years of diagnosis (Table 1). Thus, the WHEL
Study undersampled the population who would recur
within 4 years of diagnosis and is really a study of breast
cancer events between 2 and 10 years from diagnosis [25].
WINS, on the contrary, is focused much more on breast
cancer events within the ﬁrst 5 years from diagnosis.
The third difference was that WINS excluded women
with worse prognoses (based on tumor size and nodes),
whereas WHEL postmenopausal women had more
advanced cancer characteristics at diagnosis. Over half
of WINS participants were stage I compared with just
over a third of the WHEL sample, and 25% of WHEL
women were stage IIB or IIIA, compared with only 10%
of WINS. In both studies, about one-ﬁfth of postmeno-
pausal women had estrogen receptor-negative tumors at
diagnosis.

Despite the above differences in cancer characteristics,
both studies recruited breast cancer survivors from similar
populations. Socio-demographic characteristics of WINS
and WHEL participants were markedly similar (Table 2)
in terms of age (55 versus 58 years), race (85% were
Caucasian) and education (almost 50% college gradu-
ates). Approximately 27% of postmenopausal participants
in both studies were obese, and the mean energy intake
from fat was 29%.

These WINS and WHEL comparisons include WHEL
participants who were premenopausal and perimenopau-
sal. These women were younger, more highly educated
and less likely to be obese (Table 2). They were also
more likely to be recruited in the ﬁrst year and more
likely to be estrogen receptor negative (Table 1).

intake [26] (Table 3). Although it appeared that this
between-group difference was maintained through 5 years,
the low response rate for dietary assessments makes this
result questionable (year 3 response approximately 70%;
year 5 response approximately 40%). In reporting a com-
pleters-only analysis, the authors assumed that diets of the
large proportion of nonrespondents were similar to the
diets of the respondents – a very questionable assumption.
Using a more conservative assumption (that nonrespon-
dents didn’t lower their fat intake), an estimate of the
between-group difference is approximately 6% at year 3
and 3.5% at year 5. WINS also reported that the interven-
tion group lost weight, resulting in a between-group
difference of 2.3 kg in year 1 (conservative assump-
tion¼ approximately 1.6 kg) to 2.7 kg in year 5 (conser-
vative assumption¼ approximately 1.1 kg).

The effect of the Women’s Intervention Nutrition Study
intervention
Both the WINS and the WHEL studies used sets of four
24 h recalls to assess current dietary pattern at multiple
points in time. The WINS intervention focused on redu-
cing fat intake to 15% of energy. At 1 year, the intervention
reported a 9% between-group difference in dietary fat

The effect of the Women’s Healthy Eating and Living
Study intervention
The WHEL Study intervention encouraged women to
adopt a daily dietary pattern including ﬁve vegetable
servings, 16 oz of vegetable juice, three fruit servings,
30 g of ﬁber and 20% energy from fat. Unlike WINS,
there was only a small decline in completion rates for

dietary assessment and 85% were assessed at year 6
(Table 4). The study has presented dietary change data
in two ways: using a completers-only analysis [24] as
well as with the conservative assumption that nonrespon-
ders did not change their dietary pattern [27].

To compare dietary change with WINS, we present the
completers-only data in Table 4 [24]. The intervention
was associated with a between-group difference of 4.7
vegetable–fruit servings/day at 1 year that decreased to 3
servings/day by 6 years. The between-group difference
for ﬁber consumption was 8 g/day at year 1, decreasing to
5 g/day at year 6. The between-group difference in
energy from fat was 5.7% at 1 year, decreasing to 3.5%
at 6 years, similar to the conservative estimate of the
WINS intervention effect. Body weight changed little
over 6 years. The conservative analysis concluded that, at
4 years, the relative between-group differences were 65%
for vegetables (including juice), 25% for fruit, 30% for
ﬁber and 13% for energy from fat.

Study outcomes: Women’s Intervention Nutrition Study
versus Women’s Healthy Eating and Living Study
The WINS and the WHEL studies have reported con-
ﬂicting results. WINS assessed the summary variable ‘any
breast cancer event’ for their analysis and the 2.6%
between-group difference was borderline signiﬁcant in
the planned stratiﬁed log rank test (P¼ 0.077), although
statistically signiﬁcant in the multivariate Cox model
(P¼ 0.034) [26]. Further, an exploratory analysis suggested
that the between-group differences in breast cancer events
might be conﬁned to the 20% of the sample with initial
tumors that were estrogen receptor negative; however, the
interaction between dietary intervention and hormone
receptor status was not statistically signiﬁcant.

The WHEL Study [24] reported no between-group
differences in either any breast cancer event [adjusted
Hazard Ratio (HRadj)¼ 0.63] or in overall mortality
(HRadj¼ 0.43). Additionally, for breast cancer events,
the likelihood ratio tests for baseline dietary pattern by
study group interaction were not signiﬁcant for veg-
etable–fruit, ﬁber or energy from fat. However, for over-
all mortality, the likelihood ratio test was signiﬁcant for
quartiles of energy from fat (P¼ 0.04), although the effect
seemed to be only in the second quartile of baseline
energy from fat, and the intervention group difference
was not in a protective direction. Further, hormone
receptor status did not differ between groups (P¼ 0.85).

Given the considerable similarities between these
randomized trials, the marked difference in these ﬁndings
requires further investigation. Table 5 presents details
of the different study outcomes for postmenopausal
women. As expected, from the initial cancer characteristics
(Table 1) and the longer follow-up period, WHEL
reported more study events than WINS (Table 5) and
particularly more distal recurrences that Tang [28] has
argued are the most important study outcomes for patients
with a preexisting breast cancer diagnosis. The size of the
between-group difference in these distal recurrences was
not that different for both of these studies (WINS¼ 1.1,
WHEL¼ 0.9).

The difference in the studies occurred in the between-
group differences in the proportion of women who had
local recurrences and new primary breast cancer events
(WINS¼ 1.3%, WHEL¼þ0.5%), and, in particular,
the WINS group effect was among women who had a
lumpectomy for their initial cancer and had an ipsilateral
breast cancer recurrence during the follow-up period

(comparison¼ 2.1%; intervention¼ 1.1%). It is possible
that the lack of a WHEL effect in this subpopulation of
women reﬂected the fact that WHEL underestimated
events in the ﬁrst few years from diagnosis. Another
plausible explanation is that this ﬁnding is an artifact,
particularly as the main hypothesis was only marginally
statistically signiﬁcant.

Women’s Healthy Eating and Living Study secondary
analysis
The initial WHEL Study protocol [25] postulated that
diet could affect prognosis by reducing circulating estrogen
concentrations. The study’s nested case–control analysis
showed that women with higher circulating estradiol con-
centrations at baseline were less likely to report hot ﬂashes
at that time and more likely to have a secondary cancer
event during the follow-up period [29]. In two separate
studies, early stage breast cancer survivors who did not
report hot ﬂashes shortly after treatment were approxi-
mately 30% more likely to have additional breast cancer
events [30,31]. Given that the WHEL Study intervention
has been shown to reduce circulating estrogen concen-
trations [32], the study undertook a secondary analysis to
see whether an intervention effect may have been limited
to this group of women who did not report hot ﬂashes at
baseline [33].
About one-third of WHEL participants (n¼ 900) were in
the subgroup who did not report hot ﬂashes at baseline
(no hot ﬂash subgroup) [24,33]. The intervention
participants in this no hot ﬂash subgroup had a similarly
large change in dietary pattern (vegetables, fruit, ﬁber
and energy from fat) over the course of the study to that
seen in the overall intervention group. Among the no hot
ﬂash subgroup, 76.4% of the comparison group and 83.9%
of the intervention group remained breast cancer free
(P¼ 0.002). This effect was almost entirely restricted to
the distal recurrence group (comparison¼ 15.9%, inter-
vention¼ 9.4%), and the approximately 60% lower event
rate in the intervention group was not explained by other

variables in a series of sensitivity analyses [33]. This
effect did not differ signiﬁcantly by hormone receptor
status (P¼ 0.63).

Conclusion
The evidence from prospective observational studies is
mixed particularly for vegetable–fruit–ﬁber consumption,
though more consistently negative for fat consumption.
Two randomized trials have been reported: WINS focused
on the dietary fat hypothesis, whereas WHEL focused on a
plant-based dietary pattern that included a reduction in
dietary fat. WHEL reported that the comprehensive
dietary change had no effect on prognosis, whereas WINS
found a marginal positive effect from changing fat.

This review compares postmenopausal participants from
these studies, focusing on what might explain the differ-
ent results. Both studies indicate that dietary pattern is
not a strong ‘across the board’ predictor of prognosis.
Each study suggests that the dietary pattern may be
effective within a subgroup of people. Further investi-
gation of subgroups is required, particularly focused on
population evidence of the mechanism by which these
dietary patterns may impact prognosis.

                       Background:   Preclinical and observational studies suggest a 
relationship between dietary fat intake and breast cancer, 
but the association remains controversial. We carried out a 
randomized,  prospective,  multicenter  clinical  trial  to  test 
the  effect  of  a  dietary  intervention  designed  to  reduce  fat 
intake  in  women  with  resected,  early-stage  breast  cancer 
receiving  conventional  cancer  management.    Methods:    A 
total  of  2437  women  were  randomly  assigned  between 
February  1994  and  January  2001  in  a  ratio  of  40  :  60  to 
dietary intervention (n = 975) or control (n = 1462) groups. 
An interim analysis was performed after a median follow-
up of 60 months when funding for the intervention ceased. 
Mean differences between dietary intervention and control 
groups  in  nutrient  intakes  and  anthropometric  variables 
were compared with   t   tests. Relapse-free survival was exam-
ined using Kaplan – Meier analysis, stratiﬁ ed log-rank tests, 
and Cox proportional hazards models. Statistical tests were 
two-sided.   Results:   Dietary fat intake was lower in the inter-
vention  than  in  the  control  group  (fat  grams/day  at  12 
months, 33.3 [95% conﬁ dence interval {CI} = 32.2 to 34.5] 
versus 51.3 [95% CI = 50.0 to 52.7], respectively;   P  <.001), 
corresponding  to  a  statistically  signiﬁ cant  (  P    =  .005), 
6-pound lower mean body weight in the intervention group. 
A total of 277 relapse events (local, regional, distant, or ipsi-
lateral breast cancer recurrence or new contralateral breast 
cancer) have been reported in 96 of 975 (9.8%) women in 
the  dietary  group  and  181  of  1462  (12.4%)  women  in  the 
control  group.  The  hazard  ratio  of  relapse  events  in  the 
intervention  group  compared  with  the  control  group  was 
0.76 (95% CI = 0.60 to 0.98,   P   = .077 for stratiﬁ ed log rank 
and   P   = .034 for adjusted Cox model analysis). Exploratory 
analyses suggested a differential effect of the dietary inter-
vention based on hormonal receptor status.   Conclusions:   A 
lifestyle intervention reducing dietary fat intake, with mod-
est inﬂ uence on body weight, may improve relapse-free sur-
vival of breast cancer patients re ceiving conventional cancer 
management.  Longer,  ongoing  nonintervention  follow-up 
will address original protocol design plans, which called for 
3 years of follow-up after completion of recruitment.   [J Natl 
Cancer Inst 2006;98: 1767  –  76 ]   

  The  question  of  the  inﬂ uence  of  dietary  fat  on  breast 
cancer has been controversial. Whereas preclinical and human 

ecologic studies have suggested an association of higher di-
etary  fat  intake  with  breast  cancer  risk   ( 1 , 2 ) ,  cohort  studies 
have reported less consistent effects  ( 3  –  5 ) . Similarly, observa-
tional studies of dietary fat inﬂ uence on breast cancer recur-
rence have had mixed results  ( 6 , 7 ) , with some suggesting that 
higher fat intake is associated with higher risk of recurrence, 
especially in postmenopausal women  ( 8  –  10 ) . The varying as-
sociations may be due to the modest range of fat intake seen 
and the difﬁ culty in accurately measuring fat intake with cur-
rent methods  ( 11 , 12 ) . 

 Feasibility trials have demonstrated that dietary fat reduction 
can  be  achieved  within  the  context  of  standard  multimodality 
breast  cancer  management  (  13 , 14  ). The Women’s  Intervention 
Nutrition Study (WINS) was subsequently designed to test the 
hypothesis  that  a  dietary  intervention  targeting  fat  intake

sected breast cancer. 

  P ATIENTS  AND  M ETHODS  

  Study Overview 

 In this phase III multicenter randomized trial, the effect on 
relapse of a dietary intervention designed to reduce fat intake 
was compared with that of a control condition with minimal 
 dietary counseling in women with early-stage, resected breast 
cancer receiving conventional cancer management. Patients in 
this  study  were  accrued  in  approximately  7  years,  between 
February  1994  and  January  2001.  This  report  represents  an 
interim analysis after a median of 60 months of follow-up. The 
WINS trial protocol is available online as supplementary data 
at    http://jncicancerspectrum.oxfordjournals.org/jnci/content/
vol98/issue24  .  

  Study Population 

 Women  were  recruited  from  39  clinical  centers.  Eligibility 
criteria  included  histologically  conﬁ rmed,  resected,  unilateral 
invasive breast carcinoma; lymph node evaluation; age between 
48 and 79 years; life expectancy of at least 10 years excluding 
the cancer diagnosis; acceptable adjuvant systemic therapy (see 
below);  at  least  20%  of  calories  obtained  from  fat;  medically 
able to accept either randomization assignment; and trial entry 
within 365 days of surgery. Exclusion criteria included inﬂ am-
matory carcinoma; chest wall or skin involved; tumor size less 
than 1 cm with negative nodes; tumor size greater than 5 cm with 
positive nodes; 10 or more nodes positive; preoperative chemo-
therapy; or any previous neoplasm other than carcinoma in situ 
of the cervix or basal cell skin carcinoma. Eligibility was con-
ﬁ rmed by central review of medical records and pathology re-
ports.  The  Institutional  Review  Board  of  each  participating 
institution approved the study protocol. All patients gave written 
informed consent.  

  Standard Breast Cancer Management 

 Standard  breast  cancer  management  was  protocol  de  ﬁ ned, 
including adequate surgery and radiotherapy. Estrogen receptor 
(ER)  and  progesterone  receptor  (PgR)  status  (positive  or 
negative) was deﬁ ned by local laboratory standards. Women with 
ER-positive  tumors  received  tamoxifen  (20  mg  per  day)  for  5 
years. Chemotherapy with a protocol-approved regimen (adria-
mycin plus cyclophosphamide; cyclophosphamide plus metho-
trexate  plus  5-ﬂ uorouracil  in  two  schedules;  5-ﬂ uorouracil 
plus  adriamycin  plus  cyclophosphamide  in  two  schedules  [5-
 ﬂ uoruracil – adriamycin – cyclophosphamide or cyclophosphamide
 – adriamycin – fluorouracil]; or adriamycin – cyclophosphamide 
followed by paclitaxel) was required for women with ER- negative 
tumors  and  optional  for  those  with  ER-positive  tumors. As  an 
eligibility  criterion,  chemotherapy  had  to  be  initiated  within  4 
months  after  diagnosis  for  women  given  chemotherapy,  and 
tamoxifen had to be initiated within 6 months after diagnosis for 
those  given  only  tamoxifen.  Recommended  drug  dosages  and 
schedules paralleled those in use by cooperative group trials at 
the time  ( 15  –  17 ).   

  Randomization 

 Adaptive randomization was carried out at the Statistical Co-
ordinating Unit of the WINS study using a random stratiﬁ ed per-
muted block design. The trial was designed with an unbalanced 
randomization (60% control subjects, 40% dietary intervention 
subjects) to facilitate resource allocation to the dietary interven-
tion. Women  were  initially  stratiﬁ ed  according  to  lymph  node 
status  (negative  or  positive)  and  systemic  adjuvant  therapy 
 received  (tamoxifen  alone,  tamoxifen  plus  chemotherapy,  or 
 chemotherapy  alone). An  additional  stratum  for  sentinel  node 
evaluation (yes or no) was introduced in 1999 to reﬂ ect clinical 
practice trends.  

  Dietary Intervention and Study Assessments 

 The goal of the dietary intervention was to reduce percentage 
of  calories  from  fat  to  15%  while  maintaining  nutritional 
adequacy. Feasibility studies had indicated that this goal would 
result in a sustained reduction in fat intake to approximately 20% 
of calories  ( 14 ) , which was the basis for the sample size calcula-
tion.  Women  in  the  dietary  intervention  group  were  given  an 
individual fat gram goal and counseled by registered dieticians 
who  implemented  a  previously  developed  low-fat  eating  plan 
 ( 14  –  18 ) .  Study  dieticians  were  trained  centrally  on  diet  inter-
vention and dietary and anthropometric data collection. Training 
continued with annual workshops incorporating training on mo-
tivational interviewing and with monthly conference calls. 

 The low-fat eating plan, which was based on nutritional and 
behavioral science principles  ( 18 ) , incorporated social cognitive 
theory and included self-monitoring (fat gram counting and re-
cording), goal setting, modeling, social support, and relapse pre-
vention and management. Individual fat gram goals were based 
on energy intake needed to maintain weight, and no counseling 
on weight reduction was provided. The low-fat eating plan was 
initiated during eight biweekly individual, in-person counseling 
sessions, each lasting approximately 1 hour. Subsequent dietician 
contacts (visits or calls) occurred every 3 months, with available, 
optional monthly dietary group sessions. Women in the dietary 
intervention group were instructed to keep a written record of 
their fat gram intake daily throughout the trial using a previously 
developed  “ keeping score ”  book  ( 18 ) . Control subjects had one 
baseline  dietician  visit  and  contacts  with  a  dietician  every  3 
months  subsequently.  They  received  written  information  on 
general  dietary  guidelines  and  were  counseled  on  nutritional 
adequacy for vitamin and mineral intake only. 

 Questionnaires administered at baseline were used to collect 
information on demographic characteristics; medical, reproduc-
tive,  and  family  history;  personal  habits  such  as  smoking  and 
alcohol use; prior use of menopausal hormone therapy and oral 
contraceptives;  and  current  use  of  medications  and  dietary 
supplements. Weight and height were measured at baseline and 
annually using standardized techniques on calibrated scales/stadi-
ometer  ( 19 ) . Body mass index (BMI) was calculated as weight (in 
kilograms) divided by height (in meters) squared. 

 Unannounced telephone calls were used to estimate dietary 
intakes. Trained interviewers who were blinded to randomization 
status collected dietary information; the information was entered 
into the Nutrition Data System for Research interactive software 
as  previously  described   ( 18 ) .  A  multilayered  quality  control 
process was used to maintain nutrition data quality  ( 20 ) . Data on

dietary  intakes  from  three  follow-up  calls  (including  one  on  a 
weekend day) were collected over 2 weeks for eligibility deter-
mination regarding dietary fat intake. Two additional follow-up 
calls (including one on a weekend day) were made annually to 
collect updated data on dietary intakes for all women. 

 Recurrence  information  was  solicited  during  the  every-3-
month dietician contacts. Recurrences were conﬁ rmed initially 
by medical record and pathology report review by the clinical 
director  (RTC)  and  subsequently  by  the  WINS  Pathology 
 Committee, both of whom were blinded to random assignment.  

  Outcome Deﬁ nitions 

 The primary study endpoint was relapse-free survival, deﬁ ned 
as the time from random assignment to breast cancer recurrence 
at any site. Relapse events included local, regional, and distant 
recurrence; ipsilateral breast recurrence after lumpectomy; and 
contralateral breast cancer. Overall survival, deﬁ ned as the time 
from randomization to death from any cause, was a secondary 
endpoint. For comparability to other adjuvant trials  ( 15 , 21  –  24 ) , 
disease-free  survival  and  recurrence-free  survival  were  also 
examined. Disease-free survival events included any secondary 
invasive  cancers,  excluding  basal  and  squamous  skin  cancers, 
and  death  without  breast  cancer  recurrence.  Recurrence-free 
survival  events  included  local,  regional,  distant,  or  ipsilateral 
breast  recurrence  after  lumpectomy  but  excluded  contralateral 
breast cancer. Breast cancer size and nodal status were used to 
calculate tumor size – node – metastasis stage  ( 25 )  at baseline.  

  Termination of the Dietary Intervention 

 WINS  was  supported  by  a  multicenter  RO1  grant  from  the 
National Cancer Institute, with continued funding dependent on 
ongoing  peer  review.  Funding  for  the  clinical  centers  and  the 
active dietary intervention ended in May 2004, even though the 
protocol-deﬁ ned follow-up period had not been completed and 
even  though  secular  trends  in  therapy  had  reduced  recurrence 
events compared with the number of events projected at the time 
the study was designed. The WINS External Advisory Commit-
tee reviewed results of the last (November 2003) interim analysis 
(which incorporated nutrient data through August 31, 2003, and 
all  available  efﬁ cacy  data  through  October  31,  2003),  after  a 
median  follow-up  of  60  months.  Based  on  the  change  in  trial 
status,  both  the  WINS  External  Advisory  Committee  and  the 
WINS  Executive  Committee  supported  reporting  the  available 
results but recognized the need for additional follow-up. These 
results were presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncol-
ogy annual meeting  ( 26 )  on May 17, 2005, and were provided to 
study participants by mail. This interim efﬁ cacy report provides 
details of that dataset. The protocol design called for 3 years of 
follow-up after completion of recruitment through January 2004. 
Currently  ongoing  nonintervention  follow-up  will  address  the 
original design plans.  

  Statistical Analysis 

 Sample size was based on a model that generated power esti-
mates via simulation. Using published information from cooper-
ative group trials involving tamoxifen  ( 27 , 28  ), we calculated a 
total sample size of 2502 under assumptions of 6 years of ac-
crual,  3  years  of  follow-up  after  completion  of  accrual,  and  a 

7.5% increase in relapse-free survival with a drop-in (deﬁ ned as 
control group women with intake <20% of calories from fat at 
any interval while on study) rate of 10% and a drop-out rate of 
30% for 84% power at a two-sided alpha level of .05. 

 The primary efﬁ cacy analysis was a stratiﬁ ed log-rank test. 
Exploratory  Cox  proportional  hazards  models  for  relapse-free 
survival  were  investigated,  as  were  various  Cox  models  for 
prognostic  factors  in  addition  to  those  used  in  the  stratiﬁ ed 
randomization. The ﬁ nal Cox model included randomized group, 
stratiﬁ cation  factors  (ER  status  [positive  versus  negative]  and 
tumor size [<2 versus  ≥ 2 cm]), and surgery type (mastectomy 
versus  lumpectomy)  based  on  their  established  inﬂ uences  on 
breast cancer outcomes. The cumulative incidence method was 
applied for Cox model analyses. Model assessment suggested a 
reasonable data ﬁ t. The assumption of proportionality for Cox 
models was veriﬁ ed by graphical and numerical methods of Lin 
et al.  ( 29 ) . The  P  value for the Kolmogorov-type supremum test 
(for group) based on 1000 simulations was 0.5170, supporting 
the proportional hazards assumptions. 

 Analyses included all randomly assigned patients, following 
the intent-to-treat paradigm. All  P  values were derived from a 
two-sided  test  for  signiﬁ cance.  The  95%  conﬁ dence  interval 
(CI) for the hazard ratio (HR) was obtained for each term in the 
ﬁ nal Cox model, with particular attention to the interaction be-
tween treatment and other factors in the model. The  P  values and 
conﬁ dence intervals are exploratory. Five protocol-planned in-
terim  analyses  were  carried  out  between  February  2000  and 
November 2003. The Haybitle – Peto approach to the  α -spending 
function  was  used  to  account  for  interim  analyses   ( 30 ) .  The 
Kaplan – Meier method was used to calculate probability estimates 
for  relapse-free  and  overall  survival.  In  exploratory  analyses, 
which were not deﬁ ned prospectively, dietary effects on relapse-
free survival in subgroups based on BMI, hormone receptor sta-
tus, and nodal status were examined using the Cox model. Tests 
for interaction used Cox models and a likelihood ratio test. Dif-
ferences in baseline variables between and within groups were 
analyzed using  t  tests or paired  t  tests or the appropriate tests 
with categorical variables. The  t  tests were performed to com-
pare  differences  in  the  nutrient  intakes  and  anthropometric 
variables, and corresponding 95% conﬁ dence intervals are reported.   

  R ESULTS  

 A  total  of  2437  apparently  eligible  women  were  randomly 
 assigned, 975 to the dietary intervention group and 1462 to the 
control  group  ( Fig.  1 ).  Thirty-four  women  (12  in  the  dietary 
group and 22 in the control group) were subsequently found to 
be ineligible, most commonly based on a longer interval from 
diagnosis and/or use of other chemotherapy (n = 10), pagetoid 
nipple  involvement  (n  =  9),  or  size  or  margin  issues  (n  =  5). 
However, all randomly assigned patients are included in the pre-
sented analyses.     

 The  characteristics  of  the  participants  were  well  balanced 
across the two groups ( Table 1 ). The characteristics of the breast 
cancers  of  study  participants  and  the  therapy  given  for  these 
cancers by treatment group are provided in  Table 2 . Breast can-
cer characteristics were closely comparable in the two groups. 
Breast cancer therapy was also closely comparable in the two 
groups, except for the type of primary surgery. More women in 
the dietary intervention compared to control group had mastec-
tomy rather than breast-conserving therapy ( P  = .004).

 As of October 31, 2003, 95% of the women in the dietary in-
tervention group and 94% of those in the control group were be-
ing  followed  as  part  of  the  study  or  had  experienced  a  study 
event, with 84% of women in the dietary intervention group and 
89% of those in the control group contacted within 12 months of 
October  31,  2003  ( Fig.  1 ).  The  median  interval  between  last 
contact and the analysis closeout date was 2.6 months for women 
in the  dietary intervention group and 3.1 months for those in the 
control group. 

and supplement use. No adverse events were associated with 
the dietary intervention.     

 Body  weight  was  not  an  intervention  target.  However, 
there was a modest but statistically signiﬁ cant ( P  = .005) weight 
difference  of  about  6  pounds  between  groups,  with  dietary 
 intervention women weighing less through 5 years of observa-
tion. Changes in BMI in both groups reﬂ ect the weight changes 
observed ( Table 3 ).  

  Adherence to Dietary Intervention 

  Efﬁ cacy 

 The  dietary  intervention  adherence  results  are  based  on 
telephone  follow-up  calls. The  reported  dietary  intake  differ-
ences by randomization group over time are outlined in  Table 3 . 
In all, 80% of women provided dietary data for at least three 
time periods after baseline. After 1 year, mean daily fat gram 
intake was slightly reduced in the control group (from 56.3 g at 
baseline  to  51.3  g  at  12  months,  mean  difference  =   − 5.09  g, 
95% CI =  − 6.5 to  − 3.7,  P <.0001) but was reduced to a statisti-
cally  signiﬁ cantly  greater  extent  in  the  dietary  intervention 
group (from 57.3 g at baseline to 33.3 g at 12 months, mean 
difference  =   − 24.4  g,  95%  CI  =   − 26.1  to   − 22.6,   P <.0001; 
 P <.001 comparing the mean difference between groups). The 
difference in fat gram intake was maintained through 5 years 
(difference in fat grams per day in dietary versus control groups 
of  − 18.0 g [95% CI =  − 19.9 to  − 16.1] at 12 months and  − 19.0 g 
[95% CI =  − 22.1 to  − 16.0] at 60 months [both  P <.0001]). Sim-
ilar differences were seen for all fat categories and in percent-
age  of  calories  from  fat  ( Table  3 ).  In  addition,  energy  intake 
was somewhat lower and ﬁ ber intake slightly higher in inter-
vention  group  participants  ( Table  3 ).  Nutrient  adequacy  was 
maintained  in  both  groups,  with  the  exception  of  calcium, 
 vitamin  D,  and  vitamin  E,  for  which  intakes  were  somewhat 
below recommended levels at baseline and throughout the trial 
in both groups, a situation that was addressed with counseling 

 After  a  median  of  60  months,  277  relapse-free  survival 
events  and  389  disease-free  survival  events  were  reported 
( Table 4 ). Recurrence events were conﬁ rmed by central review 
in  99.5%  of  cases.  For  relapse-free  survival — the  primary 
 endpoint — the hazard ratio of an event in the dietary interven-
tion compared with the control group was 0.76 (95% CI = 0.60 
to 0.98) ( Fig. 2 ,  P  = .077 for stratiﬁ ed log rank and  P  = .034 for 
adjusted  Cox  model  analysis).  For  recurrence-free  survival 
(i.e., excluding contralateral breast cancers), the HR was 0.71 
(95% CI = 0.53 to 0.94; stratiﬁ ed log rank  P  = .050). For dis-
ease-free survival, the HR was 0.81 (95% CI = 0.65 to 0.99; 
stratiﬁ ed log rank  P  = .078). There was no difference in overall 
survival comparing women receiving the dietary intervention 
with control group women (HR = 0.89; 95% CI = 0.65 to 1.21; 
stratiﬁ ed log rank  P  = .56). Based on the effects on the pri -
mary endpoint, 38 women would need to adopt a lifestyle inter-
vention  reducing  dietary  fat  intake  to  prevent  one  additional 
breast cancer recurrence.             

 Dietary  intervention  effects  were  examined  based  on  BMI, 
hormone  receptor,  and  nodal  status  in  subgroup  analyses  by 
using  adjusted  Cox  model. A  total  of  eight  subgroup  analyses 
were performed, and none of the interactions tested were statisti-
cally signiﬁ cant. However, the dietary intervention had a greater 
effect  on  relapse-free  survival  in  women  with  ER-negative

  *  Relapse-free survival events include local, regional, and distant recurrence, 

ipsilateral breast recurrence after lumpectomy, and contralateral breast cancer.  

   †   Disease-free survival events include those for relapse-free survival and also 
include any secondary invasive cancer, excluding basal and squamous skin can-
cer, and death without breast cancer recurrence.  

  D ISCUSSION  

 WINS is, to our knowledge, the ﬁ rst large-scale randomized 
trial to test whether a dietary intervention can improve the clinical 
outcome of women with breast cancer. The WINS results indi-
cate that a lifestyle intervention designed to reduce dietary fat 
intake  can  be  successfully  implemented  in  women  with  early-
stage, resected breast cancer receiving conventional cancer man-
agement in a multicenter clinical trial setting. After approximately 
5 years of follow-up, women in the dietary intervention group 
had a 24% lower risk of relapse than those in the control group 
(HR  =  0.76;  95%  CI  =  0.60  to  0.98).  Although  these  results 
are suggestive of beneﬁ t for the dietary intervention, given the 
level of statistical signiﬁ cance ( P  = .034 for adjusted Cox model 
 analysis),  the  higher  relapse-free  survival  seen  in  the  dietary 
group could also be a result of chance.

   Fig. 3.     Kaplan – Meier estimates of relapse-free survival. ( A ) Estrogen receptor –
 positive  subjects.  ( B )  Estrogen  receptor – negative  subjects.  Number  of  events/
number of patients in the dietary intervention and control groups are indicated. 
Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% conﬁ dence intervals (CIs) were calculated from 
adjusted  Cox  proportional  hazard  model  comparisons  of  control  to  dietary 
intervention groups through the 60-month median follow-up period.  P  values are

 Secondary analyses suggested a stronger effect for dietary fat 
reduction on breast cancer recurrence in women with hormone 
receptor – negative cancers compared with women whose cancers 
were  hormone  receptor  positive;  however,  the  interaction  be-
tween dietary intervention and hormone receptor status was not 
statistically signiﬁ cant. These ﬁ ndings are consistent with trends 
suggestive of a differential dietary inﬂ uence by hormone receptor 
status  on  breast  cancer  incidence  recently  described  in  the 
Women’s Health Initiative randomized primary prevention trial 
and in a Nurse’s Health Study cohort  ( 31 , 32 ) . A differential inﬂ u-
ence of dietary fat on breast cancer recurrence based on hormone 
 receptor  status  will  require  conﬁ rmation.  However,  some  of 
the most active adjuvant breast cancer interventions, including 
aromatase  inhibitors   ( 21  –  24 )   and  trastuzumab   ( 33  –  35 ) ,  are 
effective only in biologically deﬁ ned subgroups, and interactions 
have been observed between ER status and adjuvant chemother-
apy effect  ( 36 ) . Thus, it would not be surprising to ﬁ nd that a 
lifestyle  intervention  has  an  effect  on  only  some  categories  of 
breast cancer. 

 Because ER-positive cancers are under estrogen inﬂ uence, a 
predominant inﬂ uence of diet on ER-negative cancers would im-
plicate factors other than estrogen  ( 37 , 38 )  as mediators. Other 
potential  mechanisms  include  reduced  insulin  levels   ( 39 , 40 ) , 
reduced  insulin  resistance   ( 41 ) ,  reduced  insulin-like  growth

factor 1  ( 42 , 43 ) , or reduced inﬂ ammation markers — all factors 
that may be inﬂ uenced by dietary fat decrease and/or weight loss 
 ( 44 , 45 ) . Planned analyses of serial fasting blood samples in the 
two groups will address these issues. 

 The most appropriate endpoint for breast cancer adjuvant tri-
als is controversial, and even the deﬁ nitions of these endpoints 
are  inconsistent   ( 46 ) .  Endpoints  from  recent  selected  adjuvant 
therapy trials are compared to the relapse-free survival endpoint 
of the WINS trial in  Table 6 . Collectively, these reports deﬁ ne 
the  endpoint  of   “ disease-free  survival ”   in  four  different  ways 
 ( 21  –  24 , 27 ) . We deﬁ ned relapse-free survival, the prospectively 
identiﬁ ed primary study endpoint in WINS, in the same way that 
Goss et al.  ( 22 )  recently deﬁ ned a disease-free survival endpoint. 

To facilitate comparison of our study with others, we included 
death without breast cancer recurrence and second primary can-
cers  as  events  in  additional  analyses;  all  results  led  to  similar 
conclusions  regarding  the  effects  of  the  dietary  intervention. 
Establishment of a common terminology for breast cancer adju-
vant trial endpoints should be a future priority of the research 
community.     

 This study has several potential limitations. One is the imbal-
ance  of  surgical  treatments  between  the  groups:  5.6%  more 
women in the control group than in the intervention group had 
breast-conserving  therapy. As  a  result,  55  more  women  in  the 
control group with  such surgery were at risk for an ipsilateral 
recurrence. However, considering all 1018 control group women 
with breast-conserving surgery, only 2.1% experienced ipsilat-
eral  recurrence.  Consequently,  only  about  one  additional  in-
breast  recurrence  would  be  anticipated  based  on  the  surgical 
distribution. Thus, the modest imbalance in surgical management 
is unlikely to explain the difference in clinical outcome that we 
observed.  In  addition,  in  a  large  National  Surgical  Adjuvant 
Breast  and  Bowel  Project  Cancer  randomized  trial  comparing 
mastectomy with lumpectomy plus radiation, women with mas-
tectomy had a similar rate of local and regional recurrences after 
approximately 5 years of follow-up, even when ipsilateral breast 
recurrences were included (45 such recurrences were seen in the 
mastectomy  group  compared  with  43  in  the  lumpectomy  plus 
 radiation group)  ( 47 ) . Moreover, our adjustment for surgery type 
(mastectomy versus lumpectomy) in the Cox proportional haz-
ards models should have controlled for the effect of the differ-
ences in surgical management. 

 A  second  limitation  of  the  study  is  its  reliance  on  self-
report of dietary intake because no validated  “ gold standard ”  
exists  for  assessing  dietary  fat  intake   ( 48 ) .  However,  body 
weight  was  statistically  signiﬁ cantly  lower  in  the  dietary 
group,  providing  biologic  plausibility  that  a  dietary  change 
did occur in women on the low-fat eating plan. Although the 
dietary intervention focused on reducing fat intake, intake of 
other nutrients changed, as did body weight. Thus, it is possi-
ble  that  weight  change   ( 49 , 50 )   and/or  dietary  factors  other 
than fat intake inﬂ uenced the breast cancer outcome. Planned 
future analyses will examine time trends and associations of 
changes in body weight and other dietary factors with breast 
cancer recurrence. 

 Study strengths include the randomized study design, closely 
comparable  anticancer  systemic  therapies  provided  to  women 
in  the  two  randomization  groups,  and  the  degree  of  dietary 
 adherence  achieved  by  study  participants.  The  reduction  in

 dietary fat intake seen in the WINS trial is similar to or greater 
than  that  reported  in  other  trials  evaluating  breast  cancer  and 
diet associations either for primary prevention  ( 31 , 51 )  or recur-
rence  ( 52 ) . 

 Replication in clinical practice of this dietary intervention will 
likely  require  on-going  counseling  with  a  dietician  trained  in 
these techniques. The WINS low-fat eating plan was intensive, 
individualized, and delivered using a standardized protocol by 
registered dieticians who had received centralized training which 
included motivational interviewing techniques. 

 In summary, an interim efﬁ cacy analysis suggests that a life-
style intervention reducing dietary fat intake with modest body 
weight loss may improve the relapse-free survival of postmeno-
pausal  breast  cancer  patients.  Ongoing  follow-up  will  address 
original protocol design plans calling for 3 years of follow-up 
after completion of recruitment.

Risk of Breast Cancer

Abstract

Dietary energy restriction (DER) reduces risk of spontaneous mammary cancer in rodents.
In humans, DER in premenopausal years seems to reduce risk of postmenopausal breast
cancer. Markers of DER are required to develop acceptable DER regimens for breast cancer
prevention. We therefore examined markers of DER in the breast, adipose tissue, and serum.
Nineteen overweight or obese women at moderately increased risk of breast cancer (life-
time risk, 1 in 6 to 1 in 3) ages between 35 and 45 were randomly allocated to DER [liquid
diet, 3,656 kJ/d (864 kcal/d); n = 10] or asked to continue their normal eating patterns (n = 9)
for one menstrual cycle. Biopsies of the breast and abdominal fat were taken before and
after the intervention. RNA was extracted from whole tissues and breast epithelium (by laser
capture microdissection) and hybridized to Affymetrix GeneChips. Longitudinal plasma and
urine samples were collected before and after intervention, and metabolic profiles were gen-
erated using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.

DER was associated with significant reductions in weight [−7.0 (±2.3) kg] and in alterations
of serum biomarkers of breast cancer risk (insulin, leptin, total and low-density lipoprotein
cholesterol, and triglycerides). In both abdominal and breast tissues, as well as isolated
breast epithelial cells, genes involved in glycolytic and lipid synthesis pathways (including
stearoyl-CoA desaturase, fatty acid desaturase, and aldolase C) were significantly down-
regulated.

We conclude that reduced expressions of genes in the lipid metabolism and glycolytic
pathways are detectable in breast tissue following DER, and these may represent targets
for DER mimetics as effective chemoprophylactic agents.

Dietary energy restriction (DER) significantly reduces sponta-
neous mammary tumors in laboratory rodents irrespective of
the type of macronutrient restricted (1). Observational studies
indicate that weight loss in premenopausal or postmenopaus-
al women reduces the risk of postmenopausal breast cancer (2,
3). For example, in the Iowa Women's Health Study, women
who lost >5% of their body weight before menopause had
40% fewer breast cancers in the postmenopausal period com-
pared with women who continued to gain weight (2). Post-
menopausal weight loss of >10 kg reduced postmenopausal

breast cancer by 60% in the Nurses' Health Study, and >5%
postmenopausal weight loss in the Iowa Women's Health
Study was associated with a 25% reduction in risk (2, 3). Re-
duction in cancer risk is also seen after weight reduction after
bariatric surgery (4–7). DER is associated with diverse cellular
changes, including alteration of growth factor, signaling and
metabolic pathways, and reduction of cell proliferation (8,
9), in animal studies. DER favorably alters serum markers of
breast cancer risk, such as insulin, leptin, sex hormone binding
globulin (SHBG), and lipids, in women who are overweight or

obese (10–13). A recent study reported changes in the urinary
and serum metabolome of long-term dietary-restricted dogs
(14). Several groups have assessed the effects of energy restric-
tion (1–3) and changes in macronutrient profiles (1, 3) on gene
expression in s.c. abdominal adipose tissue. These studies
were undertaken in obese men and women and were relative-
ly short-term studies with periods of energy restriction of be-
tween 2 and 28 days (2) or of 5 (1) and 10 weeks (3). However,
there has been, to our knowledge, no assessment of breast
gene expression in response to DER (15–18). Of the many gene
changes induced by DER, down-regulation of genes associat-
ed with fatty acid synthesis and desaturation is the most
prominent.

In the study reported here, we sought to assess whether ef-
fects of DER are apparent in breast tissue of overweight and
obese women at increased risk of breast cancer to begin to un-
derstand a possible molecular mechanism for DER in breast
cancer prevention.

Materials and Methods

Subject selection
Nineteen premenopausal overweight or obese [body mass index
(BMI) between 28 and 40 kg/m2] parous women ages between 35
and 45 y at increased risk of breast cancer (estimated lifetime risk, 1
in 6 to 1 in 3; ref. 19) were recruited from our Family History Clinic
and randomized to DER or to continue normal diet (Fig. 1). Other en-
try criteria included a normal mammogram within 24 mo, stable or
increasing weight, and sedentary lifestyle (not participating in >40
min of moderate activity per week). Exclusion criteria included al-
ready losing weight following restrictive diets; taking dietary supple-
ments; recent use of tamoxifen; regular use of anti-inflammatory,
anticoagulant, antiplatelet, or oral contraceptive medication; pregnant
or planning a pregnancy; previous hysterectomy; and serious comor-
bid conditions such as a previous diagnosis of cancer, diabetes, ische-
mic vascular disease, thyroid disease, or psychiatric disorders.
Seventy-eight volunteers were eligible but 59 decided not to partici-
pate, mainly after disliking a 2-d test diet or on learning the invasive-
ness of the protocol. Although the 59 nonparticipating women were
eligible in terms of weight and other criteria, it is unknown how they
compared with participating women for the other characteristics mea-
sured in Table 1. The study was reviewed by the Bolton (Lancashire)
Local Research Ethics Committee (Number 05/Q1409/42). All partici-
pants provided written informed consent before participation.

Study protocol
Breast and s.c. abdominal biopsies and fasting blood and urine
were collected in the follicular phase shortly after the beginning of
menses for two subsequent menstrual cycles to avoid widely fluctuat-
ing hormone levels producing confounding alterations in gene expres-
sion (20). Weight and total body fat (bioelectrical impedence, Tanita
TBF300a), waist, hip, and bust measurements were also measured
on this occasion. Three measurements of waist, hip, and bust size
were made using standardized methods to the nearest 1.00 mm,
and the mean of these measurements was used. Waist was measured
at the level of the umbilicus and hip at the widest point over the
tronchanters. Dietary intake and physical activity for 7 d before each
assessment were assessed from a 7-d diet history and physical activity
recall (21, 22). Energy and macronutrient intake of reported diets were
assessed using the five-diet analysis program (Compeat). After the
first biopsies, participants were randomized to either DER (n = 10)
or a control group (n = 9) who were advised to maintain their usual
eating and exercise pattern. DER consisted of four 325 mL cans of a
commercially available nutritionally complete milk shake (“Slimfast,”
Unilever) and 2 to 3 L of other clear low-energy, high-potassium fluids

Tissue Biomarkers of Energy Restriction

(water, black tea, coffee, low-calorie soft drinks, or stock-based
drinks). Overall, the diet provided on average 3,614 kJ/d (864 kcal/
d); 26% (58 g) of energy was from protein, 62% (97 g) from carbohy-
drate, 12% (26 g) from fat, and 7% (6.4 g) from saturated fat (Fig. 1).
Participants randomized to DER were monitored weekly by the study
dieticians to encourage good compliance, whereas those on their usual
diet were monitored after 2 wk to check that weight was being main-
tained.

Biopsy procedures
Breast. Recent craniocaudal and mediolateral oblique mammo-
grams of each participant were reviewed to assess the pattern of
breast tissue. Biopsies in women with a dense glandular breast pattern
were done under radiographic guidance (n = 7). A single-coned cra-
niocaudal mammogram of the breast was obtained at the time of bi-
opsy and done with the breast immobilized under the compression
device. In women with a diffusely fatty breast pattern (n = 12), biop-
sies were done without radiological guidance. After infiltration of 2%
lidocaine, a small incision was made in the skin at the biopsy site
through which a 14-gauge biopsy needle was inserted to a depth es-
timated by the operator. Between seven and nine biopsy samples were
obtained through the same skin incision, although the direction of the
needle was altered for each sample.

Abdominal fat. Three to five milliliters of s.c. abdominal adipose
tissue were obtained by suction biopsy under local anesthesia from
the anterior abdominal wall, midway between the anterior superior
iliac spine and the umbilicus. The first biopsies were taken from either
the left or right breast/abdominal side chosen by computer random-
ization (independently) and repeat biopsies on the opposite side to
eliminate gene expression changes due to the healing process. One
half of two separate breast cores were fixed in 4% formalin and em-
bedded in paraffin blocks; the remaining tissue was immediately snap
frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C.

Blood measures
Hormone, glucose, and lipid assays, which may be influenced by
DER, were undertaken at the Clinical Biochemistry Department of
South Manchester University Hospital Foundation Trust: glucose

agnostics), insulin [electrochemiluminescence immunoassay, Elecsys;
Roche Diagnostics; interassay coefficient of variation (CV), 10.6%], tes-
tosterone (chemiluminescence; Chiron Diagnostics; CV, 6.5%), and
SHBG (noncompetitive IRMA; IRMA-Orion Diagnostica; CV, 8.4%).
Fasting insulin and glucose were combined to calculate the insulin
sensitivity index using the homeostasis model assessment (23). Total
serum insulin-like growth factor-I (enzyme-labeled chemiluminescent
immunometric assay; Diagnostic Products Corp.; CV, 11.3%), serum
testosterone (chemiluminescence), and estradiol (electrochemilumi-
nescence immunoassay) were also measured. Colorimetric enzyme re-
actions were used to measure total cholesterol (CV, 3%), triglyceride
(CV, 5.4%; Bayer Diagnostics), and high-density lipoprotein cholester-
ol (CV, 7.1%; Randox); the levels were measured spectrophotometri-
cally by an automated Olympus AU600 analyzer. The adipokines
leptin and adiponectin and markers of inflammation high-sensitivity
C-reactive protein and sialic acid were determined at MRC Human
Nutrition Research Laboratory (Cambridge, United Kingdom). Plas-
ma leptin concentration was measured using an ELISA method
(Quantikine Human Leptin kit, R&D Systems; CV, 10%), whereas
plasma adiponectin was measured using RIA (LINCO Research,
Inc.; CV, 10%). Sialic acid was assayed using a colorimetric assay
(Roche Diagnostics; CV, 1.2%) adapted for use on the Hitachi 912 Clin-
ical Analyzer (Roche Diagnostics) and C-reactive protein using a high-
sensitivity, particle-enhanced turbidometric assay (CV, 4.5%; Dade
Behring). Serum and plasma samples were aliquoted, stored at −70°
C, and batched so that all samples from a participant were included
in the same assay (24). Laboratory personnel were blinded to the sam-
ple identity. Baseline age, BMI, and body fat and changes in weight,

adiposity, diet and exercise parameters, and hormone and lipid levels
were compared between groups using the Mann-Whitney test using
Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 14 (SPSS, Inc.).

Metabolomics
Serum (in 200 μL aliquots) samples were added to an internal stan-
dard solution (0.174 mg.mL−1 succinic d4 acid, 0.172 mg.mL−1 glycine
d5, and 0.182 mg.mL−1 malonic d2 acid in water) and combined with
600 μL methanol, vortexed for 15 s, and centrifuged (15 min, 13,000 ×
g), and the supernatant was lyophilized (HETO VR MAXI vacuum
centrifuge attached to a HETO CT/DW 60E cooling trap; Thermo Life
Sciences). Urine samples were treated as for the serum, except 100 μL
urease solution (10 mg.mL−1) was added to 75 μL aliquots incubated
at 37°C for 30 min to enzymatically degrade urea and then combined
with 250 μL methanol. Lyophilized samples were chemically deriva-
tized in two stages. 50 μL of 20 mg/mL O-methylhydroxylamine so-
lution in pyridine were added and heated at 40°C for 90 min followed
by addition of 50 μL of N-acetyl-N-(trimethylsilyl)-trifluoroacetamide
and heating at 40°C for 90 min. A retention index solution was added
for chromatographic alignment (20 μL, 0.6 mg/mL C10/C12/C15/
C19/C22 n-alkanes in pyridine). Samples were subsequently analyzed
in a random order using gas chromatography-time of flight-mass
spectrometry (Agilent 6890 GC coupled to a LECO Pegasus III ToF
mass spectrometer) as described previously using optimized settings
for serum (25). Raw data were processed using LECO ChromaTof
v2.12 and its associated chromatographic deconvolution algorithm,
with the baseline set at 1.0, data point averaging of 3, and average
peak width of 2.5. A reference database was prepared, incorporating
the mass spectrum and retention index of all metabolite peaks de-
tected in a random selection of samples so to allow detection of all
metabolites present, whether expected or not expected from the study
of metabolic pathways. Each metabolite peak in the reference data-
base was searched for in each sample, and if matched (retention index
deviation, <±10; mass spectral match, >700), the peak area was re-
ported and the response ratio relative to the internal standard (peak
area-metabolite/peak area-succinic d4 acid internal standard) was cal-
culated. These data (matrix of N samples × P metabolite peaks) repre-
senting normalized peak lists were exported in ASCII format. The

serum and urine data (analyzed separately) were split into DER
and control groups for analysis with a two-sided paired Wilcoxon
signed rank test for each metabolite using the null hypothesis that
the difference (DER versus normal eating habits) in metabolite level
comes from a continuous, symmetrical distribution with a median
value of zero (26). Each significant (P < 0.05) metabolite was com-
pared with its receiver operating characteristic for differentiating
DER from controls.

RNA extraction
RNA was extracted from breast tissue using a protocol devised
by M. Dowsett and A. Kendall (27). Briefly, 20 to 50 mg of breast
tissue were ground to a fine powder under liquid nitrogen; RNA
was isolated with 600 μL of Qiazol reagent (Qiagen Ltd.), which
was passed through a commercially available RNA shearing de-
vice (QiaShredder, Qiagen); and 200 μL chloroform was added, in-
cubated at room temperature for 5 min, and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm
for 15 min. The aqueous phase was removed to a clean tube and
350 μL of 70% ethanol were added. The mixture was placed in an
RNeasy Micro column (Qiagen) and the protocol for the RNeasy Mi-
cro kit was followed to completion. Abdominal adipose tissue total
RNA was isolated using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the
method described by Chomczynski and Sacchi (28). RNA samples
were purified using RNeasy Mini columns (Qiagen) according to
the manufacturer's protocols. RNA concentration and quality was
assessed using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Tech-
nologies) and Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies).
All whole tissue samples yielded RNA in sufficient quantity and
quality for microarray analysis. Total RNA (2 μg) from abdominal
tissue was processed according to the standard Affymetrix protocol
for one-cycle target labeling to produce labeled cRNA. Total RNA
(10 ng) isolated from the breast tissue core biopsies was amplified
using a poly(A) PCR exponential amplification method based on
the techniques described by Brady et al. (29) and Iscove et al.
(30), which allow very small starting amounts of total RNA to be
used. Samples were then hybridized to HGU133 Plus2 GeneChips
(Affymetrix).

Laser capture microdissection
Before laser capture, frozen sections were fixed and areas of interest
were stained using the Arcturus Histogene frozen section staining kit
(KIT0401), as per manufacturer's instructions. The laser capture micro-
dissection was done on the Arcturus XT System. Microdissection was
done by laser pulses activating a thermoplastic polymer film attached
to an inverted CapSure “cap,” which then expands and surrounds the
cells of interest, allowing removal. Following cell capture, RNA was
extracted and isolated using the Arcturus PicoPure RNA isolation kit
(KIT0202) as per manufacturer's instructions. RNA was amplified us-
ing the Nugen WT-Ovation Pico System RNA amplification kit (Nu-
gen), labeled, and hybridized to Affymetrix U133 Plus2 GeneChips as
described in full on our Web site.6

Microarray analysis
After scanning, array images were assessed by eye to confirm scan-
ner alignment and the absence of significant bubbles or scratches on
the chip surface. Ratios (3′/5′) for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehy-
drogenase and β-actin were confirmed to be within acceptable limits
(0.86-1.38 and 0.70-1.24, respectively), and BioB spike controls were
found to be present on all chips, with BioC, BioD, and CreX also pres-

ent in increasing intensity. All microarray data are MIAME compliant
and accessible via MIAME VICE.7 Gene expression data were ana-
lyzed using packages within Bioconductor8 (31) implemented in the
R statistical programming language. The gene expression data were
normalized using the GeneChip Robust Multi-array Average algo-
rithm (32) within the “simpleaffy” package (33) and then compared
using multiclass significance analysis of microarrays (SAM; ref. 34) us-
ing the siggenes package. Baseline and repeat biopsies were paired
and analyzed in the DER group and control group separately. The
gene ontologies of significantly differentially expressed genes were ex-
amined using the GoMiner9 software (35).

Results

Ten women were randomized to DER, and 9 to their normal
diet (median ages, 42.4 and 41.8 years, respectively), and medi-
an study periods were 26.2 and 26.9 days for the DER and con-
trol groups (Fig. 1). No woman withdrew from the study at any
point. The biopsies were tolerated well, with no adverse side
effects other than bruising at both the breast and abdominal

sites. The energy-restricted diet was well tolerated. The com-
monest side effects were constipation of variable degree (n =
6), eased in all cases by increasing intake of clear fluids, and
halitosis (n = 5), which resolved by improving oral hygiene
and was likely due to the thick texture and sugar content of
the drink. There were no significant differences at baseline
between the DER and control groups with respect to weight,
BMI, body fat, calorie intake, dietary macronutrient compo-
sition, serum hormones, glucose, or inflammatory markers
(Tables 1 and 2).

Change in anthropometry, hormones, and lipids
Compliance to the dietary regimens seemed to be good be-
cause all 10 women in the DER group lost weight (median loss
of −7.0, ±2.3); in contrast, women in the control group showed
minor fluctuations in weight with a median gain of 0.3 (±1.5).
Fat mass, fat free mass, waist, hip, and bust measurements de-
creased significantly in all of the women in the DER group;
there was no change in these parameters in the control group
(Table 1). As expected, the level of total and low-density lipo-
proteins, cholesterol, triglyceride, and leptin fell significantly
and SHBG rose significantly in the DER group (Table 1).
Women in both groups were sedentary and remained so
throughout the study (Table 2).

Metabolomics
Of the 253 derivatized metabolite peaks detected, 83 could
be definitively identified by matching the retention index
(±10) and mass spectral match (>700) of metabolite in sample
to an authentic metabolite standard analyzed on the same an-
alytic system. In addition, 49 were identified on a preliminary
basis by matching (match >700) of mass spectrum only to me-
tabolites present in available mass spectral libraries (NIST/
EPA/NIH02 library and the publicly available MPI-Golm li-
brary).10 The metabolites that were significantly changed in
plasma and urine for DER participants compared with con-
trols are illustrated in Fig. 2 and were consistent with known
effects of calorie restriction. A significant increase in glycolic
acid in urine correlates with the reduction in glycolytic genes
and increased lipid oxidation (Fig. 3). Increased urea and re-
duction in available amino acids, serine, and glycine in blood
is concordant with the breakdown of proteins due to calorie
restriction. There was also an increase in adipic acid and 3-
hydroxybutanoic acid in urine following DER, suggesting in-
creased lipid oxidation and the formation of ketone bodies.
Observations of participants, however, suggested they were
not ketotic, and the odor of ketones was not detectable on
their breath. The low-energy diet chosen in this study was
not expected to be ketogenic, containing 138 g/d of carbohy-
drates, which is far in excess of the minimum dietary intake of
50 g/d required to prevent ketosis (36).

Gene expression analyses
Microarrays were done on all breast and abdominal fat sam-
ples at time zero and after 1 month. In the control group, no
probe sets were found to be consistently differentially ex-
pressed between baseline and repeat biopsies in either breast
or abdominal adipose tissue using SAM software. Seventy-

two probe sets (representing 61 genes) were differentially ex-
pressed between baseline and repeat biopsies in the breast tis-
sue in the DER group [with a false discovery rate (FDR) of
0.38], whereas 200 probe sets (representing 161 genes) were
differentially expressed between baseline and repeat biopsies
in the abdominal adipose tissue in response to DER (with a
FDR of 0.01; full lists in Supplementary Tables S1 and S2).
Choosing a lower FDR for the breast tissue resulted in no
consistently significant genes being identified (due to greater
tissue heterogeneity); conversely, a higher FDR for the ab-
dominal tissue resulted in almost a quarter of the genes pres-
ent on the array to be called significant. To ensure that the
amplification step used for the breast tissue did not affect
our findings, we also amplified RNA from the abdominal ad-
ipose tissue from three participants before and after DER and
hybridized the samples to Affymetrix GeneChips; >90% of
the top 200 probe sets identified using SAM analysis re-
mained the same.

Many more genes were down-regulated than up-regulated
with DER (56 of 61 in the breast and 113 of 161 in adipose tis-
sue). Of the 61 genes significantly altered in the breast (Sup-
plementary Table S1), 11 were also significantly altered in
adipose tissue; several of these were represented by more than
one probe set, showing reproducibility, although P values
were lower for the abdominal tissue (Table 3). The most
down-regulated genes in the breast [stearoyl-CoA desaturase
(SCD), fatty acid desaturase 1 (FADS1), transferrin, and aldolase
C (ALDOC)] were among those shared with adipose tissue.
Other genes down-regulated in the breast were osteonidogen,
transmembrane protein 135, mitochondrial carrier triple repeat 1,
and hexokinase 2; the most down-regulated genes unique to ad-
ipose tissue were ELOVL family member 6 elongation of fatty
acids, secreted frizzled related protein2, cholesteryl ester transfer
protein, and plasma and collagen type II α1 (Table 3).

Gene ontology and pathway analysis
Genes differentially expressed in both breast and abdominal
tissue following DER were most frequently related to metab-
olism and energy pathways, with approximately one third of
gene ontology terms common to both tissues (Supplementary
Tables S3 and S4). Looking at genes within the highlighted
pathways using GenMAPP,11 it was clearly seen that almost
all the individual genes involved in the glycolysis, tricarbox-
ylic acid cycle, electron transport chain, and fatty acid metab-
olism were down-regulated in both adipose and breast tissue
following DER. Many of these genes were significantly differ-
entially expressed (P < 0.05). Several gluconeogenesis genes
were up-regulated and genes within the fatty acid β-oxidation
pathway were both up-regulated and down-regulated (sum-
marized in Fig. 3).

Expression of epithelial genes in the breast tissue
Epithelial-specific genes (keratin 14, keratin 18, CD24, and
SC38GB202) were expressed at high levels in all 38 breast sam-
ples but were low or not expressed in abdominal adipose tis-
sue (Fig. 4), suggesting that some epithelium was present in all
breast tissue hybridized to GeneChips. The expression of eight
epithelial genes was also assessed by quantitative reverse

transcription-PCR in the four quadrants of each breast from
four women undergoing bilateral risk reduction mastectomy.
Although there was some variation between sides, the differ-
ences between individuals were significantly greater, suggest-
ing relatively lower heterogeneity between contralateral
breasts in individuals (Supplementary Table S5).

Laser capture microdissection was then used to isolate
breast epithelial cells from fixed frozen tissue, and sufficient
RNA for GeneChip analysis was obtained from three matched
samples before and after DER. The majority of expression
changes for the highlighted DER genes were consistent be-
tween the microdissected epithelium and whole breast tissue
for this limited number of samples. Using the MAS5 normal-
ization method (37) to estimate whether particular probe sets
are expressed (called “present,” rather than absent), we deter-
mined that 93% (67 of 72) of the DER breast probe sets were
called present using MAS5 normalization in at least three of
the six microdissected samples. Just 2 of the 72 DER breast
probe sets representing ABCC6 and LOC389393 were not
called present in any of the epithelial-only samples (Supple-
mentary Table S1). Using the same method, we also confirmed
expression of >80% of the 72 DER breast genes in the ducts
and lobules of at least half of the normal breast tissue sam-
ples isolated by laser capture microdissection in a study pub-
lished by Turashvili et al. (Supplementary Table S1; ref. 38),
suggesting that DER-regulated genes are expressed in breast
epithelium.

Discussion

Because studies in rodents and observational studies in
women indicate that DER reduces the risk of mammary can-

cer, we designed the study reported here to determine poten-
tial biomarkers of the effect and effectiveness of DER in
women at increased risk of breast cancer (1–5). DER (∼60%
normal diet) was sufficient to favorably change known se-
rum/urine biomarkers of breast cancer risk (insulin, leptin,
and SHBG). Gene expression in breast tissue was also altered
following DER, with some changes consistent with those in
the adipose tissue. The metabolomic results seem to corrobo-
rate the changes in metabolic pathways seen at the gene ex-
pression level.

The tissue composition of the breast is variable and
changes with age and during pregnancy. In parous women
ages 35 to 45 years, it is estimated that the breast comprises
10% to 20% epithelium, with 60% to 80% fibroconnective
tissue and 10% to 20% adipose tissue (39, 40). The propor-
tion of adipose tissue is likely to be higher in overweight
and obese women, such as those who were eligible for this
study. It is not clear from our study whether the changes in
gene expression common to the breast and abdominal tissue
following DER affect the breast adipose tissue or breast ep-
ithelium directly. However, our limited laser capture micro-
dissection study of pure epithelium and analysis of the
RNA suggested a direct effect of DER on epithelial gene ex-
pression. A study of biopsies of normal breast tissue before
and after letrozole showed multiple gene changes, but these
investigators were also unable to distinguish between stro-
mal and epithelial changes because of paucity of the latter
(27). Further studies are required to establish tissue-specific
gene expression changes within the breast.

The four most down-regulated genes in the breast were also
down-regulated in abdominal adipose tissue, and three of the
genes were related to the metabolic pathways of fat synthesis

(SCD and FADS) and glycolysis (ALDOC). SCD has been
shown to be a highly down-regulated gene in s.c. adipose tis-
sue in several DER studies (15, 16, 18). SCD is the gatekeeper
to the formation of unsaturated fatty acids because it intro-
duces a double bond in the 9 position in the saturated fatty

acids stearate and palmitate to form monounsaturated fatty
acids oleic and palmitooleic acids. SCD-deficient mice are lean
and have reduced lipid synthesis and enhanced lipid oxida-
tion and insulin sensitivity (41). SCD knockdown reduces pro-
liferation and Akt phosphorylation in cancer cell lines (42, 43).

Fig. 3. Simplified representation of the glycolytic
and fatty acid synthesis pathways following DER.
Glycolysis, the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, electron
transport chain, and fatty acid synthesis were all
down-regulated (long dashes) and gluconeogenesis
was up-regulated (short dashes). Genes involved
with fatty acid β-oxidation were both up-regulated
and down-regulated. Italics, enzymes that were
down-regulated by SAM analysis in our study.
Superscript numbers represent the tissue in which
down-regulation occurred: 1, breast tissue; 2,
adipose tissue; 3, both.

Inhibition of SCD by stearic acid reduces N-nitrosomethylurea–
induced mammary tumor development in rats. A high unsat-
urated to saturated fat ratio in red cell membranes or serum
phospholipids (indicating low SCD activity) is associated with
reduced risk of breast cancer (44, 45). Thus, low SCD activity
in the breast may not only be a marker of the effectiveness of

DER but also an indicator of reduced risk of breast cancer and
a target for energy restriction mimetic agents (46).

We studied the effects of DER on a relatively homogenous
group of women who were all of similar weight and age
and were all parous. All biopsies, serum, and urine samples
were taken at about the same day of each menstrual cycle

under standardized, fasting conditions to limit variance. The
inclusion of a control group allowed us to assess any
changes in gene expression, which may be influenced by
the site or timing of biopsies. The lack of changes in gene
expression in the control group gives confidence that the
changes observed following DER are “real” and indicates
the stability of gene expression when diet and exercise are
unchanged. To maximize compliance and standardize die-
tary change, the DER comprised a liquid meal replacement
drink (Slimfast). The declines in body fat (−4.6 kg over 26
days) among the DER group are consistent with ∼1,400
kcal/d energy deficit, indicating good compliance to the
DER regimen (47). The clear effect of DER on body weight,
fat, and lipids and leptin confirms that compliance was at a
sufficient level to have metabolic effects and reflects the suc-
cess of our rigorous selection process. DER is well known to
cause declines in leptin (15) and SHBG (48). The decline in
total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycer-
ides is consistent with previous studies of low-fat, energy-
restricted regimens (49, 50).

The DER regimen used in our study reduced energy in-
take (67%) but also resulted in differential reduction of
macronutrients from the woman's standard diet of calories
from carbohydrate (53% reduced), protein (43% reduced),

and fat (89% reduced). It is possible that some of the changes
seen in this study were due to altered composition of the
diet, specifically the greatly decreased fat intake. It is known
that an isocaloric dietary change of macronutrients, such as
the combined requirement of carbohydrate and saturated fat
for induction of SCD in humans (18), can alter urinary me-
tabolomic patterns and gene expression in s.c. fat. However,
several studies show that DER produces changes in gene
expression, which are greater than changes in diet macronu-
trient composition (15–18). We believe that further metabolo-
mic studies are warranted to assess relative importance
between fat and carbohydrate to energy restriction. Some ob-
servational studies show a modest reduction of breast cancer
risk after reduction of fat intake, but a large randomized trial
of isocaloric fat reduction was not associated with risk reduc-
tion (51, 52).

Opposite breasts were sampled 1 month apart to circum-
vent potential inflammatory changes if biopsies had been tak-
en from one breast only. This is a potential weakness of the
study given the known heterogeneity of the breast and may
account for some of the changes seen. However, no consistent
differences in gene expression were seen in the controls in the
biopsies taken from contralateral breasts 1 month apart, and

epithelial-specific genes from the four quadrants of each breast
from four women undergoing bilateral risk reduction mastec-
tomy suggested greater variation between individuals than
between breasts.

A higher FDR (0.3) was used to identify the most consistent-
ly changed genes in the breast tissue following DER compared
with the adipose tissue (0.01). We have postulated that is due
to greater heterogeneity of breast tissue compared with that of
the abdominal adipose. Alternatively, it could be an indication
that the response to DER in breast tissue is simply more var-
iable than the response in adipose tissue. Although the P va-
lues shown in Table 2 are not as low for the breast tissue as
they are for the adipose tissue, they are still highly significant.
Furthermore, gene ontology analysis identified many of the
same pathways for both tissues and almost all genes within
these were down-regulated (Supplementary Fig. S1). It would
be interesting to compare gene expression in breast adipo-
cytes, epithelium, and stroma separately; however, this ap-
proach would result in a much lower tissue to RNA yield
and therefore necessitate a more invasive biopsy technique.
However, we were able to do laser capture microdissection
of sufficient epithelium in three before and after DER samples
to obtain RNA and analyze gene expression. This revealed
similar changes in genes, such as SCD, to those seen in whole
tissue, suggesting that DER does affect breast epithelial gene
expression.

Previous studies have examined the effect of DER on s.c.
abdominal fat. Our findings are largely concordant with
those of other human studies. Notably, fatty acid synthesis
genes are down-regulated in the adipose tissue of both this
study (60% DER over 1 month) and the previous Affymetrix
array–based study of Dahlman et al. [30% DER over 10
weeks (15) and 50% DER over 5 weeks (18)], although this
article did not specify these specific metabolism genes. Other
studies have linked a 30% DER over 10 weeks with changes
in the expression of genes that encode transporters and tran-
scription factors linked to adipogenesis and mitochondrial
respiration (17). Clement et al. (53) reported that ∼60% of
genes differentially expressed in a 60% DER study over
1 month in s.c. adipose tissue were related to fat and carbo-
hydrate metabolism, although this group focused mainly on
inflammation-related genes. A recent study reported that ep-
ithelial cells from chemical-induced mammary adenocarcino-
mas from Sprague-Dawley rats had increased expression of
genes for glycolysis, decreased pyruvate dehydrogenase, and
increased lactate dehydrogenase compared with normal epi-
thelial cells, consistent with the Warburg effect (54). Howev-
er, this pattern of gene expression was not influenced by a
40% DER. The design of this study does not enable the ef-
fects of DER on spontaneous development of breast cancer
to be determined; furthermore, changes in lipid metabolism
were not reported (55). Adipocytes and breast epithelial cells
lie in close proximity to each other in breast tissue. Large
adipocytes in obese subjects may have dysregulated secre-
tion of factors (i.e., increased leptin and decreased adiponec-
tin), which may promote the proliferation of transformed
ductal carcinoma cells (56). DER resulted in significant re-
ductions in serum levels of leptin (66%) but no change in
serum adiponectin. Serum changes in leptin were not re-
flected in leptin gene expression. The dissociation between
adipokine gene expression and serum levels has been noted

Tissue Biomarkers of Energy Restriction

in earlier studies, suggesting a lack of sensitivity or post-
translational effects of DER (57). There have been few meta-
bolomic studies of DER in humans. We did not detect
significant changes in glycolysis (glucose-6-phosphate and
pyruvate) and tricarboxylic acid cycle metabolites (succinic
acid and 2-oxoglutaric acid) despite these pathways being
down-regulated at the gene expression level. However, the
small sample sizes would preclude the detection of small dif-
ferences in the concentrations of these metabolites.

The exact mechanism for the protective effect of DER
against cancer remains unknown. Increased glycolysis and
fatty acid synthesis is well described in tumors, and there
is renewed interest in inhibition of these pathways not only
for cancer treatment but also for prevention of cancer and
other diseases (see ref. 9 for review). For example, inhibition
of glycolysis with two deoxyglucose or fatty acid synthases
with a compound named C75 inhibits tumor growth in
rodent and human models (58, 59), whereas indirect obser-
vational evidence (increased stearic to oleic acid ratio in
RBCs) is consistent with SCD activity linked to breast cancer
risk (45).

This is a short-term study, and it is difficult to draw any
firm conclusions about the effects of long-term DER. It is un-
known which changes persist in the long-term when finally
a desirable weight is achieved and weight stabilizes. In com-
mon with our study, most previous reports have assessed
changes in gene expression during energy restriction and
the dynamic phase of weight loss (16, 53). One report finds
that most changes observed during dynamic phase of weight
loss were reversed or attenuated during a 5-week weight sta-
bilization phase (18). The beneficial changes in gene expres-
sion seen with weight loss are therefore mostly linked to
energy restriction. Periods of intermittent restriction may
thus be required to maintain these beneficial effects (10). En-
ergy restriction is known to reduce cell proliferation and
increase apoptotic rate in both normal tissues and cancers
(60–63). The inhibition of glycolysis has been shown to im-
pair the growth of tumor cells (64, 65), and suppression of
glycolysis and fatty acid synthesis specifically in the breast
epithelium may prevent breast carcinomas from developing
and progressing.

In summary, we have done the first DER study to character-
ize gene expression changes in premenopausal normal human
breast tissue. Common differentially expressed genes and
pathways in breast and abdominal tissue suggests that
short-term energy restriction may influence breast cancer risk
at the molecular level. We have identified targets that may re-
spond to chemoprophylactic mimetic agents.

ABSTRACT
ObjeCtive
To evaluate the association between fruit and 
vegetable intake during adolescence and early 
adulthood and risk of breast cancer.
Design
Prospective cohort study.
setting
Health professionals in the United States.
PartiCiPants
90 476 premenopausal women aged 27-44 from the 
Nurses’ Health Study II who completed a questionnaire 
on diet in 1991 as well as 44 223 of those women who 
completed a questionnaire about their diet during 
adolescence in 1998.
Main OutCOMe Measure
 Incident cases of invasive breast cancer, identified 
through self report and confirmed by pathology report.
results
There were 3235 cases of invasive breast cancer during 
follow-up to 2013. Of these, 1347 cases were among 
women who completed a questionnaire about their 
diet during adolescence (ages 13-18). Total fruit 
consumption during adolescence was associated with 
a lower risk of breast cancer. The hazard ratio was 0.75 
(95% confidence interval 0.62 to 0.90; P=0.01 for 
trend) for the highest (median intake 2.9 servings/day) 
versus the lowest (median intake 0.5 serving/day) fifth 
of intake. The association for fruit intake during 
adolescence was independent of adult fruit intake. 
There was no association between risk and total fruit 
intake in early adulthood and total vegetable intake in 
either adolescence or early adulthood. Higher early 
adulthood intake of fruits and vegetables rich in α 

WhAT IS AlReAdy knoWn on ThIS TopIC
Fruit and vegetable consumption has been hypothesized to protect against breast 
cancer but the overall evidence has not been supportive
Most studies have assessed intakes during midlife and later, which could be after 
the period when breast tissue is more vulnerable to carcinogenic influences
WhAT ThIS STudy AddS
Fruit intake during adolescence seem beneficial in terms of preventing breast 
cancer
Higher intake of fruit and vegetables rich in α carotene during early adulthood was 
specifically associated with lower risk
The associations with breast cancer differed significantly among individual fruits 
and vegetables: greater consumption of apple, orange, banana, grapes, and kale 
was significantly associated with a reduced risk

carotene was associated with lower risk of 
premenopausal breast cancer. The hazard ratio was 
0.82 (0.70 to 0.96) for the highest fifth (median intake 
0.5 serving/day) versus the lowest fifth (median intake 
0.03 serving/day) intake. The association with 
adolescent fruit intake was stronger for both estrogen 
and progesterone receptor negative cancers than 
estrogen and progesterone receptor positive cancers 
(P=0.02 for heterogeneity). For individual fruits and 
vegetables, greater consumption of apple, banana, 
and grapes during adolescence and oranges and kale 
during early adulthood was significantly associated 
with a reduced risk of breast cancer. Fruit juice intake 
in adolescence or early adulthood was not associated 
with risk.
COnClusiOn
There is an association between higher fruit intake and 
lower risk of breast cancer. Food choices during 
adolescence might be particularly important.

Introduction
Fruits and vegetables are important sources of fiber, 
vitamins, and other biologically active substances that 
can favorably affect the pathogenesis of breast cancer 
through several biological mechanisms.1-3 Results from 
epidemiological studies assessing fruit and vegetable 
intake and risk of breast cancer, however, have been 
inconsistent.4-16 A recent pooled analysis of 20 prospec-
tive studies showed an inverse association between veg-
etable intake and estrogen receptor negative tumors, 
but not with estrogen receptor positive tumors or breast 
cancer overall.17  All these results, however, were from 
dietary assessments during mid-life or later; the role of 
fruit  and  vegetable  intake  in  earlier  life  is  unclear. 
Breast tissue might be particularly susceptible to car-
cinogenic exposures during childhood and early adult 
life, as seen in women exposed to ionizing radiation.18-20
We  used  unique  information  on  diet  in  early  life 
in  the  Nurses’  Health  Study  II  (NHSII)  to  conduct  a 
detailed analysis of associations between fruit and veg-
etable intake during adolescence and early adulthood 
and risk of breast cancer. This included consideration 
of tumor hormone receptor and menopausal status at 
diagnosis and the relation of specific fruits and vegeta-
bles to risk.

Methods
study population
The NHSII is an ongoing prospective cohort study that 
began in 1989 with enrollment of 116 430 female regis-
tered nurses aged 25-42. Our analyses included 97 813

women who returned the 1991 food frequency question-
naire (FFQ). We excluded women with implausible total 
energy intake (<2508 kJ or 14 630 kJ (<600 or >3500 
kcal)/day) or who left all items on fruit and/or vegeta-
bles blank in the questionnaire and those who were 
postmenopausal in 1991, had missing information on 
age, or had previously had cancer (except non-mela-
noma  skin  cancer)  before  the  recruitment  question-
naire. The primary analyses included 90 476 women. 
The follow-up rate was over 96% of total potential per-
son years from 1991 to 2013.

In 1997, participants were asked about their willing-
ness to complete a supplemental food frequency ques-
tionnaire  about  diet  during  high  school  (age  range 
13-18) (HS-FFQ). Among 47 355 of women who returned 
the HS-FFQ in 1998, we excluded those who had had 
cancer (except non-melanoma skin cancer) before 1998, 
reported implausible daily caloric intake (<2508 kJ or 
20 900 kJ (<600 or ≥5000 kcal)), or who left all items on 
fruit and/or vegetables blank. Thus we evaluated ado-
lescent fruit and vegetable intake and risk of breast can-
cer in 44 223 women. The follow-up rate was over 98% 
of total potential person years from 1998 through 2013.

Dietary assessment
In 1991 and every four years thereafter, dietary intake 
and alcohol consumption were measured with a vali-
dated semiquantitative FFQ with about 130 items about 
usual dietary intake and alcohol consumption during 
the past year (available at http://www.nurseshealth-
study.org/participants/questionnaires). Validity of the 
questionnaire to assess long term intake was evaluated 
by comparison with weighed diet records collected over 
a period of six years; the average correlation for dietary 
nutrient intakes, corrected for variation in diet records, 
was 0.83.21  In addition, higher fruit and/or vegetable 
intake assessed by this questionnaire has been associ-
ated with lower risks of diabetes22  and coronary heart 
disease,23  indirectly supporting the validity of the ques-
tionnaire. We asked women about the frequency of con-
sumption of fruits and vegetables in nine categories 
ranging from “never or less than once per month” to “6 
or more times per day.” Total fruit, fruit juice and vege-
table items listed on the questionnaire are presented in 
appendix table A. Vegetables were categorized into five 
subgroups including green leafy vegetables, yellow/
orange vegetables, tomatoes, cruciferous vegetables, 
and other vegetables. Fruits were grouped into seven 
subgroups including citrus fruits, berries, pomes (fruits 
with a core of several small seeds), drupes (fruits with a 
stone),  tropical  fruits,  grapes,  and  melon.  We  also 
grouped fruits and vegetables by their content of vita-
min C (≥40 mg/100 g), α carotene (≥3000 µg α caro-
tene/100 g), β carotene (≥3000 µg/100 g), or lutein (≥10 
mg/100 g) (appendix table A).23-27

We evaluated diet in adolescence with a FFQ that 
included 124 foods typically consumed between 1960 
and  1980  when  participants  were  in  high  school 
(HS-FFQ, see appendix table B). We categorized intakes 
of  fruits  and  vegetables  similar  to  early  adulthood 
intakes.  The  validity  of  the  HS-FFQ  was  evaluated 

among 80 young women who completed three 24 hour 
recalls and two FFQ during high school with the HS-FFQ 
administered 10 years later; the mean of corrected cor-
relation  coefficients  for  energy  adjusted  nutrient 
intakes was 0.58 for the HS-FFQ and the earlier FFQ’s 
and 0.45 for the HS-FFQ and the earlier 24 hour recalls.28  
Furthermore, evidence of validity and reproducibility 
also came from the comparison of their dietary reports 
with the information provided four years later. In 2002, 
HS-FFQ was readministrated to 333 women who ran-
domly  selected  from  those  initial  participants.  The 
mean Pearson correlation was 0.65 (0.50-0.77) for 38 
nutrient intakes, and the mean Spearman rank correla-
tion was 0.60 (0.37-0.77) for food intakes.29  In addition, 
validity  was  assessed  by  comparing  adolescent  diet 
reported  by  272  NHS  II  participants  with  their  diet 
reported by their mothers; the mean correlation was 
0.40 for nutrients.29

identification of cases of breast cancer
In  follow-up  questionnaires  administered  every  two 
years, we asked women about diagnosis of breast can-
cer and the date of diagnosis. Deaths were reported by 
family members and the postal service in response to 
the follow-up questionnaires or identified through the 
National Death Index. When a case of breast cancer was 
identified, we asked the participant (or next of kin for 
those who had died) for permission to obtain relevant 
hospital records and pathology reports. Because accu-
racy was high for self reporting (99%), we included in 
the analysis cases in women with unavailable medical 
records (n=547). Estrogen receptor and progesterone 
receptor status of tumors was extracted from medical 
records.

assessment of other variables
We obtained data on potential risk factors for breast 
cancer from the biennial NHSII questionnaires includ-
ing age, height, weight, history of benign breast dis-
ease, family history of breast cancer, smoking, race, 
menopausal  status,  menopausal  hormone  use,  oral 
contraceptive use, and physical activity, updated to the 
most recent information, if available. Participants pro-
vided informed consent by returning their question-
naires. Body mass index (BMI) at age 18 and alcohol 
consumption  in  adolescence  was  obtained  from  the 
1989 questionnaire. Women were considered as pre-
menopausal if they still had periods or had had a hys-
terectomy with at least one ovary remaining and were 
aged  under  46  for  smokers  or  48  for  non-smokers. 
Women  were  considered  postmenopausal  if  they 
reported natural menopause or had undergone bilat-
eral  oophorectomy.  We  defined  women  of  unknown 
menopausal status or who had hysterectomy without 
bilateral oophorectomy as postmenopausal if they were 
aged ≥54 for smokers or ≥56 for non-smokers.30

statistical analysis
Food intakes reported in 1991, when participants were 
aged 27-44, were considered as early adulthood dietary 
intake. To evaluate diet in early adulthood and breast

cancer, participants contributed person years from the 
date of return of the 1991 questionnaire until the date of 
any  diagnosis  of  cancer  except  non-melanoma  skin 
cancer, death, or end of follow-up period (1 June 2013), 
whichever occurred first. For adolescent fruit, vegeta-
ble, and fruit juice intake, participants contributed per-
son years similarly except that follow-up began with 
return of the adolescent diet questionnaire in 1998. Par-
ticipants  were  divided  into  fifths  according  to  their 
dietary  intake.  We  used  Cox  proportional  hazards 
regression  to  estimate  hazard  ratios  and  95%  confi-
dence intervals for each category, using the lowest fifth 
of intake as the reference category. To control for con-
founding by age or calendar time, or any possible two 
way interactions between these two time scales, the 
regression models included age in months as the time 
scale, stratified by calendar year of the current ques-
tionnaire cycle. Multivariable models also simultane-
ously  adjusted  for  race,  history  of  breast  cancer  in 
mother  or  sisters,  history  of  benign  breast  disease, 
smoking, height, physical activity, BMI at age 18, weight 
change since age 18, age at menarche, parity and age at 
first birth, oral contraceptive use, menopausal status, 
menopausal  hormone  use,  age  at  menopause,  and 
intakes of alcohol and energy.

For  adolescent  fruit,  vegetable,  and  fruit  juice 
intake and risk of breast cancer, multivariable models 
adjusted additionally for adolescent alcohol intake 
and adolescent energy intake (instead of early adult-
hood energy intake). The median value for each fifth 
was used for tests for trend, modeled as a continuous 
variable. We also used a likelihood ratio test to deter-
mine a potential non-linear association by comparing 
the model with only the linear term to the model with 
both  the  linear  and  the  cubic  spline  terms.  We 
replaced missing covariate data with carried forward 
method for continuous variables and missing indica-
tor method for categorical variables. To examine if the 
observed associations were independent of a gener-
ally healthy dietary pattern, we further adjusted for a 
modified  alternate  healthy  eating  index31  that 
excluded the scores for fruits and vegetables to avoid 
redundancy with our primary variables. We further 
examined whether the associations between fruit and 
vegetable intake and risk of breast cancer depended 
on the other dietary factors, including intake of fiber, 
vitamin C, β carotene, animal fat, and total red meat, 
and  we  additionally  adjusted  for  these  variables 
as well. To better represent adolescent intakes and 
show  that  these  associations  were  independent  of 
 adulthood  dietary  intakes,  we  adjusted  for  dietary 
intake during adult life (cumulative average dietary 
intakes).

Because dietary intake has been assumed to influ-
ence risk of breast cancer over an extended period of 
time, for a sensitivity analyses, we calculated the aver-
age of adolescent and early adult (1991) fruit, vegeta-
ble,  and  fruit  juice  intake  among  those  with 
information for both periods. We also calculated pre-
menopausal cumulative average of dietary intakes by 
using the 1991, 1995, 1999, 2003, 2007, and 2011 dietary

intake  data,  stopping  updating  when  a  woman 
reached menopause. To examine potential effect mod-
ification by BMI at age 18 on associations between fruit 
and vegetable consumption and risk, we included a 
cross-product term of the ordinal score for BMI at age 
18 and fruit or vegetable intakes in the multivariable 
model.  Tests  for  interactions  were  obtained  from  a 
likelihood ratio test. Furthermore, to evaluate whether 
associations  varied  by  age,  we  conducted  tests  for 
interaction and performed analyses separately among 
women aged 27-35 and 36-44 at baseline. To evaluate 
the difference between premenopausal and postmeno-
pausal  hazard  ratios,  we  evaluated  the  P  value  for 
 heterogeneity with the Q statistic.32 33  To examine dif-
ferential  associations  of  fruit  and  vegetable  intake 
with risk of breast cancer by hormone receptor status 
(both  estrogen  and  progesterone  receptor  positive, 
both estrogen and progesterone receptor negative, and 
estrogen receptor positive and progesterone receptor 
negative34 ) we used Cox proportional cause specific 
hazards regression model with a duplication method 
for competing risk data.35 All P values were two sided. 
SAS version 9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary NC) was used for 
all analyses.

Patient involvement
No patients were involved in setting the research ques-
tion or the outcome measures, nor were they involved in 
the design and implementation of the study. There are 
no plans to involve patients in dissemination.

Results
During 22 years of follow-up, we documented 3235 cases 
of invasive breast cancer for the early adulthood dietary 
analyses. Of these, 1347 cases were in women for whom 
we had adolescent dietary information. A higher fruit 
intake in early adulthood and adolescence was associ-
ated with lower prevalence of smoking, , lower intakes 
of  alcohol  and  animal  fat,  and  higher  fiber  intake 
(tables 1 and 2 ). Women with higher intakes of vegeta-
bles during early adulthood were more likely to drink 
alcohol and to have higher fiber intake and were less 
likely to eat animal fat, to smoke, and to be nulliparous 
(table 1).

Fruit and vegetable intake during adolescence and 
risk of breast cancer
A higher total fruit intake during adolescence was asso-
ciated with a lower risk of breast cancer (hazard ratio 
(for highest v lowest fifth of intake) 0.75, 95% confi-
dence  interval  0.62  to  0.90;  Ptrend=0.01).  Although 
women in third and fifth category seemed to have a sim-
ilar lower risk compared with those with the lowest 
intake,  a  test  for  non-linearity  was  not  significant 
(P=0.11). The association was significant for postmeno-
pausal (0.69, 0.52 to 0.90; Ptrend=0.02) but not premeno-
pausal  breast  cancer  (0.80,  0.60  to  1.05;  Ptrend=0.17). 
There was, however, no significant difference between 
premenopausal  and  postmenopausal  hazard  ratios 
(P=0.45 for differences in hazard ratios) (table 3). These 
associations were materially unchanged with adjustment

for intake of vitamin C, β carotene, animal fat, red meat, 
or modified alternate healthy eating index (appendix 
table C). Adjustment for adult fruit intake did not affect 
the associations (hazard ratio for highest v lowest 0.76 
(0.63 to 0.93; Ptrend=0.04) among all women; 0.87 (0.64 
to 1.19; Ptrend=0.55) among premenopausal women; and 
0.67 (0.50 to 0.89; Ptrend=0.02) among postmenopausal 
women). The estimate was attenuated but remained 
significant after adjustment for adolescent total dietary 
fiber intake (0.80 (0.64 to 0.99; Ptrend=0.14) among all 
women; appendix table C).

The association between adolescent vegetable con-
sumption and risk was non-linear (P=0.03); the relation 
seemed to follow a dose-response inverse association 
up  to  2.7  servings/day.  Non-significant  associations 
between adolescent vegetable intake and breast cancer 
were observed (table 4). Higher total fruit and vegetable 
intake during adolescence was associated with lower 
risk of breast cancer (hazard ratio (for highest v lowest 
fifth of intake) 0.82, 0.68 to 0.98; Ptrend=0.07) (table 5 ). 
Adolescent fruit juice intake was not associated with 
risk  (table  6 ).  We  did  not  observe  any  significant

 associations between subgroups of adolescent vegeta-
ble intake and risk of cancer, but the power was limited 
and the confidence intervals were wide (appendix table 
D). For adolescent diet, the highest intakes of pomes, 
tropical fruits, grapes, and melon were each associated 
with lower risk (appendix table E). When we evaluated 
the associations with intakes of individual fruits and 
vegetables  (fig  1)  during  adolescence  as  continuous 
variables in multivariate models, we observed signifi-
cant inverse associations for each two servings/week 
grapes, bananas, and apples and a positive association 
for other fruit juice, and mixed vegetables.

Fruit and vegetable intake during early adulthood 
and risk of breast cancer
Total fruit intake during early adulthood was not signifi-
cantly associated with a lower risk of breast cancer (haz-
ard ratio (for highest v lowest fifth of intake) 0.96, 95% 
confidence interval 0.85 to 1.09; Ptrend=0.46) (table 7 ). 
Similar estimates were noted after additional adjust-
ment for red meat intake or modified alternate healthy 
eating index (appendix table F). Non-significant associ-
ations between early adulthood fruit intake and breast 
cancer were observed among both premenopausal and 
postmenopausal women at diagnosis (table 7 ). Risk of

RESEARCH

breast cancer was not significantly associated with total 
vegetable, total fruit and vegetable, or fruit juice intake 
during early adulthood (tables 8-10). We did not detect 
any  significant  non-linearity  for  fruits  or  vegetables 
intake in early adulthood in relation to risk of breast 
cancer  (P=0.85  for  non-linearity  for  total  fruits  and 
P=0.56 for non-linearity for total vegetables). For early 
adult diet, the highest intakes of yellow/orange vegeta-
bles (0.89, 0.79 to 0.99; Ptrend=0.16) and fruits and vegeta-
bles rich in α carotene (0.89, 0.80 to 1.00; Ptrend=0.28) 
were each associated with lower risk but tests for trend 
were  not  significant.  Stronger  associations  were 
observed among women who were premenopausal at 
diagnosis  (0.85  (0.72  to  0.99;  Ptrend=0.11)  for  yellow/
orange  vegetables;  0.82  (0.70  to  0.96;  Ptrend=0.06)  for 
fruits and vegetables rich in α carotene) (appendix table 
G).  We  did  not  observe  any  significant  associations 
between subgroups of early adulthood fruit intake and 
risk (appendix H). When evaluating the associations 

with intakes of individual fruits and vegetables (fig 1) 
during  early  adulthood  in  multivariate  models,  we 
observed significant inverse associations for each two 
servings/week of oranges and kale and a positive associ-
ation for orange juice.

average fruit and vegetable intake during 
adolescence and early adulthood and risk of breast 
cancer
Fruit intake in adolescence and early adulthood (1991) 
was moderately correlated (r=0.43), as was vegetable 
intake  in  adolescence  and  early  adulthood  (r=0.42). 
Among women with both early adulthood and adoles-
cent dietary data (n=41 032), there were non-significant 
associations between average of total fruit intake and 
overall breast cancer (hazard ratio (for highest v lowest 
fifth of intake) 0.88, 95% confidence interval 0.73 to 
1.06; Ptrend=0.08), premenopausal breast cancer (0.82, 
0.61 to 1.10; Ptrend=0.03), and postmenopausal breast

cancer (0.91, 0.69 to 1.19; Ptrend=0.55). Average of adoles-
cent and early adulthood vegetable intake was associ-
ated with lower risk of premenopausal breast cancer 
(0.74, 0.55 to 0.98; Ptrend=0.05) but not lower risk of over-
all breast cancer (0.85, 0.71 to 1.03; Ptrend=0.18) or post-
menopausal breast cancer (0.93, 0.71 to 1.22; Ptrend=0.63).

Cumulative average of premenopausal fruit and 
vegetable intake and risk of breast cancer
When we examined cumulative average of premeno-
pausal fruit intake, we observed similar risk estimates 
among all women (hazard ratio (for highest v lowest 
fifth of intake) 0.91, 95% confidence interval 0.81 to 1.03; 

Ptrend=0.05),  for  premenopausal  breast  cancer  (0.96, 
0.82 to 1.14; Ptrend=0.57), and for postmenopausal breast 
cancer (0.87, 0.71 to 1.07; Ptrend=0.12). Cumulative aver-
age of premenopausal vegetable intake was not associ-
ated  with  risk  of  breast  cancer  (data  not  shown). 
Cumulative average of fruit juice intake before meno-
pause, however, was positively associated with risk of 
premenopausal  breast  cancer  (1.18,  1.01  to  1.39; 
Ptrend=0.06).

for  both  estrogen  and  progesterone  receptors,  and 
estrogen receptor positive and progesterone receptor 
negative was significant only for adolescent but not 
early adulthood total fruit intake (table 11). The inverse 
association with adolescent fruit intake was stronger 
for both estrogen and progesterone receptor negative 
cancers (hazard ratio 0.70, 95% confidence interval 

0.57  to  0.86,  per  serving/day)  compared  with  both 
estrogen and progesterone receptor positive cancers 
(0.91, 0.83 to 1.00) and estrogen receptor positive and 
progesterone receptor negative (1.03, 0.82 to 1.29) (Phet-
erogeneity=0.02).  Associations  between  total  vegetable 
intake and risk of breast cancer did not differ signifi-
cantly by estrogen and progesterone receptor positive

We also examined whether the association between 
fruit or vegetable intake and risk of breast cancer dif-
fered by levels of BMI at age 18. No significant interac-
tion was observed between BMI at age 18 and either 
adolescent or early adulthood fruit and vegetable intake 
(data not shown). Also, we found no significant interac-
tion between age at baseline and early adulthood fruit 
and vegetable intake (data not shown).

discussion
This prospective study provides evidence that greater 
consumption of fruits during adolescence is associated 
with lower risk of breast cancer. Furthermore, higher 
intake of fruits and vegetables rich in α carotene during 
early adulthood was specifically associated with lower 

risk. The associations with breast cancer differed sig-
nificantly  among  individual  fruits  and  vegetables: 
greater  consumption  of  apple,  banana,  and  grapes 
during adolescence, as well as oranges and kale during 
early adulthood, was significantly associated with a 
reduced risk.

strengths and weaknesses of the study
Our study has several strengths. To evaluate the impor-
tance of timing, we assessed the association between 
fruit and vegetable intake during specific life periods 
(adolescence, early adulthood, and cumulative aver-
age of the premenopausal period). The relatively large 
number of cases gave adequate power for us to detect 
modest differences in risk as well as examination of 
breast cancers by menopausal and hormone receptor 
status. Although a question was recently raised about

the  value  of  dietary  assessments  from  self  reported 
information,36  and refuted elsewhere,37  the question-
naire we used has documented validity,21-23  as shown 
by  strong  correlations  between  nutrient  intakes 
assessed by the food frequency questionnaire and by 
weighed diet records and by many different biomarkers 
of diet.21  Also, higher intake of fruits and vegetables 
assessed by the questionnaire we used has predicted 
lower risks of diabetes22  and coronary heart disease.23  
Further,  intakes  of  specific  fruits  and  vegetables 
assessed by this questionnaire robustly predict plasma 
carotenoid concentrations.38

Potential  limitations  also  need  to  be  considered. 
First, the participants were restricted to nurses and 
predominantly white women, which could reduce gen-
eralizability; however, it is unlikely that the biology 
underlying these associations differs by race or educa-
tion.39 40   Second, adolescent diet might be misclassi-
fied  because  assessments  were  done  when  women 
were  aged  33-52.  The  associations,  however,  were 
largely independent of adult diet, and comparisons of 
diet recorded during adolescence and our question-
naire administered 10 years later showed good valid-
ity.29  Further,  because  diet  was  assessed  before 
diagnosis, misclassification would tend to obscure, not 
cause,  associations.  Third,  residual  confounding  is 
possible as women who eat a lot of fruit and vegetables 
might have healthier lifestyles. Adjustment for poten-
tial confounders, including other aspects of diet, how-
ever, had minimal effects on associations. Fourth, our 
observation  of  borderline  significant  association 
between early adulthood intake of fruits and vegeta-
bles  rich  in  α  carotene  and  breast  cancer  warrants 

 cautious interpretation. Fifth, while adolescent fruit 
consumption was inversely associated with risk, early 
adulthood  fruit  consumption  was  non-significantly 
inversely associated with risk. Whereas the results are 
not entirely consistent, they are in line with the hypoth-
esis that breast tissue is more vulnerable to carcino-
genic exposure in earlier life than later. Sixth, we made 
multiple comparisons (different food groups; premeno-
pausal and postmenopausal subgroups, and subtype 
of tumors) in this analysis, and we cannot exclude the 
possibility of type I errors. The central finding of an 
association with fruits and vegetables, however, was 
the  primary  a  priori  hypothesis,  the  other  analyses 
were directed to an understanding of this association.

results in relation to other studies
Fruit and vegetable intake has been hypothesized to 
protect against breast cancer, but the overall evidence 
is  conflicting.  Although  the  European  Prospective 
Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study 
with about 330 000 women from 10 European countries 
found no association between consumption of fruits 
and  vegetables  and  risk  of  breast  cancer,16   a  recent 
pooled analysis including 993 466 women from 20 pro-
spective cohort studies, which included NHSII, suggests 
that the associations with fruit and vegetable intake 
varied depended on breast cancer hormone receptor 
status; modest inverse associations were apparent only 
for  vegetable  intake  and  estrogen  receptor  negative 
breast cancer.17 Our current results show that high fruit 
intake during adolescence is associated with reduced 
overall risk, with stronger results for both estrogen and 
progesterone receptors negative tumors.

biological plausibility
Several bioactive components in fruits and vegeta-
bles, such as carotenoids, vitamin C, flavonoids, fiber, 
magnesium, and potassium, could act through multi-
ple mechanisms to promote a beneficial effect on risk 
of breast cancer.1-41  Our own study using data from 
NHSII indicated that high intake of fiber during ado-
lescence  and  early  adulthood  was  associated  with 
decreased risk in later life.3  Furthermore, a meta-anal-
ysis of 16 prospective studies showed an inverse asso-
ciation  between  fiber  intake  and  risk.41   We  found 
differences in the results for adolescent fruit intake 
when we additionally adjusted for fiber. The associa-
tion, however, was still significant and suggests there 
might  be  other  mechanisms  in  addition  to  fiber 
through which fruit consumption could reduce risk. 
Further, we noted inverse associations for intake of 
fruits and vegetables rich in α carotene during early 
adulthood  and  risk  of  breast  cancer.  The  Nurses’ 
Health Study also reported a lower risk of estrogen 
receptor negative breast cancer with high intake of 
yellow/orange  vegetables.42   Although  individual 
studies  did  not  observe  an  association  between 
dietary and circulating vitamin C or carotenoids and 
breast cancer,43-45  a recent pooled analysis of eight 
prospective studies found that higher circulating lev-
els  of  carotenoids  were  associated  with  decreased 
risk, with stronger associations for estrogen receptor 
negative tumors.2  Further analyses of dietary α and β 
carotene intake in another pooled analysis suggested 
protective effects of carotenoids for estrogen receptor 
negative  breast  cancer.46  Our  findings  suggest  that 
high  intake  of  fruits  and  vegetables  rich  in  carot-
enoids in early adulthood could be associated with a 
decreased risk of breast cancer.

Conclusions
In summary, our findings suggest that high intake of 
fruit  during  adolescence  could  be  associated  with  a 
lower risk of breast cancer. The consumption of fruits 
and vegetables rich in α carotene might be particularly 
important.  We  also  observed  that  the  associations 
between adolescent fruit intake and breast cancer dif-
fered  by  hormone  receptor  status,  with  a  stronger 
inverse association for both estrogen and progesterone 
receptor negative cancer. We noted that 2.9 servings/day 
fruit  consumption  (highest  fifth)  during  adolescent 
compared with 0.5 serving/day (lowest fifth) was asso-
ciated with about a 25% lower risk of breast cancer. If 
this apparent risk reduction is applied to lifetime risk of 
breast cancer, the absolute number of breast cancers 
that could potentially be prevented by higher intake of 
fruits would be substantial. Also, in decisions about 
fruit consumption, other consequences should be con-
sidered, and these include lower risks of diabetes and 
cardiovascular disease. Our findings are in line with 
cancer  prevention  recommendations47  to  consume 
more fruits and vegetables and support the adoption of 
these behaviors in early life. Further study of the rela-
tion between diet in early life and risk of breast cancer 
is needed.

abstract

background
The influence of excess body weight on the risk of death from cancer has not been fully
characterized.

methods
In a prospectively studied population of more than 900,000 U.S. adults (404,576 men
and 495,477 women) who were free of cancer at enrollment in 1982, there were 57,145
deaths from cancer during 16 years of follow-up. We examined the relation in men and
women between the body-mass index in 1982 and the risk of death from all cancers
and from cancers at individual sites, while controlling for other risk factors in multivari-
ate proportional-hazards models. We calculated the proportion of all deaths from can-
cer that was attributable to overweight and obesity in the U.S. population on the basis of
risk estimates from the current study and national estimates of the prevalence of over-
weight and obesity in the U.S. adult population.

results
The heaviest members of this cohort (those with a body-mass index [the weight in kilo-
grams divided by the square of the height in meters] of at least 40) had death rates from
all cancers combined that were 52 percent higher (for men) and 62 percent higher (for
women) than the rates in men and women of normal weight. For men, the relative risk
of death was 1.52 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.13 to 2.05); for women, the relative
risk was 1.62 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.40 to 1.87). In both men and women,
body-mass index was also significantly associated with higher rates of death due to
cancer of the esophagus, colon and rectum, liver, gallbladder, pancreas, and kidney; the
same was true for death due to non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and multiple myeloma. Signif-
icant trends of increasing risk with higher body-mass-index values were observed for
death from cancers of the stomach and prostate in men and for death from cancers of
the breast, uterus, cervix, and ovary in women. On the basis of associations observed in
this study, we estimate that current patterns of overweight and obesity in the United
States could account for 14 percent of all deaths from cancer in men and 20 percent of
those in women.

conclusions
Increased body weight was associated with increased death rates for all cancers com-
bined and for cancers at multiple specific sites.

he relations between excess body
weight  and  mortality,  not  only  from  all
causes but also from cardiovascular dis-
ease,  are  well  established.
  Although  we  have
known for some time that excess weight is also an
7
important factor in death from cancer,
 our knowl-
edge of the magnitude of the relation, both for all
cancers and for cancers at individual sites, and the
public health effect of excess weight in terms of to-
tal mortality from cancer is limited.

8-12

11,13,14

Previous studies have consistently shown asso-
ciations between adiposity and increased risk of
cancers  of  the  endometrium,  kidney,  gallbladder
(in women), breast (in postmenopausal women),
and colon (particularly in men).
 Adenocarci-
noma of the esophagus has been linked to obesi-
ty.
 Data on cancers of the pancreas, prostate,
liver, cervix, and ovary and on hematopoietic cancers
are scarce or inconsistent.
 The lack of con-
sistency may be attributable to the limited number
of  studies  (especially  those  with  prospective  co-
horts), the limited range and variable categorization
of overweight and obesity among studies, bias intro-
duced by reverse causality with respect to smoking-
related cancers, and possibly real differences be-
tween the effects of overweight and obesity on the
incidence of cancer and on the rates of death from
some cancers.

We  conducted  a  prospective  investigation  in  a
large cohort of U.S. men and women to determine
the relations between body-mass index (the weight
in kilograms divided by the square of the height in
meters) and the risk of death from cancer at specific
sites. This cohort has been used previously to exam-
ine the association of body-mass index and death
5
from any cause.

methods

study population
The  men  and  women  in  this  study  were  selected
from the 1,184,617 participants in the Cancer Pre-
vention Study II, a prospective mortality study begun
by the American Cancer Society in 1982.
 The
participants were identified and enrolled by more
than 77,000 volunteers in all 50 states, the District
of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. Families were en-
rolled if at least one household member was 45 years
of age or older and all enrolled members were 30
years of age or older. The average age of the partici-
pants at enrollment was 57 years. In 1982 they com-
pleted a confidential mailed questionnaire that in-

20,21

cluded personal identifiers and elicited information
on demographic characteristics, personal and fam-
ily history of cancer and other diseases, and various
behavioral, environmental, occupational, and di-
etary exposures.

Over 99 percent of deaths that occurred from the
month of enrollment until September 1988 were as-
certained by means of personal inquiries made by
22
volunteers in September 1984, 1986, and 1988.
Approximately 93 percent of all deaths occurring
after September 1988 were ascertained by linkage
 By December 31,
with the National Death Index.
1998,  24.0  percent  of  the  participants  had  died,
75.8 percent were still living, and 0.2 percent were
dropped from follow-up on September 1, 1988, be-
cause of insufficient data for linkage with the Na-
tional Death Index. Death certificates or multiple
cause-of-death codes were obtained for 98.8 percent
of all known deaths.

22

In the base-line questionnaire, the participants
were asked their current weight, weight one year
previously, and height (without shoes). We excluded
from  the  analysis  participants  whose  values  for
height or weight were missing, whose weight one
year before the interview was unknown, or who had
lost more than 10 lb (4.5 kg) in the previous year;
65,436 men and 91,282 women were excluded for
these reasons. We also excluded participants with
below-normal weight according to World Health
Organization guidelines
 as indicated by a body-
mass index of less than 18.5 (3393 men and 15,769
women). In addition, we excluded participants who
had cancer (other than nonmelanoma skin cancer)
at base line (20,839 men and 47,120 women) and
those with missing information on race or smoking
history (14,086 men and 26,639 women). The eli-
gible participants for the current analysis included
404,576 men and 495,477 women. After 16 years of
follow-up, there were a total of 32,303 deaths from
cancer in men and 24,842 deaths from cancer in
women in this population.

23

From the final population of 900,053 partici-
pants, we defined a subgroup of those who had nev-
er  smoked  (107,030  men  and  276,564  women).
Within this subgroup, there were a total of 5314
deaths from cancer among men and 11,648 among
women. This subgroup provided us with an oppor-
tunity to evaluate whether the association between
body-mass index and mortality was subject to re-
sidual confounding by smoking status for smok-
ing-related cancers.

body-mass index
The body-mass index, a measure of adiposity, was
categorized as follows: 18.5 to 24.9, 25.0 to 29.9,
30.0 to 34.9, 35.0 to 39.9, and 40.0 or more. These
categories  correspond  to  those  proposed  by  the
World Health Organization
 for “normal range,”
“grade 1 overweight,” “grade 2 overweight” (30.0
to 39.9), and “grade 3 overweight,” respectively.
For many analyses, especially for cancers in spe-
cific sites and among participants who had never
smoked, the upper categories of body-mass index
were combined, because of the small numbers. In
our analyses and discussion, we refer to the range
of 25.0 to 29.9 as corresponding to “overweight”
and to values of 30.0 or more as corresponding to
“obesity.”

In  all  primary  analyses,  the  body-mass  index
category of 18.5 to 24.9 (“normal range”) was con-
sidered  the  reference  group.  We  also  conducted
analyses in which we divided this group into two
categories of 18.5 to 22.9 and 23.0 to 24.9 and con-
sidered the lower category to be the reference group.

24

mortality end points
The end points in our analyses were deaths from all
cancers (codes 140.0 to 195.8 and 199.0 to 208.9 of
International Classification of Diseases,
Ninth Revision
the 
 
[ICD-9])
 and from cancers at selected sites. Spe-
cific cancers accounting for at least 150 deaths in
men and 150 deaths in women included esophageal
cancer (ICD-9 codes 150.0 to 150.9), stomach can-
cer (151.0 to 151.9), colorectal cancer (153.0 to
154.8), liver cancer (155.0 to 155.2), gallbladder
cancer (156.0 to 156.9), pancreatic cancer (157.0 to
157.9),  lung  cancer  (162.0  to  162.9),  melanoma
(172.0 to 172.9), breast cancer in women (174.0 to
174.9), cancer of the corpus and uterus, not other-
wise specified (179 and 182.0 to 182.8), cervical
cancer (180.0 to 180.9), ovarian cancer (183.0 to
183.9),  prostate  cancer  (185),  bladder  cancer
(188.0 to 188.9), kidney cancer (189.0 to 189.9),
brain cancer (191.0 to 191.9), non-Hodgkin’s lym-
phoma (202.0 to 202.9), multiple myeloma (203.0
to 203.8), and leukemia (204.0 to 208.9). All other
specific  cancers  that  contributed  to  total  deaths
from cancer but that caused fewer than 150 deaths
or were coded as unspecified (199.0 to 199.1) were
analyzed as a separate category of “other” cancers.
Approximately 11 percent of cancers in both men
and women fell into the “other” category. Of these,
45 percent had a specific (coded) site and caused
fewer  than  150  deaths  and  55  percent  had  a  site

that  was  coded  as  unspecified.  Data  regarding
cancer  subsites  or  histologic  findings  were  not
available.

information on covariates
Potential  confounders  included  in  data  analyses
were age (in single years), race (white, black, or
other), smoking status (never smoked, formerly
smoked, or currently smokes, with three categories
of cigarettes smoked per day: 0 to 19, 20, and more
than 20), education (less than high school, high-
school graduate, some college, or college graduate),
physical activity (none, slight, moderate, or heavy),
alcohol use (none, less than one drink per day, one
drink per day, or two or more drinks per day), mar-
ital status (not married or married), current aspirin
use (use or nonuse), a crude index of fat consump-
tion (estimated grams per week for 20 food items,
with  the  participants  divided  into  three  roughly
equal groups),
 and vegetable consumption (the
frequency per week of consumption of nine vege-
tables — not including potatoes — with partici-
pants divided into three roughly equal groups), and
status with respect to estrogen-replacement therapy
in women (never used, currently used, or formerly
used).

25

statistical analysis
Age-adjusted death rates were calculated for each
category  of  body-mass  index  and  were  directly
standardized  to the age distribution of the entire
male or female study population. Relative risks (the
age-adjusted death rate in a specific body-mass-
index category divided by the corresponding rate in
the reference category [18.50 to 24.99]) were com-
puted; the 95 percent confidence intervals used ap-
proximate variance formulas.

26,27

We also used Cox proportional-hazards model-
28
 to compute relative risks and to adjust for oth-
ing
er potential risk factors reported at base line. The
Cox models were stratified according to age at en-
rollment by the inclusion of age (in single years) in
the strata statement of the Cox model. The relative
risks we report are from the multivariate Cox mod-
els,  unless  otherwise  noted.  Tests  of  linear  trend
were performed by scoring the categories of body-
mass index, entering the score as a continuous term
in the regression model, and testing the significance
of the term by the Wald chi-square test.

29

We present results for all cancers combined and
for cancer at each site on the basis of analyses of the
total populations of men and women. For most in-

dividual cancer sites, the association of body-mass
index and mortality was similar whether the analy-
sis was based on the total population or on the pop-
ulation of those who had never smoked. However,
for several cancers known to be related to smoking,
the association between body-mass index and mor-
tality was substantially different in the total popu-
lation and the population of those who had never
smoked. For these cancers (in men, all cancers, lung
cancer, esophageal cancer, pancreatic cancer, and
other cancers; in women, all cancers, lung cancer,
esophageal cancer, and other cancers), the results
from the population of those who had never smoked
are also presented.

Because weight is a modifiable risk factor, we
calculated the population attributable fraction (also
termed population attributable risk, population at-
30
tributable–risk proportion, and excess fraction),

32

an estimate of the proportion of all cancer deaths in
the United States that might be avoided if the adult
population maintained a body-mass index in the
31
normal range. We used methods derived by Walter
and presented by Kleinbaum et al.
 for a multiple-
category  exposure.  In  this  analysis,  calculations
were  based  on  the  multivariate-adjusted  relative
risks for the total population in the Cancer Preven-
tion  Study  II  and  for  the  population  of  those  in
that study who had never smoked and on preva-
lence estimates of overweight and obesity in U.S.
men and women 50 to 69 years of age from the Na-
tional  Health  and  Nutrition  Examination  Survey
  This  calculation  assumes  that
for  1999–2000.
the  relative-risk  estimates  associated  with  over-
weight and obesity that were observed in the cur-
rent study were causal and are generalizable to the
U.S. population.

body-mass index and mortality
from cancer in the total population
of men and women
The numbers of deaths among men were sufficient
to permit only the death rates from all cancers to be

examined separately for the two highest body-mass-
index categories of 35.0 to 39.9 and 40.0 or more.
The relative risks of death for these categories, as
compared with the group of men of normal weight
(body-mass index, 18.5 to 24.9), were 1.20 (95 per-
cent confidence interval, 1.08 to 1.34) and 1.52 (95
percent confidence interval, 1.13 to 2.05), respec-

tively (Table 1). We observed significant positive lin-
ear trends in death rates with increasing body-mass
index for all cancers, esophageal cancer, stomach
cancer, colorectal cancer, liver cancer, gallbladder
cancer, pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer, kidney
cancer, non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, multiple myelo-
ma, and leukemia (Table 1). As compared with men
of normal weight, men with a body-mass index of
at least 35.0 had significantly elevated relative risks
of death from cancer, which ranged from 1.23 (95
percent confidence interval, 1.11 to 1.36) for death
from any cancer to 4.52 (95 percent confidence in-
terval, 2.94 to 6.94) for death from liver cancer (Ta-
ble 1). In the total population of men, a significant
inverse association was observed between body-
mass index and death from lung cancer. We did not
find significant associations between body-mass in-
dex and death from brain cancer, bladder cancer,
melanoma, or “other” cancers. Among men within
the normal weight range, those with a body-mass
index  of  23.0  to  24.9  were  not  at  higher  risk  for
death from cancer than the leanest men (those with
a body-mass index of 18.5 to 22.9), and the observed
associations in men were not larger when a leaner
group of men was used as the reference group (data
not shown).

The results for the total population of women
were similar. Women with a body-mass index of at
least 40.0 had a relative risk of death from any can-
cer of 1.62 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.40 to
1.87), as compared with women of normal weight
(Table 2). Significant positive linear trends in death
rates were observed for colorectal cancer, liver can-
cer, gallbladder cancer, pancreatic cancer, breast
cancer, cancer of the corpus and uterus, not oth-
erwise specified, cervical cancer, ovarian cancer,
kidney cancer, non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, multiple
myeloma, and “other” cancers (Table 2). The high-
est relative risk we observed was for death from uter-
ine cancer (relative risk, 6.25 for women with body-
mass index of at least 40.0; 95 percent confidence
interval, 3.75 to 10.42). As in men, a significant in-
verse  association  between  body-mass  index  and
death from lung cancer was seen in the total popu-
lation, which included smokers. Significant asso-
ciations with body-mass index were not observed
for death from esophageal cancer, stomach cancer,
melanoma, bladder cancer, brain cancer, or leuke-
mia. Although the results for total cancer mortality
in women were virtually unchanged when a leaner
reference group was used (body-mass index, 18.5 to
22.9), there were significant differences within the

normal weight range for cancers of the gallbladder,
breast, and corpus and uterus, resulting in larger
elevations in risk for these cancers throughout the
entire range of overweight and obesity as compared
with the leanest reference group (the relative risk of
death from gallbladder cancer for a body-mass in-
dex of at least 30.0 was 2.44 [95 percent confidence
interval, 1.73 to 3.44]; the relative risks of death
from breast and uterine cancers for a body-mass in-
dex of at least 40.0 were 2.32 [95 percent confidence
interval, 1.54 to 3.50] and 6.87 [95 percent confi-
dence interval, 4.09 to 11.55], respectively).

body-mass index and mortality
from cancer in men and women
who had never smoked

The association between body-mass index and death
from  several  smoking-related  cancers  changed
when the analysis was restricted to men who had
never smoked. The positive associations with death
from any cancer, esophageal cancer, pancreatic can-
cer, and “other” cancers were of greater magnitude
among those who had never smoked than in the
total population, and the apparent inverse associ-
ation  with  death  from  lung  cancer  disappeared
(Table 3).

As  in  men,  the  positive  association  between
body-mass index and death from any cancer, esoph-
ageal cancer, and “other” cancers became stronger
when the analysis was restricted to women who had
never smoked, and the seemingly protective effect
of high body-mass index on mortality from lung
cancer  was  attenuated  (Table  3).  Among  women
who had never smoked, the relative risk of death
from any cancer was 1.88 (95 percent confidence
interval, 1.56 to 2.27) for those with a body-mass
index of at least 40.0, as compared with women of
normal weight.

The relative risks of cancers for which we found
significant trends of increasing death rates with in-
creasing body-mass index are summarized for the
highest categories of body-mass index that we were
able to examine in men (Fig. 1) and women (Fig. 2).

population attributable fraction
We  estimated  the  proportion  of  all  deaths  from
cancer in the U.S. population that are attributable
to overweight and obesity to be from 4.2 percent to
14.2 percent among men and from 14.3 percent
to 19.8 percent among women (Table 4). The lower
estimates are based on relative risks for the entire
population, whereas the higher estimates are based

Figure 1. Summary of Mortality from Cancer According to Body-Mass Index for U.S. Men in the Cancer Prevention 
Study II, 1982 through 1998.
For each relative risk, the comparison was between men in the highest body-mass-index (BMI) category (indicated in pa-
rentheses) and men in the reference category (body-mass index, 18.5 to 24.9). Asterisks indicate relative risks for men

on relative risks for those who never smoked. The
estimates based on relative risks among men and
women who never smoked (Table 4) do not describe
the fraction of deaths attributable to overweight and
obesity  among  this  population  only.  Rather,  they
are estimates of the fraction of deaths attributable
to overweight and obesity in the total U.S. popula-
tion,  on  the  assumption  that  the  relative  risks
among  those  who  never  smoked  offer  the  most
valid estimates of the true effect of overweight and
obesity on mortality from cancer.

discussion

The heaviest men and women (those with a body-
mass index of at least 40.0) in the large cohort we
studied prospectively had death rates from all can-
cers that were 52 percent and 62 percent higher, re-
spectively, than the rates in men and women of nor-
mal weight. This finding is consistent with those of
previous studies, but the magnitude of the effect is
somewhat larger.
 The stronger associations
we found probably reflect our ability to examine
deaths from cancer across a wider range of over-
weight and obesity than has been possible previ-
ously. It is also likely that the stronger associations

7,16,17

18,19

seen in our study reflect a greater effect of body-
mass index on mortality than on incidence of cancer
at some sites.
 These risk estimates are proba-
bly conservative, since they are based on the total
population, including current and former smokers.
Among women who never smoked, the relative risk
associated with a body-mass index of at least 40.0
was 88 percent; however, there were not enough
deaths among men in this category for us to deter-
mine the relative risk.

The proportion of all deaths from cancer that is
attributable to overweight and obesity in U.S. adults
50 years of age or older may be as high as 14 percent
in men and 20 percent in women. These estimates
are based on the relative risks in our study and the
current patterns of overweight and obesity in the
United States. Under the assumption that these re-
lations are causal, the public health implications for
the United States are profound: more than 90,000
deaths per year from cancer might be avoided if ev-
eryone  in  the  adult  population  could  maintain  a
body-mass index under 25.0 throughout life.

The International Agency for Research on Cancer
(IARC) has concluded that there is sufficient evi-
dence of a cancer-preventive effect of avoidance of
weight gain for cancers of the colon, breast (in post-

Two studies that examined obesity and liver can-
cer found an excess risk in both men and women,
 — a
with relative risks in the range of 2.0 to 4.0
result similar to our findings. Our results and those
 suggest that this
of a prospective study in Sweden
excess risk is higher among men than among wom-
en. Obesity also increases the risk of adenocarcino-
ma of the gastric cardia,
 but the data are lim-
ited and inconsistent for noncardia cancers of the
stomach.
 In an earlier American Cancer Society
cohort, as in our study, mortality from stomach can-
cer  was  associated  with  body-mass  index  among
7
men but not among women.
 This difference may
reflect the greater contribution of the cardia to all
cases of gastric cancer in men than in women. Our
results for cervical cancer are also similar to those in
7
 where-
the earlier American Cancer Society cohort,

13,52

as the increased risks observed in two cohorts of
hospitalized patients with a diagnosis of obesity,
as  compared  with  the  general  population,  were

much smaller than those observed in our study.
Data are scarce on the relation between hematopoi-
etic cancers and body-mass index, and the findings
have not been consistent.

7,16,17,53

Our results are based on data on mortality and
reflect the combined influence of body-mass index
both  on  the  incidence  of  cancer  and  on  survival,
whereas most of the available literature on site-spe-
cific cancers is based on incidence data. Our results
may be influenced by adiposity-related differences
in the diagnosis or treatment of cancer, as well as by
true biologic effects of adiposity on survival. For ex-
ample, adiposity has been shown to be adversely as-
sociated with the incidence of breast cancer, survival

tality from breast cancer in our study cohort is some-
what stronger than those in previous studies of in-
cident breast cancer.

Smoking profoundly alters the relation between
body-mass index and many causes of death. We be-
lieve that public health recommendations regarding
optimal body mass are most valid when they are
based on data from studies of persons who have
never smoked.5,57,58 For smoking-related cancers,
the prospective effects of body-mass index on the
risk of death among smokers cannot be separated
from the prospective effects of smoking — namely,
decreased body mass and increased risk of death.
Previous analyses of the Cancer Prevention Study II
cohort demonstrated that the apparent inverse as-
sociation of body-mass index and mortality due to
lung cancer was incrementally attenuated with in-
creasingly complex statistical control for smoking
in multivariate models, and it disappeared entirely
when the analysis was restricted to those who had
never smoked.59 Thus, for smoking-related can-
cers, we believe that the estimates of relative risk
and population attributable fraction presented for
the total population (Tables 1, 2, and 4) are likely
to be underestimates, whereas those presented for
the population of those who never smoked (Tables 3
and 4) offer the most valid estimates of the true ef-
fect  of  overweight  and  obesity  on  mortality  from
these cancers.

We used self-reported weight and height at study
entry to calculate the body-mass index, a widely used
index of weight adjusted for height.60,61 Although

self-reported weight and height are highly correlat-
ed with measured weight and height,62-64 the small
error  that  exists  is  generally  systematic,  with  an
overestimation of height and an underestimation
of weight, especially at higher weights.62-64 Thus,
our measure of body-mass index probably under-
estimated the true body-mass-index values among
overweight persons. We had no direct measure of
adiposity or of lean body mass and no measure of
central adiposity, such as the waist-to-hip ratio. We
also could not evaluate the effect of weight change
or weight cycling throughout the follow-up period,
and we could not estimate the extent of misclassifi-
cation that weight change might introduce. The as-
sociations observed in this study were not changed
in models that excluded deaths in the first two years
of follow-up.

The large size of our cohort allowed us to inves-
tigate the effect of overweight and obesity on the
occurrence  of  57,000  deaths  from  cancer  among
900,000 men and women who were free of cancer
at base line. Overweight and obesity are associated
with  the  risk  of  death  from  all  cancers  and  with
death from cancers at many specific sites. From our
results, we estimate that 90,000 deaths due to cancer
could be prevented each year in the United States if
men and women could maintain normal weight. It
is unlikely that this goal can be achieved without
concerted effort and substantial investment on the
part of policymakers, educators, clinicians, employ-
ers, and schools to promote physical activity and
healthful dietary practices as a cultural norm.
