Although survival increasing improved management, many cancers still carry poor prognosis less susceptible sur- gical, radiotherapeutic chemotherapeutic intervention, either inherent characteristics may detected late stage development. The common cancers diseases adulthood, becoming especially common older age. As population ages cancer prevalence therefore predicted increase. Consequently, policy managing burden cancer population based entirely screening early detection management detected cancers unlikely make marked impact population level except types cancer, also likely increasingly, unsustainably, expensive. Thus, important consider role primary prevention helping reduce clinical, personal, economic social burden cancer. Approximately one- third cancers high-income countries UK attributed smoking(2). Authoritative reviews estimated one-third cancers countries might attributable factors relating food, nutrition physical activity, including body fatness.

This report published November 2007(4). Nutrition cancer process Cancer develops clone cells escaped normal regulation growth, proliferation, differentiation intercellular relationships. These abnormalities function derive disordered expression key genes, resulting altered cellular phenotype. The disordered gene expression may result genetic mutation epigenetic factors may silence genes active switch genes silent. Factors relating food nutrition may directly inﬂuence processes. Food components may act directly mutagens, conversely may interfere action external mutagens either directly facilitating elimination. Nutritional factors may also alter cellular milieu modulating hormonal axes, inﬂuencing growth proliferation amongst speciﬁc cell populations. Finally, regulation processes related speciﬁc nutrients may directly inﬂuence expression key genes, instance abnormalities methylation promoter regions genes histone acetylation, inﬂuence DNA structure accessibility genes mRNA transcription. interaction genotype While clear root cancer disease gene expression, minority cancers appear related inherited single high-penetrance gene mutations. Con- sequently, major determinant cancer risk appears environment. Amongst earliest identiﬁed indicators importance interaction different patterns cancer around world. Low-income countries relatively high rates cancers cervix, stomach, liver oro-pharynx (all least partly related infections), high-income countries characterised higher rates cancers breast, prostate colo- rectum (related alterations hormonal axes)(4). Most striking rapid change cancer patterns, within one two generations, populations migrate. Together secular changes incidence cancers decades, rapid change effectively excludes inherited factors key determinant patterns population level, although clearly may important determining individual risk within populations. The rationale considering food, nutrition physi- cal activity key environmental factors determining cancer risk derives mass epidemiological mechanistic data, recently clinical trials well. The second WCRF/American Institute Cancer Research report commissioned expert Panel review evidence, draw conclusions make recommendations. The process report Cancer result complex process accumulation abnormal phenotypic characteristics among clone cells, usually decades. This complexity timescale present obstacles study pathogenesis natural history, especially preclinical stages. Equally, challenging characterise subjects’ exposure food nutrients, trajectory growth body composition, life course. In circum- stances, clinical trials cannot realistically address short period whole pathogenetic process usually conducted high-risk groups may representative general population. Often dietary intervention form isolated supplements rather real foods, difﬁcult achieve maintain differences intervention control groups real dietary physical activity interventions. Consequently, difﬁcult identify single methodo- logical approaches seen inherently superior. With body evidence comprising different approaches, observational epidemiology basic science, generalisability clinical trials limited, robust conclusions drawn review totality relevant evidence, allowing advantages disadvantages different methods. There accepted approaches synthesising evi- dence inferring likely causality observed associ- ations, proposed 1963 Bradford Hill(5). With view exploring literature Bradford Hill’s framework could applied, WCRF International convened expert Task Force develop standardised method searching literature analysing displaying evidence. This methodology Task Force met 2 years develop speciﬁcation. The feasibility, utility reproducibility speciﬁ- cation manual tested compared two independent academic institutes, using endometrial cancer test case. As result amendments made protocol, ﬁnal version(6) used conduct series systematic literature reviews (SLR) formed basis Panel’s deliberations. It decided keep process data collection, analysis display separate judging it. Thus, nine independent SLR centres, three USA, four UK two continental Europe, commissioned conduct SLR links food, nutrition physical activity seventeen cancer sites. In addition, SLR conducted links weight gain body fatness efﬁcacy nutrition activity interventions individuals already received diagnosis cancer. Finally, review conducted authoritative national international reports made recommendations prevention diseases, recommendations report would set broad public health context. e c S r u N e h f g e e c r P Nutrition support cancer therapy 255 Each SLR team include range expertise, nutrition, epidemiology, statistics, cancer biology, speciﬁc cancer site systematic review. Each SLR peer reviewed protocol draft ﬁnal report stage. WCRF International provided coordinator whose role facilitate process ensure consistency application speciﬁcation. An expert Panel convened, comprising twenty-one internationally-renowned scientists, range exper- tise including nutrition, epidemiology, cancer mechanisms, clinical medicine public health. Chaired Professor Sir Michael Marmot, Panel met 5 years discuss judge evidence SLR, draw conclusions make recommendations. Judging evidence Given complex nature disease process cancer characterisation diet physical activity lifetime, simple hierarchical approach evidence causal links cannot rely randomised controlled trials. Apart obvious inability mask differences dietary interventions based real foods, practical terms equally impossible secure sufﬁ- ciently large sustained differences lifestyle including diet intervention groups. Where studies done often use synthetic supplements isolated nutrients, high dose, high-risk groups, inter- mediate outcomes. Extrapolation studies general population therefore straightforward. However, long-term observational studies cohorts healthy individuals identify hard outcomes (cancer incidence mortality) typical populations consuming real diets decades. Observational studies, however, unlike randomised trials, subject confounding, making causal inferences less robust. The issue identifying important causal associations predominantly observational data trials uninformative new. Bradford Hill 1960s elucidated series characteristics data could provide framework consideration help infer associations likely causal(7). The SLR speciﬁc- ation required data displayed way facilitated application Bradford Hill’s criteria. The evidence displayed judged within framework, likelihood association causal graded according well criteria fulﬁlled. Before evidence presented, Panel agreed set minimum criteria grade. The grades were: convincing; probable; limited; substantial effect risk unlikely. The limited category divided suggestive causal relation conclusion could drawn. In addition, provide ﬂexi- bility, certain characteristics evidence could used upgrade downgrade conclusions. Once conclusions reached, presented graphically form matrix. Matrices pre- sented cancer, identiﬁed exposures categorised according grade conclusion likely causality association. In addition, matrices presented main group exposures, Table 1.

Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention 2151 Materials Methods Participants men clinically localized prostate cancer, elected undergo radical prostatectomy received neoadjuvant therapy. Study activities began within 2 weeks diagnosis. Eligibility criteria included ability implement dietary change, concurrent disease requiring dietary modification, current use hormonal treatments, body mass index >20 kg/m2 <35 kg/m2. In addition, men participated independent protocol collected stored four prostate tissue cores time diagnostic prostate biopsy. Both dietary intervention biopsy tissue collection protocols approved Institutional Review Boards Veterans Administration, Puget Sound Health Care System Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, patients signed written informed con- sents. Study completed August 2003 November 2004. Randomization Dietary Intervention. Partici- pants randomly assigned one two groups: group I received instructions follow low-fat/low- glycemic load diet (<20% energy fat total daily glycemic load <100) group II instructed follow ‘‘standard American’’ diet (35% energy fat total daily glycemic load >200). A detailed descrip- tion intervention available authors upon request. In brief, participants provided dietary intervention manual focused meal planning. For individuals randomized low-fat/ low-glycemic load diet, study nutritionist provided detailed instructions worked participant plan least three meals. Participants randomized standard American group asked continue usual dietary habits, using lists prohibited permitted foods guideline food choices. During first week, nutritionist made five follow-up telephone calls review intervention materials provide additional meal planning support; calls made least per week thereafter. Dietary Anthropometric Assessment. Unsched- uled, telephone-administered 24-h dietary recalls completed week assess adherence study diet, using University Minnesota’s Nutrition Data Systems Research software (version 37, 2006). Interviewers blinded randomization assign- ment. On days randomization prostatectomy, participants weighed study staff beam balance scale. Height measured using standing stadiometer. Body mass index calculated weight (kg) / height (m)2. Clinical Specimens. At time biopsy acquiring 12 diagnostic prostate cores, obtained four additional tissue cores peripheral zone. At time radical prostatectomy, prostate exposed via midline incision, obtained four situ prostate biopsy cores using 18-gauge prostate needle biopsy gun (Bard Inc.). All biopsies collected peripheral zone immediately embedded frozen described below. Because study limited effects diet normal epithelium, attempted intraoperatively biopsy sites contain malignant epithelium, corresponding sites diagnostic biopsy specimens. The situ samples collected removing prostate previously found surgical manipulation caused artifactual changes gene expression (7). Specimen Handling Laser Capture Microdis- section. Biopsy cores embedded individually polyethylene glycol freezing media (Tissue-Tek OCT Compound, Sakura Finetek), placed isopentane precooled liquid nitrogen, stored  80jC (8). We used laser capture microdissection collect 5,000 epithelial cells histologically benign epithelial glands extracted RNA using standardized protocol (9). The RNA subjected linear amplification converted cDNA microarray hybridization previously described (7). Gene Expression Analysis Microarray Hybridiza- tion. We prepared hybridized spotted cDNA micro- arrays previously described (10), using RNA single batch reference standards hybridiza- tion. Fluorescent array images collected Cy3 Cy5 using GenePix 4000B fluorescent scanner (Axon Instruments), GenePix Pro 4.1 software used grid extract image intensity data.

We confirmed microarray results quantitative reverse tran- scription-PCR found correlation 0.97. Discussion In small randomized clinical trial, showed feasibility studying dietary effects gene expression using preprostatectomy model. We collected pretreatment biopsies posttreatment situ biopsies, delivered effective dietary intervention within weeks diagnostic biopsy surgery. We also showed tissue single prostate biopsy core, weighing f3 5 mg, yielded adequate RNA, albeit single round amplification, multiple analyses, in- cluding cDNA microarrays quantitative reverse tran- scription-PCR. Lastly, found intraindividual variability gene expression tissues collected two time points sufficiently small allow detection intervention effects. Much larger sample sizes needed rigorously measure reliability transcript expres- sion prostate tissue collected different times, results encouraging future research examin- ing effects short-term interventions prostate tissue. The low-fat/low-glycemic load diet, associated weight loss, associated multiple gene expres- sion changes. Many changes could conceivably alter proliferation, metabolism, redox potential prostate epithelial cells. For example, insulin-like growth factor-I receptor binds insulin-like growth factor-I -II, role insulin-like growth factor-I recep- tor tumorigenesis proliferation well established (8). We emphasize, however, much larger samples would needed make strong biological inferences based gene expression arrays. The principal limitation study small sample size. We little power detect modest changes transcript expression. We also sampled f6,000 genes prostate tissue transcriptome, many additional genes evaluated could Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev 2007;16(10).

We also determined whether diet-associated changes transcript levels result corresponding alterations cognate proteins. Lastly, limited analyses epithelial compartment, prostate cancer arises epithelium, however, many interac- tions prostate stroma epithelium (12-14). In summary, conclude effect complex dietary changes gene expression evaluated within preprostatectomy model.

These ideal characteristics chemopreventive combination anti-cancer strategies, warranting substantial research effort harnessing biological activities agents disease prevention treatment. However, requires investigation mode action novel approaches development reliable biomarkers. Introduction Epidemiology indicates incidence many common cancers geographically environmentally determined diets rich fresh fruit vegetables confer lower risk developing tumours many target tissues. Around one third cancers thought related unhealthy diet therefore, theory, preventable [1]. However, linking particular dietary components prevention specific cancers proved major challenge. Many phytochemicals differing chemical structure anticarcinogenic properties. They activate cytoprotective enzymes inhibit DNA damage block initiation healthy cells, modulate cell signalling eliminate unhealthy cells later stages carcinogenic process. In vitro data several well-studied compounds indicate affect many aspects cell biochemistry, different agents many similar activities (Table 1). Nevertheless effects cell-type specific, transformed cells particularly sensitive. But despite exponential increase knowledge regarding mechanisms action molecules, success clinical trials limited. In addition difficulties long-term prevention trials healthy populations, reasons this. In cancer therapeutics, emphasis increasingly placed targeting tumour subtypes within particular tissue, generally considered chemopreventive trials. In many instances crucial vivo targets particular dietary molecules unknown, making difficult predict cancer phenotypes likely affected. Many phytochemicals poorly bioavailable evidence suggests combinations may effective single agents. There may also advantages combining chemo- radio-therapies. Probably greatest hindrance successful trials lack validated biomarkers efficacy. To enable many agents tested much quickly, validated surrogate endpoint biomarkers 2 required, accurately determine outcome much earlier time process tumour development. Identifying risk individuals In order optimise chances success cancer chemoprevention trials, ability identify individuals likely benefit clearly important [2]. In case primary prevention inhibit earliest stages tumour development, selection traditionally based known environmental lifestyle risk factors, genetic predisposition family history. But cohorts, obtaining definitive evidence directly link exposure particular dietary agent prevention cancer target tissue best extremely challenging, worst impossible. In future possible individuals suitable primary prevention identified screening common multiple susceptibility loci, recently reported breast cancer [3]. Such loci together could inform substantial fraction genetic variance cancers. Patients recruited later stages carcinogenic process. Secondary prevention appropriate already developed premalignant lesions, intraepithelial neoplasia intestinal polyps, progress monitored response chemopreventive treatments. Several dietary compounds, including indoles polyphenols shown promise respect, regression respiratory papillomatosis, cervical, vulvar prostate intraepithelial neoplasia oral leukoplakia [4-7]. However, relationship early lesions tumour outcome uncertain. Clearly strategy involving susceptibility loci would also relevant stage, adding degree certainty prognosis. A third strategy tertiary prevention, focuses patients successfully treated primary tumour, order inhibit development second primary tumours. Greatest success date respect resulted use drugs tamoxifen analogues breast cancer, retinoids skin, head neck liver cancer [8]. If phytochemicals role stage, likely part combined therapy. Arguably fourth category patients could benefit would superficial primary tumour, intervention designed prevent invasion metastases. While cellular process epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) fundamental morphogenesis, reactivated cancer, facilitates invasion metastasis[9]. Reversing process could limit metastatic spread, achieving late-stage prevention 3 enhanced survival. Ability chemopreventive agents inhibit EMT angiogenesis demonstrated number animal models. Use phytochemicals purpose would facilitated knowledge characteristics within primary tumour predict invasive potential. We previously showed polyphenol, curcumin, modifies invasive potential breast cancer cells[10]. Another polyphenol, epigallocatechin-3- gallate (EGCG), found inhibit neovascularisation chick chorioallantoic membrane assay given drinking water could significantly suppress vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-induced corneal neovascularisation [11]. Such results suggest EGCG may useful inhibitor angiogenesis vivo. A number phytochemicals also affect expression cadherins, catenins matrix metalloproteinases (Table 1), prognostic metastatic biomarkers breast cancer, urokinase plasminogen activator, uPA/PAI1 Her2 [12] modulate invasive capacity. Tumour subtypes A key aspect targeted therapies, far received much less attention chemoprevention trials, concept tumour subtypes. Tumour development involves accumulation multiple mutations differ one tumour next target tissue. Such changes assessed using gene expression profiles identify patterns pathway deregulation inform disease prognosis indicate treatment options [13]. Subtypes perhaps best defined leukaemias [reviewed 14] breast cancer, least 5 subtypes including luminal A (oestrogen receptor α (ERα)- positive), luminal B (ERα-positive), basal-like (ERα-negative, Her2-negative, cytokeratin 5/6-positive, and/or epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)/Her1-positive), Her2 (Her2 amplicon-positive, ER-negative) normal breast-like identified [15,16]. Such patterns cancer cell lines also shown useful predicting response therapeutic agents [13, 17,18]. However, subtypes identified basis gene expression profiles correspond exactly identified immunohistochemistry [19,20] used clinical practice [21]. Additionally, gene signatures predict response individual agents used combination Dietary chemopreventive agents certainly exhibit cell-type specificity, broad ranging activity, may effective different tumour subtypes. Recent studies show indole-3-carbinol (I3C) induces apoptosis decreasing expression efficacy multidrug regimes [22]. predict 4 genes essential tumour cell viability, ERα EGFR breast cells luminal A basal-like subtypes [23,24] Molecular biomarkers There doubt identification reliable molecular markers, subtype molecular signatures, would extremely advantageous accurately predict efficacy intervention. Ideal markers indicative early changes, relate directly carcinogenic process possible allow invasive assessment chemopreventive efficacy [25]. For approaches, requires detailed knowledge stages carcinogenesis particular tumour subtype, also mechanisms action preventive agent. Molecular biomarkers would valuable targets identify new agents optimise lead compounds; risk biomarkers selecting suitable cohorts chemopreventive trials; indicators efficacy determining response mechanism-based interventions identifying potential toxicity. There shortage candidate proteins related oncogenic processes (drug metabolising enzymes, growth factors, transcription factors, cell cycle apoptosis related proteins) known aberrantly expressed various tumours modulated phytochemicals vitro (Table 1). The philosophy chemoprevention suggests long-term life-time exposure low doses. Therefore, selecting potential biomarkers efficacy, essential ensure modulated appropriate conditions. However, many vitro mechanistic studies carried single high doses chemopreventive agent achievable vivo. Thus reported effects may physiologically relevant. In order better predict phytochemicals may act Pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic studies allow estimates plasma and, cases tissue, concentrations made. Where already exist, indicate achievable concentrations nanomolar, best, low micromolar range. In humans curcumin levels typically low nanomolar range, although ~10 μM achieved colorectal tissue. Resveratrol plasma concentrations ~2μM appear typical [reviewed 26]. These low doses need applied cell culture studies extended periods better mimic vivo exposure. We exposed metastatic breast line, MDA-MB231, physiologically achievable concentrations five agents long-term culture observed favourable alterations cell cycle, clonogenicity, apoptosis expression several proteins associated EMT (Moiseeva et al unpublished data). Encouragingly, quite humans, several approaches less required. 5 published studies, single treatments physiological concentrations dietary agents used vitro, also reveal significant biological activity [reviewed 26]. Additionally number phytochemical effects observed vitro validated animal models. Monolayer cultures unrepresentative vivo environments, models cells grown relevant substrata like collagen, laminin matrigel, 3- dimensional spheroids may compatible vivo activity. We found breast cells responded differently I3C growing conditions [27]. In 3D culture (collagen 1 spheroids) sensitivity MCF7 MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells towards I3C increased. In MDA-MB-468 cells expression EGFR β1- integrin modulated 3D culture, cells responding differently EGF EGFR inhibitor, PD153035. Phytochemical effects often cell-type specific different panels biomarkers may required different target tissues, different cancer subtypes within single tissue. On hand appears certain degree similarity protein targets affected variety structurally unrelated phytochemicals, suggesting similar mechanisms action (Table 1). A detailed understanding effects dietary agents (for example growth factor signalling, EMT, cell cycle arrest apoptosis) following extended treatment physiologically achievable doses, related target tissue cancer subtype, help identify useful biomarkers. Such understanding would include identification primary targets phytochemicals (particular proteins receptors, general effects endoplasmic reticulum stress altered redox status), appreciation healthy cells generally resistant comparison vitro vivo efficacy. Cancer-initiating stem cells An increasing number studies reporting identification subset cancer stem cells within tumour, thought responsible highly aggressive nature different cancers. Breast cancer cells, grown immune compromised mice, contained subpopulation antigen (ESA)+CD44+CD24-/lowLineage-]. This subset maintained ability form new tumours [28 Al-Hajj]. Interestingly, basal-like breast cancer subtype similarity breast stem cells [20, 29], suggesting “stem-like” characteristics subtype may responsible aggressiveness poor prognosis. Using xenograft model primary human pancreatic adenocarcinoma, Li et al [30] described subpopulation cancer cells surface markers expressing cell [epithelial specific 6 [expressing CD44, CD24 ESA] 100-fold tumorigenic cells tumours. Similarly O’Brien et al., [31] identified highly tumorigenic subset colon cancer cells positive CD133 (1 colon cancer initiating cell per 5.7 x 104 tumour cells). Clearly biomarkers used reliably identify subsets cancer initiating cells, essential determine efficacy treatments these, preference phenotypes within tumour. Dietary agents combined treatments Also increasing importance investigation combinations phytochemicals, use conjunction therapies, increase efficacy decrease unwanted side effects [26, 32]. We shown breast cell lines I3C exhibits enhanced efficacy combination src EGFR kinase inhibitors [24] vivo I3C prevented hepatotoxicity trabectidin (ET743), experimental anti-tumour drug promising activity sarcoma, breast ovarian carcinomas, without compromising anti- tumour efficacy [33]. Curcumin enhances efficacy oxaliplatin p53-positive p53mutant colon cancer cells [34]. However, caution required, since also reported compromise efficacy chemotherapeutic drugs human breast cancer models [35]. Proteomics Methods require detailed knowledge mechanisms, initially least, offer alternative approach developing biomarkers assessing chemopreventive efficacy. Mass spectrometry biological samples offers powerful proteomic tool discovery novel biomarkers profiling [36]. Proteins peptides clinical samples reflect intracellular activities healthy diseased tissue. Plasma samples subjected mass spectrometry provide characteristic protein profiles, over- under-expressed peptides determined pattern comparison using variety machine learning algorithms [37-39]. This technique offer possibility monitoring plasma profiles risk individuals response particular treatment regime. Development methods cultured cells, would also provide means screen effects chemopreventive agents – example, estimate lowest concentration agent causes change profile; look dose-response altered peaks; compare effects one agent different cell types; compare signatures compounds cell type; enable identification signature peaks. Individual proteins identified correlating sequences tryptic peptides generated tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) sequences protein databases. 7 The evolutionary algorithms support vector machine (SVM) supervised learning enable identification biomarkers highest diagnostic prognostic potential. The effectiveness combined treatments could also explored. Nuclear fractions could provide enrichment investigating changes transcription factors cell cycle-related proteins. In view importance protein phosphorylation proliferation, differentiation apoptosis, development techniques selective phosphopeptides would provide added value [40, 41]. Conclusions In order fully appreciate potential dietary compounds cancer prevention bridge gap apparent vitro efficacy clinical use, number approaches required. Attention must paid use physiologically relevant concentrations, chronic exposure 3D cultures, accurately mimic vivo situations. Validation potential mechanisms appropriate animal models also important. The mechanistic biomarkers identified vitro need verified human tissues central carcinogenic process. Finally genomics proteomics approaches offer novel ways predicting clinical efficacy. Acknowledgements The authors grateful Professor Peter Farmer Dr Don Jones critical discussion. References 1.

Sims,1 Michelle Harvie,2 Mary Chapman,2 Warwick B. Dunn,3 David Broadhurst,4 Royston Goodacre,4 Mary Wilson,2 Nicola Thomas,2 Robert B. Clarke1 Anthony Howell2,5 Abstract Dietary energy restriction (DER) reduces risk spontaneous mammary cancer rodents. In humans, DER premenopausal years seems reduce risk postmenopausal breast cancer. Markers DER required develop acceptable DER regimens breast cancer prevention. We therefore examined markers DER breast, adipose tissue, serum. Nineteen overweight obese women moderately increased risk breast cancer (life- time risk, 1 6 1 3) ages 35 45 randomly allocated DER [liquid diet, 3,656 kJ/d (864 kcal/d); = 10] asked continue normal eating patterns (n = 9) one menstrual cycle. Biopsies breast abdominal fat taken intervention. RNA extracted whole tissues breast epithelium (by laser capture microdissection) hybridized Affymetrix GeneChips. Longitudinal plasma urine samples collected intervention, metabolic profiles gen- erated using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. DER associated significant reductions weight [−7.0 (±2.3) kg] alterations serum biomarkers breast cancer risk (insulin, leptin, total low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides). In abdominal breast tissues, well isolated breast epithelial cells, genes involved glycolytic lipid synthesis pathways (including stearoyl-CoA desaturase, fatty acid desaturase, aldolase C) significantly down- regulated. We conclude reduced expressions genes lipid metabolism glycolytic pathways detectable breast tissue following DER, may represent targets DER mimetics effective chemoprophylactic agents. Dietary energy restriction (DER) significantly reduces sponta- neous mammary tumors laboratory rodents irrespective type macronutrient restricted (1).

To maximize compliance standardize die- tary change, DER comprised liquid meal replacement drink (Slimfast). The declines body fat (−4.6 kg 26 days) among DER group consistent ∼1,400 kcal/d energy deficit, indicating good compliance DER regimen (47). The clear effect DER body weight, fat, lipids leptin confirms compliance sufficient level metabolic effects reflects suc- cess rigorous selection process. DER well known cause declines leptin (15) SHBG (48). The decline total low-density lipoprotein cholesterol triglycer- ides consistent previous studies low-fat, energy- restricted regimens (49, 50). The DER regimen used study reduced energy in- take (67%) also resulted differential reduction macronutrients woman's standard diet calories carbohydrate (53% reduced), protein (43% reduced), fat (89% reduced). It possible changes seen study due altered composition diet, specifically greatly decreased fat intake.

A higher FDR (0.3) used identify consistent- ly changed genes breast tissue following DER compared adipose tissue (0.01). We postulated due greater heterogeneity breast tissue compared abdominal adipose. Alternatively, could indication response DER breast tissue simply var- iable response adipose tissue. Although P va- lues shown Table 2 low breast tissue adipose tissue, still highly significant. Furthermore, gene ontology analysis identified many pathways tissues almost genes within down-regulated (Supplementary Fig. S1). It would interesting compare gene expression breast adipo- cytes, epithelium, stroma separately; however, ap- proach would result much lower tissue RNA yield therefore necessitate invasive biopsy technique. However, able laser capture microdissection sufficient epithelium three DER samples obtain RNA analyze gene expression. This revealed similar changes genes, SCD, seen whole tissue, suggesting DER affect breast epithelial gene expression. Previous studies examined effect DER s.c. abdominal fat. Our findings largely concordant human studies. Notably, fatty acid synthesis genes down-regulated adipose tissue study (60% DER 1 month) previous Affymetrix array–based study Dahlman et al.

A recent study reported ep- ithelial cells chemical-induced mammary adenocarcino- mas Sprague-Dawley rats increased expression genes glycolysis, decreased pyruvate dehydrogenase, increased lactate dehydrogenase compared normal epi- thelial cells, consistent Warburg effect (54). Howev- er, pattern gene expression influenced 40% DER. The design study enable ef- fects DER spontaneous development breast cancer determined; furthermore, changes lipid metabolism reported (55). Adipocytes breast epithelial cells lie close proximity breast tissue. Large adipocytes obese subjects may dysregulated secre- tion factors (i.e., increased leptin decreased adiponec- tin), may promote proliferation transformed ductal carcinoma cells (56). DER resulted significant re- ductions serum levels leptin (66%) change serum adiponectin. Serum changes leptin re- flected leptin gene expression. The dissociation adipokine gene expression serum levels noted Tissue Biomarkers Energy Restriction earlier studies, suggesting lack sensitivity post- translational effects DER (57). There meta- bolomic studies DER humans. We detect significant changes glycolysis (glucose-6-phosphate pyruvate) tricarboxylic acid cycle metabolites (succinic acid 2-oxoglutaric acid) despite pathways down-regulated gene expression level. However, small sample sizes would preclude detection small dif- ferences concentrations metabolites. The exact mechanism protective effect DER cancer remains unknown. Increased glycolysis fatty acid synthesis well described tumors, renewed interest inhibition pathways cancer treatment also prevention cancer diseases (see ref. 9 review). For example, inhibition glycolysis two deoxyglucose fatty acid synthases compound named C75 inhibits tumor growth rodent human models (58, 59), whereas indirect obser- vational evidence (increased stearic oleic acid ratio RBCs) consistent SCD activity linked breast cancer risk (45). This short-term study, difficult draw firm conclusions effects long-term DER. It un- known changes persist long-term finally desirable weight achieved weight stabilizes. In com- mon study, previous reports assessed changes gene expression energy restriction dynamic phase weight loss (16, 53). One report finds changes observed dynamic phase weight loss reversed attenuated 5-week weight sta- bilization phase (18). The beneficial changes gene expres- sion seen weight loss therefore mostly linked energy restriction. Periods intermittent restriction may thus required maintain beneficial effects (10). En- ergy restriction known reduce cell proliferation increase apoptotic rate normal tissues cancers (60–63). The inhibition glycolysis shown im- pair growth tumor cells (64, 65), suppression glycolysis fatty acid synthesis specifically breast epithelium may prevent breast carcinomas developing progressing. In summary, done first DER study character- ize gene expression changes premenopausal normal human breast tissue. Common differentially expressed genes pathways breast abdominal tissue suggests short-term energy restriction may influence breast cancer risk molecular level.

Of environ- mental factors affect prostate cancer development, diet identiﬁed important inﬂuence (5,6). Therefore, incor- porating foods diet known chemopreven- tive properties could reduce cancer incidence subsequently cancer-related deaths. Several mushroom species Ganoderma lucidum, Lentinus edodes, Grifola frondosa Agaricus blazei shown exhibit anticancer effects inhibition cell proliferation prostate (7,8), colon (9–11), breast can- cer cell lines (10,12). Mechanisms attributed anticancer activity mushrooms include induction apoptosis; inhibition angiogenesis prosurvival signaling pathways protein kinase B (AKT), extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK), nuclear factor kappa-B (NF6-B) activating protein-1 (AP-1) (7,13,14) modulation cell cycle control protein retinoblastoma (pRb) (8). Although much study completed medicinal varieties mushroom mentioned above, studies anticancer effects com- mon white button mushroom (Agaricus bisporus) limited. Much research focused anticancer effects carbohydrate fractions species. For example, lectins isolated white button mushroom shown increase sensitivity lung, colon, glioblastoma cancer cells chemotherapeutic drugs (15), inhibit colon cancer cell proliferation (16), enhance cellular antioxidant defense mechanisms (17). Previous studies laboratory investigated antiaro- matase activity common vegetables may suppress breast cancer cell proliferation. Of 7 vegetable extracts tested, extract white button mushrooms effective in- hibitor human placental aromatase activity (18). Our labora- tory focused ethyl acetate extract white button mushroom, contains mainly C-18 fatty acids simple organic phenolic acids (19). We previously reported extract effectively decreased proliferation breast cancer cells inhibition aromatase enzyme activity. 744 WHITE BUTTON MUSHROOMS AND PROSTATE TUMOR GROWTH 745 We also identiﬁed CLA major component mushroom extract also active inhibitor breast cancer cell prolif- eration aromatase activity (18,19). To determine anticancer potential mushroom extract prostate cancer cell lines, current study investigated vitro effects extract androgen sensitive LNCaP androgen insensitive PC3 DU145 prostate cancer cell lines. We also studied vivo chemopreventive potential mush- room extract two separate studies utilizing male athymic mice injected either DU145 PC3 prostate cancer cell lines. The information gained study gives us future direc- tion investigation active ingredients mushrooms well mechanisms overall understanding inclusion mushrooms diet may contribute effective prostate cancer prevention strategies.

Induction Apoptosis Mushroom Extract To determine whether observed decrease cell num- ber treatment mushroom extract due in- duction apoptosis, formation mononucleosomes oligonucleosomes quantiﬁed using Cell Death Detection ELISAPLUS assay (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) Annexin V/PI staining. Following treatment mushroom extract (20µl/ml) 48 h, signiﬁcant twofold increase DNA fragmentation detected LNCaP cells (P ≤ 0.01) com- pared untreated controls (Fig. 2A). The PC3 DU145 cell lines showed increase production mononucleosomes oligonucleosomes mushroom treatment compared untreated controls 48 h (Fig. 2A). However, 72 h treatment, mushroom extract signiﬁcantly induced DNA frag- mentation 4.4-fold PC3 cells (P ≤ 0.001) 1.8-fold DU145 cells (P ≤ 0.001; Fig. 2B).

As such, PS detection intact cells (PI negative cells) represent early stage apoptosis cell lines tested following exposure mushroom extract. In LNCaP cells, Annexin V positive cells increased 4.4-fold mushroom treatment 48 h compared untreated controls (P = 0.025). In PC3 cells treated mushroom extract, Annexin V staining increased threefold (P ≤ 0.01), whereas DU145 cells exhibited 1.4-fold increase compared untreated controls (Fig. 3A). After 72 h treatment mushroom extract, PC3 cells twofold increase Annexin V staining (P ≤ 0.02), whereas DU145 cells 1.6-fold increase Annexin V staining (P ≤ 0.02; Fig. 3B).

Inhibition Tumor Growth In Vivo To evaluate prostate cancer protective effects white button mushroom vivo, laboratory investigated ability mushroom extract inhibit PC3 DU145-derived tu- mor growth male, athymic (nu/nu) mice. The results animal experiments showed oral intake mushroom extract signiﬁcantly decreased DU145 tumor weight 44.5% (P ≤ 0.05) (Fig. 4A) PC3 tumor weight 68.6% (P ≤ 0.01; Fig. 5A) compared pair-fed control mice.

Histolog- ical examination DU145 tumors revealed cell prolifera- tion signiﬁcantly decreased 25.3% mushroom group compared controls (P ≤ 0.05; Fig. 4B), whereas level apoptosis tumors control mushroom extract-fed animals increased, although observation Through GC analysis, previously identiﬁed conjugated linoleic acid isomer 9Z, 11E major component 6X mushroom fraction (an average 45.7% total extract). We also showed 9Z, 11E CLA alone inhibits breast cancer cell proliferation inhibition activity aro- matase enzyme (19). Therefore, tested ability two common isoforms CLA (9Z, 11E 10E, 12Z) inhibit prostate cancer cell proliferation. The results indicate isoforms CLA signiﬁcantly inhibited prostate cancer cell pro- liferation dose dependent manner (9Z, 11E P value ≤0.01 10E, 12Z P value ≤0.05; Figs. 6A–6F), sug- gesting CLA may one major active components mushroom extract. However, natural products, gener- ally accepted overall combination components potent one component singled out. Further, possible one minor components could active CLA; however, breast cancer studies, ethyl acetate fraction potent fraction, major constituent found CLA.

DISCUSSION The aim research test anticancer activity phytochemicals common white button mushroom (Agaricus bisporus) prostate cancer vitro vivo. Our results show mushroom extract decreased prolif- eration prostate cancer cell lines dose-dependent manner compared untreated control cells. It important note mushroom extract similar antiproliferative effect three cell lines despite differing status regard androgen responsiveness. Therefore, conclude antiproliferative action mushroom extract mediated androgen-independent mechanism. As seen Figs. 2 3, differing levels sensitivity apoptosis induced mushroom extract exist three cell lines, LNCaP sensitive, PC3 less sensitive, DU145 least responsive proapoptotic effects mushroom extract. A similar result seen study utilizing extract Phellinus linteus (PL) mushroom LNCaP cells underwent apoptosis larger degree PC3 cells treatment PL. This study showed caspase 2 expression upregulated LNCaP cells PC3 cells, inhibition caspase 2 abolished proapoptotic effect PL LNCaP cells. The proapoptotic proteins caspase 8, caspase 3, BID activated equally LNCaP PC3 cells (20), suggesting although apoptosis may induced along similar pathways DU-45, PC3, LNCaP prostate cancer cell lines, modulation additional pathways androgen 750 L.

Future studies done determine mechanisms behind differing response cell line. Our vivo studies illustrated oral intake mushroom extract suppresses growth androgen-independent prostate tumors mice. This shows phytochemicals present mushroom active oral ingestion. Further, suppres- sion growth due inhibition cell proliferation mea- sured Ki-67 antibody staining, induction apoptosis observed. This result agreement vitro results. Our previous study (19) show apoptosis mechanism mushroom extract breast cancer cells lines tumors, whereas current study prostate cancer, apoptosis observed prostate cell lines. It well known distinct cell lines within cancer family respond differently treatment (as seen current study); therefore, reasonable expect results two different cancer types could also dissimilar. Results microarray analysis suggest several mecha- nisms effect mushroom prostate cancer cell prolif- eration apoptosis. Although expression many genes affected, two genes primary interest FAS/APO-1 KIT. FAS/APO-1 member tumor necrosis fac- tor receptor superfamily. This receptor contains death do- main plays central role physiological regulation programmed cell death (apoptosis). This gene upregulated 2.84-fold tumors mushroom group compared pair- fed controls (P = 0.035). KIT encodes human homolog proto-oncogene c-kit, protein product plays role proliferation survival cell. KIT gene expres- sion downregulated fourfold tumors mushroom group compared pair-fed controls (P = 0.043).

Microarray analysis results also indicate net effect mushroom extract lipid metabolism tumor tissues could result decrease diacylglycerol (DAG) prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production/release increasing ceramide arachidonic acid release. Both ceramide arachidonic acid involved proapoptotic signaling (21–23) cancer cells. DAG production leads activation PKC subsequent in- hibition ceramide-mediated apoptosis (24). Therefore, mush- room could also increase apoptosis increased produc- tion arachidonic acid (an eicosanoid) ceramide, facilitated inhibition DAG production. Additionally, study Ochoa et al. (25) found 9Z, 11E isomer CLA, found prominent mushroom extract, signiﬁcant effects cell proliferation apoptosis modulation eicosanoid biosynthesis PC3 prostate cancer cells. Speciﬁcally, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) protein expres- sion 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) mRNA expression decreased cells treated 9Z, 11E CLA, suggesting modulation eicosanoid biosynthesis may one mechanism CLA inhibits prostate cell proliferation (25). This data agreement observed effects current study CLA-rich mushroom extract prostate cancer cells. Arachidonic acid converted PGE2 (COX- 2) pathway, PGE2 production commonly increased tumor tissues. PGE2 shown promote 752 L. S. ADAMS ET AL. downregulated threefold (P = 0.017), whereas FH expression upregulated 4.3-fold (P = 0.009) mushroom-treated group compared pair-fed controls. This interest due unique nature normal prostate epithelial cells secrete citrate rather utilize TCA cycle produc- tion ATP. Prostate cancer cells, however, alter balance upregulating citric acid cycle produce energy increased ATP production (27). Therefore, mushroom extract may normalize TCA cycle prostate cancer cells downregulation isocitrate dehydrogenase expression. Citrate converted acetyl co-A, instrumental compo- nent fatty acid synthesis, leading back above-mentioned effects mushroom treatment process. With regard FH, expression enzyme upreg- ulated mushroom-treated mice, showing citric acid cycle entirely inhibited; therefore, fumarate still produced need conversion malate. Fumarate shown activate angiogenic factor HIF1α, therefore augmenting cancer’s ability sustain spread increasing blood supply (27). Upregulation FH expres- sion mushrooms would inhibit fumarate buildup cell downregulate angiogenic response. Additionally, en- dothelin 1, gene commonly upregulated hypoxia (28), downregulated threefold tumor specimens mushroom-treated mice. Therefore, analysis microarray data, hypothesize mush- room decreased tumor size, tumor cell proliferation, in- creased tumor cell apoptosis effects TCA cycle fatty acid metabolism. Future studies address hypothesis. Several studies demonstrated several mushroom species enhance immunity activation natural killer (NK) cells (29) modulation lymphocyte number activity (30). Studies also shown mushroom treatment induce Type 1 Type 2 immune response (31). Evasion immune response one way tumor cells survive; therefore, effect mushroom expression genes important immune function, seen microarray analysis (Table 2), another mechanism could contribute anticancer action vivo. Identiﬁcation phytochemicals present mushroom extract important understanding mode action could facilitate future studies enabling use puriﬁed compounds extract. Similar previous ﬁnd- ings breast cancer, current study showed CLA in- hibited proliferation prostate cancer cell lines. Much research published illustrating antiproliferative (25,32,33) proapoptotic (34–36) activity CLA. CLA also shown signiﬁcant effects immune system increased T-cell responsiveness splenocyte IL-2 production mice fed 1% CLA diet (37). Thus, presence compound white button mushrooms likely signiﬁcantly adds biological activity whole extract. FIG. 7.

ORIGINAL INVESTIGATION Meat Intake Mortality A Prospective Study Over Half Million People Rashmi Sinha, PhD; Amanda J. Cross, PhD; Barry I. Graubard, PhD; Michael F. Leitzmann, MD, DrPH; Arthur Schatzkin, MD, DrPH Background: High intakes red processed meat may increase risk mortality. Our objective de- termine relations red, white, processed meat intakes risk total cause-specific mortality. Methods: The study population included National Institutes Health–AARP (formerly known Ameri- Association Retired Persons) Diet Health Study cohort half million people aged 50 71 years base- line. Meat intake estimated food frequency questionnaire administered baseline. Cox propor- tional hazards regression models estimated hazard ra- tios (HRs) 95% confidence intervals (CIs) within quintiles meat intake. The covariates included models age, education, marital status, family his- tory cancer (yes/no) (cancer mortality only), race, body mass index, 31-level smoking history, physical activity, energy intake, alcohol intake, vitamin supplement use, fruit consumption, vegetable consumption, meno- pausal hormone therapy among women. Main outcome measures included total mortality deaths due can- cer, cardiovascular disease, injuries sudden deaths, causes. highest vs lowest quintile red (HR, 1.31 [95% CI, 1.27-1.35], HR, 1.36 [95% CI, 1.30-1.43], re- spectively) processed meat (HR, 1.16 [95% CI, 1.12- 1.20], HR, 1.25 [95% CI, 1.20-1.31], respectively) intakes elevated risks overall mortality. Regard- ing cause-specific mortality, men women el- evated risks cancer mortality red (HR, 1.22 [95% CI, 1.16-1.29], HR, 1.20 [95% CI, 1.12-1.30], re- spectively) processed meat (HR, 1.12 [95% CI, 1.06- 1.19], HR, 1.11 [95% CI 1.04-1.19], respectively) in- takes. Furthermore, cardiovascular disease risk elevated men women highest quintile red (HR, 1.27 [95% CI, 1.20-1.35], HR, 1.50 [95% CI, 1.37-1.65], respectively) processed meat (HR, 1.09 [95% CI, 1.03-1.15], HR, 1.38 [95% CI, 1.26-1.51], respectively) intakes.

Completion baseline ques- tionnaire considered imply informed consent. DIETARY ASSESSMENT A 124-item food frequency questionnaire (http://riskfactor .cancer.gov/DHQ/forms/files/shared/dhq1.2002.sample.pdf) completed baseline. The food frequency questionnaire col- lected information usual consumption foods drinks portion sizes last 12 months. The validity food frequency questionnaire estimated using two 24- hour recalls,8 estimated energy-adjusted correlations ranged 0.36 0.76 various nutrients attenuation factors ranged 0.24 0.68. Red meat intake calcu- lated using frequency consumption portion size in- formation types beef pork included bacon, beef, cold cuts, ham, hamburger, hotdogs, liver, pork, sausage, steak, meats foods pizza, chili, lasagna, stew. White meat included chicken, turkey, fish included poultry cold cuts, chicken mixtures, canned tuna, low-fat sau- sages low-fat hotdogs made poultry. Processed meat included bacon, red meat sausage, poultry sausage, luncheon meats (red white meat), cold cuts (red white meat), ham, regular hotdogs low-fat hotdogs made poultry. The components constituting red white processed meats overlap include meats bacon, sau- sage, ham, processed meat also included smoked turkey chicken. However, meat groups used models; thus, duplicated one analysis. To investigate whether overall composition meat in- take associated mortality, created 3 diet types: high-, medium-, low-risk meat diet. To form diet variables, red white meat consumption energy adjusted split 2 groups using median values cut points. Individuals red meat consumption upper half white meat con- sumption lower half got score 1 (high-risk meat diet), red white meat consumption half got score 2 (medium-risk meat diet), red meat consumption lower half white meat consumption upper half got score 3 (low-risk meat diet).

A lag analysis, excluding deaths occurring first 2 years follow-up, produced results consistent main findings Table 2 Table 3. For example, HRs total mortality men red meat fol- lows: second quintile HR, 1.05 (95% CI, 1.01-1.09); third quintile HR, 1.13 (95% CI, 1.09-1.17); fourth quintile HR, 1.20 (95% CI, 1.16-1.24); fifth quintile HR, 1.30 (95% CI, 1.26-1.35). For women, HRs fol- lows: second quintile HR, 1.07 (95% CI, 1.02-1.12); third quintile HR, 1.15 (95% CI, 1.11-1.21); fourth quintile HR, 1.27 (95% CI, 1.21-1.33); fifth quintile HR, 1.35 (95% CI, 1.28-1.42). Furthermore, investigated models violation proportional hazard as- sumption. Proportional hazard assumption re- jected analyses except one, model red white meat among women total mortality (P=.008). On examination model relative HR first 5 years follow-up second 5 years follow-up, red meat results consistent 2 follow-up periods. However, white meat, second 5-year period showed less inverse trend compared first 5-year period (data shown).

CELL PROLIFERATION One hallmarks cancer aggressive prolif- eration cells. In normal cells, proliferation reﬂects ﬁnely controlled balance growth-promoting growth-inhibiting signals. However, cancer cells often acquire capability generating growth signals, also becoming insensitive growth-suppressing signals.15 Several proteins rec- ognized critical cell cycle regulation including cyclins, cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), CDK in- hibitors (CDKIs), regulatory proteins (retinoblastoma [Rb] p53), E2F transcription factor (Figure 1).

Combinations dietary components, rather individual agents, offer exciting opportunity maximizing response.

APOPTOSIS Apoptosis, interchangeably referred pro- grammed cell death, key pathway regulating homeostasis. In Greek apoptosis literally means “falling away.” It natural, organized process accounts approximately 3 billion cell deaths human body every minute. It helps maintain natural balance cell death cell renewal destroying excess, damaged, abnormal cells. Apoptosis one potent defenses cancer since process eliminates potentially deleterious, mutated cells. Triggers apoptosis induction include DNA damage, disruption cell cycle, hypoxia, detach- ment cells surrounding tissue, loss trophic signaling.60 It characterized cell shrinkage, chromatin condensation, fragmentation cell compact membrane-enclosed structures, called “apoptotic bodies” engulfed macrophges removed tissue controlled manner.61 These morphological changes result character- istic molecular biochemical events occurring cell, notably activation proteolytic en- zymes.

In addition, mitogenic stress re- sponse pathways involved regulation apoptotic signaling. Compelling evidence exists bioactive dietary components trigger apoptosis though numerous intracellular molecular targets apoptotic path- ways vitro (Figure 2, Tables 2 3). Distinct apoptotic events normal physiological pro- cess, mediated mainly interaction death receptors relevant ligands,79 many bioactive dietary components appear induce apoptosis mitochondria mediated pathway activating p53 target genes. For example, EGCG induces expression p53 target BAX prostate cancer cells wild-type p53 inactive p53.80 Similarly, resveratrol induces apoptosis cells expressing wild-type p53 p53- deﬁcient cells.81 Many dietary compounds induce oxidative stress, downregulates anti-apoptotic molecules Bcl-2 Bcl-x upregulates pro- apoptotic molecules Bax Bak.82 Many dietary agents appear exhibit degree speciﬁcity neoplastic cells, sparing normal cells. For example, 25 50 ␮mol/L quercetin signiﬁ- cantly inhibited growth highly aggressive PC-3 moderately aggressive DU-145 prostate cancer cell lines affect less aggressive LNCaP cells normal ﬁbrobasts.83 The concentration tested cell culture studies de- termines whether agent functioning nutritionally pharmacologically. For example, concentrations EGCG needed signiﬁcantly downregulate anti- apoptotic proteins induce programmed cell death vitro (20 ␮mol/L) considerably greater physiological concentrations could obtained typical tea consumption.84 Consumption 6 7 cups green tea per day (⬃30 mg/kg/d EGCG) would generate plasma EGCG concentration 1 ␮mol/L.84 However, achieve higher plasma concen- trations, EGCG supplements needed.85 In contrast, humans, consumption onions applesauce peel resulted peak plasma concentrations quercetin 225 ⫾ 43 331⫾7 ␮mol/L, respec- tively,86 signiﬁcantly greater concen- trations needed induce apoptosis vitro (30 –100 ␮mol/L).87 Another important consideration combining dietary components may promote additive syner- gistic effects apoptosis induction. For example, res- veratrol quercetin combinations additively acti- vated caspase-3 cytochrome c release human pancreatic cell line.88 Also, quercetin ellagic acid (at 5 10 ␮mol/L each), work synergistically induce apoptotis human leukemia MOLT-4 cells.89 Selenium vitamin E yet another example synergistic beneﬁts combining food components induction apoptosis human prostate cancer cells.90 This synergy accounted primarily selenium vitamin E modifying distinct signaling pathways caspase activation.

Decreased Growth Human Prostate LNCaP Tumors SCID Mice Fed Low-Fat, Soy Protein Diet With Isoflavones William J. Aronson, Christopher N. Tymchuk, Robert M. Elashoff, William H. McBride, Colin McLean, Hejing Wang, David Heber Abstract: Epidemiological studies suggest high intake dietary fat risk factor development clinical prostate cancer. Soy protein also proposed play role prevention prostate cancer, one isoflavones soy protein, genistein, inhibits growth human prostate cancer cell lines vitro. This study de- signed evaluate whether altering dietary fat, soy protein, isoflavone content affects growth rate human androgen-sensitive prostate cancer cell line (LNCaP) grown severe-combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice. SCID mice randomized four dietary groups: high-fat (42.0 kcal%) + casein, high-fat (42.0 kcal%) + soy protein + isoflavone extract, low-fat (12.0 kcal%) + casein, low-fat (12.0 kcal%) + soy protein + isoflavone extract. After two weeks diets, mice injected subcutaneously 1 ´ 105 LNCaP tumor cells placed separate cages (1 mouse/cage) strictly control caloric intake. Isocaloric di- ets given 3 days/wk, tumor sizes measured per week. The tumor growth rates slightly reduced group received low-fat + soy protein + isoflavone ex- tract diet compared groups combined (p < 0.05). In addition, final tumor weights reduced 15% group received low-fat + soy protein + isoflavone extract diet compared groups com- bined (p < 0.05). In xenograft model prostate cancer, statistically significant effects tumor growth rate final tumor weight attributable low-fat + soy protein + isoflavone extract diet. Introduction In United States, prostate cancer com- monly diagnosed cancer men well second lead- ing cause male cancer-related deaths (1). It estimated 1999 179,300 new prostate cancer cases 37,000 men die disease (1). Although la- tent clinically insignificant prostate cancer occurs large proportion equal rates autopsy studies among men Asian countries United States (approx 30% men >50 yr old), incidence clinically significant prostate cancer 15-fold higher United States (1–4). Furthermore, Chinese Japanese men immigrate country increased incidence mortality prostate cancer compared Chinese Japanese men native country (5–8). These epidemiological studies suggest environmental factors associated Western culture may promote development clinical prostate cancer. Two dietary factors implicated dietary fat soy protein. A number epidemiological studies shown positive association intake dietary fat incidence mortality prostate cancer (8–12). Furthermore, recent study Wang co-workers (13) showed androgen receptor-positive hu- man prostate cancer cells (LNCaP) greater tumor weights growth rates nude mice fed diet high polyunsaturated fat (40.5 kcal%) mice fed diets lower fat content (21.2, 11.6, 2.3 kcal%) (13). One major differences Asian Ameri- diets consumption soy-based foodstuffs. Cow- ard colleagues (14) reported average consumption soy protein Taiwan 35 g/day per capita (14). The beneficial effects soy attributed iso- flavones found highest content soy, e.g., genistein daidzein (15,16). Genistein daidzein, b-glucoside conjugates, present soybeans concen- trations 3 mg/g, average isoflavone intake Asian culture estimated 39 mg/day (17,18). The average American eats, most, milligrams isoflavones per day (15). The decrease prostate cancer mortality Japanese men compared United States may attributed, part, high soy pro- tein content Japanese diet (16).

Each mouse given subcutaneous inoculation 1 ´ 105 tumor cells lateral abdomen disposable syringe 26-gauge needle. An initial experiment 20 animals (5 dietary group) performed injecting 1 ´ 106 tumor cells 0.2 ml Matrigel per animal. When tumors animals reached 1.0–1.5 cm3, caused animals four di- etary groups become cachectic. This occurred ani- mals approximately seven weeks tumor inoculation. Therefore, 1 ´ 105 cells 0.2 ml Matrigel used subsequent experiments allow tumor growth longer time period evaluate effect diets. Two successive experiments performed: first five animals four dietary groups second six seven animals four dietary groups. The experiments run separately limited space resources SCID mouse facility accommodate one mouse per cage experimental design. The data experiments used statistical analysis. All animals randomly assigned one four dietary groups (high-fat + casein, high-fat + soy protein + isoflavones, low-fat + casein, low-fat + soy protein + isoflavones) maintained diet two weeks be- fore tumor cell injection. All animals kept isocaloric diet, described Feeding Protocol. Once tumors became palpable, dimensions recorded weekly Week 12 experiment. Animal weights also recorded weekly. The tumor volumes calcu- lated using following formula: length ´ width ´ height ´ 0.5236 (20). Thirteen weeks initiation experi- ment, mice sacrificed. Blood collected cen- trifuged, serum frozen -70°C. The tumors dissected, weighed, frozen liquid nitrogen. Determination Serum Prostate-Specific Antigen Testosterone Serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels deter- mined using enzyme immunoassay kit (American Qualex Antibodies, San Clemente, CA). Total serum testosterone determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (KMI Diagnostics, Minneapolis, MN). All assays performed duplicate. The interassay variability <5.0%. Statistical Analysis A linear regression model used test differences body weight, caloric intake, final tumor weight, PSA lev- els, testosterone levels among four diet groups. Be- cause study consisted two successive experiments, “experiment” also considered covariate and, together baseline body weight average weekly caloric in- take, included linear regression model. Baseline body weight average weekly caloric intake show significant association tumor weight PSA testosterone levels. Therefore, “experiment” covariate included final model. Growth rate as- sessed repeatedly measuring tumor volumes time. A random coefficient model developed correlate tumor volume, time (week), diet, covariates (experiment baseline body weight). Covariates show sig- nificant association tumor volume excluded model. Log-rank test used test time palpa- ble tumor among four diet groups. The analyses also carried comparing individual dietary group three dietary groups combined. Results Forty-three (94%) 46 mice developed measurable tumors: 10 (10/12) high-fat + casein group, 11 (11/11) high-fat + soy protein + isoflavone group, 12 (12/12) low-fat + casein group, 10 (10/11) low-fat + soy protein + isoflavone group. There significant dif- ference caloric intake among animals four groups (Figure 1). In addition, significant dif- ference body weights among groups (Figure 2). When final tumor weight tumor growth rate compared among four dietary groups, sig- nificant differences. However, final tumor weights mice fed low-fat + soy protein + isoflavone diet 15% less final tumor weights animals three groups combined (high-fat + casein, high-fat + soy protein + isoflavone, low-fat + casein) ( p = 0.0499, general linear model) (Table 2).

Discussion In study, evaluated effect dietary fat, soy protein, soy isoflavones growth human pros- tate cancer cells xenograft SCID mouse model. We found combining low-fat diet (12 kcal%) soy pro- tein (20 kcal%) isoflavones (0.18% weight) reduced tumor growth rate final tumor weights compared diets study. In prior study, Wang co-workers (13) showed sig- nificant reduction growth LNCaP tumors nude mice fed diets lower fat (21.2, 11.6, 2.3 kcal%) com- pared mice fed high-fat diet (40.5 kcal%). In study, trend toward decreased tumor weights low-fat + casein group compared high-fat + ca- sein group, although reach statistical signifi- cance. It may that, larger sample size, difference low-fat high-fat groups may reached statistical significance. An alternative explana- tion differences results study Wang co-workers may explained differences experimental designs. In study, one animal per cage design allowed isocaloric feeding protocol. In study Wang co-workers, multiple ani- mals per cage, therefore caloric intake strictly controlled monitored. It possible marked differ- Table 3.

An alternative explanation may relate animal model used. Whereas nude mice (used Wang co-workers) possess B cell immunity, SCID mice lack T cell, B cell, natural killer cell immunity. It may nutrition interacting immune system nude mouse cause dramatic differences tumor size. The role soy protein isoflavones prevention treatment prostate cancer remains largely undefined actively studied number centers. Re- search focused isoflavone genistein effects prostate cancer cell lines. Genistein shown in- hibit growth human prostate cancer cell lines tissue culture histoculture (22,23). In addition, genistein also inhibits proliferation induces apoptosis prostate cancer cell lines (24). Soy protein also contains noniso- flavone substances anticancer properties (Bowman- Burke inhibitor), may also responsible growth-inhibitory effect seen present study (25). In study, altering fat, soy, isoflavone content effect PSA levels. PSA well-known marker prostate cancer progression correlates tumor growth metastases (26). Because low-fat diet high soy protein isoflavone caused 15% reduc- tion final tumor weight experiment, effect may large enough cause significant change serum PSA level. Alternatively, diet may inhibited growth population tumor cells pro- duce PSA. In present study, mice fed low-fat diet high soy protein isoflavones 70% decrease total testosterone levels, although reach statisti- cal significance. Wang co-workers (13) also found low-fat diets failed reduce serum testosterone levels. Al- though several studies found correlation low-fat diets circulating androgen levels, investigation required area (27,28). Low-fat diets may cause re- duction bioavailable testosterone (free testosterone) levels increasing sex hormone-binding globulin levels, although investigations needed area well (29). In conclusion, xenograft model prostate cancer, statistically significant effects tumor growth rate final tumor weight attributable low-fat diet combined soy protein isoflavones.

In food-restricted mice, tumor growth signiﬁcantly suppressed, mean survival time tumor inoculation prolonged (P ⬍ 0.05). The plasma concentrations two antitumor cytokines, interferon-␥ (IFN-␥) tumor necrosis factor-␣ (TNF-␣), greater food-restricted group tumor inoculation (P ⬍ 0.05). Furthermore, food-restricted mice signiﬁcantly higher plasma levels IFN-␥ TNF-␣ tumor inoculation, although treatment signiﬁcantly increased cytokine levels groups. Splenic natural killer cell cytotoxicity also higher tumor-bearing food-restricted mice controls (P ⬍ 0.05).

Thus, 3.5 wk inoculation, NK cell cytotoxicity greater FR mice control mice (P ⬍ 0.05). DISCUSSION It shown FR prevents occurrence late-life spontaneous tumor development reduces in- cidence tumors induced radiation chemical carcino- gens (Higami et al. 1995, Kolaja et al. 1996, Yoshida et al. 1997). In addition, proposed effects FR onset tumors due activation host immune surveillance mechanisms (Konno et al. 1991, Wein- druch et al. 1986). Our present data obtained mice inocu- lated L1210 tumor cells show growth implanted tumor signiﬁcantly suppressed 60% FR mice, survival time longer mice (Fig. 2). In tumor-bearing state, shown tumor- primed CD4⫹ T cells activated produce IFN-␥ (Yamamoto et al. 1995). IFN-␥ possesses antiproliferative activity many transformed cell lines addition antiviral immunoregulatory functions (Abe et al. 1998, Giovarelli et al. 1986, Stark et al. 1998). TNF-␣, 114 MATSUZAKI ET AL. particularly lymphocytes (Kubo et al. 1984, Weindruch Walford 1988). In study, tumor inoculation sig- niﬁcantly change total WBC number either 60% FR control groups, lymphocyte number FR mice signiﬁcantly lower even tumor-bearing state. It shown FR induces apoptosis, immune organs, spleen thymus, comparatively sensitive apop- tosis organs (Keusch et al. 1983). Thus, low lymphocyte count FR mice may closely related apop- tosis spleen thymus. Energy restriction sug- gested enhance T cell function aged mice maintaining apoptosis levels found younger mice, thereby removing non- poorly functioning T cells (Spaulding et al. 1997). It thus thought immunologically less effective T cells eliminated FR mice, presumably apoptosis, even tumor-bearing state. Since CD4⫹ T cells participate production IFN-␥ tumor-bearing mice (Yamamoto et al. 1995), elimination nonfunctional T cells may one important factors improving antitumor immunity FR mice.

It also reported macrophage-mediated cytotox- icity L1210 cells augmented IFN-␥ synergy interleukin-2 lipopolysaccharide vitro, TNF-␣ par- ticipates cytotoxic mechanism produce nitric oxide autocrine mechanism macrophages (Jiang et al. 1992). Our data (Fig. 4) indicate normal state, IFN-␥ TNF-␣ levels signiﬁcantly greater 60% FR group compared control. Furthermore, FR mice greater abilities produce IFN-␥ TNF-␣ even inoculation L1210 tumor cells, although treatment increases cytokine production FR control groups. We contend activated production IFN-␥and TNF-␣in FR mice related closely effective suppression tumor growth. However, detailed mechanisms IFN-␥ TNF-␣ production stimulated FR unclear. It reported CD4⫹ T cell subpopulation aug- mented FR mice normal tumor-bearing states (Gartner et al. 1992, Volk et al. 1994). NK cells important antitumor effectors vitro vivo (Herberman 1985, Ortaldo Herberman 1984), high NK cell cytotoxicity associated reduc- tions tumor development (Reisenfeld et al. 1980). In 60% FR group, control group, NK cell cytotox- icity signiﬁcantly augmented tumor inoculation (Fig. 5), suggesting NK cells improve antitumor immunity FR mice. Since activated NK cells produce IFN-␥ TNF-␣ (Perussia 1991), thought NK cells par- ticipate active production IFN-␥ TNF-␣ tumor-bearing FR mice.

Introduction Cancer colon rectum second leading cause cancer death US adults (1). In United States, ~ 130 000 new cases colon cancer reported year colon cancer accounts 60 000 deaths annually. The incidence mortality rates colon cancer remained unchanged last 50 years (1,2). Since colon cancer largely refractory contemporary treatment regimens (2), alternative approach controlling disease prevention. Cancer prevention via dietary means may well cost-effective approach towards controlling disease. Epidemiological data suggest nutritional factors play major role etiology cancer many different sites (3-7). For example, high dietary levels legumes associated low cancer rates general inversely correlated incidences breast, colon prostate cancer (3,6,7). Legumes known contain high concentrations protease inhibitors (8), well agents (such lectins, etc.) may modify carcinogenesis. Protease inhibitors shown anticarcinogenic activity vivo vitro (e.g. 9-22). We reported soybean-derived Bowman-Birk inhibitor (BBI*) (8,23) suppresses dimethyl- hydrazine (DMH)-induced colon liver carcinogenesis mice, present diet (17,20), 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthra- *Abbreviations: BBI, Bowman —Birk inhibitor; DMH, dimethylhydrazine; ABBI, autoclaved BBI; SBBI, succinylated BBI. © Oxford University Press cene-induced cheek pouch carcinogenesis hamsters, topically applied (16), 3-methylcholanthrene-induced lung tumorigenesis mice (21). BBI also shown suppress carcinogen-induced malignant transformation vitro (9,22). In general, inhibitors chymotrypsin found effective suppressors transformation vitro (15). For example, nanomolar concentrations chymostatin, highly specific inhibitor chymotrypsin (24), shown inhibit radiation-induced transformation C3H/10T1/2 cells (14,15).

Results The current studies designed determine ability dose—response relationship various preparations BBI suppress DMH-induced colon carcinogenesis mice. A second objective study determine whether chymostatin ability suppress colon carcinogenesis. The mice given DMH injections maintained diets containing: (i) 0.1% (1 part per 1000), 0.01 % (0.1 part per 1000) 0.0005% (0.005 part per 1000) BBI extract; (ii) chymostatin, low mol. wt chymotrypsin inhibitor (24); (iii) modified preparations containing ABBI (autoclaving destroys chymotrypsin trypsin inhibitory activity) SBBI [this BBI preparation treated succinic anhydride, specifically succinylates critical lysine residue (Lysl6) trypsin inhibitory portion BBI molecule. This covalent modification selectively removes trypsin inhibitory activity, leaving chymotrypsin inhibitory activity intact (17,25)]. The experimental group receiving ABBI also served isocaloric diet control group treatment groups receiving various BBI preparations. In first series experiments, DMH-induced adeno- carcinomas colon 63% animals; 0.1% BBI diet significantly reduced incidence tumors DMH-treated animals 34.8% (Table I).

Discussion In present study, utilized DMH-induced colon carcinogenesis model study inhibition colon carcino- genesis mice dietary protesae inhibitors. Our results support previous findings dietary intake BBI suppress adenomatous tumors colon (17,20). BBI effective anticarcinogenic agent present concentration 0.1 %, lower concentrations inhibitor less effective ineffective reducing tumor incidence. Consequently, studies, addition previous work (17), suggest 0.1 % level BBI extract minimal concentration necessary significant reduction adenomatous tumors colon. Lower levels dietary BBI still effective suppressing tumors sites; however, 0.01% diet, BBI extract shown suppress DMH-induced angiosarcomas liver (17). It noted levels protease inhibitors shown anticarcinogenic studies roughly comparable (on mg/kg basis) estimated intake protease inhibitors specific human populations consuming relatively high levels dietary protease inhibitors, Japanese Seventh Day Adventists (17). These populations shown lower normal incidences breast, colon prostate cancer (3-7); possible low cancer incidence populations could be, least part, attributable dietary intake anticarcinogenic protease inhibitors. The inability ABBI suppress formation adeno- carcinomas provides strong evidence protease inhibitory activity necessary tumor suppression. We also observed SBBI effect colon carcinogenesis studies. SBBI contains chymotrypsin inhibitory activity trypsin inhibitory activity BBI selectively removed. A number different explanations possible results showing lack suppression carcinogenesis SBBI. Although SBBI still retains ability suppress transformation vitro, known whether ability BBI pass stomach intact form enter intestine form capable interacting proteases. Even SBBI reach intestine active protease inhibitor, may taken colonic epithelial cells efficiently BBI and, thus, may able interact with, inhibit, critical enzymes cells. Additionally, SBBI may water soluble native inhibitor and, hence, may rapidly excreted. Alternatively, trypsin inhibitory portion BBI may play important role inhibiting adenomatous colonic tumors. vitro tumor promoters We observed previously SBTI (a strong inhibitor trypsin) directly suppress radiation transformation vitro, suppress enhancement radiation-induced transformation (12,13). Consequently, chymotrypsin inhibitors likely potent anticarcinogenic agents, trypsin inhibitors, SBTI, may also cancer chemopreventive value virtue ability inhibit promotional phase carcinogenesis. Thus, tumor promotion may play important role development adenomatous tumors arising large bowel. While BBI suppressed incidence adenocarcinomas colon, affect incidence anal gland squamous cell tumors. In contrast, chymostatin suppressed incidence squamous cell tumors anal gland, effect adenocarcinomas colon. Several factors could account results, (i) The critical target enzymes involved malignant transformation cells colon anal gland different. Presumably, BBI would effective inhibitor critical target enzymes colon chymostatin effective inhibiting enzymes cells lining anal gland, (ii) BBI may absorbed efficiently epithelial cells lining colon chymostatin may effectively absorbed epithelial cells lining anal gland. While BBI water soluble, chymostatin not, hence distribution gastrointestinal tract contents may favor uptake critical epithelial cells lining gut. The fact chymostatin fat soluble could also explain selective ability affect anal gland carcinogenesis. Consequently, water solubility may important characteristic protease inhibitors suppression adenomatous tumors colon. It somewhat surprising us BBI affect squamous cell carcinomas anal gland, previously shown suppress squamous cell carcinomas hamster cheek pouch (16). As discussed elsewhere (17), cells origin squamous cell carcinomas markedly different oral anal gland epithelium, perhaps accounts observed differences ability BBI affect carcinogenesis two sites. The ability protease inhibitors suppress carcinogenesis appears vary greatly dose carcinogen administered. BBI previously shown prevent completely adenomatous tumors gastrointestinal tract doses DMH utilized considerably lower percentage animals developed tumors observed present study (17,20). We observed BBI capable suppressing 1085 17. St Clair.W.H., Billings.P.C, Carew.J.A., Keller-McGandy,C, Newbeme.P. Kennedy,A.R.

These protective effects asso- ciated soy isoﬂavones, e.g. genistein daidzein. Long-term intraperitoneal administration genistein daidzein young rats (Constantinou et al. 1996) subcutaneous injection genistein neonatal rats (Lamartiniere et al. 1995) reduce development mammary carcinoma exposure ani- mals carcinogens. Other studies showed soy-derived prod- ucts effect tumorigenesis animal models (Reddy et al. 1976). Soybean rich source dietary isoﬂavones (Murphy 1982). Isoﬂavones exist soybean primarily conjugated glycosides. Following ingestion, hydrolyzed aglycones glycosi- dases produced intestinal bacteria. The conjugates genistin, daidzin, glycitin aglycones, genistein, daidzein, glycitein constitute 90–95% total soy isoﬂavones (Murphy 1982). It appears unconjugated aglycones associated many biological properties isoﬂavones may re- sponsible anticancer activities. These include antiestro- genic activity (Folman Pope 1966), inhibition protein tyrosine kinases (Akiyama et al. 1987), regulation cell cycle progression apoptosis (Kroemer et al. 1995), antiangio- genic activity (Fotsis et al. 1993). Metastasis, spread malignant cells primary neo- plasm distant organs results development sec- ondary tumors, devastating aspect cancer. Ad- vances surgical techniques adjuvant therapies proven useful treatment primary tumors. However, metastasis remains major cause poor prognosis death cancer patients. We recently reported dietary supplementation SPI reduces pulmonary metastasis murine melanoma cells mice (Yan et al. 1997). Connolly et al. (1997) reported soybean chips inhibit metastasis human mammary carcinoma cells athymic nude mice. These studies suggest dietary soybean useful preventing spread malignant cells. The objective present study determine whether isoﬂavones present SPI reduce metastasis. To accomplish this, effect dietary supplementation isoﬂavones genistein daidzein pulmonary metastasis melanoma cells investigated using intravenous injection model.

The dietary isoﬂavone content positively correlated urinary isoﬂavone concentration mag- nitude inhibitory effect metastasis. Dietary supple- mentation isoﬂavones 900 ␮mol/kg adverse effect growth mice experimental period. These results indicate isoﬂavones effectively reduced pul- monary metastasis melanoma cells also retarded growth tumors developed lungs. The observations study provide ﬁrst evidence dietary supplementation isoﬂavones reduces experimen- tal metastasis. This supported ﬁndings oral admin- istration genistein inhibits lung metastasis melanoma cells intravenously injected mice (Menon et al. 1998). Interest- ingly, found daidzein ineffective reducing me- tastasis. In present study, effect dietary supplementation either genistein daidzein alone tested. However, concentration genistein experimental diets threefold greater daidzein. Thus, protective effect dietary isoﬂavones experimental metastasis may largely attributed genistein. Whether daidzein without effect difﬁcult conclude currently available data. In study described Menon et al. (1998), injection 1 x 106 melanoma cells mice led development uncountable massive lung tumors control daidzein-treated animals. Thus, unable determine whether daidzein effective reducing metastasis. At present, mechanism whereby dietary soybean isoﬂa- vones reduces metastasis remains unknown. The experimental metastasis model employed present study measured extravasation melanoma cells cardiovascular system interstitum lungs. This requires invasion subendothelial basement membrane. Genistein inhibits in- vasion extracellular matrix BALB/c mammary carcinoma cells vitro (Scholar Toews 1994). This may due effect genistein cell adhesion extracellular matrix. Genistein potent inhibitor protein tyrosine kinases (Akiyama et al. 1987). Protein tyrosine kinases phosphorylate tyrosine residues proteins participate signal transduc- tion events, including integrin-mediated cell adhesion (Hynes 1992). It shown genistein inhibits epithelial growth factor-stimulated integrin expression human breast cancer (Narita et al. 1996) esophageal cancer cells (Sato et al. 1996). Furthermore, genistein inhibits integrin-mediated cell ad- hesion lymphoma cells (Weimar et al. 1997) arterial smooth muscle cells (Hedin et al. 1997). These observations suggest isoﬂavones could reduce metastasis affecting cell adhesion. A second possibility reducing protease activity. Genistein inhibits secretion urokinase-type plasminogen activator metalloproteinase LM3 murine mammary tumor cells (Aguirre Ghiso et al. 1998). These effects also attrib- uted inhibition protein tyrosine kinases. It noted studies genistein used pharmacolog- ical tool study signal transduction events rather dietary component. The high concentrations employed be- yond level achievable animals consuming soy- containing diet. Thus, exposure cultured cells isoﬂavones vitro comparable providing animals soybean- TABLE 3 Effect dietary supplementation isoﬂavones tumor cross-sectional area volume metastatic tumors developed lungs mice Tumor cross-sectional area, mm2 Tumor volume, mm3 Group Mice, Tumors, Median1 Mean ⫾ SEM2 Median1 Mean ⫾ SEM2 Control Isoﬂavones 113 ␮mol/kg 225 ␮mol/kg 450 ␮mol/kg 900 ␮mol/kg 17 18 18 18 17 139 139 139 139 139 0.55 0.52 0.36** 0.32** 0.16** 0.65 ⫾ 0.03 0.61 ⫾ 0.03 0.49 ⫾ 0.03 0.41 ⫾ 0.03 0.26 ⫾ 0.03 0.21 0.19 0.10** 0.09** 0.03** 0.28 ⫾ 0.02 0.25 ⫾ 0.02 0.19 ⫾ 0.02 0.15 ⫾ 0.01 0.08 ⫾ 0.01 1 Signiﬁcantly different control, **P ⱕ 0.01.

Therefore, caution taken data vitro experiments used explain dietary effect soybean isoﬂavones animal studies. The results present study demonstrate tumor cross- sectional area volume mice fed isoﬂavone diets signiﬁcantly reduced compared mice fed basal diet. A decrease tumor size could due prolonged retention tumor cells circulatory system inhibition malignant cell proliferation take residence lungs. Most circulating B16 melanoma cells rapidly die following intra- venous injection (Fidler 1970). Approximately 1% cells survive 24 h, one tenth form tumor colonies lungs. Therefore, unlikely retention circula- tion explains difference tumor size control isoﬂavone-supplemented groups. Rather, likely difference due inhibition mitosis malignant cells lungs. Investigations laboratory designed determine effect dietary isoﬂavones cell proliferation angiogenesis formation metastatic tumor clarify possibility. Comparing results present study previous report dietary SPI experimental metastasis (Yan et al. 1997), appears SPI effective reducing number lung tumors isoﬂavone-equivalent diets. Soybean contains several potential anticancer components isoﬂavones, e. g., protease inhibitors (Kennedy 1993) saponins (Koratkar Rao 1997). Although agents largely eliminated preparation SPI, trace amounts may exist. The SPI also contains phytate shown tumor-attenuating action animal models (Shamsuddin et al. 1988). Finally, glycitein, present SPI employed previous study (Yan et al. 1997), supplemented diet present study. Thus, variations could contribute, least part, differences observed two studies. In summary, results present study demonstrate dietary supplementation isoﬂavones reduced experimen- tal metastasis melanoma cells mice also inhibited growth metastatic tumors developed lungs. We conclude isoﬂavones responsible, least part, protective effect dietary soybean experimental me- tastasis melanoma cells mice. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The authors thank Vivian W.

The Nutritional Prevention Cancer trial continues show protective effect selenium cancer incidence, although site-specific cancers exhibited reduction incidence. This treatment effect restricted males lower baseline plasma selenium concentrations. Introduction The NPC4 Trial (1) contributed substantially evidence supporting selenium chemopreventive agent. These results, cited medical literature 400 times last 5 years, also received considerable public attention. The study originally designed test efficacy selenium supplementation preventing NMSC recurrence men women history two BCCs one SCC skin. The hypothesis trial supported Clark’s observation populations southeastern United States, region soil selenium concentrations lower rest country, showed elevated NMSC rates (2). Thus, Clark colleagues initiated randomized clinical trial selenium supplementation preventing recurrence NMSC high-risk population. The original trial results failed confirm selenium supplementation prevented NMSC recurrence. Indeed, incidence new BCCs increased nonsignificant 10% among selenium-supple- mented individuals, whereas incidence new SCCs increased nonsignificant 14%. Nevertheless, early intervention, unexpected def- icit cancer mortality endpoints among selenium- supplemented participants became apparent, 1993, endpoints trial expanded include lung, prostate, colorectal cancer, well total cancer incidence total cancer mortality. In 1994, Safety Monitoring Advisory Committee recommended trial unblinded results published. The National Cancer Institute audited study May 1995, and, National Cancer Institute’s approval, blinded phase patient treatment follow-up ended February 1996. At time, participants informed treatment status, given opportunity take selenium supplements, reconsented participate Open-Label Phase trial. 4 The abbreviations used are: NPC, Nutritional Prevention Cancer; HR, hazard ratio; CI, confidence interval; NMSC, nonmelanoma skin cancer; BCC, basal cell carcinoma; SCC, squamous cell carcinoma; BMI, body mass index; PY, person- year(s); RR, relative risk; PHS, Physicians’ Health Study.

Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention 631 The apparent effects selenium supplementation can- cer incidence end 1993 (representing average 6.4 years subject follow-up) striking. The original report indicated selenium supplementation led mar- ginally statistically significant decrease (a) lung cancer in- cidence (HR ⫽ 0.56, 95% CI ⫽ 0.0.31–1.01, P ⫽ 0.05), (b) statistically significant decreases prostate cancer incidence (HR ⫽ 0.35, 95% CI ⫽ 0.18 – 0.65, P ⫽ 0.001), (c) colorectal cancer incidence (HR ⫽ 0.39, 95% CI ⫽ 0.17– 0.90, P ⫽ 0.03), (d) total cancer incidence (HR ⫽ 0.61, 95% CI ⫽ 0.46 – 0.82, P ⬍ 0.001), (e) total cancer mortality (HR ⫽ 0.48, 95% CI ⫽ 0.0.31– 0.76, P ⫽ 0.001). The current report adds considerably statistical precision trial extending previously reported results (September 15, 1983 December 31, 1993) entire blinded phase trial (September 15 1983 February 1, 1996). With total cancer incidence primary end point, mean subject follow-up time enhanced 1 year average 7.4 years. Overall, selenium supplementation con- tinued reduce incidence total cancer prostate, colorectal, lung cancers, although reduction inci- dence latter two cancers statistically significant. Not site-specific cancers presented report exhibited reduction risk selenium supplementation. In addition, analysis describes effect selenium supplementation total cancer incidence within subgroups defined key baseline characteristics including age, gender, smoking status, plasma selenium. The protective effect selenium sup- plementation total cancer incidence prominent males lower baseline plasma selenium concen- trations. Although examination treatment effects sub- group analyses fraught potential limitations, modest sample size limits statistical power interpretation, subgroup analyses important dataset provide oppor- tunity evaluate trends data, may understanding effectiveness selenium chemopre- ventive agent. Materials Methods The protocol NPC study described original report Clark et al. (1). Briefly, study randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted among 1312 participants living Eastern United States. Participants history two BCCs one SCC skin, one occurring within year prior randomization. Participants life expectancy least 5 years internal malignancies treated within previous 5 years. Exclusion criteria included history significant liver kidney disorders. Although recruitment gender neutral, approximately three-quarters participants male. This study conducted dermatology clinics seven cities located low-selenium areas United States, including Augusta, Georgia; Macon, Georgia; Columbia, South Carolina; Miami, Florida; Wilson, North Carolina; Greenville, North Caro- lina; Newington, Connecticut. Recruitment began Septem- ber 15, 1983 continued year 1991. Participants randomized double-blinded fashion experimental treatment identical placebo. Experimental participants treated 200 ␮g selenium supplied 0.5-g high-selenium baker’s yeast tablet provided Nutrition 21 (La Jolla, CA) 1995 Cypress Systems (Fresno, CA) thereafter. The selenium content batch pills determined laboratories Dr. G. F. Combs, Jr. Dr. I. S. Palmer (South Dakota State University, Brookings, SD) using diaminonaptha- lene-fluorometric procedure nitric-perchloric acid digestion (3). Plasma selenium concentration determined labora- tory Dr. G. F. Combs, Jr. automated electrothermal atomic absorption spectrophotometry (Perkin-Elmer 3030; Perkin-Elmer Corp., Norwalk, CT) equipped electrodeless discharge lamp automatic Zeeman-effect background correction. Quality control included multiple aliquots human plasma external control samples. A coefficient variation ⬍7% (for duplicate analyses) criterion acceptance (4). At baseline interview, sociodemographic behav- ioral variables including education (number years school- ing, 0 –18), occupation (classified according NIH standards), numbers years farm, use vitamin supplements, use sunscreen, cancer screening information, number alcoholic drinks/day, smoking status (current, former, never), number cigarettes smoked/day, years smoking collected participants. In addition, thorough medical medication history obtained baseline updated biannual follow-up visit. Patient medical records clinic reviewed periodically ascertain information study nonstudy visits ensure completeness accuracy information. For participants became in- active, annual contact attempted using National Death Index ChoicePoint (formerly Equifax Inc.) determine vital status identify diagnoses new illnesses. In event reports new illnesses medical procedures, research nurses requested medical, surgical, pathology records physicians hospitals documentation. Searches addi- tional cases cancer also performed state tumor registry clinic site located. An oncologist appropriate medical specialist reviewed every cancer record confirmed diagnosis. A nosologist coded death certificates. Review coding records occurred blinded manner. At end blinded period treatment February 2, 1996, 35.9% participants still treatment, 16.6% treatment still routine dermatological ex- aminations, 22.1% participants censored dermato- logical endpoints endpoints, 24.8% died. After total 9301 PY follow-up, participants lost vital follow-up, seven subjects (three sele- nium group four placebo group) declined provide additional illness information. Participant-reported compliance indicated 79.3% participants (80.3% placebo group 78.4% selenium group) missed taking pill less twice month. Sixty-two participants (including two cancer cases treatment group) whose initial blood draws drawn ⬎4 days randomization date excluded analysis. Thus, statistical analyses based data 1250 participants initial blood draws within 4 days randomization.

Discussion The NPC Trial double-blind, placebo-controlled, ran- domized trial date tested effect selenium supple- mentation cancer incidence Western population. The orig- inal secondary analyses NPC data showed highly significant inverse association selenium supplementation incidence total cancer December 31, 1993, mean period 6.4 years follow-up (1). In report, describe analyses effect selenium supplementation total cancer incidence end randomized, blinded treatment (February 1, 1996). This extended follow-up attenuated protective effect selenium supplementation total cancer incidence, although selenium supplementation continued reduce incidence total cancer mean follow-up 7 years. A significant inverse association common cancer, prostate cancer, observed. For next common sites, lung colorectal cancers, respectively, inverse non- significant associations selenium supplementation inci- dence determined. These results consistent majority epidemiological studies support efficacy selenium chemopreventive agent cancers (8–16) prostate (17–19), lung (12, 20–24), colorectal cancers (25–28). However, epidemiological trials consistently support protective association selenium cancer (26, 29 – 41). Of remaining eight cancer sites evaluated report, nonsignificant reductions incidence apparent three categories: (a) carcinomas; (b) noncarcinomas; (c) esophageal cancer. Results epidemiological trials three cancer categories inconsistent (41– 45). Conversely, nonsignificant increases incidence evident five cancer types, including melanoma, bladder can- cer, breast cancer, head neck cancer, lymphoma leukemia. These results, although nonsignificant based small case numbers, may indicate potential increased risk selenium supplementation. Previous reports effects selenium melanoma (24, 46 – 49), bladder cancer (33, 48, 50), head neck cancer (51–53), lymphoma leuke- mia (24, 37, 41, 54) epidemiological trials varied. The evidence associating selenium status breast cancer conflicting. Analogous observed NPC Trial, several prospective studies shown nonsignificant positive associations serum (24) toenail (55, 56) selenium status breast cancer. However, lack association serum (57), toenail (58), four indicators (59) selenium status breast cancer risk suggested several case-control studies. Similarly, several prospective tri- als shown equivocal associations serum (37, 60) toenail (61) selenium status breast cancer risk. Many case-control studies suggested protective effect higher selenium status (26, 62, 63) postmenopausal pre- menopausal women (64). In addition, inverse trends breast cancer selenium concentrations serum (29), toe- nails (65), drinking water (41) suggested prospective trials, although results nonsignificant. More- over, significant inverse associations breast cancer risk serum (66 – 68) hair (23) selenium docu- mented. Methodological issues, primarily difficulty assess- ing long-term selenium exposure, may explain inconsistencies association selenium cancer re- ported epidemiological trials (69). In addition, treatment disease may alter selenium status thus may lead temporal ambiguity misclassification selenium status. Nevertheless, meta-analysis cohort studies comparing as- sociations serum selenium, retinol, ␤-carotene, vitamin E cancer suggests selenium remarkably consist- ent protective effect (70). Furthermore, evidence chemopreventive efficacy selenium consistently represented laboratory trials, although exact mechanism(s) activity unclear. The overwhelming majority vivo studies rodents shown various forms selenium inhibit carcinogen-induced co- valent DNA adduct formation retard oxidative damage DNA, lipids, proteins multiple organ sites (71). In vitro vivo systems shown tumor cell growth, cell prolifer- ation, cell cycle biomarkers; apoptosis; p53 expression; cyclooxygenase 2 expression; DNA, RNA, protein synthesis; activation transcriptional factors activator protein 1 nuclear factor ␬B; activities protein kinase C protein kinase A, thymidine kinase, c-Jun-NH2-kinase, DNA cytosine methyltransferase; 8-isoprostane formation modified various forms selenium treatment (71). Effect Modification. Several potential effect modifiers effect selenium supplementation total cancer pre- sented analysis, including age baseline, gender, baseline smoking plasma selenium statuses. Our data sug- gest gender baseline plasma selenium status predict effect selenium supplementation total cancer. Gender. The high proportion males trial reflects higher age-adjusted incidence NMSC among men living United States (for BCC, 247/100,000 PY males 150/100,000 PY females; SCC, 65/100,000 24/ 100,000 PY males females, respectively) (72). The difference participation women also reflects reli- Downloaded cebp.aacrjournals.org June 11, 2018. © 2002 American Association Cancer Research. 636 Se Supplementation Cancer Incidence: The NPC Trial ance three Veterans Administration hospitals subject recruitment, overwhelming preponderance males among potentially eligible patients. Whereas recruitment patients gender blind, likely lower number females trial lower incidence cancer limited power investigate interaction be- tween gender treatment. Thus, apparent interaction gender treatment statistically significant, overall protective treatment effect detectable among males. Moreover, although effect men appeared concentrated whose baseline plasma selenium con- centrations median lowest tertiles, baseline plasma selenium status modify treatment effect among women (data shown). This discrepancy effect selenium supplementa- tion cancer protection gender also noted else- where. A case-control study total cancer mortality nested within prospective trial 10,532 persons Netherlands showed among males, mean serum selenium cases significantly less controls adjusted risk cancer mortality lowest quintile serum sele- nium (⬍100.8 ng/ml) twice men higher concentrations (RR ⫽ 2.7, 90% CI ⫽ 1.2– 6.2; Ref. 30). In females, however, selenium concentrations similar among cases controls, evidence increased cancer mortality associated low serum selenium (30). Similar results observed longitudinal study 39,268 men women participating Finnish Social Insurance Institu- tion’s Mobile Clinic Health Examination Survey (29). Effect modification gender may attributed part gender differences selenium metabolism. In European study, females excreted significantly higher amounts sele- nium per kilogram body weight compared males (73). Furthermore, whole-body residence time body load ad- justed body weight estimated greater males females (74). Patterson et al. (74) speculated gender differences might reflect hormonal differences strong affinity testes selenium. Thus, future chemoprevention trials may need consider dose adjustments gender (74) whether large numbers women included study samples. Clearly, need evaluate gender may modify effect selenium cancer outcomes. Smoking. After adjustment age gender, selenium sup- plementation associated statistically significant re- duction total cancer incidence among former smokers nonsignificant reductions among never current smok- ers. This consistent proposal former smokers ideal target population chemoprevention trials (75, 76). The ␣-Tocopherol ␤-Carotene Cancer Prevention Study Group (77) documented nonsignificant reduction lung cancer incidence ␣-tocopherol increased lung cancer inci- dence ␤-carotene heavy current smokers. Cumulative continuing exposure tobacco smoke may over- whelmed effect chemopreventive agents usually associ- ated early initiation promotion stages carcinogen- esis (78). Baseline Plasma Selenium. Clark et al. (1) reported se- lenium supplementation greatest effect prostate cancer prevention men trial lowest base- line plasma selenium status. In current analyses, pro- tective effect treatment total cancer incidence like- wise confined participants lowest tertile baseline plasma selenium. Moreover, formal interaction base- line plasma selenium tertile treatment detected analysis. Modification association treatment cancer incidence baseline status supplemented nutrient strikingly similar treatment effects prostate cancer observed PHS (79, 80). Within placebo group PHS, lowest versus highest quartile baseline plasma ␤-carotene experienced marginally signifi- cant increased risk prostate cancer (RR ⫽ 1.45, 95% CI ⫽ 0.98 –2.15), marginally significant P trend plasma quartiles. However, men lowest quartile randomly assigned ␤-carotene supplementation significant re- duction prostate cancer risk (RR ⫽ 0.68, 95% CI ⫽ 0.46 – 0.99) compared assigned placebo. Supplementa- tion highest baseline quartile associated nonsignificant increase risk (RR ⫽ 1.33, 95% CI ⫽ 0.91–1.96). Thus, ␤-carotene supplementation PHS re- duced risk prostate cancer among individuals low baseline plasma ␤-carotene levels. In current analysis NPC Trial, attempts glean information nature effect modification selenium treatment baseline plasma selenium reveal complex confusing pattern, one entirely consistent understanding selenium protective cancer. Indeed, results clearly indicate lack protective effect among participants whose baseline plasma selenium concen- trations upper tertile. It noteworthy group participants selected basis residency area selenium intake likely lower regions United States. Thus, results provide little support use 200 ␮g selenium/day protect cancer among average-risk individuals plasma concentrations United States estimated average 123 ng/ml (mean ⫾ SD serum selenium 16,693 subjects obtained Third National Health Nutrition Exam- ination Survey (NHANES III) 123 ⫾ 17 ng/ml (81). In addition, among selenium-supplemented individuals, observe striking association; higher baseline concentrations experienced elevated incidence cancer. A pattern modestly decreased incidence among placebo partic- ipants coupled risk gradient among treated participants seems somewhat plausible; however, pattern observed clearly unpredicted unsettling. It critical effect evaluated carefully controlled mechanistic studies. There several limitations study. First, men- tioned earlier, total site-specific cancers (excluding NMSC) primary endpoints NPC Trial (82). Neverthe- less, ascertainment endpoints change throughout entirety trial February 1, 1996. Second, trial possessed differential statistical power detect overall treatment effect males versus females, well gender-specific cancers. An adequately powered hypothesis-driven biomarker study thus conducted females, women included large-scale chemopre- vention trials selenium. A third limitation inherent difficulty assessment selenium status. Due varia- tions levels element foodstuffs un- certainty availability absorption different forms element, simple measures dietary selenium intake indicative general status population sufficient determining selenium status individuals (83). It therefore necessary measure biochemical concentrations selenium body simply gross intake (83). Ideally, combination two indices selenium status would ensure accurate assessment. However, Downloaded cebp.aacrjournals.org June 11, 2018. © 2002 American Association Cancer Research. 98.5% NPC participants plasma selenium concen- trations greater 70 –90 ng/ml required maximize plasma selenoproteins (84, 85), plasma selenium index used measure selenium status trial. Although plasma selenium concentrations reflect long-term selenium sta- tus populations relatively constant selenium intakes, seems prudent future selenium chemoprevention trials in- clude multiple sequential plasma measures randomiza- tion accurately define individual’s baseline plasma selenium status. Finally, although incidence estimates adjusted potential confounders age, gender, smoking status, lack detailed information unmeasured risk factors family history cancer, physical activity level, bio- chemical status nutrients, dietary intake data foods alcohol possible limitation. Randomization minimize likelihood confounding factors. However, noteworthy that, 1994 –1995, plasma selenium concentrations measured 1134 British people ages 65 years strongly directly correlated plasma zinc, cholesterol, vitamin C, several carotenoids, ␣-tocopherol, independent age (86). Thus, future investiga- tions cohort consider impact antioxi- dants, including tocopherols carotenoids, cancer incidence extent may modulate effect selenium supplementation. In addition, plan conduct genotype analyses study cohort determine effect selenium supplementation activity inducible en- zyme thiolmethyltransferase, critical methyla- tion selenium compounds; prevalence genetic poly- morphisms key genes selenium carcinogen metabolism, including thiolmethyltransferase, classical gluta- thione peroxidase (GSHPx-1; Refs. 87 88), recently identified Mr 15,000 selenoprotein (89); effect polymorphisms cancer incidence response selenium supplementation. In conclusion, summary analysis NPC Trial, includes data entire period blinded treatment, continues provide support efficacy selenium sup- plementation reducing total cancer incidence, total cancer mortality, incidence prostate cancer and, lesser extent, lung colorectal cancer. Not site-specific cancers exhibited reduction incidence, although small case numbers limit precision data. Indeed, incidences several site-specific cancers, including breast cancer, nonsignifi- cantly increased average 7.4 years follow-up.

We analyzed effect type amount carbohydrates ovarian cancer risk, using glycemic index (GI) glycemic load (GL) measurement large case–control study conducted Italy. Materials methods: Cases included 1031 women incident, histologically confirmed epithelial ovarian cancer, four Italian regions. Controls included 2411 women admitted hospital networks acute, non-neoplastic conditions. Average daily GI GL calculated validated food frequency questionnaire. Odds ratios (OR) corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) computed using multiple logistic regression. Results: Ovarian cancer directly associated dietary GI (OR highest versus lowest quartile = 1.7, 95% CI 1.3–2.1) GL (OR = 1.7, 95% CI 1.3–2.1). The associations observed pre- post- menopausal women, remained consistent across strata major covariates identified. Conclusions: This study supports hypothesis direct association GI GL ovarian cancer risk and, consequently, possible role hyperinsulinemia/insulin resistance ovarian cancer development.

Data analytical, mainly case–control studies sup- ported hypothesis possible increased risk relation various types fat [2, 6]. Carbohydrates also shown increase risk epithelial ovarian cancer [8]. Different carbohydrates, however, affect blood glucose insulin levels varying degrees depending nature carbohydrate type extent food processing [9]. On basis ranked using glycemic index (GI) glycemic load (GL). Foods high GI tend increase glucose insulin levels greater extent low GI foods [9]. In turn, proposed insulin may directly indirectly involved carcinogenic process modulating hormonal levels sex hormones insulin-like growth factors (IGF) [10]. High-GL diets directly associated risk various Western chronic conditions, including dia- betes [11], coronary heart disease [12], colorectal [13] breast [14] cancer, high insulin levels may one mech- anisms action risk factors shared diseases [15]. We thus evaluated possible differential effects carbo- hydrate-rich foods epithelial ovarian cancer risk means GI GL measurements large case–control study. Materials methods A multicenter case–control study ovarian cancer conducted January 1992 September 1999 four Italian regions: Greater Milan, provinces Pordenone, Padua Gorizia (north-eastern Italy); province Latina (central Italy); urban area Naples (southern Italy). Cases included women incident, histologically confirmed epithelial ovarian cancer diagnosed within 1 year prior interview previ- ous diagnosis cancer. Overall, 1031 women aged 18–79 years (median age 56 years) included. Controls included patients history cancer admitted hospitals serving areas cases identified. Eligible diagnoses acute, non-neoplastic, non- gynecological conditions, unrelated hormonal digestive tract diseases, associated long-term modifications diet. They included 2411 women, aged 17–79 years (median age 57 years), belonging following diagnostic categories: trauma, mostly fractures sprains (26%); orthopedic disorders, low back pain disc disorders (28%); acute surgical conditions (15%); illnesses, eye, ear, nose, skin dental conditions (31%). Cases frequency matched controls accord- ing quinquennium age area residence. Approximately 4% cases controls approached interview hospital stay refused participate. The structured questionnaire coding manual used center, interviewers centrally trained routinely supervised. The checking data consistency reliability also conducted centrally. The questionnaire included information sociodemographic characteristics, education occupation, lifelong smoking habits, physical activity various ages, anthropometric measures, problem- oriented personal medical history, family history selected cancers, menstrual reproductive history, history use oral contraceptives, hormone replacement treatment, female hormone-containing drugs indications. Dietary habits investigated interviewer- administered food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) included 78 items. This questionnaire used assess subjects’ habitual diet 2 years prior cancer diagnosis hospital admission (for controls), included questions average weekly frequency consumption foods food groups, well complex recipes. Satisfactory reproducibility [16] validity [17] FFQ reported. Details methodology used described elsewhere [13, 14]. To compute energy nutrient intake, Italian food-composition database used. For food, expressed GI percentage glycemic response elicited using ‘white bread’ standard food. We calculated daily average GI summing products carbohydrate content per serving food recipe, multiplied average number servings food per week, multi- plied GI, divided total amount available carbohydrate weekly intake. This represents ‘quality carbohydrates’, namely slow versus fast absorbable carbohydrates. A score daily average GL computed GI, without dividing total amount carbo- hydrates. For calculations used carbohydrate content 50 foods recipes, since 28 foods recipes, chiefly cheese, meat fish-based, contained negligible amount carbohydrate. With respect GI values, chiefly used international tables. In order take account Italian cooking habits (e.g. pasta ‘al dente’), Italian sources used local recipes. Food items GI determined assigned GI nearest comparable food (e.g. tangerines assigned GI oranges). Odds ratios (ORs) corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) quartiles GI GL intake computed using unconditional multiple logistic regression models [18]. The regression equations included terms quinquennia age, study center, years education, occupational physical activity, history diabetes, oral contraceptive use, parity, menopausal status, 79 number daily meals, intakes fiber, alcohol total energy intake. Adjustment energy made using residuals method. The modifying effect various covariates evaluated comparing differences –2 log likelihood model without interaction terms, referring chi square distribution degrees freedom equal number interaction terms minus one. Results Table 1 gives distribution ovarian cancer cases control subjects according age, education, menopausal status potential confounding factors. Cases better educated controls, lower parity, frequently reported family history ovarian and/or breast cancer, lower occupational phys- ical activity. GI positively correlated GL (Pearson correlation coefficient, r = 0.53), intake bread (r = 0.59), cereals (r = 0.56), cakes sweets (r = 0.33), sugar (r = 0.26), available carbo- hydrates (r = 0.37), cereal fibre (r = 0.42), negatively correlated fruit (r = –0.19) vegetables (r = –0.11). Correlations GI dietary non-dietary factors weak (i.e. |r| < 0.10). Table 2 shows ORs epithelial ovarian cancer according quartiles GI GL, total carbohydrate intake menopausal status. Dietary GI GL directly associated ovarian cancer risk, ORs, highest versus lowest quartile, 1.7 (95% CI 1.3–2.1) 1.7 (95% CI 1.3–2.1), respectively. However, ORs quartile GI GL show linear trends, already elevated second quartile tended plateau thereafter. Associations, particularly GI, appreciably stronger postmenopausal compared premenopausal women, although significant heterogeneity emerged. Total carbohydrate intake also associated ovarian cancer (OR = 1.8, highest quartile, 95% CI 1.3–2.4) postmenopausal women (Table 2). Table 3 shows relationship GI epithelial ovarian cancer different strata known suspected risk factors ovarian cancer. No substantial effect modification apparent strata of: family history ovarian breast cancer; oral contraceptive use; parity. The relationship GI epithelial ovarian cancer risk also analyzed separate strata history diabetes, body mass index (BMI), BMI increase age 30, waist hip (W/H) ratio, occupational physical activity alcohol intake (Table 4). There consistent pattern risk among diabetic subjects different strata BMI, BMI increase age 30, W/H ratio. There was, however, significant modifying effect alco- hol, consistent association GI alcohol abstainers. The association GI stronger women reporting higher physical activity. Although risk factors, including dietary factors, may differ relationship specific histological subtypes ovarian cancer [19], relevant difference emerged replicated analyses GI GL invasive serous ovarian cancer only. Other histological subtypes represented <10% cases data set. 80 Table 1.

Discussion The present study shows direct associations dietary GI GL epithelial ovarian cancer risk. An elevated risk found second quartile GI GL, show increase third fourth (highest) quartile. These associations consistent across different strata known potential risk factors ovarian cancer. However, relation- ship GI epithelial ovarian cancer study somewhat stronger post- compared premenopausal women, women without family history parae. Diets high GI GL associated high consump- tion refined carbohydrates, quickly absorbed capable elevating blood glucose insulin level greater extent slowly absorbed ones, pulses whole grains, low GI foods [20]. The main sources carbo- hydrates Italian population bread, high GI food, pasta, medium-low GI food, representing 20.5% 13.4% total carbohydrate intake, respectively [13]. High insulin levels suggested potential unifying mechanism risk several Western chronic diseases related high intakes energy, fat, refined carbohydrates, low physical activity obesity [15]. Central obesity (i.e. high W/H ratio) associated ovarian cancer risk study [21]. Diabetes, characterized high insulin levels early stages, considered possible correlate ovarian cancer risk. However, line studies [22, 23] history diabetes found consistently affect ovarian cancer risk present study. This could, however, resulted small absolute number diabetic subjects (∼4%). Insulin growth factor cancer cells, shown act cancer promoter vitro animal studies [15, 24]. Insulin also affinity IGF receptors, particularly IGF-1 receptor, strong mitogenic effects normal neoplastic cells, including ovarian carcinoma cell lines, found higher levels non-malignant cells [25]. Epidemiological evidence suggests promoting effect hyperinsulinemia [15] IGF-1 carcinogenesis [25]. Insulin IGF-1 also powerful negative regulators sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) synthesis vitro, may stimulate ovarian cancer proliferation hormonal pathway [26]. An interaction insulin, IGFs sex hormones also suggested breast cancer [27]. As case–control studies, recall selection biases possible [18]. However, awareness dietary hypotheses, particularly related GI GL, ovarian cancer limited Italian population study conducted. While conceivable dietary habits hospital controls may differed general population, great attention paid study minimize bias excluding control subjects admitted conditions might associated special dietary habits. Of greater concern early weight loss often occurring ovarian cancer patients, may led cases increase energy and, hence, carbohydrate intake [21]. We had, however, information weight loss year prior cancer diagnosis interview. Stratification adjustment weight recent weight loss modify association GI GL. Interviewing subjects hospital setting may allowed greater compar- ability dietary history cases controls [28], adjustment total energy intake controlled potential dietary over- under-reporting. Furthermore, parti- cipation among eligible patients practically complete catchment areas cases controls highly comparable. GI estimates limitations. Some GI estimates derived small samples variability unclear [13]. Statistics average dietary GI GL general Italian population available, intakes bread pasta present study similar reported Italian population [29]. In addition, would important confirm association GI, GL ovarian cancer different populations, since genotype insulin resistance may vary ethnic groups [30]. The major strength study uniquely large dataset, allowed reasonably precise risk estimates. Other strengths include consistency findings, major categories con- trols used separately, reliance validated food frequency questionnaire [16, 17]. In conclusion, study found associations dietary GI, GL ovarian cancer risk, thus supporting possible role insulin insulin-related factors ovarian carcinogenesis. Similar associations observed colorectal [13] breast [14] cancer, indicating potential role factors several common neoplasms. 83 Acknowledgements This work supported contribution Italian Association Research Cancer, Italian League Against Cancer, Milan, Italy.

Fraumeni, Jr., You-Hui Zhang, Bing Li* 1985 Background: Epidemiologic evidence indicates diets high fruits vegetables associated reduced risk several cancers, including cancers esophagus stomach. Vitamins minerals foods may contribute reduced cancer risk. The people Linxian County, China, one world's highest rates esophageal/gastric cardla cancer persistently low intake several micronutrients. Pur- pose: We sought determine dietary supplementation specific vitamins minerals lower mortality incidence cancer well mortality diseases Linxian. Methods: Individuals ages 40-69 recruited four Linxian communes. Mortality cancer incidence March 1986-May 1991 ascertained 29584 adults received daily vitamin mineral supplementation throughout period. The subjects randomly assigned intervention groups according one-half replicate 24 factorial experimental design. This design enabled testing effects four combina- tions nutrients: (A) retinol zinc; (B) riboflavin niacin; (C) vitamin C molybdenum; (D) beta carotene, vitamin E, selenium. Doses ranged one two times U.S. Recommended Daily Allowances. Results: A total 2127 deaths occurred among trial participants intervention period. Cancer leading cause death, 32% deaths due esophageal stomach cancer, followed cerebrovascu- lar disease (25%). Significantly (P = .03) lower total mortality (relative risk [RR] = 0.91; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.84-0.99) occurred among receiving supplementation beta carotene, vitamin E, selenium. The reduction mainly due lower cancer rates (RR = 0.87; 95% CI = 0.75-1.00), especially stomach cancer (RR = 0.79; 95% CI = 0.64-0.99), reduced risk beginning arise 1-2 years start supplementation vitamins minerals. No significant effects mortality rates causes found supplementation retinol zinc, riboflavin niacin, vitamin C molybdenum. Patterns cancer incidence, basis 1298 cases, generally resembled cancer mortality. Conclusions: The findings indicate vitamin mineral supplementation diet Linxian adults, particularly combination beta car- otene, vitamin E, selenium, may effect reduction cancer risk population. Implications: The results definitive, promising findings stimulate research clarify potential benefits micronutrient supplements.

Finally, Linxian setting, relatively remote, rural area China population marginally deficient number nutrients, suggest caution extrapolating findings populations. total mortality, due mostly lowered risk cancer, among receiving combination beta carotene, vitamin E, selenium. There differential effect mortality stomach cancer (21% reduction) cancers (20% reduction) versus esophageal cancer (4% reduction), suggesting benefit may vary site and/ cell type.

For example, beta carotene inhibited formation UV-induced skin cancers, oral carcinomas caused dimethylbenzanthracene exposure, colon tumors develop following dimethylhydrazine exposure. Vitamin E selenium also lowered incidence tumors number experiments involving exposure different carcinogens, although studies (6,7) suggested either effect enhancement carcinogenesis.

Risks among persons highest intakes often low one half lowest intakes several foods, especially citrus fruits fresh green, orange, yellow vegetables. Although difficult identify specific components foods may responsible decreased risk, role beta carotene possibly carotenoids suggested case-control studies esophageal stomach cancers, including studies China (5,6,16-18).

Although numbers esophageal stomach cancers likely arise trials considerably smaller Linxian, evaluation effects supplementation cancers possible. The mechanisms beta carotene, vitamin E, selenium inhibit cancer development clear, might involve antioxidant properties (6). These compounds, especially beta carotene, quench free radicals protect oxidative damage DNA. The nutrients also inhibit endogenous formation N-nitroso compounds, potent carcinogens animal experiments suspected risk factors stomach esophageal cancers human populations, including Linxian's (35,36). Beta car- otene, vitamin E, selenium may also possess immu- nologic properties influence carcinogenesis (6).

A significant reduction stomach cancer mortality observed among receiving retinol zinc, counterbalanced increase gastric cardia cancer mortality group. A potential benefit retinol cancer risk postulated basis role maintaining cell integrity ability certain retinoids inhibit chemically induced tumors laboratory animals, although experimental models, vitamin A (6). Epidemiologic support beneficial effect vitamin A, although suggestive one time, waned since trial began. Several found evidence protective effect dietary serum retinol esophageal stomach cancers, consensus suggest- ing benefits associated vitamin A precursor beta carotene (37).

Indeed, riboflavin status measured erythrocyte glutathione reductase activity severely depressed Linxian compared United States; 90% Linxian population termed deficient (8-11). Riboflavin deficiencies induced esophageal hyperplasia baboons altered metabolism nitrosamines (43,44). Supplementation riboflavin niacin, along zinc, magnesium, molybdenum, inhibited esopha- geal carcinogenesis corn-fed rats (45). In Uzbekistan, nutrient Journal National Cancer Institute, Vol. 85, No. 18, September 15, 1993 ARTICLES 1489 esophageal cancer riboflavin niacin supplements, however, supplementation riboflavin 20 months successful reversing chronic esophagitis (28). We found esophageal cancer incidence mortality 14% 10% lower, respectively, among receiving daily 14% reduction incidence borderline statistical significance. Total cancer incidence mortality, however, slightly reduced among receiving B vitamin supplementation, thus providing weak support protective effect. On hand, limited priori evidence suggests benefit riboflavin niacin may pronounced esophageal cancer. Thus, view finding lowered esophageal cancer incidence encouraging sign worthy additional investigation. Vitamin C suggested protective several cancers, particularly stomach cancer (6). Although results experimental studies mixed, case-control studies stomach esophageal cancers shown adult diets patients typically low intake vitamin C-containing inhibit endogenous formation nitrosamines, antioxidant biological properties inhibit carcinogenesis (46). Data Linxian trial, however, showed evidence reduced cancer mortality incidence (in fact, RRs 1.0) among persons receiving daily vitamin C molybdenum supplements doses approximately twice U.S. RDAs.

Vitamin C may also foods shortness (5!/4 years) The failure trial find significant reductions cancer mortality among supplemented retinol zinc, riboflavin niacin, vitamin C molybdenum could related intervention follow-up. Indeed, nutrients protective effect early stages carcinogenesis, focus concurrent events adults taking supplements would expected show mortality differential. The data suggest supplementation particular nutrients resulted demonstrable short-term mortality benefit. Continued monitoring participants determine whether reductions cancer disease may emerge coming years. cerebrovascular disease 10% Several reports suggested antioxidant nutrients may reduce risk progression cerebrovascular disease, common cause death Linxian, perhaps lower rate hypertension, strong risk factor (6,47-49). We found significant treatment group differences, mortality lower among receiving supplements antioxidants beta carotene, vitamin E, selenium.

Blot* Background: A number vitamins minerals shown influence carcinogenesis experimental animals. In humans, epidemiologic evidence suggests intake fruits vegetables may reduce risk esophageal cancers. Vitamins minerals foods may contribute reduced cancer risk. The people Linxian, China, persistently low intake multiple nutrients exhibit one world's highest rates esophageal/gastric cardia cancer, exceptionally high risk esophageal dysplasia. Purpose: To determine whether supplementation multiple vitamins minerals may reduce esophageal/ gastric cardia cancer among persons esophageal dysplasia, conducted 6-year prospective intervention trial Linxian. Methods: Mortality cancer incidence ascertained May 1985 May 1991 3318 persons cytologic evidence esophageal dysplasia randomly assigned receive, throughout period, daily supplementation 14 vitamins 12 minerals placebo. Doses typically two three times U.S. Recommended Daily Allowances. Compliance assessed counting unused pills monthly trial participants assaying nutrient samples individuals randomly selected without replacement every 3 months throughout trial. Cancers identified routine surveillance special cytology endoscopy screenings 2lA years 6 years. Results: A total 324 deaths occurred 6-year inter- vention period; 167 occurred control (placebo) group 157 occurred supplement group. Cancer leading cause death (54% deaths); 18% due cerebrovascular diseases 29% causes. Cumulative esophageal/gastric cardia death rates 8% [RR] = 0.92; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.67-1.28) among individuals blood collected (relative risk levels lower receiving supplements rather placebo, nonsignifi- cant (P>.IO) difference.

High intake re- ¢ned carbohydrates markers insulin resistance associated colorectal cancer. To test insulin/colon cancer hypothesis, determined whether dietary glyce- mic index glycemic load associated colorectal cancer risk. Design: A case-control study colorectal cancer con- ducted Italy. Cases included 1125 men 828 women histologically con¢rmed incident cancer colon rectum. Controls 2073 men 2081 women hospitalized acute conditions. We calculated average daily dietary glycemic index glycemic load, ¢ber intake validated food frequency questionnaire. Results: Direct associations colorectal cancer risk emerged glycemic index (odds ratio (OR) highest vs. lowest quintile = 1.7; 95% con¢dence interval (CI): 1.4^2.0) glycemic load (OR = 1.8; 95% CI: 1.5^2.2), allowance sociodemographic factors, physical activity, number daily meals, intakes ¢ber, alcohol energy. ORs elevated cancer colon rectum. Overweight low intake ¢ber vegetables fruit appeared amplify adverse consequences high glycemic load. Conclusions: The positive associations glycemic index load colorectal cancer suggest detrimental role re¢ned carbohydrates etiology disease. Key words: colon cancer, ¢ber, glycemic load, rectal cancer Introduction Carbohydrate foods consumed isoglucidic amounts produce di¡erent glycemic insulinemic responses depending upon nature food (e.g., ratio amylose amylopectin, amount type ¢ber, particle size starch granules) type extent food processing (e.g., extrusion, £aking, grinding, cooking) [1]. A role diets high glycemic response consequent hyperinsulinemia colorectal carcinogene- sis postulated [2, 3]. Several ¢ndings Italian case-control study support hypothesis. Direct associations found colorectal cancer intake re¢ned carbohydrates energy [4], number daily meals [5], body mass index (BMI) men and, among women, central adiposity [6]. Conversely, inverse associations emerged intake vegetables, pulses, ¢sh [7], ¢bre [8], unsaturated-to-saturated fat ratio [4], level physical activity [9]. In order test insulin/colon cancer hypothesis, decided evaluate dietary carbohydrate compo- nent using glycemic index (GI), indicator carbohydrate foods’ ability raise blood glucose levels, glycemic load score (GL), combination quality well quantity carbohydrates consumed, thus measure dietary insulin demand. Patients methods A case-control study cancer colon rectum conducted January 1992 June 1996 six Italian areas: provinces Pordenone Gorizia North-eastern Italy; urban areas Milan Genoa provinces Forl|' , North; Latina urban area Naples South [7].

Conversely, comorbidity conditions represent exclusion criterion. The control group included 2073 men 2081 women aged 19^74 years (median age 58) belonging following diagnostic categories: trauma, mostly fractures sprains (27%); orthopedic disorders, low back disc disorders (24%); acute surgical conditions (18%); eye diseases (24%); miscellaneous diseases, ear, nose, throat, skin dental conditions (7%). About 4% cases controls approached hospital stay refused interviewed. The structured questionnaire coding manual used center, interviewers centrally trained routinely supervised. The questionnaire included information socio-demo- graphic characteristics, education occupation, lifetime smoking alcohol-drinking habits, physical activity, anthropomet- ric measures various ages, problem-oriented personal medical history family history cancer. Body mass index (BMI) computed weight kilograms divided height square meters. In order compute waist-to-hip (W : H) ratio, interviewer measured circumference waist (2 cm umbilicus) hip (max- imal protrusion). On account medical logistic problems, waist and/or hip circumferences measured 25% colorectal cancer cases 19% control subjects [6]. An interviewer-administered food-frequency questionnaire (FFQ) including total energy. used assess subjects’ habitual diet, Average weekly frequency consumption foods food groups, well complex recipes two years prior cancer diagnosis hospital admission (for controls) elicited. The FFQ also included 15 questions aimed assessing individual fat intake pattern meal frequency. Satisfactory reproducibility [10, 11] validity [12] FFQ reported. To compute energy nutrient intake, Italian food-composition data base used [13]. Fiber, de¢ned non starch polysaccharides plus lignin, divided accord- ing type food originated (i.e., vegetables fruit cereals) [14^16]. The GI qualitative assessment foods based incremen- tal glucose response insulin demand produce given amount carbohydrates. We expressed GI percent glycemic response elicited white bread standard food. For case control subject, calculated daily average GI summing products carbohydrate content per serving food recipe, times average number servings food per week, times GI, divided total amount available carbohydrate weekly intake [17, 18]. A score daily average GL computed GI, without dividing total amount carbohydrates. For calculations used carbohydrate content 50 foods recipes since 28 foods recipes, chie£y meat- ¢sh-based ones cheese, contained negligible amount carbohydrates [13].

Assessment BMI W : H ratio colorectal cancer patients hampered weight loss proximity cancer diagnosis. We had, however, information BMI changes time, able allow recent weight loss [6]. In addition dietary ¢ndings, several lines evidence suggest role insulin colorectal carcinogenesis. Non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus associated increased risk colorectal cancer [32, 33]. Insulin considered growth factor shown increase insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I, involved long-term regulation energy metabolism [2]. Insulin IGF receptors found normal malignant cells colonic mucosa, stimulate proliferation human colorectal cells [2, 34]. Tall individuals [35] acromegaly, elevated levels growth hormone IGF-I [36], increased incidence colorectal cancer. Circu- lating levels IGF-I II IGF binding protein (IGF BP)-III, modulate access IGF-I IGF- receptors, related subsequent colorectal cancer risk [37, 38]. We used validated questionnaire [10, 12] access large number colorectal cancer patients control subjects who, vast majority, agreed participate study. The control group included broad range acute conditions unrelated diet modi¢- cations. Reported associations GI GL restricted major nosological category control, held true cases controls history diabetes excluded. Allowance possible number potential confounding factors, including number daily meals, energy alcohol intake, physical activity. Weaknesses present ¢ndings include, however, limitations current GI estimates. Many derived small samples variations estimates mixed-meal situations unclear [17,18]. Notwithstanding, present ¢ndings lend indirect support hypothesis increased glycemic response insulin resistance associated colorectal cancer, notably colon.

Taylor Background Methods Results The General Population Nutrition Intervention Trial randomized primary esophageal gastric cancer prevention trial conducted 1985 1991, 29 584 adult participants Linxian, China, given daily vitamin mineral supplements. Treatment “factor D,” combination 50 µ g selenium, 30 mg vitamin E, 15 mg beta-carotene, led decreased mortality causes, cancer overall , gastric cancer. Here, present 10-year follow-up end active intervention. Participants assessed periodic data collection, monthly visits village health workers, quar- terly review Linxian Cancer Registry. Hazard ratios (HRs) 95% confidence intervals (CIs) cumulative effects four vitamin mineral supplementation regimens calculated using adjusted proportional hazards models. Through May 31, 2001, 276 participants lost follow-up; 9727 died, including 3242 cancer (1515 esophageal cancer 1199 gastric cancer). Participants received factor D lower overall mortality (HR = 0.95, 95% CI = 0.91 0.99; P = .009; reduction cumulative mortality 33.62% 32.19%) gastric cancer mortality (HR = 0.89, 95% CI = 0.79 1.00; P = .043; reduction cumulative gastric cancer mortality 4.28% 3.84%) subjects receive factor D. Reductions mostly attributable benefits subjects younger 55 years. Esophageal cancer deaths receive factor D different overall; however, decreased 17% among participants younger 55 (HR = 0.83, 95% CI = 0.71 0.98; P = .025) increased 14% among aged 55 years older (HR = 1.14, 95% CI = 1.00 1.30; P = .47). Vitamin A zinc supplementation associated increased total stroke mortality; vitamin C molybdenum supplementation, decreased stroke mortality. Conclusion The beneficial effects selenium, vitamin E, beta-carotene mortality still evident 10 years cessation supplementation consistently greater younger participants. Late effects supplementation regimens also observed. J Natl Cancer Inst 2009;101: 507 – 518 With incidence rates exceeding 100 per 10 000 person-years, people Linxian, China, highest rates esopha- geal squamous cell carcinoma gastric cardia adenocarcinoma world ( 1 , 2 ). Several studies early 1980s showed nutritional deficiencies common area, suggesting link deficiencies high cancer rates ( 3 ). The Linxian General Population Nutrition Intervention Trial (NIT), large-scale, randomized, double-blind, primary prevention trial, designed test efficacy four combinations vitamins minerals reducing esophageal gastric cardia cancer incidence mortality Linxian ( 4 – 6 ). The results trial, started March 1, 1986, concluded May 31, 1991, showed supplementation antioxidant combination selenium, vitamin E, beta-carotene statistically significantly reduced total mortality, total cancer mortality, gastric cancer mortality ( 5 ). The identification statistically significant effects raises questions durability effects also potential good bad late effects related supplementation.

In General Population Nutrition Intervention Trial 1985 – 1991, 29 584 Linxian villagers aged 40 – 69 years given daily supplements one four vitamin mineral combinations. “Factor D,” contained selenium, vitamin E, beta-carotene, associated reduced mortality overall, cancer, gastric cancer. Study design For 15-year follow-up, villagers interviewed monthly concern- ing health registered cancer deaths reviewed look sustained delayed effects vitamin supplements. Hazard ratios death cancer, stroke causes calculated four supplement combinations. Contribution Ten years end trial, participants took factor D still 5% reduction total mortality 11% reduction gastric cancer; effects concentrated among participants younger 55 years. Esophageal cancer decreased 17% par- ticipants younger 55 years, increased 14% older 55 years. Implications Sustained benefits associated combination sele- nium, vitamin E, beta-carotene supplementation. More subtle long-term effects also observed vitamin supplements. Limitations It known items supplement combination responsible combined effect. Because study pre- formed nutritionally deprived population high rates esophageal gastric cancer, findings might applica- ble populations. It possible findings could biased general improvement nutrition among partici- pants postintervention period. From Editors Since conclusion active trial treatment 1991, follow-up continued participants collect data cancer inci- dence all-cause mortality. Here report mortality results total 15.25 years trial posttrial follow-up (through May 31, 2001) original priori trial endpoints, is, effects intervention agents esophageal gastric cardia cancer mortality, all-cause mortality. Subjects Methods Design Trial Posttrial Follow-up The design conduct Linxian General Population NIT extended follow-up described elsewhere ( 4 – 6 ). In brief, participants recruited 1985 four northern com- munes Linxian, rural county Henan Province. Residents 40 – 69 years age history cancer debilitating disease eligible trial asked enroll. In all, 29 584 subjects, 60% invited, randomly assigned trial. These individuals interviewed medical history, family his- tory cancer, diet, alcohol tobacco consumption; given brief medical exam; asked donate 10-mL blood sample. The nine nutrients studied trial daily doses retinol (5000 IU, retinol palmitate), zinc (22.5 mg, zinc oxide), riboﬂ avin (3.2 mg), niacin (40 mg), ascorbic acid (120 mg), molybdenum (30 µ g, molybdenum yeast complex), selenium (50 µ g, selenium yeast), alpha-tocopherol (30 mg), beta- carotene (15 mg). Doses ranged one two times US Rec- ommended Daily Allowances. An independent study nutrients vitamins, although desirable, practical. Therefore, nine nutrients combined four regimens factors: retinol zinc (factor A); riboﬂ avin niacin (factor B); vitamin C molybdenum (factor C); selenium, vitamin E, beta-carotene (factor D). The trial one-half 2 4 fractional factorial design, partici- pants randomly assigned computer-generated random numbers list take one eight combinations four factors. These eight intervention groups (treatment arms) deﬁ ned following combinations factors: ABCD, AB, AC, AD, BC, BD, CD, placebo. With design, half subjects received half receive four factors (eg, half received half receive factor A). Supplements distributed coded pill bottles March 1, 1986, May 1, 1991. Throughout trial, pill codes kept secured ﬁ le study data management center United States available study data manager. During trial period, village health workers visited participants monthly deliver pills, assess pill compliance, ascertain vital disease status. Diagnostic materials (case records, pathology slides, X-rays) 85% cancer cases trial period available reviewed panel American Chinese experts. In subsequent 10 years posttrial, village health workers study interviewers continued contact participants monthly. For new cancer diagnoses deaths, diagnostic materi- als collected cancer diagnoses veriﬁ ed panel American Chinese experts (1991 1996) senior Chinese diagnosticians Beijing (1996 – 2001). Throughout trial posttrial follow-up, case ascertainment considered com- plete loss follow-up minimal (n = 276, <1%). Outcomes study based data full 15.25 years follow-up, March 1, 1986 (the start intervention), May 31, 2001 (10 years intervention ended). Due delayed ascertainment outcomes, number deaths reported intervention period higher original report. Compliance, measured pill disappearance rates bio- chemical measurements, excellent.

Participants cen- sored last known follow-up date, date death, administrative closure follow-up study (May 31, 2001), whichever came first. The 15.25-year follow-up period ana- lyzed whole three 5-year periods: trial period (March 1, 1986, May 31, 1991) intervention agents given two periods (June 1, 1991, May 31, 1996, June 1, 1996, May 31, 2001) active follow-up contin- ued additional intervention performed. Among cancers, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma gastric cardia adenocarcinoma occur epidemic rates population, share etiologic risk factors, widespread use endoscopy biopsy, diagnosed single disease referred “esophageal cancer” “hard swallowing disease” ( 7 ). Through 2001, esophageal adenocarcinoma nonexistent Linxian. We present data effects supplements mortality esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, gastric cardia adenocarcinoma, gastric noncardia adenocarcinoma, com- bination esophageal gastric cardia cancer (the original hard swallowing disease). We tabulated baseline frequencies percentages partici- pants demographics. We compared risk received factor not. In analysis facto- rial trials, kind analysis known “at margins analysis” power examine effect factor ( 8 ). Cox proportional hazards models used calculate hazard ratios (HRs) 95% conﬁ dence intervals (95% CIs) fac- tor, adjusting three treatment factors, sex, age (con- tinuous), commune (four communes). These analyses conducted 29 559 29 584 initial study participants; 25 lost follow-up intervention began ( Figure 1 ).

This increased risk mainly due effect factor A noncancer deaths: The hazard ratio cere- brovascular deaths 1.08 (95% CI = 1.00 1.16; P = .045) causes death 1.06 (95% CI = 0.99 1.13; P = .088).

Cumulative crude gastric cancer mortality subjects 4.28% – factor D group compared 3.84% factor D group, overall reduction 0.44%. For esophageal cancer mortality, effect modiﬁ cation age even pronounced. There overall association factor D esophageal cancer mortality subjects (HR = 1.01, 95% CI = .91 1.11; P = .905); however, subjects younger 55 years, factor D esophageal cancer mortality decreased (HR = 0.83, 95% CI = 0.71 0.98; P = .025), whereas individuals aged 55 years older, increased (HR = 1.14, 95% CI = 1.00 1.30; P = .047) ( Table 3 ). Discussion The initial results Linxian General Population NIT, pub- lished 1993, showed association factors A, B, C overall mortality, total cancer mortality, mortality esophageal gastric cancers ( 5 ). However, factor D, included selenium, vitamin E, beta-carotene, statistically sig- nificantly reduced total mortality, total cancer mortality, mor- tality gastric cancer ( 5 ). An important question remained, however, whether preventive effects factor D would last beyond trial period. The results continued follow-up show hazard ratios, indicated moving hazard ratio curves, remained less 1.0 endpoints majority follow-up period; 10 years completion trial, group received factor D still showed 5% reduction total mortality 11% reduction gastric cancer mortality. Overall, one 70 people took factor D spared death causes, one 227 spared death gastric cancer. Stratiﬁ cation results sex age planned priori. There statistically signiﬁ cant interactions sex. However, stratiﬁ ed age, factor D strong protective effect individuals younger 55 years almost effect subjects aged 55 years older. This pattern seen consistently total mortality, total cancer mortality, gastric cancer mortality, esophageal cancer mortality.

Year gastrointestinal tract cancers developed interven- tion period showed inverse associations risk esophageal cancer baseline serum levels selenium alpha-tocopherol, beta-carotene ( 13 – 15 ). Higher baseline serum selenium also associated reduced risk gastric cardia cancer ( 13 ). These results suggest protective effects seen ran- domized trial due selenium vitamin E components. In subcohort 1103 subjects trial followed May 31, 2001, higher baseline serum selenium levels also associated statistically signiﬁ cant reductions esophageal gastric cardia cancer mortality ( 16 ). A separate randomized controlled trial Linxian ( 17 ) gave support preven- tive effect selenium subjects preexisting esophageal squamous dysplasia, precursor lesion esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. Compared control subjects, mild dysplasia received 10 months daily supplementation 200 µ g selenomethionine likely regression less likely progression esophageal squamous dysplasia. In addition evaluating durability beneﬁ cial effects observed trial period factor D, also evaluated postintervention events trial look late effects, several noted. When full 15.25 years follow-up considered, nutritional supplementation factor A (vitamin A zinc) associated increased total mortality, mainly due increase stroke deaths among subjects given factor A compared given factor A, whereas supplementation factor C (vitamin C molybde- num) associated decrease stroke deaths slight increase esophageal/cardia cancer deaths. Increased mortality among factor A recipients expected, given low retinol levels population start trial, modest doses vitamin A zinc, gener- ally null protective results previous observational studies cohort relating high serum retinol tissue zinc concen- trations various cancer endpoints ( 15 , 18 ). In fact, previous analysis stroke (the main contributor observed increase total mortality) trial showed protective effect persons took combination factor A factor D (HR = 0.71, 95% CI = 0.50 1.00, group AD vs placebo) ( 19 ). We surprised factor C, combination vitamin C molybdenum, appeared associated increased risk combined esophageal cardia cancer endpoint, given well-known role vitamin C antioxidant inhibitor carcinogenic N -nitroso compound production stomach ( 20 ). Furthermore, many epidemiological studies shown reduced risk cancers persons high consumption fruits vegetables rich sources vitamin C, pro- spective study plasma vitamin C gastric cancer showed protective effect high concentrations ( 21 ).

Higher plasma vita- min C levels associated reduced risk stroke prospective epidemiological studies ( 22 – 24 ), although randomized trials included vitamin C part antioxidant vitamin treatment arm shown effect ( 25 , 26 ). There data molybdenum stroke. The effects vitamin mineral supplements reduction total mortality cancer mortality heavily debated past 25 years. The results study need inter- preted context trials vitamin mineral supple- mentation. By 1980s, established antioxidants could quench free oxygen radicals potentially reduce risk can- cer preventing DNA damage radicals. Observational epidemiological studies showed inverse associations can- cer incidence dietary intake several vitamins minerals, deﬁ nitive evidence awaited completion random- ized trials ( 27 ). It generally assumed prescribing pills would convenient acceptable way prevent cancer proscribing carcinogens. These facts assumptions moti- vated design conduct ﬁ rst generation randomized controlled cancer prevention trials, including Linxian General Population NIT, reduce cancer risk using vitamins miner- als. The results largest informative trials (ie, 10 000 participants) often contrary initial expectations. Beta-carotene supplementation increased total mortality Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene (ATBC) Cancer Prevention Study ( 28 ) beta-CArotene Retinol Efﬁ cacy Trial (CARET) Study ( 29 ), whereas mortality beneﬁ beta-carotene seen either The Physicians ’ Health Study (PHS) ( 30 ) Women ’ Health Study ( 31 ). The likely explanation unexpected ﬁ ndings four large trials conducted West mismatch design trials population attributes: trials tested pharmacological doses micronutrients already well-nourished populations ( 32 ). A recent meta-analysis randomized trials antioxidant sup- plements prevention cancer diseases ( 33 ) com- bined results large-scale studies many smaller studies concluded treatment beta-carotene, vitamin A, vitamin E likely increased total mortality, effect vita- min C selenium total mortality needed study. The results study agree part meta-analysis conclu- sions. In trial, factor A (which included vitamin A) increased mortality, factor C (which included vitamin C) associated overall mortality, factor D (which included selenium) decreased mortality. However, beta-carotene vitamin E, two supplements associated increased mortality risk meta-analysis, factor D, reduced mortality trial. Several potential explanations exist apparently discrepant results. First, protective effect selenium may stronger possible deleterious effects beta-carotene jnci.oxfordjournals.org JNCI | Articles 515 vitamin E trial, overall effect factor D beneﬁ cial. This hypothesis supported medium-sized trials shown beneﬁ cial effects selenium reducing mortal- ity cancer risk ( 34 – 36 ). A second possible explanation discrepancies baseline nutritional status populations studied inﬂ uenced supplementation effects. The people Linxian nutrition- ally deﬁ cient ( 3 , 37 ), vitamin mineral supplements may beneﬁ cial populations studied. The results Dysplasia NIT ( 38 ), medium-sized randomized nutrition intervention trial conducted among subjects cytologically diagnosed esophageal squamous dyspla- sia Linxian time General Population NIT, showed supplementation 26 minerals vitamins associated non – statistically signiﬁ cant 7% reduction mor- tality risk. Results Nutritional Prevention Cancer Trial showed beneﬁ ts selenium supplementation total cancer mortality ( 39 ) development prostate cancer ( 36 ) essentially limited participants lower selenium levels start trial. Further support hypothesis comes data meta-analysis antioxidant supplement trials total mortality ( 33 ). We classiﬁ ed 68 study popula- tions included analysis Western (n = 58), East Asian (n = 8), (n = 2) found statistically signiﬁ cant heterogeneity results studies performed Western East Asian populations. The Western studies combined odds ratio (OR) 1.04 (95% CI = 1.01 1.06) East Asian studies combined OR 0.92 (95% CI = 0.84 1.02) ( ␹ 2 het- erogeneity P = .02). Because nearly events East Asian group came Linxian, know borderline deﬁ cient nutrition, difference meta-analysis results may well reﬂ ect differences baseline nutritional status popula- tions evaluated. A third possible explanation heterogeneity results observed among studies evaluated association vita- min supplements total mortality gastrointestinal cancer risk effect modiﬁ cation stage disease study entry. Our results show individuals younger 55 years beneﬁ ted factor D. This result may indicate greater beneﬁ earlier course carcinogenesis consistent “point return,” beyond supplementation vitamins useful may harmful, preferentially beneﬁ ting developing tumor host. This hypothesis may help explain observational studies, reﬂ ect long-term intake vitamins vitamin-containing fruits vegetables, usually shown beneﬁ cial associations, whereas trials, largely conducted older patients, sometimes shown harmful effects vitamin interventions. Participants ATBC CARET studies, addition older Linxian general population trial (ages 50 – 69 years ATBC 45 – 74 years CARET), heavy smokers exposed asbestos, powerful carci- nogenic exposures may put beyond point disease process could beneﬁ supplements. Detailed analyses studies shown increased risk associated vitamin use almost exclusively seen current (as opposed former) smokers ( 40 ) smoked ( 41 ). In contrast, PHS study, included fewer 10% smokers, showed adverse effect beta-carotene ( 30 ). In addition report, three cancer prevention nutri- tion intervention trials reported results continued follow-up termination intervention. Follow-up participants ATBC Study 8 years end intervention showed harmful effects beta- carotene (ie, increased total mortality lung cancer incidence) beneﬁ cial effect vitamin E (ie, decreased prostate cancer incidence) disappeared, albeit slowly ( 42 ). However, analyses cerebral infarcts (80% strokes) among vitamin E recipients ATBC Study showed reversed effects trial (relative risk [RR] = 0.86, 95% CI = 0.75 0.99) ( 43 ) 6 years post- trial (RR = 1.13, 95% CI = 1.00 1.27) ( 44 ). After 6 years postintervention follow-up CARET study, relative risk total mortality remained greater 1.0, elevated risk diminished longer statistically signiﬁ cant ( 45 ). Lung cancer mortality, however, still statistically signiﬁ cantly increased. The Calcium Polyp Prevention Trial reported protective effect calcium supplementation colorectal ade- noma recurrence found trial period (RR = 0.81, 95% CI = 0.74 0.98) ( 46 ) continued 5 years supplementa- tion ended was, anything, stronger intervention (RR = 0.63, 95% CI = 0.46 0.87) ( 47 ). Durability cancer prevention effects cessation inter- vention also observed nonnutritional agents. In fact, consistent example sustained cancer prevention effect reported date cancer prevention agent tested trials tamoxifen primary prevention breast cancer. Posttrial follow-up three tamoxifen trials ( 48 – 50 ) consis- tently found beneﬁ conclusion active treatment, one trial ( 50 ), statistically signiﬁ cant reduction risk (among patients estrogen receptor-positive tumors) seen treatment ceased. This study several strengths. It randomized double- blind design excellent compliance long-term follow-up virtually complete ascertainment cases well-deﬁ ned population. This study also limitations. Interventions factors con- taining multiple agents allow evaluation effects individual agents alone, able evaluate one dose agents supplemented. The people Linxian deﬁ cient many micronutrients, may limit generalizability results well-nourished populations. If protective effects study due replacement essen- tial nutrients nutritionally deprived population, similar interventions might useful similarly deprived populations West, including United States, although populations low rates esophageal gastric cancer mortality unlikely avert many deaths high-rate populations Linxian. Finally, smoothed hazard ratios presented intended provide alternative visual representation effects speciﬁ c points time complement cumulative view offered Kaplan – Meier curves. These smoothed hazard ratios interpreted caution, however, conﬁ dence intervals around curves nearly always include 1.0. Thus, curves affected play chance may 516 Articles | JNCI Vol. 101, Issue 7 | April 1, 2009 biased choice smoothing parameters, edge effects, factors. It noted follow-up period occurred time dramatic economic progress China whole. Although documented improvements dietary intakes Linxian follow-up modest ( 37 ), substantial undocumented changes almost certainly occurred. Effects dietary improve- ments evenly distributed across participants various randomized treatment groups trial. Thus, effects supplements dietary micronutrient intake additive, dietary changes might occurred bias treatment group effects postintervention period. If instead beneﬁ supplementation correct deﬁ - ciency state exceed minimum required threshold, then, people started become less deﬁ cient dietary improvements time, observed treatment effects would expected weaken. It remarkable beneﬁ ts persisted despite likely improved nutrition attendant attenuation treatment effects. It also possible improved diet may modiﬁ ed effects postintervention period, including enhanced beneﬁ widely observed younger partici- pants emergence late effects, notably beneﬁ factor C cerebrovascular deaths. In summary, 10 years postintervention follow-up partici- pants cancer prevention trial demonstrated durability previously observed beneﬁ cial effects mortality supple- mentation selenium, vitamin E, beta-carotene. The per- sistence risk reduction 10 years treatment trial reinforces validity original trial ﬁ ndings con- sistent emerging new paradigm cancer prevention, namely, prevention may achievable short-term opposed life-long treatment. Striking age interactions seen, suggesting supplements may beneﬁ cial younger age groups.

KEY WORDS: ● white meat ● red meat ● cancer ● colon ● N-nitroso compounds Up 80% colorectal cancer cases attributed diet, suggesting cancer, second common Western countries, preventable disease (1). Armstrong Doll (2) attributed much international variation large bowel cancer incidence among countries dietary dif- ferences, especially meat fat consumption. If meat associated increased risk, lower rates cancer would expected vegetarians; meta-analysis ﬁve cohorts, non–meat eaters lower risk meat eaters (3).

Objective To assess whether major increase vegetable, fruit, fiber intake decrease dietary fat intake reduces risk recurrent new primary breast cancer all-cause mortality among women previously treated early stage breast cancer. Design, Setting, Participants Multi-institutional randomized controlled trial dietary change 3088 women previously treated early stage breast cancer 18 70 years old diagnosis. Women enrolled 1995 2000 followed June 1, 2006. Intervention The intervention group (n=1537) randomly assigned receive telephone counseling program supplemented cooking classes newsletters promoted daily targets 5 vegetable servings plus 16 oz vegetable juice; 3 fruit serv- ings; 30 g fiber; 15% 20% energy intake fat. The comparison group (n=1551) provided print materials describing “5-A-Day” dietary guidelines. Main Outcome Measures Invasive breast cancer event (recurrence new pri- mary) death cause.

Epidemiological experimental evidence supports hypothesis heme iron present meat promotes colorectal cancer. This meta-analysis prospective cohort studies colon cancer reporting heme intake included 566,607 individuals 4,734 cases colon cancer. The relative risk colon cancer 1.18 (95% CI: 1.06–1.32) subjects highest category heme iron intake compared lowest category. Epidemiological data thus show suggestive association dietary heme risk colon cancer. The analysis experimental studies rats chemically-induced colon cancer showed dietary hemoglobin red meat consistently promote aberrant crypt foci, putative precancer lesion. The mechanism known, heme iron catalytic effect (i) endogenous formation carcinogenic N-nitroso compounds (ii) formation cytotoxic genotoxic aldehydes lipoperoxidation. A review evidence supporting hypotheses suggests pathways involved heme iron toxicity. Cancer Prev Res; 4(2); 177–84. Ó2011 AACR.

First, meat cooked high temperature contains mutagenic heterocyclic amines. But heterocyclic amines might major players CRC risk, as: (i) consumption chicken major contributor intake heterocyclic amines, associated risk (6); (ii) doses heterocyclic amines induce cancer animals 1,000 100,000 times higher dose ingested humans (7). A second hypothesis suggests high saturated fat content red processed meat increases risk CRC. But several including recent meta-analysis, showed studies, effect saturated fat colorectal carcinogenesis (8–11). A third hypothesis concerns carcinogenic N-nitroso compounds (NOC), formed gastrointestinal tract N-nitrosation peptide derived amines amides. The role NOC human cancer discussed following text. Other unlikely hypotheses involve high protein, cholesterol, salt content red processed meat. For review mechanisms, see ref. 12. Sesink colleagues suggested heme iron, form hemin [chloroprotoporphyrin IX iron(III)] ferric form heme, may explain link risk colon cancer red meat intake, lack link white meat intake (13). Epidemiological experi- mental evidence support heme toxicity. Heme consists iron atom present center large heterocyclic organic ring called porphyrin (Fig. 1). Heme included so-called hemoprotein, is, hemoglobin, myoglobin (both involved oxygen supply), cytochromes (which catalyze electron transfer reactions).

In processed red meat, heme iron nitrosylated, curing salt contains nitrate nitrite (Fig. 1; ref. 12). The aims present mini-review were: (i) conduct meta-analysis epidemiological cohort studies heme intake risk colon cancer; (ii) review experi- mental evidence supporting aforementioned heme hypothesis; (iii) understand mechanism action heme carcinogenesis. Heme iron intake risk colon cancer: meta-analysis prospective cohort studies magnitude The objective part review assess, meta-analysis, relation heme iron intake colon cancer. As studies report data rectal cancer, decided limit analysis colon cancer. The methodological procedure described Supplementary Material article.

This study pursued future prospective cohort studies, epidemiological result line experimental vivo results detailed following text. Experimental evidence colorectal cancer promotion heme iron Sawa colleagues showed dietary hemoglobin produces lipid peroxyl radicals increases inci- dence nitrosomethylurea-induced colon cancer rats fed polyunsaturated fat (24). Sesink colleagues studied effect hemin-supplemented diet non- initiated rats. Dietary hemin increases fat peroxidation cytotoxic activity fecal water, epithelial pro- liferation 70% (13). In hemin, iron atom stabilized freely exchangeable chloride. Pierre colleagues also showed hemin hemoglobin increase number azoxymethane-induced aberrant crypt foci, putative preneoplastic lesions, colon rats (21). In contrast hemin, dietary hemoglobin increase cytotoxicity fecal water, less potent hemin promoting colon carcinogenesis. Hemoglobin may suitable substitute myoglobin nutritional experiments animal model, model agent studies cytotoxicity red meat (21). Pierre colleagues also fed 3 types meat different heme content (chicken, beef, blood sausage) rats treated azoxymethane fed low-calcium diet (25). This study first show dietary meat promote colon carcinogenesis, effect depends heme concentration. The results study meat contrast several earlier studies, red-meat based high-calcium diets failed promote colon carcinogenesis, indicating probable protection calcium (26). Subsequently, Pierre colleagues tested hypothesis, suggested epidemiology, nitrosyl heme processed meat toxic native heme fresh meat (27). Cured meat indeed promote colon carcinogenesis rats (27). Dietary hemin, hemo- globin, could used model agent mimic effects processed meat rats (27).

In addition, mice fed diet hot-dogs (18%), 4 5 times ATNC, mice fed beef diet 2 3 times ATNC feces controls fed meat (33, 34). Human volunteers given high red meat diet excreted much ATNC stools controls given little red meat, white meat (31, 35, 36). The fecal concentration ATNC 60 times higher volunteers given cured red meat volunteers given vegetarian diet (37).

By contrast, However, several arguments suggest ATNC may important genotoxins. First, NOC, nitrosa- mines, nitrosamides, nitrosoguanidines, yield alkylating agents metabolism, cause DNA damage. For instance N-methyl-N-nitrosurea intrarectally perfused induced G ! A transitions K-ras 30% rat colon carcinoma (43). In addition, nitrosated glycine deri- vatives reacted DNA give rise promutagenic toxic adducts including O6-methylguanine O6-carbox- ymethylguanine (44). O6-Carboxymethylguanine adducts found stool exfoliated colonocytes volunteers eating red meat, correlation level adducts fecal ATNC, suggesting ATNC genotoxic (45).

Moreover, endogenous formation ATNC inhibited vitamins C E, lipoperoxidation inhibited several polyphenols quercetin, a-tocopherol, red wine polyphenols (64– 68).

The dietary recommendations reduce red meat intake avoid processed meat intake (1). However, meat important source proteins, pro- viding essential amino acids, excellent source iron zinc. Iron deficiency widespread nutritional disorder world, especially among children premenopausal women, results iron deficiency anemia (1). Knowledge mechan- ism CRC promotion meat may allow alternative prevention strategy developed: inhibiting red processed meat toxicity instead stopping meat intake. Among hypotheses explaining association meat intake risk CRC, effect heme iron supported epidemiological (Fig. 2) experimental evidence (Supplementary Fig. S1). Sev- eral mechanisms may explain effect heme CRC, 2 major hypotheses are: (i) heme catalyzes endogenous formation ATNC; (ii) heme catalyzes peroxidation dietary fats (Fig. 3). Calcium salts, chlorophyll, vitamin C, several polyphenols may reduce deleterious effects heme. Specific recom- mendations might made, example, "eat yogurt steak." Moreover, vitamins polyphenols could added curing process. Ascorbic acid already added processing processed meats specifically inhibit formation volatile NOC meat (69). We expect reduce risk CRC without losing benefit pleasure eating meat. Disclosure Potential Conflicts Interests No potential conflicts interests disclosed.

We carried randomized, prospective, multicenter clinical trial test effect dietary intervention designed reduce fat intake women resected, early-stage breast cancer receiving conventional cancer management. Methods: A total 2437 women randomly assigned February 1994 January 2001 ratio 40 : 60 dietary intervention (n = 975) control (n = 1462) groups. An interim analysis performed median follow- 60 months funding intervention ceased. Mean differences dietary intervention control groups nutrient intakes anthropometric variables compared tests. Relapse-free survival exam- ined using Kaplan – Meier analysis, stratiﬁ ed log-rank tests, Cox proportional hazards models. Statistical tests two-sided. Results: Dietary fat intake lower inter- vention control group (fat grams/day 12 months, 33.3 [95% conﬁ dence interval {CI} = 32.2 34.5] versus 51.3 [95% CI = 50.0 52.7], respectively; P <.001), corresponding statistically signiﬁ cant ( P = .005), 6-pound lower mean body weight intervention group.

Exploratory analyses suggested differential effect dietary inter- vention based hormonal receptor status. Conclusions: A lifestyle intervention reducing dietary fat intake, mod- est inﬂ uence body weight, may improve relapse-free sur- vival breast cancer patients ceiving conventional cancer management. Longer, ongoing nonintervention follow-up address original protocol design plans, called 3 years follow-up completion recruitment. [J Natl Cancer Inst 2006;98: 1767 – 76 ] The question inﬂ uence dietary fat breast cancer controversial. Whereas preclinical human ecologic studies suggested association higher di- etary fat intake breast cancer risk ( 1 , 2 ) , cohort studies reported less consistent effects ( 3 – 5 ) . Similarly, observa- tional studies dietary fat inﬂ uence breast cancer recur- rence mixed results ( 6 , 7 ) , suggesting higher fat intake associated higher risk recurrence, especially postmenopausal women ( 8 – 10 ) . The varying as- sociations may due modest range fat intake seen difﬁ culty accurately measuring fat intake cur- rent methods ( 11 , 12 ) .

P ATIENTS AND M ETHODS Study Overview In phase III multicenter randomized trial, effect relapse dietary intervention designed reduce fat intake compared control condition minimal dietary counseling women early-stage, resected breast cancer receiving conventional cancer management. Patients study accrued approximately 7 years, February 1994 January 2001. This report represents interim analysis median 60 months follow-up. The WINS trial protocol available online supplementary data http://jncicancerspectrum.oxfordjournals.org/jnci/content/ vol98/issue24 . Study Population Women recruited 39 clinical centers. Eligibility criteria included histologically conﬁ rmed, resected, unilateral invasive breast carcinoma; lymph node evaluation; age 48 79 years; life expectancy least 10 years excluding cancer diagnosis; acceptable adjuvant systemic therapy (see below); least 20% calories obtained fat; medically able accept either randomization assignment; trial entry within 365 days surgery. Exclusion criteria included inﬂ am- matory carcinoma; chest wall skin involved; tumor size less 1 cm negative nodes; tumor size greater 5 cm positive nodes; 10 nodes positive; preoperative chemo- therapy; previous neoplasm carcinoma situ cervix basal cell skin carcinoma. Eligibility con- ﬁ rmed central review medical records pathology re- ports. The Institutional Review Board participating institution approved study protocol. All patients gave written informed consent. Standard Breast Cancer Management Standard breast cancer management protocol de ﬁ ned, including adequate surgery radiotherapy. Estrogen receptor (ER) progesterone receptor (PgR) status (positive negative) deﬁ ned local laboratory standards. Women ER-positive tumors received tamoxifen (20 mg per day) 5 years. Chemotherapy protocol-approved regimen (adria- mycin plus cyclophosphamide; cyclophosphamide plus metho- trexate plus 5-ﬂ uorouracil two schedules; 5-ﬂ uorouracil plus adriamycin plus cyclophosphamide two schedules [5- ﬂ uoruracil – adriamycin – cyclophosphamide cyclophosphamide – adriamycin – fluorouracil]; adriamycin – cyclophosphamide followed paclitaxel) required women ER- negative tumors optional ER-positive tumors. As eligibility criterion, chemotherapy initiated within 4 months diagnosis women given chemotherapy, tamoxifen initiated within 6 months diagnosis given tamoxifen. Recommended drug dosages schedules paralleled use cooperative group trials time ( 15 – 17 ). Randomization Adaptive randomization carried Statistical Co- ordinating Unit WINS study using random stratiﬁ ed per- muted block design. The trial designed unbalanced randomization (60% control subjects, 40% dietary intervention subjects) facilitate resource allocation dietary interven- tion. Women initially stratiﬁ ed according lymph node status (negative positive) systemic adjuvant therapy received (tamoxifen alone, tamoxifen plus chemotherapy, chemotherapy alone). An additional stratum sentinel node evaluation (yes no) introduced 1999 reﬂ ect clinical practice trends. Dietary Intervention Study Assessments The goal dietary intervention reduce percentage calories fat 15% maintaining nutritional adequacy. Feasibility studies indicated goal would result sustained reduction fat intake approximately 20% calories ( 14 ) , basis sample size calcula- tion. Women dietary intervention group given individual fat gram goal counseled registered dieticians implemented previously developed low-fat eating plan ( 14 – 18 ) . Study dieticians trained centrally diet inter- vention dietary anthropometric data collection. Training continued annual workshops incorporating training mo- tivational interviewing monthly conference calls. The low-fat eating plan, based nutritional behavioral science principles ( 18 ) , incorporated social cognitive theory included self-monitoring (fat gram counting re- cording), goal setting, modeling, social support, relapse pre- vention management. Individual fat gram goals based energy intake needed maintain weight, counseling weight reduction provided. The low-fat eating plan initiated eight biweekly individual, in-person counseling sessions, lasting approximately 1 hour. Subsequent dietician contacts (visits calls) occurred every 3 months, available, optional monthly dietary group sessions. Women dietary intervention group instructed keep written record fat gram intake daily throughout trial using previously developed “ keeping score ” book ( 18 ) . Control subjects one baseline dietician visit contacts dietician every 3 months subsequently. They received written information general dietary guidelines counseled nutritional adequacy vitamin mineral intake only. Questionnaires administered baseline used collect information demographic characteristics; medical, reproduc- tive, family history; personal habits smoking alcohol use; prior use menopausal hormone therapy oral contraceptives; current use medications dietary supplements. Weight height measured baseline annually using standardized techniques calibrated scales/stadi- ometer ( 19 ) . Body mass index (BMI) calculated weight (in kilograms) divided height (in meters) squared. Unannounced telephone calls used estimate dietary intakes. Trained interviewers blinded randomization status collected dietary information; information entered Nutrition Data System Research interactive software previously described ( 18 ) . A multilayered quality control process used maintain nutrition data quality ( 20 ) .

Two additional follow-up calls (including one weekend day) made annually collect updated data dietary intakes women. Recurrence information solicited every-3- month dietician contacts. Recurrences conﬁ rmed initially medical record pathology report review clinical director (RTC) subsequently WINS Pathology Committee, blinded random assignment. Outcome Deﬁ nitions The primary study endpoint relapse-free survival, deﬁ ned time random assignment breast cancer recurrence site. Relapse events included local, regional, distant recurrence; ipsilateral breast recurrence lumpectomy; contralateral breast cancer. Overall survival, deﬁ ned time randomization death cause, secondary endpoint. For comparability adjuvant trials ( 15 , 21 – 24 ) , disease-free survival recurrence-free survival also examined. Disease-free survival events included secondary invasive cancers, excluding basal squamous skin cancers, death without breast cancer recurrence. Recurrence-free survival events included local, regional, distant, ipsilateral breast recurrence lumpectomy excluded contralateral breast cancer. Breast cancer size nodal status used calculate tumor size – node – metastasis stage ( 25 ) baseline. Termination Dietary Intervention WINS supported multicenter RO1 grant National Cancer Institute, continued funding dependent ongoing peer review. Funding clinical centers active dietary intervention ended May 2004, even though protocol-deﬁ ned follow-up period completed even though secular trends therapy reduced recurrence events compared number events projected time study designed. The WINS External Advisory Commit- tee reviewed results last (November 2003) interim analysis (which incorporated nutrient data August 31, 2003, available efﬁ cacy data October 31, 2003), median follow-up 60 months. Based change trial status, WINS External Advisory Committee WINS Executive Committee supported reporting available results recognized need additional follow-up. These results presented American Society Clinical Oncol- ogy annual meeting ( 26 ) May 17, 2005, provided study participants mail. This interim efﬁ cacy report provides details dataset. The protocol design called 3 years follow-up completion recruitment January 2004. Currently ongoing nonintervention follow-up address original design plans. Statistical Analysis Sample size based model generated power esti- mates via simulation. Using published information cooper- ative group trials involving tamoxifen ( 27 , 28 ), calculated total sample size 2502 assumptions 6 years ac- crual, 3 years follow-up completion accrual, 7.5% increase relapse-free survival drop-in (deﬁ ned control group women intake <20% calories fat interval study) rate 10% drop-out rate 30% 84% power two-sided alpha level .05. The primary efﬁ cacy analysis stratiﬁ ed log-rank test. Exploratory Cox proportional hazards models relapse-free survival investigated, various Cox models prognostic factors addition used stratiﬁ ed randomization. The ﬁ nal Cox model included randomized group, stratiﬁ cation factors (ER status [positive versus negative] tumor size [<2 versus ≥ 2 cm]), surgery type (mastectomy versus lumpectomy) based established inﬂ uences breast cancer outcomes. The cumulative incidence method applied Cox model analyses. Model assessment suggested reasonable data ﬁ t. The assumption proportionality Cox models veriﬁ ed graphical numerical methods Lin et al. ( 29 ) . The P value Kolmogorov-type supremum test (for group) based 1000 simulations 0.5170, supporting proportional hazards assumptions. Analyses included randomly assigned patients, following intent-to-treat paradigm. All P values derived two-sided test signiﬁ cance. The 95% conﬁ dence interval (CI) hazard ratio (HR) obtained term ﬁ nal Cox model, particular attention interaction be- tween treatment factors model. The P values conﬁ dence intervals exploratory. Five protocol-planned in- terim analyses carried February 2000 November 2003. The Haybitle – Peto approach α -spending function used account interim analyses ( 30 ) . The Kaplan – Meier method used calculate probability estimates relapse-free overall survival.

R ESULTS A total 2437 apparently eligible women randomly assigned, 975 dietary intervention group 1462 control group ( Fig. 1 ). Thirty-four women (12 dietary group 22 control group) subsequently found ineligible, commonly based longer interval diagnosis and/or use chemotherapy (n = 10), pagetoid nipple involvement (n = 9), size margin issues (n = 5). However, randomly assigned patients included pre- sented analyses. The characteristics participants well balanced across two groups ( Table 1 ). The characteristics breast cancers study participants therapy given cancers treatment group provided Table 2 . Breast can- cer characteristics closely comparable two groups. Breast cancer therapy also closely comparable two groups, except type primary surgery. More women dietary intervention compared control group mastec- tomy rather breast-conserving therapy ( P = .004).

The reported dietary intake differ- ences randomization group time outlined Table 3 . In all, 80% women provided dietary data least three time periods baseline. After 1 year, mean daily fat gram intake slightly reduced control group (from 56.3 g baseline 51.3 g 12 months, mean difference = − 5.09 g, 95% CI = − 6.5 − 3.7, P <.0001) reduced statisti- cally signiﬁ cantly greater extent dietary intervention group (from 57.3 g baseline 33.3 g 12 months, mean difference = − 24.4 g, 95% CI = − 26.1 − 22.6, P <.0001; P <.001 comparing mean difference groups). The difference fat gram intake maintained 5 years (difference fat grams per day dietary versus control groups − 18.0 g [95% CI = − 19.9 − 16.1] 12 months − 19.0 g [95% CI = − 22.1 − 16.0] 60 months [both P <.0001]). Sim- ilar differences seen fat categories percent- age calories fat ( Table 3 ). In addition, energy intake somewhat lower ﬁ ber intake slightly higher inter- vention group participants ( Table 3 ).

To facilitate comparison study others, included death without breast cancer recurrence second primary can- cers events additional analyses; results led similar conclusions regarding effects dietary intervention. Establishment common terminology breast cancer adju- vant trial endpoints future priority research community. This study several potential limitations. One imbal- ance surgical treatments groups: 5.6% women control group intervention group breast-conserving therapy. As result, 55 women control group surgery risk ipsilateral recurrence. However, considering 1018 control group women breast-conserving surgery, 2.1% experienced ipsilat- eral recurrence. Consequently, one additional in- breast recurrence would anticipated based surgical distribution. Thus, modest imbalance surgical management unlikely explain difference clinical outcome observed. In addition, large National Surgical Adjuvant Breast Bowel Project Cancer randomized trial comparing mastectomy lumpectomy plus radiation, women mas- tectomy similar rate local regional recurrences approximately 5 years follow-up, even ipsilateral breast recurrences included (45 recurrences seen mastectomy group compared 43 lumpectomy plus radiation group) ( 47 ) . Moreover, adjustment surgery type (mastectomy versus lumpectomy) Cox proportional haz- ards models controlled effect differ- ences surgical management. A second limitation study reliance self- report dietary intake validated “ gold standard ” exists assessing dietary fat intake ( 48 ) . However, body weight statistically signiﬁ cantly lower dietary group, providing biologic plausibility dietary change occur women low-fat eating plan. Although dietary intervention focused reducing fat intake, intake nutrients changed, body weight. Thus, possi- ble weight change ( 49 , 50 ) and/or dietary factors fat intake inﬂ uenced breast cancer outcome. Planned future analyses examine time trends associations changes body weight dietary factors breast cancer recurrence. Study strengths include randomized study design, closely comparable anticancer systemic therapies provided women two randomization groups, degree dietary adherence achieved study participants.

Processed (nitrite-preserved red) meat additionally contains high concentrations preformed NOC. In two studies, fresh RM versus vegetarian (VEG) diet (six males six females) nitrite-preserved red meat (PM) versus VEG diet (5 males 11 females), investigated whether processing meat might increase colorectal cancer risk stimulating nitrosation DNA damage. Meat diets contained 420 g (males) 366 g (females) meat/per day. Faecal homogenates day 10 onwards analysed haem NOC asso- ciated supernatants genotoxicity.

Introduction Red processed (nitrite-preserved red) meat (PM) increase risk colorectal cancer PM showing higher risk estimates per gram intake red meat (RM) (1–3). Heterocyclic amines—known carcinogens (4)—are formed cooking meat high temper- atures, speciﬁc red PM (5). RM intake shows dose–response relation endogenous formation nitroso compounds (NOC), whereas relation white meat (6,7). This probably due abundant presence haem RM (8,9), readily become nitrosylated act nitrosating agent (10).

Many NOC known carcinogens alkylation DNA induce G A transitions genes mutated colorectal cancer ras (13). The NOC-speciﬁc DNA adduct O6-carboxymethyl-2#- deoxy-guanosine increases exfoliated colonic cells volunteers fed high RM diet (14).

Minced products hamburgers may may classiﬁed PM. In populations existing epi- demiological ﬁndings based, PM mainly consists processed RMs beef pork (3,15). Supplements nitrate shown increase faecal NOC levels (16), clear whether preservation method would result increased endogenous NOC production, hence explain higher colorectal cancer risk processed compared RM. In two studies, fresh RM (beef pork) versus vegetarian (VEG) diet—referred RM study—and nitrite-preserved red meat (bacon, ham, luncheon meat corned beef) versus VEG diet—referred PM study—we investi- gated whether form processing might increase colorectal cancer risk stimulating nitrosation DNA damage. Methods Subjects Healthy males females Cambridgeshire recruited local advertisements. Participants 20 85 years age, non- smokers, free diabetes bowel disease, taking medication affecting gut least 3 months prior study, pregnant partici- pating another biochemical intervention study time. Prior study, subjects examined medical practitioner. All subjects received verbal written information signed written consent form. The studies approved Cambridge Local Research Ethics Committee. Sixteen volunteers included PM study (5 males 11 females); 12 volunteers participated RM study (six males six females), described previously (14). Study design The studies randomized crossover design high meat versus VEG period: PM versus VEG PM study RM versus VEG RM study. Each dietary period lasted least 14 days. Subjects lived volunteer suite MRC Dunn Human Nutrition Unit, food provided carefully controlled specimens could collected processed immediately. Subjects followed normal routine allowed consume foods drinks prepared diet techni- cians. Body weights monitored ensure constant weight through- out. Faecal samples collected weighed daily radio opaque marker capsules taken throughout check compliance measurement transit time (17). After subjects consumed diet 10 days, stools collected dry ice analysis NOC, haem genotoxicity. Ó The Author 2009. Published Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

The endogenous formation NOC likely begin formation RSNO stomach, acidic conditions facilitate formation compounds (11). These compounds promote formation NOC, particular nitrosyl haem, anaerobic reducing environment gastrointestinal tract. Considering importance NOC production along gastroin- testinal tract, association MTT faecal NOC concen- trations investigated meat diets. The statistically signiﬁcant association MTT faecal NOC concentrations PM diet—in particular FeNO compounds–supports hypothesis compounds formed anaerobic conditions small large intestines. However, lack association following RM diet signiﬁcantly longer transit times suggests threshold effect. The alkaline comet assay detects DNA strand breaks alkali- labile sites, i.e. apurinic apyrimidinic sites baseless sugars. These result variety damage might also represent intermediates repair process. Including DNA glycosylase en- zymes results excision oxidatively damaged nucleobases DNA strand, leaves additional strand breaks (21). Despite different composition faecal NOC PM RM diets, clear effect FW-induced DNA strand breaks, PM resulted signiﬁcantly FW-induced EndoIII-sensitive sites. However, due low concentrations total NOC FW, able analyse NOC composition hence cannot relate NOC composition FW faecal homoge- nates. We currently explanation unexpected higher level DNA strand breaks VEG diets compared high meat diets, intriguing given recent study showing higher colorectal cancer incidence vegetarians meat eaters (25). Nevertheless, studies underway exchanging red PM white meat ﬁsh eliminate possible interfering plant constituents, e.g. polyphenols. Dietary analysis total phe- nols using Folin–Ciolcalteu method showed similar levels phenols meat VEG study diets (data shown), test distinguish different kinds polyphenolic compounds.

Similar previous studies, faecal NOC levels low (3–4 nmol/g) diets containing meat negligible amount haem. On nitrite- preserved (PM) fresh RM diets containing similar amounts haem (86–110 mmol/d), faecal NOC levels increase signiﬁcantly 180 nmol/g. Dietary NOC PM diet (58 mmol/d) order magnitude greater excretion, whereas NOC content RM diet negligible resulted similar levels excretion faeces PM diet (adjusted means PM 28.4 ± 2.6 mmol/d RM 22.0 ± 3.0 mmol/d). However, RM diet, faecal FeNO represent greater proportion total NOC compared PM diet concentrations positively associated haem concentrations. In addition, meat diets, concentrations FeNO signiﬁ- cantly higher RSNO, conﬁrms important contribution haem endogenous NOC production (9). Mirvish et al. (24) studied mice fed hot dogs without NaNO2 concluded faecal NOC excretion represents mainly excretion ingested NOC NOC formed nitrosation precursor NOC nitrite. In contrast, results suggest faecal NOC unlikely simply derived diet mainly formed endogenously. However, preformed NOC present study diets confused precursor NOC analysed A.M.C.P.Joosen et al. 0.1–3.3 mg/d women 0.8–5.4 mg/d men (adjusted energy intake, age, weekday season), would somehow lower nitrite alone calculated (15).

However, many studies measured prebreast cancer dietary pattern shortly following diag- nosis breast cancer. As diets commonly change following diagnosis [22], dietary recalls extended periods include diagnosis additional measure- ment problems excluded review. In 1994, Canadian National Breast Screening Study reported 5-year survival data subsample 678 breast cancer cases completed diet history prior diagnosis [23]. In study, lower saturated fat intake (but intake total fat oleic acid) associated survival, women highest versus lowest quartiles intake b carotene vitamin C food sources appeared protected. The Nurses’ Health Study well-known long-term investigation cohort female registered nurses. Holmes et al. [15] reported subsample (n¼ 1982) diagnosed breast cancer 1976 1990 completed dietary assessment postdiagnosis period followed 1994. Consumption fruit, red meat grain-based products associated either all-cause mortality breast carcinoma death. However, among women metastatic cancer, con- sumption vegetables, carotenoids ﬁber lower mortality rates. Kroenke et al. [17] reported 2619 nurses diagnosed 1982 1998 completed dietary questionnaire least 1 year diagnosis. Over median follow-up 9 years, 9% participants died breast cancer. Using factor analysis, researchers identiﬁed two dietary patterns: one vegetables, fruit, whole grains, low fat dairy, poultry, ﬁsh ﬁber consumption increased across quintiles (prudent dietary pattern), consumption reﬁned grains, red meat, processed meat, high-fat dairy, saturated fat dessert increased across quintiles (western dietary pattern). Neither dietary pattern related breast cancer mortality. However, prudent dietary pattern reduced Western dietary pattern increased deaths causes. Thus, no-association result dietary fat consumption consistent across two overlapping cohorts, conclusions mortality association con- sumption vegetables, fruit ﬁber not.

Two randomized trials reported: WINS focused dietary fat hypothesis, whereas WHEL focused plant-based dietary pattern included reduction dietary fat. WHEL reported comprehensive dietary change effect prognosis, whereas WINS found marginal positive effect changing fat. This review compares postmenopausal participants studies, focusing might explain differ- ent results. Both studies indicate dietary pattern strong ‘across board’ predictor prognosis. Each study suggests dietary pattern may effective within subgroup people. Further investi- gation subgroups required, particularly focused population evidence mechanism dietary patterns may impact prognosis.

Summary The relation cancer metabolic disorders recognized several decades ago, underlying mechanisms involved cancer development progression remain obscure. In last years, many groups studying systemic adipose tissue markers cancer patients. However, con- sistent results obtained. On hand, several studies revealed many aspects adipose tissue physiology obesity. Nowadays, recognized excessive lipid uptake adipocytes leads hypertrophy consequently metabolic dysregulation, hypoxia, impaired adipocytokine expression angiogenesis, insulin resistance macrophage recruitment. In obese patients, tumours commonly colocalize excessive adipose tissue accumulation, features hypertrophic adipose tissue observed cancer patients, namely breast colon. This review aimed summarize pathological adipose tissue alterations may contribute cancer aetiology development.

The prevalence obesity rapidly increasing worldwide; 71% US men 62% US women overweight obese. In Europe, metabolic syndrome affects individuals, 25–31% increase increasing prevalence obesity children young adults [1–4]. Obesity increases risk multiple health conditions, including diabetes, hypertension cancer. However, BMI distinguish adipose tissue tissues, inform fat distribution [1–4]. Epidemiological studies shown high BMI values strongly associated increased incidence several types cancer also premalignant lesions [5,6]. However, colorectal cancer shown strongly associated waist circumference visceral adipose tissue [1,7]. This link stronger men visceral fat. However, considering waist circumference (marker visceral obesity), differences sexes disappear [1,7–11]. Women men waist circumferences >99 101 cm, respectively, 50% higher colon cancer risk [1,7,8,10]. In addition, infantile obesity also demonstrated increase colon cancer risk adult life [9,12]. On hand, gastric bypass surgery shown decrease risk cancer mortality [13]. In postmenopausal women, obesity associated higher incidence breast cancer, reduced likelihood survival increased likelihood recurrence [9]. Adipose tissue obesity cancer Adipose tissue contains several cell types including adipocytes, preadipocytes, ﬁbroblasts, endothelial cells resident macrophages, produce broad range cytokines, adipocytokines growth factors, adiponectin, leptin, resistin, visfatin, VEGF, PAI-1, MCP-1 TNF-a (Figures 1 2) [3,9,11,14,15]. Recent studies correlated pathological alterations adipocyte hypertrophy, rather hyperplasia. During adipocyte hypertrophy, activation NF-kB leads inactivation PPARg insulin receptor. This conduces decreased lipid glucose uptake, adiponectin secretion adipo- genesis. In addition, increased expression inﬂammatory, chemoattractant, growth matrix remodelling factors also observed (Figure 2) [1,9,11,15–17]. Consequently, FFAs accumulate tissues liver muscle, causing hepatic peripheral lipotoxicity insulin resistance [18,19]. During process, adipose tissue localization appears critical. As already discussed, visceral adiposity considered major risk factor metabolic syndrome apparently cancer. It suggested adipose tissue may support tumour cell growth. Adipose tissue-derived factors shown inﬂuence behaviour tumour cells. Mature adipocytes promote proliferation tumour cells tridimensional cultures, adipocyte-conditioned medium also promotes tumour cell invasion prolifera- tion [20]. Further, Carter Church recently demonstrated conditioned medium adipocytes isolated breast adipose tissue increased cell motility normal malignant breast epithelial cells [21]. In mice, simultaneous (but separate) injection tumoral cells adipose tissue results tumour formation metastasis [14]. In addition, Hirose co-workers showed db/db mice, hyperleptinaemia hyperinsulinaemia, increased susceptibility colon premalignant lesions induced azoxymethane [22]. Authors laboratory also showed effects prevented antioxidants [23,24]. Despite fact model used studies hyperleptinaemia, Aparicio colleagues showed leptin may reduce development premalignant lesions colon [25]. Thus, besides increasing tumour progression, obesity diabetes apparently contribute increased formation premalignant lesions, role different players still unknown. The formation hypoxic regions major effect cell metabolism. Thus, expected metabolic intermediates resulting hypertrophy may somehow regulate angiogenesis. In last decades, many studies shown inﬂammation link them. Cells respond metabolic alterations mechanisms involved innate immunity, activating inﬂammatory pathways [18,19]. Besides resulting insulin resistance, also contributes angiogenesis. Inﬂammation angiogenesis share common pathways, cytokines adipocytokines pro-angiogenic effects, contributing tissue irrigation also cancer progression [9,18–20]. Moreover, adipose tissue tumours recruit macrophages, whereas tumour also recruits adipose stroma cells, showing strong relation adipose tissue tumour [8]. The integration mechanisms adipose tissue tumour physiology discussed following sections. Metabolic dysregulation adipose tissue tumour cells Dysregulation lipid metabolism Adipocyte hypertrophy results accumulation secondary metabolites (such long-chain acetyl-CoA diacylglycerol) involved activation several stress inﬂammatory pathways, consequently leading insulin resistance triglyceride hydrolysis (Figure 2) [19,26–28]. Like adipocytes, macrophages ability change Copyright © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Diabetes Metab Res Rev 2013; 29: 285–295. DOI: 10.1002/dmrr Adipose Tissue Dysfunction Cancer 287 Figure 1. Schematic representation adipose tissue localization relation tumours, common breast colon cancer. Adipocyte hypertrophy correlates increased expression inﬂammatory mediators macrophage inﬁltration, common features obesity- related cancer. Furthermore, macrophage inﬁltration contributes collagen deposition tumour cell migration blood Figure 2. Metabolic, endocrine inﬂammatory alterations hypertrophic adipocytes. Hypertrophy characterized excessive cytoplasmatic accumulation FFAs hypoxia, leading activation inﬂammatory stress pathways inactivation insulin signalling. These mechanisms involve increased TNF-a, MCP-1, VEGF, resistin leptin decreased adiponectin expression, contributing increased macrophage inﬁltration. Tissue macrophages regulate matrix degradation collagen deposition. These mechanisms constitute hypoxia feedback mechanism increase angiogenesis inhibit continuous adipocyte growth, decreasing hypoxia. However, angiogenic chemoattractant mediators macrophages also regulate tumour growth Copyright © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Diabetes Metab Res Rev 2013; 29: 285–295. DOI: 10.1002/dmrr 288 P. Matafome et al. lipids, phenotype store large amounts leading foam cell formation, common hypertrophic adipose tissue. These macrophages increased inﬂammatory potential, creating positive inﬂammatory loop adipose tissue [9]. Importantly, PPARg controls lipid storage adipocytes macrophages inactivated inﬂammatory pathways (Figure 2). On hand, amount lipids adipocyte process store depends ability peripheral organs oxidize fatty acids, mainly controlled AMPK [1,9,11,29,30]. PPARg diet regulation. PPARg nuclear receptor transcription factor activated mostly lipids, increasing expression several proteins involved fatty acid uptake storage [11,15,30] (Figure 2). Furthermore, PPARg directly inhibits nuclear translocation NF-k B, thereby inhibiting expression cytokines inﬂammatory mediators [11,15,30,31]. Although tu- mour cells express PPARg, yet established whether expression related tumour differentiation metastasis [1]. PPARg ligands, including TZDs, known inhibit proliferation cancer cells, increasing nu- clear levels tumour suppressor BRCA1 [1,14]. Positive effects PPARg activators cancer progression may also due decreased ectopic accumulation substrates cy- toplasm, namely glucose lipids, decreased in- ﬂammation insulin resistance. As PPARg diet-regulated transcription factor, involvement dietary lipids adipocyte homeostasis appears obvious. In fact, saturated FFAs activate NF-kB TLR4 signalling, whereas PUFAs bind activate PPARg [30,31]. Despite PUFAs o-3 o-6 activating PPARg, described distinct effects cancer development growth. o-3 PUFAs inhibit cancer growth cell motility, increasing PPARg activation cell lines enhancing cancer cell apoptosis mice [11]. On hand, o-6 PUFAs positively correlated tumour development breast shown promote tumour cell motility [11]. Thus, diet regulation PPARg important tumour development, underlying mechanisms remain unknown. AMP-activated kinase. AMPK, major energy regulator activated adiponectin, increases glycolysis fatty acid oxidation inhibits gluconeogenesis fatty acid cholesterol synthesis [29,32]. However, obese type 2 diabetic individuals usually decreased adiponectin levels, AMPK activity fatty acid oxidation. AMPK inhibits SREBP1c activates PPARa. This results increased expression several enzymes involved fatty acid oxidation decreased expression ACC FAS, key enzymes fatty acid synthesis [33]. Furthermore, AMPK directly inactivates ACC, thereby decreasing malonyl-CoA formation (inhibitor CPT- 1-mediated mitochondrial acetyl-CoA, resulting higher rates mitochondrial acid uptake) fatty fatty acid uptake oxidation [9,29,32,34]. AMPK activates PI3K Akt induces GLUT-4 transloca- tion cell membrane, thereby increasing glucose uptake [29,32,35]. Moreover, Abbot colleagues recently showed AMPK necessary Akt-mediated fatty acid uptake muscle [35]. Several authors suggested AMPK-induced inhibition lipid synthesis good strategy decrease lipid availability cell membranes tumour growth [34]. AMPK also activates p53, inhibiting cell cycle [34]. Furthermore, AMPK inhibits aromatase expression adipose tissue, contributing decreased oestrogen levels preventing development oestrogen- dependent tumours [34]. Thus, AMPK activation proposed effective strategy cancer therapy, positive results observed metformin treatment, known activator AMPK [34]. Hypoxia A reliable feature hypertrophic adipose tissue hypoxia (resulting decreased blood supply), also conducive activation inﬂammatory pathways, macrophage recruitment dysregulation adipocyto- kine secretion [9,36,37]. However, hypoxia also common tumours. HIF-1 key factor cell response hypoxia, stimulating inﬂammation angiogenesis (discussed following sections) [38,39]. These mechanisms likely support tumour growth [9]. Furthermore, HIF-1 exerts signiﬁcant effects cellular metabolism. Cancer cells signiﬁcant shift away oxidative phosphorylation mitochon- dria towards glycolysis, state involved ‘Warburg effect’ [40–42]. Warburg ﬁrstly described cancer cells increased glucose uptake ATP formation (see comprehensive revisions issue [92–94]). As tumour mostly hypoxic, HIF-1 increases transcrip- tion cell-surface glucose transporter GLUT-1 contributes expression several glycolytic enzymes, including lactate dehydrogenase, inhibits acetyl-CoA formation, would used oxidative phosphor- ylation [40,42]. In addition, high rate glucose consumption, malignant cells accumulate high amounts pyruvate, used fuel tricarboxylic acid cycle biosynthetic processes, even earlier by-products glycolysis enter pentose phosphate pathway maintenance DNA, RNA fatty acids. Recently, colleagues showed methylglyoxal, metabolite glycolysis, increases HIF-1 degradation hypoxic conditions [43]. However, cancer cells develop resistance mechanisms elevated expression glyoxalases, degrade methylglyoxal [44]. Glyoxalase expression inhibited cells hyperglycaemic conditions, possibly accounting different ability normal tumoral cells adapt hypoxic conditions [44,45]. The contribution adipose tissue hypoxia tumour development unknown, tumours usually surrounded adipose tissue; thus, likely environment may contribute better tumour adaptation [46].

DOI: 10.1002/dmrr Adipose Tissue Dysfunction Cancer Cytokines adipocytokines – metabolism, inﬂammation angiogenesis Activation inﬂammatory pathways consequence accumulation intracellular metabolites formation hypoxic regions leads altered cytokine adipocy- tokine secretion. This conduces inhibition continued lipids glucose uptake stimulates angiogenesis. However, products released adipose tissue conditions may also affect tumour physiology [30,47–49]. In section, review alterations factors result adipose tissue dysfunction inﬂuence tumour formation development. Adiponectin Adiponectin circulates three distinct molecular forms, trimeric, hexameric high-molecular-weight forms (several hexameric forms), mainly produced adipose tissue [50–52]. Adiponectin levels, especially high-molecular-weight forms, found lower obesity, insulin resistance type 2 diabetes inversely correlated abdominal perimeter fat mass, BMI [1,14,15,53]. Adiponectin expression decreased TNF-a IL-6 (NF-kB activators) increased PPARg (Figure 2). However, adiponectin also inhibits TNF-a IL-6 expression macro- phages, inactivating inﬂammatory cascade [14,20]. Adiponectin increases fatty acid oxidation insulin sensitivity activates AMPK PPARa [1,20]. gluconeogenesis, decreases agonists Adiponectin decreases proliferation several cell types including adipocytes, endothelial cells cancer cells [20]. Beyond inhibition tumour cell growth survival, adiponectin inhibits angiogenesis decreased VEGF Bcl-2 expression (anti-apoptotic) increased p53, Bax caspase activation (pro-apoptotic), leading endothelial cell apoptosis [1,20]. Likewise, adiponectin shown reduce TNF-a-induced effects cell proliferation migration [53]. In fact, several studies showed hypoadiponectinaemia determinant larger tumours increased angiogenesis [1,14,20]. Thus, adiponectin may inﬂammation also angiogenesis, effects may crucial regulation neovascularization pathological conditions obesity, type 2 diabetes also cancer. However, known yet whether hypoadiponectinaemia risk factor cancer hypoadiponectinemia cancer development parallel events metabolic dysregulation. decreasing act Leptin Leptin currently centre obesity–cancer link, produced proportion fat mass (almost exclusively adipocytes) potently induces cell (normal motility [14,20,48,54–57]. Leptin activates JAK/STAT MAPK pathways also SOCS-1 SOCS-3, tumoral) mitogenesis, growth 289 inhibiting insulin signalling cascade [1,15,56,57]. This mechanism chronically activated obesity one major causes leptin insulin resistance [1,14,58]. independently BMI Clinical studies Norwegian Japanese populations showed leptin correlation increased risk breast colon cancers, [45,59]. Furthermore, leptin also positively correlated increased metastization [1,20,51,60]. In patients, tumour cells express Ob-Rb. Insulin, IGF-1 oestradiol observed activate expression [61]. In addition, leptin also promotes aromatase expression adipose tissue ER tumour cells [14,62]. However, leptin mitogenic ER-positive ER-negative tumour cell lines, inhibiting apoptosis increasing cell proliferation [14,20,48,53,62]. From this, may conclude leptin promotes tumour cell proliferation directly indirectly (through increase oestrogen levels insulin resistance). However, leptin effects cancer development still controversial. Several studies reported elevated leptin levels cancer patients, studies compared cancer patients healthy controls without separation obesity component experimental design. Furthermore, existing studies reveal pattern leptin variation premenopause postmeno- pause. Zucker rats, mutation Ob-Rb exhibit hyperleptinaemia, increased formation benign neoplasies minimal formation malign tumours [53]. In fact, possible leptin act tumour inducer supporter already formed tumours. Resistin Resistin pointed major link innate immunity glucose metabolism shown inhibit hepatic, muscle adipose insulin signalling, consequently leading inﬂammation insulin resistance. Its circulating levels usually increased models obesity. Antibody neutralization, overexpres- sion nonfunctional resistin gene knockout mice results improved glucose metabolism insulin sensitivity [15,18,63–65]. However, extrapolating possible effects human resistin murine experiments several caveats. Murine resistin produced adipocytes, whereas human resistin mainly produced macrophages (Figure 2) [15,18,65]. Furthermore, human murine resistin genes located different chromosomes, studies searching human gene similar murine resistin unsuccessful [15]. Recently, Qatanani colleagues developed mice suppressed expression endogenous resistin transgenic expression human resistin macrophages [18]. After consuming high-calorie diet, rats increased lipolysis adipose tissue. They also developed increased triglyceride diacylglycerol levels insulin resistance muscle, due PKC-induced serine phosphor- ylation insulin receptor IRS-1 (Figure 2) [18]. Resistin promotes foam cell formation macrophages Copyright © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Diabetes Metab Res Rev 2013; 29: 285–295. DOI: 10.1002/dmrr 290 P. Matafome et al. increased lipid uptake, resulting activation scavenger receptors (SR-1 CD36) involved recruiting lipoproteins FATP. Conversely, resistin increases proteasomal degradation ABCA1 involved cholesterol efﬂux [15,66]. Human resistin stimulates proliferation vessel muscle cells VECs [15,65,67]. In endothelial choriocarci- noma cells, resistin also increases expression VEGF receptors also elevating MMP, possibly NF-kB activation [65,68]. Thus, resistin overexpression physiological response adipose tissue hypertrophy hypoxia, may also contribute tumour angiogenesis. Despite data issue still scarce, several studies implicated resistin aetiology obesity-related cancers, namely breast colon [50,51,64,69–72]. Resistin may provide unique insights link obesity, inﬂammation, insulin resistance cancer risk humans. Visfatin Visfatin highly expressed visceral fat rodents humans, whose plasma circulating levels positively correlated size visceral fat deposits [73]. Several studies reported increased visfatin levels various pathological conditions, obesity, inﬂamma- tion, diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome cardiovas- cular diseases [74–78]. phosphoribosyltransferase, Visfatin originally isolated lymphocytes enzyme nicotinamide synthesizes nicotinamide mononucleotide nicotinamide [79]. The following studies reported insulin-mimetic effect binding different region insulin receptor, activating IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation [73,80–86]. However, original study reporting effects later retracted [73], mechanisms visfatin action, beyond NAD+ synthesis, remain obscure. Nevertheless, visfatin expression found stimulated HIF-1 JNK/NF-kB pathway, promoting angiogenesis MMP expression endothelial cells VEGF expression tumour cells [79,87–89]. Visfatin also expressed tumoral cells, circulating levels found increased breast colon cancer patients [82,87]. Furthermore, visfatin observed increase cell proliferation invasion breast cancer progression [87]. Visfatin inhibitors clinically evaluated anticancer agents, new epidemiological cellular studies needed understand mechanisms visfatin action cancer [90]. Tumour necrosis factor alpha TNF-a ﬁrst recognized adipose-derived cytokine involved metabolism regulation. In ﬁeld, Hotamisligil’s laboratory particularly active, producing data reviews TNF-a’s role adipocyte metabolism (see reviews [31,47]). TNF-a produced mainly macrophages, also adipocytes preadipocytes, excessive lipid accumulation, activating several serine kinases (JNK IKK). This results NF-kB activation inhibition insulin signalling (Figure 2) [1,14,15,20]. NF-kB stimulates production cytokines inhibits PPARg activity subsequent expression adiponectin, CD36 LPL. Thus, TNF-a inhibits preadipocyte differentiation, lipid glucose uptake fatty acid esteriﬁcation increases lipolysis [1,53]. These mechanisms aim inhibit continued adipocyte growth may also important cancer progression lead metabolism dysregulation (as focused Section 2.1) hyperinsulinaemia, chronically active. In fact, link TNF-a levels breast colon cancer suggested [14]. Beyond metabolic effects, TNF-a seems contribute tissue alterations necessary tumour growth metastasis, namely cell proliferation. TNF-a stimulates aromatase expression adipose tissue, increasing oestrogen-mediated tumour cell proliferation [20,91–93]. Furthermore, TNF-a stimulates VEC prolifera- tion migration rat cornea [53]. Clinical trials several TNF-a antagonists antibodies shown promising effects reducing tumour development metastasis [94]. Monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 MCP-1 protein recruits activates circulating monocytes adipose tissue [95–98]. Initially, MCP-1 considered activator antitumour cytotoxic functions macrophages. However, identiﬁcation two types TAMs revelation MCP-1 angiogenic potential altered perspective MCP-1 physiology cancer (Figure 2) [95,99,100]. In last years, several studies found elevated MCP-1 levels, especially advanced stages [96,99]. However, established whether MCP-1 circulating levels systemic marker poor prognosis not. Some discrepancies may caused different studied populations, experimental designs, degree metastasis, tumour phase time sample collection [99]. In adipose tissue, MCP-1 expression correlates increased macrophage inﬁltration angiogenesis [19,28,36]. In epithelial cells, MCP-1 expression low, acquired along transformation [98,99]. MCP-1 also secreted tumour stroma cells, macrophages ﬁbroblasts, acting paracrine autocrine pathways [95,99]. Recently, Niu colleagues showed MCP-1 promoted vitro tube formation HUVEC. In addition, Hong colleagues showed effects dependent VEGF activation [101,102]. Furthermore, MCP-1 observed increase angiopoietin (Ang)-2 levels MMP expression monocytes, T cells tumour cells, also contributes angiogenesis [96,99,103]. On tumour cells, MCP-1 induce proliferation increases migration ability. MCP-1 also suggested involved epithelial-to-mesenchymal transformation, event essential cell transformation [99]. Higher levels MCP-1 correlated increased macrophage inﬁltration, MSC migration, vascularization, tumour progression lymphatic invasion [95,96,99,104]. An anti-MCP-1 antibody decreased MSC migration tumour, Copyright © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Diabetes Metab Res Rev 2013; 29: 285–295. DOI: 10.1002/dmrr Adipose Tissue Dysfunction Cancer 291 angiogenesis lung metastasis, increasing survival ratio [99,104]. Thus, adipose tissue, MCP-1 recruited macrophages change tumour microenvi- ronment support cell proliferation migration angiogenesis. Angiogenic mechanisms – growth factors matrix remodelling Adipose tissue profoundly depends angiogenesis subjected constant expansion/regression. Capillary growth complex process involving matrix degradation, endothelial cell migration tube formation depends anastomosis two growing tubes. This process regulated several factors, namely ﬁbroblast growth factors, hepatic growth factor (HGF), VEGF, Angs (Ang-1 Ang-2), epithelial growth factors, adipocytokines, insulin/IGF-1, oestrogens MMP, already discussed review [53]. Several adipose-derived factors paracrine effects, acting directly neighbouring endothelial cells promote angiogenesis. Most factors produced response adipocyte hypertrophy consequent metabolic dysregulation regional hypoxia. As already discussed, unifying point inﬂammation, results conditions. Inﬂammatory mediators directly induce angiogenesis increase expression several angiogenic factors. Furthermore, factors also recruit macrophages, also produce set angiogenic factors (VEGF, TNF-a, ﬁbroblast growth factors, MMPS resistin), contributing angiogenesis (Figure 2) [53,105,106]. Tumour angiogenesis important growth, vessels usually dysfunctional abnormal ramiﬁca- tions, probably due imbalanced expression growth factors hypertrophic adipose tissue tumour. Furthermore, vessels usually permeable allow passage ﬂuids, proteins tumour cells, favouring metastization. Growth factors VEGF angiogenic factor speciﬁc VECs. Obese individuals commonly increased VEGF levels [see review 53]. VEGF produced adipose tissue cells, namely adipocytes, preadipocytes macro- phages, stimulating VEC proliferation migration, ex- pression proteolytic enzymes tube formation inhibiting apoptosis (Figure 2) [53]. VEGF expression stimulated regional hypoxia (through HIF-1 stabiliza- tion), factors EGF family insulin (via PI3K Akt), compensate insulin-induced nutrient deposition tissue expansion [53,107,108]. Recently, group described VEGF/Ang-2 ratio determine vascular integrity. The imbalance ratio caused endothelial cell apoptosis loss vessel integrity [109]. However, increased tumour VEGF levels also associated poor prognosis [53]. Consequently, several antitumour drugs based neutralization developed. Antibody neutralization VEGF recep- tor 2 also decreased angiogenesis preadipocyte differentiation [53]. Other growth factors bFGF HGF also studied possible players tumour growth. bFGF HGF produced adipocytes stimulate VEC proliferation MMP expression [20,53,110]. For bFGF, correlations BMI found previous studies, probably acts mainly paracrine mechanisms [53]. HGF known act receptor Met (product c-met gene) promote proliferation, motility invasion hepatic tumour parenchymal cells [53,110,111]. However, HFG produced proportionally BMI correlates bigger tumours increased lymphatic invasion [20,53]. Furthermore, HGF promotes cell invasion independently VEGF also increases expression [20,53,110,111]. HGF highly produced tumour peritumoral adipose tissue, decreasing tumour excision [20]. Proteolytic matrix degradation – plasminogen system Besides MMPs, plasminogen system also regulates extracellular matrix degradation, allow vessel growth. This system formed plasminogen, cleavage enzymes (tissue plasminogen activator uPA serine proteases), PAI-1 membrane uPA receptor (uPAR), regulating ﬁbrinolysis matrix proteolysis [see review 11]. Plasminogen cleaved plasmin tissue plasminogen activator arterial walls uPA extracellular matrix, increasing matrix degradation [11]. Furthermore, uPA binding uPAR leads integrin binding cytoskeleton arrangement favouring cell migration [11]. Thus, uPA uPAR markers invasiveness poor prognosis. uPA inhibition results decreased tumour invasiveness. On hand, PAI-1 binds inhibits uPA. This complex binds uPAR internalized [11]. Despite uPA inhibition effects, circu- lating PAI-1 levels marker poor prognosis breast cancer, suggested potential target cancer therapy [11]. Although reasons elevated PAI-1 levels known, known highly produced dysfunc- tional adipose tissue, suggested promote cell growth migration, angiogenesis migration smooth muscle cells [11,112]. Insulin – mitogenesis IGF-1 regulation Insulin resistance common patients elevated BMI hallmark type 2 diabetes, usually associated visceral obesity inﬂammation adipose tissue [7,14,15]. Also, effects insulin analogues type 1 diabetic patients discussed last years. Long-action insulin analogues, glargine, widely used cause hypoglycaemia. However, attempting efﬁciently control postprandial glycaemia medications, authors found Copyright © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Diabetes Metab Res Rev 2013; 29: 285–295. DOI: 10.1002/dmrr 292 P. Matafome et al. patients episodically hyperinsulinaemic [113]. Hyperin- sulinaemia pointed major risk factor breast, colon prostate cancer [7,14,15,114–116]. Also, elevated C-peptide levels found associated threefold increase colon cancer risk [1,12]. Insulin shown increase cell survival growth (through IRS-1–PI3K–Akt pathway), supporting [113]. Furthermore, Chen tumour development colleagues recently reported insulin-mediated activation pathway causes chemotherapy resistance, originating new questions role insulin cancer [117,118]. However, impact insulin mitogenic effects obesity-related cancer pathway controversial, IRS-1 partially inhibited insulin resistance. Thus, discovery noncanonical pathway insulin-stimulated mitogenesis major hallmark metabolism-related cancer. Most growth factors activate canonical Ras–Raf–MAPK pathway. Besides increasing IGF-1 VEGF circulating levels aromatase expression adipose tissue, insulin also observed increase isoprenylated (active) Ras levels cell membrane, thereby increasing cell response growth factors (see review [113]). The IGF family components include IGF-1 2, membrane receptors (IGFR1 2), IGFBPs (IGFBP1 IGFBP6) IGFBP proteases [14]. Like insulin, IGF-1 regulates cell survival, growth differentiation inhibits apoptosis [9]. On hand, IGFBPs decrease IGF bioavailability, inhibiting effects promoting apoptosis [14]. However, IGFBP1 IGFBP2 expressions downregulated insulin, increasing free/active IGF-1 levels [3,8]. Insulin-resistant individuals commonly higher IGF-1 circulating levels [3,8,9]. On epithelial cells, IGF-1–IGFR binding leads receptor dimerization PI3K Ras–Raf–MAPK activation [14]. Furthermore, oestrogens increase IGF-1 IGFR1 expressions, acting synergistically favour tumour growth [14]. As insulin, IGF-1 also activates VEGF expres- sion thus indirectly acts endothelial cells [1]. Elevated IGF-1 decreased IGFBP-1 levels previously correlated increased cancer risk, tumour invasion poor prognosis [1,14]. Also, breast tumours elevated IGFR-1 levels, premenopause postmenopause, usually invasive [14]. In mice, IGF-1 overexpression resulted increased tumour growth, whereas disruption IGFR1 prevented [8,9,14]. The role macrophages tissue remodelling – implications adipose tissue tumour In obese individuals, adipose tissue commonly extensive macrophage inﬁltration, recruited TNF-a particularly MCP-1 (Figure 2). On hand, macrophage-secreted products TNF-a resistin induce insulin resistance promote angiogenesis (Figure 2). Macrophage coculture results impaired adipocytokine expression increased production pro-inﬂammatory cytokines adipocytes [8]. Tumour environment formed several cell types, namely ﬁbroblasts, cells hematopoietic lineage, endothelial cells adipocytes. These cells strongly interact, creating microenvironment conducive tumour growth [119,120]. Adipose-related tumours large amounts macrophages (up 50% tumour cells) [100,105,119,120]. More 80% cancers elevated macrophage inﬁltration, correlating increased vessel density, tumour progression poor prognosis [53,99,100,104,105,119]. Genetic macrophage elimination reduces tumour progression metastasis mice [8]. A tumour commonly two distinct populations macrophages: M1 macrophages pro-inﬂammatory secrete antitumour cytokines M2 macrophages immunosuppressive produce broad range angiogenic growth factors, including MCP-1, MMPs, TGF-b, VEGF PDGF, promoting proliferation migration tumour cells VEC, matrix degradation ultimately angiogenesis [8,49,104–106,119–121]. The reason macrophage population acquires behaviour still unknown. However, also observed macrophages recruited hypertrophic adipose tissue, involved tissue remodelling angiogenesis [36]. Macrophages intensely populate ﬁbrotic ring surrounding tumour regions basal membrane rupture. They seem regulate collagen synthesis ﬁbroblasts also support blood vessel formation close collagen ﬁbres [119]. This leads increased collagen deposition, anchored blood vessels, allowing faster tumour cell migration circulation (Figure 1) [100,119]. These features found macrophage- deﬁcient mice [8,119]. Importantly, adipose tissue obese animal models recently described develop extensive ﬁbrotic regions, may support growth adipose-associated tumours tumour periphery also high aromatase expression, increased macrophage-released cytokines TNF-a [14,20]. [121]. Fibroblasts The close relation tumour cells macrophages invasive front involves CSF-1 EGF signalling [100,120]. Tumour cells express CSF-1 increase macrophage activity, macrophages express EGF stimulate migration tumour cells. Accordingly, macro- phages express CSF-1R whereas tumour cells express EGFR1 [119]. Mice CSF-1 depletion decreased VEGF MMP expression metastization benign phenotypes. CSF-1 expression restores phenotype, CSF-1 overexpression normal mice leads TAM increased tumour growth metastization [100,119]. Moreover, macrophage depletion results 40% decreased angiogenesis even advanced tumours, suggesting macrophages involved formation new blood vessels remodelling already existing, observed adipose tissue expansion [36,100,119]. Macrophage-derived VEGF, beyond VEC Copyright © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Diabetes Metab Res Rev 2013; 29: 285–295. DOI: 10.1002/dmrr Adipose Tissue Dysfunction Cancer 293 stimulation, also recruits macrophages support tumour growth [100,119]. Present data show TAM adipose tissue macrophages share important similari- ties, promoting tissue remodelling angiogenesis. In addition, adipose tissue macrophages may possibly support tumour development. Conclusions adipose hypertrophy. Hypertrophic Adipose tissue dysfunction obesity occurs result tissue tissue commonly presents dysregulated lipid metabolism formation hypoxic regions. These two events lead activation inﬂammatory pathways and, consequently, increased pro- impaired adipocytokine expression, inﬂammatory cytokine expression, angiogenesis, insulin resistance recruitment. All features also observed tumours, usually close dysfunctional adipose tissue, namely breast colon cancers. Despite mechanisms discussed shown tumour supportive, macrophage trigger tumour development still unknown matter interest future studies.

AMPK activation stimulates fatty acid oxidation, enhances insulin sensitivity, alleviates hyperglycemia hyperlipidemia, inhibits proinflammatory changes. Thus, AMPK well- received therapeutic target metabolic syndrome Type 2 diabetes. Recent studies indicate AMPK plays role linking metabolic syndrome cancer. AMPK essential mediator tumor suppressor LKB1 could suppressed cancer cells containing loss-of-function mutations LKB1 containing active mutations B-Raf, cancers associated metabolic syndrome. The activation AMPK reprograms cellular metabolism enforces metabolic checkpoints acting mTORC1, p53, fatty acid synthase molecules regulating cell growth metabolism. In keeping in  vitro studies, recent epidemiological studies indicate incidence cancer reduced Type 2 diabetes treated metformin, AMPK activator. Thus, AMPK emerging interesting metabolic tumor suppressor promising target cancer prevention therapy. AMP-activated protein kinase acts fuel gauge activated stresses hypoxia, ischemia, glucose deprivation exercise [1]. Activation AMPK stimulates fatty acid oxidation generate ATP cope acute energy demand inhibits anabolic processes consume ATP [1]. As result, energy preserved acute cellular pro- grams. In addition, AMPK activation enhances insulin sensitivity, inhibits hepatic glucose pro- duction, stimulates glucose uptake muscle, inhibits fatty acid synthesis esterification, diminishes proinflammatory changes [2]. Thus, AMPK well-accepted target treatment metabolic syndrome Type 2 diabetes (for extensive reviews, refer [1–3]). During last 5 years, since first review [3], great attention drawn link AMPK cancer, substantial progress made. AMPK, regulating variety down- stream targets, mTORC1, p53 fatty acid synthase (FASN), associated metabolic processes, controls intra cellular energy levels order maintain cell growth rate appropriate level. Likewise, AMPK activation metabolic stress pharmacologi- cal activators regulate various processes, including cell cycle checkpoint, cell polarity, senescence, autophagy apoptosis [4–7]. In article, aim summarize recent evi- dence support notion AMPK serves metabolic tumor suppressor discuss implications AMPK cancer prevention treatment. Activation AMPK AMP-activated protein kinase belongs family serine/threonine protein kinases highly conserved yeast human. It consists three subunits: catalytic subunit (a) two regulatory subunits (b g) [8,9]. In mam- mals, subunit AMPK contains two three isoforms (a1, a2; b1, b2; g1, g2 g3). When cells confront metabolic stress, intra- cellular AMP level ratio AMP ATP increased. AMP binds g-subunit, yielding two outcomes; first, serves allo- steric activator second, protects AMPK phosphatases dephosphorylate threo- nine 172 activation loop catalytic a-subunit [9–11]. Another critical step AMPK activation phosphorylation threonine 172. Previous studies suggest AMP binding enables phosphorylation threonine 172 upstream kinase [12,13]. However, notion challenged recent in vitro studies showing phosphorylation AMPK purified LKB1 complex independent AMP [11,14].

Interestingly, leptin could exert opposite effects AMPK depending cell types. While inhibits enzyme arcuate paraventricular regions hypothalamus fasted mice, leptin activates a2 isotype AMPK skeletal muscle [16,17]. In addition, AMPK acti- vated variety pharmacological agents. The prototypical activator 5-aminoimidazole- 4-carboxamide 1-d-ribonucleoside (AICAR), cell permeable agent phosphorylated converted ZMP, AMP analog, entering cell. Importantly, two clinically used antidiabetic drugs, metformin thia- zolidinediones (TZDs), known activate AMPK [15]. Upon activation, AMPK phosphorylates plethora substrates regulates functions (Figure 1), far beyond canonical ones known promote fatty acid oxidation simultaneously inhibit lipid synthesis [8,9]. Thus far, several kinases identi- fied phosphorylate threonine 172 catalytic a-subunit AMPK leading activation. The first kinase LKB1, originally found liver also known serine/threonine kinase 11 (STK11) [13,18,19]. LKB1 ubiquitously expressed responsible AMPK activation scenarios. The second kinase calmodulin-dependent protein kinase-b (CaMKK-b), phosphorylates AMPK response increases intracellular Ca2+ levels instead AMP [20,21]. Other kinases include TGF-b-activating kinase 1 (TAK1) ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) [22–24]. Whether kinases bona fide kinases AMPK remains determined genetic approach.

This genetic syndrome characterized multiple hamartomatous polyps (benign overgrowth differentiated tissues) gastrointestinal tract mark- edly increased risk gastrointestinal adeno- carcinomas [26]. In addition, somatic mutations LKB1 gene found several cancers, example, approximately 34% lung adenocarcinomas, 19% squamous cell carcinomas 20% cervical carcinomas cancers [27–30]. Although complete ablation LKB1 causes embryonic lethality mouse models, hetero- zygous deletion increases incidence tumor intestine stomach [26] predis- poses animals carcinogenesis induced 7,12 dimethylbenz(a)anthracene, thereby develop- ing squamous cell carcinoma skin lung [31]. In addition, tissue-specific deletion LKB1 endometrial epithelium female mice prostate epithelium male mice causes endometrial adenocarcinomas pros- tate neoplasia, respectively [32,33]. AMPK plays important role mediating tumorigenic effects LKB1. Thus, hypomorphic mutation decreases LKB1 markedly accelerates tumor development PTEN+/- mice, whereas pharma- cological AMPK activators significantly delay tumor onset [34]. In LKB1-deficient lung cancer cells, AMPK activity suppressed refrac- tory pharmacological activators, leading increased mTORC1 signaling, whereas abil- ity AMPK inhibit cell growth restored wild-type LKB1 expressed [35,36].

AMPK: journey metabolic syndrome cancer Metabolic syndrome combination metabolic disorders insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia proinflammatory procoagulant changes increase risk cardiovascular disease diabetes. Studies human rodents shown metabolic disorders, insulin resis- tance, obesity Type 2 diabetes, accom- panied decreases AMPK activity, activation AMPK ACIAR, TZDs, metformin, polyphenols exercise cor- rect prevent disorders [2,65–68]. Of note, AMPK activation stimulates fatty acid oxida- tion, sounds paradoxical use treatment diabetes metabolic syndrome, increased fatty acid oxidation may lead ketosis. It pointed ketosis severe Type 2 diabetes Type 1 diabetes. In Type 1 diabetes, peripheral tissues burn fat alternative fuel source compensate shortage glucose absence insulin, results intoler- able increases ketone bodies. By contrast, Type 2 diabetes metabolic syndrome, major problems insulin resistance liver, muscle adipose tissue (e.g., increased hepatic glucose production decreased glu- cose uptake skeletal muscle), increased proinflammatory response cardio vascular system [2]. AMPK activation shown mitigate abnormalities. In fact, severe ketosis found side effect metformin TZDs treatment Type 2 diabetes. In recent years, metabolic syndrome found associated cancer, new evi- dence suggests AMPK could play bridging role, illustrated Figure 3. AMPK: key regulator link metabolic syndrome & cancer A large body epidemiological studies indi- cated metabolic syndrome risk factor many types cancer associated increased mortality poor prog nosis [69–72]. Likewise, association metabolic syndrome tumorigenesis also dem- onstrated experimental studies [73–75]. Using tumor xenograft mouse model obesity insulin resistance induced high-fat diet, Yakar et al. shown tumor growth significantly increased obese mice [73]. A second line evidence came study fatless mouse model, expression transgene A-ZIP/F-1, encoding domi- nant negative protein prevents DNA- binding B-ZIP transcription factors C/EBP Jun families, control adipose-specific aP2 enhancer/promoter [74].

When MKR+/+ mice crossed mice expressing Polyoma Virus middle T oncongene mammary gland orthotopically inoculated mouse tumor cells, tumor growth markedly enhanced. Intriguingly, treatment animals CL-316243, potent insulin sensitizing drug specifically activates b3-adrenergic receptor, significantly reduced elevated insu- lin levels MKR+/+ mice concomitantly attenuated mammary tumor progression [75]. Thus far, animal epidemiological studies support contention metabolic syndrome increases risk cancer correction metabolic disorders could beneficial cancer prevention treatment. AMPK likely benevolent candidate fulfill latter mission. Indeed, idea supported recent studies. First, retrospective investiga- tions reported patients Type 2 diabetes taking metformin display reduced risk cancer compared normal popula- tion patients never taken metformin [77,78], reduced trend mortal- ity compared patients take sulfonyl- ureas insulin [79]. In addition, reduced levels adiponectin found plasma patients cancers (e.g., breast prostate cancers), treatment cancer cells adipo nectin attenuated growth, event blocked dominant negative mutant AMPK [80–83]. Finally, large num- ber studies shown maneuvers activate AMPK, treatment pharma- cological agents (e.g., AICAR, metformin TZDs), exercise dietary restriction, attenuate cancer cell growth in vitro inhibit tumor development in vivo [34,36,84–87]. Dysregulation AMPK cancer In addition loss-of-function mutations LKB1 Peutz–Jeghers syndrome can- cers, AMPK could suppressed oncogenic mutations (Figure 2). Previous studies shown AMPK phosphorylated inhibited insulin-activated Akt [88]. However, reported cancer cells containing consti- tutively activated Akt. Additionally, mRNA levels AMPKa2 inversely correlate clini- cal prognosis breast ovarian tumors, diminished cancer cells activated PI3K pathways [89]. Since Akt activated many cancer cells PTEN inactivated PI3K constitutively activated, interesting expand study examining human tumor specimens. In fact, recent investigations, despite limited number, shed light direction [90,91]. One report showed AMPK activation reduced lung cancer specimens 462 Future Oncol.

A second study examined acti- vation status AMPK breast cancer speci- mens showed phospho-AMPK phospho-ACC signals reduced, inversely correlates histological grade axilliary node metastasis [90]. It investigated reduction AMPK activ- ity correlates metabolic status breast cancer patients. Recently, two independent studies indi- cated LKB1 inhibited active mutant B-Raf, event mediated ERK1/2 [92,93]. Intriguingly, opposite changes phos- phorylation ERK AMPK observed melanoma specimens [92]. This finding may important clinical implication, inas- much activating mutation B-Raf accounts approximately 6% human cancer, highest incidence malignant melanoma (50–70%) [94]. Furthermore, ERK1/2 con- stitutively activated cancer cells containing Ras mutations, found 20–30% human cancers [95]. A complex inter-relationship mitogenic metabolic pathways highlighted recent discovery interaction kinase suppressor ras 2 (KSR2) AMPK [96]. KSR1 KSR2 best known scaffold function Raf/MEK/ERK signaling cascade, facilitating activation Raf MEK [97,98]. Costanzo- Garvey et al. found AMPK associates KSR1 KSR2 preference toward latter [96]. Knockout mouse KSR2 gene causes obesity insulin resistance. More interestingly, AMPK activation AICAR diminished MEF cells isolated KSR2 knockout mouse. KSR2 binds AMPK Raf/MEK different domains: AMPK binds domain near super- imposed membrane targeting domain, binding sites Raf MEK located carboxy terminal region KSR2 [96,99]. Hence, tempting speculate KSR2 functions switching point cell fate mitogenesis metabolic checkpoint proteins coexist complex. In prolif- erating cells, KSR2 brings active MEK/ERK complex AMPK, preventing activation LKB1 (as illustrated Figure  2). Conversely, metabolic stress, binding AMPK KSR2 prevents Raf/MEK targeted plasma membrane activation. Alternatively, KSR2 could form independent complexes AMPK Raf/MEK. AMPK & glucose metabolism cancer cells One prominent traits cancer cells aerobic glycolysis, first described Otta Warburg 1920s [100]. Regardless adequate oxygen supply, cancer cells rely glycolysis takes place cytosol oxidative phosphorylation mito- chondria, although former much less efficient generating ATP. It still clear whether switching ATP-producing sys- tems causal consequent malignancy. Nonetheless, increased glycolysis offers many growth advantages cancer cells addition adaptation hypoxia tumor microenviron- ment [101]. For example, high rate gly- colysis required production ATP compensate impaired oxidative phosphorylation mitochondria, also important provide intermediates anabolic processes, including biosynthesis glycogen, amino acids, nucleic acids, lipids [101,102]. Second, increased glycolysis tumor cells accompanied increased stability mito- chondrial membrane. This partly ascribed mitochondria membrane associated-hexokinase (HK) I II, upregulated tumors. As result, leakage cytochrome C cytosol subsequent activation caspases prevented. As such, cancer cells resistant apoptosis invoked intrinsic pathway. Third, increased secretion lactic acid creates extracellular acidic milieu, advan- tageous cancer cell invasion toxic normal cells. Complex mechanisms involved adap- tation cancer cells glycolysis. Two impor- tant modulators relevant AMPK HIF-1 p53 (Figure 4). HIF-1 transcription factor activated hypoxic, oncogenic stresses [103]. HIF-1 heterodimer consisting two subunits, b.

AMPK activation could two effects energy metabolisms: acute effect, AMPK activated metabolic stress, hypoxia, ischemia glucose deprivation, stimulates fatty acid oxidation and, circumstances, heart, enhances glycolysis generate ATP; chronic effect, AMPK may inhibit glycolysis via action mTOR p53. Thus, suppression AMPK cancer might result increased glycolysis, may contribute Warburg effect. normal tissues, thereby offering tracing advantage 18F 2-fluoro-2-deoxy-d- glucose PET scanning, characteristic increases also targeting points cancer therapy [104]. AMP-activated protein kinase impli- cated regulation HIF1a. This may mediated action mTORC1 [105]. Thus, LKB1- AMPK-deficient fibroblasts, levels HIF1a downstream targets elevated, diminished rapa mycin [46]. A similar increase HIF1a also found epithelia gastrointestinal hamartomas LKB1+/- mice [46]. These studies suggest AMPK suppresses glycolysis tumor cells inhibiting mTOR. However, AMPK also shown stimulate glycolysis ischemic hearts activating cardiac specific enzyme, phosphofructo kinase 2 (PFK2) [106]. In addi- tion, studies asserted AMPK activa- tion upregulates HIF-1a VEGF expression hypoxia [107,108]. Thus, needs clarify whether findings reflective acute stress response examine whether net effect opposite regulations AMPK depends cellular context metabolic state cells. Another paradigm AMPK regulation glycolysis possible action p53. In addi- tion regulating cell growth apoptosis, p53 recently implicated regula- tion glyco lysis mitochondrial oxidative phosphory lation least three mecha- nisms [109]. First, p53 positively regulates expression protein synthesis cyto- chrome C oxidase 2 (SCO2), key regulator cytochrome C oxidase complex essen- tial mitochondrial respiration [110]. Second, p53 stimulates transcription TP53-induced glycolysis apoptosis regulator (TIGAR), molecule shares functional similarities bisphosphatase domain bifunctional 464 Future Oncol. (2010) 6(3) future science group AMPK metabolic tumor suppressor: control metabolism & cell growth Review enzyme 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose- 2,6-bisphosphatase [111]. Thus, upregula- tion TIGAR leads decrease levels fructose-2,6-phosphates, thereby inhibit- ing glyco lysis. Third, p53 downregulates expression phosphoglycerate mutase, another key enzyme glycolytic path way [112]. Collectively, net effect p53 mutation enhance glyco lysis. Therefore, AMPK, via regulating p53, could inhibit aerobic glycolysis thus diminish utilization glycolytic intermediates biosynthesis building blocks cancer cells (e.g., protein, lipid nucleic acids). However, data directly linking AMPK, p53 glycolysis currently still scarcity. Implication AMPK cancer prevention & treatment Many studies shown exercise, AICAR metformin, cause AMPK activation, reduce insulin secretion IGF1 production alleviate hyperlipidemia hyperglycemia [50,65,113–118]. We provided direct evidence AICAR suppresses expression IGF1 receptor prostate cancer cells, expression domi- nant negative mutant AMPK causes upregulation [50]. In addition, AMPK reduces reactive oxidation species, cause DNA damage thus induce mutagenesis [3]. Hence, studies suggest important role AMPK tumor prevention. As noted ear- lier, notion supported several recent epidemiological investigations patients Type 2 diabetes receiving metformin treatment experimental studies using animal models. AMP-activated protein kinase might also promising target cancer therapy, many recent studies shown pharmacologi- cal activators AMPK, metformin, phenformin, AICAR A769662, inhibit delay onset tumors animal models. Interestingly, one clinical study assessed response breast cancer patients diabe- tes nonadjuvant chemotherapy combina- tion metformin nonmetformin anti diabetic drugs demonstrated patients receiving metformin showed com- plete pathological responses [119]. This finding intriguing warrants investiga- tion. Indeed, expanded use metformin adjuvant treatment breast cancer patients without diabetes progress- ing Phase III clinical trial [120]. As adjuvant cancer therapy, several factors may determine efficacy pharmacological acti- vators AMPK response treatment. For example, presence LKB1 critical response cancer cells AMPK-targeted treatment. AMPK unable activated many pharmacological agents absence LKB1 unless directly bind acti- vate AMPK. In cancer cells, failure AMPK activation may beneficial therapy, sensitizes cells apoptosis induced chemotherapeutic agents [121]. Second, cells containing hyperactive downstream tar- gets AMPK might especially sensitive AMPK activators LKB1 present. These include cancer cells containing hyperactivated mTORC1 upregulated FASN [34,36,64]. In addition, status p53 might also deter- mining factor. In keeping this, recent study shown metformin induces apop- tosis p53-null HCT116 colon cancer cells selectively suppresses growth xenografts derived cells [87]. By contrast, met- formin AICAR fails inhibit tumor growth HCT116 cells containing wild-type p53 but, instead, elicits autophagy [87]. However, another study reported p53 plays criti- cal role mediating AMPK-induced apoptosis thymocytes response glucose depriva- tion [122]. These results may reflect differences cell types, points different treatment regimens needed considered genetic context varies. Conclusion In summation, AMPK appears serve metabolic tumor suppressor keep cell metabolism growth appropriate levels. Thus, response energy stress micro- environment tumors, AMPK activation may lead reprogramming cellular metabo- lism elicits metabolic checkpoint cell cycle action mTORC1, p53 modulators cell growth sur- vival. The checkpoint presumably allows cell fix problems. Thus, lost, cell undergo two directions fate: apop- tosis unrestrained growth. In regard, doubt AMPK promising target cancer prevention. Moreover, many lines evidence suggest AMPK could also serve target cancer therapy, require support preclinical clinical investigations. The clinical study beginning, hopefully, exciting outcomes expected come along near future. future science group www.futuremedicine.com 465 Review Luo, Zang & Guo Future perspective A great deal experimental studies support notion AMPK important mediator LKB1 inhibiting cancer cell growth tumorigenesis. It noteworthy, however, unlike LKB1, AMPK may emerged tumor suppressor genetic studies, probably attributed redundancy multiple isoforms [123,124]. Thus, delineate tumor suppressive function AMPK, interesting cross AMPK a1 a2 null mice transgenic mice express- ing dominant negative mutant AMPK a-subunit p53 PTEN-null mice test whether ablation AMPK accelerates tumor development whether deletion AMPK  a-genes increases susceptibility carcino- genesis. Another important direction gain evidence AMPK dysregulaton tumor microenvironment caused meta- bolic genetic changes. Inspired epi- demiological studies showing reduced risk cancer improved prognosis breast cancer patients diabetes taken metformin in vitro studies using animal models AMPK activators, extended studies metformin use adjuvant cancer ther- apy hopefully launched soon. An attrac- tive reason consider AMPK therapeu- tic target fact two pharmacological activators, metformin TZDs, already used clinical treatment Type 2 diabetes, tolerance side effects documented. Since metformin inhibits Complex I respiratory chain, one side effects production lactic acidosis. Owing fatal acidosis side effect, phenfor- min, potent analog metformin, removed market USA. Although metformin also produces side effect, much lower degree within tolerable range. Furthermore, reasonable expect AMPK activators higher specificity potency appear market near future. We aware that, tumors high degrees heterogeneity, different genetic backgrounds may determine sensitivity efficacy, combination AMPK activa- tors treatment regimens always better choice. Lastly surprisingly, tremendous interest invested, AMPK targets new functions identified.

Potter,1 Jeannette Bigler1 Bette Caan3 Martha L. Slattery2 1Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington; 2University Utah Health Sciences Center, Salt Lake City, Utah; 3Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Program, Division Research, Oakland, California Abstract Folate metabolism supports synthesis nucleotides well transfer methyl groups. Polymorphisms folate-metabolizing enzymes shown affect risk colorectal neoplasia malignancies. Using data population-based incident case-control study (1,600 cases 1,962 controls), investigated associations genetic variants reduced folate carrier (RFC), thymidylate synthase (TS), methionine synthase (MTR), 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) colon cancer risk. The TS enhancer region (TSER) variant associated reduced risk among men [2rpt/2rpt versus 3rpt/3rpt wild-type; odds ratio (OR), 0.7; 95% confidence interval, 0.6-0.98] women. When com- bined genotypes TS polymorphisms (TSER 3V-untranslated region 1494delTTAAAG) evaluated, ORs variant genotypes generally 1.0, statistically significantly reduced risks among women. Neither MTR D919G RFC 80G>A polymorphisms associated altered colon cancer risk. Because folate metabolism characterized interrelated reactions, evaluated gene-gene interactions.

The TS polymorphisms linkage disequilibrium (DV= 0.46 among non-Hispanic Caucasians). Table 2 describes main associations seen poly- morphisms, stratified gender. Among men, TSER variant genotypes associated significantly decreased risk (3rpt/2rpt: OR, 0.8; 95% CI, 0.6-0.98; 2rpt/2rpt: OR, 0.7; 95% CI, 0.6-0.98). No risk reduction observed among women. When combined genotypes (or diplotypes) TS polymorphisms considered, almost ORs variant genotypes among men women 1.0, statistically significantly reduced risks women. Risk estimates TS haplotypes, including variant alleles, compared wild-type haplotype significantly different 1.0 (data shown). Neither MTR D919G RFC 80G>A polymorphism associated altered colon cancer risk among men women (Table 2). Folate metabolism involves circulation folate metabolites multiple cycles, well feedback mechanisms cycles (Fig. 1). Therefore, evaluated gene- gene interactions polymorphisms investigated here, well reported previously (8, 13). ORs different 1.0 seen largely stratifications TS, RFC, MTR MTHFR 677C>T 1298A>C genotypes, presented Table 3. Among men, reduced risks associated variant TS genotypes (e.g., presence TSER 2rpt/2rpt TS 3V-UTR deletion) pronounced MTHFR TT genotypes. The MTHFR 1298CC genotype associated decreased risk among women; however, risk reduction seemed independent TS genotypes. There evidence interactions MTR D919G RFC 80G>A MTHFR genotypes. We also investigated whether risk estimates associated polymorphisms folate-metabolizing enzymes differed dietary intakes folate, methionine, alcohol, vitamins B6, B2, B12. Consistent previous report colorectal adenoma (37) among men, TSER variant conferred reduced risk presence low folate intake (lowest tertile < 318 Ag/d; TS 2rpt/2rpt 2rpt/3rpt: OR, 0.7; 95% CI, 0.5-0.9 compared wild-type 3rpt/3rpt). A similar risk reduction TSER variant genotypes observed among men low methionine intakes (<2.0 g/d): TS 2rpt/2rpt 2rpt/3rpt (OR, 0.6; 95% CI, 0.4-0.9) compared wild-type 3rpt/3rpt. However, none patterns observed among women TS genotypes TS haplotypes either sex. There clear patterns associations following stratification vitamin B6 B12 intake. No meaningful differences risk observed MTR genotypes stratified nutrient intakes. Among women lowest tertile folate intake (V273 Ag/d), RFC variant genotypes associated decreased risk (wild-type GG: OR, 1.0; GA AA: OR, 0.7; 95% CI, 0.5-1.0).

P = 0.03 (Wald The presence two common functional variants within TS suggests essential take account simultaneously. The MTR polymorphism less common (allele frequency = 0.20) investigated three epidemiologic studies, including large Norwegian cohort (7, 25, 45). Similar findings, Le Marchand et al. (45) Chen et al. (7) report associations variant colon cancer risk, whereas Ulvik et al. (25) observed significantly reduced risk among GG genotype compared wild- type AA (OR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.47-0.90). We observed reduced risks among men (OR, 0.7), 95% CI included 1.0. As 5% population homozygous variant genotype, large studies needed quantify strength association. For gene-gene interactions, combinations MTHFR polymorphisms showed interesting patterns. This surprising, MTHFR key regulatory enzyme folate-mediated one-carbon metabolism, activity determines distribution folate metabolites toward nucleotide synthesis methylation reactions. There strong evidence MTHFR 677C>T variant alters balance metabolites within pathway (39, 46). In combined analyses TS MTHFR polymorphisms, observed men carrying least one variant TS allele (either TSER 2rpt TS 1494del) addition MTHFR 677TT genotype relatively lowest risk compared groups (both OR, 0.6; 95% CI, 0.4-0.9). This confirms previous observation colorectal adenoma, individuals low TS expression low MTHFR activity genotypes also experienced lowest adenoma risk (OR, 0.56; ref. 10). If statistical interaction reflects biological mechanisms, may hypothesize observed pattern suggests greater diversion folate metabolites (specifically 5,10- methylene-tetrahydrofolate) toward purine synthesis pro- tective development colorectal neoplasia. Recent findings Quinlivan et al. suggest folate depletion adversely affects purine synthesis humans greater relative rate adenine synthesis among individuals MTHFR TT genotype (46). Depurination common type DNA damage f10,000 depurinations/cell/d (47, 48). Although efficiently repaired, apurinic sites present DNA. We recognize one study observe risk pattern, sample size limited 270 cases, consequent restricted power studying gene- gene interactions (43). Our investigations gene-diet interactions confirmed, extent, associations previously observed respect TSER, folate intake reduced TS expression (TSER 2rpt/2rpt) associated reduced risk presence low folate intake (10). However, pattern seen among men also observed Health Professionals study (43). Again, pattern reflects biological mechanism, would point toward purine synthesis key link one-carbon metabolism colorectal neoplasia. We unable confirm previously observed gene-diet interactions MTR colorectal adenoma (26) see clear pattern RFC-diet interactions. However, RFC transporter naturally occurring folates (in form 5-methyl-tetrahydrofolate) plays smaller role transport folic acid (49). Thus, populations, one described here, folate intake supplements form folic acid comprises substantial proportion overall folate intake, genetic variability RFC may relevant overall supply folate metabolites. Unfortunately, quantitative information supplement use available population. Lastly, observed differences risk patterns dependent past use postmenopausal hormones. Interactions folate metabolism PMH use implausible, links homocysteine concentrations PMH use (50-53), methylation estrogen receptor early event colorectal carcinogenesis, may less frequently occur presence PMH (27, 54). We previously reported significant difference risk patterns PMH-associated risks MTHFR genotypes (13). However, interactions need confirmed others, sample sizes parts insufficient yield stable estimates. Although study quite comprehensive respect investigations genetic variability one-carbon metabolism risk colon cancer, three important limitations. First, investigations include genetic poly- morphisms folate-metabolizing enzymes may possible relevance, methionine-synthase reductase (MTRR) serine-hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT). Thus far, MTRR seem related colon cancer risk (45), functional relevance cSHMT polymorphisms unclear. The study presented focused candidate polymorphisms key enzymes substantial evidence functional effect; hope expand investigations relevant candidate polymorphisms reported. Second, strong evidence subset colorectal cancer cases arises part CpG island methylator phenotype (55, 56). Information CpG island methylator phenotype status taken account future studies investigating links genetic variability folate metab- olism risk colorectal cancer. A final limitation current inability integrate knowledge biochemical relationships within pathway statistical analysis. Although approach uses stratification gene-nutrient gene-gene interactions valuable, allows empirical investigation associations, also limited statistical power higher-order interactions lacking, even within large Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev 2005;14(11).

Because folate metabolism consists several interconnected cycles (see Fig. 1), interactions expected. Our approach toward solving problem use, future, results mathematical model one-carbon biochemistry investigations multiple genetic variants selected biomarkers. Although model still development, preliminary results show replicates biochemical relationships folate cycle methio- nine cycle reasonable accuracy (57, 58). Furthermore, group others developing methods address key problem molecular epidemiologic studies (59). Thus, hope future, able achieve closer integration biochemistry statistical analysis. Because strong evidence disturbances biochemical pathway modify risk several types malignancies (60-63), birth outcomes (64-66), possibly cardiovascular disease (67) autism (68), thorough understanding interplay multiple genetic polymorphisms specific dietary conditions combined effect bio- markers disease end points highly relevant.

Introduction The biological actions 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25(OH)2D3] mediated largely, entirely, vitamin D receptor (VDR), member super- family nuclear hormone receptors (Whitﬁeld et al., 1999). This protein found tissues known play role calcium homeostasis, also numerous tissues, appears regulate variety processes, including cell proliferation differentia- tion (Haussler et al., 1998).

A simpliﬁed diagram illustrates nuclear hVDR mediates transcriptional activation 1,25(OH)2D3 hormone shown Fig. 1A. The key features model are: (i) liganding nuclear VDR * Corresponding author: Tel.: +1-520-6266033; fax: +1-520- 6269015. E-mail address: haussler@u.arizona.edu (M.R.

For purposes present communica- tion, relevant regions hVDR hor- mone-binding domain, encoded exons VI–IX human gene (see also Fig. 2), DNA binding domain/ zinc ﬁngers, encoded exons II–IV, set discontinuous transactivation domains, including re- gions N-terminus (for TFIIB docking) (Jurutka et al., 2000), helices 3 12 (for coactivator recruitment). Since transactivation ultimate bio- chemical action liganded VDR depends capabilities receptor (ligand binding, nuclear localization, heterodimerization VDRE/ DNA binding), present study focuses parame- ter receptor activity order probe functional signiﬁcance hVDR gene polymorphisms. The chromosomal gene VDR cloned (Miyamoto et al., 1997), several common genetic variants described humans, identiﬁed biallelic variation restriction endonuclease site (Fig. 2). Genetic variation 3% region hVDR gene observed speciﬁc intronic sites Bsm I (Morrison et al., 1992) Apa I (Faraco et al., 1989), silent Taq I site exon IX (Morrison et al., 1992), well singlet(A) repeat portion exon IX encoding 3% UTR (Ingles et al., 1997a) (see Fig. 2, right). All variations near 3% end gene linkage disequilibrium (Morrison et al., 1992; Verbeek et al., 1997), although linkage weaker ethnic groups African-Americans (Ingles et al., 1997a). Interestingly, none poly- morphisms affect structure VDR protein itself, although singlet(A) repeat 3% UTR expressed mature mRNA hVDR. Singlet(A) variants classiﬁed according length number consec- utive A’s repeat, ]17 A’s scored ‘long’ (L), 515 A’s considered ‘short’ (S). Another polymorphic site found exon II near center hVDR gene (Saijo et al., 1991). This site, genetically unlinked Bsm/Apa/ Taq/singlet(A) cluster, unique among common hVDR variants described far, results alteration hVDR protein structure (Fig. 2, bottom center). Presence Fok I site (designated f ) predicts 427-residue VDR protein produced beginning Met-1 (M1 according numbering scheme Baker et al. (1988), whereas absence site (denoted F) dictates translation Met-4 (M4), producing protein 424 amino acids (Arai et al., 1997).

Another group (Colin et al., 2000) also studied F versus f hVDR proteins, reported lower ED50 1,25(OH)2D3 F allele. These data indicating active F hVDR allele consistent number epidemiological studies suggest F allele, compared f allele, associated increased BMD (Gross et al., 1996; Arai et al., 1997; Harris et al., 1997; Tao et al., 1998; Ferrari et al., 1999; Lucotte et al., 1999), higher rates bone turnover (Kurabayashi et al., 1999), lower risk primary hyperparathyroidism (Correa et al., 1999; Sosa et al., 2000), lower risk intervertebral disc degeneration (Videman et al., 1998) lower incidence vertebral fracture (Gennari et al., 1999). However, acknowledged studies found associations. For instance, one group (Eccleshall et al., 1998) observe correlation hVDR genotype BMD large cohort French women. Also, another group (Gross et al., 1998) unable correlate hVDR- related functional parameter F/f genotype either cells transfected vectors expressing F versus f hVDRs, small panel human ﬁbroblast lines, although perhaps methodological limita- tions, small differences activity may escaped detection.

However, plot modiﬁed allele score (F+S) versus transcriptional activity appeared show inverse correlation hVDR allele score bioactivity (data shown). This exercise, plus present data (Fig. 6 Fig. 8), strongly support premise L active hVDR allele. Since polymorphism occurs exon IX, expressed 3% UTR hVDR mRNA, working hypothesis presented herein states L allele may produce receptor mRNA stable and/or translated efﬁciently hVDR protein S allele. Pertinent hypothesis above, mRNA stabil- ities allelic variants adjacent exon IX [i.e., considering one sites Bsm/Taq/Apa/sin- glet(A) cluster] evaluated recent studies using various (Morrison et al., 1994; Mocharla et al., 1997; Verbeek et al., 1997; Carling et al., 1998; Gross et al., 1998; Durrin et al., 1999). strategies 154 G. Kerr Whitﬁeld et al. /Molecular Cellular Endocrinology 177 (2001) 145–159 investigations, Mirroring epidemiological studies yielded conﬂicting results. In one set experiments (Verbeek et al., 1997), lymphocytes het- erozygous Taq polymorphism examined. It found that, whereas mRNA stabilities similar alleles, mRNA allele (linked S) consistently 30% less abundant. This result interpreted suggesting possible difference tran- scriptional regulation two allelic forms studied, although mechanism effect proposed (Verbeek et al., 1997). In contrast, another study (Carling et al., 1998) examining pituitary ade- nomas 42 patients showed B alleles associated higher hVDR mRNA levels, reaching statistical signiﬁcance homozygous BB tt lines compared bb TT homozygotes. Results similar Carling et al. obtained others (Morrison et al., 1994), using heterologous system 3.2 kb 3% UTR two subjects homozygous either BAtS baTL linked luciferase reporter gene. In transfected COS-7 cells, BAtS construct displayed higher luciferase activity, sug- gesting authors either transcriptional ac- tivity construct itself, mRNA stability transcript, favorably affected attachment BAtS opposed baTL 3% UTR (Morrison et al., 1994). Finally, three groups reported signiﬁcant effect 3% UTR allelic variants hVDR mRNA. These studies examined B versus b mRNA abundance blood monocytes (Mocharla et al., 1997), B versus b hVDR protein mRNA abundance cultured skin ﬁbroblasts (Gross et al., 1998), stabil- ity globin mRNAs attached L S 3% UTRs transfected NIH3T3 cells (Durrin et al., 1999). In par- ticular, last study, methodology similar Morrison et al. used, strongly suggests baTL BAtS 3% UTRs confer different mRNA stabilities, least attached het- erologous (rabbit b globin) mRNA (Durrin et al., 1999). Drawing conclusions investigations respect L/S polymorphism must done cautiously, since two six studies cited (Morrison et al., 1994; Durrin et al., 1999) actually determined L/S genotype subjects. Neverthe- less, given reasonably tight linkage Bsm I singlet(A) polymorphisms (Ingles et al., 1997a), discussed results, taken together, sug- gest mRNA stability may major mecha- nism distinguishing activity L versus S alleles. The possibility remains, however, L allele fashion produces VDR protein given unit mRNA. While paucity data support refute conclusion, notable ligand binding assays (Gross et al., 1998) seem indicate trend toward higher VDR abundance (ex- differences pressed Nmax) bb versus BB ﬁbroblast lines, al- though statistically signiﬁcant. Should case L alleles (linked b) produce hVDR protein, could mechanism effect? Recent observations regarding mammalian yeast poly(A) binding proteins (PABPs) indicate binding PABP mRNA enhances translatability mRNAs via in- teraction proteins interact 5% end message (Munroe Jacobson, 1990; Le et al., 1997). Usually, multiple PABP monomers bind poly(A)+ RNAs, monomer occupying ap- proximately 27 adenylate residues (Baer Kornberg, 1980). Intriguingly, studies human PABP suggest 11 consecutive A’s bind PABP, 25 A’s giving maximum afﬁnity (Deo et al., 1999). Thus, one could speculate that: (a) PABP may capable binding singlet(A) repeat hVDR gene; (b) ability bind may enhanced long (L) alleles (17–24 A’s) versus short (S) alleles (10–15 A’s). Greater association PABP L alle- les would lead efﬁcacious translation via potent interaction translation factors EF-4B (Le et al., 1997). using 1,25(OH)2D3-responsive Regardless potential mechanism, endoge- nous VDR activities, measured present experi- ments reporter plasmid, showed surprising range activities, 1.75- 100-fold induction 1,25(OH)2D3 It as- serted current results valid comparing cell lines within studied group, particularly data normalized transfection efﬁciency monitored inclusion expression plasmid b-galactosidase. It possible, nonetheless, presence four closely-spaced vitamin D responsive elements (CT4)4TKGH reporter construct used could exaggerate small differences activity may much subtle vivo conditions, espe- cially considering natural promoters often possess single, most, two vitamin D responsive elements (Haussler et al., 1998). Indeed, results BGP-TKGH, contains single VDRE element, revealed modest transactivation levels trans- fected cells (see Fig. 7A) less dramatic difference F versus f hVDR activity. The absence current sample set cell line allele score zero (i.e. ffSS) notable allow evaluation activity genotype. The obvious explanation absence fact that, since hVDR ff SS homozygotes relatively uncommon among Caucasians (19 15%, respectively), combination ffSS would, therefore, represent rare genotype (estimated frequency 3% Caucasians). Given observed correlation be- tween allele score fold-induction 1,25(OH)2D3 (Fig. 8B), predicted cells genotype G. Kerr Whitﬁeld et al. /Molecular Cellular Endocrinology 177 (2001) 145–159 155 would low relative transcriptional activity. A recent epidemiological study (Hutchinson et al., 2000), large cohort malignant melanoma genotyped T/t F/f loci, supports conclu- sion. It found fftt (recall often linked S) signiﬁcantly thicker tumors (P=0.001). These results intimate fftt allele combination might associated less active hVDR, VDR reported antiproliferative effects might expected counter malignant phenotype (Haussler et al., 1998). Clearly, ﬁbroblast lines must examined answer questions, interesting determine ffSS hVDR cell lines actually possess low hVDR activity. Should case, provocative possibility could raised rare ffSS hVDR genotype might disadvanta- geous respect calcium bone metabolism sharply reduced gene pool. The two ﬁbroblast lines present panel patients William’s Syndrome exhibited differ- ent hVDR activities, endogenous VDR DWF-CV line displaying extremely high (100-fold) in- duction 1,25(OH)2D3, DWF-TW line dis- playing near-average activity (23-fold induction). The extremely high activity DWF-CV line (three standard deviations mean 28924 fold-in- duction) suggests possible association hyper- calcemia often seen patients William’s Syndrome. However, great majority William’s Syndrome cases involve chromosomal dele- tion 7q11.23 (Ewart et al., 1993), hVDR gene resides chromosome 12, syndrome would appear unrelated VDR action (as seems case patient DWF-TW). However, con- ceivable patient DWF-CV, whose ﬁbroblasts ex- hibit extremely elevated VDR activity, may represent atypical William’s case involve increased sensitivity 1,25(OH)2D3, mechanism al- ready speculated isolated cases resembling Williams’s Syndrome (Ghirri et al., 1999). Concerning three osteoporotic patients current sample set, two ﬁbroblast lines showed normal hVDR activity, third (Ran Nor, 69-year- old male) displayed low induction reporter gene (6.2-fold versus average 28-fold). The low activity hVDR Ran Nor cell sample could, theory, related low bone density osteoporo- sis. However, osteoporosis multifactorial disease and, therefore, large study would required test relationship etiology hVDR alleles. The lowest induction tested reporter construct 1,25(OH)2D3 (1.75-fold) observed trans- fected cell line HS 144.We, taken 5-week-old embryo. These cells represent one two prenatal cell lines present panel; thus, one possible explana- tion low hVDR activity cells early gestational stage may yet differentiated sufﬁciently express VDR levels seen postnatally. However, fetal cell line, HE-SK (exact fetal age unknown), displayed slightly average in- duction 35.4-fold. Further arguing interpretation observation laboratory that, exception tissues like intestine phenotypically responsive vitamin D adult, VDR expression actually shown diminish rat chick tissues muscle liver mature beyond embryonic stage (M.R. Haussler K. Yamaoka, unpublished data). Other groups also observed VDR expression various embry- onic fetal tissues (Takeuchi et al., 1994; Johnson et al., 1995; Delvin et al., 1996; Johnson et al., 1996; Veenstra et al., 1998; Segura et al., 1999). Finally, given HS 144.We line allele score 1 (genotype FfSS), observed fold-induction 1.75 resides predicted value 5.3-fold stimula- tion 1,25(OH)2D3 using regression line 19 lines, prediction negligible stimulation (i.e. close 1.0-fold) ‘low group’ regression line (both values calculated plots similar Fig. 8B, omitting HS 144.We data point). Thus, observed HS 144.We hVDR transcriptional activity outside predicted range allele score. Regardless, data rule early developmen- tal-stage variations human VDR expression, topic deserves study. The presence two distinct groupings hVDR activity versus allele score F/f plus L/S loci Fig. 8B argues favor existence another variable inﬂuences innate hVDR activity, least ﬁbroblasts. There number potential variables consider, including parameters age sex patients cells taken. An analysis variables current sample set reveals that, although gender distribution high low groups Fig. 8B similar (60 50% male, respectively), average age somewhat higher low group, difference without statistical signiﬁcance (20.9 versus 4.8 years, P=0.11). Thus, based current data, contended age sex cell donors would satisfactory explanations existence high low activity group. Instead, hypothesis put forth present com- munication (Fig. 9) exists one additional polymorphic variations hVDR gene beyond F/f locus 3% cluster (Apa/Bsm/Taq L/S) affect(s) hVDR activity. The coding exons hVDR gene studied rather extensively, yielded numerous point mutations causing hereditary vitamin D resistant rickets (Hawa et al., 1996; Lin et al., 1996; Whitﬁeld et al., 156 G. Kerr Whitﬁeld et al. /Molecular Cellular Endocrinology 177 (2001) 145–159 1996; Haussler et al., 1998), evidence presented occurrence common polymorphic sites Fok I site exon II linked cluster sites exon VIII–IX region. Yet recent investigations portion hVDR gene en- coding 5% untranslated region (5% UTR) re- vealed surprising complex least seven exons (denoted IA-IG, see Fig. 9, top left), evidence alternative splicing (Miyamoto et al., 1997; Crofts et al., 1998). It possible undiscovered common polymorphic sites may exist newly described complex multiple exons 5% end gene. Such polymorphisms could even alter VDR protein structure introducing in-frame initiator methionine codons leading expression VDRs N-ter- minal extensions, already proposed one research group (Crofts et al., 1998). Still another possibility polymorphisms 5% region VDR gene might affect activity one three proposed hVDR promoters (Crofts et al., 1998), leading expression altered quantities VDR proteins physiologic conditions. Here again, precedent exists recent report (Arai et al., 1999 J. Bone Miner. Res. 14, S191, Abstract T084), describes polymorphism binding site Cdx-2, homeodomain protein related caudal (posi- tion Cdx binding site hVDR gene shown Fig. 9, top left). The importance Cdx-2 intestine- speciﬁc expression hVDR demonstrated earlier (Yamamoto et al., 1999). It is, course, possible invoke polymorphism explain present results ﬁbroblast lines, given intestine-speciﬁc nature Cdx-2 regulated expression (Suh et al., 1994). However, existence polymorphism certainly considered epidemiological studies relating VDR-me- diated intestinal absorption calcium phosphate impact BMD parathyroid gland function. Indeed, large cohort Japanese women, A allele Cdx-2 locus correlated higher BMD lumbar spine, consistent slightly greater activity VDR promoter construct incorporating Cdx-A type element (Arai et al., 1999, J. Bone Miner. Res. 14, S191, Abstract T084). Rather evoking Cdx-2 known polymorphism explain present results, prefer interpretation novel polymorphism exists, likely located incompletely characterized 5% re- gion hVDR gene. A full recognition genetic complexity VDR action humans may eventually allow accurate prediction VDR activ- Fig. 9. Summary common polymorphic variations hVDR gene may inﬂuence VDR activity. The exon arrangement (top) described Fig. 2 associated text. The long (L) variant singlet(A) repeat exon IX proposed herein associated increased VDR amount. A speculative mechanism effect enhanced ability ]17 consecutive As recruit poly(A) binding protein, would presumably stabilize VDR mRNA and/or promote translation hVDR protein (see text). The F/f polymorphism exon II likewise shown associated VDR activity, F isoform displaying moderately higher transcriptional activity, well measurably greater interaction, vitro, TFIIB (Jurutka et al., 2000). Recently, third hVDR polymorphism described upstream exon IG binding site intestine-speciﬁc enhancer protein Cdx-2 (Arai et al., 1999, J. Bone Miner. Res. 14, S191, Abstract T084). This polymorphism may signiﬁcant effects hVDR expression intestinal cells (Yamamoto et al., 1999). All three illustrated polymorphisms proposed affect either quantity expressed VDR human tissues (Cdx-2 L/S), ability VDR interact proteins TFIIB (F/f, illustrated bottom right), order impact transcription target genes. Finally, suggested functionally relevant VDR gene polymorphisms may exist, especially recently-described complex exons encoding 5%-UTR. G.

We modeled diet physical activity GWAS order identify novel loci affecting total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglyceride levels. The Swedish (SE) EUROSPAN cohort (NSE = 656) screened candidate genes non-Swedish (NS) EUROSPAN cohorts (NNS = 3,282) used replication. In total, 3 SNPs associated Swedish sample replicated non-Swedish cohorts. While SNP rs1532624 replication previously published association CETP HDL cholesterol, two novel findings. For latter SNPs, p-value association substantially improved inclusion environmental covariates: SNP rs5400 (pSE,unadjusted = 3.661025, pSE,adjusted = 2.261026, pNS,unadjusted = 0.047) SLC2A2 (Glucose transporter type 2) rs2000999 (pSE,unadjusted = 1.161023, pSE,adjusted = 3.861024, pNS,unadjusted = 0.035) HP gene (Haptoglobin-related protein precursor). Both showed evidence association total cholesterol. These results demonstrate inclusion important environmental factors analysis model reveal new genetic susceptibility loci.

These studies modeled basic anthropometric con- founders, sex age, leaving important low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (TC), environmental influences, diet activity. This strategy statistically suboptimal since unexplained variation phenotype increase measurement error result require larger sample sizes detect significant effect. Manolio [4] argued strongly modeling environmental covariates GWAS recommended lipid levels paradigmatic phenotype studying genetic environmental architecture quantitative traits. PLoS Genetics | www.plosgenetics.org 1 January 2010 | Volume 6 | Issue 1 | e1000798 Author Summary In article report genome-wide association study cholesterol levels human blood. We used Swedish cohort select genetic polymorphisms showed strongest association cholesterol levels adjusted diet physical activity. We replicated several genetic loci European cohorts. This approach extends present genome-wide association stud- ies lipid levels, take lifestyle factors account, improve statistical results discover novel genes. In analysis, could identify two genetic loci SLC2A2 (Glucose transporter type 2) HP (Haptoglobin-related protein precursor) gene whose ef- fects total cholesterol reported yet. The results show inclusion important environmental factors analysis model reveal new insights genetic determinants clinical parameters relevant metabolic cardiovascular disease. In order explore usefulness including environ- mental genetic factors analysis model, used lipid measurements EUROSPAN study, comprising 3,938 individuals genome-wide SNP data (NSNP = 311,388) available [5]. We measured daily intake food physical activity work leisure modeled influence environmental covariates serum lipid levels GWAS. First, data Northern Sweden Population Health Study (NSPHS) used discovery cohort screen SNPs displayed lowest p-values model adjusted environmental covariates. We used other, non-Swedish EUROSPAN cohorts replication strongest associations candidate gene association study (CGAS). shows We chose population living northern Sweden selection candidate loci strong natural heterogeneity certain lifestyle factors (e.g. diet, activity), homogeneity environmental aspects climate [6]. Whereas one group living modern, sedentary lifestyle found also southern part Sweden western European countries, subgroup Swedes follows traditional, semi- nomadic way life based reindeer herding. Reindeer herders typically show higher intake game meat (reindeer, moose), high protein low fat content, lower intake non-game meat, lesser differences. They also exert physical activity work tend reindeer herds, less activity leisure [7]. fish, dairy products among other, Results Exploratory GWAS NSPHS We performed GWAS lifestyle-adjusted model included sex age, also daily intake game meat, non-game meat, fish, milk products, physical activity work leisure covariates. We focused 0.05% SNPs lowest p-values diet- activity-adjusted model (corresponding 150 SNPs per lipid). For total cholesterol, 88 located gene 14 genes associated energy metabolism (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih. gov/omim/). For LDL-C, 65 SNPs located gene, 8 functionally relevant. Several SNPs LDL- C identical affecting total cholesterol, expected high correlation (r = 0.91) phenotypes. For HDL-C, SNP rs2292883, located MLPH gene (Melanophi- lin), showed genome-wide significant p-value (p = 1.06610207). Modeling Environmental Effects GWAS 69 SNPs HDL-C located gene 14 genes reported metabolic effect. Finally, triglycerides, 63 SNPs located gene, 4 SNPs genes functional annotation interest (Table 1 Table S1A, S1B, S1C, S1D). P-value changes In order evaluate effect including diet activity covariates association analysis, overlaid p-values Manhattan plots NSPHS unadjusted adjusted GWAS models (Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4). More refined GWAS results separating effect adjusting either diet physical activity presented Figure S1A, S1B, S1C, S1D; Figure S2A, S2B, S2C, S2D. As expected, p-values number SNPs sensitive inclusion diet activity covariates model. We matched 0.05% SNPs lowest p-values (top SNP list) unadjusted adjusted model. For TC, 83 (53%) SNPs found top SNP lists. Those lists contained 102 (64%) identical SNPs LDL-C 103 (65%) HDL-C. The analyses resulted 74 (47%) top SNPs TG levels (Table S1A, S1B, S1C, S1D). Finally, compared p-value changes resulting 39 candidate SNPs located genes metabolic effect diet activity- adjusted (full) model unadjusted (restricted) model resulting 27-fold p-value decrease (Table 1).

Therefore, conducted GWAS, modeling genetic important environmental effects, food intake physical activity, serum levels classical lipids. To knowledge, first GWAS blood lipid levels modeling environmental factors, particular major food categories physical activity, international cohorts. Our analysis replicated one known locus CETP gene [1] SLC2A2 HP gene, identified two gene loci respectively, involved energy metabolism previously reported associated cholesterol levels. SLC2A2 encodes facilitated glucose transporter member 2 (GLUT-2, Solute carrier family 2) predominantly expressed liver. Mice deficient GLUT-2 hyperglycemic elevated plasma levels glucagon free fatty acids [10]. Mutations GLUT-2 cause Fanconi-Bickel syndrome (FBS) characterized hypercholesterolemia hyperlipidemia [11,12].

As result, glucose stimulation insulin exocytosis impaired causing hyperglycemia, clinical hallmark type 2 diabetes. In addition, Kilpelainen et al.

First, aware candidate gene association approach covers small fraction genomic loci, one potential reasons classical lipid-influencing genes, APOE, represented candidate SNP list. Therefore, approach comprehensive may failed identify relevant lifestyle-sensitive genetic variants. Nonetheless, decided apply approach make best available lifestyle data. Second, study provides limited information role individual lifestyle factors genetic variant. However, study aimed amplifying genetic effects adjusting maximum amount environmental variance single model and, therefore, neglected aspects here. Third, model genetic covariates known lipid-relevant genes may also moderate effect genetic predictors. This due focus paper gene-environment relationships. In summary, demonstrated modeling environmen- tal factors, particular major food categories physical activity, improve statistical power lead discovery novel susceptibility loci. Such models also provide understanding complex interplay genetic environmental factors affecting human quantitative traits. Inclusion environmental covariates represents much needed next step quest model complete environmental genetic architecture complex traits.

Diet In NSPHS cohort, collected data food frequency questionnaire based Northern Sweden 84-item Food Frequency Questionnaire (NoS-84-FFQ) [26]. We included questionnaire several items foods specific lifestyle geographic region, particular game consumption (reindeer, moose). The answer options consisted 11-point format: 0 = ‘‘Never’’, 1 = ‘‘less 1 time per month’’, 2 = ‘‘1 3 times per month’’, 3 = ‘‘1 time per week’’, 4 = ‘‘2 4 times per week’’, 5 = ‘‘5 6 times per week’’, 6 = ‘‘1 time per day’’, 7 = ‘‘2 3 times per day’’, 8 = ‘‘4 5 times per day’’, 9 = ‘‘6 8 times per day’’, 10 = ‘‘9 10 times per day’’. The questionnaire applied electronic format trained study nurse interviewer. For food item calculated daily intake gram per day standardized unit measurement aggregated items food categories, game meat, non-game meat, fish, dairy products. We evaluated construct validity (known-groups validity) added items game consumption NoS-84- FFQ questionnaire. We compared reindeer herders (N = 94) versus non-reindeer herders (N = 505). We observed highly significant, large effect sizes men (ES = 1.25, p = 9.7610204) women (ES = 1.15, p = 2.9610205) expected direction correspond- ing approximately three times higher consumption absolute overall game intake reindeer herders compared others. A similar approach used measurement analysis dietary data collected food frequency questionnaire Scottish cohort (Table S2). Physical activity In NSPHS cohort, used two self-report scales measure overall physical activity work leisure. The Work Activity Scale (WAS, 6 items) addresses typical occupational physical activities: sitting, standing, walking, lifting, general indicators physical activity, i. e. sweating tiredness work. The Leisure Activity Scale (LAS, 4 items) asks various typical freetime activities walking, cycling, sporting activities, sweating general indicator physical activity. Participants reported frequency activity 5-point rating scale (1 = ‘‘never’’, 2 = ‘‘seldom’’, 3 = ‘‘sometimes’’, 4 = ‘‘of- ten’’, 5 = ‘‘always’’). Both scales showed satisfying internal consistency Cronbach’s a(WAS) = 0.73 Cronbach’s a(LAS) = 0.70.

Statistical methods We tested association log-transformed plasma one-carbon metabolite levels SNP using linear regression adjusted age. SNP genotypes coded counts minor alleles (additive coding) unless otherwise speciﬁed. We adopted additive coding nearly optimal power range realistic genetic models, exception rare recessive effects, little power detect (92). In CGEMS, adjusted principal components genetic variation, calculated EIGENSTRAT software (91). The SHARe data analyzed using linear mixed effects models account residual familial correlation; aside ﬁxed effects (age, SNP genotype), model includes individual random effects correlation matrix equal kinship matrix times scalar variance parameter. These analyses implemented using lmekin function R package kinship. We imputed SNP genotypes using hidden Markov model implemented MACH 1.0 (http://www.sph.umich .edu/csg/abecasis/MACH/index.html) CGEMS SHARe separately. For SHARe data, hidden Markov model trained using unrelated founders (922 women 692 biologically unrelated men); ﬁtted model used infer missing genotypes remaining subjects. The certainty imputation dependent stretches haplotypes shared reference panel (HapMap Phase II CEU population) study population. The imputation result imputed SNPs, per study par- ticipant, expressed set three genotype probabil- ities, vary 0 1 per genotype sum 1, ‘allele dosage’, deﬁned expected number copies minor allele SNP varies 0 2.

We found copy number salivary amylase gene (AMY1) correlated positively salivary amylase protein level individuals populations high-starch diets have, average, AMY1 copies traditionally low-starch diets. Comparisons loci subset populations suggest extent AMY1 copy number differentiation highly unusual. This example positive selection copy number–variable gene is, knowledge, one ﬁrst discovered human genome.

To determine AMY1 copy number differs among populations high- low-starch diets, estimated AMY1 copy number three high-starch four low- starch population samples.

More importantly, WGTP data, able compare extent population differentiation AMY1 locus loci genome two Asian population samples study. We would expect magnitude direction Japanese- Yakut mean log2 ratio difference AMY1-mapped clones similar copy number–variable clones, CNVs experienced similar evolutionary pressures. However, two AMY1-mapped clones signiﬁcant outliers distribution (Fig. 4b Supplementary Fig. 2 online), leading us reject null hypothesis. In addition, considered database genotypes 783 genome-wide microsatellites Yakut individuals different Japanese population sample13, microsatellite loci usually multiallelic (as AMY1 locus). We found extent Japanese-Yakut differentiation AMY1 locus exceeded 497% microsatellite loci (Supplementary Fig. 3 online). Although result interpreted caution know whether AMY1 copy number microsatellite muta- tion rates patterns similar, ﬁnding consistent results WGTP comparison. These observations suggest natural selection shaped AMY1 copy number variation either Japanese Yakut populations. We cannot fully test null hypothesis high- low-starch populations study, patterns copy number variation observed populations similar Japanese Yakut thus may also reﬂect non-neutral evolution. We favor model AMY1 copy number subject positive directional selection least high-starch populations evolved neutrally (that is, genetic drift) low-starch populations. Although possible lower AMY1 gene copy numbers favored selection low-starch popula- tions, interpretation less plausible simple reason excessive amylase production unlikely signiﬁcant negative effect ﬁtness. Furthermore, several lines evidence offer mechan- isms higher salivary amylase protein expression may confer ﬁtness advantage individuals high-starch diet. First, signiﬁcant amount starch digestion occurs mouth mastication14. For example, blood glucose shown signiﬁcantly higher high-starch foods corn, rice potatoes (but low-starch foods apples) ﬁrst chewed swallowed, rather swallowed directly15. In addition, suggested oral digestion starch critically important energy absorption episodes diarrhea4. Diarrheal diseases signiﬁcant effect ﬁtness; example, diseases caused 15% worldwide deaths among children younger 5 years recently 2001 (ref. 16). Last, salivary amylase persists stomach intestines swallowing17, thereby augmenting enzymatic activity pancreatic amylase small intestine. Higher AMY1 copy number concomitant increase salivary amylase protein thus likely improve efﬁciency high- starch foods digested mouth, stomach intestines may also buffer potential ﬁtness-reducing effects intestinal disease.

Therefore, average human roughly three times AMY1 copies chimpanzees, bonobos may salivary amylase all. Outgroup comparisons great apes suggest AMY1 copy number probably gained human lineage, rather lost chimpanzees21,22. Given AMY1 copy number positively correlated salivary amylase protein expression humans, stands reason human-speciﬁc increase copy number may explain, least part, salivary amylase protein levels approximately six eight times higher humans chimpanzees23. These patterns consistent general dietary characteristics Pan Homo; chimpanzees bonobos predominantly frugivorous ingest little starch relative human populations24. Among primates, New World monkeys produce salivary amylase tend consume little starch, cercopithecines (a subfamily Old World monkeys including macaques 1 2 5 8 VOLUME 39 [ NUMBER 10 [ OCTOBER 2007 NATURE GENETICS / c e e g e r u c . e r u w w w . l b u P e r u N 7 0 0 2 © / / : p h p u r G g h L E T T E R S mangabeys) relatively high salivary amylase expression, even compared humans23. Although genetic mechanisms unknown, expression pattern may evolved facilitate digestion starchy foods (such seeds unripe fruits) stowed cheek pouch, trait that, among primates, unique cercopithecines25. The initial human-speciﬁc increase AMY1 copy number may coincident dietary shift early hominin evolu- tionary history. For example, hypothesized starch-rich plant underground storage organs (USOs) bulbs, corms tubers critical food resource early hominins26,27. Changes USO consumption may even facilitated initial emergence spread Homo erectus Africa5,28. Yet arguments difﬁcult test, mainly direct evidence use USOs difﬁcult obtain, particularly remote time periods. USOs perishable, many tools used collect process them. Therefore, understanding timing nature initial human-lineage AMY1 duplications may provide insight ecological evolutionary history. The low amount nucleotide sequence divergence among three AMY1 gene copies found human genome reference sequence (hg18; ¼ 0.00011 0.00056) implies relatively recent origin may within time frame modern human origins (that is, within last B200,000 years; based human-chimpanzee AMY1 ¼ 0.027 using estimate 6 million years ago divergence human chimpanzee lineages). However, given possibility gene conversion, necessarily consider estimate reliable. The generation AMY1 sequences multiple humans may ultimately help shed light issue. In summary, shown pattern variation copy number human AMY1 gene consistent history diet- related selection pressures, demonstrating importance starchy foods human evolution. Although amylase locus one variable human genome regard copy number10, means unique; recent genome-wide survey identiﬁed 1,447 copy number–variable regions among 270 pheno- typically normal human individuals11, many regions likely discovered advances copy number variation detection technology. It reasonable speculate copy number variants AMY1 subject strong pressures natural selection, particularly given potential inﬂuence transcriptional translational levels (for example, see ref. 29). The characterization copy number variation among humans humans primates promises considerable insight evolutionary history. METHODS Samples.

The hepatocarcinogenic activity choline- rized deficient diets first reported 1946 [5]. These early observations extended species organs eventually called ques- tion discovery aflatoxin contamination peanut meal diets used achieve low methyl content diet [16]. From 1955 1983, major studies appeared literature describing complete carcinogenic activity choline-deficient diets. Yet, studies continued provide indications hepatocarcinogenesis frequently associated enhanced methyl insufficiency (Table I). Also, administra- tion rats methionine antimetabolite ethionine [17], low- lipotrope diet Newberne [ 181, amino-acid-defined, methyl- deficient diet Poirier (191, provided evidence hepatic methyl insufficiency either low levels S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) macromolecular hypomethylat ion [ 201.

These diets later- shown contaminated liver carcinogen aflatoxin. The methionine antagonist ethionine caused liver cancer rats. Chronic administration liver carcinogens methyl- deficient diets rats led similar biochemical changes liver, including de- creased hepatic SAM. A low-lipotrope (methyl- deficient) diet enhanced activities several hepato- carcinogens rats. A choline-devoid diet exerted cocarcinogenic tumor-promoting activities toward livers rats. Feeding carcinogenic regime 2-acetylaminofluorene rats led DNA hypomethy- lation liver. 111. HEPATOCARCINOGENESIS AND BIOCHEMICAL CHANGES Beginning 1983, three publications clearly showed carcinogen- free methyl-deficient diets caused liver cancer rats [21-231. In first study, Mikol et al. [21], using amino acid-defined diet, showed POI R I ER diet lacking methionine choline produced liver cancer en- hanced liver tumor formation rats given single initiating dose dieth- ylnitrosame. Ghoshal Farber [22] Yokoyama et al. [23], using alcohol-extracted, peanut-meal-containing diets, obtained similar tumor yields livers male rats. Thus, hepatocarcinogenicity choline methyl deprivation seemed clearly established. In fact, biochemical changes commonly associated liver tumor formation chemical carcinogens also seen hepatocarcinogenesis methyl deprivation. These included: accumulation lipid peroxides [24, 251, increased levels ornithine SAM decarboxylases [ 191, increased thy- midine incorporation liver DNA [26], decreased levels histidase urocanase (271, finally, increased formation altered hepatic foci [28, 291. The latter findings particularly interesting potentially mechanistic standpoint. In absence diethylnitrosamine initiation, chronic feeding amino-acid-defined diet, lacking methionine choline, led formation altered hepatic foci continuously increased volume number; observation consistent hypothesis methyl deprivation continuously initiating stress, rather highly effective promoter preexisting, initiated he- patocytes [28]. The strong liver-tumor-promoting activity choline defi- ciency previously described [ 301. While effects dietary methyl deficiency hepatocarcinogenesis explored, investigations conducted interac- tions hepatocarcinogens liver tumor promoters labile me- thyl groups. In particular, effects interactions liver tumor formation, hepatic levels SAM, DNA content 5- methyldeoxycytidine (5-MC) determined. The results summarized Table 2 [8, 9, 12, 15, 18. 21, 31-39]. The hepatocarcinogenic activities three four carcinogens examined-ethionine, diethylnitrosamine, 2-acetylaminofluorene-were shown enhanced dietary lipo- trope deficiency inhibited high dietary levels methionine and/ choline (Table 2).

ALTERATIONS IN ONCOGENES DURING HEPATOCARCINOGENESIS BY METHYL DEPRIVATION The early association decreased hepatic SAM DNA hypom- ethylation led proposal increased oncogene expression caused hypomethylat ion causative factor hepatocarcinogenesis methyl deficiency. This hypothesis supported number related observations. Specific gene hypomethylation commonly associated increased expression [41]. Two DNA hypomethylating agents, an- timetabolites ethionine 5-azacytidine, altered differentiation Friend erythroleukemia cells vitro [42]. 5-Azacytidine transformed cells vitro [43] enhanced liver tumor formation vivo [44, 451. SAM-dependent DNA methylation inhibited transforming activity Moloney sarcoma virus virro [46]. Generalized DNA hypomethylation I90 POIRIER commonly seen tumors transformed cells compared tissues cells origin [47]. Finally, H-rus oncogene colon carcinomas hypomethylated compared adjacent normal tissue 1481. Our studies showed 18-month feeding several methyl-deficient amino-acid-defined diets led hypomethylation c-H-rus c-K-rus oncogenes neoplastic preneoplastic liver 149). More recent re- sults showed 1- 32-week feeding carcinogenic methyl-deficient amino-acid-defined diet resulted hypomethylation CCGG se- quences c-H-rus, c-K-rus, clfos protooncogenes times investigated [50]. In fact, methylation changes c-H-rus gene increased intensity throughout experimental period 32 weeks resembled seen livers rats fed diet 18 months. Slot-blot analyses livers showed increased expres- sion three protoncogenes correlating decreased methyla- tion [5 I]. These results demonstrate early selective hypomethylation CCGG sites, accompanied increased gene expression, rats undergoing hepatocarcinogenesis dietary methyl deprivation. All oncogene changes described independent carcinogen administrat ion. Several laboratories investigated correlations DNA methylation oncogene expression hepatocarcinogenesis. Wainfan, Christman, collaborators [52, 531 showed chronic administration rats amino-acid-defined, methyl-deficient diet 1-4 weeks led following: ( I ) DNA hypomethylation mea- sured SAM-dependent, methyl acceptor activity; (2) increased DNA me- thylase activity; (3) increased expression decreased methylation protooncogenes c-myc, c-fos, c-Hi-rus; (4) change expres- sion methylation c-K-ras oncogene. All changes observed group could reversed placing animals corresponding methyl-adequate diet 1-2 weeks [52, 531. The group Locker Lombardi examined hepatocarcinogenenic effects choline- devoid diet amplification methylation c-myc protoncogene 1541. They found that: (1) c-myc amplified 2- 70-fold tumors produced diet; (2) relative c-myc transcript levels increased stages neoplasia; (3) hypomethylation c-myc observed livers rats fed choline-devoid diet 12 months; (4) c-myc gene tumors showed varying degrees hypermethylation specific site hypomethylation. In related studies, Feo collaborators [55] investigated SAMEAH ratios well oncogene methylation expression persistent nodules produced livers rats treated modified Soh-Farber regime [56]. They found following changes persistent nodules: (1) decreased SAM/SAH ratios 40% controls; METHYL INSUFFICIENCY IN CARCINOGENESIS 191 TABLE 3 Effects SAM Incidence Hepatocellular Carcinomas Rats Subjected InitiatiodSelectiodPromotion Regime" Time sacrifice (months) 6 14 24-28 "Derived Ref. 58.

Chronic treatment animals SAM led partial, marked, reversal molecular changes noted 1571. In extension studies, group showed chronic administration SAM markedly inhibited tumor-promoting activity phenobarbital rats previously treated Soh-Farber regimen (Table 3) [58]. While changes described essentially describe correlations be- tween oncogene hypomethylation activation, results recently showed high frequency mutations p53 gene DNA tumors caused choline deprivation [59]. In preliminary studies, DNA tumors derived livers rats fed amino-acid-defined, methyl- deficient diets transformed NIH-3T3 cells [49]. However, study, 4 28 tumor DNA samples examined exhibited transfecting activity; showed amplified H-ras transfectants. However, positive DNA samples came diethylnitrosamine-initiated rats; none DNA samples uninitiated rats fed severely methyl-deficient diets transformed NIH-3T3 cells [49]. In recent studies, DNA sam- ples liver tumors developing rats fed methionine- choline- deficient diet, well cells obtained tumors, transformed NIH-3T3 cells; cells displayed c-myc amplification [60]. In summary, molecular biological studies conducted date hepa- tocarcinogenesis dietary methyl deprivation indicate hypome- thylation increased expression c-H-rus, c-K-rus, c-fos observed, role carcinogenesis, absence initiat- ing agent, remains established. On hand, presence activated myc mutated p53 genes tumors animals fed 192 POIRIER methyl-deficient diets without carcinogen treatment suggests changes likely play causative role carcinogenesis system.

Consistent hypothesis oxidative damage DNA results mutations leading cancer observations chronic admin- istration choline-deficient diets leads to: ( I ) single-strand breaks 1611; (2) high hepatic levels peroxidized lipids [61, 661; (3) inhibition al- tered hepatic foci induced choline deprivation feeding antiox- idants [67]; (4) formation 8-hydroxyguanine hepatic DNA [62, 681.

For example, number observations linked abnormal differentiation pancreatic acinar cells inadequate supply methyl donors.

Genes involved as- pects normal cell function, regulating cell cycle, differentiation, adhesion, death, silenced lung tumors (3).

This hypothesis validated two studies, first detecting methylation p16 MGMT genes sputum 3 years clinical diagnosis squamous cell carcinoma (9).

These studies suggested gene promoter hypermethylation spu- tum could used molecular marker identifying people high risk cancer incidence (11). However, precise mechanism carcinogens disrupt capacity cells maintain epigenetic code DNA replication re- pair largely unknown. The fact gene promoter methylation promising marker lung cancer makes understanding factors in- fluence propensity epigenetic process throughout respiratory epithelium high priority knowledge could used early detection also identify persons would benefit chemopre- vention. The precise mechanism carcinogens dis- rupt capacity cells maintain epigenetic code DNA replication repair largely unknown. Carci- nogens within tobacco induce single- double-strand breaks DNA, reduced DNA repair capacity (DRC) associated lung cancer (12). Accumulating ev- idence group suggests extensive DNA damage could responsible acquisition gene promoter hyper- methylation lung carcinogenesis (3, 13). Strong sup- port supposition provided recent community-based study highly significant associ- ation seen DRC sequence variants within specific DNA repair genes propensity methylation genes detected sputum cancer-free smokers Lovelace Smokers Cohort (14). Specifically, smokers high methylation index (defined three genes methylated eight-gene panel sputum) 50% reduction DRC compared smokers genes methylated sputum. Single nucleotide polymorph- isms within five double-strand break DNA repair genes also highly associated methylation index. This study suggests chronic DNA damage coupled reduced DRC could important determinant inducing gene promoter hypermethylation. Epidemiologic studies suggest select dietary nutrients vitamin supplements might protect lung cancer (15). Fruits, vegetables, multivitamins possess antiox- idant activity reduce tobacco-induced DNA damage. In addition, folate, B vitamin, metabolized 5-methyltetrahydrofolate provides methyl groups S- adenosylmethionine (SAM), universal donor reactions include methylation DNA (16). Low folate as- sociated reduced DRC increase prevalence gene promoter methylation (17, 18). The purpose cur- rent investigation determine whether diet multi- vitamin use influence presence methylation cells exfoliated aerodigestive tract current former smokers. Composite variables selected based hy- potheses fruits, tomatoes, cruciferous vegetables, leafy vegetables, yellow vegetables, vitamin intake asso- ciated reduction number genes methylated sputum, whereas animal fat red processed meat associated increased methylation.

Association dietary factors gene methylation. Each dietary factor assessed association methylation status (two genes methylated versus fewer two genes) using logistic regression. A total 21 variables examined: three macronutrients, nine mi- cronutrients, six serving variables, three categorical variables (consumption alcohol, vitamins, cod liver oil; Table 4; Supplementary Table S1). Leafy green vegetable consumption significantly associated reduced risk high methylation status [odds ratio (OR), 0.83; 95% CI, 0.74–0.93], higher folate (OR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.72–0.99; Table 4). The striking effect seen association current multivitamin use methylation status (OR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.40–0.83; Table 4). The duration vitamin use associated methylation (data shown). Moreover, folate levels higher participants taking multivitamins, stratification vita- min use also conducted folate remained signifi- cantly associated methylation.

In addition, vitamin E showed protective effect methylation per gene (OR, 0.98 per 20 mg/d; 95% CI, 0.96–1.00; P = 0.04). Discussion This first cohort-based study systematically eval- uate association dietary factors risk methylation cells exfoliated aerodigestive tract smokers former smokers. Our findings support sig- nificant, biologically plausible role leafy green vegetables, folate, multivitamin use protection acqui- sition gene promoter methylation. There considerable interest debate dec- ades effect diet vitamins risk can- cer. Recent large epidemiologic studies along functional investigations beginning provide clearer picture dietary variables may influence risk cancers lung clear causative environmental exposure form smoking established. Reduced folate in- take associated increased risk lung cancer current former smokers (22). A link folate gene methylation exists role 5-methyltetrahy- drofolate providing methyl groups SAM, key methyl donor methylation DNA. Higher folate as- sociated lower prevalence methylation individ- ual total number genes colorectal tumors (17). This finding validated second study colorectal tumors folate inversely associated gene-specific promoter hypermethylation (23). Our study shows first time acquisition gene promoter methylation throughout airway epithelium influenced folate. The biological mechanisms related low folate hypermethy- lation still unclear; however, Jhaveri colleagues (24) suggested folate deficiency leads increased levels SAM S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), inhibitor SAM. The increase free intracellular SAM could contribute gene-specific hypermethylation absolute level SAH needed regulate SAM maintained. Folate also in- volved DNA repair de novo synthesis purines pyrimidines, low dietary folate associated reduced DRC (18). This observation, combined recent study identifying reduced DRC determinant gene promoter methylation sputum (14), suggests folate may directly, affecting one-carbon pool, indirectly, affecting DRC, affect propensity methylation. Green leafy vegetables food item anal- ysis exhibit protection methylation status. Leafy vegetables rich phytochemicals vitamin C, carotenoids, lutein, folic acid addition vitamins A K. A comprehensive systematic review litera- Dietary Factors Protect Gene Methylation Smokers ture 2007 World Cancer Research Fund (WCRF) concluded probable evidence existed reduction lung cancer risk among persons higher intake fruits, whereas evidence inconclusive green leafy vegeta- bles (15). However, recent hospital-based case-control study lung cancer (25) showed strong protective effect green leafy vegetables (OR, 0.5; 95% CI, 0.3–0.81). The lack effect cruciferous vegetable methylation status study surprising lung cancer observational studies report modest effects may influenced genetic variation (26). In addition, lack association red meat processed meat intake consistent inconclusive evidence, summarized WCRF (15). However, recent cohort study observed increased risk lung cancer among consuming meats prepared ways would expected increased carcino- genicity (27). In study, strong protection gene methylation also associated use multivitamins contain agents leafy green vegetables. Although clear connection vitamin supplements risk lung cancer established (28), vitamin supple- mentation associated reduction DNA dam- age benzo(a)pyrene, major tobacco carcinogen (29–32). The silencing genes promoter hypermethylation well established major component lung cancer initiation progression emerged potential disease marker early detection.
