In the last 10 years nutritional research on diabetes has improved dramatically in terms of both number of studies produced and quality of
methodologies employed. Therefore, it is now possible to attempt to provide the evidence on which nutritional recommendations for the
prevention of type 2 diabetes could be based. We therefore performed a literature search and, among the papers published in indexed jour-
nals, we selected relevant epidemiological (mostly prospective) and controlled intervention studies. Lifestyle factors that have, so far, been
consistently associated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes are overweight and physical inactivity. However, recent evidence from epi-
demiological studies has shown that the risk of type 2 diabetes is also associated with diet composition, particularly with: (1) low ﬁbre
intake; (2) a high trans fatty acid intake and a low unsaturated:saturated fat intake ratio; (3) absence of or excess alcohol consumption. All
these factors are extremely common in Western populations and therefore the potential impact of any intervention on them is large: indeed,
. 90 % of the general population has one or more of these risk factors. The ability to correct these behaviours in the population is esti-
mated to reduce the incidence of diabetes by as much as 87 %. Recent intervention studies have shown that type 2 diabetes can be pre-
vented by lifestyle changes aimed at body-weight reduction, increased physical activity and multiple changes in the composition of the
diet. Within this context, the average amount of weight loss needed is not large, about 5 % initial weight, which is much less than the
weight loss traditionally considered to be clinically signiﬁcant for prevention of type 2 diabetes. In conclusion, new emphasis on preven-
tion by multiple lifestyle modiﬁcations, including moderate changes in the composition of the habitual diet, might limit the dramatic
increase in incidence of type 2 diabetes envisaged worldwide.

Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder of multiple aetiol-
ogy characterised by chronic hyperglycaemia and associ-
ated with
protein
metabolism. These abnormalities are the consequences of
either inadequate insulin secretion or impaired insulin
action, or both. Diabetes has been recently reclassiﬁed
into four distinct types: type 1; type 2; gestational diabetes
mellitus; other speciﬁc types (American Diabetes Associ-
ation, 1997; World Health Organization, 1999).

and

Type 2 diabetes mellitus, until recently referred to as non-
insulin-dependent diabetes, accounts for about 85 – 95 % of
all disease cases. In Western countries the estimated preva-
lence in the population is 4 – 6 %: half of these cases are
diagnosed, while a similar number remains unrecognised.
The disease is observed much more frequently in older
people and in some ethnic communities (up to 40 % of
Pima Indians). WHO has predicted that the global preva-
lence of type 2 diabetes will more than double from 1995

to 2025, from 135 million to 300 million (King et al.
1998; Choi & Shi, 2001).

Long-term complications of type 2 diabetes include reti-
nopathy (with potential loss of vision) nephropathy (leading
to renal failure), peripheral neuropathy (with risk of foot
ulcers and gangrene), and autonomic neuropathy (which
contributes to erectile dysfunction and cardiac arrhythmia).
However, most of the morbidity and mortality associated
with diabetes is attributable to macrovascular compli-
cations, such as myocardial infarction and acute stroke.
Diabetes is associated with an age-adjusted cardiovascular
mortality between 2- and 4-times that of the non-diabetic
population, while life expectancy is reduced by 5 – 10
years in middle-aged patients with type 2 diabetes (Stamler
et al. 1993; Uusitupa et al. 1993; United Kingdom Prospec-
tive Diabetes Study, 1998; Roselli della Rovere et al. 2003).
Patients with type 2 diabetes are treated with diet, oral
agents or insulin in order to keep their blood glucose

levels as close as possible to normal; treatment is aimed at
relieving symptoms and at reducing the risk of long-term
complications, which increase linearly with the degree of
derangement of the metabolic control. However, although
the treatment of diabetes has become highly sophisticated,
optimal blood glucose control is not reached in most cases;
moreover, microvascular and macrovascular diseases are
already present in many individuals with undiagnosed or
newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes. Therefore, prevention
of diabetes has been authoritatively proposed as a promis-
ing approach to drastically reduce the huge burden result-
ing from the
(American
Diabetes Association and National Institute of Diabetes,
Digestive and Kidney Diseases, 2002).

complications of diabetes

The importance of lifestyle modiﬁcations for the preven-
tion of type 2 diabetes has long been recognised. Several
observational studies suggest that diabetes is primarily a
lifestyle disorder; the highest prevalence rates occur in
developing countries and in populations undergoing ‘wes-
ternisation’ or modernisation. Under such circumstances,
genetic susceptibility seems to interact with environmental
changes, such as sedentary life and overnutrition, leading
to type 2 diabetes. Populations such as Nauru or Pima
Indians, who have the highest reported prevalence of dia-
betes, share the common experience of environmental
changes since they abandoned their traditional hunter –
gatherer or agricultural-based lifestyle for
sedentary
living and a diet of energy-dense processed foods (West,
1978; O’Dea, 1992).

However, until very recently, the evidence available to
support lifestyle modiﬁcations to prevent type 2 diabetes
has been weak and often inconsistent, and therefore any
advice to high-risk individuals or to the general population
has so far been largely based on personal views or, at the
very best, on a consensus of experts. In the last 10 years
nutritional research on diabetes has improved dramatically
in terms of both number of studies produced and quality
of methodologies employed. Therefore, it is now possible
to attempt to provide the evidence on which nutritional
recommendations for the prevention of type 2 diabetes
could be based.

Weight and low physical-activity levels represent the
most important risk factors for type 2 diabetes; therefore,
any strategy for diabetes prevention should consider lifestyle
modiﬁcation aimed at weight reduction and regular physical
exercise (American Diabetes Association and National Insti-
tute of Diabetes, Digestive and Kidney Diseases, 2002).
However, in this regard, sustained behavioural changes are
hard to achieve; in addition, the general trend in the last
few years has been towards an increased prevalence of over-
weight and a progressive decline in physical activity levels,
especially among children and adolescents (Deckelbaum &
Williams, 2001). Conversely, evidence is accumulating that
diet composition, besides energy intake, also inﬂuences the
risk of type 2 diabetes; therefore, it may be wise to attempt a
multifactorial approach to diabetes prevention by introdu-
cing multiple small changes to adjust unhealthy lifestyles.
This approach might facilitate compliance and maximise
the metabolic effects.

Against this background, we reviewed the literature on
diet and type 2 diabetes risk to take advantage of all the

relevant information available, trying not only to collect
data, but also, whenever possible,
to compare studies
based on different methodologies and thus provide the
reader with all the information necessary to evaluate the
consistency and strength of the associations between each
speciﬁc dietary factor and the prevention of type 2 diabetes.
Moreover, whenever possible, we have also tried to gather
information on the possible effects of diet on the pathophy-
siological mechanisms of type 2 diabetes, as this would
facilitate the evaluation of a cause – effect relationship
between a speciﬁc diet component and type 2 diabetes.

Methods

We performed a literature search (MEDLINE) in Septem-
ber 2003 on dietary factors (fat, protein, carbohydrate, gly-
caemic index (GI) and glycaemic load (GL), sugars, ﬁbre,
alcohol, dietary patterns) and type 2 diabetes risk. The
search produced 310 original papers,
from which we
selected all the epidemiological (mostly prospective) and
controlled intervention studies relevant
to the topic of
this review (n 63).

Relationship between diet, insulin sensitivity and the
development of type 2 diabetes

Energy

Overweight is by far the most important risk factor for type
2 diabetes. Almost 70 – 80 % of type 2 diabetic patients are
either overweight or obese; moreover, several long-term
prospective studies have shown a higher risk of diabetes
with increasing body weight (Bennet et al. 1971; Knowler
et al. 1981; Larsson et al. 1981; Van Itallie, 1985; Ohlson
et al. 1988; Lundegren et al. 1989; Curb & Marcus, 1991;
Perry et al. 1995; Maggio & Xavier, 1997).

In most studies the relationship between body weight
and the risk of diabetes is continuous and graded (Colditz
et al. 1990). The degree of overweight and the distribution
of fat are important in the development of diabetes. An
upper body or central distribution of body fat, indepen-
dently of the absolute level of obesity, increases the risk
of diabetes (Lapidus et al. 1984; Ohlson et al. 1985; Bjo`rn-
torp, 1992; Chan et al. 1994; Boyko et al. 2000; Samaras &
Campbell, 2000). Abdominal fat can be evaluated by
anthropometric measurements, such as waist circumfer-
ence, waist:hip cirumference ratio, sagittal abdominal
diameter or by instrumental techniques such as compu-
terised tomography or nuclear magnetic resonance imaging
(speciﬁcally to measure visceral fat). Patients with central
adiposity (waist circumference . 1·02 m in male and
. 0·88 m in female patients) have higher insulin levels
and are more insulin resistant than subjects with a similar
weight but a peripheral-type of obesity (Abate et al.
1997; Samaras & Campbell, 2000; Laaksonen et al.
2003). Abdominal adipose tissue not only has a greater
metabolic activity but also is anatomically positioned
closer to the liver,
implying a greater ﬂux of NEFA
going to the liver. This, in turn, can interfere with glucose
oxidation and hepatic extraction of
insulin. There is
evidence indicating that elevated plasma NEFA levels

could also impair insulin secretion at the level of the pan-
creatic b-cells (Boden, 1996; Wiesenthal et al. 1999;
Frayn, 2000).

Observational data from the Framingham Study on 618
overweight subjects showed the effects of weight loss on
risk of diabetes. Sustained weight
loss led to a 37 %
lower risk of diabetes (relative risk 0·63 (95 % CI 0·34,
1·20)) and this effect was stronger for more obese people
(BMI . 29; relative risk 0·38 (95 % CI, 0·18, 0·81)). In
particular, those who lost 3·7 – 4·5 kg had a 33 % reduction
in diabetes risk, whereas those losing more weight had a
51 % reduction in risk (Moore et al. 2000).

The importance of overweight in relation to the risk of
type 2 diabetes has been conﬁrmed by intervention studies
showing that a reduction of body weight decreases the inci-
dence of diabetes (Toumı`lehto et al. 2001; Diabetes Pre-
vention Program Research Group, 2002). In addition, in
those already affected by the disease, weight loss reduces
fasting hyperglycaemia as a consequence of the reduced
postabsorptive rates of hepatic glucose production. Further-
more, weight loss improves insulin sensitivity in peripheral
tissues and, in particular, increases the capacity of non-oxi-
dative glucose metabolism (Henry et al. 1986a,b; Albu
et al. 1997).

Diet composition can inﬂuence the development of type
2 diabetes by affecting body weight. However, the evidence
available in the literature is incomplete and in particular
lacks information from properly designed randomised
intervention trials. Laboratory experiments in animals and
clinical studies in human subjects have repeatedly shown
that dietary factors, particularly fat and energy intakes,
are strongly and positively associated with excess body
weight. By contrast, the population-based studies on diet
and obesity have yielded inconsistent results due to a
number of factors, including weakness in the study design
and systematic measurement errors
in dietary data
(Riccardi et al. 2004).

Excessive body-fat deposition is a consequence of an
imbalance between energy intake and energy expenditure;
therefore, since the majority of the population have sedentary
lifestyles, it is energy intake that really matters in relation to
the development of overweight, and energy intake is often
high when fat-rich foods are consumed in large amounts
(Astrup, 2001); nevertheless, in some cases, particularly
in children and adolescents, excessive consumption of
carbohydrate-rich foods (soft drinks) may be predictive of
overweight (Ludwig et al. 2001). There is also evidence
that consumption of a low-energy (high ﬁbre) diet reduces
energy intake, thus facilitating weight reduction (Yao &
Roberts, 2001). However, there are no long-term clinical
trials examining the effects of diet composition on
body-weight regulation.

Carbohydrates and ﬁbre

Carbohydrate is traditionally classiﬁed as sugars, oligosac-
charides and polysaccharides on the basis of its chemical
structure (Bantle, 1989; Asp, 1994; Food and Agriculture
Organization/World Health Organization, 1998). However,
a classiﬁcation based purely on their chemistry does not
provide a ready guide to their importance for health.

the most

More important is classiﬁcation based on their ability to
be digested and absorbed in the human small intestine,
thus contributing directly or indirectly to the body’s carbo-
hydrate pool (glycaemic carbohydrates); in this classiﬁ-
cation carbohydrates that are not digested and absorbed
in the human small intestine are kept separate from glycae-
mic carbohydrates, and among them dietary ﬁbre rep-
resents
important group (Trowell, 1976;
Cummings & Englyst, 1987, 1991; Parillo & Riccardi,
1995; Vinik & Jenkins, 1998). Carbohydrate-rich foods
can also be classiﬁed on the basis of their effects on post-
prandial glycaemia, which can be expressed as GI. This
index is based on the increase in blood glucose concen-
tration (the incremental area under the curve of blood glu-
cose concentration) after the ingestion of a portion of a test
food containing 50 g carbohydrate, divided by the incre-
mental blood glucose area achieved with the same
amount (50 g) of carbohydrate present in an equivalent por-
tion of reference food (glucose or white bread). Fibre-rich
foods often have a low GI, although some foods with a
low-ﬁbre content may also have a low GI (Jenkins et al.
1982, 1984; Parillo et al. 1985; Hollenbeck et al. 1986;
Riccardi & Rivellese, 1987; Bjorck et al. 2000).

Several beneﬁcial effects of high-ﬁbre low-GI diets have
been shown,
including lower postprandial glucose and
insulin responses, improved lipid control and, possibly,
improved insulin sensitivity (Parillo et al. 1988; Fugawa
et al. 1990; Riccardi & Rivellese, 1991; Frost et al.
1998; Wolk et al. 1999; Chandalia et al. 2000; Wolever,
2000; Ford & Liu, 2001). There is no exact value of a
high- or low-GI diet. However, it seems clear that: (1)
the lower the GI the better the metabolic effects; (2) the
differences between a low- (, 70) and a high- (. 80) GI
diet should be at least 10 % in order to achieve measurable
metabolic effects (Willett et al. 2002).

In epidemiological studies the intake of either total
carbohydrate or sugars (sucrose) does not predict the risk
of diabetes (Yang et al. 2003). In particular, in most studies
in which the relationship between intake of reﬁned sugars
and incidence of type 2 diabetes has been examined, the
results show no positive association between sucrose con-
sumption and risk of diabetes (Howard & Wylie-Rosett,
2002; Willett et al. 2002; Janket et al. 2003). Conversely,
there is strong evidence that a diet rich in carbohydrate and
ﬁbre and with low GI may contribute to the prevention of
diabetes prevention (Table 1). Some prospective studies
have shown an inverse relationship between the consump-
tion of ﬁbre-rich foods and the risk of type 2 diabetes. In
two of them a slight decrease in diabetes risk was also
found with a low-GI diet compared with a high-GI diet
(Salmero`n, 1997a,b). These results, however, have not
been conﬁrmed in all studies (Feskens & Kromhout,
1989; Lundgren et al. 1989; Feskens et al. 1995; Williams
et al. 1999; van Dam et al. 2000; Hu & van Dam, 2001;
Meyer et al. 2001; Stevens et al. 2002; Willett et al.
2002; Mantonen et al. 2003).

Since postprandial blood glucose response is inﬂuenced
not only by the GI value of the food, but also by the
amount of ingested carbohydrate, the concept of GL (the
GI of a speciﬁc food multiplied by the amount of carbo-
hydrate contained in an average portion of
the food

consumed) has been developed in epidemiological studies
to represent better the quantity and quality of carbo-
hydrates consumed. Each unit of dietary GL represents
the equivalent glycaemic effect of 1 g carbohydrate from
white bread, which is used as the reference food (Willett
et al. 2002). The Nurses’ Health Study on 65 173 female
subjects followed for 6 years, in which 915 new cases of
diabetes developed, reports an increase in the incidence
of diabetes in those consuming a diet with a higher GL,
especially if in combination with a low intake of cereal
ﬁbre. In this study the relative risk of type 2 diabetes
was 2·50 (95 % CI 1·14, 5·51) for women with the combi-
nation of high GL and low-ﬁbre intake (GL. 165 and
cereal ﬁbre , 2·5 g/d v. GL, 143 and cereal ﬁbre
. 5·8 g/d) (Salmero`n et al. 1997; Liu et al. 2000). In
addition, the GI of the diet was also positively associated
with the risk of diabetes, with a continuous relationship

-GI diet (P, 0·04). These results have been conﬁrmed in
men in the Health Professionals’ follow-up study (Sal-
mero`n et al. 1997; Fung et al. 2002), but not in a recent
analysis of the Iowa Women’s Health Study, where a
cohort of 35 988 older women from Iowa (USA) were fol-
lowed for 6 years (1141 incident cases of diabetes were
reported; Meyer et al. 2000). Despite the lack of associ-
ation between GL and risk of diabetes, dietary ﬁbre
intake was also associated with a lower risk of diabetes.
Indeed, the relative risk of diabetes in women in the high-
est quintile of consumption of wholegrain products
(median value 20·5 servings per week) v. the lowest quin-
tile (median value 1·0 serving per week) was 0·79 (95 % CI
0·65, 0·96; P for trend¼ 0·009). Noteworthy is that in most
prospective studies cereal ﬁbre intake,
is
inversely associated with diabetes incidence (McKeown
et al. 2002; Stevens et al. 2002; Montonen et al. 2003);
however, fruit and vegetable consumption is also associ-
ated with a reduced risk of type 2 diabetes (Williams
et al. 1999; Ford & Mokdad, 2001; Sargeant et al. 2001).
Most of the epidemiological studies prospectively evaluat-
ing the relationship between dietary ﬁbre intake and risk of

in particular,

type 2 diabetes are consistent in showing a protective effect
of ﬁbre consumption towards the development of diabetes.
There have not been any intervention studies evaluating
the effect of ﬁbre and/or GI on prevention of diabetes,
although the most important intervention studies aiming
at lifestyle modiﬁcation also included an increase in ﬁbre
consumption in the intervention group (Tuomı`lehto et al.
2001; Diabetes Prevention Program Research Group,
2002). In support of the role of ﬁbre in the prevention of
type 2 diabetes is evidence that reduced postprandial
blood glucose levels contribute to reducing the risk of
diabetes. Indeed all pharmacological and non-pharmaco-
logical interventions able to reduce postprandial glycae-
mia, with whatever mechanism, tested so far in people
with pre-diabetes, have proven effective in the prevention
of type 2 diabetes (Tuomı`lehto et al. 2001; Chiasson
et al. 2002; Diabetes Prevention Program Research
Group, 2002; Hanefeld, 2002; Hanefeld & Temelkova-
Kurkschiev, 2002).

Amount and type of dietary fat

Dietary fatty acids are classiﬁed as saturated, monounsatu-
rated and polyunsaturated (n-6 and n-3 fatty acids) on the
basis of their chemical structure (Feskens & van Dam,
1999; Marshall & Bessensen, 2002).

Early epidemiological studies reported that

total fat
intake was positively associated with the risk of diabetes
(West & Kalbﬂeish, 1971). This effect was partly mediated
by the inﬂuence of fat intake on weight gain, since fat-rich
foods are generally energy-dense (irrespective of the type
of fat). The type of fat predominantly used in these studies
was also associated with the risk of diabetes (greater with
animal fat than with vegetable fat). This has been sub-
sequently conﬁrmed by Kawate et al. (1979), who com-
pared Japanese people living in Hawaii with those living
in Japan and found that the former consumed twice as
much animal fat and had a signiﬁcantly higher prevalence
of diabetes than the latter. Other studies, however, did not
observe important associations between total fat intake and

incidence of type 2 diabetes, particularly when the inﬂu-
ence of body weight was accounted for by appropriate stat-
istical methodologies (Lundgren et al. 1989; Feskens et al.
1995). Table 2 shows the results of more recent prospective
studies taking into account the total fat intake and the type
of fat consumed. In the San Luis Valley Diabetes Study,
134 subjects with impaired glucose tolerance were fol-
lowed for 3 years: fat consumption in those who developed
diabetes was 43·4 % total energy intake compared with
40·6 % in those who still had impaired glucose tolerance
(n 43) and 38·9 % in those who reverted to normal glucose
tolerance (n 60). An increase in fat intake (40 g/d) was
associated with a 6 % greater risk of developing diabetes
(95 % CI 1·2, 29·8) (Marshall et al. 1991, 1994, 1997);
saturated fat was also marginally associated with an
increased risk of diabetes (P¼ 0·06). In the Finnish and
the Dutch cohorts of the Seven Countries Study total fat
consumption and saturated fat intake contributed to the
risk of type 2 diabetes (Feskens et al. 1995). In the
Nurses’ Health Study 84 204 women were followed pro-
spectively for 14 years (Salmero`n et al. 2001). The main
ﬁndings of this study, in which there were 2507 incident
cases of type 2 diabetes, were: (1) no association between
total fat, monounsaturated fat or saturated fat intake and
incidence of diabetes; (2) a positive association between
a higher trans fatty acid intake and risk of diabetes; (3) a
negative association between a 5 % higher energy intake
from polyunsaturated fat and incidence of diabetes
(2 35 %); (4) a positive association between intake of
animal fat and incidence of diabetes (this relationship
was no longer statistically signiﬁcant after correcting for
vegetable fat consumption). These data were subsequently
conﬁrmed by Meyer’s study on 35 988 elderly women in
Iowa (USA; Meyer et al. 2001). After an 11-year follow-
up the authors reported 1890 incident cases of diabetes
and found that vegetable fat intake was inversely related
with incidence of diabetes; when comparing the highest
category of vegetable fat intake with the lowest, the rela-
tive risk was 0·78 (95 % CI 0·67, 0·91). This result is

mirrored by the ﬁnding of a positive association between
animal fat consumption and diabetes incidence.

In the Health Professionals’ Study, which included
42 504 male subjects followed for 12 years, total and satu-
rated fat intakes were associated with a higher risk of type
2 diabetes (relative risk 1·27 and 1·34 respectively), but
these associations disappeared after adjustments for BMI.
However, there was an increased risk for diabetes in men
who consumed processed meat at
least ﬁve times per
week compared with those who consumed processed
meats less than once per month (relative risk 1·46; 95 %
CI 1·14, 1·86) (van Dam et al. 2002b). The role of
animal (saturated) fat as a risk factor for type 2 diabetes,
as opposed to the protective role played by vegetable
(unsaturated) fat, has been recently conﬁrmed in a cross-
sectional study on a European population (Thanopoulou
et al. 2003) and is further supported by evidence from
studies where dietary fat composition was assessed by
objective markers of fat intake (Vessby et al. 1994; Laak-
sonen, 2002; Wang et al. 2003).

Few epidemiological studies have evaluated the effects
of long-chain n-3 fatty acids on the risk of diabetes
(Table 3). High concentrations of
these fatty acids,
mainly EPA and docosahexaenoic acid, are found in ﬁsh
oil (Feskens & van Dam, 1999). In a study of 175 elderly
subjects an inverse association was observed between ﬁsh
intake and incidence of impaired glucose tolerance or dia-
betes, with an odds ratio 0·47 (95 % CI 0·23, 0·93) for par-
ticipants consuming any type of ﬁsh (mean daily intake
24·2 g; Feskens et al. 1991). Consistent with this ﬁnding
is the inverse association between increased ﬁsh consump-
tion and incidence of type 2 diabetes observed in the
Nurses’ Health Study (Salmero`n et al. 2001), while in
the Iowa Women’s Study a higher n-3 intake was even
associated with an increased risk of
type 2 diabetes
(Meyer et al. 2001).

In short, available epidemiological data suggest a poten-
tially beneﬁcial effect of vegetable (unsaturated) fat and a
potentially adverse effect of animal (saturated) fat and

trans fatty acids on the risk of type 2 diabetes (Hu & van
Dam, 2001). Total fat intake does not seem to predict per
se the development of type 2 diabetes, although when con-
sumed in large amounts it may indirectly inﬂuence the
development of this condition by facilitating the occur-
rence of overweight (Mayer-Davis et al. 1997; Marshall
& Bessensen, 2002). There are, however, no controlled
intervention trials evaluating the effects of different types
of fat on the incidence of diabetes. One study evaluated
the effects of a reduced-fat diet for 5 years in 176 individ-
uals with impaired glucose tolerance. Glucose tolerance
improved in patients on the reduced-fat diet, with a
lower proportion of subjects developing type 2 diabetes
at 1 year (47 v. 67 %, P, 0·05), although the differences
between groups waned with time. However, since in the
intervention group there was also a signiﬁcant reduction
of body weight (almost 3 kg) in the ﬁrst 3 years, it is difﬁ-
cult to differentiate between the effect of fat intake per se
and that mediated by weight loss on the risk of developing
diabetes (Swinburn et al. 2001).

In summary,

the available evidence (derived almost
exclusively from observational studies) indicates that shift-
ing from a diet predominantly based on fat from animal
sources to a diet in which vegetable fat is more often
employed might be beneﬁcial in relation to the prevention
of type 2 diabetes. An exception to this paradigm may be
represented by ﬁsh consumption, since in some studies it
is associated with a lower risk of diabetes. Whether the
protective effect of ﬁsh is due to its n-3 fatty acid content
(Adler et al. 1994) or to other components, such as protein,
is matter of debate (Lavigne et al. 2001). In this respect, it
is worth mentioning that the intake of foods rich in n-3
fatty acids other than ﬁsh is associated with a lower risk
of type 2 diabetes (Jiang et al. 2002).

The mechanism by which dietary fat consumption could
inﬂuence the development of diabetes is strictly linked
with insulin sensitivity: dietary fat can inﬂuence insulin
sensitivity independently of any change in body weight.
Animal studies have clearly shown that a high-fat diet, par-
ticularly a diet high in saturated fat, decreases insulin sen-
sitivity (Storlien et al. 1991). Several cross-sectional
studies have examined dietary fat in relation to fasting
and post-load plasma insulin concentrations, which are
both markers of insulin resistance. The consistent ﬁnding
is a positive association between saturated fat intake and
hyperinsulinaemia, independently of body fat. These data
have been partially conﬁrmed in human studies using
more accurate techniques to evaluate insulin resistance
(Vessby, 2000). An association between dietary fat quality

and insulin sensitivity is also supported by the signiﬁcant
relationship between insulin sensitivity and the fatty acid
composition of body tissues, which is dependent on the
fatty acid composition of the diet (Vessby et al. 1994). A
problem with these studies, however, is that most fatty
acids are closely interrelated and, therefore, insulin resist-
ance or an increased risk of type 2 diabetes are character-
ised by a fatty acid ‘pattern’, rather than by the proportion
of one or a few fatty acids.

The mechanisms linking dietary fat quality to insulin
sensitivity are not completely understood; however, the
effects of dietary fatty acids on insulin sensitivity are
thought
through the
fatty acid composition of cell membranes (Vessby et al.
1994; Storlien et al. 1996; Vessby, 2000). A speciﬁc
fatty acid proﬁle in cell membranes could inﬂuence insulin
action through several potential mechanisms,
including
altered insulin receptor binding or afﬁnity, and by inﬂuen-
cing ion permeability and cell signalling. The results of
human studies consistently show that the fatty acid compo-
sition of body tissues (serum lipids, phospholipid in eryth-
rocyte membranes,
in adipose tissue,
phospholipid in skeletal muscle membranes) reﬂects, at
least in part, the fat composition of the habitual diet (Ric-
cardi et al. 2004). The fatty acid pattern mirrors the aver-
age composition of the diet during the preceding weeks
(serum lipids, erythrocytes), months (possibly skeletal
muscle) and even years (adipose tissue). The strength of
the relationships between the proportion of a speciﬁc
fatty acid in the diet and in body tissues varies greatly
between different fatty acids and for different
tissues
(Aro, 2003). Insulin resistance and insulin resistant states
are associated with a plasma fatty acid pattern character-
ised by an increased proportion of palmitic acid and a
low proportion of linoleic acid, with a distribution of
other fatty acids that indicates an increased activity of
D9- and D6-desaturase. These changes are probably related,
to a large extent, to the type of fat in the diet and are con-
sistent with a diet where animal (saturated) fat consump-

More information on the issue of dietary fat quality and
insulin sensitivity has emerged from the KANWU Study,
which is the ﬁrst intervention study on this topic, per-
formed using adequate methodologies and a sufﬁciently
large sample size (Vessby et al. 2001). This study involved
162 healthy individuals from ﬁve different countries,
randomly assigned to consume diets high in saturated fat
or monounsaturated fat without any change in other dietary

constituents; a randomly selected subsample within each
group was also given ﬁsh-oil supplement or placebo. Insu-
lin sensitivity (assessed by the frequent sampling intrave-
nous tolerance test (minimal model)) was signiﬁcantly
(2 10 %,
impaired on the diet high in saturated fat
P¼ 0·05) but remained unchanged on the diet high in
monounsaturated fat. The n-3 fatty acid supplement did
not inﬂuence insulin sensitivity in the whole study group,
nor in those assigned to the diets high in saturated or
monounsaturated fat.

The deteriorating effect of saturated fat on insulin sensi-
tivity was supported by a subsequent controlled interven-
tion study in which the comparison was performed
between saturated fat and polyunsaturated fat (Summers
et al. 2002); however, it was not conﬁrmed in another
study in which both the sample size and the study duration
were inadequate (Lovejoy et al. 2002).

The KANWU Study (Vessby et al. 2001) did not attempt
to modify total fat intake; however, if participants were stra-
tiﬁed according to their habitual intake of total fat (above
and below median value), the effect of fat quality on insulin
sensitivity was clearly different between high- and low-fat
groups. In the group consuming . 37 % energy as total fat
(median value of the study population),
the difference
between the effect of the high-saturated-fat and the high-
monounsaturated-fat diet on insulin sensitivity almost com-
pletely disappeared; conversely, in those consuming , 37 %
energy as total fat, the difference between the two diets was
even more striking (20·3 %, P, 0·03) (Fig. 1). This suggests
that the total amount of fat can inﬂuence insulin sensitivity,
and possibly the risk of type 2 diabetes, only when it
exceeds a threshold level of 35 – 40 % total energy intake.
This is in accordance with clinical studies showing that a
moderate increase in total fat intake within current limits
is unlikely to have a negative impact on insulin sensitivity
(Parillo et al. 1992). In this regard, n-3 fatty acid sup-
plementation does not seem to play a major role; this
suggests that the relationship between ﬁsh consumption
and risk of diabetes is complex, and that further studies
are needed to clarify the possible underlying mechanisms
and the existence of a dose – response relationship as well
as gene – nutrients interactions.

Alcohol

Several studies have evaluated the relationship between
alcohol intake and diabetes; they are consistent in showing
that moderate alcohol consumption (one to two drinks per

d) is associated with a 30 – 40 % lower risk of type 2 dia-
betes compared with abstainers (Table 4) (Stampfer et al.
1988; Perry et al. 1995; Ajani et al. 2000; Conigrave
et al. 2001; Carlsson et al. 2003; Nakanishi et al. 2003).
In addition, various epidemiological studies have suggested
that light to moderate alcohol consumption has beneﬁcial
effects on total mortality and morbidity (Stampfer et al.
1988; Keil et al. 1997; Muuntwyler et al. 1998; Conigrave
et al. 2001).

Some studies, while conﬁrming the beneﬁcial effects of
moderate alcohol consumption, highlight the possible dan-
gers of high alcohol intake also in relation to diabetes pre-
vention (Kao et al. 2001). In particular, they suggest a U-
shaped relationship between alcohol intake and incidence
of diabetes, with the risk being the lowest in light and mod-
erate drinkers and the highest in heavy drinkers (Wei et al.
2000; Harding et al. 2002; Wannamethee et al. 2002, 2003;
Nakanishi et al. 2003). Overall, these studies show that a
moderate alcohol intake may have a protective effect on
the risk of diabetes independently of the type of beverage.
The beneﬁcial effects of moderate intake of alcohol on dia-
betes incidence could be explained by the enhanced insulin
sensitivity found in moderate alcohol drinkers (Facchini
et al. 1994). However, beneﬁts from moderate alcohol con-
sumption on diabetes incidence could also be mediated by
dietary exposures and other aspects of lifestyle associated

information on the possible beneﬁcial effects of alcohol
consumption on the risk of type 2 diabetes.

Intervention studies based on a multifactorial design

There are very few controlled intervention studies on life-
style modiﬁcations and prevention of type 2 diabetes in the
literature. In the Da Qing study (Pan et al. 1997) 577
patients with impaired glucose tolerance were randomly
assigned to four groups (control, diet only, exercise only
or diet plus exercise) and followed for 6 years. The inci-
dence of diabetes decreased by 31 % in the diet group,
by 46 % in the exercise group and by 42 % in diet plus
exercise group, with no signiﬁcant differences between
the three. This beneﬁcial effect was obtained with a mini-
mal weight loss (about 0·5 kg) and increase in physical
activity. This study is the ﬁrst randomised controlled clini-
cal trial showing that it is possible to reduce the risk of type
2 diabetes in individuals with impaired glucose tolerance
by a lifestyle intervention; however, due to some methodo-
logical ﬂaws, it was not received by the scientiﬁc commu-
nity as conclusive evidence.

More recently, two studies have conﬁrmed the import-
ance of lifestyle modiﬁcations induced by a multifactorial
intervention in the prevention of
type 2 diabetes
(Table 5): the Finnish Diabetes Prevention study and the
Diabetes Prevention Program. These two studies had an
appropriate study design and an up-to-date methodological
approach, and their results therefore provide evidence that
lifestyle modiﬁcation represents a very effective and
powerful way to decrease or delay the development of
type 2 diabetes in overweight individuals at high risk.

In the Finnish study of Tuomı`lehto et al. (2001), 522
overweight subjects with impaired glucose tolerance were
randomly assigned to an active intervention group or a
standard treatment group (general advice on diet and physi-
cal activity) and were followed for an average of 2 – 3
years. In the intervention group each subject received indi-
vidual counselling aimed at achieving at least 5 % weight
reduction, decreasing total and saturated fat intake, increas-
ing ﬁbre intake to at least 3·6 g/MJ and increasing physical
activity to at least 30 min/d. After 2 years, the intervention
group achieved a 3·5 kg weight loss and the control group

0·8 kg; the incidence of diabetes after 4 years was 11 (95 %
CI 6, 15) % in the intervention group and 23 (95 % CI 17,
29) % in the control group, with a 58 % reduction in risk
for diabetes in the intervention group. Given the multifac-
torial nature of the intervention, the study showed that dia-
betes prevention increased in parallel with the number of
successful
achieved (body weight
reduction , 5 %, saturated fat , 10 %, total fat , 30 %,
dietary ﬁbre . 3·6 g/MJ, physical exercise of any type
. 4 h per week).

lifestyle

changes

In the Diabetes Prevention Program Study (Diabetes
Prevention Program Research Group, 2002) 3234 subjects
with both impaired glucose tolerance and impaired fasting
glucose were randomly assigned to three groups: control
group; metformin group; lifestyle intervention group. In
this last group the main aims were to reduce weight by
7 % and increase exercise to at least 150 min per week;
diet composition was changed in the lifestyle intervention
group, aiming at a reduced intake of fat, particularly satu-
rated fat. In subjects assigned to the intensive lifestyle
intervention, the incidence of type 2 diabetes was reduced
by 58 % compared with the control group. Remarkably,
this study shows that lifestyle intervention is signiﬁcantly
more effective than metformin, an antidiabetic drug, in dia-
betes prevention. In particular, this difference between life-
style intervention and metformin was more pronounced in
individuals aged . 60 years and with a BMI , 35 kg/m2,
who represent
the large majority of the population at
risk. The results of this study are in agreement with
those of the Finnish study (Tuomı`lehto et al. 2001), as
both indicate that to prevent one case of diabetes, seven
subjects with impaired glucose tolerance must be treated
for 3 years.

These studies demonstrate that type 2 diabetes can be
prevented by lifestyle changes. The interventions always
included body-weight reduction, but involved multifactor-
ial approaches that also considered changes in diet compo-
sition. The average amount of weight loss achieved in the
lifestyle intervention groups was not
large (about 5 %
initial weight) and in any case was much less than the
weight loss traditionally considered as clinically signiﬁ-
cant. Despite the common scepticism towards the capacity
to induce lifestyle changes in overweight sedentary people,
the two studies report a drop-out rate of only 9 % in the
intervention group (not much greater than the 7 % observed
in the control group); moreover, a large proportion of them

were able to modify their lifestyles. However, we do not
know whether the intervention programme was successful
in inﬂuencing diet and physical activity in a sustained
way. This is not a trivial problem since 3 or 4 years are
only a small portion of an individual’s life.

Noteworthy within this context is the importance of exer-
cise in the prevention of diabetes, as demonstrated by these
intervention studies: in the Da Qing Study the exercise
group reported a 46 % decrease in incidence of type 2 dia-
betes (Pan et al. 1997); in the Finnish Diabetes Prevention
Study, the intervention group who achieved the exercise
goal (moderate exercise for at least 30 min/d) had an odds
ratio 0·3 for diabetes compared with the control group
(95 % CI 0·1, 0·7) (Tuomı`lehto et al. 2001). Similar results
were obtained in the Diabetes Prevention Program Study
(Diabetes Prevention Program Research Group, 2002).

The beneﬁcial effect of exercise on the risk of diabetes
may act through a direct effect on insulin sensitivity or a
decrease in body weight. There is considerable evidence
that physical activity per se improves insulin resistance
in normal subjects and diabetic patients (Ebeling et al.
1993; Dela et al. 1994; Mayer-Davis et al. 1998). In
addition, in some cases it may also help to lose and main-
tain weight (if energy intake is kept under control).

Proposals for an integrated approach to reducing the
risk of type 2 diabetes at the population level

therefore, any attempt

For many years, those who are overweight and have seden-
tary lifestyles have been considered at risk for type 2 dia-
betes. However, until very recently no properly controlled
studies were available to show that lifestyle changes can
delay the onset of diabetes;
to
devote time and resources to set up a programme of pri-
mary prevention for type 2 diabetes was deemed inap-
propriate, not only at the political level, but also by the
healthcare providers who deal with the devastating effects
of this disease every day. In view of all the new evidence
accumulated in the last 5 – 10 years, most of which has
been reviewed in the present paper, the time has come to
set up such a programme. However, whether primary pre-
vention of type 2 diabetes is feasible and effective at the
population levels still remains to be evaluated.

In many ways, this condition provides an ideal target for
prevention, since it meets all the requirements that a pri-
mary prevention programme should have to be of real
value: (1) high prevalence; (2) a serious condition with
potentially disabling complications; (3) risk factors associ-
ated with lifestyle and that can be modiﬁed; (4) the possi-
bility of identiﬁcation of individuals at risk by screening
(American Diabetes Association & National Institute of
Diabetes, Digestive & Kidney Diseases, 2002).

Moreover, current evidence shows that lifestyle changes,
to be effective, should not be ‘heroic’ so as to be sustainable
for years (i.e. weight reduction of 4 kg or approximately 5 %
initial weight) (Tuomı`lehto et al. 2001; Diabetes Prevention
Program Research Group, 2002). Some recent intervention
studies clearly show that people from different countries,
with different ethnic and socio-economic backgrounds,
can modify their long-term dietary habits and level of
physical activity if adequately motivated and supported.

However, since the participants in these studies were at
high risk for diabetes, the intervention employed was very
intensive and consequently very demanding in terms of
both economic resources and operators’ time. It remains
to be elucidated whether a less intensive intervention
might be effective in modifying lifestyle and beneﬁcially
inﬂuencing diabetes prevention in the general population.
The best approach would probably be a combination of
a population strategy associated with a more intensive
intervention targeted at high-risk individuals (American
Diabetes Association and National Institute of Diabetes,
Digestive and Kidney Diseases, 2002).

On the basis of the available evidence, it seems reason-
able to attempt a multifactorial rather than a monofactorial
intervention, because it allows more ﬂexibility and thus
accounts for
the individual’s capacity to act on and
modify one or more lifestyle behaviours at risk (Hu et al.
2001; Perry, 2002; van Dam et al. 2002b). Moreover,
since lifestyle modiﬁcations have an additive effect on dia-
betes prevention, a multifactorial approach might also
amplify the efﬁcacy of
the intervention. Additional
research is needed to identify the most cost-effective strat-
egies for a sustained achievement. For the time being, how-
ever, patients with abnormalities of blood glucose
regulation considered as being in a pre-diabetic state
(impaired glucose tolerance or impaired fasting glucose)
should undergo routine follow-up and be constantly
advised to lose weight and increase their levels of physical
activity to reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes. The lifestyle
factors
that have been consistently associated with
increased risk of type 2 diabetes are overweight and physi-
cal inactivity. However, recent evidence from epidemiolo-
gical studies reviewed in the present paper has shown that
the risk of type 2 diabetes is also associated with: (1) a low
ﬁbre intake; (2) a high trans fatty acid intake and a low
unsaturated fat:saturated fat intake ratio; (3) absence of
or excess alcohol consumption. All these factors are extre-
mely common in Western populations and therefore the
potential
impact of any intervention on them is large.
Indeed, taking into account these risk factors for type 2 dia-
betes, only 9·5 % of women recruited in an observational
study in the USA were in the low-risk category. The ability
to correct these behaviours in the rest of the population was
estimated to reduce the incidence of diabetes by as much as
87 % (Hu et al. 2001). However, incontrovertible evidence
that each of these lifestyle modiﬁcations can reduce the
risk of diabetes is not available, since controlled interven-
tion studies with a monofactorial design have not been pro-
duced for these measures.

In conclusion, it is possible to achieve primary preven-
tion of type 2 diabetes by means of intensive interventions
in high-risk individuals, in whom they have proven to be
effective. Appropriate strategies to identify high-risk indi-
viduals in a simple and inexpensive way are urgently war-
ranted. Although the beneﬁts of
intensive
intervention at the level of the general population cannot
be presently quantiﬁed,
it seems reasonable to convey
appropriate messages to the public in order to modify the
extremely common habits associated with an increased
risk of type 2 diabetes. This is especially desirable since
they are also linked with an high risk for CVD. New
