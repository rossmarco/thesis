ABSTRACT
Background: Potatoes, a high glycemic form of carbohydrate, are
hypothesized to increase insulin resistance and risk of type 2 diabe-
tes.
Objective: The objective was to examine prospectively the relation
between potato consumption and the risk of type 2 diabetes.
Design: We conducted a prospective study of 84 555 women in the
Nurses’ Health Study. At baseline, the women were aged 34 –59 y,
had no history of chronic disease, and completed a validated food-
frequency questionnaire. The participants were followed for 20 y
with repeated assessment of diet.
Results: We documented 4496 new cases of type 2 diabetes. Potato
and french fry consumption were both positively associated with risk
of type 2 diabetes after adjustment for age and dietary and nondietary
factors. The multivariate relative risk (RR) in a comparison between
the highest and the lowest quintile of potato intake was 1.14 (95% CI:
1.02, 1.26; P for trend ҃ 0.009). The multivariate RR in a compar-
ison between the highest and the lowest quintile of french fry intake
was 1.21 (95% CI: 1.09, 1.33; P for trend 쏝 0.0001). The RR of type
2 diabetes was 1.18 (95% CI: 1.03, 1.35) for 1 daily serving of
potatoes and 1.16 (95% CI: 1.05, 1.29) for 2 weekly servings of
french fries. The RR of type 2 diabetes for substituting 1 serving
potatoes/d for 1 serving whole grains/d was 1.30 (95% CI: 1.08,
1.57). The association between potato consumption and risk of type
2 diabetes was more pronounced in obese women.
Conclusions: Our findings suggest a modest positive association
between the consumption of potatoes and the risk of type 2 diabetes
in women. This association was more pronounced when potatoes
were substituted for whole grains.

INTRODUCTION

The role of potatoes in a diet aimed at reducing the burden of
chronic disease has been controversial. In both the 1992 US
Department of Agriculture (USDA) Food Guide Pyramid (1) and
the 2005 revision (2), potatoes were included in the vegetable
category as a food to be encouraged. Potatoes were also empha-
sized as a healthful food by a variety of professional and medical
organizations, including the American Dietetic Association and
the American Heart Association (3, 4). However, in a review by
the World Cancer Research Fund (5), potatoes did not share the
beneficial relation with cancer incidence seen with other vege-
tables. Concerns were also raised about possible adverse effects

of high potato consumption on the risk of type 2 diabetes because
they contain large amounts of rapidly absorbed starch and thus
are important contributors to dietary glycemic index (GI) and
load.

The GI of a carbohydrate is a measure of how much that food
raises blood glucose compared with a standard carbohydrate,
usually glucose or white bread (6). Potatoes and potato products
are widely consumed in the United States, with a per capita
consumption of 61.2 kg (135 pounds) in 2002 (7). White potatoes
have both a high GI and a high glycemic load, which takes into
account the amount of carbohydrate in addition to its GI (8).
Several studies have shown a positive association between a high
glycemic diet and the risk of type 2 diabetes (9 –11), whereas
others with less comprehensive dietary data have not observed
this association (12, 13). In the present study, we examined
prospectively the association between the consumption of potato
products and the incidence of type 2 diabetes in women from the
Nurses’ Health Study. Because a person’s response to a given
carbohydrate load may be influenced by underlying insulin re-
sistance, which is common in those with higher body mass in-
dexes (BMIs; in kg/m2) and lower levels of physical activity (14,
15), we examined the association between potato products and
the risk of type 2 diabetes by stratifying on these factors. We also
compared consumption of potatoes with whole grains, which are
related to a lower risk of type 2 diabetes and are encouraged by
the 2005 Dietary Guidelines, and to refined starches, which are
limited by the new guidelines.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS

Study population

The Nurses’ Health Study was initiated in 1976 when 121 700
female registered nurses aged 30 –55 y completed a mailed ques-
tionnaire. Ninety-eight percent of these women were white,

which reflected the ethnic composition of US registered nurses at
the time. Since 1976, information on disease status as well as
lifestyle factors has been collected every 2 y. Diet was assessed
by means of a semiquantitative food-frequency questionnaire
(FFQ) in 1980, 1984, 1986, 1990, 1994, and 1998.

For this investigation, we excluded all women at baseline who
left 욷10 food items blank or had implausibly high (쏜3500 kcal)
or low (쏝500 kcal) energy intakes on the semiquantitative FFQ.
We also excluded women with a history of diabetes, cancer (not
including nonmelanoma skin cancer), or cardiovascular disease
at baseline because these diseases can cause alterations in diets.
After these exclusions, 84 555 women remained in this investi-
gation. The participants were followed for 20 y (1980 –2000).
The study was conducted according to the ethical guidelines of
Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Boston, MA.

Dietary assessment

At baseline, the semiquantitative FFQ contained 61 food items
and was revised in subsequent cycles to include about twice that
number (16, 17). The study participants reported the average
frequency of consumption of foods with a commonly used por-
tion size throughout the previous year. The validity and repro-
ducibility of the questionnaire are documented elsewhere (17).
We asked each participant how often, on average, they had
consumed potatoes [serving size: 1 baked or 237 mL (1 cup)
mashed potato] in the previous year. We also asked how often
each participant had consumed french fried potatoes during the
previous year [serving size: 113 g (4 ounces)]. The possible
responses ranged from never or 쏝1/mo to 욷6 times/d. When
corrected for week-to-week variations in diet records that were
used to assess validity, the correlation between the 1980 FFQ and
the diet records was 0.66 for potatoes and 0.60 for french fries
(18).

Other nutrient values such as trans fat, saturated fat, polyun-
saturated fat, and cereal fiber were computed by multiplying the
frequency of consumption of each food by the nutrient content of
the portion and then adding these products across each food item.
All food composition values were obtained from the Harvard
University Food Composition Database, which was derived from
USDA sources (19). This database was further supplemented
with the manufacturer’s information.

Measurement of nondietary factors

In 1982 and 1988, the women provided information about
family history of diabetes in first-degree relatives. The partici-
pants also provided information on the use of postmenopausal
hormones, smoking status, and body weight every 2 y throughout
the follow-up. The correlation coefficient between self-reported
body weight and measured weight was 0.96 (20).

The participants reported specific physical activities in hours
per week in 1980, 1982, 1986, 1988, 1992, 1996, and 1998. From
each questionnaire we calculated the average number of hours
per week spent in moderate or vigorous activity, including brisk
walking, vigorous sports, jogging, cycling, heavy gardening, and
housework.

Outcome ascertainment

The outcome of the present study was incident type 2 diabetes
mellitus. If a participant reported a diagnosis of diabetes on any

of the 2-y follow-up questionnaires, a supplementary question-
naire about symptoms, diagnostic testing, and treatment was
mailed. A diagnosis of type 2 diabetes was defined by at least one
of the following criteria reported on the supplemental question-
naire: 1) 욷1 classic symptoms (excessive thirst, polyuria, hun-
ger, or weight loss) plus a fasting plasma glucose concentration
of 욷140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L) or a random plasma glucose con-
centration of 욷200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L); 2) 욷2 elevated
plasma glucose concentrations on different occasions [fasting:
욷140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L), random 욷200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/
L)] or random 욷200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) after 욷2 h oral-
glucose-tolerance testing, in the absence of symptoms; or 3)
treatment with hypoglycemic medications (insulin or oral hypo-
glycemic agents). These criteria correspond to those of the Na-
tional Diabetes Data Group (21) because most cases were diag-
nosed before 1997. We excluded women classified as having
only gestational diabetes as well as those with type 1 diabetes. In
the Nurses’ Health Study, the supplemental questionnaire was
highly reliable in obtaining confirmation of a diabetes diagnosis.
In a random sample of 84 women classified as having type 2
diabetes according to the supplemental questionnaire, medical
records were available for 62 of them. An endocrinologist who
was blinded to the supplemental questionnaire data reviewed the
records and confirmed the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes in 61 of
the 62 (98%) women (22).

Statistical analysis

Each participant contributed follow-up time from the date of
returning the 1980 baseline questionnaire to the date of diagnosis
of type 2 diabetes, 1 June 2000, or death. Women were excluded
from additional follow-up once they were diagnosed with dia-
betes. We divided the participants into 5 categories (quintiles)
according to the frequency of potato consumption. To represent
long-term intake and to reduce measurement error, the cumula-
tive frequency of consumption was calculated (23). For example,
potato intake from the 1980 questionnaire was related to diabetes
incidence between 1980 and 1984, and potato intake from the
average of the 1980 and 1984 questionnaires was related to di-
abetes incidence between 1984 and 1986. We also created quin-
tiles of cumulative french fry consumption. Incidence rates for
type 2 diabetes were calculated by dividing cases by the person-
years of follow-up for each quintile of potato intake. Relative
risks (RRs) of type 2 diabetes were calculated by dividing the rate
of occurrence of diabetes in each quintile by the rate in the first
(lowest) quintile. We used Cox proportional hazards models (24)
to adjust for potentially confounding variables, which included
BMI, family history of diabetes, smoking, postmenopausal hor-
mone use, and physical activity. We additionally adjusted for
dietary variables, including trans fat, the ratio of polyunsaturated
fat to saturated fat, cereal fiber, and total calories. We also con-
sidered potatoes and whole grains as continuous variables in the
same model. The difference in the coefficients from this multi-
variate model was used to estimate the RR and 95% CI for
substituting 1 serving potatoes/d for 1 serving whole grains and
refined grains/d.

All P values were two-sided. Tests for trend were examined by
using the median value for each category of potato consumption,
which was analyzed as a continuous variable in the regression
models. All statistical analyses were performed with SAS ver-
sion 8.2 software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).

RESULTS

At baseline in 1980, potato consumption ranged from a median
of 0.07 serving/d in the first quintile to 0.79 serving/d in the highest
quintile. French fry intake was considerably less; the median for the
lowest quintile was zero servings, whereas the median in the highest
quintile was just 0.14 serving/d. Potato and french fry consumption
was largely consistent over time (overall x៮앐 SD: 0.32 앐 0.23 serv-
ings potatoes/d for potato and 0.07 앐 0.08 servings french fries/d).
This amount of consumption is similar to that of the general US
population during the years 1980–2000 (25). The women who con-
sumed more potatoes tended to have a higher dietary glycemic load
and higher intakes of red meat, refined grain, and total calories.
They were also less likely to take postmenopausal hormone ther-
apy. Family history of diabetes, trans fat intake, BMI, and physical
activity were not significantly different across quintiles (Table 1).
The women who consumed more french fries tended to have a
higher dietary glycemic load and higher intakes of red meat, refined
grain, and total calories. They were more likely to smoke but were
less likely to take multivitamins and postmenopausal hormone ther-
apy. Family history of diabetes, trans fat intake, BMI, and physical
activity were not significantly different across quintiles (Table 1).
Because of the length of follow-up (20 y), the characteristics in
Table 1 are presented as the midpoint of follow-up (1990) rather
than baseline (1980).

During the 20 y of follow-up (1 597 429 person-years), we
documented 4496 cases of type 2 diabetes. For potatoes, the
age-adjusted RR of type 2 diabetes was 1.13 (95% CI: 1.03, 1.25)

in a comparison between the women in the fifth quintile and those
in the first quintile (P for trend ҃ 0.02) (Table 2). In multivariate
models, the addition of BMI as a categorical variable (10 cate-
gories) slightly increased the RR to 1.18 (95% CI: 1.07, 1.30;
P for trend ҃ 0.0003). The RR did not change appreciably after
additional control for smoking, family history of diabetes, phys-
ical activity, and postmenopausal hormone use (1.17; 95% CI:
1.06, 1.29; P for trend ҃ 0.0004). After additional control for
other dietary variables (trans fat intake, polyunsaturated fat-to-
saturated fat ratio, total calories, and cereal fiber), the RR was
slightly attenuated to 1.14 (95% CI: 1.02, 1.26; P for trend ҃
0.009). Additional adjustment for consumption of nuts, coffee,
alcohol, fruit, vegetables, whole grains, and soft drinks did not
appreciably change the results.

The age-adjusted RR that compared the highest quintile of
french fry intake (0.14 servings/d) with the lowest quintile (0
servings/d) was 1.65 (95% CI: 1.50, 1.80; P for trend 쏝 0.0001)
(Table 2). The addition of BMI to the model attenuated the RR to
1.29 (95% CI: 1.17, 1.41; P for trend 쏝 0.0001). The RR was
further attenuated to 1.25 (95% CI: 1.14, 1.37, P for trend 쏝
0.0001) after additional adjustment for smoking, family history,
physical activity, and postmenopausal hormone use. After addi-
tional control for dietary variables such as trans fat intake, the
polyunsaturated fat-to-saturated fat ratio, total calories, and ce-
real fiber, the RR was 1.21 (95% CI: 1.09, 1.33; P for trend 쏝
0.0001). Additional adjustment for consumption of nuts, coffee,

alcohol, fruit, vegetables, whole grains, and soft drinks did not
appreciably change the results.

In additional analyses that used potato consumption as a con-
tinuous variable, the multivariate RR of type 2 diabetes for con-
suming 1 serving potatoes/d [237 mL (1 cup) mashed or 1 baked]
was 1.18 (95% CI: 1.03, 1.35) (Table 2). The multivariate RR for
2 [113 g (4 oz)] servings french fries/wk was 1.16 (95% CI: 1.05,
1.29) (Table 2). Furthermore, the RR of substituting 1 serving
potatoes/d for 1 serving whole grains/d was 1.30 (95% CI: 1.08,
1.57). The RR of substituting 1 serving potatoes/d for 1 serving
refined grains/d was 1.22 (95% CI: 1.01, 1.47).

In stratified analyses, the association between potato con-
sumption and diabetes was statistically significant in obese
women but not in nonobese women (P for interaction ҃ 0.01)
(Table 3). This was not observed for french fry consumption. No
significant interaction was observed between the consumption of
potatoes or french fries and physical activity or family history of
type 2 diabetes.

In our cohort, red meat was significantly correlated with con-
sumption of potatoes (r ҃ 0.24, P 쏝 0.0001) and french fries
(r ҃ 0.29, P 쏝 0.0001). When red meat consumption was added

to the multivariate models,
the association was slightly
attenuated. For potato intake, the RR of type 2 diabetes in a
comparison of the fifth quintile with the first quintile was 1.12
(95% CI: 1.01, 1.25; P for trend ҃ 0.02). A similar attenuation in
RR was seen for french fries (1.19; 95% CI: 1.07, 1.31; P for
trend ҃ 0.0004).

To examine whether the associations between potatoes and
french fry intake were mediated through a higher glycemic load,
we added glycemic load to the multivariate models. After ad-
justment for glycemic load, the RRs in a comparison of extreme
quintiles were 1.06 (95% CI: 0.95, 1.18; P for trend ҃ 0.24) for
potatoes and 1.15 (95% CI: 1.04, 1.27; P for trend ҃ 0.005) for
french fries.

DISCUSSION

We found that the intakes of potatoes and french fries were
positively associated with the incidence of type 2 diabetes in this
large prospective cohort of women. The increased risk was more
pronounced when potatoes replaced whole-grain products in the
diet. This association was independent of known risk factors for

type 2 diabetes, including family history, age, BMI, physical
activity, smoking status, postmenopausal hormone use, and di-
etary factors. As expected, the positive association between po-
tato consumption and the risk of type 2 diabetes was seen pri-
marily in obese and sedentary women. These participants are
more likely to have underlying insulin resistance, which may
exacerbate the adverse metabolic effects of higher glycemic car-
bohydrates (14, 15).

French fries are usually composed of white potatoes and par-
tially hydrogenated oils containing trans fat. In our cohort, trans
fat was positively associated with an increased risk of type 2
diabetes (26). This may partially explain why french fries had a
stronger association with type 2 diabetes than did potatoes. How-
ever, adjustment for trans fat did not eliminate the association
with french fries.

The 20-y follow-up with updated dietary data and large sample
size provided adequate power for the present study. Bias was
minimized by the prospective design and the high follow-up rate.
Some misclassification of intakes of potatoes and french fries
existed because diet was assessed by self-report. However, this
misclassification would tend to bias the results toward the null
and therefore would not likely account for these results. Mea-
surement error in assessing long-term diet was reduced in the
present analyses by using the average of all available measure-
ments of diet up to the start of each 2-y follow-up interval (27,
28).

Although we assessed and adjusted for a variety of potential
confounding variables, we cannot rule out the possibility of re-
sidual confounding, especially because the observed association
between potatoes and the risk of type 2 diabetes was modest in the
present study. This population consisted of mostly white women
with some college education. Although this homogeneity in-
creases the internal validity of the study by reducing confounding
by factors that are difficult to measure, the association between
potatoes and the risk of type 2 diabetes in women of other racial
and educational backgrounds should also be evaluated. Precook-
ing potatoes and eating them cold days later may significantly
reduce the GI (29). Although we did not assess cooking methods
in the FFQ, we believe most of the potatoes consumed in our
cohort were eaten hot shortly after preparation.

The high glycemic load of potato products is a likely mecha-
nism by which they may increase the risk of type 2 diabetes. In

our analyses, adjustment for glycemic load attenuated the asso-
ciations between potatoes and diabetes risk, which suggests that
most or all of the association was mediated through the high
glycemic load. However, a significant association persisted for
french fries after adjustment for glycemic load, which probably
suggests that other components, including trans fat, also contrib-
ute to the adverse effects of french fries. Several prospective
studies have supported a positive association between a high GI
or glycemic load diet and the risk of type 2 diabetes. Salmeron et
al (9, 10) conducted 2 prospective cohort investigations about GI
and type 2 diabetes. In the Nurses’ Health Study, the women in
the highest quintile of GI had a RR of type 2 diabetes of 1.37 (95%
CI: 1.09, 1.71) compared with those in the lowest quintile. The
glycemic load was also positively associated with risk (1.47;
95% CI: 1.16, 1.86) (9), which was confirmed in an extended
follow-up of this population (30). In the all-male Health Profes-
sionals Follow-up cohort, the GI was positively associated with
the risk of type 2 diabetes. Men in the highest quintile had a RR
of 1.37 (95% CI: 1.02, 1.83) compared with men in the lowest
quintile (10). Furthermore, in the younger Nurses’ Health II
cohort, GI was significantly associated with an increased risk of
type 2 diabetes, with an RR of 1.59 (95% CI: 1.21, 2.10) in a
comparison of the fifth quintile with the first quintile (11).

In contrast, Meyer et al (13) reported no association between
GI and the risk of type 2 diabetes in the Iowa Women’s Health
Study. However, only baseline nutritional data were available for
the 6-y follow-up, and the validity of self-reported diabetes was
only moderate (64%). These factors may have lead to an under-
estimation of the association. Stevens et al (12) observed no
association between GI or glycemic load and the incidence of
type 2 diabetes in a 9-y cohort study of 12 251 adults. However,
after adjustment for cereal fiber, the association between glyce-
mic load and type 2 diabetes became borderline significant in
whites (P ҃ 0.07). The use of a single baseline 66-item FFQ may
have attenuated the results. When we used only baseline data in
our cohort, the RR for potatoes was attenuated to 1.10 (95% CI:
0.99, 1.22; P for trend ҃ 0.23).

Few studies have examined the relation between the consump-
tion of potatoes or french fries and the risk of type 2 diabetes. In
a recent 8.8-y prospective investigation in the Women’s Health
Study, Liu et al (31) found a small and nonsignificant positive
association between potato intake and the risk of type 2 diabetes

the highest with the lowest quintiles ҃ 1.14; 95% CI: 0 0.95,
1.36: P for trend ҃ 0.12).

Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain how high
glycemic carbohydrates may increase the risk of type 2 diabetes.
Most stem from the greater increase in blood glucose and insulin
concentrations with high glycemic carbohydrates in comparison
to lower glycemic carbohydrates. High glucose concentrations
may cause oxidative stress to pancreatic ␤cells or glycosylation
of proteins and key enzymes responsible for metabolic processes
(32). This may lead to ␤-cell dysfunction and ultimately to type
2 diabetes. This would be manifested as ␤-cell exhaustion (14,
15, 33), when production of insulin can no longer meet the de-
mand. A recent investigation in rats showed a severely disorga-
nized architecture and extensive fibrosis of pancreatic islets after
18 wk on a high glycemic diet (34).

Another potential mechanism is that of lipotoxicity (32, 35–
39). Four to 6 h after consumption of a high glycemic carbohy-
drate, low concentrations of metabolic fuels trigger a counter-
regulatory hormone response that attempts to restore euglycemia
by stimulating glycogenolytic and gluconeogenic pathways and
elevating free fatty acid concentrations (35). This elevation in
free fatty acids may increase insulin resistance by decreasing
insulin-stimulated glucose uptake (36, 37).

The importance of the GI when carbohydrates are consumed as
part of a mixed meal has been controversial. One investigation
reported that when carbohydrates were consumed with fat and
protein, the GI was no longer a significant predictor of blood
glucose concentrations (40). However, a larger number of pub-
lished reports have shown that the GI remains discriminating
even in mixed meals (41– 48). Therefore, the weight of evidence
suggests that even when incorporated into a mixed meal, the GI
of carbohydrate remains a significant predictor of blood glucose,
although this effect may be somewhat attenuated. Even though
the GI of the potatoes in a mixed meal is reduced, this would not
affect the relative ranking of GIs between different persons. Also,
control for dietary fat and protein did not substantially change our
results.

White potatoes and french fries are large components of a
“Western pattern” diet. This dietary pattern is characterized by a
high consumption of red meat, refined grains, processed meat,
high-fat dairy products, desserts, high-sugar drinks, and eggs, as
well as french fries and potatoes. A Western pattern diet previ-
ously predicted a risk of type 2 diabetes (49). Thus, we cannot
completely separate the effects of potatoes and french fries from
the effects of the overall Western dietary pattern.

In conclusion, a higher consumption of potatoes and french
fries was associated with a modestly increased risk of type 2
diabetes in this large cohort of women. These data support a
potential benefit from limiting the consumption of these foods in
reducing the risk of type 2 diabetes. Substitution of these sources
of carbohydrate with lower glycemic, high-fiber forms of carbo-
hydrates such as whole grains should be encouraged.
