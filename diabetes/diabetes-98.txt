Review and a Dose-Response
Meta-analysis

and Frank B. Hu1,3,4

OBJECTIVE
Previous meta-analyses identiﬁed an inverse association of coffee consumption
with the risk of type 2 diabetes. However, an updated meta-analysis is needed
because new studies comparing the trends of association for caffeinated and
decaffeinated coffee have since been published.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
PubMed and Embase were searched for cohort or nested case-control studies
that assessed the relationship of coffee consumption and risk of type 2 diabetes
from 1966 to February 2013. A restricted cubic spline random-effects model was used.

RESULTS
Twenty-eight prospective studies were included in the analysis, with 1,109,272
study participants and 45,335 cases of type 2 diabetes. The follow-up duration
ranged from 10 months to 20 years. Compared with no or rare coffee consump-
tion, the relative risk (RR; 95% CI) for diabetes was 0.92 (0.90–0.94), 0.85 (0.82–
0.88), 0.79 (0.75–0.83), 0.75 (0.71–0.80), 0.71 (0.65–0.76), and 0.67 (0.61–0.74) for
1–6 cups/day, respectively. The RR of diabetes for a 1 cup/day increase was 0.91
(0.89–0.94) for caffeinated coffee consumption and 0.94 (0.91–0.98) for decaf-
feinated coffee consumption (P for difference = 0.17).

CONCLUSIONS
Coffee consumption was inversely associated with the risk of type 2 diabetes in a
dose-response manner. Both caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee was associated
with reduced diabetes risk.

Type 2 diabetes is a chronic disease with high rates of morbidity and mortality. The
worldwide prevalence of type 2 diabetes is increasing, and the global number of
people with diabetes is estimated to reach 366 million by the year 2030 (1). The risk
of blindness, renal disease, and amputation among those with type 2 diabetes is 20
to 40 times higher than that of people without diabetes. Furthermore, those with
type 2 diabetes have a two to ﬁve times higher risk of myocardial infarction and two
to three times higher risk of stroke (2). Given its signiﬁcant burden, identifying
modiﬁable lifestyle factors is imperative for the prevention of diabetes.

Coffee and Risk of Type 2 Diabetes

Diabetes Care Volume 37, February 2014

Coffee is one of the most widely
consumed beverages around the world;
thus, investigating its association with
various diseases has important public
health implications. An inverse
association between coffee consumption
and risk of type 2 diabetes was ﬁrst
reported in a Dutch population (3). In
subsequent years, this ﬁnding has been
conﬁrmed in most (4–10) but not all (11–
13) studies. Two previous meta-analyses
of coffee consumption and risk of type 2
diabetes have been published. van Dam
and Hu (14) included nine cohort studies
and reported a lower risk of type 2
diabetes for high coffee consumption
compared with no coffee consumption
with little between-study heterogeneity.
Huxley et al. (15) included 18 prospective
studies and found an inverse monotonous
association between the number of cups
of coffee consumed and diabetes risk, but
they double-counted data from the same
cohort (16,17). Since the publication of
these meta-analyses, 10 additional
prospective studies on the association
between coffee consumption and
diabetes have been published
(6,8,10,12,18–23).

A key issue that remains to be resolved is
whether consumption of caffeinated and
decaffeinated coffee is similarly
associated with the risk of type 2 diabetes.
Such results would provide insight into
the role of caffeine in the putative
relationship between coffee consumption
and diabetes risk. The meta-analysis by
Huxley et al. (15) included only six studies
on decaffeinated coffee, and estimates
were less precise than for caffeinated
coffee because of lower consumption
levels. Eight subsequent prospective
studies evaluated the association with
decaffeinated coffee, approximately
doubling the amount of data on
decaffeinated coffee and diabetes risk
(8,10,12,18–21,24). We therefore
performed an updated systematic review
and a dose-response meta-analysis of all
available data on the association of both
caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee
consumption with the risk of type 2
diabetes.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
Search Strategy and Selection Criteria
We searched the PubMed and Embase
databases for prospective cohort

studies or nested case-control studies
that evaluated the association between
coffee consumption and risk of type 2
diabetes between January 1966 and
February 2013. The computer-based
searches included the key words coffee
and diabetes. No Medical Subject
Headings terms were used because of
the clear deﬁnitions of coffee and
diabetes. Reference lists of retrieved
articles were manually scanned for all
relevant additional studies and review
articles. We restricted the search to
studies on humans and written in English.

Study Selection
Studies included in this meta-analysis
met the following criteria: 1) the study
design was prospective cohort or nested
case-control; 2) the articles were
published in English; 3) the exposure
was categorized coffee consumption,
including total coffee, caffeinated
coffee, or decaffeinated coffee; and 4)
the outcome was risk of type 2 diabetes.
Studies were excluded if they were
cross-sectional in design and if
information on dose-response modeling
was inadequate, including the number
of participants and cases, relative risk
(RR) and SE for the estimate, and dose of
coffee consumption in each exposure
category.

Data Extraction and Quality
Assessment
One author (M.D.) assessed study
eligibility and extracted the data, and
another (M.C.) independently double-
checked the available data. The
following data were extracted from
each study: ﬁrst author’s name, year of
publication, geographical location,
follow-up time, sex, age, number of type
2 diabetes events, number of
participants, categories of coffee
consumption, type of assessment of
type 2 diabetes, covariates adjusted for
in the multivariable analysis, and RRs for
all categories of coffee consumption. If
studies based on the same cohort were
published several times, only the most
recent article was selected. If a study
only reported caffeinated coffee
consumption instead of total coffee
consumption, caffeinated coffee
consumption was also included in the
total coffee consumption analysis. The
Newcastle-Ottawa quality assessment

scale (NOS) was used to evaluate the
study quality of the included articles.
The scale ranges from 0 to 9 points, with
higher points indicating higher study
quality. Speciﬁcally, loss to follow-up
was assessed as an item in the NOS for
individual studies. In the present meta-
analysis, we assumed that loss to follow-
up was random.

To perform a dose-response meta-
analysis, we assigned the median or
mean coffee consumption in each
category of consumption to the
corresponding RR for each study. If the
mean or median consumption per
category was not reported, the
midpoint of the upper and lower
boundaries in each category was
assigned as the mean consumption. If
the upper boundary for the highest
category was not provided, the assigned
mean value was 25% higher than the
lower boundary of that category. If the
lower boundary for the lowest category
was not provided, the assigned mean
value was one-half of the upper
boundary of that category.

Data Synthesis and Analysis
To analyze the trend of coffee
consumption and risk of type 2 diabetes,
we used both semiparametric and
parametric methods. For the
semiparametric method, four coffee
consumption groups were generated,
namely lowest, third highest, second
highest, and highest. For each included
study, the lowest and the highest coffee
consumption categories corresponded
to the lowest and highest groups,
respectively. For studies with four
exposure categories, the second and
third categories corresponded to the
second and third highest groups,
respectively. For studies with three
exposure categories, the middle
category corresponded to either the
second or the third highest group,
whichever median coffee consumption
amount was most similar. If the study
had more than four exposure
categories, two consumption groups,
other than the lowest and highest, were
chosen on the basis of their similarity of
the amount of coffee consumption in
that category to the second and third
highest groups. For each group, a
random-effects model was used to pool
the RR of type 2 diabetes (25). Statistical

heterogeneity in each group was
assessed by Cochrane Q test, with P ,
0.1 indicating signiﬁcant between-study
heterogeneity.

For the parametric method, a random-
effects dose-response meta-analysis
was performed (26). The number of
cases and participants in each coffee
consumption category was extracted to
estimate the covariance of the RR in
each study. Together with the observed
adjusted variance of the RR, we
estimated the variance/covariance
matrix of the data. The weight of each
study was calculated as the inverse of
the variance/covariance matrix. We
used generalized least squares models
with maximum likelihood method to
estimate the coefﬁcients for each
study, and we ﬁt a random-effects
generalized linear model. Additionally,
we tested for potential nonlinearity
in the association between coffee
consumption and type 2 diabetes by a
random-effects restricted cubic spline
model with three knots. Stata
commands GLST for model ﬁtting and
LINCOME for estimating effect were
used for the ﬁtted model.

Stratiﬁed analyses were performed for
study location, sex, diabetes assessment

method, and type of coffee (i.e.,
caffeinated, decaffeinated), and the
subgroup difference was tested in the
association of coffee consumption with
risk of type 2 diabetes. We assessed the
potential for publication bias through a
formal Egger regression symmetry test.
All analyses were conducted with Stata
10 (StataCorp, College Station, TX)
statistical software.

RESULTS
Characteristics of Studies
The initial search identiﬁed 800
potentially relevant citations. After
screening titles and abstracts, we
identiﬁed 39 studies for further
evaluation (Fig. 1). We excluded six
studies with a cross-sectional study
design, three that were abstracts of
conference posters, and two that were
repeated in the same cohort. The results
of the remaining 28 studies, comprising
1,109,272 study participants and 45,335
cases of type 2 diabetes, were included
in the meta-analysis (3–13,17–24,27–
35). Characteristics of all 28 studies
were shown in Table 1. The duration of
follow-up for incident type 2 diabetes
ranged from 10 months to 20 years,
with a median follow-up of 11 years.

Thirteen studies were conducted in the
U.S., 11 in Europe, and 4 in Asia. In nine
studies, type 2 diabetes was self-
reported; the outcome of six studies was
assessed by means of a glucose
tolerance test, and the outcome of the
other studies was conﬁrmed by either
medical records or national registries.
One study was a nested case-control
design, and the remaining 27 were
prospective cohort studies. Ten studies
assessed both caffeinated and
decaffeinated coffee, and only one each
assessed caffeinated coffee and
decaffeinated coffee. Fifteen studies did
not distinguish caffeinated coffee and
decaffeinated coffee, and seven
assessed caffeine consumption. The
mean NOS score was 7 (of a possible 9
points), suggesting a high quality of the
studies included in the meta-analysis.
The points were mainly lost in exposure
assessment and adequacy of follow-up
of cohorts: Six studies assessed coffee
consumption by structured interview,
and ﬁve addressed the percentage of
loss to follow-up.

Coffee and Risk of Type 2 Diabetes

Diabetes Care Volume 37, February 2014

Figure 2—Forest plot of the associations between total coffee consumption and risk of type 2 diabetes. Compared with the lowest category (median
consumption 0 cups/day), the pooled RR for incident type 2 diabetes was 0.70 (95% CI 0.65–0.75, I2 = 50%, P for heterogeneity = 0.001) for the
highest category of consumption, 0.80 (0.75–0.85, I2 = 71%, P , 0.001) for the second highest, and 0.91 (0.88–0.94, I2 = 19%, P = 0.17) for the third
highest category of coffee consumption.

compared with the lowest category.
Compared with the lowest category
(median consumption 0 cups/day), the
pooled RR for incident type 2 diabetes
for individuals in the highest category
of consumption (5 cups/day) was 0.70
(95% CI 0.65–0.75, I2 = 50%, P for
heterogeneity = 0.001). The
corresponding RRs were 0.80 (0.75–
0.85, I2 = 71%, P , 0.001) for the
second highest category (3.5 cups/day)
and 0.91 (0.88–0.94, I2 = 19%, P = 0.17)
for the third highest category (1 cup/
day) of coffee consumption. Thus,
there was evidence for substantial
between-study heterogeneity in
results for the highest two categories
of coffee consumption.

Dose-Response Analyses of Total
Coffee Consumption and Risk of
Diabetes
We performed a dose-response meta-
analysis in 27 studies to test for a
linear trend between total coffee
consumption and risk of type 2 diabetes
and to estimate RRs for speciﬁc amounts
of coffee consumption. One study
included coffee consumption of .12

cups/day for the highest category (23);
we treated this observation as an outlier
and excluded it from the dose-response
analysis. There was a strong inverse
association between coffee
consumption and risk of type 2 diabetes
(Fig. 3). A cubic spline model accounted
for more variance in the outcome than
did a linear model (likelihood ratio test
P , 0.001), suggesting that the
association was not fully linear.
Compared with participants with no
coffee consumption, the RR estimated
directly from the cubic spline model
for 1–6 cups/day was 0.92 (95% CI
0.90–0.94), 0.85 (0.82–0.88), 0.79
(0.75–0.83), 0.75 (0.71–0.80), 0.71
(0.65–0.76), and 0.67 (0.61–0.74),
respectively.

To test whether the inverse association
between coffee consumption and risk
of type 2 diabetes was different for
unadjusted and adjusted RRs, we
performed a dose-response meta-
analysis of the unadjusted data in 27
studies (Supplementary Fig. 1). The
spline curve of the unadjusted data
was similar to that of the

multivariable-adjusted data, indicating
that adjustment for potential
confounders minimally affected effect
estimates for the association between
coffee consumption and a lower risk of
diabetes.

Comparison of Associations for
Caffeinated and Decaffeinated Coffee
Both caffeinated and decaffeinated
coffee consumption was inversely
associated with risk of type 2 diabetes
(Supplementary Fig. 2). Compared with
participants with the lowest level of
caffeinated coffee consumption, the RR
for incident type 2 diabetes was 0.74
(95% CI 0.67–0.81, I2 = 56%, P for
heterogeneity = 0.005) for the highest
category (median consumption 5 cups/
day), 0.82 (0.75–0.91, I2 = 74%,
P , 0.001) for the second highest
category (3.5 cups/day), and 0.92 (0.89–
0.96, I2 = 6.6%, P = 0.38) for the third
highest category (1 cup/day). Compared
with those with the lowest level of
decaffeinated coffee consumption, the
combined RR for incident type 2
diabetes was 0.80 (0.70–0.91, I2 = 62%,
P = 0.001) for the highest category

Figure 3—Dose-response analysis of the association between coffee consumption and risk of type 2 diabetes. For the overall association between

nested linear model, P , 0.001.

(4 cups/day), 0.95 (0.88–1.02, I2 = 53%,
P = 0.02) for the second highest category
(2 cups/day), and 0.98 (0.92–1.05, I2 =
62%, P = 0.003) for the third highest
category (0.5 cups/day). Heterogeneity
was shown for ﬁve of the six subgroups.
Seven of 12 studies adjusted for
caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee
consumption simultaneously. The
association was slightly stronger for
caffeinated coffee consumption than for
decaffeinated coffee consumption (P =
0.03 for the second highest group, P =
0.07 for the highest group)
(Supplementary Table 1).

We conducted a linear dose-response
analysis for caffeinated and
decaffeinated coffee consumption
separately (11 studies). For a 1 cup/day
increase in caffeinated coffee
consumption, the RR for type 2 diabetes
was 0.91 (95% CI 0.89–0.94), and for a
1 cup/day increase in decaffeinated
coffee consumption, the RR was 0.94
(0.91–0.98, P for difference = 0.17). We
performed a dose-response analysis
between caffeine consumption and type
2 diabetes risk based on seven of the
included studies (4,9,12,17,21,22,35)
and found that for every 140 mg/day
(;1 cup/day coffee) higher caffeine
consumption, the RR for type 2 diabetes
was 0.92 (0.90–0.94). Of note, none of

the included studies controlled for
coffee intake when modeling caffeine
intake and diabetes.

Stratiﬁed Analysis
In stratiﬁed analyses, the inverse
associations between coffee consumption
and risk of diabetes were similar by
geographical region (U.S., Europe, and
Asia), sex, and diabetes assessment
method (P for interaction . 0.05 for all
groups) (Supplementary Table 1).

Sensitivity Analysis
For the dose-response analysis of total
coffee consumption with diabetes, after
we included the observation with
extremely high coffee consumption
(23), the results did not change.
Signiﬁcant heterogeneity was found for
the highest and second highest total
coffee consumption, which might be
attributable to the heterogeneous
amount of coffee consumption in these
categories. The dose-response analysis
accounted for the heterogeneous
consumption amount of individual
studies and showed an appropriate
goodness of ﬁt (P = 0.14).

Heterogeneity was also found in
separate analyses of caffeinated and
decaffeinated coffee consumption. In
addition to considering different
consumption amounts, we stratiﬁed

the analyses by whether the
studies included caffeinated and
decaffeinated coffee consumption
simultaneously in the same model. In
these analyses, the heterogeneity at
each level of caffeinated and
decaffeinated coffee consumption
decreased signiﬁcantly, with even
more inverse results for both
caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee
consumption (Supplementary Fig. 3).

Publication Bias
The Egger test provided no evidence of
publication bias at any levels of total
coffee, caffeinated coffee, and
decaffeinated coffee consumption
(Supplementary Table 2).

CONCLUSIONS
The ﬁndings from this systematic review
and meta-analysis, based on 1,109,272
study participants and 45,335 cases of
type 2 diabetes, demonstrate a robust
inverse association between coffee
consumption and risk of diabetes.
Compared with no coffee consumption,
consumption of 6 cups/day of coffee
was associated with a 33% lower risk of
type 2 diabetes. Caffeinated coffee and
decaffeinated coffee consumption were
both associated with a lower risk of type
2 diabetes. The association between

Coffee and Risk of Type 2 Diabetes

coffee consumption and diabetes risk
was consistent for men and women and
for European, U.S., and Asian
populations.

There has been some debate about the
role of caffeine in the development of
insulin resistance and diabetes. Short-
term studies in humans have shown that
caffeine intake results in an acute
reduction of insulin sensitivity, which
may be due to adenosine receptor
antagonism and increased epinephrine
release caused by caffeine (36). Other
studies have found that when
controlling for total coffee intake,
caffeine intake was no longer associated
with diabetes risk (5,19). Nonetheless,
these results need to be interpreted
with caution because the high
correlation between coffee and caffeine
consumption makes it more difﬁcult to
separate their effects. The present
meta-analysis shows that both
caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee
consumption is associated with a lower
risk of diabetes. The results were more
inverse when only including the studies
adjusting for caffeinated and
decaffeinated coffee simultaneously in
the model. Because caffeinated coffee
consumption is inversely related to
decaffeinated coffee consumption,
caffeinated coffee is a positive
confounder for the association of
decaffeinated coffee with diabetes and
vice versa. Thus, the association is
strengthened when both variables are
adjusted simultaneously. Moreover,
because the consumption of caffeinated
coffee is much higher than decaffeinated
coffee, the results appear to be more
robust for caffeinated coffee. However,
the difference for continuous analysis
between caffeinated and decaffeinated
coffee (1 cup/day increment) was not
statistically signiﬁcant. These results
suggest that components of coffee other
than caffeine are responsible for this
putative beneﬁcial effect. Although the
present results show that higher caffeine
consumption is inversely associated with
the risk of diabetes, this association is
likely to be confounded by other
components of coffee because of the
collinearity of caffeine and those
components.

Plausible biological mechanisms that
may contribute to the inverse

association between coffee
consumption and diabetes risk have
been demonstrated in animal models
and in vitro studies implicating several
coffee components in reducing insulin
resistance and improving glucose
metabolism. Chlorogenic acid, a
phenolic compound, is a major
component of coffee and has been
shown to reduce blood glucose
concentrations in animal experiments
(37). Chlorogenic acid may reduce
glucose absorption in the intestines by
competitively inhibiting glucose-6-
phosphate translocase and reducing
sodium-dependent glucose transport in
the brush border membrane vesicles
(38), by reducing oxidative stress as a
result of its antioxidant properties, and
by reducing liver glucose output (39).
Other components of coffee may also
improve glucose metabolism, including
lignans, quinides, and trigonelline
(40–42). Coffee is also a good source of
magnesium, which has been associated
with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes (43).
However, adjustment for magnesium
intake did not substantially attenuate
the inverse association (4,5), suggesting
that other bioactive compounds in
coffee may also be responsible. In
addition, because some of the
compounds, such as lignans and
magnesium, also exist in other foods, it
is difﬁcult to attribute the beneﬁts of
coffee on diabetes to these speciﬁc
compounds only.

This meta-analysis has several
signiﬁcant strengths. The mean NOS
score of 7 of 9 ensured the relatively
high quality of the included studies. All
28 studies used a prospective design;
thus, the differential misclassiﬁcation
of coffee consumption attributable to
recall bias was minimized. Given the
observational nature of the studies,
residual confounding might be an
explanation for the ﬁndings. However,
higher coffee consumption was
generally associated with a less healthy
lifestyle, including a high prevalence of
cigarette smoking, less physical
activity, and a less healthy diet. Thus,
the true association between coffee
and diabetes risk might be stronger
than observed. Indeed, the similarity
found in the present adjusted and
unadjusted results indicates that the

association is unlikely to be
substantially confounded by known
diabetes risk factors. Nonetheless, it is
difﬁcult to establish the causality
between coffee consumption and
diabetes solely based on observational
evidence.

Because most of the studies coffee was
assessed through self-reported dietary
questionnaires, misclassiﬁcation of
coffee intake is inevitable. However, the
misclassiﬁcation is likely to be
nondifferential with respect to the
outcome because of the prospective
design of the studies, which might have
attenuated the observed association.
Only ﬁve studies addressed the loss to
follow-up percentage. However, the loss
to follow-up is unlikely to be associated
with coffee consumption and may have
resulted in selection bias. Coffee
brewing methods were not assessed in
the studies. However, most coffee is
likely to be ﬁltered coffee, and the
results from studies conducted in
various populations, including U.S.,
European, and Asian, were similar,
indicating consistency of the results
despite potentially different
preparation and processing methods. In
addition, none of the studies assessed
the amount of sugar and dairy added to
coffee. However, the amount of sugar
and dairy added to coffee is likely to be
small compared with other food
sources. Finally, because of the
observational nature of the studies, a
causal relationship cannot be
established with these data alone.

In conclusion, this meta-analysis
provides strong evidence that higher
consumption of coffee is associated
with a signiﬁcantly lower risk of
diabetes. Both caffeinated coffee and
decaffeinated coffee are associated
with reduced diabetes risk. Longer-term
randomized controlled trials are needed
to establish causality and to elucidate
the underlying mechanisms.
