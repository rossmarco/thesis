Aims:  Metabolic  syndrome  as  a  cardiovascular  disease  predictor,  is  proposed  to  be  reduced  by  following
a  Mediterranean  diet.  This  study  was  aimed  to  explore  the  relationships  between  metabolic  syndrome
and  Mediterranean  diet  in  type  2  diabetes  mellitus  patients.
Materials:  A  cross-sectional  study  was  performed  on  158  type  2  diabetes  mellitus  patients  28–75  years
old  (mean  age:  54.3    9.6  yrs).  Fasting  glucose  and  lipid  proﬁle  were  measured.  Blood  pressure  and
anthropometric  characteristics  of  each  participant  were  recorded.  Food  frequency  questionnaires  were
evaluated  using  an  11-item  score  to  determine  the  adherence  to  Mediterranean  diet.
Results:  Totally,  55.4%  of  participants  had  a  good  adherence  to  Mediterranean  diet.  The  risk  of  metabolic
syndrome  in  women  was  signiﬁcantly  higher  than  in  men  (OR  =  8.65,  CI  95%  =  2.88–25.99;  p  <  0.001).
Nuts,  legumes  and  seeds  consumption  were  associated  with  a  signiﬁcant  lower  risk  of  metabolic
syndrome  (OR  =  0.42,  CI  95%  =  0.188–0.917;  p  <  0.05).  No  considerable  association  was  observed
between  metabolic  syndrome  and  adherence  to  Mediterranean  diet  (p  =  0.167).
Conclusions:  Results  demonstrated  no  association  between  Mediterranean  diet  adherence  and
metabolic  syndrome  in  type  2  diabetes  mellitus  patients.  However,  nuts,  legumes  and  seeds  might
have  greater  beneﬁts  for  diabetics.

1.  Introduction

Type  2  diabetes  mellitus  (T2DM)  is  one  of  the  main  causes  of
cardiovascular  disease  (CVD)  [1]  and  one  of  the  key  components  of
metabolic  syndrome  (Met  S),  a  collection  of  cardiovascular  disease
risk  factors,  including  low  High  density  lipoprotein  cholesterol
(HDL-C),  elevated  triglycerides,  elevated  blood  pressure,  central
adiposity,  and  elevated  fasting  blood  glucose  [2].

CVD  is  responsible  for  about  one  third  of  all  deaths  among
diabetics  [3].  In  2010,  the  prevalence  of  Met  S  amongst  T2DM
patients  in  Ahvaz  was  estimated  73.1%  and  64.9%  according  to
National  Cholesterol  Education  Program  Adult  Treatment  Panel  III
(NCEP  ATP-III)  and  International  Diabetes  Federation  (IDF)  criteria,

respectively  [4].  This  indicates  an  alarming  situation  of  CVD
outcomes  in  the  near  future  that  requires  immediate  preventive
strategies.

According  to  a  systematic  review,  the  Mediterranean  diet  (MD)
was  the  most  likely  dietary  model  protecting  against  coronary
heart  disease  [5].  An  inverse  association  between  MD  scores  and
cardiovascular  and  neurodegenerative  diseases  and  some  types  of
cancer  has  been  suggested  [6,7].  Moreover,  it  seems  that  MD  has  a
favorable  effect  on  development  of  the  Met  S  [8].

MD  is  originated  from  the  traditional  diet  of  olive  growing
Mediterranean  region,  where  was  historically  among  the  lowest
chronic  disease  incidences  and  the  highest  life  expectancies  in  the
world  [9].  This  diet  consists  of  high  consumption  of  whole  grains,
legumes,  vegetables,  fruits  and  cereals,  nuts,  seeds  and  olive  oil  as
the  main  dietary  fat,  moderate  intake  of  ﬁsh  and  poultry,  up  to  four
eggs  in  a  week,  moderate  to  low  consumption  of  meat  and  dairy
products,  and  rarely  sweet  or  honey  consumption  [10].

Up  to  now,  few  studies  have  explored  the  beneﬁts  of  following
a  Mediterranean-type  diet  on  cardiovascular  health  of  T2DM

in 

frequently  evaluated 

patients.  A  recent  clinical  trial 
Italy  demonstrated  more
controlled  coronary  risk  factors  in  T2DM  patients  adhered  to
MD  in  comparison  to  a  low-fat  diet  [11].  MD  association  with  Met  S
has  been 
in  Mediterranean  population.
Although,  only  few  studies  have  assessed  this  relationship  in
non-Mediterranean  populations  [12–14],  especially  in  diabetics
[15–17].  This  was  the  ﬁrst  study  examined  the  association
between  metabolic  syndrome  prevalence  in  relation  to  following
the  Mediterranean  diet  in  a  group  of  Iranian  T2DM  patients.  It
would  expand  the  knowledge  on  applicability  of  this  dietary
pattern  to  control  CVD  risk  factors  in  this  population.

1.1.  Subjects

Participants  were  158  T2DM  outpatients  attending  to  Diabetes
Clinic  of  Golestan  Hospital,  Ahvaz,  Khuzestan  province,  Iran.  All
participants  provided  a  written  consent  form  before  participation.
The  study  was  approved  by  Ahvaz  Jundishapur  University  Research
Ethics  Committee  (Ethic  code:  IR.ajums.rec.1394.55).

2.  Materials  and  methods

Inclusion  criteria  were  included  previously  diagnosed  diabetes
by  a  general  practitioner  on  the  basis  of  the  ADA  (American
Diabetes  Association)  criteria  [18],  age  between  20  and  75  years,
and  being  treated  with  diet  or  oral  hypoglycemic  agents.  Insulin
therapy;  dietary  changes  within  the  last  three  months;  cardiovas-
cular  events  in  the  last  year;  having  cancer  or  any  serious  disease
were  considered  as  exclusion  criteria.

After  12  h  fasting,  5  mL  venous  blood  samples  were  collected
from  all  participants.  Samples  were  analyzed  for  fasting  blood
sugar  (FBS),  total  cholesterol,  HDL-C,  low  density  lipoprotein
cholesterol  (LDL-C)  and  triglycerides  (TG)  levels  using  standard-
ized  enzymatic  colorimetric  and  photometric  methods.  All
biochemical  analyses  were  performed  at  the  Central  Laboratory
of  Health  Research  Institute,  University  Diabetes  Research  Center.
Serum  Cholesterol,  TG,  FBS,  and  HDL-C  was  measured  by
enzymatic  methods  (Pars  Azmun  kits,  Pars  Azmun  Co.,  Karaj,  Iran)
using  auto-analyzer  (B.T.  3000,  Biotecnica  instruments,  Italy).
Friedewald  equation  was  used  to  calculate  LDL-C  levels  [19].

Data  on  age,  sex,  smoking  status,  physical  activity,  and
anthropometric  measures  was  recorded  for  each  participant.
Physical  activity  was  extracted  using  the  International  Physical
Activity  Questionnaire  as  MET-min/week  [20].  Anthropometric
measurements,  including  weight,  height,  body  fat  percentage  and
waist-circumference  (WC)  were  measured  by  a  trained  dietician.
Weight  and  body  fat  percentage  were  measured  with  minimal
cloth  without  shoes,  using  a  digital  scale  and  recorded  to  the
nearest  100  g  (Omron  212,  Omron  Corp.,  range  0.1–150  kg,
Germany).  Height  was  measured  using  a  tape  meter  without
shoes  and  recorded  to  the  nearest  0.1  cm.  Body  mass  index  (BMI)
was  calculated  as  weight  in  kg  divided  by  squared  height  in  meter
(kg/m2).  WC  was  measured  at  the  narrow  middle  part  between  the
lowest  rib  and  the  iliac  crest  over  light  clothing,  using  a  ﬂexible
tape  measure,  without  any  pressure  to  body  surface  and  was
recorded  to  the  nearest  0.1  cm.  Waist-height  ratio  (WHtR)  was
calculated  by  dividing  waist  in  meter  by  height  in  meter.

A  validated  86-item  food  frequency  questionnaire  (FFQ)  was
used  to  assess  usual  dietary  intake  of  the  participants  over  the  past
year.  USDA  (US  Department  of  Agriculture)  serving-sizes  or
household  measures  were  used  to  record  each  food  item.  The
FFQ  was  ﬁlled  by  a  trained  nutritionist.  Then  the  reported  portion-
size  was  converted  to  grams,  and  the  nutrients  and  energy  content
were  then  calculated  by  Nutritionist  IV  (N4)  software  (version  4.0;
N-squared  Computing,  Salem,  OR,  USA)  modiﬁed  according  to  the
Iranian  Food  Composition  Table  [21].  FFQs  were  scored  according

variables  were  compared  using  chi-squared  test  and  t-test  was  utilized
for  analyzing  quantitative 
independent  variables.  All  statistical
analyses  were  performed  using  SPSS  software  (version  21.0;  SPSS
Inc.,  Chicago,  IL,  USA).  Descriptive  statistics  were  used  for  participant
characteristics  across  the  scores  of  MD  adherence.  Patients  were
classiﬁed  into  two  groups  based  on  MD  scores  median:  equal  or  less
than  21  (as  low  adherent)  and  22  or  over  (as  high  adherent).  In  binary
logistic  regression,  MD  scores  were  deﬁned  as  the  exposure  and  Met  S
existence  as  dependent  variable.  Two-tailed  p-values  were  used  and
ﬁgures  less  than  0.05  were  determined  as  signiﬁcant.

3.  Results

Totally,  158  patients  entered  the  study.  After  energy  adjust-
ment  (mean    3SD),  one  participant  was  excluded  from  the  analysis,
then  the  ﬁnal  sample  was  157  T2DM  patients  (53  males  and
104  females)  aged  29–75  years.  The  prevalence  of  Met  S  in  total  study
population  was  84.1%  according  to  IDF  predeﬁned  criteria  (93.3%  in
men  and  66%  in  women).  More  than  half  of  participants  had  a  good
adherence  to  MD  pattern  (55.4%).

Two  groups  of  adherence  to  MD  (low  and  high)  were
examined  for  detecting  any  difference  in  Met  S  rate,  physical
activity,  biochemical  and  anthropometric  measures.  High
adherents  had  8.1%  lower  prevalence  of  Met  S  (p  =  0.17),  but
there  was  no  signiﬁcant  difference  between  the  study  groups
after  adjustment  for  energy,  macronutrient 
intake,  physical
activity,  age  and  sex  (88.6%  vs.  80.5%;  OR  =  1.67;  CI  =  0.61–476;
p  =  0.314)  (Table  1).

Systolic  and  diastolic  blood  pressures  were  not  different  based
on  MD  adherence  status.  High  adherents  had  more  energy  intake
than  low  adherents  (p  =  0.03)  (Table  1).

Logistic  regression  illustrated  higher  possibility  of  metabolic
syndrome  in  females  than  in  males  (OR  =  8.6;  CI  95%  =  2.87–25.99;
p  <  0.001).

Protein  (r  =  0.35)  and  ﬁber  (r  =  0.46)  intakes  were  signiﬁcantly
higher  in  high  adherents  (p  <  0.001  for  both)  (Table  1)  and  were
related  to  Met  S  (p  <  0.001  for  both  groups).

Participants  had  signiﬁcantly  different  consumption  of  MD
components  (p  <  0.05),  except  for  meat  (p  =  0.77)  and  egg  (p  =  0.63)
which  showed  a  similar  pattern  in  both  adherence  groups  (Table  2).
Logistic  regression  demonstrated  that  the  consumption  of  nuts,
legumes  and  seeds  was  different  in  the  Met  S  group  than  that  of  the
non-Met  S  group  (OR  =  0.415;  CI:  0.19–0.92;  p  =  0.03),  but  the
other  components  of  MD  did  not  show  any  signiﬁcant  variation.
Difference  in  sweets  intake  between  Met  S  and  non-Met  S  groups
was  near  signiﬁcant  (p  =  0.07)  (Table  3).

4.  Discussion

Previous  studies  have  found  possible  beneﬁcial  effects  of
following  MD  on  Met  S  and  CVD  risks  in  general  population.  Few
studies  have  suggested  the  beneﬁcial  effect  of  MD  on  some  CVD
risk  factors  in  T2DM  patients  [23–25].  Recently,  a  prospective
cohort  revealed  the  lower  rates  of  total  and  CVD  mortality  in
diabetic  subjects  following  the  traditional  MD  [26].

Current  study  demonstrated  no  association  between  MD  and
metabolic  syndrome  in  a  group  of  type  2  diabetics.  It  was  suggested
that  women  were  at  higher  risk  for  Met  S,  like  previous  ﬁnding  in
general  population  [27].  The  results  also  demonstrated  nuts,
legumes,  or  seeds  consumption  as  protective  items  against  CVD.
This  was  in  line  with  researches  identiﬁed  nuts  as  healthy  foods
against  Met  S  [25,28–30].  Having  some  MD  foods  far  from  original
MD  (e.g.  for  olive  oil,  meat  and  sweets),  consuming  inappropriate
food  items,  such  as  whole  fat  dairies,  high  glycemic  index  fruits  and
grain  products  containing  sugars  and  saturated  fats,  and  taking
excess  energy  may  be  responsible  for  showing  no  association  with
Met  S  in  the  present  study.  Elevated  energy  consumption  could
result  in  high  BMI  and  WC,  which  subsequently  could  increase
insulin  resistance  [31,32],  glucose  and  lipid  abnormalities  [33],  and
blood  pressure  [34],  all  the  components  of  Met  S.  Therefore,  when
recommending  MD,  it  is  important  to  make  a  correct  choice  from
each  food  group  and  to  consider  the  overall  energy  intake.  However,
MD  has  some  considerable  effects  on  cardiovascular  system,  such  as
high  antioxidant  capacity  that  lowers  the  inﬂammatory  reactions
[35],  high  ﬁbre  [36]  and  oleic  acid  content  [37]  which  promote
cardiovascular  health.  In  a  clinical  trial,  MD  also  declined  oxidative
damage  to  lipids  and  DNA  in  Met  S  individuals  [38].

Finally,  as 

the  observational  design  of 

Therefore,  nuts,  legumes  and  seeds  consumption  could  be
advised  by  clinicians  in  this  population.  Also,  diabetic  women
should  be  especially  targeted  for  metabolic  syndrome  treatment.
the  study,  more
investigations  should  be  performed  before  making  decision  about
MD  inclusion  in  current  dietary  recommendations  for  diabetics  in
our  population.  Further  well-designed  studies  especially  long  term
interventions  with  larger  sample  sizes  in  Iran  and  other  non-
Mediterranean  countries  are  highly  required  for  better  under-
standing  of  the  potential  health  beneﬁts  for  diabetic  patients  and
its  underlying  mechanisms.
