An increase in dietary protein improves the blood glucose response
in persons with type 2 diabetes1–3

Mary C Gannon, Frank Q Nuttall, Asad Saeed, Kelly Jordan, and Heidi Hoover

ABSTRACT
Background: In single-meal studies, dietary protein does not
result in an increase in glucose concentrations in persons with or
without type 2 diabetes, even though the resulting amino acids can
be used for gluconeogenesis.
Objective: The metabolic effects of a high-protein diet were com-
pared with those of the prototypical healthy (control) diet, which
is currently recommended by several scientific organizations.
Design: The metabolic effects of both diets, consumed for 5 wk
each (separated by a 2–5-wk washout period), were studied in 12
subjects with untreated type 2 diabetes. The ratio of protein to car-
bohydrate  to  fat  was  30:40:30  in  the  high-protein  diet  and
15:55:30 in the control diet. The subjects remained weight-stable
during the study.
Results: With the fasting glucose concentration used as a base-
line from which to determine the area under the curve, the high-
protein diet resulted in a 40% decrease in the mean 24-h integrated
glucose area response. Glycated hemoglobin decreased 0.8% and
0.3% after 5 wk of the high-protein and control diets, respectively;
the difference was significant (P < 0.05). The rate of change over
time was also significantly greater after the high-protein diet than
after the control diet (P < 0.001). Fasting triacylglycerol was
significantly lower after the high-protein diet than after the con-
trol diet. Insulin, C-peptide, and free fatty acid concentrations
were not significantly different after the 2 diets.
Conclusion: A high-protein diet lowers blood glucose postpran-
dially in persons with type 2 diabetes and improves overall glu-
cose control. However, longer-term studies are necessary to deter-
mine the total magnitude of response, possible adverse effects, and
the  long-term  acceptability  of  the  diet.

INTRODUCTION

When dietary recommendations for the general population or
for persons with diabetes are considered, the focus has been on
the relative amounts and types of carbohydrates and fat to include
in the diet (1–4). Both the type and amount of protein in the diet
has largely been ignored. Generally, protein has only been con-
sidered in the context of that necessary for maintenance of lean
body mass, ie, that needed to maintain nitrogen balance, whether
people have diabetes or not. A role for dietary protein in the

management of hyperglycemia either has not been considered or
has been considered only in regard to the amount of glucose that
theoretically can be derived from the constituent amino acids
through gluconeogenesis. However, as early as 1913 (5), it was
reported that the ingestion of egg white protein in a single-meal
study did not result in an increase in the blood glucose concen-
tration in healthy persons. Subsequently, data from several labo-
ratories  (6, 7;  reviewed  in  reference  8)—including  our  own
(9–13)—indicated that the peripheral glucose concentration does
not increase after protein ingestion in healthy persons or in per-
sons with type 2 diabetes. In persons with type 2 diabetes, protein
ingestion actually results in a small decrease in postprandial glu-
cose concentrations (8, 14). In a single-day study in which mixed
meals of various composition were fed to healthy young subjects,
the protein content of the meals was calculated to also lower the
blood glucose concentration (15). To our knowledge, the effect on
glucose metabolism of a high-protein, weight-maintenance diet
ingested over a longer period of time has not been reported. In the
present  study  we  tested  the  hypothesis  that  a  5-wk  period  of
increased dietary protein results in a lower plasma glucose con-
centration in persons with mild, untreated type 2 diabetes. The
responses of glucose, glycated hemoglobin, insulin, C-peptide,
glucagon, triacylglycerol, and nonesterified fatty acids to a high-
protein diet are included in this report.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS

Twelve subjects (10 men and 2 women) with mild, untreated
type 2 diabetes were studied in a Special Diagnostic and Treat-
ment Unit (SDTU), similar to a Clinical Research Center. All sub-
jects met the National Diabetes Data Group criteria for the diag-
nosis  of  type 2  diabetes  mellitus  (16).  The  mean  age  of  the

subjects was 61 y (range: 39–79 y), and the mean body mass
index (in kg/m2) was 31 (range: 22–37). The mean percent total
glycated  hemoglobin  was  8.0%  (range: 7.0–9.3%).  Written
informed consent was obtained from all subjects, and the study
was approved by the Department of Veterans Affairs Medical
Center and the University of Minnesota Committee on Human
Subjects. Subjects were screened and found not to have hemato-
logic abnormalities, liver disease, kidney disease, macroalbu-
minuria (> 300 mg/24 h), untreated thyroid disease, congestive
heart failure, angina, life-threatening malignancies, proliferative
retinopathy, diabetic neuropathy, peripheral vascular disease,
serious  psychological  disorders, or  a  body  weight  >  136 kg
(300 lb). All subjects were interviewed before the study began to
determine their physical activity profile and their food likes and
dislikes and to emphasize the commitment that they were about
to undertake. The subjects confirmed that they had been weight-
stable for ≥ 3 mo and they completed a 3-d food-frequency ques-
tionnaire covering the prior 2 wk; one of the days was a Satur-
day or Sunday. None of the subjects was being treated with oral
hypoglycemic agents or insulin.

The control (15% protein) diet was designed according to the
recommendations of the American Diabetes Association (2), the
American Heart Association (1), the US Department of Agri-
culture (4), and the American Cancer Society (3) at the time
(1997) that the study was conceived. The control diet consisted
of 55% carbohydrate (with an emphasis on starch-containing
foods), 15% protein, and 30% fat (10% monounsaturated, 10%
polyunsaturated, and 10% saturated fat). A second diet—the
high-protein diet—was designed to consist of 40% carbohy-
drate, 30% protein, and 30% fat (10% monounsaturated, 10%
polyunsaturated, and 10% saturated fat). Thus, the protein con-
tent of the diet was increased at the expense of carbohydrate.
The  fat  and  dietary  fiber  contents  of  the  diets  were  similar.
Examples of each diet are given in Table 1. The compositions
of the diets are given in Table 2.

Subjects were randomly assigned to begin the study with the
high-protein or the control diet, as determined by the flip of a coin.
The subjects were admitted to the SDTU on the evening before
the study began. On the following day, the subjects were fed stan-
dardized meals containing 55% carbohydrate, 30% fat, and 15%
protein. After the subjects had fasted overnight for 12 h, blood was
drawn for lipid studies.

On the second day in the STDU, standardized meals (55%
carbohydrate, 30% fat, and 15% protein) were again fed for
breakfast, lunch, and dinner at 0800, 1200, and 1800, respec-
tively. Snacks were given at 1400 (snack 1) and 2100 (snack 2).
Blood was obtained at 0730, 0745 and 0800; one-half hour after
each meal; and hourly throughout the remainder of the 24-h
period of the study, for a total of 46 time points. Subjects were
encouraged to drink water to ensure adequate urine output. After
this 24-h test period, the subjects were sent home with food for
the next 2–3 d, as appropriate for the diet to which they were
randomly assigned. All of the food to be eaten was supplied to
the subjects.

The subjects returned to the SDTU every 2–3 d to pick up food.
At that time, they provided a urine specimen (for measurement of
creatinine and urea to determine dietary compliance), were
weighed, and had their blood pressure and total percent glycated
hemoglobin measured. In addition, the subjects were interviewed
regarding dietary compliance and about any concerns that they had
about the study.

At the end of the 5-wk period, the subjects again were admit-
ted to the SDTU, and blood was drawn as described above. At this
time the control or high-protein diet (breakfast, lunch, dinner, and
2 snacks) was given, as appropriate. The distribution of calories
was as follows: 21% for breakfast, 27% for lunch, 13% for snack
1, 34% for dinner, and 5% for snack 2. The amount of carbohy-
drate in the meals and snacks for the control diet was ⬇82 g for
breakfast, 69 g for lunch, 36 g for snack 1, 79 g for dinner, and
33 g for snack 2; the respective amounts for the high-protein diet
were ⬇65, 49, 22, 67, and 20 g.

The plasma glucose concentration was determined with the use
of a glucose oxidase method (Beckman glucose analyzer with an
oxygen electrode; Beckman Instruments, Fullerton, CA). Total
glycated hemoglobin was measured by boronate affinity HPLC.
Serum immunoreactive insulin was measured with the use of a
standard double-antibody radioimmunoassay method with kits
produced by Incstar (Stillwater, MN). Glucagon was determined
with the use of a radioimmunoassay kit purchased from Linco
Research (St Louis). C-peptide was measured with the use of a
radioimmunoassay kit manufactured by Diasorin (Stillwater, MN).
Nonesterified fatty acids (NEFAs) were determined enzymatically
with the use of a kit manufactured by Wako Chemicals USA, Inc
(Richmond, VA). Creatinine, urea nitrogen, total cholesterol, HDL
cholesterol, and triacylglycerol were measured with the use of an
automated method on an Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics Vitros 950
analyzer (Raritan, NJ). LDL cholesterol was calculated with the
Friedewald formula. Microalbumin was determined by using a
Beckman-Coulter Array 360 analyzer. Weight was determined
with a digital scale (Scaletronix, White Plains, NY) while the sub-
jects were wearing street clothes and no shoes. Blood pressure was
determined  by  using  a  Dinamap  instrument  (Critikon/Mediq,
Pennsauken, NJ) with a digital readout.

The net 24-h area responses were calculated by using a com-
puter program based on the trapezoid rule (17). Statistics were
determined by using Student’s t test for paired variates with the
STATVIEW 512+ program (Brain Power, Calabasas, CA) for the
Macintosh computer (Apple Computer, Cupertino, CA). A P value
< 0.05 was the criterion for significance. Data are presented as
means ± SEMs.

RESULTS

The average body weight of the subjects was 96 kg (211 lb).
Body weight remained stable with both diets (Figure 1). The large
SEM was due to the variation between subjects. None of the sub-
jects lost or gained > 1 kg (2 lb) with either diet.

The ratios of urine urea to creatinine with the high-protein and
control diets were ⬇14 ± 1.3 and ⬇7 ± 0.7 at week 1 and remained
relatively stable throughout the 5-wk intervention period. In other
words, the ratio with the high-protein diet was double that with
the control diet, as would be expected with excellent compliance.
The mean fasting glucose concentration was not signiﬁcantly dif-
ferent after 5 wk of either diet, 6.3 ± 0.3 mmol/L, or 114 ± 6 mg/dL
(Figure 2). After ingestion of the control diet, the mean glucose
concentration increased to a peak of 11.4 ± 0.8 mmol/L (205 ±
14 mg/dL) after the breakfast meal, 8.4 ± 0.7 mmol/L (151 ±
13 mg/dL) after the lunch meal, 9.6 ± 0.6 mmol/L (172 ± 11 mg/dL)
after the dinner meal, and 9.5 ± 0.6 mmol/L (171 ± 11 mg/dL)
after snack 2. After ingestion of the high-protein diet, the mean
peak glucose concentration was 10.9 ± 0.7 mmol/L (196 ± 12 mg/dL)
after the breakfast meal, 7.9 ± 0.6 mmol/L (142 ± 10 mg/dL) after

ner meal, and 8.6 ± 0.3 mmol/L (154 ± 6 mg/dL) after snack 2.
Thus, the glucose concentration was consistently lower after the
high-protein diet, particularly in the evening.

The mean 24-h integrated glucose area responses, with the fast-
ing glucose concentration as baseline, were 34.1 ± 7.2 mmol · h/L

after the control and high-protein diets, respectively. The differ-
ence was statistically significant (P < 0.02).

The mean total percent glycated hemoglobin decreased from 8.0 ±
0.2% to 7.7 ± 0.3% after 5 wk of the control diet (Figure 3). After 5
wk of the high-protein diet, the total percent glycated hemoglo-
bin decreased from 8.1 ± 0.3% to 7.3 ± 0.2%. The decrease was
statistically significant after 4 and 5 wk of the high-protein diet

(P < 0.05) but not after the control diet. The rate of decline also
was significantly greater after the high-protein diet (P < 0.001),
which  was  determined  by  using  Student’s  paired t  test  of  the
decrement in slope over 5 wk.

The mean fasting serum insulin concentrations were 104 ±
18 pmol/L (17.3 ± 3.0 ␮U/mL) and 110 ± 21 pmol/L (18.4 ±
3.5 ␮U/mL) after the control and high-protein diets, respec-
tively (Figure 4). The insulin concentrations increased rap-
idly after the meals, as expected. The insulin excursion was
not significantly different with either diet after breakfast and
lunch but was modestly greater after dinner with the high-
protein diet.

The mean 24-h integrated insulin area response, with the fast-
ing  value  as  baseline, was  6720 ± 1710 pmol · h/L  (1120 ±
285 ␮U · h/mL) after the high-protein diet. After the high-protein

diet, the  insulin  area  response  was  7962 ± 1890 pmol · h/L
(1327 ± 315 ␮U · h/mL), or 18% greater than that after the con-
trol diet. This difference in area response was not statistically
significant (P = 0.25).

The  mean  fasting  C-peptide  concentration  was  0.27 ±
0.03 nmol/L (0.82 ± 0.08 pg/mL) after both the control and the
high-protein diets. The C-peptide response was similar to the
insulin response (Figure 5).

The mean 24-h integrated C-peptide area response was 5.5 ±
0.8 nmol · h/L (16.4 ± 2.4 pg · h/mL) with the control diet and
6.9 ± 1.0 nmol · h/L (20.7 ± 3 pg · h/mL) with the high-protein
diet, ie, 26% greater than that produced by the control diet.
This difference in area response was not statistically signifi-
cant (P = 0.07).

The mean fasting glucagon concentrations were not signifi-
cantly different after the control and high-protein diets: 78 ±

8.9 and 77 ± 10.5 ng/L (78 ± 8.9 and 77 ± 10.5 pg/mL), respec-
tively. The glucagon response was not significantly different
for the first 2 h after breakfast and lunch. However, from 1400
onward (6 h), the glucagon concentration was higher with the
high-protein  diet. After  dinner, the  glucagon  concentration
remained higher at all time points, until 0800 the next morn-
ing (Figure 6).

The mean 24-h integrated glucagon area response was 127 ±
63 and 525 ± 136 ng · h/L (127 ± 63 and 525 ± 136 pg · h/mL) as
a consequence of the control and high-protein diets, respectively,
which represented a 4-fold difference (P < 0.01).

The mean fasting NEFA concentrations were 623 ± 53 ␮mol/L
(623 ± 53 ␮Eq/L) and 659 ± 80 ␮mol/L (659 ± 80 ␮Eq/L)
after 5 wk of the control and high-protein diets, respectively

(Figure 7). After ingestion of the low-protein diet, the NEFA
concentration changed little for 30 min. The concentration
then decreased progressively for 3 h after breakfast. It sub-
sequently increased and reached a peak of 774 ± 132 ␮mol/L
(774 ± 132 ␮Eq/L) at 45 min after dinner, declined until 3 h
after dinner, and then increased again. The NEFA concen-
tration increased 30 min after breakfast with the high-protein
diet. Thereafter, the NEFA response to the high-protein diet
was not significantly different from the low-protein diet,
except that the peak was reached 30 min after breakfast
(736 ± 59 ␮mol/L, or 736 ± 59 ␮Eq/L), and the concentra-
tion at dinner was not significantly different from the fast-
ing concentration.

The mean 24-h integrated NEFA area response was ⫺2027 ±
1496 ␮mol · h/L (⫺2027 ± 1496 ␮Eq · h/L) after the control diet
(Figure 7). After the high-protein diet, the NEFA area response
was ⫺3008 ± 988 ␮mol · h/L (⫺3008 ± 988 ␮Eq · h/L), or a reduc-
tion of ⬇50% more than that after the control diet. There was con-
siderable  variability  between  subjects, and  the  differences  in
response were not statistically significant (P = 0.44).

The mean fasting triacylglycerol concentrations were 2.2 ±
0.2 mmol/L (199 ± 20 mg/dL) after 5 wk of the control diet and
1.8 ± 0.26 mmol/L (161 ± 23 mg/dL) after 5 wk of the high-
protein diet (Figure 8). The difference was statistically significant
(P < 0.03). After ingestion of either diet, the triacylglycerol con-
centration increased until ⬇1600, remained stable until ⬇2000,
and then increased again until 0200. It then decreased toward
baseline by 0800 the following morning.

after the control and high-protein diets, respectively. Thus,
although the fasting triacylglycerol concentration was lower after
the high-protein diet than after the control diet (P < 0.03), the
net triacylglycerol area response after meals was not signifi-
cantly different.

control and high-protein diets, respectively. HDL-cholesterol con-
centrations were 1.0 ± 0.08 and 1.0 ± 0.08 mmol/L (38 ± 3 and
39 ± 3 mg/dL), and LDL-cholesterol concentrations were 2.6 ±
0.3 and 2.6 ± 0.3 mmol/L (100 ± 12 and 101 ± 12 mg/dL) with the
control and high-protein diets, respectively. These differences
were not statistically significant.

The urinary creatinine clearance was 122 ± 11 and 113 ± 27
mL/min after 5 wk of the control and high-protein diets, respec-
tively. The urinary microalbumin value was 7.75 ± 1.71 mg after
5 wk of the control diet and 7.01 ± 0.81 mg after 5 wk of the
high-protein diet. None of these differences were statistically
significant.

The average blood pressure was 132 (systolic) and 74 (dias-
tolic) mm Hg before the 5 wk of the control and high-protein
diets and remained stable throughout the study (data not shown).

DISCUSSION

Several  years  ago  we  reported  that  protein, on  a  weight
basis, is  just  as  potent  as  is  glucose  in  stimulating  insulin
secretion in persons with type 2 diabetes (14). When protein
was given with glucose, a synergistic effect on insulin was
observed. As a result, the glucose area response was signifi-
cantly less after ingestion of protein plus glucose than after
ingestion of glucose alone. The insulin response was linearly
related to the amount of protein ingested. These data were
obtained by using very lean beef protein. Subsequently, we
reported that 7 different protein sources were effective in stim-
ulating an increase in circulating insulin concentrations in per-
sons  with  type 2  diabetes, although  they  varied  in  potency
(18). These highly significant insulin responses to different
proteins resulted in either no change or a modest decrease in
glucose concentration. This suggested that an increase in pro-
tein  content  in  the  diet—particularly  if  associated  with  a
decrease in carbohydrate content—would result in a decrease
in the integrated glucose concentration. Such a diet could be
useful for controlling blood glucose in persons with type 2
diabetes, provided it does not result in any adverse effects. The
present data indicate that an increase in dietary protein can
improve the 24-h integrated glucose concentration and result
in a significant decrease in glycated hemoglobin over a 5-wk
period. This time frame was chosen because it represents the
time required for glycated hemoglobin to decrease by 50% of
its  ultimate  value  (t1/2 =  33  d)  (19).  In  addition, with  the
method used to measure total glycated hemoglobin, each 1%
represents ⬇18 mg glucose/dL integrated over the life span of
a red blood cell (20). In the present study the decrease in total
glycated hemoglobin was 0.8%, or ⬇14.5 mg/dL glucose. Thus,
the final integrated glucose response would be expected to be
a decrease of ⬇29 mg/dL.

Doubling the protein content of the diet resulted in a doubling
of the urea-creatinine ratio by week 1. The ratio remained stable
over the 5 wk of the study. Thus, compliance was excellent. The
order in which the diets was given did not significantly affect the
results. Weight stability also was excellent (Figure 1). We consid-
ered this a critical aspect of the study design because our primary
goal was to determine the effect of the diet per se on total glycated
hemoglobin, without the confounding effect of weight loss (or
gain) or a reduced (or increased) food-energy intake. Blood
pressure also remained stable throughout the study. On the basis
of  weight  stability  and  dietary  compliance,
the  metabolic

changes that occurred after 5 wk of the high-protein diet were
considered to be attributed to the increase in protein or decrease
in carbohydrate content of the diet, or both, rather than other
confounding factors.

The mean fasting glucose concentration at the time the subjects
were recruited and enrolled in the study was 148 ± 8 mg/dL (8.2 ±
1 mmol/L) (total glycated hemoglobin = 8.1%). However, at the
beginning of the first 5-wk study period, the glucose concentra-
tion had decreased to 114 mg/dL, which is lower than ideal for a
study designed to show a decrease in glucose concentration. In
our experience, even though we asked the volunteers not to change
their diets or eating patterns before beginning the study, it is not
uncommon for subjects to report for study with a fasting glucose
concentration lower than when they were recruited (13, 21). The
reason  for  the  lower  concentration  is  unknown;  there  was  no
change in body weight. However, we suspect that subtle, uninten-
tional changes in diet or activity occur because of the increased
attention paid to the subject and his or her disease. This effect has
been referred to as the Hawthorn, or intervention, effect (22).
These changes indicate the need for all studies in which the sub-
jects have diabetes to be carefully controlled and not merely to be
observational in nature. The change in fasting glucose also repre-
sents a potential limitation in interpretation of the data obtained in
the present study.

The high-protein diet resulted in a glucose concentration that
was modestly lower after each of the meals. This was most appar-
ent  after  the  dinner  meal, at  which  time  both  the  insulin  and
glucagon concentrations were also greater. The net result was a
statistically significant decrease in the 24-h integrated glucose
area response, with the fasting value as baseline (Figure 2).

Glucose  excursion  was  lower  after  the  midday  meal, even
though the carbohydrate content of the lunch meals was only mod-
estly decreased (82 compared with 69 g for the control diet and
65 compared with 49 g for the high-protein diet). This indicates an
increase in insulin sensitivity with a second meal, which may rep-
resent the so-called Staub-Traugott phenomenon (23, 24).

The prelunch and predinner glucose concentrations were also
lower than the overnight fasting value; this finding was reported
previously in persons with type 2 diabetes (25–27). Lower mid-
day glucose concentrations also have been observed when per-
sons were fasting (28), but the decrease in concentration was
less in the persons without diabetes (29, 30). To our knowledge,
the reason for this circadian variation in glucose has not been
determined.

The postmeal insulin area responses were modestly but not sta-
tistically significantly increased with the high-protein diet. These
increases were less than we anticipated on the basis of single-meal
and single-day studies. The reason for this is unclear but it may have
been due to a corresponding decrease in carbohydrate in the diet.

The glucagon area response to the high-protein diet was robust,
ie, 4-fold  greater  than  with  the  control  diet, with  most  of  the
increase occurring later in the day (Figure 6). This finding is sim-
ilar to data obtained in healthy subjects (31). This highly significant
increase in glucagon would be expected to result in a stimulation
of gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis and a subsequent increase
in circulating plasma glucose concentrations. However, the glucose
response was less with the high-protein diet. This raises the issue
of the role of glucagon in the regulation of hepatic glucose pro-
duction, both after an overnight fast and after meals, as we pointed
out previously (13). Tachyphylaxis has been reported to occur dur-
ing a 45-min infusion of glucagon (32). Tachyphylaxis may explain

the lack of increase in glucose; however, it needs to be documented
by determining the endogenous glucose production rate. Note that
in a single-meal study, ingestion of 50 g beef protein resulted in
only a very modest increase in the glucose appearance rate, even
though the glucagon concentration increased briskly (13).

The 24-h NEFA profile was interesting. The NEFA concentra-
tion rapidly decreased after the breakfast meal and then gradually
increased throughout the day, with a sharp peak occurring after the
dinner meal. These increases occurred even though the insulin con-
centration was elevated over most of this time period. The reason for
this also is not clear and would appear to be paradoxical. Insulin is
known to lower the NEFA concentration in a very sensitive fashion
(33). The decrease in NEFA concentration could have been due to
hydrolysis of the ingested triacylglycerols by capillary bed lipopro-
tein lipase activity in response to the higher insulin concentrations
(34). If so, this phenomenon exceeded the known effect of insulin
to suppress triacylglycerol hydrolysis in fat cells and to stimulate
triacylglycerol synthesis and storage in the same cells (35).

It is also interesting that a transient increase in the NEFA con-
centration occurred after the high-protein breakfast meal. This
finding was observed previously in single-meal studies of the
ingestion of protein or protein plus glucose (10, 11, 13, 18, 36).
However, it has not been a consistent finding (9, 37), and the
mechanism is unknown.

Over the duration of the present study, no adverse effects were
noted. However, longer-term studies will be required to properly
investigate this issue.

The  creatinine  clearance  was  modestly  and  nonstatistically
signiﬁcantly decreased when the subjects ingested the high-protein
diet. An increase in dietary protein has been associated with an
increase in creatinine clearance in subjects with normal kidney
function. This has been reported in acute (38–42) as well as in
longer-term (5 d to 3 wk) studies (43–47); however, this is not a
consistent finding. In a population-based study (48) and in a 6-mo
outpatient study (49), an increased dietary protein intake was not
associated with an increase in creatinine clearance. It may be that
the kidney eventually adapts to an increase in dietary protein;
however, this possibility requires confirmation in long-term, con-
trolled, intervention studies.

Total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, and LDL-cholesterol con-
centrations were essentially unchanged with the high-protein diet.
However, the fasting triacylglycerol concentration decreased by
20% after 5 wk of the high-protein diet (Figure 8). This finding is
similar to the decrease reported in a 1-mo study of hyperlipidemic
people without diabetes who consumed a 27%-protein diet in
which 11% of total dietary energy from starch was replaced with
vegetable protein (50). These decreases in triacylglycerol were
likely due to decreases in dietary carbohydrate (51). Several stud-
ies reported an increase in triacylglycerol concentrations when
dietary fat is replaced with carbohydrate. However, the replace-
ment of fat with protein has been reported to not affect triacyl-
glycerol concentrations (see reference 51 for a review).

During the review process, it was requested that we reanalyze
the data to exclude the independent variables of age, body mass
index, total glycated hemoglobin, duration of diabetes, weight
change, and treatment with ␤ blockers or diuretics. None of these
independent variables had an effect on the total percent glycated
hemoglobin, glucose area, or fasting triacylglycerol concentration—
the primary outcome variables.

In summary, an increase in the protein content and a decrease
in the carbohydrate content of the diet for 5 wk resulted in an

improvement in the 24-h integrated net blood glucose area response
and a statistically significant decrease in glycated hemoglobin in
subjects with untreated type 2 diabetes. These improvements in glu-
cose control occurred without a change in body weight. In addition,
microalbumin and creatinine clearance, indicators of kidney func-
tion, were unchanged. Furthermore, the triacylglycerol concentra-
tion decreased, and the total cholesterol and HDL- and LDL-
cholesterol fractions were unchanged; however, these data must be
interpreted with caution because some subjects were taking med-
ications for lipid control. Overall, the data suggest that a high-pro-
tein diet may improve blood glucose control in persons with type 2
diabetes. Nevertheless, longer-term studies are necessary to deter-
mine potential adverse effects of such a diet, if any. The long-term
acceptability of such a diet should also be determined. Data for
plasma urea nitrogen, creatinine, ␣ amino nitrogen, uric acid,
growth hormone, and insulin-like growth factor I and for urinary
urea, aldosterone, and cortisol is published separately (52).
