Pekka Jousilahti, MD, PhDCENTURIES OF COFFEE DRINK-

ing has made it the most con-
sumed beverage in the world.
During the last decade, re-
search has attempted to make clear
health benefits or detriments received
from coffee drinking. Effects of coffee
and caffeine on cardiovascular dis-
ease,1 hypertension,2 neurological dis-
eases,3 different types of cancer,4 hor-
monal changes,5-7 gallstones,8 renal
stones,9 as well as diabetes mellitus
(DM)10-12 have been studied through
epidemiological, clinical, or experimen-
tal research. Type 2 DM is one of the
diseases that is largely determined by
lifestyle factors.13,14

The role of coffee in relation to DM
has not been investigated thoroughly. A
large Dutch cohort study12 recently
showed an inverse association between
coffee consumption and the risk of DM.
It is well known that caffeine stimu-
lates insulin secretion of the pancreatic
beta cells in vivo. However, coffee with
its complex compounds may influence
many other processes that may take part
in the development of DM.

According to international statis-
tics, the Finnish population has the

Context Only a few studies of coffee consumption and diabetes mellitus (DM) have
been reported, even though coffee is the most consumed beverage in the world.
Objective To determine the relationship between coffee consumption and the in-
cidence of type 2 DM among Finnish individuals, who have the highest coffee con-
sumption in the world.
Design, Setting, and Participants A prospective study from combined surveys
conducted in 1982, 1987, and 1992 of 6974 Finnish men and 7655 women aged 35
to 64 years without history of stroke, coronary heart disease, or DM at baseline, with
175682 person-years of follow-up. Coffee consumption and other study parameters
were determined at baseline using standardized measurements.
Main Outcome Measures Hazard ratios (HRs) for the incidence of type 2 DM were
estimated for different levels of daily coffee consumption.
Results During a mean follow-up of 12 years, there were 381 incident cases of type
2 DM. After adjustment for confounding factors (age, study year, body mass index,
systolic blood pressure, education, occupational, commuting and leisure-time physi-
cal activity, alcohol and tea consumption, and smoking), the HRs of DM associated
with the amount of coffee consumed daily (0-2, 3-4, 5-6, 7-9, ⱖ10 cups) were 1.00,
0.71 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.48-1.05), 0.39 (95% CI, 0.25-0.60), 0.39 (95%
CI, 0.20-0.74), and 0.21 (95% CI, 0.06-0.69) (P for trend⬍.001) in women, and 1.00,
0.73 (95% CI, 0.47-1.13), 0.70 (95% CI, 0.45-1.05), 0.67 (95% CI, 0.40-1.12), and
0.45 (95% CI, 0.25-0.81) (P for trend=.12) in men, respectively. In both sexes com-
bined, the multivariate-adjusted inverse association was significant (P for trend ⬍.001)
and persisted when stratified by younger and older than 50 years; smokers and never
smokers; healthy weight, overweight, and obese participants; alcohol drinker and non-
drinker; and participants drinking filtered and nonfiltered coffee.
Conclusion Coffee drinking has a graded inverse association with the risk of type 2
DM; however, the reasons for this risk reduction associated with coffee remain
unclear.

Therefore, research into potential health
effects of coffee in this population is of
particular interest. Our large prospec-
tive study aimed at determining
whether the suggested inverse relation-
ship between coffee and type 2 DM ex-
ists among the Finnish population. In

addition, we evaluated a possible effect
modification of the major determi-
nants of type 2 DM and assessed the ef-
fects of different types of prepared cof-
fee on the risk of DM.

METHODS
Participants
We performed baseline surveys in 2 east-
ern Finnish provinces, North Karelia and
Kuopio, and in the Turku-Loimaa re-
gion in southwestern Finland in 1982,
1987, and 1992. The survey was ex-
panded to the Helsinki capital area in
1992. In the 3 surveys, the sample in-
cluded participants aged 25 to 64 years.
The 1982, 1987, and 1992 cohorts were
combined in this analysis. The original
random sample was stratified by sex and
4 equally large 10-year age groups ac-
cording to the World Health Organiza-
tion MONItoring trends and determi-
nants of CArdiovascular disease
(MONICA) protocol16,17 and consisted of
21630 participants. The participation
rate varied by year from 74% to 88%.18
Our analysis included 16670 partici-
pants aged 35 to 64 years due to the few
cases of type 2 DM in participants aged
25 to 34 years during the follow-up. The
final sample comprised 6974 men and
7655 women after excluding partici-
pants diagnosed with coronary heart dis-
ease or stroke (n=590), participants with
known DM at baseline (n=435), and par-
ticipants with incomplete data on any
variables required for this analysis
(n=1016). We excluded participants
with coronary heart disease and stroke
because there may be bias regarding their
exposure (coffee drinking due to their
disease) or confounding factors (diet and
physical activity, their survival probabil-
ity is lower, and they may be using drugs
that trigger DM). These surveys were
conducted according to the ethical rules
of the National Public Health Institute
and the investigations were performed
in accordance with the Declaration of
Helsinki. At the time the baseline sur-
veys were performed, oral informed con-
sent was obtained from the participants
and if not received, the survey data were
not collected from these participants
(they were considered nonresponders).

Measurements
A self-administered questionnaire was
sent to the participants to be com-
pleted at home. The questionnaire in-
cluded questions on medical history, so-
cioeconomic factors, physical activity,
smoking habits, and alcohol, coffee, and
tea consumption. Education level, mea-
sured as the total number of school
years, was divided into birth cohort spe-
cific tertiles. Physical activity in-
cluded occupational, commuting, and
leisure-time physical activity. A de-
tailed description of the questions is
presented elsewhere,19 and these ques-
tions were the same as those used in the
studies in the Nordic countries19,20 and
similar to those used and validated in
the Seven Countries study.21

The participants reported their occu-
pational physical activity as light, mod-
erate, or active. The daily commuting
journey to or from work was grouped
into 3 categories: using motorized trans-
portation or not working outside the
home (0 minutes of walking or cy-
cling); walking or bicycling 1 to 29 min-
utes; and walking or bicycling 30 or more
minutes. Self-reported leisure-time physi-
cal activity was classified as low, mod-
erate, or high. Based on the responses,
the participants were classified as never,
ex-smokers, or current smokers. Cur-
rent smokers were categorized into those
participants who smoked less than 20 or
20 or more cigarettes per day.

The participants were asked, “How
many cups of coffee or tea do you drink
per day?” Coffee consumption was cat-
egorized into 5 categories: 0 to 2 cups,
3 to 4 cups, 5 to 6 cups, 7 to 9 cups,
and 10 or more cups. Tea consump-
tion was categorized as none, 1 to 2
cups, and 3 or more cups because only
a few people drank tea. Alcohol con-
sumption was categorized as none, 1 to
100, 101 to 300, or more than 300 g of
alcohol per week. Because only a few
women drank more than 300 g of al-
cohol per week, we combined the 2
higher categories in women.

At the study site, specially trained
nurses measured height, weight, and
blood pressure using the standardized
protocol according to the World Health

Organization MONICA project.17 Blood
pressure was measured from the right
arm of the participant who was seated
for 5 minutes before the measurement
was taken using a standard sphygmo-
manometer. Body mass index (BMI)
was calculated as weight in kilograms
divided by the square of height in me-
ters. In stratified analyses, the partici-
pants were classified in 3 categories:
normal weight (BMI ⬍25.0), over-
weight (25 to ⬍30), and obese (ⱖ30).

Diagnosis of DM
We ascertained incident cases of DM
from the National Hospital Discharge
Register and the Drug Register of the Na-
tional Social Insurance Institution. These
register data were linked to the risk fac-
tor survey data with the unique per-
sonal identification numbers assigned to
every resident of Finland. Antidiabetic
drugs prescribed by a physician are free
of charge in Finland subject to ap-
proval of the application to the Na-
tional Social Insurance Institution with
a case history prepared by the treating
physician attached. The physician con-
firms the diagnosis of DM on the basis
of the World Health Organization crite-
ria after 198022; before 1980, Finnish na-
tional guidelines were applied. All pa-
tients receiving free-of-charge medication
(either oral antidiabetic agents or insu-
lin) are entered into a register main-
tained by the National Social Insurance
Institution. The National Hospital Dis-
charge Register includes hospitaliza-
tions for patients admitted to hospitals
with a primary or secondary diagnosis
of DM in Finland nationwide. Fol-
low-up of each participant in our pre-
sent analysis continued until December
31, 1998, or until death.

Statistical Analyses
Sex-specific differences in risk factors
based on different levels of coffee con-
sumption were tested using univariate
analysis of variance or logistic regres-
sion after adjustment for age and study
year. The association between coffee
consumption at baseline and the risk
of type 2 DM was analyzed by using
Cox proportional hazards regression

models. Different levels of coffee con-
sumption were included in the mod-
els as dummy variables. All analyses
were adjusted for age, study year, BMI,
systolic blood pressure, education, oc-
cupational, commuting, and leisure-
time physical activity, alcohol and tea
drinking, and smoking. The signifi-
cance of the trend over different cat-
egories of coffee consumption was
tested in the same models by giving an
ordinal numeric value for each dummy
variable. To assess whether the effect
differed between the sexes, first-level in-

teractions between coffee consump-
tion and sex were analyzed. Because no
statistically significant interactions were
found, men and women were com-
bined in subgroup analyses adjusted for
sex. Statistical significance was consid-
ered to be P⬍.05. All statistical analy-
ses were performed with SPSS version
11.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, Ill).

RESULTS
A total of 381 cases of type 2 DM were
identified during a mean follow-up of 12
years. In general, older persons were less

likely to drink coffee (TABLE 1). After ad-
justment for age and study year, higher
coffee consumption was associated with
higher BMI and cigarette smoking, and
lower blood pressure, education level,
light occupational physical activity, lei-
sure-time physical activity, tea consump-
tion, and alcohol use.

1.00, 0.72 (95% confidence interval [CI],
0.49-1.04), 0.49 (95% CI, 0.32-0.73),
0.47 (95% CI, 0.25-0.87), and 0.26 (95%
CI, 0.08-0.85; P for trend = .002) in
women, and 1.00, 0.83 (95% CI,

0.86 (95% CI, 0.53-1.39), and 0.69 (95%
CI, 0.40-1.19; P for trend=.74) in men,
respectively (TABLE 2). After further ad-
justment for BMI, systolic blood pres-
sure, education, occupational, commut-
ing, and leisure-time physical activity,
alcohol and tea consumption, and smok-
ing, this inverse association remained
highly significant among women (P for
trend⬍.001). In men, a similar trend was
observed and the risk of DM was signifi-
cantly reduced in those participants who
drank at least 10 cups of coffee (HR, 0.45;
95% CI, 0.25-0.81). When data for men
and women were combined, sex-
adjusted and multivariate-adjusted HRs
were 1.00, 0.76 (95% CI, 0.57-1.01), 0.54
(95% CI, 0.40-0.73), 0.55 (95% CI,
0.37-0.81), and 0.39 (95% CI, 0.24-
0.64; P for trend⬍.001), respectively.

The risk of DM did not differ be-
tween total coffee abstainers and light
coffee drinkers (HR, 1.20; 95% CI,
0.74-1.97). Sex-adjusted and multivar-
iate-adjusted (including coffee consump-
tion) HRs of DM by tea consumption of
0, 1 to 2, 3 or more cups were 1.00, 0.81
(95% CI, 0.63-1.05), and 0.98 (95% CI,
0.67-1.42; P for trend = .27), respec-
tively. To avoid the potential bias from
subclinical disease, additional analyses
were also performed excluding cases of
type 2 DM, which occurred during the
first 4 years of follow-up (n=27). The
sex-adjusted and multivariate-
adjusted HRs by coffee consumption of
0 to 2, 3 to 4, 5 to 6, 7 to 9, and 10 or
more cups did not vary and were 1.00,
0.74 (95% CI, 0.55-1.00), 0.54 (95% CI,
0.39-0.74), 0.54 (95% CI, 0.36-0.81),
and 0.41 (95% CI, 0.25-0.68; P for
trend⬍.001).

Coffee Consumption and Risk of
Type 2 DM in Subgroup Analyses
Multivariate-adjusted inverse associa-
tion between coffee consumption and

DM risk was present in participants aged
35 to 49 years (P for trend=.23) and 50
to 64 years (P for trend=.001; TABLE 3).
Similarly, the inverse association was ob-
served in nonsmokers (P for
trend = .001), in overweight partici-
pants (P for trend=.01), and in non-
drinkers (P for trend ⬍.001). A nonsig-
nificant association was observed in
smokers (P for trend=.07), in healthy
weight participants (P for trend=.35),
in participants who were obese (P for
trend=.05), in alcohol drinkers (P for
trend=.25), in filtered coffee drinkers (P
for trend=.07), and in pot-boiled cof-
fee drinkers (P for trend=.06). There
were 22 incident cases of DM among
participants aged 25 to 34 years at base-
line who were not included in the analy-
ses. An additional analysis including the
youngest age group also did not change
the results.

The type of coffee consumption was
assessed in the surveys from 1987 and
1992. More than 80% of Finnish cof-
fee consumers used filtered coffee at
baseline. There was no interaction be-

1= 2.63, 0.85, and 2.13 for men,
women, and for men and women com-
bined, respectively; all P⬎.10). Men and
women who drank pot-boiled coffee
without filtering showed a similar in-
verse trend in risk of type 2 DM vs par-
ticipants who drank filtered coffee
(Table 3). However, men who drank
pot-boiled coffee showed a 2.9 times
higher risk for development of DM (HR,

2.86; 95% CI, 1.76-4.63) compared with
men who drank filtered coffee after
multivariate adjustment for risk fac-
tors of DM, including the amount of
coffee consumed (TABLE 4). This as-
sociation was also observed among men
and women combined.

COMMENT
This study revealed unequivocal evi-
dence for an inverse and graded asso-
ciation between coffee consumption

and type 2 DM independent of other
risk factors for type 2 DM. Because the
Finnish population drinks more cof-
fee than other populations,15 we had
power to determine the risk of DM at
high levels of coffee consumption. The
significant inverse association be-
tween coffee consumption and the risk
of type 2 DM was found in both sexes.
In a previous study among the Finn-
ish population,23 no association be-
tween the coffee consumption and in-

cidence of type 2 DM was observed.
One possible explanation for the dif-
ferent results is that at the time of their
baseline survey, in 1973 and 1977, most
Finnish individuals drank pot-boiled
coffee. At the end of the 1960s, 75% of
the Finnish population drank boiled
coffee24 but by 1987 this proportion had
decreased to 24%, although 69% drank
filtered coffee.25 However, although we
were able to determine the type of the
coffee consumed in our surveys in 1987
and 1992, there was no interaction
effect between type of coffee and
amount of coffee on the risk of type 2
DM in either men or women. Never-
theless, there was a significant, almost
3-fold, increase in the risk of diabetes
among men who drank pot-boiled cof-
fee compared with men who drank fil-
tered coffee.

Van Dam and Feskens12 investi-
gated the association between coffee
consumption and risk of type 2 DM in
a prospective study. They also ob-
tained similar inverse associations be-
tween coffee consumption and the risk
of type 2 DM, similar to our results. Re-
cently, data from large US cohorts of
men and women also showed that long-
term coffee consumption and total caf-
feine intake were significantly associ-
ated with a reduced risk of type 2 DM.26
A Japanese cross-sectional study com-
prising 1916 men and 2704 women
aged 40 to 50 years found that coffee
intake or caffeine intake from coffee was
inversely associated with the preva-
lence of fasting hyperglycemia (fast-
ing plasma glucose, ⱖ110 mg/dL [ⱖ6.1
mmol/L]).27

Although the biological mechanism
behind the inverse association be-
tween coffee consumption and the risk
of DM is unknown, several putative
mechanisms can be proposed. The pro-
tective effect of coffee may be due to the
inhibition of glucose-6-phosphatase ac-
tivity by chlorogenic acid.28 Hepatic glu-
cose-6-phosphatase may be a key con-
trol site in the homeostatic regulation
of blood glucose concentration,29,30 and
glucose-6-phosphatase is widely held
to be a significant factor in the abnor-
mally high rates of hepatic glucose pro-

duction observed in the diabetic state.
Reduced glucose-6-phosphatase hy-
drolysis or its inhibition may reduce
plasma glucose output leading to re-
duced plasma glucose concentra-
tion.28 Hypoglycemic effect of chloro-
genic acid has been presented in
streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats as
well.31 Johnston et al32 also suggest that
chlorogenic acid might have an antago-
nistic effect on glucose transport. It is
possible that habitual differences be-
tween the coffee consumers and differ-
ent manufacturing process of coffee
from green seeds may also result in dif-
ferent effects. For instance, roasting and
some other manipulation of process-
ing coffee will partly destroy chloro-
genic acid and may oxidize some other
compounds to form new compounds,33
leading subsequently to differential
metabolic effects.

In addition to the inhibitory effects
of chlorogenic acid on glucose-6-
phosphatase affecting glucose regula-
tion at hepatic stage, it has also been
reported to inhibit glucose transport-
ers (sodium-dependent glucose trans-
porter) at the intestinal stage.34 Coffee
may also influence the secretion of gas-
trointestinal peptides such as glucagon-
like peptide 1 and gastric inhibitory
polypeptide, both of which are known
for their glucose lowering effects.35,36
Coffee also contains magnesium, ap-
proximately 11 mg per 100 g of dry cof-
fee. This component is another pos-
sible factor, which may result in positive
effects on glucose tolerance and pre-
vention of type 2 DM. There is a sig-
nificant inverse correlation between se-
rum magnesium and the incidence of
type 2 DM; both serum and ionized
magnesium were consistently found to
be decreased in patients with DM.37-40
It is well known that caffeine and the-
ophylline are strong stimulants of pan-
creatic beta cells.41 Stimulation of insu-
lin secretion may be beneficial in people
at risk of type 2 DM who usually have
impaired insulin secretion.11 In addi-
tion, caffeine may increase insulin sen-
sitivity.42 It has also been suggested that
the thermogenic effect of caffeine may
overcome the energy imbalance accom-

panied by unfavorable lifestyle and im-
prove glucose homoeostasis.

The inverse association between cof-
fee consumption and the risk of DM
tended to be stronger in women than
in men, although the sex-interaction
was not statistically significant. Previ-
ous studies have revealed that caffeine
may be positively associated with
plasma estrogen, plasma estradiol, and
sex hormone-binding globulin levels
and inversely related with testoster-
one among postmenopausal wom-
en.5,6 In addition phytoestrogens may
have beneficial effects in patients with
DM. Phytoestrogens content of coffee
and effects of caffeine on hormonal level
may explain the effects of coffee on the
risk of diabetes in women. Neverthe-
less, in most populations, the preva-
lence of type 2 DM is lower in women
than in men at premenopausal age.43,44
A limitation of our study was that a
glucose tolerance test was not per-
formed in the baseline and follow-up
surveys. Therefore, we could have
missed some cases of asymptomatic and
diet-treated diabetes, although the clini-
cal diagnosis of diabetes from the hos-
pital discharge register may have in part
avoided this potential underdiagno-
sis. Another source of misclassifica-
tion may be that we used self-report for
data on coffee intake. However, the mis-
classification of exposure is most prob-
ably not systematically related to the
outcome and vice versa. Therefore, it
should not cause biased results but may
only weaken the observed associa-
tion. Finally, we cannot completely ex-
clude the effects of residual confound-
ing due to measurement error in the
assessment of confounding factors and
unmeasured factors such as diet (whole
grain consumption, intake of fiber, satu-
rated and polyunsaturated fat, glyce-
mic load of the diet, and total energy
intake). The Finnish population typi-
cally drink their coffee without milk or
only add a very small volume of milk.
In conclusion, we found a strong and
graded inverse relationship between
coffee consumption and the risk of type
2 DM among Finnish men and women,
a population with the highest coffee

nisms or process by which coffee con-
tents may exert their beneficial effects
on DM are nevertheless unclear. Sev-
eral components of coffee may affect
glucose regulation, such as chloro-
genic acid on glucose-6-phosphatase,
antioxidant activity of polyphenols on
␣-glucosidase, caffeine on insulin se-
cretion on pancreatic beta cells, cumu-
lative effects of phytoestrogens, and
magnesium, which are suggested as the
