Egg intake and type 2 diabetes 

Objective: While limited and inconsistent findings have been reported on the relation between 
dietary cholesterol or egg consumption and fasting glucose, no previous study has examined the 
association between egg consumption and type 2 diabetes. This project sought to examine the 
relation between egg intake and the risk of type 2 diabetes in two large prospective cohorts.  
 
Research Design and Methods: Prospective design using data from two completed randomized 
trials: 20,703 men from the Physicians’ Health Study I (1982-2007) and 36,295 women from the 
Women’s Health Study (1992-2007). Egg consumption was ascertained using questionnaires and 
we used Cox proportional hazard model to estimate relative risks of type 2 diabetes.  
 
Results: During mean follow up of 20.0 years in men and 11.7 years in women, 1,921 men and 
2,112  women  developed  type  2  diabetes.  Compared  with  no  egg  consumption,  multivariable 
adjusted hazard ratios (95% CI) for type 2 diabetes were 1.09 (0.87-1.37), 1.09 (0.88-1.34), 1.18 
(0.95-1.45), 1.46 (1.14-1.86), and 1.58 (1.25-2.01) for consumption of <1, 1, 2-4, 5-6, and 7+ 
eggs/week, respectively, in men (p for trend <0.0001). Corresponding multivariable hazard ratios 
(95% CI) for women were 1.06 (0.92-1.22), 0.97 (0.83-1.12), 1.19 (1.03-1.38), 1.18 (0.88-1.58), 
and 1.77 (1.28-2.43), respectively (p for trend <0.0001).  
 
Conclusions: These data suggest that high levels of egg consumption (daily) are associated with 
an increased risk of type 2 diabetes in men and women. Confirmation of these findings in other 
populations is warranted.

is  highly 
prevalent and is associated with 
high  health  care  costs  and 
societal burden1. Therefore, it is important to 
identify modifiable risk factors that may help 
reduce  the  risk  of  type  2  diabetes.  Eggs  are 
not only major sources of dietary cholesterol 
(~200  mg/egg)  but  also  contains  other 
important  nutrients 
as  minerals, 
vitamins, proteins, carotenoids, and saturated 
(~1.5  g/egg),  polyunsaturated  (~0.7  g/egg), 
and  monounsaturated 
fatty 
acids2,3. While several of these nutrients have 
been associated with an increased risk of type 
2 
and 
cholesterol4,5),  other  nutrients  may  confer  a 
lower 
(i.e. 
polyunsaturated fat4).  
 
While  egg  consumption  was  not 
associated with coronary heart disease (CHD) 
or stroke overall, Hu et al.6 reported a 2-fold 
increased risk of CHD for egg consumption of 
>1/week among men with type 2 diabetes in

However,  it  is  not  known  whether  egg

diabetes  itself.  In  animal  experiments,  a  diet

from positive associations  2,12 to no effects12-

To our knowledge, no previous study 
has  examined  the  association  between  egg 
consumption  and  the  incidence  of  type  2 
diabetes in a large prospective cohort of men 
and women. Because eggs can serve as a good 
source  for  vitamins,  proteins,  and  other 
in 
nutrients 
to 
determine 
the  net  benefit/harm  of  egg 
consumption  on  the  risk  of  type  2  diabetes. 
The  current  study  examines  the  association 
between egg consumption and incident type 2 
diabetes  among  men  and  women  who 
participated 
completed 
two 
randomized control trials. 
 
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: 
 
Study population: We used data from 
the Physicians’ Health Study (PHS) I and the 
Women’s  Health  Study 
two 
completed 
double-blind, 
randomized, 
placebo-controlled trials designed to study the 
effects of aspirin and beta carotene (PHS) or 
low-dose aspirin and vitamin E (WHS) in the 
prevention  of  cardiovascular  disease  and 
cancer. Detailed description of the PHS I and 
WHS  has  been  published  previously16-18. 
Briefly, a total of 22,071 US male physicians 
aged 40 years and older at entry (1982) were 
randomized  using  a  2x2  factorial  design  to 
aspirin  (325  mg  every  other  day),  beta-
carotene  (50  mg  every  other  day),  or  their 
corresponding  placebos.  Similarly,  39,876 
female health professionals aged 45 years and 
older  at  entry  (1992-1995)  were  randomized 
to  low-dose  aspirin  (100  mg  on  alternate

The correlation between egg consumption and 
dietary  cholesterol  was  0.61  (p<0.0001),  and 
0.26  (p<0.0001)  for  saturated  fat  among 
women. 
 
Ascertainment  of  incident  type  2 
diabetes: Type 2 diabetes was ascertained by 
self-report on annual follow-up questionnaires 
in  both  men  and  women.  Follow-up  and 
ascertainment  of  type  2  diabetes  cases  was 
completed  in  March  2007.  Because  all  men 
were  physicians,  self-report  was  deemed 
sufficient.  Among 
health 
professionals,  self-reports  of  type  2  diabetes 
were  validated  using  American  Diabetes 
Association  criteria,  by  obtaining  additional 
information 
interview, 
supplemental  questionnaire,  or  review  of 
medical records from treating physicians21,22. 
Overall, the positive predictive value for type 
2 diabetes validation was 91%21. 
 
Other  variables:  Demographic  data 
were  collected  at  baseline.  In  addition, 
information  on  prevalence  of  hypertension, 
hypercholesterolemia, 
family  history  of 
diabetes (WHS only), smoking, exercise, and 
alcohol 
at 
baseline.  While  limited  data  on  foods  were 
available in men, detailed dietary information 
was  collected 
the  WHS,  allowing 
estimation of energy intake and nutrients. 
 
Statistical  analyses:  We  classified 
each subject into one the following categories 
of  egg  consumption:  0,  <  1  per  week,  1  per 
week,  2-4  per  week,  5-6  per  week,  and  7+ 
eggs per week. We computed person-time of 
follow  up  from  baseline  until 
the  first 
occurrence of a) type 2 diabetes, b) death, or 
c)  censoring  date,  the  date  of  receipt  of  the 
last  follow-up  questionnaire  (March  2007). 
Within  each  egg  consumption  group,  we 
calculated 
type  2 
diabetes  by  dividing  the  number  of  cases  by 
the corresponding person-time. We used Cox 
proportional  hazard  models

participant gave written informed consent and 
the  Institutional  Review  Board  at  Brigham 
and  Women’s  Hospital  approved  both  study 
protocols.  For 
the  present  analyses,  we 
excluded 1,368 men because of prevalent type 
2  diabetes  (n=641);  missing  data  on  egg 
consumption 
(n=365)  or  on  potential 
confounders:  smoking,  alcohol  intake,  body

and  vegetables  (n=362).  Among  women,  we

and

of  20,703  men  and  36,295  women  was  used 
in current analyses.  
 
Egg  consumption:  Among  men, 
information  on  egg  consumption  was  self-
reported 
simple 
abbreviated  semi-quantitative  food  frequency 
questionnaire.  Participants  were  asked 
to 
report how often, on average, they had eaten 
one  egg  during 
the  past  year.  Possible 
response  categories  included  “rarely/never”, 
“1-3/month”,  “1/week”,  “2-4/week”,  “5-
6/week”, 
“2+/day”.  This 
information was obtained at baseline, 24, 48, 
72,  96,  and  120  months  after  randomization. 
Among  women, 
egg 
consumption  was  self-reported  using  a  131-
item validated food frequency questionnaire19 
at baseline. Women were asked to report their 
average consumption of one egg over the past 
response  categories  were

“Never  or  <1/month”, 
“1-3/month”, 
“1/week”,  “2-4/week”,  “5-6/week”,  “1/day”, 
“2-3/day”, “4-5/day”, and “6+/day”. Because 
very  few  subjects  consumed  1+  eggs/day 
(7.8%  for  men  and  1.0%  for  women),  we 
combined categories of 1 per day and beyond 
for  stable  estimates.  The  validity  of  food

with  less  than  2  years  of  follow  up.  We 
repeated the main analysis using updated egg 
consumption  at  24,  48,  72,  96,  and  120 
months  in  a  time-dependent  Cox  model  in 
men  only,  where  repeated  measures  on  egg 
consumption were available. Lastly, we used 
generalized  linear  model  and  polytomous 
logistic  regression  to  impute  missing  values 
for  continuous  and  categorical  variables, 
respectively.  All  analyses  were  completed 
using  SAS,  version  9.1  (SAS  Institute,  NC). 
Significance level was set at 0.05.  
Results 
The  mean  age  at  randomization  was 
 
53.5±9.4  years  (range  39.7  to  85.9  years)  in 
the PHS I and 54.5±7.0 years (range 38.7 to 
89.9  years) 
the  WHS.  Among  egg 
consumers, the median egg consumption was 
about 1 per week in men and women. Table 1 
presents  baseline  characteristics  of  the  study 
participants.  Frequent  consumption  of  eggs 
was associated with higher body mass index, 
higher proportion of current smoking, higher 
lower 
prevalence  of  hypertension,  and 
prevalence 
In 
addition,  frequent  consumption  of  eggs  was 
associated  with  older  age  and  more  alcohol 
consumption in men and higher energy intake, 
as well as intakes of saturated and trans fatty 
acids, and dietary cholesterol in women. 
 
A  total  of  1,921  new  cases  of  type  2 
diabetes  were  documented  in  men  during  a 
mean  follow  up  of  20.0  years.  Among 
women,  2,112  new  cases  of  type  2  diabetes 
occurred  during  a  mean  follow  up  of  11.7 
years. From the lowest to the highest category 
of egg consumption, crude incidence rates of 
diabetes were 35.8, 41.3, 42.7, 46.8, 62.4, and 
67.0 cases/10,000 person-years in the PHS I. 
Similar increased rate of type 2 diabetes with 
egg  consumption  was  observed  in  women 
with  corresponding  crude  incidence  rates  of 
39.6,  45.8,  43.3,  64.8,  76.8,  and  112.7

In  a  secondary  analysis  stratified  by

either  gender  in  subjects  with  and  without 
hypercholesterolemia  (p  for  interaction  0.37

differential physiologic effects of eggs in lean 
vs.  overweight/obese  subjects.  However,  the 
lack  of  repeated  data  on  fasting  glucose  in 
men  and  women 
the  present  study 
prevented  us  to  further  explore  the  relation 
between  adiposity,  egg  consumption,  and 
fasting glucose.  
 
Overall, the observed increased risk of 
type  2  diabetes  with  daily  consumption  of 
eggs in the current study raises the possibility 
of  undesirable  health  effects  with 
large 
quantity  of  egg  consumption  and  may  help 
explain  previously  reported  increased  risk  of 
CHD  that  was  restricted  to  individuals  with 
type  2  diabetes  in  the  Health  Professional 
Follow-up Study6, the Nurses’ Health Study6, 
and in our earlier publication from the PHS I 
showing  an  increased  risk  of  mortality  (and 
suggestive increased risk of CHD and stroke) 
with 
frequent  egg  consumption  among 
subjects with prevalent type 2 diabetes 7. It is 
possible  that  frequent  egg  consumption  may 
potentiate  the  risk  of  cardiovascular  disease 
by inducing impaired glucose metabolism and 
insulin  resistance.  Future  investigations  to 
explore  underlying  physiologic  mechanisms 
are warranted. 
 
Besides  dietary  cholesterol,  eggs 
contain  other  important  nutrients  that  have 
been shown to increase (i.e. saturated fat and 
cholesterol4,5,25) 
(i.e. 
polyunsaturated  fat4)  the  risk  of  type  2 
diabetes.  It  is  possible  that  the  individual 
contribution  from  each  of  these  components 
derived not just from eggs but also from other 
foods may play a role in determining the net 
effect  of  egg  consumption.  Unfortunately,  as 
noted above, we did not have repeated data on 
fasting  glucose,  fasting  insulin,  and  other 
biomarkers  of  glucose  metabolism  in  either 
cohort  to  comprehensively  examine  possible 
physiologic  mechanisms  by  which  egg 
consumption might influence the risk of type 
2 diabetes in our cohort. However, in women

Furthermore, 
Adamopoulos  and  colleagues  demonstrated 
that a diet enriched with egg yolk resulted in 
elevated  plasma  glucose  compared  with  a 
control diet in male Wistar albino rats9. Data 
from  the  Zutphen  Study10  showed  a  positive 
association  between  egg  consumption  or 
dietary cholesterol and fasting glucose. These 
animal  studies  and  data  from  the  Zutphen 
Study10  are  consistent  with  our  findings.  In 
contrast, 
trial  of  28 
overweight/obese  subjects  on  a  carbohydrate 
restricted  diet,  consumption  of  3  eggs/d  has 
no effects on fasting glucose compared to no 
egg  consumption11.  Since 
the  positive 
associations  described  above  were  observed 
in  studies  without  restricted  consumption  of 
the 
carbohydrates, 
hyperglycemic 
egg 
consumption might only occur with a diet rich 
in  carbohydrates.  However,  our  secondary 
data  analysis  provided  no  evidence  for  such 
that  we  observed  similar 
hypothesis 
increased  risk  of 
type  2  diabetes  with 
consumption of one or more eggs per day in 
women with low or high energy intake from 
carbohydrate.  Further  restriction  to  women 
with body mass index of at least 25 kg/m2 to 
mimic the above trial of 28 overweight/obese 
subjects  on  restricted  carbohydrate  diet11  did 
not  alter  these  findings.  Under  the  premise 
that  our  observed  findings  are  driven  by 
dietary  cholesterol  contained  in  eggs,  one 
possible  explanation  for  the  inconsistency  in 
reported data on the association between egg 
consumption  and  glucose  metabolism  could 
be the large variability of individual response 
to  dietary  cholesterol14,15,23.  While  dietary 
cholesterol  has  been  shown 
increase 
plasma  cholesterol  in  hyperresponders2,12,24, 
no 
among  
hyporesponders12-14.  Second,  the  lack  of  an 
effect of egg consumption on fasting glucose 
among obese/overweight subjects in the only 

effect  was

using 

American 

in a validation study of  self-reported type 2 
diabetes 
Diabetes 
Association  criteria,  by  telephone  interview, 
supplemental  questionnaire,  or  review  of 
medical  records  from  treating  physicians21. 
Moreover,  egg  consumption  was  collected 
prior  to  the  diagnosis  of  diabetes;  thus,  it  is 
likely  that  any  misclassification  of  diabetes 
would be non-differential and bias the results 
towards  the  null.  Nevertheless,  the  large 
sample size, the long duration of follow ups, 
the  repeated  and  standardized  methods  for 
data collection in both cohorts, the robustness 
of  the  findings  in  sensitivity  analyses  are 
major strengths of this paper.  
 
In  conclusion,  our  data  are  consistent 
with  possible  detrimental  effects  of  daily 
consumption  of  eggs  on  the  risk  of  type  2 
diabetes  in  both  men  and  women.  Since  the 
median  egg  consumption  in  this  population 
(1/week  for  men  and  women)  falls  within  a 
range not associated with an increased risk of 
type 2 diabetes, a dietary advice to reduce egg 
consumption  may 
individuals  who 
consume  one  or  more  eggs  per  day  if  these 
findings are confirmed in other studies. Given 
type  2  diabetes, 
the  societal  burden  of 
confirmation  of 
in  other 
populations  and  exploration  of  possible 
underlying 
are 
warranted.

there was attenuation of the association upon 
additional  adjustment  for  dietary  cholesterol. 
This  suggests 
that  the  observed  relation 
between  egg  intake  and  diabetes  may  be 
partially explained by the cholesterol content 
of  eggs.  In  contrast,  saturated  fat  was  not 
associated  with 
and 
adjustment  for  this  did  not  attenuate  the 
results. 
 
Additional  limitations  of  the  present 
study  include  the  observational  nature  of  the 
study design in which residual confounding or 
unmeasured  confounding  could  partly  or 
completely  explain  our  results.  In  addition, 
since egg consumption was self-reported, we 
cannot  exclude  reporting  bias  in  the  present 
study.  However,  because  information  on  egg 
consumption  was  collected  prior 
the 
occurrence of type 2 diabetes, such reporting 
bias is more likely to be non-differential and 
thus bias the results towards the null. We did 
not

participants  consumed  egg  yolk  (rich  in 
cholesterol) 
the 
contribution  of  dietary  cholesterol  from  eggs 
on  type  2  diabetes  risk  in  this  study.  In 
addition,  we  had  limited  dietary  data  in  men 
to  further  assess  the  interplay  between  eggs 
and other foods, energy, and nutrients on the 
risk of type 2 diabetes. The generalizablity of 
our finding is limited as both PHS I and WHS 
consist  of  homogeneous  groups 
(male 
physicians  and  female  health  professionals, 
respectively)  with  the  possibility  that  their 
behaviors  may  differ  from  those  of  the 
general population. Furthermore, over 90% of 
the study participants were Caucasians. Given 
the  self-report  nature  of  type  2  diabetes,  we 
can  not  exclude  misclassification  of 
the 
outcome in these data, especially in the WHS 
where not all participants were physicians as 
was  the  case  in  the  PHS.  However,  in  the 
WHS, we had a 91% positive predictive value
