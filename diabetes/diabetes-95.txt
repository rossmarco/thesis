Abstract

We examined associations between fruit and vegetable intake and the incidence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) in a population-

based prospective study of 64,191 women with no history of T2D or other chronic diseases at study recruitment and with

valid dietary information. Dietary intake was assessed by in-person interviews using a validated FFQ. During 297,755

person-years of follow-up, 1608 new cases of T2D were documented. We used a Cox regression model to evaluate the

association of fruit and vegetable intake (g/d) with the risk of T2D. Quintiles of vegetable intake and T2D were inversely

associated. The relative risk for T2D for the upper quintile relative to the lower quintile of vegetable intake was 0.72

(95%CI: 0.61–0.85; P , 0.01) in multivariate analysis. Individual vegetable groups were all inversely and signiﬁcantly

associated with the risk of T2D. Fruit intake was not associated with the incidence of diabetes in this population. Our data

suggest that vegetable consumption may protect against the development of T2D. J. Nutr. 138: 574–580, 2008.

Introduction

Fruits and vegetables may play a protective role in the develop-
ment of type 2 diabetes (T2D),6 as they are rich in nutrients and
other components that are believed to be protective against dia-
betes, such as antioxidants (1) and ﬁber (2). Fruits and vegetables
also contain numerous other beneﬁcial phytochemicals, many of
which are not documented in nutrient databases.

Data regarding the associations between fruit and vegetable
intake and the risk of T2D are limited and inconsistent (3) and
some studies were not properly adjusted for potential con-
founders (4–6). This is a problem because fruit and vegetable
consumption may act as a marker for a healthy lifestyle. To our
knowledge, only 3 studies have evaluated associations between
speciﬁc subgroups of vegetables and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c)
and T2D incidence (3,7,8).

Asian populations traditionally have a lower risk of T2D and
obesity than Western populations. However, that appears to be
changing. The prevalence of both obesity and T2D have been
increasing in Asian populations in recent years (9). In the base-
line survey of the Shanghai Women’s Health Study (SWHS) (10)
conducted between 1997 and 2000, we found that the prevalence
of T2D was 5.7%, the prevalence of BMI $ 23 kg/m2 was
59.1%, and that of BMI $ 25kg/m2 was 35.2% (our un-
published data). Change in dietary patterns is also taking place

intake and decreased
vegetable intake (11). Higher vegetable intake has been associ-
ated with less weight gain (12,13), a strong predictor for T2D, in
Western populations. However, the association of vegetable
intake with T2D risk in Chinese populations has not been well
studied (14).

We evaluated the association of fruit and vegetable intake lev-
els with the incidence of T2D in a large, population-based pro-
spective study of middle-aged women conducted in Shanghai,
China, where consumption of vegetables, especially leafy green
vegetables, is high. We explored whether speciﬁc subgroups of
vegetables differentially affect T2D risk and we evaluated the
potential interactions of fruit and vegetable intake with obesity
and physical activity categories.

Methods

Study population. The SWHS is a population-based prospective cohort
study of middle-aged women (40–70 y old) conducted in 7 urban com-
munities in Shanghai, China. Details of the SWHS survey have been
reported elsewhere (10). From a total of 81,170 women who were invited
to participate, 75,221 were recruited (92.7% participation rate). Reasons
for nonparticipation were refusal (3.0%), absence during the enrollment
period (2.6%), and other reasons such as health, hearing, and speaking
problems (1.6%). After excluding women ,40 y or .70 y at the time of
interview (n ¼ 278), 74,942 women remained for the study. Participants
completed a detailed survey, including a personal interview for assessment
of dietary intake, physical activity, and measurement of anthropometrics
and other lifestyle factors. Protocols for the SWHS were approved by the
Institutional Review Boards of all institutes involved in the study and all
participants provided written, informed consent. A biannual, personal
follow-up for all living cohort members was conducted via in-home visits
from 2000 to 2002 and from 2002 to 2004, with a response rate of 99.8

and 98.7%, respectively; only 934 participants were lost to follow-up. A
total of 64,227 participants were free of T2D and other chronic diseases
(cancer and cardiovascular disease) at baseline and they form the basis of
this report.

Fruit and vegetable intake. Usual dietary intake was assessed through a
personal interview using a validated FFQ at the baseline recruitment
survey and again at the ﬁrst follow-up survey (15). If women had a history
of T2D, cancer, or cardiovascular disease reported between the baseline
and follow-up surveys, we used dietary data from the baseline FFQ in the
analysis. For other participants, we used the mean of the baseline and
follow-up FFQ data. The means of the daily intake of individual food
items (g/d) were summed to compute total fruit and vegetable intake. Soy
beans, dried beans, and other legumes were not included as vegetables
and were evaluated in a separate report. We created speciﬁc vegetable
groups, including cruciferous vegetables, green leafy vegetables, yellow
vegetables, tomatoes, allium vegetables, and other vegetables and fruit
groups, including citrus, watermelon, and other fruits. (see Appendix).
We used the Chinese Food Composition Tables (16) to estimate energy
intake (kJ/d) and nutrient intakes. Of 64,227 participants who were free
of T2D and other chronic diseases at baseline, we excluded participants
who had extreme values for total energy intake (,2090 or .14,630 kJ/d;
n ¼ 36) (17), which left 64,191 participants for the ﬁnal analysis.

Other factors as potential confounders. All anthropometric mea-
surements, including weight, height, and circumferences of waist and
hips, were taken at baseline recruitment according to a standard protocol
by trained interviewers who were retired medical professionals (18).
From these measurements, the following variables were created: BMI,
weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters and waist-
to-hip ratio (WHR), waist circumference divided by hip circumference.
A detailed assessment of physical activity was conducted using a
validated questionnaire (19). The questionnaire evaluated regular exer-
cise and sports participation during the last 5 y, daily activity, and the daily
round-trip commute to work. We calculated the metabolic equivalents
(MET) for each activity using a compendium of physical activity values
(20). One MET (h/d) is roughly equivalent to 4.18 kJkg21d21 or ;15
min of moderate intensity (4 MET) activity for an average adult (20). We
combined each of the exercise and lifestyle activity indices to derive a
quantitative estimate of overall nonoccupational activity (MET-h/d).
Occupation-related physical activity was not related to T2D in this pop-
ulation and thus was not included in the current analysis.

Information on sociodemographic factors such as age, level of edu-
cation (none, elementary school, middle/high school, college), family
income in yuan/y (,10,000, 10,000–19,999, 20,000–29,999, $30,000),
occupation (professional, clerical, manual worker/other, housewife/retired),
smoking (smoked at least 1 cigarette per day for .6 mo continuously),
and alcohol consumption (ever drank beer, wine, or spirits at least 3 times
per week), and presence of hypertension at baseline was collected by using
a structured questionnaire.

Outcome ascertainment. Incident T2D was identiﬁed through the
follow-up surveys by asking study participants whether they had been
diagnosed by a physician as having diabetes since the baseline recruit-
ment and asking about their glucose test history and/or use of hypo-
glycemic medication. A total of 1608 study participants reported having
a T2D diagnosis since the baseline survey. We considered a case of T2D
as conﬁrmed if a participant reported having been diagnosed with T2D
and met at least 1 of the following criteria as recommended by the
American Diabetes Association (21): fasting glucose level $7 mmol/L on
at least 2 separate occasions; an oral glucose tolerance test with a value
$11.1 mmol/L; and/or use of hypoglycemic medication (i.e. insulin or
oral hypoglycemic drugs). Of the 1608 self-reported cases, a total of 896
participants met the study outcome criteria and are referred to herein as
conﬁrmed cases of T2D. We performed analyses with both conﬁrmed
and probable T2D cases and found similar results.

Statistical analysis. Person-years of follow-up for each participant were
calculated as the interval between the baseline recruitment to the diag-
nosis of T2D censored at death or completion of the second follow-up

survey. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to assess the asso-
ciation of fruit and vegetable intake with the incidence of T2D. Food groups
(g/d) were categorized by quintile distribution, with the lowest quintile
serving as the reference. Tests for trend were performed by entering the
categorical variables as continuous parameters in the models. Sociodemo-
graphic factors and T2D risk factors were adjusted for in the analyses as
potential confounders. In all models, we adjusted for the following poten-
tial confounding variables: age, BMI, WHR, total energy, meat intake (all
entered as continuous variables), as well as income level, education level,
occupation, physical activity, smoking status, alcohol consumption status,
and presence of hypertension at baseline (as categorical variables).

We conducted analyses stratiﬁed by BMI, WHR, and physical ac-
tivity categories. The log-likelihood ratio test was used to evaluate mul-
tiplicative interactions between fruit and vegetable intake and categories
of BMI, WHR, and physical activity.

We also conducted analyses adjusting for antioxidants (vitamin C,
carotene, and vitamin E) and ﬁber. To reduce measurement error and to
adjust for extraneous variation due to total energy intake, we adjusted
these nutrients by total energy intake using the residual method de-
scribed by Willett and Stampfer (22).

All analyses were performed using SAS (version 9.1) and all tests of

statistical signiﬁcance were based on 2-sided probability.

Results

The median intake of fruits was 239.4 g/d and 236.0 g/d for
vegetables. Age-standardized characteristics of the study popu-
lation by fruit and vegetable intake are shown in Table 1. A
higher intake of fruit was associated with younger age, higher
physical activity, higher educational achievement, being em-
ployed, and higher household income. Participants with a higher
fruit intake were more likely to have high BMI and less likely to
be smokers. A higher vegetable intake was associated with
younger age, higher physical activity, higher BMI, higher WHR,
presence of hypertension, and nonsmoking status. Of the par-
ticipants in the highest quintile of vegetable intake who were free
of chronic disease at baseline, the percentage with a BMI $
23 kg/m2 was 56.7%, a BMI $ 25 kg/m2 was 32.64%, and BMI $
27.5 kg/m2 was 13.10%.

During 4.6 y of follow-up (297,755 person-years total), 1608
incident cases of T2D were documented. Vegetable intake was
associated with a decreased risk of T2D. Compared with the
lowest quintile of intake, the multivariate adjusted relative risks
(RR) of T2D across quintiles of vegetable intake were 1.00,
0.74, 0.68, 0.72, and 0.72 (P-trend , 0.001) (Table 2). Because
participants with hypertension might have increased their fruit
and vegetable intake following their diagnoses, we conducted
analyses stratiﬁed by hypertension status (yes/no) and found
similar results. The RR for quintiles of total vegetable intake for
hypertensive participants were 1.00, 0.81, 0.65, 0.72, and 0.75
(P , 0.001) and 1.00, 0.70, 0.71, 0.72, and 0.70 (P , 0.001) for
nonhypertensive participants. We also examined the association
between deciles of vegetable intake and the incidence of T2D.
The RR for deciles of vegetable intake were 1.00, 0.87, 0.68,
0.72, 0.61, 0.66, 0.67, 0.68, 0.64, and 0.71 (P , 0.001).

There were inverse associations across quintiles of intake of
cruciferous vegetables, green leafy vegetables, yellow vegetables,
allium vegetables, tomatoes, and other vegetables. Although trend
tests were signiﬁcant, some of these inverse associations did not
follow a linear dose-response relationship. We did not ﬁnd an
association between fruit intake and the risk of T2D in this pop-
ulation. Compared with the lowest quintile of intake, the multi-
variate adjusted RR of T2D across quintiles of fruit were 1.00,
0.76, 0.79, 0.87, and 1.05 (P-trend 0.30). Similarly, we did not
ﬁnd a signiﬁcant association between individual fruit groups and
the risk of T2D. The RR associated with quintiles of consumption

of citrus fruits were 1.00, 0.84, 0.84, 0.81, and 1.11 (P ¼ 0.36),
1.00, 0.84, 0.83, 0.90, and 1.04 (P ¼ 0.47) for watermelon, and
1.00, 0.77, 0.68, 0.85, and 0.90 (P ¼ 0.28) for other fruits.

In analyses restricted to conﬁrmed diabetes cases, we found
similar results (Table 3). We excluded participants who had been
diagnosed with T2D during the ﬁrst year of follow-up. The
adjusted RR for T2D across quintiles relative to the lowest
quintile were 1.00, 0.76, 0.68, 0.69, and 0.68 (P , 0.001) for
vegetables and 1.00, 0.81, 0.83, 0.88, and 1.08 (P ¼ 0.31) for
fruit.

We assessed potential effect modiﬁcation by BMI (,25 or
$25) and WHR (,0.85 and .0.85) and physical activity levels
(using the lower 25% quartile as the cut-off point of the MET
distribution) with fruit and vegetable intake (Table 4). BMI,
WHR, or physical activity did not modify the association be-
tween fruit and vegetable intake and T2D.

We further explored whether the effect of fruit and vegetables in
the development of T2D could be explained by antioxidants, ﬁber,
and magnesium. We added each nutrient in the model one at a time
and in combination to examine whether the primary association
with fruit or vegetable intake could be explained by nutrient

intake. The inverse association between vegetable intake and T2D
became slightly accentuated when the model included vitamin C,
carotene, and ﬁber, or all antioxidants, magnesium, and ﬁber
together. The RR of T2D across quintiles of vegetable intake were
1.00, 0.71, 0.63, 0.63, and 0.56 (P-trend ,0.001) in the analysis
adjusted for ﬁber, magnesium, and all antioxidants. We observed a
modest increase in risk of T2D in participants in the highest
quintile of fruit intake after adjustment for vitamin C, carotene,
ﬁber, and magnesium, and all antioxidants, magnesium, and ﬁber
together. The RR for the highest quintile compared with the lowest
quintile for T2D in fully adjusted analysis was 1.21 (95%CI: 0.99–
1.49). It is noteworthy that some of the nutrients were highly
correlated with vegetable and fruit intake. Colinearity may have
limited our ability to sort out the factors responsible for the vege-
table and diabetes association.

aged Chinese women, higher intake of vegetables was associated

with a reduced risk of T2D. Fruit intake and T2D risk were not
associated.

Our study adds to the limited and conﬂicting data available on
fruit and vegetable intake and the risk of T2D. An inverse
association between vegetable, but not fruit, intake and glucose
intolerance has been found in cross-sectional (6) and prospective
studies (3,4,23) similar to our study. Inverse associations between
both fruit and vegetable intake and the risk of glucose intolerance
(5,8,24) and HbA1c (7) have been also been reported. However,
other studies have found no association between fruit and/or

vegetable intake and T2D risk (5,14,25–27) or levels of HBA1c
(28). In a randomized control trial among 577 participants with
impaired glucose tolerance conducted in China, a diet high in
fruits and vegetables appeared to reduce the incidence of T2D by
24% (29). A diet high in fruit and vegetables was also associated
with a higher insulin sensitivity in the Dietary Approaches to Stop
Hypertension intervention trial (30).

Few studies have looked at individual vegetable groups and
the risk of T2D. Yellow and dark-green vegetable intake has
been associated with lower HbA1c levels and T2D incidence

(3,7). In a middle-aged Finnish population, green vegetables but
not yellow/red vegetables were associated with a lower incidence
of T2D (8). In the Women’s Health Study, BMI appeared to be an
effect modiﬁer on the association between green or dark-yellow
vegetable intake and T2D (3). In our study, both green and
yellow vegetable intakes were inversely associated with T2D.
We found that neither BMI nor WHR modiﬁed the effect of
vegetable intake on risk of T2D.

Several studies investigating the association between fruit and
vegetable intake were based on cross-sectional surveys and ad-
justed for a limited number of confounders. For example, in the
Seven Countries study, an inverse relationship between vegetable

intake and 2-h glucose concentration in an oral glucose tolerance
test was found, but the analyses were adjusted for only cohort,
age, BMI, and energy intake (4). In a cross-sectional study of a
Canadian native population, a protective effect of vegetables on
impaired glucose tolerance or T2D was reported (OR ¼ 0.41;
95%CI: 0.18–0.91) (5). This analysis, however, was adjusted for
only age and sex. Another cross-sectional study in the UK found a
decreased risk of T2D associated with salad and raw vegetable
consumption (OR ¼ 0.16; 95%CI: 0.04–0.81) with adjustment
for age, sex, and family history of T2D (6). When BMI was ad-
justed for, the association was attenuated. None of these studies
adjusted for smoking habits, physical activity, or meat intake.

The mechanism by which vegetables affect glucose tolerance
has not been clearly deﬁned but may be associated with the high
content of antioxidants, (1) ﬁber (2), and magnesium (31) or the
low glycemic index in vegetables (32). Chronic administration of
vitamin E has been reported to improve insulin sensitivity (33)
and vitamin C was associated with higher insulin action in both
healthy and diabetic people (34). However, in the Health Profes-
sionals Follow-Up Study, there was no association with the inci-
dence of T2D after 12 y of supplementation with b-carotene (35).
In our study, the inverse association between vegetable intake and
T2D persisted after adjustment for vitamin C, vitamin E, carotene,
and ﬁber intake. Further adjustment for magnesium intake did
not alter the association. Taking this evidence into consideration,
it appears that the beneﬁcial effects of vegetable consumption on
the risk of T2D cannot be entirely explained by antioxidant vi-
tamins, magnesium, or ﬁber intake. Vegetables also contain other
compounds such as phytates, lignans, and isoﬂavones that might
have an additive or synergistic effect on lowering the risk of T2D.
Our data suggest that fruit consumption is not associated with
a lower risk of T2D in this population. Other studies have found
similar results (3,6,23,27). We do not have a ready explanation as
to why fruit was not associated with a lower risk of T2D in our
study population. We speculate that the high fructose content of
fruit may counteract the protective effect of antioxidants, ﬁber,
and other antidiabetic compounds of fruit. It has been suggested
that sugars containing fructose may play a major role in the
development of hypertension, obesity, diabetes, the metabolic
syndrome, and in the subsequent development of kidney disease
(36). However, high serum uric acid concentrations, which have
been associated with the metabolic syndrome (37), were not
found to be related to fruit juice intake in a recent study using
NHANES data (38). More research is needed to investigate the
association between fructose in fruit and health outcomes.

Several alternative explanations should be considered when
interpreting our ﬁndings. First, the exact beneﬁt of fruit and
vegetable intake is very difﬁcult to assess when multiple factors
such as exercise, not smoking, and maintaining a healthy weight
may also be contributing a beneﬁcial effect (the healthy lifestyle
bias) and protecting participants from developing T2D. Fruit and
vegetable consumption may act as a marker for a healthy lifestyle
and healthy dietary pattern in general (6,39). This is a potential
problem in many observational studies of diet and disease and it is
difﬁcult to exclude. However, in China, dietary patterns are quite
different from Western societies. Vegetables are widely consumed
in Shanghai and less correlated with socio-economic status. Fruit
intake, on the other hand, is associated with higher socioeco-
nomic factors in this population. Although we adjusted for
education and income in the analysis, residual confounding
remains a possible concern for our results, together with potential
unmeasured confounders.

Participants in the SWHS are a representative sample of the
Chinese, middle-aged female population in Shanghai. The pro-
spective design, high participation rate, and high follow-up rates
minimized the possibility of selection or recall bias. The repeated
dietary measurements improved the quality of the dietary infor-
mation and the extensive information available allowed us to
adjust for a wide range of potentially confounding variables. An
important limitation of our study is reliance on self-reports of
T2D. Analyses restricted to participants whose diagnosis of T2D
was conﬁrmed according to our study criteria showed inverse
associations between vegetable intake and the incidence of T2D.
Recall of dietary intake is subject to misclassiﬁcation. This kind of
nondifferential misclassiﬁcation would tend to weaken associa-
tions between fruit and vegetable intake and T2D. The pre-

diagnostic or preclinical manifestations of T2D might have lead
to changes in diet. After we excluded probable cases of T2D and
participants diagnosed within the ﬁrst year of follow-up, our
analyses showed a clearer linear association of vegetable intake
with T2D than analyses that included the total population.
Further follow-up of the cohort would provide a more deﬁnite
assessment of the vegetable and T2D association.

Our study adds to the limited and conﬂicting data of the
associations between fruit and vegetable intake and the risk of
T2D. A higher intake of vegetables, rich in ﬁber, antioxidants, and
magnesium and with a low glycemic index, was associated with a
decreased risk of T2D.
