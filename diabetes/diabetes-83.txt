abstract

background
The effects of a carbohydrate-restricted diet on weight loss and risk factors for athero-
sclerosis have been incompletely assessed.

methods
We randomly assigned 132 severely obese subjects (including 77 blacks and 23 wom-
en) with a mean body-mass index of 43 and a high prevalence of diabetes (39 percent)
or the metabolic syndrome (43 percent) to a carbohydrate-restricted (low-carbohydrate)
diet or a calorie- and fat-restricted (low-fat) diet.

results
Seventy-nine subjects completed the six-month study. An analysis including all sub-
jects, with the last observation carried forward for those who dropped out, showed that
subjects on the low-carbohydrate diet lost more weight than those on the low-fat diet

lost (P<0.001) and assignment to the low-carbohydrate diet (P=0.01) were independ-
ent predictors of improvement in triglyceride levels and insulin sensitivity.

conclusions
Severely obese subjects with a high prevalence of diabetes or the metabolic syndrome
lost more weight during six months on a carbohydrate-restricted diet than on a calorie-
and fat-restricted diet, with a relative improvement in insulin sensitivity and triglyceride
levels, even after adjustment for the amount of weight lost. This finding should be in-
terpreted with caution, given the small magnitude of overall and between-group differ-
ences in weight loss in these markedly obese subjects and the short duration of the
study. Future studies evaluating long-term cardiovascular outcomes are needed before
a carbohydrate-restricted diet can be endorsed.

and a calorie- and fat-restricted diet are
of considerable public interest. However, there is
concern that a carbohydrate-restricted diet will ad-

with a high prevalence of diabetes or the metabolic

hydrate) diet than on a calorie- and fat-restricted

methods

subjects
The study was approved by the institutional review
board at the Philadelphia Veterans Affairs Medical
Center, and an approved consent form was signed
by each subject. Inclusion criteria were an age of at
least 18 years and a body-mass index (the weight in
kilograms  divided  by  the  square  of  the  height  in
meters) of at least 35. Exclusion criteria were a se-
rum creatinine level of more than 1.5 mg per decili-
ter (132.6 µmol per liter); hepatic disease; severe,
life-limiting medical illness; inability of diabetic
subjects to monitor their own glucose levels; active
participation in a dietary program; or use of weight-
loss medications. During an enrollment period that
lasted from May to November 2001, 132 subjects
from the Philadelphia Veterans Affairs Medical Cen-
ter were randomly assigned to either the low-car-
bohydrate diet or the low-fat diet, with use of a pre-
established algorithm generated from a random set
of numbers. We used stratified randomization, with
blocking  within  strata,  to  ensure  that  each  group
would contain approximately equal numbers of
women, subjects with diabetes, and severely obese
subjects (body-mass index, 40 or higher). The study
was not blinded.

study design
The two diet groups attended separate two-hour
group-teaching sessions each week for four weeks,

followed  by  monthly  one-hour  sessions  for  five
additional months; all sessions were led by experts
in nutritional counseling. Subjects received a diet-
overview  handout,  instructional  nutrition  labels,
sample menus and recipes, and a book on counting
5
calories  and  carbohydrates.
  No  specific  exercise
program was recommended. The subjects assigned
to the low-carbohydrate diet were instructed to re-
6
strict carbohydrate intake to 30 g per day or less.
No instruction on restricting total fat intake was
provided. Vegetables and fruits with high ratios of

subjects assigned to the low-fat diet received in-
struction in accordance with the obesity-manage-
ment guidelines of the National Heart, Lung, and
7
Blood Institute,
 including caloric restriction suf-
ficient to create a deficit of 500 calories per day,
with  30  percent  or  less  of  total  calories  derived
from fat.

data collection
The subjects’ weights were measured monthly on a
single calibrated scale (SRScales, SR Instruments).
Other data collected at enrollment and at six months
included waist size, self-reported medical history,
blood pressure, and glucose and serum lipid levels,
measured  in  blood  specimens  obtained  after  an
overnight fast (Synchron LX20 Clinical Chemistry
System, Beckman Coulter). Low-density lipopro-
tein cholesterol levels were calculated according

were measured by radioimmunoassay (Laboratory
Corporation of America). Insulin sensitivity was es-
timated with use of the quantitative insulin-sensitiv-
ity check index as follows: 1÷[(log fasting insulin
level, in microunits per milliliter)+(log fasting glu-
cose level, in milligrams per deciliter)]; this index
has a good correlation with the results of glucose-
clamp studies in obese subjects and subjects with
9
diabetes.
  Dietary  compliance  was  estimated  by
  instrument  in
means  of  a  previously  validated
which  subjects  are  interviewed  to  obtain  data  on
24-hour recall of dietary consumption. Data were
analyzed with Nutribase Management software (Cy-
berSoft).

The  primary  end  point  was  weight  loss  at  six

drate group than in the low-fat group.
 Given an
anticipated dropout rate of 25 percent, we set the
enrollment target at 135 subjects. By six months,
79 subjects remained in the study (36 in the low-fat
group and 43 in the low-carbohydrate group). The
primary analysis included all 132 subjects: the 79
subjects who completed the study, the 29 subjects
who dropped out but had six-month data available
from records of routine office visits, and the 24 sub-
jects for whom the weight recorded at the last fol-
low-up visit was carried forward. Since the 29 sub-
jects whose final weight was obtained from office
records were weighed on a different scale from that
used in the study, we performed a second analysis
that  included  all  subjects,  with  base-line  weights
carried forward for all 53 subjects who dropped out.
For analyses of changes in dietary intake, serum
lipid levels, glycemic control, and insulin sensitivi-
ty, we included all subjects, with base-line values
carried forward for subjects who dropped out of
the study. No interim analyses were performed.

For comparison of continuous variables between
the two groups, we calculated the change from base
line to six months in each subject and compared
the mean changes in the two diet groups using an
unpaired  t-test.
  We  assessed  the  normality  of
the distribution of all variables before using the
t-test. Triglyceride, insulin, and glucose levels were
skewed  and  were  therefore  log-transformed  for
analysis. Dichotomous variables were compared by
chi-square analysis.

way analysis of covariance models were used to cor-

puted by linear extrapolation on the basis of height
and weight. All P values were two-sided, and a P val-
ue of 0.05 or less was considered to indicate statis-
tical significance. Analyses were performed with
use of SPSS software (version 10.0).

base-line characteristics
Sixty-eight  subjects  were  randomly  assigned  to
the low-fat diet and 64 to the low-carbohydrate
diet  (Fig.  1).  Subjects  in  the  two  groups  were
well matched with regard to base-line characteris-
tics (Table 1). The subjects were severely obese at
base line (Table 1), with a high prevalence of dia-
betes (39 percent) or the metabolic syndrome with-
13
out diabetes (43 percent), as previously defined.

attrition
The cumulative percentage of subjects who dropped
out of the study by months 1, 3, and 6 were 38, 44,
and 47 percent, respectively, in the low-fat group
and 25, 27, and 33 percent, respectively, in the low-
carbohydrate group. Differences in attrition be-
tween groups were statistically significant by the
third month (P=0.03) but were not significant at
six months (P=0.10). There were no significant dif-
ferences between the groups in the characteristics
of the subjects who dropped out of the study (Table
2). Subjects on the low-carbohydrate diet attended
more dietary counseling sessions than did the sub-

assessment of dietary intake
After six months of dietary counseling, subjects on
the low-fat diet reported a decrease in caloric con-
sumption while their macronutrient composition
was close to the guidelines of the National Heart,
7
Lung, and Blood Institute (Table 3).
 As compared
with the subjects on the low-fat diet, subjects on
the low-carbohydrate diet reported a nonsignifi-
cantly greater reduction in caloric intake (P=0.33),
a significantly greater decrease in the percentage of
calories from carbohydrates (P<0.001), and a sig-
nificantly greater increase in the percentage of cal-
ories from protein (P<0.001) and fat (P=0.004).

weight loss

weight during the six-month study than did those

4.2 kg; 95 percent confidence interval for the dif-
ference in weight loss between groups, –1.6 to –6.3;

between the groups remained significant after ad-
justment for base-line variables alone (age, race or
ethnic group, sex, base-line body-mass index, base-
line caloric intake, and the presence or absence of
hypertension, diabetes, active smoking, and sleep
apnea) (P=0.002) and for base-line variables plus
the number of dietary counseling sessions attend-
ed (P=0.01).

A second analysis in which we carried forward

subjects) still demonstrated greater weight loss in

a low-carbohydrate as compared with a low-fat diet in severe obesity

As  a  measure  of  substantial  weight  loss,  we
found that a weight loss of at least 10 percent of the
base-line weight occurred in 9 of 64 subjects on the
low-carbohydrate  diet  (14  percent),  as  compared
with 2 of 68 subjects on the low-fat diet (3 percent)
(P=0.02).  White  subjects  lost  more  weight  than
±
±
black subjects (mean, –13
19 kg vs. –5
12 kg; P=
0.009), regardless of the diet-group assignment.
There  were  no  other  significant  differences  in
weight loss between the groups.

serum lipids
During the six-month study, there was a greater de-
crease in the mean triglyceride level in the low-car-
±
bohydrate group than in the low-fat group (–20
43
±
percent vs. –4
31 percent, P=0.001) (Table 4). This
difference  remained  significant  after  adjustment
for base-line variables (P<0.001). Subjects on the
low-carbohydrate diet also had a greater mean de-
crease  in  triglyceride  levels  whether  or  not  they

were taking lipid-lowering drugs (–25

ide levels may also be affected by medications tak-
en for diabetes. However, in a separate analysis of
subjects who were not taking either diabetes medi-
cations or lipid-lowering medications (28 on the
low-fat diet and 24 on the low-carbohydrate diet),
we still observed a greater reduction in the mean
triglyceride level among subjects on the low-carbo-

P=0.001). In a model adjusted for the amount of
weight lost and the base-line variables, assignment
to  the  low-carbohydrate  diet  (P=0.01)  and  the
amount of weight lost (P<0.001) were each inde-
pendent predictors of a decrease in the triglyceride
level.  However,  comparison  of  subjects  within
weight-loss strata demonstrated that this finding
was limited to subjects who lost more than 5 per-
cent of their base-line weight.

Black subjects had a smaller decrease in triglyc-
±
eride levels than did white subjects (mean, –1

diet-group assignment (P=0.002), but not after ad-

levels did not change significantly during the six-
month study within or between groups (Table 4).

group at six months (–9

cent, P=0.02) (Table 4). This difference remained
significant after adjustment for base-line variables
(P=0.004). However, the greater reduction in se-
rum glucose levels in the low-carbohydrate group
was limited to diabetic subjects, with no significant
change in the levels in nondiabetic subjects on ei-
ther diet (Table 4). Assignment to the low-carbo-
hydrate diet was no longer a significant predictor
of a decrease in glucose levels after adjustment for
the amount of weight lost (P=0.12). There was a
trend toward a greater decrease in mean glycosylat-
ed hemoglobin values in diabetic subjects on the
low-carbohydrate diet, as compared with those on
the low-fat diet (P=0.06) (Table 4). By six months,
seven subjects in the low-carbohydrate group had
had dose reductions in oral hypoglycemic agents
or insulin. In comparison, one subject in the low-fat
group had a dose reduction in insulin and one sub-
ject began oral therapy.

the low-carbohydrate diet had a greater increase
in insulin sensitivity than those on the low-fat diet
±
±
(6
9 percent vs. –3
8 percent, P=0.01). This dif-
ference  remained  significant  after  adjustment  for
base-line variables (P=0.001). In a model adjusted
for the amount of weight lost and base-line varia-
bles, assignment to the low-carbohydrate diet (P=
0.01) and the amount of weight lost (P<0.001) were
each independent predictors of an improvement in
insulin sensitivity. Comparison of subjects within

weight-loss strata demonstrated a uniformly, but
nonsignificantly, greater improvement in insulin
sensitivity among those on the low-carbohydrate
diet within each stratum.

blood pressure
We did not observe significant overall or between-
group changes in blood pressure. Systolic and dia-
stolic blood pressure decreased by 2 mm Hg and
1 mm Hg, respectively, in the low-carbohydrate
group. In the low-fat group, both systolic and dia-
stolic blood pressure decreased by 2 mm Hg (P=
0.85 for between-group differences in the change
in systolic blood pressure and P=0.70 for between-
group differences in the change in diastolic blood
pressure). Although many subjects were receiving
antihypertensive therapy at base line (Table 1), none
had a change in this therapy during the study.

adverse reactions
One subject on the low-carbohydrate diet was hos-
pitalized with chest pain, which was ultimately de-
termined to be unrelated to myocardial ischemia.
One  subject  on  the  low-carbohydrate  diet  died
from complications of hyperosmolar coma, which
was  thought  to  be  due  to  poor  compliance  with
drug therapy for diabetes. There was no clinically
significant  change  in  the  uric  acid  level  in  either
group (Table 4).

discussion

We found that severely obese subjects with a high
prevalence of diabetes and the metabolic syndrome
lost more weight in a six-month period on a car-
bohydrate-restricted diet than on a fat- and calorie-
restricted diet. The greater weight loss in the low-
carbohydrate group suggests a greater reduction in
overall caloric intake, rather than a direct effect of
macronutrient composition. However, the explana-
tion for this difference is not clear. Subjects in this
group may have experienced greater satiety on a diet
with liberal proportions of protein and fat. How-
ever, other potential explanations include the sim-
plicity of the diet and improved compliance related
to the novelty of the diet.

Subjects  in  the  low-carbohydrate  group  had
greater decreases in triglyceride levels than did sub-
jects in the low-fat group; nondiabetic subjects on
the low-carbohydrate diet had greater increases in
insulin sensitivity, and subjects with diabetes on
this diet had a greater improvement in glycemic

and endothelial dysfunction.
 Impaired glycemic
control in subjects with other features of the meta-
bolic syndrome markedly increases the risk of cor-
onary artery disease.
 As expected, we found that
the amount of weight lost had a significant effect
on the degree of improvement in these metabolic
factors. However, even after adjustment for the dif-
ferences in weight loss between the groups, assign-
ment to the low-carbohydrate diet predicted great-
er improvements in triglyceride levels and insulin
sensitivity. Subjects who lost more than 5 percent of
their base-line weight on a carbohydrate-restrict-
ed diet had greater decreases in triglyceride levels
than those who lost a similar amount of weight
while following a calorie- and fat-restricted diet.

There was a consistent trend across weight-loss
strata toward a greater increase in insulin sensitivi-
ty in the low-carbohydrate group, although these
changes were small and were not significant with-
in each stratum. Although greater weight loss could
not entirely account for the greater decrease in tri-
glyceride levels and increase in insulin sensitivity in
the low-carbohydrate group, we cannot definitively
conclude  that  carbohydrate  restriction  alone  ac-
counted for this independent effect. Other uncon-
trolled variables, such as the types of carbohydrates

a low-carbohydrate as compared with a low-fat diet in severe obesity

Many of our subjects were taking lipid-lowering
medications  and  hypoglycemic  agents.  Although
enrolling  these  subjects  introduced  confounding
variables, it allowed the inclusion of subjects with
the obesity-related medical disorders typically en-
countered in clinical practice. Analyses from which
these subjects were excluded still revealed greater
improvements in insulin sensitivity and triglycer-
ide levels on a carbohydrate-restricted diet than on
a fat- and calorie-restricted diet.

Our study included a high proportion of black
subjects, a group previously underrepresented in
lifestyle-modification studies. As compared with
the white subjects, the black subjects had a smaller
overall weight loss. Future studies should explore
whether greater weight loss in this population can
be achieved by more effective incorporation of cul-
turally sensitive dietary counseling.

The high dropout rate in our study occurred very
early and affected our findings. The very early drop-
out of these subjects may indicate that attrition most
closely reflected base-line motivation to lose weight,
rather than a response to the dietary intervention
itself.

Taken together, our findings demonstrate that
severely obese subjects with a high prevalence of

diabetes and the metabolic syndrome lost more
weight  during  six  months  on  a  carbohydrate-
restricted diet than on a calorie- and fat-restricted
diet. The carbohydrate-restricted diet led to greater
improvements in insulin sensitivity that were in-
dependent of weight loss and a greater reduction
in  triglyceride  levels  in  subjects  who  lost  more
than  5  percent  of  their  base-line  weight.  These
findings must be interpreted with caution, howev-
er, since the magnitude of the overall weight loss
relative to our subjects’ severe obesity was small,
and it is unclear whether these benefits of a car-
bohydrate-restricted  diet  extend  beyond  six
months. Furthermore, the high dropout rate and
the small overall weight loss demonstrate that die-
tary  adherence  was  relatively  low  in  both  diet
groups. This study proves a principle and does not
provide clinical guidance; given the known bene-
fits  of  fat  restriction,  future  studies  evaluating
long-term  cardiovascular  outcomes  are  needed
before  a  carbohydrate-restricted  diet  can  be  en-
dorsed.
