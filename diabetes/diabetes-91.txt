OBJECTIVE — To examine the associations between reported intakes of dietary fat and
incident type 2 diabetes.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS — We studied the relation between dietary
fatty acids and diabetes in a prospective cohort study of 35,988 older women who initially did
not have diabetes. Diet was assessed with a food frequency questionnaire at baseline, and 1,890
incident cases of diabetes occurred during 11 years of follow-up.

RESULTS — After adjusting for age, smoking, alcohol consumption, BMI, waist-to-hip ratio,
physical activity, demographic factors, and dietary magnesium and cereal ﬁber, diabetes inci-
dence was negatively associated with dietary polyunsaturated fatty acids, vegetable fat, and trans
fatty acids and positively associated with v-3 fatty acids, cholesterol, and the Keys score. After
simultaneous adjustment for other dietary fat, only vegetable fat remained clearly related to
diabetes risk. Relative risks across quintiles of vegetable fat intake were 1.00, 0.90, 0.87, 0.84,
and 0.82 (P 5 0.02). Diabetes risk was also inversely related to substituting polyunsaturated fatty
acids for saturated fatty acids and positively correlated to the Keys dietary score.

CONCLUSIONS — These data support an inverse relation between incident type 2 diabetes
and vegetable fat and substituting polyunsaturated fatty acids for saturated fatty acids and
cholesterol.

Diabetes Care 24:1528 –1535, 2001

A lthough a low-fat diet is recom-

mended for diabetic and nondia-
betic patients (1), ﬁndings from
epidemiological studies on the associa-
tion of total dietary fat with type 2 diabe-
tes or insulin sensitivity have been
inconsistent (2– 8). Metabolic and epide-
miological studies suggest that dietary fat
subtypes may be relevant to diabetes
pathophysiology. Speciﬁc dietary fatty ac-
ids may inﬂuence the development of di-
abetes by modifying the phospholipid
composition of cell membranes, which in
turn may alter the function of the insulin
receptor (9,10).

While controlling for dietary and

nondietary factors, we examined the rela-
tion between baseline intake of total di-
etary fat and dietary fat subtypes and the
development of type 2 diabetes over 11
years of follow-up in the Iowa Women’s
Health Study.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND
METHODS — The Iowa Women’s
Health Study is a prospective cohort
study of older Iowa women. In January
1986, a random sample of 99,826 women
aged 55– 69 years who had a valid Iowa
driver’s license were mailed a 16-page
questionnaire and asked to participate.
The study sample consisted of the 41,836

women who returned the baseline ques-
tionnaire. Respondents had a lower mean
BMI (0.4 kg/m2 less), were 3 months
older, and were more likely to live in
counties that were rural and less afﬂuent
than nonrespondents (11).

Women were excluded from analysis
if they reported implausibly high
(.5,000 kcal) or low (,600 kcal) energy
intakes, left $30 items blank on the food-
frequency questionnaire, or had diabetes
at baseline. Women were considered to
have diabetes at baseline if they respond-
ed “yes” or “don’t know” to one of the
following questions: 1) have you ever
been told by a doctor that you have sugar
diabetes? and 2) have you ever taken in-
sulin or pills for sugar diabetes (or to
lower blood glucose)? After exclusions,
35,988 women remained eligible for the
study.

Data collection
The baseline questionnaire included
questions on known or suspected risk fac-
tors for diabetes, such as age, BMI, waist-
to-hip ratio (WHR), physical activity,
alcohol consumption, and smoking his-
tory. BMI was calculated from weight and
height measurements provided by the
participants. WHR was calculated as the
average of two measurements taken by
the participant’s spouse or friend using a
paper tape measure that was included
with the questionnaire (12). The women
reported their frequency of moderate
(e.g., golf and long walks) and vigorous
(e.g., swimming and aerobics) physical
activity. Pack-years of smoking were cal-
culated from information on the intensity
and duration of cigarette smoking. Alco-
hol consumption was assessed with a food
frequency questionnaire that queried the
participants’ typical intakes of wine, beer,
and spirits. In addition, the participants
provided information on their marital sta-
tus, educational attainment, residence,
and use of hormone replacement therapy.
The principal dietary exposure of in-
terest was intake of fat, including choles-
terol and the Keys score. In addition to
total dietary fat, we analyzed saturated,
polyunsaturated, monounsaturated, trans
fatty acids, long-chain v-3 fatty acids, and

animal and vegetable fat. The Keys score,
which correlates changes in fatty acid in-
take with changes in serum cholesterol,
was calculated as 1.26 (2S 2 P) 1 (Z)1/2,
where S 5 percent of energy from satu-
rated fat, P 5 percent of energy from
polyunsaturated fat, and Z 5 dietary cho-
lesterol in mg/1,000 kcal (13). A higher
Keys score corresponds to higher relative
intake of saturated fat and cholesterol and
a lower relative intake of polyunsaturated
fat. We also examined several foods and
food groups high in dietary fats, including
total meat, red meat, eggs, nuts, and olive
oil salad dressing.

A 127-item food-frequency question-
naire similar to that used in the 1984
Nurses’ Health Study was used to assess
typical food intake over the previous year
(14). The validity of the food-frequency
questionnaire was evaluated by compar-
ing nutrient values determined from the
questionnaire with values estimated from
the average of ﬁve 24-h dietary recall sur-
veys in 44 study participants (15). Ener-
gy-adjusted Pearson’s correlation
coefﬁcients were 0.62, 0.59, 0.62, 0.43,
and 0.21 for total fat, saturated fat, mono-
unsaturated fat, polyunsaturated fat, and
cholesterol, respectively. Correlation co-
efﬁcients were not calculated for other fat
variables.

Diabetes incidence was determined
by an afﬁrmative response to the follow-
ing question, which was on all of the fol-
low-up mailed surveys: “Since baseline or
respective follow-up, were you diagnosed
for the ﬁrst time by a doctor as having
sugar diabetes?” During 11 years of fol-
low-up, 1,890 women reported incident
diabetes in the four follow-up surveys ad-
ministered in 1987 (n 5 344), 1989 (n 5
331), 1992 (n 5 466), and 1997 (n 5
749). Response rates for the four fol-
low-up surveys were 91, 89, 86, and 79%,
respectively.

A validation study of self-reported di-
abetes was conducted on 85 cohort par-
ticipants in 1988 after the ﬁrst follow-up
survey. Subjects tended to over-report
having diabetes; of 44 women who re-
ported having diabetes at baseline, 28
(64%) were conﬁrmed as having diabetes
by their physician. All 41 women who re-
ported not having diabetes at baseline were
conﬁrmed as not having diabetes (16).

sis of diabetes, person-time-at-risk was

betes, person-time was calculated as the
sum of the known disease-free period and
half of the period during which the diag-
nosis was made. Mortality status was de-
termined annually through linkage with
the State Health Registry of Iowa or, in the
case of nonrespondents and emigrants
from Iowa, via the National Death Index.
Nutrient intakes were adjusted for to-
tal energy through the residual method (17)
and divided into quintiles. Trend analyses
weighted each category of dietary intake
by the median intake for that category. Cox
proportional hazards regression models
provided estimates of rate ratios (RRs).
The SAS package was used (18); all P val-
ues were two-sided.

To examine the independent effects
of speciﬁc fat subtypes, we simultaneous-
ly adjusted for all fat subtypes. Because we
adjusted for dietary protein, the regres-
sion coefﬁcients are an estimate of the ef-
fect of substituting a speciﬁc fat subtype
for carbohydrates in the diet. We further
examined substituting one fat subtype for
another by including total fat and all fat
subtypes except the subtype for which we
substituted (19).

RESULTS — The distributions of sev-
eral known risk factors for diabetes and
correlation coefﬁcients among dietary fat
variables are presented in Table 1.
Women in the highest category of satu-
rated, monounsaturated, trans fatty acids,
and animal fat had a higher BMI and
WHR, but they consumed less alcohol
and engaged in less physical activity. For
cholesterol, these relations were similar
but not as pronounced. The risk-factor
differences among categories of polyun-
saturated and v-3 fatty acids and vegeta-
ble fat were not extreme. Overall, 99% of
the population was non-Hispanic white
and 95% were of Protestant or Catholic
religious faith; these distributions did not
vary according to fat intake. Positive cor-
relations were evident between total and
saturated fat, total and monounsaturated
fat, animal and saturated fat, and vegeta-
ble and polyunsaturated fat.

After adjusting for nondietary factors
in a multivariate regression analysis, total
dietary fat, saturated fatty acids, and
monounsaturated fatty acids were not re-
lated to incident diabetes (Table 2). Ani-
mal fat, cholesterol, the Keys score, and

v-3 fatty acids were positively correlated
to diabetes. Comparing the highest with
the lowest levels of intake, animal fat was
associated with a 20% increase in incident
diabetes (RR 1.19 and 95% CI 1.02–
1.39). Comparing the highest with the
lowest quintiles of intake, diabetes inci-
dence increased with dietary cholesterol
intake and the Keys score (1.24, 1.07–
1.43) and (1.27, 1.08 –1.49), respective-
ly. There were inverse relations with poly-
unsaturated fatty acids and trans fatty
acids and vegetable fat. Relative risks
among quintiles of intake were 1.0, 0.93,
0.90, 0.84, and 0.87 (P 5 0.03) and 1.0,
0.88, 0.84, 0.81, and 0.78 (P 5 0.0007)
for polyunsaturated fatty acids and vege-
table fat, respectively.

We further adjusted for dietary mag-
nesium and cereal ﬁber (Table 2), both of
which were inversely related to diabetes
incidence in this population (20). After
this adjustment, animal fat was no longer
related to diabetes risk (P 5 0.24). Also
attenuated were relations with dietary
cholesterol and the Keys score. Compar-
ing the highest to the lowest category of
intake, the RRs for cholesterol and the
Keys score were 1.17 (95% CI 1.01–1.37)
and 1.17 (0.99 –1.38), respectively.

After simultaneous adjustment for
other dietary fat subtypes, vegetable fat
remained clearly associated with type 2
diabetes (Table 3). Relative risks across
quintiles of vegetable fat intake were 1.00,
0.90, 0.87, 0.84, and 0.82 (P 5 0.02),
and they did not change appreciably after
further adjustment for vitamin E. When
we substituted polyunsaturated fatty ac-
ids for saturated fatty acids and vegetable
fat for animal fat, we found that they were
inversely related to diabetes risk. RRs
across polyunsaturated fat intake were
1.0, 0.92, 0.89, 0.83, and 0.84 (P 5
0.02). Comparing the highest to the low-
est category of vegetable intake, the RR
was 0.78 (95% CI 0.67– 0.91).

We analyzed foods and food groups
that contribute to fat intake. Total meat
intake was positively correlated to diabe-
tes risk. Relative risks across categories of
intake were 1.0, 1.04, 1.07, 1.15, and
1.35 (P 5 0.0004). After adjustment for
vegetable fat and dietary cholesterol, mag-
nesium, and cereal ﬁber, the relative risks
across categories of intake were 1.0, 1.01,
1.02, 1.06, and 1.19 (P 5 0.07). Eggs
were also positively correlated to diabetes
risk, with RRs across categories of intake
of 1.0, 1.01, 1.11, and 1.21 (P 5 0.02).

This relation was eliminated after the ad-
justment for dietary cholesterol (P 5
0.99). Foods high in vegetable fat, such as
nuts, olive oil dressing, and margarine
were not clearly related to diabetes risk.
There was no evidence in these data
for modiﬁcation of the relation between
vegetable fat and diabetes by BMI. The
relative risks for increasing vegetable fat
intake roughly indicated a 20% reduction
in diabetes when comparing the highest
and lowest tertiles of vegetable fat in both
the lowest and highest BMI tertiles. Simi-
larly, we did not ﬁnd support for effect
modiﬁcation by physical activity, alcohol
consumption, or vitamin E intake.

CONCLUSIONS — Data from this
prospective study of older women indi-
cate that the composition of dietary fat
may play a role in the development of type
2 diabetes. After adjusting for potential
confounding variables and animal fat, we
found an inverse relation between vegeta-
ble fat and incident type 2 diabetes. Poly-
unsaturated fatty acid was inversely
related to diabetes risk when substituted
for saturated fatty acid, and the Keys di-
etary score was positively correlated to
diabetes.

There was no relation between di-
etary fat and diabetes in several prospec-
tive studies, which was consistent with
our ﬁndings (5– 8). Among 1,462 Swed-
ish women, the mean intake of total di-
etary fat (based on a diet history) did not
differ for women who did and did not go
on to develop diabetes (7). The percent of
energy derived from fat did not differ
among Pima Indian women who devel-
oped diabetes compared with those who
remained disease free (6).

However, other prospective studies
have shown a positive correlation be-
tween diabetes and total dietary fat.
Among subjects with impaired glucose
tolerance (IGT), total dietary fat (assessed
by 24-h recall) predicted conversion to
diabetes within 1–3 years (21). In two co-
horts of the Seven Countries Study, the
percent of energy from fat predicted dia-
betes and was positively correlated to
postload glucose levels after 20 years of
follow-up (22).

Results from cross-sectional studies
have been similarly mixed. A positive cor-
relation between insulin sensitivity, de-
rived from postload insulin and glucose
measurements, and total dietary fat,

rolamo (23), was apparent only before ad-
justing for BMI. Two other studies also
found no association with fasting insulin
after accounting for BMI (24,25), whereas
another study (26) found that total fat was
unrelated to fasting insulin in univariate
and multivariate analyses. In contrast,
several studies (27–30) found a positive
correlation between total dietary fat and
fasting or postprandial insulin (indepen-
dent of BMI) or a negative correlation
with insulin sensitivity (34).

Our ﬁndings are consistent with
some, but not all, prospective epidemio-
logical studies that have examined sub-
types of dietary fatty acids. In one study,
vegetable fat and polyunsaturated fatty
acids were inversely related to incident
type 2 diabetes among lean women but
not among obese women (31); saturated
fatty acids, monounsaturated fatty acids,
and animal fats were not related to diabe-
tes. Although statistically nonsigniﬁcant,
the RRs (0.85 among women and 0.83
among men comparing the highest with
the lowest quintile of vegetable fat con-
sumption) for incident diabetes reported
in two studies by Salmeron and col-
leagues (32,33) were strikingly similar to
ours for vegetable fat. Incident diabetes
and conversion to diabetes were posi-

tively correlated to saturated fat and un-
related to polyunsaturated fat in two other
follow-up studies (21,22). These ﬁndings
are more in line with those from most
cross-sectional studies, in which satu-
rated fat was positively correlated to fast-
ing insulin (24,26 –29) or area under the
insulin curve (34) and inversely related to
insulin sensitivity (34). The ﬁndings for
polyunsaturated fatty acids from these
studies were more varied, showing inverse
(34), positive (27), and no correlation
(25,28,29,34) with insulin concentra-
tions or sensitivity.

The inverse relationship between di-
abetes and vegetable fat remained after
adjustment for other dietary fat, but that
for polyunsaturated fatty acids did not.
Likewise, Salmeron and colleagues
(32,33) reported no association between
polyunsaturated fatty acids and diabetes.
When the highest to the lowest quintiles
of polyunsaturated fatty acid intake were
compared, the adjusted relative risks for
diabetes were 0.97 in women and 1.01 in
men. Vegetable fat includes fats found in
nonanimal sources, including fruits and
vegetables, grains, nuts, and oils. It is pos-
sible that vegetable fat represents the
combination of several potentially health-
ful fat subtypes, including polyunsatu-

rated fatty acids and monounsaturated
fatty acids, from vegetable sources. Fur-
thermore, although we considered several
dietary factors that have been hypothe-
sized to relate to diabetes risk, such as
vitamin E, cereal ﬁber, and magnesium,
vegetable fat will be highly correlated
with any number of additional nutrients
that we did not include, which may inﬂu-
ence diabetes risk.

Although polyunsaturated fatty acids
were not related to diabetes after adjust-
ing for all other fatty acids, a true inverse
relation is possible. It may be argued that
dietary factors are so highly correlated
that a high degree of attenuation is inevi-
table with simultaneous adjustment for
dietary factors. When substituted for sat-
urated fatty acids in the diet, polyunsatu-
rated fatty acids were inversely related to
diabetes, whereas the Keys score was pos-
itively correlated to diabetes. These ﬁnd-
ings are consistent with data from a 10-
year follow-up study of middle-aged men
who did and did not develop type 2 dia-
betes (35). Men who did develop type 2
diabetes had a higher proportion of satu-
rated fatty acids and a lower proportion of
linoleic acid in serum cholesterol esters,
which in part reﬂects dietary fatty acid
composition, than men who did not de-

velop type 2 diabetes (35). A cross-
sectional study of 45 subjects found no
relationship between insulin sensitivity
and the ratio of dietary polyunsaturated
fatty acids to saturated fatty acids (23).

Feeding studies support a positive
correlation between monounsaturated
fatty acid intake and insulin sensitivity
(36 –39). In our study population, mono-
unsaturated fatty acid consumption was
more highly correlated with saturated and
animal fat consumption (correlation coef-
ﬁcients 0.70 and 0.62, respectively) than
with polyunsaturated and vegetable fat
consumption (correlation coefﬁcients
0.43 and 0.29, respectively). This may
limit our ability to isolate the effects of
individual fats; it underscores the impor-
tance of the speciﬁc dietary characteristics
of studied populations. Such correlations
will be somewhat population-speciﬁc;
they may have contributed to the positive
associations between monounsaturated
fat and incident diabetes (22), to the pro-
gression to diabetes from IGT (21), and to
fasting insulin (27,28) in some studies,
but the inverse relation with insulin sen-
sitivity (34) appears in other studies.

In our study, diabetes was positively
correlated to dietary cholesterol and the
Keys score. Similarly, Feskens et al. (22)
found a positive correlation between di-
etary cholesterol and 20-year diabetes in-
cidence in two Seven Countries Study
cohorts. Conversely, two cross-sectional
studies found no association between di-
etary cholesterol and fasting or postpran-
dial insulin (26,34). It is unclear how
dietary cholesterol may affect diabetes in-
cidence, and our ﬁndings should be inter-
preted with caution, particularly because
the association was attenuated after ad-
justment for other dietary fat variables.

Dietary cholesterol is related to serum
cholesterol levels to some extent (40), and
it is possible that changes in serum cho-
lesterol explain the association between
dietary cholesterol and diabetes risk (40).
Our ﬁndings for the Keys score are con-
sistent with the ﬁnding that the Keys di-
etary score indicates positive changes in
serum cholesterol predicted by positive
changes in dietary cholesterol and satu-
rated fatty acids and negative changes in
polyunsaturated fatty acids (13). In two
other studies, the univariate or age-
adjusted rate of incident diabetes was
50% greater in the highest than in the
lowest category of serum cholesterol, al-
though the estimate from only one study

was statistically signiﬁcant (5,8). How-
ever, it is difﬁcult to distinguish the rela-
tions between the Keys score and serum
cholesterol from the relation between the
Keys score and saturated and polyunsat-
urated fatty acid intake, for which the ev-
idence of an association with diabetes is
far more compelling.

Differential intakes of dietary fat sub-
types may affect diabetes risk by modify-
ing the fatty acid composition of the
phospholipid membrane, which may play
a role in blood glucose regulation through
effects on insulin secretion, insulin recep-
tor properties, and glucose transport.
Borkman et al. (41) reported signiﬁcant
inverse relations between fasting serum
insulin and the content of v-3 and v-6
fatty acids within skeletal-muscle phos-
pholipids. Compared with saturated fatty
acids, polyunsaturated fatty acids appear
to enhance insulin secretion (42), and sat-
urated fatty acids have been shown to de-
crease insulin binding to receptors and to
impair glucose transport (9).

Error in the measurement of diet, di-
abetes, and covariates in this study may
have limited our ability to obtain accurate
relative-risk estimates. Random measure-
ment error in dietary exposures most fre-
quently attenuates risk estimates (43). Of
particular interest is the potential for mis-
classiﬁcation of trans fatty acid intake that
resulted from temporal changes in the
consumption and manufacturing patterns
of trans fatty acids in the U.S. during the
1980s, when many consumers switched
to soft, reduced trans fat margarine and
industry ceased the partial hydrogenation
of household salad and cooking oils (44).
These changes could have resulted in a
large misclassiﬁcation of trans fatty acid
intake in our population.

The validation study correlation coef-
ﬁcient for cholesterol was quite low
(0.21). This did not prevent us from de-
tecting an association between cholesterol
and diabetes, but it may reﬂect a degree of
random error in this variable that pre-
vented us from detecting a truly larger
magnitude of association. Our validation
sample was quite small (n 5 44), and it is
possible that our sample was aberrant;
correlations for other fat variables were
similar to those obtained in another large
study of women, in which the correlation
coefﬁcient for cholesterol was 0.61 (14).
Incident cases of diabetes were ascer-
tained by self-report. Our validation
study (see above) suggested that partici-

Meyer and Associates

pants over-reported diabetes compared
with physician diagnoses (16). This is
consistent with ﬁndings from one study
(45) in which 29 of 44 (66%) positive
reports of diabetes were validated with
medical records. Nonvalidated positive
reports may nonetheless reﬂect some level
of diabetes. One study found that several
persons with nonvalidated positive re-
ports of diabetes had some history of
glycosuria (46). Thus, nondiabetic con-
centrations of blood glucose may not be
entirely benign, and women who falsely
reported a diagnosis of diabetes may still
have some level of underlying disease,
such as IGT. This possibility is supported
by the change in the diagnostic criteria for
diabetes to lower levels of fasting glucose
(47). The ascertainment of diabetes in the
present study was sensitive enough to
conﬁrm associations with other risk fac-
tors for diabetes (i.e., weight [16], physi-
cal activity [48], and dietary ﬁber [20])
obtained from studies with validated dia-
betes. Assuming that the error in diabetes
ascertainment was independent and non-
differential, present ﬁndings would only
be strengthened by more accurate ascer-
tainment of disease.

Dietary fat may contribute to the eti-
ology of type 2 diabetes. After adjusting
for nondietary and dietary covariates, we
found that vegetable fat was inversely re-
lated to incident diabetes in this popula-
tion of older Iowa women. In addition,
substituting polyunsaturated fatty acids
for saturated fatty acids appeared to re-
duce the rate of diabetes.
