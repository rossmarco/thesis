Abstract

Although diet and nutrition are widely believed to
play an important part in the development of Type
II (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus, specific
dietary factors have not been clearly defined. Much
controversy exists about the relations between the
amount and types of dietary fat and carbohydrate
and the risk of diabetes. In this article, we review in
detail the current evidence regarding the associations
between different types of fats and carbohydrates and
insulin resistance and Type II diabetes. Our findings
indicate that a higher intake of polyunsaturated fat
and possibly long-chain n-3 fatty acids could be bene-
ficial, whereas a higher intake of saturated fat and
trans-fat could adversely affect glucose metabolism
and insulin resistance. In dietary practice, exchanging

nonhydrogenated polyunsaturated fat for saturated
and trans-fatty acids could appreciably reduce risk of
Type II diabetes. In addition, a low-glycaemic index
diet with a higher amount of fiber and minimally pro-
cessed whole grain products reduces glycaemic and
insulinaemic responses and lowers the risk of Type II
diabetes. Dietary recommendations to prevent Type
II diabetes should focus more on the quality of fat
and carbohydrate in the diet than quantity alone, in
addition to balancing total energy intake with expen-
diture to avoid overweight and obesity. [Diabetologia

The prevalence of Type II (non-insulin-dependent)
diabetes mellitus is increasing rapidly in the United
States [1] and worldwide [2]. Prevalence of diabetes
in adults in the world is estimated to reach 5.4 % and
the number of adults with diabetes to reach 300 mil-
lion worldwide in the year 2025 [2]. The toll of diabe-
tes on health and the economy is enormous and will
continue to rise. Because there is no currently avail-
able cure for diabetes, primary prevention through
diet and lifestyle modification is of paramount impor-
tance.

Although diet and nutrition are widely believed to
play an important part in the development of Type II
diabetes, specific dietary factors have not been clear-
ly defined. Much controversy exists about the rela-
tion between the amount and types of dietary fat
and carbohydrate and the risk of diabetes. Prevailing
dietary recommendations promote low-fat, high-car-

bohydrate diets for the prevention of diabetes, heart
disease, and other chronic diseases [3, 4]. However,
neither dietary fats nor carbohydrates are homoge-
neous molecules and it is now increasingly appreciat-
ed that different types of fat and carbohydrate have
different effects on glucose homeostasis and insulin
sensitivity. We review in detail the current evidence
regarding the association between types of fat and
carbohydrates and insulin resistance and Type II dia-
betes. We specifically discuss the roles of major types
of fat, trans-fatty acids and n-3 fatty acids, as well as
different types of carbohydrate and fiber, in the de-
velopment of insulin resistance and Type II diabetes.
We searched the Medline database for epidemio-
logic investigations of the associations between di-
etary fat and carbohydrate and the risk of developing
hyperglycaemia and Type II diabetes. We also care-
fully examined the cited references in the articles

tional relevant metabolic and animal studies.

Major types of fat in relation to insulin resistance
and Type II diabetes

Obesity predisposes to insulin resistance and is the
most important determinant of Type II diabetes [5,
6]. Dietary fatty acids could affect insulin resistance
independent of obesity, but the mechanism is not well
understood. It is believed that the effects of dietary
fatty acids are mediated through the fatty acid compo-
sition of cell membranes [7, 8]. It has been shown that
the fatty acid composition of the phospholipids in the
skeletal muscle cell membranes is directly related to
insulin sensitivity in humans [9]. A specific fatty acid
profile in cell membranes could influence insulin ac-
tion through several potential mechanisms, including
altering insulin receptor binding or affinity and influ-
encing ion permeability and cell signalling [8]. Be-
cause the change of fatty acid profile in cell mem-
branes requires at least several months [9], it is impor-
tant to consider the duration of the studies when inter-
preting the results from feeding studies on dietary fat-
ty acids and insulin resistance.

Dietary intervention studies. In animal studies, both
the type and the amount of dietary fat have been
shown to affect insulin sensitivity [10]. Several animal
studies have suggested beneficial effects of monosat-
urated or polyunsaturated fats on insulin action [11,
12]. On the other hand, diets with a very high fat con-
tent decreased insulin sensitivity in rats. It was shown
that animals fed a high-fat diet (59 % of energy sup-
plied by fat) had decreased insulin sensitivity com-
pared with animals fed a low-fat diet (12 % of energy
intake) [10].

In contrast to the findings in rats, dietary interven-
tions in humans showed no consistent deleterious ef-
fects of high-fat diets on insulin sensitivity. Some
studies, especially the earlier studies (all less than
one month), showed a decrease in insulin sensitivity
in patients receiving a high-fat diet [13]. These re-
sults, however, are difficult to interpret because the
order of diets was not randomized, the methods used
to measure insulin sensitivity had considerable weak-
nesses, or there were large differences in the diets in
addition to differences in fat content [13, 14]. Ran-
domized studies using the glucose clamp or the fre-
quently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test
(FSIGT) to measure insulin sensitivity generally did
not observe an effect of high-fat diets on insulin sensi-
tivity, despite a large range in their fat content
[15±17]. Only one of these studies reported a de-
crease in insulin sensitivity in patients who received
a high-fat diet (50 % energy) as compared with those
who received a low-fat diet (20 % energy), possibly

because of the large difference in the amount of satu-
rated fat between the diets [18].

Several short-term intervention studies compared
diets high in saturated fat with those higher in unsat-
urated fats and found no differences in measures of
glucose homeostasis between the randomized groups
[19±21]. These intervention studies were small and
only 4 weeks or less in duration. A recently complet-
ed multicenter study involving 3-month intervention
among 162 healthy men and women [22] showed
that a diet high in saturated fat (18 % of energy) de-
creased insulin sensitivity compared with a diet high
in monounsaturated fat (21 % of energy) with the
same total fat content. No effects on insulin secretion
or glucose metabolism were observed.

Epidemiologic studies with biomarkers of specific fat-
ty acids. Few epidemiologic studies have examined
biomarkers of fatty acids as predictors of Type II dia-
betes. In a 10-year follow-up study [23], men who de-
veloped Type II diabetes had a higher proportion of
saturated fatty acids and a lower proportion of linole-
ic acid in their serum cholesterol esters than did men
who did not develop diabetes at baseline. Similar as-
sociations were reported for cross-sectional studies
of insulin sensitivity [24, 25] and glucose intolerance
[26]. The fatty acid composition of serum cholesterol
esters reflects the average dietary fat intake in the
preceding weeks [23]. Therefore, the reported associ-
ations are consistent with a detrimental effect of diets
containing a high proportion of saturated fat and a
low proportion of linoleic acid on the development
of Type II diabetes. The findings could, however,
also reflect genetic differences in enzymatic activity
that can affect both insulin sensitivity and fatty acid
composition [23]. Moreover, deterioration in glucose
metabolism could cause changes in fatty acid compo-
sition, as insulin is known to affect the activity of de-
saturase enzymes [23].

Epidemiologic studies of dietary fats and insulin resis-
tance. Several cross-sectional studies examined di-
etary fat in relation to fasting and post-load plasma
insulin concentrations [27±33]. In general, these stud-
ies observed a positive association between saturated
fat intake and hyperinsulinaemia independent of
measures of body fat [28±32]. The Insulin Resistance
and Atherosclerosis study included the assessment
of insulin sensitivity by minimal model analysis of an
intravenous-glucose tolerance test in 1173 men and
women [34]. After multivariate adjustment for other
determinants of insulin resistance including BMI, di-
etary fats (total, saturated, monounsaturated, or
polyunsaturated fat) were not associated with insulin
sensitivity despite the large power of the study. The
only significant finding was an inverse association be-
tween polyunsaturated fat and insulin sensitivity
among obese participants (p = 0.04).

fat was associated with lower fasting plasma concen-
trations of glucose in an Italian study [41]. In contrast,
one study reported a positive association between
polyunsaturated fat intake and hyperglycaemia in
men, although no association was observed in women
[42]. In other studies, polyunsaturated fat was not as-
sociated with hyperglycaemia [43, 44] or with inci-
dence of Type II diabetes in men [45].

Intake of polyunsaturated fat was inversely associ-
ated with the area under the insulin curve in a study
of 389 men [31], whereas intake of linoleic acid was
positively associated with fasting insulin concentra-
tion in a study of 544 women twins [30]. A possible
explanation for the inconsistent findings for polyun-
saturated fat could be the lack of correction for corre-
lated intake of other types of fat. Two studies have
found a positive association between monounsaturat-
ed fat and insulin concentrations [28, 30], a finding
that could be due to confounding by saturated fat be-
cause monounsaturated fat is highly correlated with
saturated fat intake in a typical Western diet because
of shared food sources (e. g., beef and dairy prod-
ucts). In one study, adjustment for saturated fat in-
take substantially attenuated the positive association
between oleic acid (the primary mononunsaturated
fat in the diet) and hyperinsulinaemia [32].

Types of dietary fat and risk of hyperglycaemia and
Type II diabetes. Table 1 summarizes epidemiologic
studies that examined dietary fat in relation to hyper-
glycaemia or risk of clinical Type II diabetes. Because
patients who know their disease status might change
their diet, we did not include case-control studies or
cross-sectional studies that
included participants
with known diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance.
Most of the earlier cohort studies did not observe im-
portant associations between diet and incidence of
Type II diabetes [35±38]. This is not surprising given
the small number of cases [35±37] or limited assess-
ment of diet [38] in these studies. Also, the role of im-
portant risk factors for Type II diabetes such as body
fat and physical activity was not taken into account
in most of the analyses.

More recent prospective and cross-sectional stud-
ies were better designed and generally suggestive of
a role of specific types of fat rather than of total fat
in the development of Type II diabetes. A high intake
of vegetable fat was inversely associated with risk of
diagnosed Type II diabetes during 6 years of follow-
up among participants of the Nurses' Health Study
who were not obese [39]. Findings from this study af-
ter 14 years of follow-up with more than 2500 inci-
dent cases of diabetes confirmed this finding; high in-
takes of vegetable fat and polyunsaturated fat were
associated with a decreased risk of Type II diabetes
[40]. This association could not be explained by
BMI, physical activity, alcohol
intake, cigarette
smoking, family history of diabetes, total energy in-
take, or intake of other fats. The relative risk (RR)
of Type II diabetes after adjustment for these vari-
ables and other dietary fats was 0.75 (95 % CI,
0.65±0.88) for the highest quintile of polyunsaturated
fat intake versus the lowest quintile. The RR compar-
ing extreme quintiles of vegetable fat intake was 0.60
(95 % CI, 0.51±0.71; p < 0.0001). A higher consump-
tion of oils consisting primarily of polyunsaturated

Two cross-sectional studies [43, 46] and one small
prospective study [44] suggest a positive association
between saturated fat and hyperglycaemia or glucose
intolerance. Several large cohort studies that used di-
agnosed Type II diabetes as an endpoint, however,
did not observe an appreciable association with satu-
rated fat intake [39, 40, 45]. The metabolic effects of
substituting saturated fat for carbohydrate are com-
plex. Although this kind of substitution clearly in-
creases low-density lipoprotein LDL cholesterol [47]
and could adversely affect insulin resistance as dis-
cussed above, it also increases HDL and decreases
triglycerides [47], especially if high glycaemic index
carbohydrate foods are replaced by saturated fat.

Except for one small study on patients with im-
paired glucose tolerance [48], epidemiologic studies
generally did not find an association between intake
of monounsaturated fat and risk of Type II diabetes
[39, 44, 45]. Confounding by saturated fat could have
hindered the analysis for monounsaturated fat be-
cause they are highly correlated in a typical Western
diet. An interesting aspect of an Italian study was
the opportunity of examining intake of monounsatu-
rated fat with minimal confounding by intake of satu-
rated fat because of the high consumption of olive oil
[41]. Although total intake of monounsaturated fat
was not estimated in the study, high consumption of
olive oil was associated with lower fasting plasma glu-
cose concentrations.

Although there is little evidence to suggest that di-
etary cholesterol adversely influences glucose metab-
olism, a positive association of cholesterol intake with
hyperglycaemia [43] and diabetes risk (independent
of other fats) has been reported [40]. As cholesterol
is present only in animal products, these associations
could represent an adverse effect of a food pattern
characterized by high consumption of meat and eggs
or an unidentified component of animal products. In
this regard, the association between meat intake and
diabetes mortality (as mentioned on death certifi-
cates) observed in the Seven Day Adventist study is
of interest [49].

Available data suggest a potential beneficial effect
of polyunsaturated fat and a potential adverse effect
of saturated fat, although total fat does not appear to
predict risk of Type II diabetes. However, the findings
on types of dietary fat are not consistent. Some of the
inconsistencies could be due to different study popu-
lation characteristics such as age, sex, and underlying
insulin resistance resulting from obesity and inactivi-

ty. In addition, some studies evaluated insulin resis-
tance rather than diabetes risk, which can also be in-
fluenced by chronic insulin demand. The inconsisten-
cies could also be due to methodological limitations
in many studies, such as absence of control for other
types of fat. Confounding by other aspects of diet
such as fiber is likely because diets high in saturated
fat is usually accompanied by lower fiber intake.

Differences in the dietary assessment methods
could have also contributed to discrepant findings.
Earlier studies tended to use crude dietary assess-
ment methods with no documented validity. In the Is-
raeli Heart study, a validation substudy suggested
that the short dietary questionnaire used in the study
performed poorly as compared with a long Burke
questionnaire, which could explain the lack of associ-
ations [38]. The San Luis Valley Diabetes study [48]
used 24-hour diet recalls, which can represent a per-
son's usual diet poorly [50]. Other studies used short
dietary questionnaires with no reported information
on validity [41, 49]. Only a few studies have tested
the validity of their dietary assessment methods [42,
44, 51]. More recent studies [40, 45], using validated
FFQs and repeated measures and with large sample
size, are more powerful to examine the association
between diet and Type II diabetes.

Long-chain n-3 fatty acids/fish consumption
and Type II diabetes

Long chain n-3 fatty acids such as eicosapentaenoic
acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) are
found in high concentrations in fish oil. Fish oil has
been shown to have a beneficial effect on insulin sen-
sitivity in rats [10]. In humans, studies have shown an
association between the proportion of long-chain n-3
fatty acids in skeletal muscle membrane phospholip-
ids and increased insulin sensitivity [7, 9]. Because in-
take of fish oil directly influences the fatty acid com-

position of membrane phospholipids [10], these ob-
servations suggest that a higher intake of long chain
n-3 fatty acids could be beneficial for insulin sensitiv-
ity.

Fewer studies have examined the effects of fish oil
on glucose homeostasis and insulin resistance among
subjects without clinical diabetes and the available
data are not conclusive on the effects of fish oil on in-
sulin resistance [52, 53]. A recent 3-month study
found that addition of n-3 fatty acids to the diet had
no influence on insulin sensitivity or insulin secretion
[22]. But further long-term data are clearly needed.
In contrast, other beneficial effects of long chain n-3
fatty acids are better established, including improve-
ment of endothelial function, reductions in platelet
aggregation and serum triglyceride concentrations
and anti-arrhythmic effects [54]. Some of these ef-
fects are directly or indirectly related to insulin resis-
tance or the metabolic syndrome.

In observational studies, it is more feasible to ex-
amine the association between long-term intake of
fish oils and glucose intolerance and Type II diabetes.
Unfortunately, epidemiologic data on intake of fish
and n-3 fatty acids in relation to risk of diabetes are
sparse. In a study of 175 elderly men and women (59
cases), an inverse association was observed between
consumption of small amounts of fish and incidence
of glucose intolerance (impaired glucose tolerance
and diabetes combined) [51]. After adjustment for
age and other risk factors (but not physical activity),
the odds ratio for glucose intolerance was 0.47 (95 %
CI, 0.23±0.93) for participants consuming any fish
(mean daily intake 24.2 g). Consistent with this find-
ing, an inverse association between an increase in
fish consumption during 20 years and 2-h postload
glucose concentrations was seen among 338 partici-
pants of the Dutch and Swedish cohorts of the Seven
countries study [44]. Recently, the Nurses' Health
study reported a modest inverse association between
fish consumption and the incidence of Type II diabe-

810

B. Hu et al.: Diet and Type II diabetes

tes with 14 years of follow-up, but no clear trend over
the categories of intake was observed [40]. In a 10-
year follow-up study, the proportion of n-3 fatty acids
in serum cholesterol esters was not associated with
risk of diabetes [23]. In the San Luis Valley Diabetes
study, intake of long-chain n-3 fatty acids was not as-
sociated with fasting plasma insulin concentrations
[32]. Taken together, available evidence suggests a
possible benefit of long-chain n-3 fatty acids for
Type II diabetes, but the data are limited and incon-
sistent.

Trans-fatty acids in relation to insulin sensitivity
and Type II diabetes

Trans-fatty acids are formed when vegetable or fish
oils are hardened by partial hydrogenation. Metabol-
ic studies have shown that trans-fatty acids as com-
pared with cis unsaturated fatty acids, increase con-
centrations of LDL cholesterol and decrease concen-
trations of HDL cholesterol [55, 56]. The observation
that trans-fat inhibits the activity of desaturase en-
zymes has raised the hypothesis that trans-fat could
also affect insulin sensitivity, as indices of delta-5 de-
saturase activity were associated with higher insulin
sensitivity [7]. However, few studies have examined
the effects of trans-fat on glucose metabolism.

In a 6-week intervention study, a diet high in trans-
monounsaturated fat (20 % of energy) was associated
with a higher postprandial insulin response than a cis-
monounsaturated fat diet in 16 obese patients with
Type II diabetes [57]. In a study of 14 healthy women,
a 4-week diet with a lower trans-fat content (5.1 % of
energy) did not result in differences in glucose or in-
sulin response as compared with the diet with cis-
monounsaturated fat [58]. In the Nurses' Health
study, a high intake of trans-fatty acids was associated
with a higher risk of Type II diabetes during 14 years
of follow-up [40]. After adjustment for BMI and oth-
er types of fat, the relative risk of diabetes was 1.31
(95 % CI, 1.10±1.56) comparing the highest quintile
of intake (median 2.9 % energy) with the lowest quin-
tile (median 1.3 % energy). In continuous analysis,
each increase of 2 % of energy from trans-fatty acids
was associated with a 39 % (95 % CI, 15 %±67%) in-
crease in diabetes risk. This association could repre-
sent yet another adverse health effect of trans-fat.

Dietary carbohydrate and Type II diabetes

Classifications of carbohydrates. As with dietary fat,
dietary carbohydrates are not homogeneous with re-
gard to chemical structure and biologic functions.
Traditionally, carbohydrates are classified into simple
or complex carbohydrates on the basis of chemical
structures. Most dietary recommendations have em-

phasized the use of complex carbohydrates or starch-
es and the avoidance of simple carbohydrates or sug-
ars based on the belief that simple sugars would be di-
gested and absorbed more quickly and thus would in-
duce a more rapid postprandial glucose response. Nu-
merous metabolic studies have challenged this view
and it is now recognized that many starchy foods
such as baked potatoes and white bread produce
even higher glycaemic responses than do simple sug-
ars [59]. To quantify different glycaemic responses in-
duced by different carbohydrate foods, the concept of
glycaemic index (GI) was developed [60±62]. The in-
dex is based on the increase in blood glucose concen-
trations (the area under the curve for blood glucose
concentrations) after the ingestion of 50 g of carbohy-
drate from a test food as compared with a standard
amount (50 g) of reference carbohydrate (glucose or
white bread). The GI depends largely on the rate of
digestion and rapidity of absorption of carbohydrate
[63±65].

Despite the conceptual appeal of GI, the clinical
utility of GI, especially as it pertains to mixed meals,
remains controversial. Several earlier studies found
no differences in glycaemic responses to mixed meals
with different GIs among patients with Type II diabe-
tes or healthy subjects [66±68]. These studies, howev-
er, have been criticized for not following standard
methodology in calculating the glycaemic response
to a meal [69]. Studies using standardized methodolo-
gy have found an excellent correlation between the
observed GI values of mixed meals and the calculated
values based on individual component foods [70, 71].
Also, in controlled clinical studies [69], feeding low
GI meals to patients with Type II diabetes or dislipi-
demia has improved glycaemic control and the lipid
profile (especially reduction in triglyceride concen-
trations).

The GI concept and insulin resistance in feeding stud-
ies. Several animal studies have tested the effects of
different types of starch in the development of insulin
resistance and found that rats fed an amylopectin diet
became more insulin resistant than did littermates
that were fed an isocaloric diet with amylose [72]. The
mechanism underlying these observations is not fully
understood but could be directly related to persistent
postprandial hyperinsulinaemia and hyperglycaemia
resulting from a high GI diet. It is also possible that a
high GI diet chronically increases insulin demand and
in the long run, leads to pancreatic exhaustion.

The acute effects of low-GI diets as compared with
high-GI diets on plasma insulin concentrations and
C-peptide concentrations have been studied exten-
sively in humans. Most of the studies showed a lower
insulin response with a low GI meal. In a study of
eight healthy subjects [70], there were substantial dif-
ferences in insulin responses to six mixed meals with
various GI values, and insulin response correlated

B. Hu et al.: Diet and Type II diabetes

811

well with the glycaemic response (r = 0.83). Similarly,
it was found that GI values were useful in discrimi-
nating glycaemic and insulinaemic responses of
mixed meals among diabetic patients [73]. A recent
crossover study of 12 obese teenage boys found that
a low GI meal led to lower plasma glucose and insulin
response [74].

Several metabolic studies have evaluated the rela-
tively long-term effects of low-GI diets. In a cross-
over study of six healthy adults over 4 weeks [75], a
low-GI diet reduced 24-h urinary C-peptide concen-
trations by 32 % as compared with a high-GI diet,
whereas
serum fructosamine concentrations de-
creased by 7 %. In a 4-week study of 30 patients with
CHD [76], a low-GI diet improved glucose tolerance
and insulin sensitivity. Insulin-stimulated glucose up-
take in isolated fat cells was greater following the
low-GI diet. The same group subsequently reported
an improvement in insulin sensitivity, as determined
by the short insulin tolerance test, with a low-GI diet
among 28 premenopausal women in a 3-week ran-
domized study [77]. Studies conducted among diabet-
ic patients have also found improved glycaemic con-
trol with a low-GI diet [61, 78].

Epidemiologic studies of the GI concept and metabol-
ic markers and Type II diabetes. In epidemiologic
studies, a dietary GI is typically calculated by multi-
plying the percentage of total carbohydrate intake
contributed by each individual carbohydrate-contain-
ing food by its GI and summing these values. Two
large national surveys, one conducted in the United
Kingdom [79] and the other in the United States
[80], found a statistically significant inverse associa-
tion between calculated overall dietary GI values
and plasma HDL concentrations in free-living adults.
However, in a study of 394 Dutch men aged 64 to
84 years [81], no association was observed between
dietary GI and HDL, hyperglycaemia or hyperinsu-
linaemia.

The overall blood glucose response is determined
not only by GI value of a food, but also by the amount
of carbohydrate in the food. Thus, the concept of gly-
caemic load (GL) (the product of the GI value of a
food and its carbohydrate content) has been devel-
oped to represent both the quality and quantity of
the carbohydrates consumed [45, 82]. Each unit of di-
etary GL represents the equivalent glycaemic effect
of 1 g of carbohydrate from white bread, which is
used as the reference food. Table 2 shows GI and
GL values for selected common foods [83] (The serv-
ing sizes and carbohydrate contents are from the U S
Department of Agriculture [84]). Foods with high
GI values as well as a high carbohydrate content,
such as low-amylose white rice and baked potatoes,
have the highest GL values. The GL concept could
be more biologically relevant than the individual GI
values because, by taking into account both quality

and quantity of carbohydrates, the GL represents the
overall ability of a food or diet to raise the blood glu-
cose concentration. In a subsample of the Nurses'
Health study [85], the positive association with fast-
ing triglycerides and the inverse association with plas-
ma concentration of HDL appeared to be stronger
for dietary GL than for overall GI. Furthermore, the
effects of GL were more pronounced among over-
weight and obese women than among lean women.

An important test of the clinical usefulness of the
GI concept depends on whether it predicts long-
term disease risk, especially the incidence of Type II
diabetes. The influence of type and quality of Type
II diabetes on risk of Type II diabetes received little
attention in epidemiologic studies until recently. Sev-
eral epidemiologic studies examined total amount of
carbohydrate and traditional classifications of carbo-
hydrates in relation to hyperglycaemia or risk of dia-
betes (Table 1) [36, 39, 45, 86, 87]. In general, neither
total carbohydrate nor intake of simple sugars such
as sucrose intake predicted risk of diabetes. Recently,
three large cohort studies examined the association
between dietary GL and incidence of Type II diabe-
tes. In the Health Professionals' Follow-up Study
[45] and Nurses' Health Study [82], the incidence of
diabetes increased with higher GL especially in com-
bination with low intake of cereal fiber. In the Nurses'
Health study [82], the RR of Type II diabetes was
2.50 (95 % CI, 1.14±5.51) for women with the combi-
nation with a high GL and a low cereal fiber intake
compared with the opposite extreme. Similar results
were obtained from the Health Professionals' fol-
low-up study [45]. In a recent analysis of the Iowa
Women's Health study [87], however, no overall asso-
ciation was observed for either dietary GI or GL. But
in this cohort, diet was assessed at only one point in
time and the diagnosis of diabetes was based entirely
on self-reports on the questionnaire without further
confirmation.

In a recent analysis, a strong positive association
between GL and risk of CHD was observed in the
Nurses' Health study [88]. The RR (highest quintile
vs.
lowest quintile of GL) was 1.98 (95 % CI,
1.41±2.77). The increased risk was more pronounced
among overweight and obese women, suggesting
that the adverse effects of a high GL diet are proba-
bly aggravated by underlying insulin resistance.

Glycaemic index and obesity. Obesity (particularly
abdominal adiposity) is a major cause of Type II dia-
betes. A purported benefit of a low-fat diet is weight
loss. But the association between dietary fat and obe-
sity is not clear [89] and long-term clinical trials have
not provided convincing evidence that reducing di-
etary fat can lead to substantial weight loss [90]. On
the other hand, cumulative evidence from experi-
mental studies suggests a potential role of a high-GI
diet on the development of obesity [91, 92]. In animal

studies, high-GI diets as compared with isocaloric
low-GI diets induce an increase in fat synthesis even
when the total body weight remains constant [72]. A
recent review showed that consumption of low-GI
foods or liquids was directly associated with reduc-
tion in subsequent hunger and/or increased satiety in
most of the short-term feeding studies in humans
[92]. In addition, voluntary energy intake increased
after consumption of high-GI meals as compared
with consumption of low-GI meals [92]. These obser-
vations suggest that long-term consumption of high-
GI diets could promote excess energy consumption
and thus contribute to weight gain or to the mainte-
nance of excess body weight, especially among sus-
ceptible subjects (e. g., sedentary or overweight sub-
jects) [91]. To date, no long-term studies have tested
the effects of GI on weight control.

Whole grain consumption and risk of Type II diabetes

Whole grain products such as whole wheat breads,
brown rice, oats, and barley tend to produce slower
glycaemic and insulinaemic responses than do highly
processed refined grains. Whole grains are also rich
in fiber, antioxidant vitamins, magnesium, and phyto-
chemicals. Two large prospective cohort studies of
women have found an inverse association between
whole grain consumption and risk of diabetes and
CHD. In the Iowa Women's Health study [87], the
RR of self-reported diabetes comparing women in
the highest (median, 20.5 servings/week) versus low-
est quintiles (median, 1 serving/week) of whole grain
intake was 0.79 (95 % CI, 0.65±0.96; p for
trend = 0.009). The lower risk with higher intake of
whole grains was independent of fiber or several oth-
er constituents of whole grains. This inverse associa-
tion was confirmed in the Nurses' Health study [93];
after adjustment for age, BMI, physical activity, and
other covariates, the RR of diabetes comparing ex-
treme quintiles of whole grain consumption (medi-
ans, 2.7 servings/day in the fifth quintile vs 0.13 serv-
ing/day in lowest quintile) was 0.73 (95 % CI,
0.63±0.85; p for trend < 0.0001). In contrast, a higher
consumption of refined grains (including sweet rolls,
cakes, desserts, white bread, muffins, white rice, piz-
za, pancakes or waffles, refined-grain breakfast cere-
als) was associated with an increased risk of diabetes
in the analysis adjusted for age and total energy in-
take, although the RR was attenuated after further
adjustment for BMI. The ratio of whole grain to re-
fined grain was related to a lower risk of diabetes,
suggesting a potential benefit of replacing refined
grains with whole grains. Whole grain consumption
has also been inversely associated with risk of CHD
[94, 95] and ischemic stroke [96].

Fiber consumption and risk of Type II diabetes

Summary and Conclusions

Dietary fiber includes the cell walls of plants and oth-
er indigestable components of plants. Soluble fibers
(pectins, gums, mucilages, and psyllium) lower total
and LDL cholesterol through increased bile acid ex-
cretion and decreased hepatic synthesis of cholesterol
and fatty acids [97, 98], although the cholesterol-low-
ering effects are modest [99]. In addition, a high-fiber
diet has been shown to improve glycaemic control
and insulin response [98, 100]. In the Coronary Ar-
tery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA)
study [101], a lower fiber consumption predicted
higher fasting insulin concentrations and greater
weight gain independent of dietary intake of total
and saturated fats. Foods with intact grain cereals or
a high content of viscous fiber tend to have low GI
values. The correlation between dietary fiber and GI
is modest (r = 0.46) and only 21 % of GI variability
in 25 tested foods could be explained by the dietary
fiber content [102]. This suggests the relative inde-
pendence of the GI concept and dietary fiber.

So far, three prospective cohort studies have ob-
served an inverse association between dietary fiber
consumption and risk of Type II diabetes [45, 82, 87].
In all of these studies, cereal fiber appeared to contrib-
ute most to the protective effect. For example, in the
Nurses' Health study [82], the RR of diabetes compar-
ing extreme quintiles of cereal fiber intake was 0.72
(95 % CI, 0.58±0.90; p for trend = 0.001). The corre-
sponding RRs were 0.87 (95 % CI, 0.70±1.08) for fruit
fiber and 1.17 (95 % CI, 0.93±1.46) for vegetable fiber.
Similar results were obtained from the Health Profes-
sionals' follow-up study [45]. These results are consis-
tent with the studies that showed a stronger inverse as-
sociation between cereal fiber and CHD than for fruit
or vegetable fiber [103±106].

It is not clear why cereal fiber could exert more ben-
eficial effects than other sources of fiber. A study hy-
pothesized that the protective effect of cereal fiber
could be mediated by increased concentration of mag-
nesium and antioxidant vitamins in fiber-rich cereal
products [107]. However, fruits and vegetables also
contain a myriad of potentially cardioprotective com-
pounds. Nevertheless, confounding by other nutrients
such as magnesium and antioxidant vitamins that are
concentrated in minimally-processed grain products
cannot be ruled out. Recently, it was found [108] that
fiber from whole grain, but not refined grain, was in-
versely associated with all-cause mortality in the
Iowa Women's Health study and the study attributed
the association to the presence of ªnutrient-richº fiber
in whole grains. While research efforts should contin-
ue to investigate the biologic effects of different types
and sources of fiber, from the point of view of the pub-
lic health, an increase in total dietary fiber from differ-
ent food sources (especially whole grains, fruits, vege-
tables, legumes, and nuts) should be encouraged.

Although it is generally agreed that dietary modifica-
tion is an important means of preventing Type II dia-
betes, there exists no general consensus about the
roles of dietary fat and carbohydrates. The findings
of this review indicate that neither total fat nor total
carbohydrate as proportions of total energy play a
major part in the development of Type II diabetes in
humans but that different types of fat and carbohy-
drates appear to be more important. In particular, a
higher intake of polyunsaturated fat and possibly
long-chain n-3 fatty acids could be beneficial, where-
as a higher intake of saturated fat and trans-fat could
adversely affect glucose metabolism. In dietary prac-
tice, exchanging nonhydrogenated polyunsaturated
fat for saturated and trans-fatty acids could apprecia-
bly reduce risk of Type II diabetes. In addition, a low-
GI diet with a greater amount of fiber and minimally
processed whole grain products seems to improve
glycaemic and insulinaemic responses and lower the
risk of Type II diabetes. Evidence indicates that the
traditional concept of ªsimpleº versus ªcomplexº car-
bohydrates is not useful in predicting the risk of Type
II diabetes.

The clinical utility of the GI remains controversial.
It is either dismissed as irrelevant indicators [109] or
embraced as a sole yardstick to classify ªgoodº or
ªbadº foods, especially in popular diets. Current evi-
dence indicates that the GI is a useful concept, al-
though the GI database needs to be further devel-
oped and refined, particularly in different popula-
tions and in the context of mixed meals. Long-term
studies on the GI concept and weight control are ur-
gently needed. Future epidemiologic studies on the
association between dietary GL and the risk of Type
II diabetes should include major factors that are like-
ly to influence the GI value of a food, such as the ratio
of amylose to amylopectin and cooking methods
(e. g., baked vs. boiled potatoes) in the dietary assess-
ment. Repeated measures of diet are necessary in or-
der to assess long-term dietary patterns and reduce
measurement errors because of within-person varia-
tions. Large sample sizes and long-term follow-up
are needed to obtain more robust results. In dietary
practice, GI values are probably most useful for se-
lecting foods that contain a high amount of carbohy-
drate, especially starchy foods, but they have limited
use for ranking fruits and vegetables and other foods
containing small amounts of carbohydrate. In evalu-
ating health effects of individual foods, GI values
should never be used in isolation; nutrient composi-
tion of the foods and overall dietary patterns are
clearly important.

The most important way to lower the risk of Type
II diabetes is to avoid overweight and obesity by en-
gaging in regular physical activity and balancing total
energy intake with energy expenditure. In addition,

available evidence suggest that modifying types of fat
and carbohydrates in the diet is likely to improve in-
sulin response and lower risk of Type II diabetes, al-
though other dietary components such as magnesium
could also play a role [87]. In particular, substituting
unhydrogenated unsaturated fats (such as those in
natural vegetable oils, nuts, and seeds) for saturated
fat (such as those in animal products) and trans-fat
(such as those in vegetable shortening and hard mar-
garine) could substantially lower risk of Type II dia-
betes as well as other chronic diseases. Substituting
minimally processed whole grain products for refined
grains would also have substantial benefits on these
diseases. Instead of simply recommending a low-fat
high-carbohydrate diet, current dietary recommenda-
tions for patients with diabetes have emphasized the
importance of individualizing the percent of calories
from fat and carbohydrate based on clinical goals
[110, 111]. Clearly, dietary recommendations to pre-
vent and manage Type II diabetes should focus more
on the quality of fat and carbohydrate in the diet
than quantity alone, in addition to total energy bal-
ance.
