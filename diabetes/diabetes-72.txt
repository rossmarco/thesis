Background: Observational studies and meta-analyses suggested that increased total fruits
and vegetables consumption have a protective role in incidence of type 2 diabetes melli-
tus (T2DM). However, we still don’t know whether the subtypes, such as citrus fruits and
cruciferous vegetables (CV), have a preventive role.
Methods: We systematically searched the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases up to December
31, 2014. Summary relative risks (SRRs) and 95% conﬁdence intervals (CIs) were calculated
using random-effects models.
Results: Seven distinct prospective cohort studies (ﬁve articles) were identiﬁed for this study.
A total of 16,544 incident cases of type 2 diabetes were ascertained among 306,723 par-
ticipants with follow-up periods ranging from 4.6 to 24 years. Based on four prospective
cohort studies, we found that overall, consumption of CV had a protective role in the T2DM
incidence (highest vs. lowest analysis: SRR = 0.84, 95% CI: 0.73 to 0.96), with evidence of signif-
icant heterogeneity (P = 0.09, I2 = 54.4%). This association was independent of the main risk
factors for cardiovascular disease: smoking, alcohol use, BMI, and physical activity etc. Con-
sumption of citrus fruits did not have a protective role in the T2DM development (highest vs.
lowest analysis: SRR = 1.02, 95% CI: 0.96 to 1.08), with no evidence of signiﬁcant heterogeneity
(P = 0.49, I2 = 0).
Conclusions: Higher consumption of CV, but not citrus fruits, is associated with a signiﬁcantly
decreased risk of type 2 diabetes. Further large prospective studies are needed to elucidate
both relationships.

Introduction

Over the past two decades, the prevalence of type 2 diabetes
mellitus (T2DM) has been elevated markedly worldwide [1].

Studies have shown that increased exercise, quit smoking,
weight lost among obese individuals, adoption of a diet rich
in ﬁber may reduce the incidence of T2DM [2,3].

Dietary factors are potential risk factors, but the rela-
tionship between fruit and vegetable intake and incidence

of T2DM is not fully understood. Although a meta-analysis
published in 2010, which included six prospective cohort stud-
ies, reported that greater intake of fruits was not associated
with risk of T2DM [Summary relative risk (SRR) = 0.93, 95%
conﬁdence interval (CI): 0.83 to 1.01] [4], the updated two
meta-analyses, which included 10 prospective cohort stud-
ies, found a protective role for fruit intake [5,6]. Furthermore,
a signiﬁcantly inverse association between citrus fruits con-
sumption and risk of T2DM was observed among one cohort of
Chinese women with intermediate levels of citrus consump-
tion (10.0–25.2 g/day) as compared to low citrus consumption,
but no signiﬁcant association was found for a high intake
(median, 44.4 g/day) [7]. Others, studies from USA and Europe
found a non-signiﬁcant association between citrus consump-
tion and risk of T2DM [8–10]. Likewise, mixed results were
reported for the association between CV consumption and
T2DM [7,8,9,10]. Like other fruits, both citrus fruits and CV
contain many nutrients, such as carotenoids, polyphenols,
ﬂavonoids, limonoids, folic acid, and dietary ﬁber, which are
believed to delay the digestion and absorption of carbohy-
drates and suppress postprandial glycemia, oxidative stress,
and low-grade inﬂammation [10]. Importantly, CVs are unique
in that they are rich sources of glucosinolates [11,12], the
precursors of isothiocyanates and indole-3-carbinol [13,14].
Researches have observed a protective role of isothiocyanate
in the development of DM via improved glucose tolerance and
insulin signaling [15]. In addition, researches [16,17] have indi-
cated that extract of citrus fruits has hypoglycemic effects in
the diabetic experimental models.

In this meta-analysis, we focused on only prospective
cohort studies due to the following: (1) no systematic reviews
and meta-analyses have looked at the effects of intake of citrus
fruits and CV on the overall risk of T2DM. (2) Both case-control
and cross-sectional designs are subjected to the selection and
recall bias, and the prospective evidences on these associa-
tions have been reported with inconsistent results [7–10,18]. (3)
Only several clinical trials investigate the effects of intakes of
citrus [19] and CV [20,21] on the development of complications
in patients with T2DM, but not the development of T2DM.
Therefore, to better characterize this issue, we conducted a
meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies to evaluate such
relationships following the meta-analysis of observational
studies in epidemiology (MOOSE) [22].

Methods

2.1.

Search strategy

For this meta-analysis, searches were performed electron-
ically through the MEDLINE and EMBASE database for
prospective cohort studies examining the association between
citrus fruits and CV intake and risk of T2DM. We supple-
mented this search by hand-searching the reference lists of
the retrieved articles. The search strategy used the follow-
ing terms of Medical Subject Headings or keywords: (1) fruit
OR citrus OR grapefruit OR orange OR tangerine OR lemon
OR lime OR cruciferous vegetables OR brassica OR broccoli
OR cauliﬂower OR cabbage; (2) diabetes OR hyper glucose OR
hyperglycemia OR NIDDM; (3) risk OR incidence OR prevalence.

Searches included the earliest available online indexing year
up to December 31, 2014, with no language restrictions. Two
investigators (J.X.J. and Z.L.N.) did this literature search.

2.2.

Study selection

Two researchers (J.X.J. and Z.L.N.) independently reviewed all
potentially relevant articles to determine whether an article
met the general inclusion criteria, and any discrepancy was
solved by consultation of a third investigator (S.S.Q.). To be
included, studies had to: (1) have a prospective cohort design;
(2) evaluate the association between citrus fruits and/or CV
consumption and the development of T2DM; (3) point esti-
mates of relative risk (RR) with 95% CIs or standard errors
available or derivable; and 4) report the associations at least
adjusted by age. Studies on pregnant women or children
(≤18 y) were excluded. Animal studies, in vitro researches,
case reports, ecological studies and reviews were not consid-
ered eligible. We also excluded studies which reported risk
association for type 1 diabetes. If data were duplicated in more
than one studies, we included the most recent or informative
ones.

2.3.

Data extraction

Two researchers (J.X.J. and Z.L.N.) extracted the following
information independently and in duplicate: basic informa-
tion (author, publication year), study characteristics (name
of the study, study design, country, duration of follow-up,
and number of participants and incident cases), participant
characteristics (age and sex), exposure (intake levels for each
category) and dietary assessment method, outcome (type 2
diabetes) ascertainment, analytic comparison, RR estimates
and 95% CIs for each incremental category of intake, and
covariates included in the models. From each study, we
extracted the risk estimates adjusted for the greatest number
of potential confounders, as suggested by Chene et al. [23]. For
one study [18] that included data from three cohorts, we con-
sidered the analysis for each cohort as an independent report
and extracted data separately.

2.4.

Quality assessment for individual studies

The quality of each study was evaluated according to the
Newcastle–Ottawa quality assessment scale (NOS) [24], which
assigns a maximum of 9 points for quality assessment. NOS
use three quality parameters for cohort studies: selection
(4 points), comparability (2 points), and outcome (3 points)
assessment. A total score of ≥7 points is indicative of high-
quality studies; score of ≤6 points of low-quality studies.
Studies that could not be evaluated by NOS because of insuf-
ﬁcient information were considered to be low-quality studies.
Two reviewers (J.X.J. and Z.L.N.) carried out the quality assess-
ment independently.

2.5.

Statistical analysis

We used the method of a random-effects model to calculate
the summary RR estimations and 95% CIs of T2DM for the
highest vs. lowest level of intake. This method was developed

274

p r i m a r y c a r e d i a b e t e s 1 0 ( 2 0 1 6 ) 272–280

by Der Simonian and Laird, which accounts for heterogeneity
among studies [25]. We produced forest plots to assess the
multivariate adjusted relative risks and corresponding 95% CIs
visually across studies.

In heterogeneity tests, we used the Cochrane Q statistic (we
considered P < 0.10 to be indicative of statistically signiﬁcant
heterogeneity) and I2 statistics, which were interpreted as the
percentage of total variation across studies owing to hetero-
geneity. I2 value of greater than 50% was considered to have
signiﬁcant heterogeneity, and I2 value of less than 25% have no
signiﬁcant heterogeneity [26]. To investigate potential sources
of heterogeneity, we conducted subgroup analysis by sex, geo-
graphic location (USA, China and European population), mean
follow-up duration (≤11.7 vs. >11.7 years), mean number of
cases, methods of exposure assessment and adjustment for
covariates, including a history of hypertension, family history
of DM, education and dietary factors. For sensitivity analysis,
we ﬁrstly used the ﬁxed-effects model for the overall analyses.
Additional sensitivity analyses were performed by omitting
one study at a time and calculating a pooled estimate for the
remainder of the studies to evaluate whether the results were
affected markedly by a single study.

Publication bias was evaluated by using the Egger’s regres-
sion test, Begg’s adjusted rank correlation test and funnel plot
[27,28]. P values were two sided with a signiﬁcance level of 0.05.
All statistical analyses were performed with Stata Statistical
Software, version 11.0 (STATA, College Station, TX, USA).

Search results

The search strategy generated 1439 citations (Fig. 1). We
assessed titles and abstracts and 23 were considered of
potential value and the full text was retrieved for detailed
evaluation. Eighteen of these 23 articles were subsequently
excluded from the meta-analysis for various reasons. No addi-
tional articles were included from reference review. So, a total

of 5 publications with 7 prospective cohort studies were used
in this meta-analysis [7–10,18]. Of these, the Nurses’ Health
Study (NHS) I, II and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study
(HPFS) were included in one article [18].

3.2.

Study characteristics

Table 1 showed the study characteristics and main outcomes
of the included studies. Four studies (two publications) were
undertaken in the USA [8,18], two from European countries
[9,10] and the remainder in China [7]. The combined pop-
ulation resulted in 306,723 study participants; four studies
included only women, two studies included only men and one
study include both men and women. The age of participants
ranged from 24 to 74 years. The methods of exposure assess-
ment were based on validated Food Frequency Questionnaire
(FFQ) in the 6 studies, and food recording in the remaining one
[10]. Only one study used interviewer-administered FFQ [7],
ﬁve studies (three publications) used self-administered FFQ
[8,18], and one used a combination of self- and interviewer-
administered FFQ [9]. T2DM was ascertained by a combination
of self-reported information and plasma glucose measure-
ments in all the 7 studies. After the median duration of
follow-up of 11.7 years (range: 4.6–24 yrs), 16,544 incident
T2DM cases were identiﬁed.

All studies were controlled for age, body mass index, alco-
hol intake, tobacco smoking, total energy intake and physical
activity. The majority (n = 5 studies) made additional adjust-
ments for a family history of diabetes [8,10,18]. Adjustments
for a history of hypertension were made in only 2 studies
[7,8]. Adjustment for socio-economic status, which can be an
important confounder of dietary intake, was performed in 3
studies by using educational level [7,9,10]. However, no studies
presented RRs adjusted by dyslipidemia.

According to NOS, all studies were of high quality (NOS
>6). The most common selection bias was the under-
representation of the study participants.

3.3.

Citrus fruits consumption

A meta-analysis of the six studies (four publications) showed
that higher intake of citrus fruits was not associated with a sig-
niﬁcant risk of T2DM. The summary RR (95% CI) in individuals
with the highest level of citrus intake compared with those
with the lowest levels was 1.02 (95% CI: 0.96 to 1.08). There
was no evidence of heterogeneity (Q = 4.46, P = 0.49, I2 = 0). In
the overall model, no single study contributed a disproportion-
ate amount of statistical inﬂuence: the relative weights ranged
from 8.12% in the NHS-II to 31.46% in the NHS (Fig. 2A).

3.4.

CV consumption

A meta-analysis of the four studies showed that higher intake
of CV was associated with a decreased risk of T2DM. The
summary RR (95% CI) in individuals with the highest level of
CV intake compared with those with the lowest levels was
0.84(95% CI: 0.73 to 0.96) for CV intake, with evidence of het-
erogeneity (Q = 6.58, P = 0.09, I2 = 54.4%; Fig. 2B).

Subgroup and sensitivity analyses

Subgroup analyses were shown in Table 2. For citrus fruits con-
sumption, four cohort studies reported data speciﬁcally for
women, with the SRR of 1.05 (95% CI: 0.97 to 1.13). Meta-
analysis of four studies conducted in the USA showed a
non-signiﬁcant risk association (SRR = 1.00, 95% CI: 0.93 to
1.08). Four cohort studies (two publications) used a self-
administered FFQ to evaluate dietary intake [7,18], and a
meta-analysis of these 4 studies showed a non-signiﬁcantly
risk association (SRR = 1.01, 95% CI: 0.92 to 1.10). A stratiﬁed
analysis according to duration of follow-up yielded a SRR of
1.06 (95% CI, 0.97–1.17) for studies with duration of follow-up
≤11.7 years and 0.98(95% CI, 0.90–1.07) for studies with dura-
tion of follow-up >11.7 years.

We conducted the same type of analysis for CV consump-
tion. Two cohort studies reported data speciﬁcally for women,
with the SRR of 0.83 (95% CI: 0.63 to 1.08). None of the con-
founders showed signiﬁcant effects on the risk association

between citrus fruits and CV consumption and T2DM risk
(Table 2).

Sensitivity analyses using a ﬁxed-effects model showed an
equal risk association between citrus fruits and CV consump-
tion and T2DM risk. The calculation of overall homogeneity
and effect size by removing one study at a time from the anal-
ysis conﬁrmed the stability of the association between citrus
fruits and CV consumption and T2DM risk (data not shown).

Publication bias

We observed no asymmetry in our funnel plot (Fig. 3A–B)
among studies that analyzed citrus and CV consumption and
T2DM incidence, and the further Begg’s (P = 0.71 for citrus and
1.00 for CV) and Egger’s regression test (P = 0.59 for citrus and
1.00 for CV) did not indicate the presence of publication bias.
This assessment, however, was based on only 6 studies for
citrus consumption and 4 studies for CV consumption.

Discussion

In this meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies, we inves-
tigated the association between citrus and CV consumption
and T2DM incidence. We found that consumption of CV had
a protective role in the T2DM incidence. This association was
independent of the main risk factors for cardiovascular dis-
ease: smoking, alcohol use, BMI, and physical activity etc.
Consumption of citrus fruits did not have a protective role in
the T2DM development.

Several laboratory studies might explain an inverse associ-
ation between intake of cruciferous vegetables and T2DM. Like
other vegetables, CV is rich sources of ﬁber, vitamin C, vitamin
E, folate, carotenoids, ﬂavonoids and minerals (potassium and
magnesium). A recent meta-analysis of the prospective stud-
ies showed that a 100 mg/d increase in dietary magnesium
intake reduced the risk of incident diabetes by 14% (RR = 0.86,
95% CI: 0.82 to 0.89) [29]. Additionally, recent meta-analyses
demonstrated that dietary intake of ﬁber and ﬂavonoids was
inversely associated with the incidence of diabetes [30,31].
Importantly, CVs are unique in that they are rich sources of
glucosinolates [11,12], the precursors of isothiocyanates and
indole-3-carbinol [13,14]. Animal researches have observed
that isothiocyanate may help prevent DM via improved glu-
cose tolerance and insulin signaling [15]. In addition, C57BL/6L
mice supplemented with isothiocyanate had reduced plasma
insulin, leptin, resistin, cholesterol, IL-1beta, TNFalpha, and
lower hepatic glucose-6-phosphatase (G6P) expression [15,32].
Although the current meta-analysis observed a non-
signiﬁcant risk association between citrus fruits consumption
and T2DM risk, the nutrients contained in the citrus fruits are
indicated to have a beneﬁcial role in the prevention of T2DM
[29,33]. It is well known that citrus are low in energy, and
contain a variety of ﬁber, vitamins C, carotenoids, ﬂavonoids,
limonoids, folic acid, and minerals (potassium and magne-
sium). Inﬂammation has been linked to the risk of diabetes
and heart disease [34]. Evidence suggests that citrus fruits may
signiﬁcantly lower inﬂammation markers including CRP and
IL-6 [35,36]. In addition, animal studies have indicated extract
of citrus fruits showed signiﬁcant reduction of fasting blood
glucose and hepatic glucose levels while hepatic glycogen
signiﬁcantly increased when compared to diabetic control ani-
mals [16,17,37]. All these evidences indicate that citrus might
have a potential role in T2DM prevention, although the current
epidemiological evidence may not support these ﬁndings.

The strengths of our study include the use of prospective
studies with large sample size, long-term follow-up (median,
11.7 years), and extensive adjustments for known poten-
tial confounders in the analyses, which together could avoid
inverse causation bias and selection bias. Additionally, both
dietary exposures were ascertained through standardized and
validated questionnaires in all the included studies.

However, as a meta-analysis of observational studies, our
ﬁndings have several limitations. First, our analysis is limited
to data from relatively few countries (USA, European and
China); the majority of studies (6/7) that have examined
citrus fruits and CV intake were drawn from cohorts of
Western participants and only one was drawn from cohort
of China [7]. Thus, we could not comprehensively assess

whether associations differ by geographic location or by cul-
tural/racial differences across populations. Likewise, we could
not comprehensively conduct the meta-analysis according to
subgroups (e.g., sex) due to the small number of studies. Only
the study from HPFS included men for citrus consumption and
KIHD for CV consumption, which observed no signiﬁcant ben-
eﬁts of higher intake of citrus fruit for T2DM prevention [18].
Further studies in men, especially in Eastern men, are required
before ﬁrm conclusions can be made.

Second, measurement errors are of a concern when we
perform the assessment of dietary intake and chronic dis-
ease risk [38,39]. It is very difﬁcult for persons to accurately
report their intake of citrus fruits or CV due to the following:
(1) Measurement error can occur if results based on different
intake units are reported. For instance, two studies used grams
per day to assess citrus intakes [7,9], while other three stud-
ies used servings per week [18] and one study used servings
per day [8]. Thus, we could not carry out an analysis of dose-
response association. (2) Among the included studies, only
the Nurses’ Health Study [18] had repeated dietary assess-
ment (every 4 years) during the follow-up period, while the
dietary assessment was only made at baseline in the other
studies. (3) All but one studies used the food frequency ques-
tionnaire to assess dietary intake and the remaining one used
food recording [10]. However, previous validated studies have
shown the relatively high correlations between food frequency
questionnaire and diet record assessments of individual veg-
etables and fruit consumption. For example, the correlation
coefﬁcients were 0.74 for oranges in women [40] and 0.76 in
men [41,42]. (4) Most of the cohort studies (4/7) included in our
meta-analysis used mailed questionnaires to assess dietary
intake, rather than interviewers administered questionnaires,
which is a more credible method. However, mailing FFQ to par-
ticipants was sometimes the strength of studies, especially
for the NHS and HPF, because participants of the two cohorts
were highly educated and mailing questionnaire would give
them enough time to accurately complete the questionnaires.
Therefore, measurement errors in the assessment of dietary
intake may have no substantial effects on such an association.
Third, although we were able to carefully adjust for known
dietary and lifestyle risk factors, unmeasured or uncontrolled
confounding remains a possibility because of the observa-
tional nature of this study. Individuals, who consume more
vegetables and fruits, including citrus fruits and CV, are more
likely to have other healthy behaviors, such as lower intakes of
red and processed meat, physical activity and a lower preva-
lence of alcohol use, tobacco smoking and overweight/obesity
[43,44]. All the included studies involved adjustments for the
above covariates, therefore, those confounders cannot be con-
sidered as limiting factors. In addition, it is of a particular
concern for confounding by socioeconomic status, which is
both a risk factor for T2DM and a predictor of vegetables and
fruits consumption in Asian and Western populations [45–47].
However, confounding by socioeconomic status was unlikely
to be substantial in the four US studies, which consisted of
participants from the same background (health professionals),
and in the remainder three studies [7,9,10], which controlled
for indicators of socioeconomic status such as income and
education. In addition, subgroup analysis according to edu-
cational status found no different effects on such association.

279

Nevertheless, residual confounding by socioeconomic status
cannot be completely excluded in these studies. For example,
dyslipidemia was an important risk factor for T2DM [48], how-
ever, no studies presented RRs adjusted by dyslipidemia. So,
to conﬁrm our ﬁndings, we need to carry out large scale pool-
ing projects, in which covariate adjustments and statistical
analysis can be standardized.

Finally, as in any meta-analysis, the possibility of publica-
tion bias is of concern because we did not attempt to uncover
unpublished studies and not include studies with insufﬁcient
information to estimate a summary risk estimate. However,
the results obtained from funnel plot analyses and statistical
tests did not provide evidence for such bias.

In summary, the present meta-analysis provided evidence
for an inverse association between CV consumption and risk of
T2DM. No signiﬁcant associations for citrus fruits consump-
tion were found. As the number of epidemiological studies
included in our meta-analysis was relatively small, further
large prospective studies, especially in eastern population, are
needed to elucidate this relationship.
