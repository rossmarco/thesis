among employees in South West England, UK and their differences by personal characteristics.

Method. A cross-sectional survey was conducted in 2014 among 590 adults (428 women, 162 men, mean age
43.8 years), employees of four work-place settings. Mediterranean diet adherence was assessed using a validated
food frequency questionnaire. Adherence differences were assessed by gender, marital status, education, number
of children and food shopping and preparation responsibility.

Results. On average, participants reported moderate adherence to the Mediterranean diet. Higher adherence
was reported for alcohol, vegetables, cereals and fruit. Few participants achieved high adherence to the
Mediterranean diet recommendations for legumes (5.3%), ﬁsh (3.2%), dairy products (4.8%), red meat (11.9%),
poultry (11.1%) and olive oil (18.2%). A higher Mediterranean diet score was reported among participants who
were married/cohabiting, those with higher education attainment and shared responsibility for food preparation.
Conclusion. Improvement in the consumption of several Mediterranean diet components is needed to in-
crease adherence in this sample of adults. The ﬁndings have the potential to inform the development of a
web-based intervention that will focus on these foods to promote the Mediterranean diet in work-place settings
in South West England.

Introduction

The importance of studying and promoting dietary patterns, instead
of isolated foods or nutrients, in order to increase the likelihood of ac-
ceptability and compliance with nutrition interventions, has been
established (Hu, 2002). The Mediterranean diet, rich in olive oil, fruits
and vegetables, including whole grains, legumes and nuts, low-fat
dairy, ﬁsh, moderate alcohol consumption and low quantities of red
meat, has been associated with a reduced risk of chronic disease inci-
dence and mortality in the general population (Soﬁ et al., 2014). This di-
etary pattern has been recognised as a model for healthy eating and the
need to promote it to non-Mediterranean populations has recently been
recognised (Council of the European Union, 2014; National Institute for
Health and Care Excellence, 2014). It has been suggested that its
high palatability makes the Mediterranean diet an attractive diet
to promote to Western populations (McManus et al., 2001; Willett,

2006). Components of this diet could be easily transferable to non-
Mediterranean populations (Renaud et al., 1995; McManus et al.,
2001) and therefore represent an opportunity to change dietary
behaviours.

The need to design nutrition behaviour change interventions based
on formative research has been emphasised (Kok et al., 2004; National
Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, 2007; Craig et al., 2008;
World Health Organisation, 2009). The conceptualisation and develop-
ment of such interventions should include the identiﬁcation of the evi-
dence and theory base, supplemented by a needs assessment phase,
where health problems in the target population are identiﬁed and be-
havioural risk factors for these problems are assessed (Kok et al.,
2004; Craig et al., 2008). Identifying the evidence, as well as the speciﬁc
needs of the target population is suggested to aid the development and
delivery of feasible and effective approaches to promote dietary behav-
iour change (National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, 2007;
Craig et al., 2008).

The internet is widely accessible to the general public and is one of
the most preferred sources of nutrition information (Horgan and
Sweeney, 2012). In the ﬁrst quarter of 2014, 87% of adults in the UK
had used the internet, supporting its potential as a cost-effective inter-
vention tool with large reach (Ofﬁce for National Statistics, 2014a).
Work-place settings provide mechanisms to promote dietary behaviour

change since they offer accessibility to large populations of adults who
can be surveyed repeatedly (Maes et al., 2011). Several web-based nu-
trition intervention studies have been conducted in work-place settings
(Block et al., 2004; Irvine et al., 2004; Oenema et al., 2005; Mills et al.,
2007; Robroek et al., 2007). The majority of work-place nutrition inter-
ventions have focussed on promoting changes in a limited number of
outcomes such as fruit, vegetable and fat consumption (Steyn et al.,
2009; Mhurchu et al., 2010). To our knowledge, only one small-scale,
web-based intervention has promoted the Mediterranean diet and
demonstrated favourable changes in several components of this dietary
pattern among healthy employees in Scotland (Papadaki and Scott,
2005a, 2005b, 2008). However, this study was conducted only among
female employees, thus not allowing the generalizability of the ﬁndings
to male participants or the exploration of potential gender differences in
Mediterranean diet adherence. In addition, this earlier work did not
conduct formative research prior to intervention development, which
is an essential step for the development of feasible behaviour change in-
terventions (Kok et al., 2004; Craig et al., 2008).

Although several primary nutrition interventions have attempted to
promote the Mediterranean diet in Western populations (Goulet et al.,
2003; Papadaki and Scott, 2005a; Djuric et al., 2009; Leighton et al.,
2009), no such study has been conducted in England. Thus, to build a
formative research base, according to current frameworks (Kok et al.,
2004; Craig et al., 2008), on which to develop a future web-based,
work-place intervention, this study aimed to assess demographic char-
acteristics, internet usage patterns and adherence to the Mediterranean
diet among healthy male and female adult employees in South West
England. Secondary objectives were to assess potential differences in
these characteristics between genders, as well as differences in adher-
ence to the Mediterranean diet according to demographic characteristics.

Methods

Participants

During autumn 2013, 44 large-scale work-place settings (N200 em-
ployees) in South West England (Bristol, South Gloucestershire and
Wiltshire areas) were identiﬁed and invited by e-mail to participate in
the study. Four work-places (one company engaged in business and
professional services and three local government branches) agreed to
participate. Data were collected via an online questionnaire. A gatekeep-
er at each work-place circulated a web link to the online questionnaire
to their employees via their intranet and/or electronic newsletters. Eli-
gibility criteria were: (a) being currently employed at the work-place,
(b) aged 18–65 years, (c) not suffering from a diet-related disease,
(d) having internet access at work and/or at home and (e) using the in-
ternet at least 2–3 times/month. Participants were entered into a prize
draw to receive one of four £20 gift vouchers per work-place. To provide
recompense for disruption from data collection, each worksite received
a £50 gift voucher. The study was approved by the School for Policy
Studies Research Ethics Committee at the University of Bristol. Partici-
pants provided informed consent after reading participant information
and before completing the survey.

Online survey

An online survey was used to obtain data about demographic and
personal characteristics, internet usage patterns and adherence to the
Mediterranean diet. Participants were asked to report their gender, age,
marital status (‘single’/‘married’/‘cohabiting’/‘separated’/‘divorced’/
‘widowed’) (Grundy and Jamieson, 2002), ethnicity (‘Caucasian’/‘Asian
or Asian British’/‘Chinese’/‘Other Asian background’/‘Black or Black
British’/‘Other Black background’/‘Mixed-White and Black Caribbean’/
‘Mixed-White and Black African’/‘Mixed-White and Asian’/‘Other
mixed background’/‘Other ethnic background’/‘Disclosure of ethnic ori-
gin declined’) (Ofﬁce for National Statistics, 2012), level of education

(‘postgraduate degree’/‘degree or equivalent’/‘higher education below
degree level’/‘A levels’/‘high school’/‘no qualiﬁcations’) (Schneider,
2011), occupation (‘Managerial’/‘Professional’/‘Associate professional/
technical’/‘Administrative/secretarial’/‘Skilled trades’/‘Personal services’/
‘Sales/customer services’/‘Process’/‘Elementary’) (Ofﬁce for National
Statistics, 2014b) and number of children (b18 y) living in their house-
hold (open response). This part also included questions on participants'
working pattern (‘full-/part-time status’), food shopping and food prep-
aration responsibility in their household (‘I am’/‘Family members’/
‘Shared responsibility’/‘Others’) (Papadaki and Scott, 2005a). Partici-
pants were also asked to report the frequency with which they access
the internet at work and at home (‘Several times per day’/‘Once per
day’/‘Several times per week’/‘Once per week’/‘Once per month or less’/
‘No internet access’), the reasons for accessing the internet (choose all
that apply from ‘Sending or receiving email’/‘Work-business-stud-
ies’/‘Chatting-social media’/‘Online shopping’/‘Online gaming’/‘Online
banking’/‘Online education-newspapers’/‘Health-related information’/
‘Entertainment-leisure’/‘Other’) (Ofcom, 2012) and the level of conﬁ-
dence in their ability to use the internet (‘Extremely conﬁdent’/‘Quite
conﬁdent’/‘Neutral’/‘Not very conﬁdent’/‘Not at all conﬁdent’).

For ease of interpretation and analysis, categorical variables were
‘Marital status’ was collapsed into
collapsed where appropriate.
‘Married/cohabiting’, ‘Single’ and ‘Separated/divorced/widowed’. ‘Eth-
nicity’ and ‘Number of children living in household’ were dichotomised
into ‘Caucasian’ and ‘Other ethnicity’ and ‘None’ and ‘≥1’, respectively.

Adherence to the Mediterranean diet

Adherence to the Mediterranean diet was assessed via an 11-item
food frequency questionnaire that requested participants to report the
frequency of consumption of 11 main components of the Mediterranean
diet (Panagiotakos et al., 2006a). A composite Mediterranean diet score
was calculated as follows: for the consumption of components com-
monly consumed in the Mediterranean diet (non-reﬁned cereals, pota-
toes, fruits and fruit juice, vegetables and salad, legumes and ﬁsh), a
score of 0 (lowest adherence) to 5 (highest adherence) was assigned
when a participant reported consumption of 0, 1–4, 5–8, 9–12, 13–18
and N18 servings/month, respectively. For the consumption of compo-
nents which are consumed less frequently in the Mediterranean diet
(red meat and meat products, poultry and whole-fat dairy products), a
score of 0 to 5 was assigned for reported consumption of the above op-
tions, using a reverse scale. A score of 0 to 5 was assigned for using olive
oil (in cooking and meal preparation) ‘never’, ‘rarely’, ‘b1 time/week’,
‘1–3 times/week’, ‘3–5 times/week’ and ‘daily’, respectively. For alcohol
(all alcoholic beverages), a score of 5 was assigned for consumption of
‘b300 ml/day’, a score of 0 for ‘no consumption or consumption of
N700 ml/day’, and scores of 4 to 1 for consumption of ‘300–400 ml’,
‘400–500 ml’,
‘500–600 ml’ and ‘600–700 ml/day’, respectively
(Panagiotakos et al., 2006a). The resulting total score ranged from
0 to 55, with calculated tertiles indicating low (score = 0–20), mod-
erate (score = 21–35) and high (score = 36–55) adherence to the
Mediterranean diet (Panagiotakos et al., 2004, 2006b). The question-
naire has been validated based on the relationship between the cal-
culated total score and individual food component scores and has
been suggested to offer a valid method for assessing Mediterranean
diet adherence and providing dietary modiﬁcation advice for primary
prevention purposes (Panagiotakos et al., 2006a, 2006c), in addition to
having previously been utilised in Mediterranean diet promotion inter-
ventions in non-Mediterranean populations (Sexton et al., 2013).

Statistical analyses

Descriptive statistics (M, SD, N and %) were used to explore demo-
graphic and personal characteristics, internet usage patterns and eating
habits of participants. Independent samples t-tests and Chi-square tests
were used (with a P-value adjusted, as necessary, for multiple-paired

A higher percentage of men accessed the internet from work ‘several
times per day’, compared to women (88.4 vs. 74.1%), and a higher per-
centage of women reported accessing the internet from work ‘once a
day’ (12.8 vs. 4.9%), compared to men (P = 0.004). A higher proportion
of men reported using the internet for general education (68.5 vs.
48.6%) and entertainment (74.1 vs. 58.2%) purposes (P b 0.0001) and
a higher proportion of women reported searching for health-related in-
formation online (49.8 vs. 33.9%, P = 0.001). The vast majority of partic-
ipants (98.8%) reported feeling extremely or quite conﬁdent in using
the internet (Table 2).

The mean Mediterranean diet score for the total study sample was
33.8 (SD 5.4), indicating moderate adherence to the Mediterranean
diet (Table 3). Higher mean scores (indicating closer adherence to the
Mediterranean diet) were reported for alcohol, vegetables, cereals and
fruit, whereas lower mean scores (indicating lower adherence to the
Mediterranean diet) were achieved for dairy products, ﬁsh, legumes,
red meat and poultry. Overall, few participants achieved a high adher-
ence to the Mediterranean diet recommendations for legumes (5.3%),
ﬁsh (3.2%), dairy products (4.8%), red meat (11.9%), poultry (11.1%)
and olive oil (18.2%) (Table 4).

The mean Mediterranean diet score differed according to marital
status. Participants who were married/cohabiting had a slightly higher
score, compared to those who were single (34.2 vs. 32.2, P = 0.003).
Participants with level of education at degree level or higher had a
higher score (34.7 vs. 32.6, P b 0.001) and a higher proportion of them
had high adherence to the Mediterranean diet (44.6 vs. 30.7%, P =
0.001), compared to those with lower educational attainment. There
were no differences in mean Mediterranean diet score or percentage
of participants adhering to the Mediterranean diet according to number
of children living in the household or food shopping responsibility, but

tests), as appropriate, to investigate any differences between males and
females, and to examine Mediterranean diet scores and adherence ac-
cording to marital status, level of education, number of children and
household food shopping and preparation responsibility. All analyses
were performed using Stata version 13 (StataCorp, version 13. College
Station, TX: StataCorp LP, 2013).

Results

The total number of employees across the four participating work-
place settings was 16,214. Five hundred and ninety participants com-
pleted the survey between January and March 2014. The mean age of
participants was 43.8 years (SD 11.1). The majority of participants
were married/cohabiting (75.6%), Caucasian (94.2%) and were educated
to degree level or higher (58.5%). Men were more likely to have higher
educational levels (68.6 vs. 54.7%, P = 0.032), work more hours per
week (37.7 vs. 33.6, P b 0.001) and work on a full-time basis (93.2 vs.
70.0%, P b 0.001), compared to women. Men were also more likely to
work in managerial positions (25.3 vs. 14.7%), whereas a higher propor-
tion of women worked in administrative roles (33.6 vs. 16.0%)
(P b 0.001). A higher percentage of women reported that they were re-
sponsible for food shopping (60.4 vs. 19.2%) and preparation (52.2 vs.
19.8%) in their household (P b 0.001) (Table 1).

Discussion

This study showed that the majority of participating working adults
had moderate adherence to the Mediterranean diet and 39% of partici-
pants had high adherence to the diet. These ﬁndings agree with a previ-
ous Scottish study, where 36% of participants had a high Mediterranean
diet score at baseline (Papadaki and Scott, 2005a). The examination of
individual food components revealed that higher mean scores were
achieved for vegetables, fruit and non-reﬁned cereals. In addition, the
majority of participants achieved high adherence scores for these com-
ponents, which might reﬂect the exposure of UK consumers to national
campaigns and promotion initiatives for higher consumption of these
foods in recent years (Levy, 2013).

Although the results suggest overall moderate compliance with the
Mediterranean diet by the sample population, there were a number of
elements of the diet that had poor compliance. A very low proportion
of participants achieved high adherence scores for legumes, ﬁsh and
dairy products, as well as red meat, poultry and olive oil. There is a
lack of intervention studies promoting the recommended consumption
of these foods in free-living individuals in the UK. Legumes, for example,
are included in the ‘non-dairy sources of protein’ category of the current
UK dietary guidelines, along with meat, ﬁsh and eggs (Harland et al.,
2012). The recommendation to eat some foods from this group on a
daily basis, with no mentioning of the speciﬁc amount of legumes to
be consumed (Public Health England, 2013), might result in increased
intake of meat, as suggested by the current ﬁndings. The reported low
intake of ﬁsh corresponds to the average UK intake (Bates et al.,
2012), whereas the low adherence to the olive oil recommendation
might stem from the limited reference to olive oil consumption in the
UK guidelines (Public Health England, 2013), which is in contrast to
the Mediterranean diet recommendations (Willett, 2006).

Higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet was observed among
higher educated participants, compared to those with lower levels of
education. This is in agreement with earlier literature which has linked
higher levels of education to healthier diets and adherence to dietary
recommendations (Darmon and Drewnowski, 2008). It is noteworthy
that married participants and those who shared food preparation with
family members had higher Mediterranean diet scores, compared to
those who were single or had sole responsibility for food preparation,
respectively, indicating potential family inﬂuences on dietary behav-
iours. Involving the family has been established as a component of effec-
tive work-place interventions (World Health Organisation, 2009), since
potential food-related family interactions could provide support for par-
ticipants while beneﬁting other family members as well (Ebbeling et al.,
2002). This suggests that future work-place interventions should en-
gage participants' families. This could be achieved by developing and
distributing newsletters and involving family members in study-
related work-place events (e.g. cooking demonstrations) (World
Health Organisation, 2009). Such interventions should also explore
and tackle potential barriers faced by single participants or those with
sole responsibility for food preparation, in order to improve their adher-
ence to the Mediterranean diet.

A major strength of this study is that it complies with current frame-
works of behaviour change intervention development by assessing the
evidence base and needs of the target population prior to intervention
design (Kok et al., 2004; National Institute for Health and Clinical
Excellence, 2007; Craig et al., 2008; World Health Organisation, 2009).
A limitation is its cross-sectional design and that the use of a self-
reported food frequency questionnaire to calculate the Mediterranean
diet score might be subject to recall bias. In addition, our sample
consisted of a self-selected group of healthy employees with internet
access. Although this inclusion criterion might exclude employees

with no internet access from participating, we believe that this would
not limit the inclusivity of our study, since all of the participating
work-places used electronic newsletters for information delivery to
their employees, thus indicating wide internet access among all em-
ployees. Although the majority (58%) of participants were highly
educated, our sample covered a relatively wide range of educational
levels and occupations, therefore indicating the range of employees
who might be willing to participate in work-place health promotion
programmes. It was beyond the scope of the current study to assess
physical activity. However, objective measures of physical activity
should be collected in a future work-place nutrition intervention, as
this variable might potentially confound the impact of the intervention.
Although the response rate to the online survey was low (3.6%), we can-
not ensure that all employees in each work-place accessed or read the
study recruitment advertisements, which might have increased partici-
pation rates. Nevertheless, this hinders the ability to generalize our ﬁnd-
ings to the whole target population of adult employees in South West
England.

Results suggest that future interventions promoting the Mediterranean
diet in the UK might be best focussed on the promotion of legumes,
ﬁsh and olive oil, replacing whole-fat dairy products with lower-fat
versions and decreasing intake of red meat and poultry. This may
be best targeted in a step-wise approach to change these compo-
nents, in order to encourage gradual dietary behaviour changes,
which are more likely to lead to long-term maintenance (Fletcher
and Rogers, 1985). In addition, it has been suggested that there is
often a considerable gap between awareness of dietary recommen-
dations and actual behaviour when it comes to meeting these
(Spronk et al., 2014). As this might result from people not being
aware of their unhealthy dietary behaviours (Oenema et al., 2001),
future web-based interventions should provide comprehensive in-
formation on the recommended intakes of the Mediterranean diet
components, as well as the beneﬁts of adhering to those, and incor-
porate dietary assessment tools to monitor achievement of goals to-
wards increasing individual component adherence and adherence to
the Mediterranean diet as a whole. Provision of tailored feedback
following dietary assessment, including a comparison of personal
dietary intake with targets, has been shown to improve awareness
of personal dietary intake, thus facilitating behaviour change
(Oenema et al., 2005). Future web-based interventions should also
supplement tailored feedback with theory-based advice to account

for psychosocial and environmental determinants of dietary behav-
iour, such as addressing barriers and improving self-efﬁcacy to in-
crease Mediterranean diet adherence, which has been suggested to
motivate people to change their eating behaviour (Brug, 1999).

Conclusion

Improvement in the consumption of several components of the
Mediterranean diet is needed to increase adherence to this dietary pat-
tern in this sample of adult employees. Findings from the current forma-
tive research can be used to inform the development of web-based
interventions to promote the Mediterranean diet in work-place settings
in South West England.
