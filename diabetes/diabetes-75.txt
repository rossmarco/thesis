type 2 diabetes1–4

ABSTRACT
Background: Although dietary omega-3 (n23) fatty acids may
confer some cardiovascular beneﬁts, it is unclear whether these
nutrients may also unfavorably affect risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D).
Objective: We evaluated whether dietary omega-3 fatty acids and
ﬁsh consumption were associated with increased risk of T2D.
Design: This was a prospective study of 36,328 women (mean age:
54.6 y) who participated in the Women’s Health Study and who
were followed from 1992 to 2008. Incident T2D was self-reported
and validated primarily through the collection of supplementary
information from participants. Information on omega-3 and ﬁsh
intakes was obtained by using a validated food-frequency question-
naire. We used Cox proportional hazard models to estimate adjusted
relative risks.
Results: During an average follow-up of 12.4 y, 2370 women de-
veloped T2D. Marine but not plant-based omega-3 fatty acids were
positively associated with incident T2D. From the lowest to highest
quintiles of marine omega-3 intake, the multivariable-adjusted haz-
ard ratios (95% CIs) for T2D were 1.0 (referent), 1.17 (1.03, 1.33),
1.20 (1.05, 1.38), 1.46 (1.28, 1.66), and 1.44 (1.25, 1.65), respec-
tively (P for trend , 0.0001). A similar association was observed
with ﬁsh intake, but additional adjustment for docosahexaenoic acid
led to the elimination of the association. The relation between ma-
rine omega-3 fatty acids and T2D was observed in hypertensive and
nonhypertensive subjects and in women who reported infrequent
ﬁsh consumption.
Conclusion: Our data suggest an increased risk of T2D with the in-
take of long-chain omega-3 fatty acids, especially with higher intakes
(0.20 g omega-3/d or 2 servings of ﬁsh/d). The Women’s Health
Am J
Study was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00000479.

INTRODUCTION

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is associated with costly medical com-
plications and a higher risk of death. At birth, the lifetime risk of
T2D ranges from 27% to 53%, depending on one’s ethnicity (1).
Despite advances in medical management of T2D with modern
drugs, T2D remains on the rise and parallels the obesity epidemic.
Therefore, it is critically important to identify relevant risk factors
and protective measures to design effective preventive strategies.
To this end, modiﬁable lifestyle factors, including diet, have been
recognized to play an important role (2–5). Among dietary com-
ponents, omega-3 (n23) fatty acids have also been shown to
confer some cardiac beneﬁts (6–11). However, limited and in-

consistent data have been reported on the effects of omega-3 fatty
acids on glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity.

Observational studies have reported adverse effects of high
amounts of ﬁsh oils on glycemic control in subjects with T2D (12,
13). In a randomized control trial, ﬁsh-oil intervention with
higher amounts of omega-3 (’6 g omega-3/d) was also asso-
ciated with increased blood glucose concentrations and de-
creased insulin sensitivity in T2D patients (14). However,
Woodman et al (15) reported no effect of 4 g puriﬁed eicosa-
pentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)/d on
insulin sensitivity or fasting insulin concentrations in a 6-wk
trial of T2D patients. Given the short durations and higher
amounts of omega-3 used in these trials, it remains unclear
whether EPA and DHA, especially when consumed in small
amounts, have long-term effects on glucose metabolism. It is not
known whether omega-3 fatty acids confer higher risk of T2D in
the general population. Data from the Atherosclerosis Risk in
Communities (ARIC) study (16) showed no association between
marine omega-3 fatty acids and T2D risk, though it is unclear
whether results were similar in men and women. Likewise, data
from the Kouopio Ischemic Heart Disease Risk factor study
reported no association between polyunsaturated fatty acids and
incident diabetes (17); however, the Koupio study was a small
study of men only in whom 34 cases of diabetes occurred after
a short follow-up time (4 y). In contrast, in the Iowa Women’s
Health Study (18), a modest increased risk of T2D was observed

only in the ﬁfth quintile of marine omega-3 fatty acids, which
suggested a threshold effect. Recent data from 3 prospective
cohorts (the Nurses’ Health Study I and II and the Health Pro-
fessionals Follow-Up Study) were suggestive of a modest in-
creased risk of T2D with consumption of higher amounts of
long-chain omega-3 and ﬁsh in women but not in men (19).
However, it is unclear whether the ﬁsh-diabetes relation is me-
diated by long-chain omega-3. It remains important to determine
whether consumption of small to moderate amounts of total and
individual omega-3 adversely affects risk of T2D. Thus, we
sought to prospectively examine the association between dietary
omega-3 fatty acids [including a-linolenic acid (ALA)] and ﬁsh
consumption and incident diabetes in the Women’s Health
Study.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS

Study participants

Subjects were participants in the Women’s Health Study,
a completed randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial
designed to study the effects of low-dose aspirin and vitamin E on
the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease and cancer in
1992–2004. At the completion of the trial, participants have been
prospectively followed up. Detailed descriptions of the Women’s
Health Study have been published (20–22). Of the 39,876 female
subjects aged 45 y at entry (1992–1995), we excluded women
with self-reported diabetes at baseline (n = 1148), missing data
on omega-3 fatty acids (as a consequence of missing items on
a food-frequency questionnaire to allow nutrient computation)
or ﬁsh consumption (n = 1339), and missing data on key co-
variates,
including exercise, smoking, alcohol consumption,
hypertension, menopausal status, and body mass index (BMI;
n = 1061). Thus, a total sample of 36,328 women from the
parent study was analyzed for the current project. Each woman
signed an informed consent form, and the Institutional Review
Board at Brigham and Women’s Hospital approved the study
protocol.

Ascertainment of T2D

The ascertainment of T2D and other endpoints was achieved
by asking women to report these items on annual follow-up
questionnaires. All cases of self-reports of T2D were validated by
using the American Diabetes Association criteria by primarily
obtaining additional information with a telephone interview and
supplemental questionnaire (23, 24). The positive predictive
value for self-reported T2D in this cohort by using these vali-
dation procedures was 91% (23).

Exposure assessment

Dietary omega-3 fatty acids were derived from a single,
baseline 128-food-frequency questionnaire, which was pre-
viously validated (25, 26). ALA, EPA, and DHA were in-
dividually adjusted for energy intake by using the residual
method (27). For total marine omega-3 fatty acids, we used the
sum of energy-adjusted EPA, DHA, and docosapentaenoic acid.
For each fatty acid, we created quintiles and 4 indicator variables
for analyses. Fish consumption was obtained through 4 items on
the food-frequency questionnaire. Participants were asked to

report their average consumption of canned tuna (3–4 oz), dark-
meat ﬁsh (3–5 oz), other ﬁsh (3–5 oz), and shrimp, lobster, and
scallops as a main dish over the past year. Possible responses
included never or ,1 time/mo, 1–3 times/mo, 1 time/wk, 2–4
times/wk, 5–6 times/wk, 1 time/d; 2–3 times/d, 4–5 times/d, and
6 times/d. We converted individual responses into servings per
day by using the midpoint for each response category. We
summed the frequency of consumption of canned tuna, dark ﬁsh,
other ﬁsh, and shrimp, lobster, and scallops as a main dish to
obtain a ﬁsh variable and created quintiles of ﬁsh consumption.

Ascertainment of other covariates

Demographic data were collected at baseline. Self-reported
baseline weight and height were used to compute BMI (weight in
kilograms divided by height in meters squared). Self-reported
walking, stair climbing, and participation in 8 groups of recre-
ational activities were obtained to estimate the energy expended
on physical activity (28, 29). In addition, information on the
prevalence of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, parental his-
tory of diabetes, menopausal status, hormone therapy, smoking,
and alcohol consumption was obtained at baseline.

Statistical analyses

We calculated person-time of follow-up from baseline until the
ﬁrst occurrence of 1) T2D, 2) death, or 3) censoring date, which
was the date of receipt of the last follow-up questionnaire for the
current study. We used Cox proportional hazard models to
compute multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios with correspond-
ing 95% CIs by using subjects in the lowest quintile of omega-3
fatty acid or ﬁsh consumption as the reference group. A parsi-
monious model adjusted for age, BMI, parental history of di-
abetes, smoking (never, former, and current smoker), exercise
(quintiles of metabolic equivalent task hours per week), alcohol
intake (4 categories), and menopausal status (pre- or post-
menopausal or uncertain). A ﬁnal multivariable model also
controlled for red-meat intake and quintiles of energy intake,
linoleic acid, ALA, dietary magnesium, trans and saturated fats,
cereal ﬁber, and glycemic index (quintiles for all of these vari-
ables). To examine whether the relation between ﬁsh con-
sumption and diabetes was mediated by EPA or DHA, we
evaluated the risk of diabetes associated with reported ﬁsh intake
while adjusting for EPA or DHA in the multivariable model. The
P value for the linear trend was obtained by ﬁtting a continuous
variable that assigned the median value for each exposure cat-
egory in a Cox regression model.

In secondary analyses, we examined possible effect modiﬁ-
cation by prevalent hypertension (yes or no) and infrequent
compared with regular ﬁsh consumption. We also conducted
sensitivity analyses by excluding subjects with ,2 y of follow-up
or by restricting follow-up to the ﬁrst 5 y. Last, we analyzed
omega-3 as a continuous variable. All analyses were completed
with SAS, version 9.1 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). The signiﬁ-
cance level was set at 0.05.

RESULTS

The mean age of women at baseline was 54.6 6 7.0 y. The
median intake (interquartile range) of ALA, EPA, DHA, and
total marine omega-3 fatty acids in this population was 1.11 g

ALA/d (0.92–1.34 ALA/d), 0.04 g EPA/d (0.02–0.08 g EPA/d),
0.12 g DHA/d (0.08–0.19 g DHA/d), and 0.18 g total marine
omega-3 fatty acids/d (0.11–0.30 g total marine omega-3 fatty
acids/d). The baseline characteristics of the study participants
according to dietary omega-3 fatty acids are presented in Tables
1 and 2. A higher intake of omega-3 was associated with more
physical activity and a higher intake of cereal ﬁber, fruit and
vegetables, magnesium, and cholesterol. In contrast, omega-3
intake was inversely associated with the consumption of red
meat, nuts, and trans and saturated fats.

Dietary omega-3 and risk of T2D

During a mean follow-up of 12.4 y, 2370 (6.5%) new cases of
T2D occurred in this population. Dietary intake of ALA was not
associated with incident diabetes (Table 3). In contrast, a higher
intake of marine omega-3 fatty acids was associated with in-
cident T2D. Compared with the lowest quintile of EPA, the risk
of T2D was 8% (26% to 24%), 25% (11–42%), 30% (13–49%),
and 38% (21–59%) higher in the second, third, fourth, and ﬁfth
quintiles of EPA, respectively, in a model that was controlled for
age, BMI, parental history of diabetes, smoking, exercise, al-
cohol intake, menopausal status, red-meat intake, and quintiles
of energy intake, linoleic acid, ALA, dietary magnesium, trans
fat, saturated fat, cereal ﬁber, and glycemic index (P for linear
trend , 0.0001; Table 3). Corresponding values for DHA were
21% (6–38%), 21% (6–39%), 46% (28–68%), and 52% (33–
75%) higher, respectively (P for linear trend , 0.0001; Table 3).
For total long-chain omega-3 fatty acids (EPA, docosapentae-
noic acid, and DHA), corresponding increased risk of T2D was

17% (3–33%), 20% (5–38%), 46% (28–66%), and 44% (25–
65%) higher, respectively (P for trend , 0.0001; Table 3). These
ﬁndings persisted after stratiﬁcation by ﬁsh intake. For example,
in women who reported infrequent ﬁsh consumption (,1/wk),
multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (95% CIs) for T2D were
1.0, 1.21 (1.03, 1.42), 1.27 (1.01, 1.60), 1.11 (0.79, 1.57), and
1.76 (1.02, 3.04) from the lowest to the highest quintiles of total
long-chain omega-3 fatty acids, respectively (P for trend =
0.015). In women who reported ﬁsh consumption of .1/wk,
corresponding hazard ratios (95% CIs) were 1.0, 0.99 (0.74,
1.33), 1.03 (0.78, 1.38), 1.31 (0.99, 1.74), and 1.28 (0.96, 1.70),
respectively (P for trend = 0.0002). Likewise, a similar associ-
ation was observed when the relation between ﬁsh intake and
T2D was stratiﬁed by prevalent hypertension at baseline, and no
signiﬁcant interaction was shown between ﬁsh intake and hy-
pertension (P = 0.74; Figure 1).

Fish consumption and risk of T2D

A higher consumption of ﬁsh was associated with a higher risk of
incident T2D, especially in the fourth and ﬁfth quintiles of ﬁsh
intake (P for trend , 0.0001; Table 4). In the comparison of
a median ﬁsh intake of 3.93 servings of ﬁsh/wk (highest quintile)
with the lowest category of ﬁsh consumption (median: 0.47 serv-
ing of ﬁsh/wk), there was a 49% (30–70%) increased risk of T2D in
a multivariable-adjusted model (Table 4). This positive association
between ﬁsh consumption and T2D risk was almost eliminated on
additional adjustment of DHA (which contributed .50% of total
marine omega-3 FA in this population) and was minimally inﬂu-
enced after additional adjustment for EPA (Table 5).

Sensitivity analyses

When we restricted analyses to the ﬁrst 5 y of follow-up, we
observed similar ﬁndings. For example, from the lowest to the
highest quintiles of ﬁsh intake, multivariable-adjusted hazard
ratios (95% CIs) were 1.0, 1.07 (0.84, 1.37), 1.21 (0.94, 1.55),
1.31 (1.03, 1.68), and 1.42 (1.11, 1.82), respectively (P for trend =
0.004). Similar results were seen for marine omega-3 (P for trend
= 0.009). The exclusion of women with ,2 y of follow-up and
stratiﬁcation by BMI did not alter these results (data not shown).
When analyzed as continuous variables, the b coefﬁcient (SE) and
P value from the multivariable models were 0.98121 (0.27659)
and 0.0004 for EPA, 0.78496 (0.16163) and ,0.0001 for DHA,
and 0.43879 (0.09749) and ,0.0001 for total marine omega-3
fatty acids. Restriction to white women (95% of the sample) did
not alter the ﬁndings.

DISCUSSION

In this prospective study, we showed that dietary marine
omega-3 fatty acids (EPA and DHA) were individually associated
with an increased risk of incident diabetes, especially with
omega-3 intake 0.20 g omega-3/d or 2 servings of ﬁsh/d
(which suggested a threshold effect). Furthermore, ﬁsh con-
sumption was positively related to incident diabetes, and this
association was attenuated after further adjustment for DHA. In
contrast, the plant-based omega-3 fatty acid (ALA) was not
associated with incident diabetes in this cohort.

Although omega-3 fatty acids have been shown to lower risk
of coronary heart disease and cardiac deaths, limited and in-

consistent data are available on the relation between omega-3
fatty acids and measures of glucose metabolism. In a cross-
sectional study, a positive relation was observed between dietary
ALA and fasting insulin but not fasting glucose concentrations
(4), but Woodman et al (15) reported no effect of high amounts of
puriﬁed EPA or DHA (4 g EPA or DHA/d) on insulin sensitivity
or fasting insulin concentrations in a 6-wk trial of T2D patients.
In a case-cohort study (30), neither phospholipids nor dietary
omega-3 fatty acids were associated with incident diabetes. These
results were similar to those from the ARIC study (16) and the
Kouopio study (17) that also showed no association between
marine omega-3 fatty acids or polyunsaturated fatty acids and
T2D risk, respectively. In contrast, higher but not lower amounts
of long-chain omega-3 fatty acids were associated with a modest
increase in incident diabetes in participants of the Nurses’ Health
Study I and II with a signiﬁcant 25% increased risk of diabetes
when the highest to the lowest quintiles of long-chain omega-3
fatty acids were compared (19). A suggestive, although not
signiﬁcant, increased risk of T2D with higher intakes of long-
chain omega-3 fatty acids was reported in 51,529 participants of
the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study (19). Our data showed
increased risk of T2D with higher intakes of long-chain omega-3
fatty acids and are consistent with a threshold effect as suggested
by reports from the Nurses’ Health studies (19) and the Iowa
Women’s Health Study (18). Speciﬁcally, relative risks were
close to unity except for the ﬁfth quintile (0.39 g omega-3/d),
which showed increased risk of diabetes in the Iowa Women’s
Health Study (18) [adjusted hazard ratio (95% CI) of 1.20 (1.03,
1.39) compared to the lowest quintile of long-chain omega-3 fatty

Long-chain omega-3 fatty acids are predominantly found in
fatty ﬁsh. Hence, if the association between EPA and DHA and

with frequent intakes of ﬁsh. Data from the Nurses’ Health
studies (19) reported an increased risk of T2D with ﬁsh con-
sumption of 2 servings of ﬁsh/wk but not a meaningful in-
crease below that
the multivariable-adjusted
hazard ratios (95% CIs) were 1.0, 1.02 (0.87, 1.21), 1.12 (0.97,
1.29), 1.22 (1.04, 1.43), and 1.29 (1.05, 1.57) for ﬁsh intake of
,1 time/mo, 1–3 times/mo, 1 time/wk, 2–4 times/wk, and 5
times/wk, respectively. These results were consistent with our
ﬁndings of which higher (’2 or more servings of ﬁsh/d) but not
lower amounts of ﬁsh consumption were associated with an
increased risk of diabetes. The magnitude of effect was larger in
our cohort, with a 49% increased risk of T2D in the highest
quintile of ﬁsh intake (median: 3.93 servings of ﬁsh/wk) than in
the lowest quintile of ﬁsh intake (median: 0.46 servings of ﬁsh/
wk). Because other nutrients in ﬁsh (other than EPA and DHA)
could partially explain the positive association between ﬁsh
consumption and T2D, we examined the possible mediation by
EPA and DHA. The ﬁsh-diabetes relation was minimally at-
tenuated after adjustment for EPA and was eliminated after
adjustment for DHA. Such attenuation was consistent with
a potential causal effect of DHA shown in ﬁsh. Furthermore, the
fact that we observed a similar positive relation between dietary
long-chain omega-3 and T2D risk in women who reported in-
frequent ﬁsh consumption further strengthened the hypothesis

that DHA but no other nutrients in ﬁsh or contaminants in ﬁsh
may be responsible for the observed ﬁndings. In our sample,
23% of long-chain omega-3 consumed was EPA whereas 77%
was DHA, on average. This unbalanced distribution of EPA and
DHA might provide an alternative explanation of why we ob-
served only a minimal attenuation of the ﬁsh-diabetes associa-
tion after adjustment for EPA.

We did not observe an association between plant-based ALA
and incident diabetes. This result was consistent with the ﬁndings
of the Nurses’ Health Study and Health Professionals Follow-Up
Study, which also did not show a relation between ALA and
incident diabetes (19). Likewise, the ARIC study (16) did not ﬁnd
a difference in plasma ALA concentrations between diabetes
cases and noncases. It is possible that health beneﬁts of ALA may
differ from those of long-chain omega-3 fatty acids.

What biological mechanisms, if any, may support a causal
relation between long-chain omega-3 fatty acids and incident
diabetes? Compared with olive oil intake in patients with T2D,
a 6-wk intervention with 4 g EPA or DHA led to a 1.40-mmol/L
(P = 0.002) and 0.98-mmol/L (P = 0.002) increase in fasting
glucose concentrations, respectively (15); In contrast, neither
EPA nor DHA had any effect on fasting insulin concentrations,
insulin sensitivity, or C-peptide or glycated hemoglobin (Hb
A1c) concentrations (15). In a meta-analysis of 26 trials, ﬁsh-oil

intake, compared with placebo intake, was associated with el-
evated fasting glucose concentrations; each increase of a gram
of EPA per day led to a 0.38% (95% CI: 0.00%, 0.76%) increase
in Hb A1c concentrations and the corresponding increase in Hb
A1c concentrations with DHA was 0.6% (95% CI: 0.06, 1.15%)
(31). In particular, every gram of DHA per day was associated
with an increase in fasting glucose concentrations of 0.74 mmol/L
(95% CI: 0.16, 1.32 mmol/L) (31). However, another meta-
analysis of 18 trials did not ﬁnd a signiﬁcant effect of ﬁsh oil on
fasting glucose or Hb A1c concentrations (32). In a 6-wk in-
tervention trial in 59 overweight individuals, an intake of 4 g
EPA/d was associated with a slight increase in fasting glucose
concentrations (P = 0.062), whereas DHA intake had no effect
on fasting glucose concentrations; in addition, EPA and DHA
intakes were associated with an 18% (P = 0.035) and 27% (P =
0.001) increase in fasting insulin concentrations compared with
those associated with a placebo intake (33). In another ran-
domized trial, ﬁsh-oil (containing 1.8 g EDA/d and 3 g DHA/d)
intervention was associated with increased fasting glucose
concentrations and decreased insulin sensitivity in T2D subjects
after 9 wk of intervention (14). In contrast, other randomized
trials showed no effects of EPA and DHA on insulin sensitivity
(34, 35). Although inconsistent across studies, there are possible
biologic mechanisms to support a causal relation between higher
intakes of long-chain omega-3 fatty acids and incident diabetes.
Our study has some limitations. First, we had only one dietary
assessment for our analyses. Thus, we were unable to account for
possible changes over time in omega-3 fatty acid intake in our
cohort. However, similar relations were seen when analyses were
restricted to the ﬁrst 5 y of follow-up (the period within which
dietary habits were less likely to change much), which suggested
that our ﬁndings were unlikely to be explained by a possible bias
introduced by a change in dietary habits over time. Second,
subjects at risk of cardiovascular disease who may also be at
increased risk of T2D may have been advised to consume
more ﬁsh by their primary care physician. Such a scenario would
have led to a bias of a positive association. The fact that we saw
similar results in women who reported infrequent ﬁsh con-
sumption, and individuals with prevalent coronary disease at
baseline were excluded, minimizes the possibility of confounding
by indication in our data. Third, we could not exclude exposure
misclassiﬁcation because of the self-reported nature of diet.
However, because the collection of dietary information preceded
the occurrence of diabetes, such misclassiﬁcation was likely to be
nondifferential and bias the observed results toward the null.
Fourth, we could not exclude residual or unmeasured con-
founding because of observational nature of our study. We also
lacked detailed data on ﬁsh-oil supplements. Fifth, we did not
have data on fasting insulin and glucose concentrations to explore
possible biological pathways by which dietary omega-3 may
inﬂuence risk of diabetes. Given the high correlation between
EPA and DHA (Pearson’s r = 0.91) in our data, collinearity
prevented us from completely examining the independent effects
of EPA or DHA on diabetes (while adjusting for the other type
of omega-3). Sixth, we did not have data on fasting glucose or
hemoglobin A1c concentrations on all participants to fully ex-
amine relations between dietary omega-3 and those biomarkers.
Lastly, participants were mostly white, female, health care pro-
fessionals (95%), which thereby limited the generalizability of
our ﬁndings. Although we showed a positive association between

higher amounts of omega-3 and T2D in white women, we did
not have adequate sample size to explore such a relation in other
ethnic groups.
Nevertheless, the large sample size, the lengthy (10 y)
follow-up and nearly complete ascertainment of vital status in
this cohort, the robustness of our results in sensitivity analyses,
the standardized method of collection of data on various po-
tential confounders, and the large number of incident-diabetes
cases were major strengths of this study.

If conﬁrmed in other populations, these ﬁndings can inform
future recommendations on dietary approaches to prevent T2D.
In consideration of the potential cardiovascular beneﬁts of omega-
3, future studies are warranted to determine a threshold below
which cardiac beneﬁts are preserved and risk of T2D remains
neutral. Because of the lack of an association with ALA, plant-
based omega-3 might appear attractive for people at increased risk
of T2D (including individuals with a positive parental history of
diabetes or with genetic polymorphism associated with an in-
creased risk of diabetes).

In conclusion, our data are consistent with a modest and
threshold relation between EPA and DHA intakes and incident
T2D, whereas ALA intake does not appear to be associated with
an increase risk. Because the observed risk of T2D was mostly
seen with higher intakes of omega-3 or ﬁsh (’2 servings
omega-3 or ﬁsh/d), our data do not support the prohibition of
long-chain omega-3 fatty acids when consumed in moderation.
Additional studies that conﬁrm these ﬁndings and that focus on
biological mechanisms in nondiabetic individuals and possible
differential effects of EPA compared with DHA on glucose
metabolism and insulin sensitivity are warranted.
