ABSTRACT
Background: Sugar-sweetened beverages are risk factors for type 2
diabetes; however, the role of artiﬁcially sweetened beverages is
unclear.
Objective: The objective was to examine the associations of sugar-
and artiﬁcially sweetened beverages with incident type 2 diabetes.
Design: An analysis of healthy men (n = 40,389) from the Health
Professionals Follow-Up Study, a prospective cohort study, was per-
formed. Cumulatively averaged intakes of sugar-sweetened (sodas,
fruit punches, lemonades, fruit drinks) and artiﬁcially sweetened (diet
sodas, diet drinks) beverages from food-frequency questionnaires
were tested for associations with type 2 diabetes by using Cox
regression.
Results: There were 2680 cases over 20 y of follow-up. After age
adjustment, the hazard ratio (HR) for the comparison of the top with
the bottom quartile of sugar-sweetened beverage intake was 1.25
(95% CI: 1.11, 1.39; P for trend , 0.01). After adjustment for
confounders, including multivitamins, family history, high triglycer-
ides at baseline, high blood pressure, diuretics, pre-enrollment
weight change, dieting, total energy, and body mass index, the
HR was 1.24 (95% CI: 1.09, 1.40; P for trend , 0.01). Intake of
artiﬁcially sweetened beverages was signiﬁcantly associated with
type 2 diabetes in the age-adjusted analysis (HR: 1.91; 95% CI:
1.72, 2.11; P for trend , 0.01) but not in the multivariate-adjusted
analysis (HR: 1.09; 95% CI: 0.98, 1.21; P for trend = 0.13). The
replacement of one serving of sugar-sweetened beverage with 1 cup
(’237 mL) of coffee was associated with a risk reduction of 17%.
Conclusion: Sugar-sweetened beverage consumption is associated
with a signiﬁcantly elevated risk of type 2 diabetes, whereas the
association between artiﬁcially sweetened beverages and type 2
diabetes was largely explained by health status, pre-enrollment

INTRODUCTION

Consumption of

(eg,

sugar-sweetened beverages

sodas,
sweetened fruit drinks) in the United States rose 135% between
1977 and 2001, and in 2004 soda represented 7% of per-capita
energy intake (1, 2). In parallel with these changes, the prevalence
of obesity and type 2 diabetes in the United States has risen
dramatically (3). In prospective cohort studies, sugar-sweetened
beverages are major risk factors for weight gain and type 2 di-
abetes (4, 5).

Taxing of sugar-sweetened beverages has been proposed to
encourage the consumption of other potentially healthier bev-

erages, such as water, low-fat milk, 100% fruit juice, coffee, and
tea (6). It is unclear whether artiﬁcially sweetened beverages
should be recommended because they have been shown to be
associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes and car-
diometabolic dysfunction in some studies (7–9).

The purposes of this study were to examine the associations of
sugar and artiﬁcially sweetened beverages with type 2 diabetes in
a well-characterized cohort of men and to determine what other
beverages should be considered as alternatives.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS

Subjects

In 1986, 51,529 men aged 40–75 y were recruited to form the
Health Professionals Follow-Up Study (HPFS). As part of the
study, questionnaires were mailed every other year to participants
to assess health status and lifestyle factors (94% response rate).
The HPFS was approved by the Harvard Institutional Review
Board (Dietary Etiologies of Heart Disease and Cancer Protocol
no. 10446). The procedures followed were in accordance with the
ethical standards of Harvard University and with the Helsinki
Declaration of 1975, as revised in 1983.

Assessment of beverage intake

Intake of sugar-sweetened and artiﬁcially sweetened beverages
was assessed by using a 131-item semiquantitative food-frequency
questionnaire (FFQ) that was sent to participants every 4 y.
Participants were asked to report their usual intake (never to
6 times/d) of a standard portion of foods and beverages (one

standard glass, can, or bottle). Nutrient and energy intakes were
calculated by multiplying intakes by nutrient and energy con-
tents and summing across all
items. Total sugar-sweetened
beverages were deﬁned as caffeinated colas, caffeine-free colas,
other carbonated sugar-sweetened beverages, and noncarbonated
sugar-sweetened beverages (fruit punches, lemonades, or other
fruit drinks). Artiﬁcially sweetened beverages were deﬁned
as caffeinated, caffeine-free, and noncarbonated low-calorie
beverages.

The FFQ was validated against two 7-d diet records admin-
istered 6 mo apart in a validation study (n = 127) (10). Correlations
between these measures after correction for within-person var-
iation were 0.84 for colas, 0.74 for low-calorie colas, and 0.55
for other carbonated sugar-sweetened beverages (10) For non-
carbonated sugar-sweetened beverages (fruit punches, lemon-
ades, and fruit drinks), the correlation was 0.40, which was not
corrected for within-person variation because of the high ratio
of within- to between-person variance (7.26) (10). Correlations
were 0.53 for water, 0.88 for low-fat milk, 0.75–0.89 for fruit
juices, 0.93 for coffee, and 0.77 for tea (10).

Ascertainment of endpoints

To verify self-reported diagnoses of type 2 diabetes, a sup-
plementary questionnaire was mailed to the participants (11).
Cases before 1998 were deﬁned by using National Diabetes
Data Group criteria, and American Diabetes Association criteria
were used for those after 1998. Participants with type 1 diabetes
were excluded. In a validation study, 97% of type 2 diabetes
cases were conﬁrmed by medical record review (11).

Statistical analysis

Participants with type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease (heart
attack, stroke, angina, or coronary artery bypass graft), cancer
(except nonmelanoma skin cancer) or an implausible energy
intake (,800 or .4200 kcal/d) at baseline were excluded, which
left 40,389 participants.

Person-time was calculated from the return of the baseline
questionnaire until 31 January 2006, death, loss to follow-up,
development of type 2 diabetes, or whichever occurred ﬁrst.
Hazard ratios (HRs) for type 2 diabetes were modeled by using
age-stratiﬁed Cox proportional hazard models with time-varying
covariates. Beverage intake was grouped into quartiles, and linear
trends were evaluated by using the Wald test (1 df) on a term
representing the median intake in each quartile.

Cumulative averages of dietary variables were calculated at
each time point to account for previous dietary information and to
reﬂect long-term patterns of intake. To control for recall bias,
averages were not updated after the diagnosis of cancer or
cardiovascular disease. Other covariates were updated at each
time point. Analyses were repeated by using baseline dietary data
to assess the association between a single measure of beverage
intake and type 2 diabetes.

We adjusted for smoking (never; past; current, 1–15 cigarettes/d;
current, .15 cigarettes/d; or missing), physical activity (quin-
tiles of metabolic equivalents/wk, or missing), and alcohol in-
take (abstainers, 0–9.9 g/d, 10–20 g/d, .20 g/d, or missing). We
also adjusted for family history of type 2 diabetes, high trigly-
cerides in 1986, and high blood pressure to control for known

diabetes and cardiovascular disease risk, which might motivate
participants to change their beverage consumption. We did not
adjust for high triglycerides during the follow-up because it
could be an early marker for type 2 diabetes. Diuretic use was
adjusted for as a marker of overall health and because diuretics
affect thirst. Multivitamin intake from 1988 onward was ad-
justed to control for self-interest in maintaining good health,
which could be a marker of diabetes risk as well as beverage
intake. Diet quality was controlled for by using the alterna-
tive Healthy Eating Index (aHEI; in quintiles) (12). Recalled
weight change between 1981 and 1986 (weight gain: 0, 0.9–1.8,
2.3–4.1, 4.5–6.4, 6.8–8.6, 9.1–13.2, or 13.6 kg; weight loss:
0, 0.9–1.8, 2.3–4.1, 4.5–6.4, or 6.8 kg) and adherence to a low-
calorie diet in 1994 were adjusted to control for changes in
overall health and diabetes risk associated with dieting and also
possible changes in beverage intake. Finally, total energy intake
(quintiles) and body mass index [BMI (in kg/m2) ,23, 23–23.9,
24–24.9, 25–26.9, 27–28.9, 29–30.9, 31–32.9, 33–34.9, 35, or
missing] were adjusted to study potential mediators of the re-
lation between beverage intake and type 2 diabetes. If BMI,
smoking, or physical activity was missing during the follow-up,
the last value was carried forward. Cubic splines with 3, 4, and
5 knots were used to test for nonlinear associations.

In a sensitivity analysis, cases of type 2 diabetes occurring
during the ﬁrst 2 y of follow-up were excluded to assess the extent
that pre-existing insulin resistance may bias associations. Also, to
explore the role of elapsed time between the assessment of
beverage intake and a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes, 4- and 8-y
lagged analyses were performed. For these analyses, beverage
intake was used to predict disease occurring 4 or 8 y later.

Analyses were repeated after stratiﬁcation by age (. compared
with ,65 y), alcohol consumption (drinker compared with ab-
stainer), family history of type 2 diabetes (yes or no), physical
activity [low (quintile 1 and quintile 2), medium (quintile 3 and
quintile 4), or high (quintile 5)], and BMI (,25, 25–29.9, or
30). The Wald test (1 df) was used for interaction testing of
cross-product terms (eg, median beverage intake · median BMI).
Risk of type 2 diabetes was also determined according to the
per-serving (continuous) intake of sugar-sweetened (total, colas,
carbonated noncolas, fruit punches, and lemonades) and artiﬁcially
sweetened beverages after adjustment for continuous covariates. A
similar analysis was performed for water, low-fat milk (skim, 1%
fat, and 2% fat), fruit juice (orange, apple, grapefruit, and other
fruit juice), coffee (caffeinated and decaffeinated), and tea (caf-
feinated) as a comparison. Beverages with signiﬁcant associations
with type 2 diabetes were included in a mutually adjusted model to
assess the effect of substituting one beverage for another. Cross-
product terms were included in the regression models to test for
synergistic effects. Because the aHEI includes a measure of low-fat
milk and fruit juice, red and processed meat and cereal ﬁber were
adjusted for in these analyses. SAS version 9.1 (SAS, Cary, NC)
was used for all analyses, and a P value 0.05 was considered
statistically signiﬁcant.

(mean 6 SD: 0.21 6 0.46/d). The mean consumption of artiﬁ-
cially sweetened beverages was 3.4 servings/wk (mean 6 SD:
0.49 6 0.94/d). The intakes of sugar and artiﬁcially sweetened
beverages were weakly but inversely correlated (Pearson’s R =
20.10, P , 0.01)

Consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages was signiﬁcantly
associated with lower overall diet quality as measured by the
aHEI (Table 1). Sugar-sweetened beverages were also associ-
ated with higher intakes of red and processed meat, carbohy-
drate, total fat, glycemic load, and energy, but with lower intakes
of protein, vegetable fat, cereal ﬁber, and alcohol. Compared
with nonconsumers, high consumers of sugar-sweetened bev-
erages either lost less weight or gained more weight between
1981 and 1986 and were less likely to have followed a low-
calorie diet in 1994. They were also more likely to be current
smokers and were less likely to be physically active, to have
a family history of type 2 diabetes, or take multivitamins.

Consumption of artiﬁcially sweetened beverages was sig-
niﬁcantly associated with higher overall diet quality. This

corresponded to a lower intake of red and processed meat, car-
bohydrate, glycemic load, and energy but with a higher intake of
protein, total fat, animal fat, vegetable fat, and cereal ﬁber.
Compared with nonconsumers, high consumers either lost more
weight or gained more weight between 1981 and 1986 and were
more likely to have followed a low-calorie diet in 1994. They also
had a higher BMI, were less likely to be current smokers, and
were more likely to be physically active, to have a family history
of type 2 diabetes, to take multivitamins, to have high trigly-
cerides, to have high blood pressure, or to use diuretics.

Regression analysis

There were 2680 incident cases of type 2 diabetes over 20 y of
follow-up (370,331 observations, 710,537 person-years). After
adjustment for age, both beverage types were signiﬁcantly as-
sociated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes: top compared
with bottom quartile of sugar-sweetened beverages (HR: 1.25;
95% CI: 1.11, 1.39; P for trend , 0.01) and top compared with

bottom quartile of artiﬁcially sweetened beverages (HR: 1.91;
95% CI: 1.72, 2.11; P for trend , 0.01) (Table 2).

After adjustment for smoking, physical activity, alcohol in-
take, and multivitamin use, associations were partly attenuated
for sugar-sweetened beverages but with ,1% for artiﬁcially
sweetened beverages. Progressive adjustment for family history,
high triglycerides, high blood pressure, diuretic use, previous
weight change, and a low-calorie diet strengthened the associ-
ation for sugar-sweetened beverages but weakened the associa-
tion for artiﬁcially sweetened beverages. Further adjustment for
the aHEI and total energy weakened the association for sugar-
sweetened beverages but strengthened the association for arti-
ﬁcially sweetened beverages. Adjustment for BMI strengthened
the association for sugar-sweetened beverages, but attenuated
the association for artiﬁcially sweetened beverages. In the fully
adjusted models, intake of sugar-sweetened beverages was sig-
niﬁcantly associated with the risk of type 2 diabetes (HR: 1.24;
95% CI: 1.09, 1.40; P for trend , 0.01); however, intake of

artiﬁcially sweetened beverages was not (HR: 1.09; 95% CI:
0.98, 1.21; P for trend = 0.13). Associations were tested for
nonlinearity, but no signiﬁcant evidence of nonlinearity was
found (P for curvature .0.13). Use of baseline beverage intake
yielded similar results for sugar-sweetened beverages (HR: 1.19;
95% CI: 1.07, 1.33; P for trend , 0.01) and artiﬁcially sweet-
ened beverages (HR: 1.08; 95% CI: 0.98, 1.19; P for trend =
0.12), as did the exclusion of the ﬁrst 2 y of type 2 diabetes cases
or performing lagged analyses (data not shown). No signiﬁcant
interactions were observed between beverage intake and age,
alcohol, physical activity, or family history (data not shown).

The use of continuous variables and covariates did not change
the results (Table 3). One serving of sugar-sweetened beverages
per day was signiﬁcantly associated with a 16% increased risk of
type 2 diabetes (HR: 1.16; 95% CI: 1.08, 1.25; P , 0.01), which
was primarily due to colas and carbonated noncolas. Fruit
punches, lemonades, and other fruit drinks were not signiﬁcantly
associated with type 2 diabetes. However the intake was low, the

1 Models were multivariate adjusted as in Table 2 by using continuous covariates (except for smoking and alcohol). In
this analysis, red and processed meat and cereal ﬁber (both continuous variables) replace the alternative Healthy Eating
Index. For sugar-sweetened and artiﬁcially sweetened beverages, one serving is equivalent to a standard glass, can, or
bottle. For other beverages, one serving is equivalent to 1 cup (’237 mL). Low-fat milk includes skim, 1% fat, and 2% fat
milk. Coffee includes both caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee. Tea includes only caffeinated tea. Fruit juice includes
apple, orange, grapefruit, and other fruit juices. Because of missing data, there were 368,293 observations and 2670 events
in this analysis.

CIs included those for colas, and there was a great deal of
within-person variation in intake.

Low-fat milk, tea, and fruit juice were not signiﬁcantly as-
sociated with type 2 diabetes, but water was associated with a 3%
greater risk of type 2 diabetes per serving per day (HR: 1.03; 95%
CI: 1.01, 1.06; P = 0.01; Table 3). One serving of coffee per day
was signiﬁcantly associated with a 6% lower risk of type 2 di-
abetes (HR: 0.94; 95% CI: 0.91, 0.96; P , 0.01). In a mutually
adjusted model, nearly 3.5 cups (’830 mL) coffee were re-
quired to negate the risk associated with 1 serving of sugar-
sweetened beverages, and replacement of one sugar-sweetened
beverage with 1 cup coffee was associated with a risk reduction
of 17%. The risk of type 2 diabetes according to the intake of
coffee and sugar-sweetened beverages is shown in Table 4. No
signiﬁcant interaction was observed between coffee and sugar-
sweetened beverages. (P = 0.72).

DISCUSSION

In the current study, we showed that consumption of sugar-
sweetened beverages was associated with an increased risk of
type 2 diabetes in a large cohort of men. Artiﬁcially sweetened
beverages were not associated with type 2 diabetes after mul-
tivariate adjustment, whereas coffee was inversely associated
with type 2 diabetes as reported previously (13).

Sugar-sweetened beverages may increase the risk of type 2
diabetes through several mechanisms. The ﬁrst is adiposity, which
is the most important risk factor for type 2 diabetes. Sugar-
sweetened beverages contain ’150 kcal per serving, which if
consumed in excess of daily energy balance may promote a 6.8-kg
annual weight gain (14). In small feeding studies, consumption
of sugar-sweetened beverages before meals leads to greater en-
ergy consumption than does consumption of water and other
beverages (15). This is attributed to the lower satiating effect
of liquids (16) and possibly to the high fructose content of sugar-

sweetened beverages (2). However, the mechanism underlying
these observations is unknown, and in recent trials sucrose-
sweetened beverages had the same effect on satiety as did
fructose-sweetened beverages or milk (17). Second, sugar-
sweetened beverages provide large quantities of easily absorb-
able sugars, which increase glycemic load and the insulin
response and may elevate type 2 diabetes risk above that pre-
dicted by total energy intake and adiposity alone (18). Third,
sugar-sweetened beverages contain additives that may in-
crease diabetes risk. For example, caramel coloring in cola
contains advanced glycation end products, which induces insulin
resistance in animal models (19).

In this study, and in a recent meta analysis by members of our
research group (4), sugar-sweetened beverages were signiﬁcantly
associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes after ad-
justment for confounders, including markers of diet quality. This
decreases the chance that sugar-sweetened beverages are markers
of a poor diet. Adjustment for total energy intake and BMI had
little effect, which suggests that they are not major mediators.

DE KONING ET AL

Artiﬁcially sweetened beverages are marketed as healthier than
sugar-sweetened beverages because they contain no sugar and
negligible calories. However in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Ath-
erosclerosis, Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities, and Fra-
mingham offspring prospective cohort studies, consumption of
artiﬁcially sweetened beverages was signiﬁcantly associated with
an increased risk of type 2 diabetes and the metabolic syndrome
(7–9). One explanation for these ﬁndings is that artiﬁcially
sweetened beverages stimulate appetite for sweet foods at sub-
sequent meals (20). However, reverse causation and confounding
are more plausible explanations. Individuals consuming artiﬁ-
cially sweetened beverages may be doing so in an attempt to lose
weight, or may have switched to artiﬁcially sweetened beverages
after gaining weight (21). They may also have switched in re-
sponse to a diagnosis of a chronic condition such as high tri-
glycerides, impaired fasting glucose, or high blood pressure (21).
The underlying health of these participants may therefore be
compromised, and their risk of type 2 diabetes increased.

In our study, participants consuming artiﬁcially sweetened
beverages were more likely to have reported either weight gain or
weight loss before the start of the study, to have tried a low-
calorie diet, and to have an elevated BMI at baseline. They were
also more likely to have a family history of type 2 diabetes, have
high triglycerides, have high blood pressure, use diuretics, and
take multivitamins—each of which was associated with an in-
creased risk of type 2 diabetes except for multivitamin use, which
was protective (data not shown). After adjusting for these factors
as well as for total energy intake and BMI, artiﬁcially sweetened
beverages were no longer signiﬁcantly associated with type 2
diabetes. This supports our hypothesis that participants use
artiﬁcially sweetened beverages as dieting aids or because of poor
health. A lack of adjustment for these factors may therefore have
contributed to illusory associations in other studies.

Our

results support

the replacement of sugar-sweetened
beverages with others such as artiﬁcially sweetened beverages,
low-fat milk, fruit juice, coffee, and tea. Water had a weak
association with type 2 diabetes, which could have been due to
residual confounding by unmeasured health conditions or medi-
cations related to diabetes risk and water consumption. The small
effect size of this association also suggests that it could be an
artifact. Low-fat milk was not associated with type 2 diabetes in
our study; however, an earlier analysis indicated that total low-fat
dairy is protective (22). This is consistent with other studies;
however, the mechanism is unknown (23).

Our results for fruit juice were surprising given that juices made
a similar contribution to glycemic load as sugar-sweetened bev-
erages (mean: 7.4% compared with 6.9% in 1986). In the Nurses’
Health Study I (24), but not in the Nurse Health Study II (25), fruit
juice intake was positively associated with type 2 diabetes risk.
Other prospective studies have similarly found both positive (26)
and null (27) associations. The reason for these discrepancies is
unknown, but may involve methodologic differences. For example,
the Nurses’ Health Study I has more assessments of fruit juice
intake than does the Nurses’ Health Study II (5 compared with 2)
and more cases of type 2 diabetes (4521 compared with 749) (24,
25). On the other hand, misclassiﬁcation of fruit juice with fruit-
ﬂavored sugar-sweetened beverages, which have a higher glycemic
index, could create a false association. In the Nurses’ Health Study I
and II, consumption of these beverages was associated with an
increased risk of type 2 diabetes (24, 25). Evidence also indicates

that consumption of a moderate amount of fruit juice may provide
some beneﬁts. For example, sugar-sweetened beverage consump-
tion is associated with a greater risk of inadequate intake of vitamins
E, A, and C and magnesium (28), which could be provided in part
by fruit juice (29). Fruit juice also contains antioxidants, such as
ﬂavonoids, which may improve long-term insulin sensitivity by
reducing inﬂammation (30). In a trial by Ghanim et al (31), fresh
orange juice prevented the rise in several proinﬂammatory cyto-
kines and reactive oxygen species after a high-carbohydrate, high-
fat meal. However, antioxidant content and antiinﬂammatory
properties vary enormously by fruit juice (32) and are likely af-
fected by freshness and processing (33). As such, further research is
needed to clarify the role of fruit juice in diabetes risk.

While substituting sugar-sweetened for artiﬁcially sweetened
beverages was not associated with excess risk, controversy still
surrounds their use. Aspartame is hypothesized to increase the risk
of neurologic deﬁcits or cancer because of its conversion to
methanol and formaldehyde (34). However, no convincing data
have been published to validate this hypothesis, and, in a recent
position statement, the American Dietetic Association has sup-
ported the use of artiﬁcial sweeteners in the US diet (35). In-
terestingly, in a recent analysis of a large Danish birth cohort study,
intake of artiﬁcially sweetened beverages was associated with
preterm birth, which is consistent with the effects of low-dose
methanol in animal models (36). Further research on the safety of
artiﬁcially sweetened beverages may therefore be warranted.

We found that substituting coffee for sugar-sweetened bev-
erages was associated with a substantial beneﬁt because of its
inverse association with type 2 diabetes risk. This relation is
consistent across many prospective cohort studies (37) and is
attributed to magnesium and ﬂavonoids, such as chlorogenic acid
(37). Two randomized trials over 8 wk (N Wedick, personal
communication, 2010) and 3 mo (38) suggest that coffee may
decrease inﬂammatory factors and increase adiponectin. Tea was
not associated with type 2 diabetes in our study, although its
intake was low compared with coffee. Others studies suggest that
tea might be similarly protective through an antioxidant mech-
anism (39).

Our study had several strengths. The ﬁrst is that beverage
intake was measured before the development of type 2 diabetes.
This minimizes reverse causality and recall bias. Second, par-
ticipants were similar in socioeconomic status, which reduces the
possibility of residual confounding as in studies of diverse
populations. Third, beverage intakes were calculated as cumu-
lative averages, which captures long-term intake and reduces
measurement error. Fourth, we controlled for several health and
lifestyle-related confounders throughout the follow-up and ex-
plored residual confounding by early weight change and dieting.
Fifth, the large sample size allowed for the detection of small but
potentially important changes in risk.

Our study had 2 major limitations. The ﬁrst was generaliz-
ability, because most of the participants were white men.
However, the consistency of our results in different strata sug-
gests that they may be reproducible in other studies. The second
major limitation was unmeasured and residual confounding,
which is a problem with all observational studies. However, we
adjusted for a wide range of potential confounders and used
continuous covariates to control residual confounding. We also
eliminated early cases of type 2 diabetes and performed lagged
analyses, which did not change the results.

BEVERAGE CONSUMPTION AND RISK OF T2D

1327

In conclusion, sugar-sweetened beverage consumption was
associated with a signiﬁcantly elevated risk of type 2 diabetes,
independent of lifestyle factors, whereas the association between
artiﬁcially sweetened beverages and diabetes risk was largely
explained by health status, pre-enrollment weight change, diet-
ing, and BMI. Substituting sugar-sweetened beverages with
coffee was associated with the greatest beneﬁt.
