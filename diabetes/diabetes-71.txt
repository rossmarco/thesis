Abstract Background and aims: We conducted a dose-response meta-analysis to summarize the
evidence from prospective cohort studies regarding the association of fruit and vegetable con-
sumption with risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).
Methods and results: Pertinent studies were identiﬁed by searching Embase and PubMed through
June 2014. Study-speciﬁc results were pooled using a random-effect model. The dose-response
relationship was assessed by the restricted cubic spline model and the multivariate random-
effect meta-regression. We standardized all data using a standard portion size of 106 g. The Rela-
tive Risk (95% conﬁdence interval) [RR (95% CI)] of T2DM was 0.99 (0.98e1.00) for every 1
serving/day increment in fruit and vegetable (FV) (P Z 0.18), 0.98 (0.95e1.01) for vegetable
(P Z 0.12), and 0.99 (0.97e1.00) for fruit (P Z 0.05). The RR (95%CI) of T2DM was 0.99 (0.97
e1.01), 0.98 (0.96e1.01), 0.97 (0.93e1.01), 0.96 (0.92e1.01), 0.96 (0.91e1.01) and 0.96 (0.91
e1.01) for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 servings/day of FV (Pfor non-linearity Z 0.44). The T2DM risk was
0.96 (0.95e0.99), 0.94 (0.90e0.98), 0.94 (0.89e0.98), 0.96 (0.91e1.01), 0.98 (0.92e1.05) and
1.00 (0.93e1.08) for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 servings/day of vegetable (Pfor non-linearity < 0.01). The
T2DM risk was 0.95 (0.93e0.97), 0.91 (0.89e0.94), 0.88 (0.85e0.92), 0.92 (0.88e0.96) and 0.96
(0.92e1.01) for 0.5, 1, 2, 3 and 4 servings/day of fruit (Pfor non-linearity < 0.01).
Conclusions: Two-three servings/day of vegetable and 2 servings/day of fruit conferred a lower
risk of T2DM than other levels of vegetable and fruit consumption, respectively.

Introduction

Worldwide, the cases of diabetes have increased from
nearly 150 million in 1980 to almost 350 million in 2008
[1] and to 382 million in 2013 [2], and this number is
expected to rise to 592 million by 2035 [2]. In China, it is

estimated that 92.4 million adults are afﬂicted with dia-
betes and 148.2 million adults with prediabetes, and a
large and highly variable proportion of cases are undiag-
nosed [3]. According to the reports of World Health Or-
ganization, 3.4 million people died from consequences of
high fasting blood glucose in 2004, and diabetes will be
the 7th leading cause of death in 2030, and type 2 diabetes
mellitus (T2DM) comprises 90% of people with diabetes
around the world (http://www.who.int/mediacentre/
factsheets/fs312/en/, accessed June 22, 2014). Increasing
fruit and vegetable (FV) consumption could improve the
overall diet proﬁle by increasing intakes of the micro-
nutrients, polyphenols and ﬁber, and FV also has a high

water content and a low energy content [4]. In addition, FV
consumption confers beneﬁcial effects on markers of
inﬂammation and oxidative stress [5]. Although a previous
meta-analysis [6] found no signiﬁcant beneﬁt of FV con-
sumption on T2DM risk, results from subsequent pro-
spective cohort studies [7e13] are inconsistent, and the
potential threshold effect of FV consumption on T2DM risk
is also unknown. Considering the popularity of FV con-
sumption as well as increasing prevalence and burden of
T2DM [14e17], even small health effect of FV consumption
on T2DM risk could have considerable public health con-
sequences, thus we conducted a dose-response meta-
analysis to quantitatively assess the effect of FV con-
sumption on T2DM risk.

Methods

Literature search and selection

We performed a literature search with PubMed (1950-
June, 2014) and Embase (1974-June, 2014) databases, using
the search term (((fruit*) OR vegetable*)) AND ((diabetes)
OR type 2 diabetes) without limitations. The reference lists
of retrieved articles were also scrutinized. For inclusion,
studies had to fulﬁll the following criteria: a prospective
cohort design; the exposure of
interest was FV; the
outcome of interest was T2DM; the number of cases and
participants or person-years and a risk estimate [eg, haz-
ard ratio, relative risk (RR) or odds ratio) with its 95%
conﬁdence interval (95% CI) for 3 or more quantitative
categories of FV consumption were provided. We reported
all results with RR, and hazard ratio and odds ratio [11]
were assumed to be equivalent or accurate estimates of
RR as did in previous meta-analysis [18,19]. With regards
to multiple publications and for the purpose of this dose-
response meta-analysis, the one providing the above-
mentioned data for dose-response analysis was included.
For multiple publications that both provided the data for
dose-response analysis, the one with FV, fruit and vege-
table (instead of speciﬁc types) as the exposure of interest
and the most number of participants was included.

Data extraction

The following data were extracted from each study: ﬁrst
author’s name, publication year, study location, follow-up
duration, sex, age, sample size, number of cases, methods
for measurement of FV consumption, number of cases and
participants (person-years) and RR (95% CI) for each level
of FV consumption, adjusted covariates. We extracted the
RR that reﬂected the greatest degree of adjustment for
confounding variables. For each study, the median level of
FV consumption for each category was assigned to each
corresponding RR estimate.
If upper boundary of the
highest category was not provided, we assumed that the
boundary had the same amplitude as the adjacent cate-
gory. We standardized all data into servings per day, using
a standard portion size of 106 g [6].

Statistical analysis

The study-speciﬁc RR (95% CI) for every 1 serving/day of
fruit and vegetable was ﬁrst estimated using the general-
ized least squares trend estimation [20], and then the in-
verse variance weighted mean of the logarithm of the
above-mentioned RR with 95% CI was calculated.

Heterogeneity was assessed with I2, and I2 values of 25,
50 and 75% represent low, moderate and high heteroge-
neity [21], respectively. Lower values of I2 mean the study-
speciﬁc trends of T2DM risk are more similar among the
included studies. Meta-regression and subgroup analysis
were conducted to explore potential sources of heteroge-
neity and perform comparisons between groups, and P
values from meta-regression were calculated with a per-
mutation test of 1000 to control the spurious ﬁndings [22].
Sensitivity analysis was performed with one study
removed at a time to evaluate the inﬂuence of individual
studies on the overall risk estimate. Publication bias was
evaluated using Egger test [23] and Begg test [24] at the
P < 0.10 level of signiﬁcance, and the trim and ﬁll method
[25] was used to incorporate the theoretical missing
studies when publication bias was indicated. Study quality
was assessed using the 9-star NewcastleeOttawa Scale
(http://www.ohri.ca/programs/clinical_epidemiology/
oxford.asp, accessed 3/12/2014).

For assessing a potential non-linear relationship, a 2-
stage random-effects dose-response meta-analysis [26]
was performed taking into account the between-study
heterogeneity. First, a restricted cubic spline model, with
3 knots at the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles of FV
consumption, was estimated taking into account the cor-
relation within each set of published RRs [20]. Then, we
combined the 2 regression coefﬁcients (3 knots minus 1)
within each study by the restricted maximum likelihood
method in a multivariate random-effects meta-analysis
[27]. A P value for non-linearity was calculated by testing
the null hypothesis that the coefﬁcient of the second spline
is equal to 0, and a non-linear relationship is indicated
when P value for non-linearity (Pfor non-linearity) 0.05. The
lowest value (the reference group) was set to 0 in all
analysis. The pooled risk of T2DM for each serving/day of
fruit and vegetable was derived using a procedure to
tabulate and plot results [28]. One study [11] reported the
association by sex, thus we combined these 2 estimates
with a ﬁxed-effect in the main analyses and combined
each estimate with other respective estimates in sex-
speciﬁc random-effects analyses. Stata 12.0 was used and
P  0.05 was considered statistically signiﬁcant (except for
the publication bias test). This meta-analysis was con-
ducted following the MOOSE criteria [29].

articles
[8,9,11,13,31,33,35] (27,998 T2DM cases among 391,148
subjects) were included, because 3 studies [Nurses’ Health
Study (NHS), Nurses’ Health Study II (NHS II), and Health
Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS)] were included in 1
article [9]. All included studies met the quality score of
6e8 stars (Supplementary Table 1), and the main quality
issues involved self-report of FV consumption, self-report
of T2DM without conﬁrmation,
follow-up duration of
less than 10 years and failure to report the rate of loss to
follow-up or the effect of loss to follow-up to the result. All
included studies adjusted for body mass index (BMI).
Detailed information of the included studies is shown in
Supplementary Table 2.

Quantitative synthesis

The main results are summarized in Table 1. Intakes at the
25th, 50th and 75th percentiles were 1.80, 4.00 and 5.97
servings/day for FV, 1.14, 2.27 and 3.50 servings/day for
vegetable, and 0.80, 1.45 and 2.40 servings/day for fruit,
respectively.

FV consumption and T2DM risk

The RR (95% CI) of T2DM was 0.99 (0.98e1.00, P Z 0.18,
Supplementary Fig. 2) for an increment of one serving/day
in FV (I2 Z 56.2%). No publication bias was detected in
both Egger (P Z 0.33) and Begg (P Z 0.37)
test
(Supplementary Fig. 3).

Compared with people who had no daily consumption
of FV, the RR (95% CI) of T2DM was 0.99 (0.97e1.01), 0.98
(0.96e1.01), 0.97 (0.93e1.01), 0.96 (0.92e1.01), 0.96
(0.91e1.01) and 0.96 (0.91e1.01) for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6
servings/day of FV consumption (Pfor non-linearity Z 0.44,
Fig. 1). 100% orange juice and 100% apple juice
were included as fruit consumption in 1 study [11], and
the results were similar after excluding this single study
[11].

Vegetable consumption and T2DM risk

The RR (95% CI) of T2DM was 0.98 (0.95e1.01, P Z 0.12,
Supplementary Fig. 2) for an increment of one serving/day
in vegetable (I2 Z 78.3%). No publication bias was detec-
ted in both Egger (P Z 0.15) and Begg (P Z 0.13) test
(Supplementary Fig. 3).

Compared with people who had no daily consumption
the RR (95% CI) of T2DM was 0.96
of vegetable,
(0.95e0.99), 0.94 (0.90e0.98), 0.94 (0.89e0.98), 0.96
(0.91e1.01), 0.98 (0.92e1.05) and 1.00 (0.93e1.08) for 1, 2,
3, 4, 5 and 6 servings/day of vegetable consumption (Pfor
non-linearity < 0.01, Fig. 2).

Fruit consumption and T2DM risk

The RR (95% CI) of T2DM was 0.99 (0.97e1.00, P Z 0.05,
Supplementary Fig. 2) for an increment of one serving/day
of FV (I2 Z 18.6%). No publication bias was detected in
both Egger (P Z 0.68) and Begg (P Z 0.47)
test
(Supplementary Fig. 3).

Compared with people who had no daily consumption
of fruit, the RR (95% CI) of T2DM was 0.95 (0.93e0.97), 0.91
(0.88e0.94), 0.88 (0.85e0.92), 0.92 (0.89e0.96), 0.96
(0.92e1.01) and 0.97 (0.92e1.03) for 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 4.2
(the highest level) servings/day of
fruit consumption,
respectively (Pfor non-linearity < 0.01, Fig. 3). 100% orange
juice and 100% apple juice were included as fruit con-
sumption in 1 study [11], and the results were similar after
excluding this single study [11].

Subgroup, meta-regression and sensitivity analyses

As shown in Supplementary Table 3, moderate to high
heterogeneity was found in the analysis for FV and

A previous meta-analysis [6] found that highest vs.
lowest category conferred an HR (95% CI) of 0.91
(0.76e1.09) for vegetable (5 studies), 0.93 (0.83e1.01) for
fruit (5 studies), 1.00 (0.92e1.09) for total FV (4 studies),
and 0.86 (0.77e0.97) for green leafy vegetable (4 studies).
A marginal association was found between T2DM risk and
highest [0.93 (0.87e1.00)] category of FV (5 studies), and a
signiﬁcant association was found for green leafy vegetable,
while no association was found for fruit (6 studies) and for
vegetable (6 studies) [13]. Categories of FV consumption
differed between studies, which could complicate the
interpretation of pooled results across study populations
with different categories. In this respect, a dose-response
meta-analysis with restricted cubic spline functions pro-
vides a solution to the problem from which a summary
risk estimate can be derived for speciﬁc exposure values
[36]. Therefore, we conducted a dose-response meta-
analysis to assess the association of T2DM risk with
vegetable (7 studies), fruit (9 studies) and FV (7 studies).
The different number of subjects included and different
statistical method should explain the different ﬁndings
with previous meta-analysis.

Obesity is one of the most established risk factors for
T2DM development [37], and FV consumption is inversely
associated with weight development [38,39]. FV has a high
ﬁber content that is inversely associated with T2DM risk
[40]. FV is the important source of dietary potassium, and
low dietary potassium increased T2DM risk [41].
Increasing FV consumption increases intakes of micro-
nutrient and ﬁber, whereas decreases fat intake [4,42].
Therefore, health beneﬁts of FV consumption are likely to
act through an improvement in the overall diet proﬁle [4].
The risk of T2DM did not decrease further after 2e3
servings/day of vegetable and 2 servings/day of
fruit.
Possible mechanisms might involve the availability of
nutrients and the digestibility of fruit and vegetable [43].
In addition, fructose could decrease insulin sensitivity and
increase risk factors of metabolic syndrome, which results
from de novo lipogenesis and increased uric acid levels
during the metabolism of fructose [44e46]. For vegetable
and fruit, the dose-response relationship suggested a
continued increase in RR beyond 3 servings/day, which
might also be partially attributed to the accompanying
higher consumption of fruit juice [34], because sugar-
sweetened fruit juice is positively associated with T2DM
risk [47].

Moderate to high heterogeneity was found for FV and
vegetable analysis. However, results from meta-regression
in exploring the potential sources of heterogeneity were
not consistent. Dietary intake was assessed at baseline,
and subjects might change their dietary habits during
follow-up. Although there is modest to good validity for
the FFQ used in the included studies [48,49], FFQ tends to
overestimate the intake level of FV than 24-h dietary re-
calls [48] and 7-day diet diary [50], and validity of FFQ
varies among countries [49]. Standardization of nutritional
epidemiology and use of biological markers are needed.
We used the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale that has been
adopted in systematic reviews of nonrandomized studies

risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus. The solid line and the long dash line
represent the estimated relative risk and its 95% conﬁdence interval.

vegetable, and low heterogeneity was found for fruit
analysis. Therefore, subgroup analysis and meta-regression
were conducted to explore potential sources of heteroge-
neity. For FV, dietary assessment method contributed
signiﬁcantly (P Z 0.03) to heterogeneity, and the associ-
ation was 0.97 (0.95e0.99, I2 Z 17.1%) for FV assessed by
food-frequency questionnaire (FFQ), and 1.02 (0.97e1.04,
I2 Z 0.00%) by other methods. For vegetable, study loca-
tion contributed signiﬁcantly (P < 0.01) to heterogeneity,
and the association was 1.01 (0.99e1.02, I2 Z 0.00%) for
studies conducted in USA, 0.96 (0.93e1.00, I2 Z 0.00%) in
Europe and 0.93 (0.88e0.98, I2 Z 44.4%) in Asia. For fruit,
follow-up duration contributed signiﬁcantly (P < 0.01) to
heterogeneity, and the association was 0.97 (0.96e0.99)
and 1.00 (0.99e1.02) for studies with a follow-up duration
of 10 and <10 years, respectively. No signiﬁcant ﬁndings
were found in other subgroup analysis. The inconsistent
ﬁndings for sources of heterogeneity across FV, vegetable
and fruit might be susceptible to the relatively small
number of studies. In addition, in the included studies,
Europeans [13] and Asians [11,35] did not consume more
FV than Americans [9,31,33]. Sensitivity analysis showed
that no individual study had an excessive inﬂuence on the
above-mentioned pooled effect (Supplementary Fig. 4).
Consuming about 2e3 servings/day of vegetable conferred
a lower T2DM risk than other levels was also observed in
some subgroup analysis. Consuming 2 servings/day of fruit
conferred a lower T2DM risk than other levels were also
observed in most subgroup analysis.

Discussion

This meta-analysis showed that although total FV con-
sumption was not signiﬁcantly associated with T2DM risk,
there was a threshold around 2-3 servings/day of vege-
table and 2 servings/day of fruit, after which the T2DM risk
did not reduce further. The ﬁndings are consistent with the
general recommendation to consume ﬁve servings of fruit
and vegetable a day (3 servings/day of vegetable and 2
servings/day of fruit).

[51] to assess the study quality score, and signiﬁcant (or
marginally) association was found among studies with
higher quality scores. Although the validity and reliability
of this scale still need to be improved [52], studies with
higher quality scores were generally characterized with
larger number of subjects, more accurate assessment of
exposure and outcome, longer follow-up duration, and a
higher follow-up rate.

Other limitations are as follows: First, although dietary
under-reporting and selective recall (of healthier foods)
can be a problem with dietary assessment in prospective
cohort studies, these studies are the best evidence avail-
able because there are very few reliable biomarkers of diet
as yet and long-term randomized trials are difﬁcult to
implement. In addition, FFQ is a reasonable tool to assess
FV intakes in validation studies [53,54]. Second, dietary
constituents are not consumed in isolation. Although we
extracted RRs that were adjusted for the most con-
founders, the extent to which they were adjusted and re-
sidual confounding should also be considered, like dairy
foods [55], coffee and tea consumption [56,57], etc. High-
est adherence to healthy dietary patterns confers a relative
risk of 0.80 (0.74e0.86) [58], and all of the deﬁned healthy
dietary patterns include FV, and some also consider whole
grains, ﬁsh, poultry and meat/red meat [58]. Third, the
dose-response analysis for speciﬁc types of
fruit and
vegetable were not conducted because of limited data.
Highest vs. lowest intake of green leafy vegetable was
found inversely associated with T2DM risk [0.86
(0.77e0.97)] in a previous meta-analysis [6]. A previous
study [9] including populations from 3 cohorts (NHS, NHS
II, and HPFS) found that grapes and raisins, bananas, ap-
ples and pears, grapefruit and blueberries were inversely
associated with T2DM risk, while cantaloupe was posi-
tively associated with T2DM risk. Fourth, prospective
cohort studies rely on nutritional assessment methods
with validity and reliability being lower compared to the
randomized controlled trial, which is the ultimate criteria
for causation [59]-that random allocation to FV realizes a
reduction in T2DM incidence compared with random
allocation to placebo. Randomized controlled trials would
also have minimized the residual confounding; however,
these long-term randomized trials are difﬁcult to imple-
ment on a practical basis. Last, there are some discrep-
ancies regarding the standard portion size of fruit and
vegetable. For example, the current UK recommendation
to consume ﬁve servings of fruit and vegetables a day is
based on 80 g as a serving size [6]. In this meta-analysis,
we used 106 g as serving size, which is consistent previ-
ous meta-analysis [6,60].

In conclusion, 2e3 servings/day of vegetable and 2
servings/day of fruit should be recommended for T2DM
prevention. Further studies are needed to assess the effect
of speciﬁc types of fruit and vegetable on T2DM risk.
