ORIGINAL INVESTIGATION

Coffee Consumption and Risk
of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus

An 11-Year Prospective Study of 28 812 Postmenopausal Women

Mark A. Pereira, PhD; Emily D. Parker, MPH; Aaron R. Folsom, MD

Background: Coffee intake may be associated with re-
duced risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus because of minerals,
phytochemicals, and antioxidants in coffee, but the role of
caffeine is unclear. Our objective was to examine the as-
sociation between total, caffeinated, and decaffeinated cof-
fee intake, as assessed by food frequency questionnaire at
baseline, and risk of incident type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Methods: This prospective analysis of the Iowa Wom-
en’s Health Study (1986-1997) included 28 812 post-
menopausal women free of diabetes and cardiovascular
disease in the general community. The main outcome
measure was incident type 2 diabetes mellitus as deter-
mined by mailed questionnaire.

Results: Coffee intake was categorized as 0 , less than 1,
1 to 3, 4 to 5, and 6 or more cups per day. During 11 years
of follow-up, there were 1418 incident cases of diabetes.

Relative risks (RRs) were adjusted for a variety of demo-
graphic, adiposity, and lifestyle measures. Compared with
women who reported 0 cups of coffee per day, women who
consumed 6 or more cups per day had a 22% lower risk
(RR=0.78; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.61-1.01) of dia-
betes (P for linear trend across categories, .06). This as-
sociation appeared to be largely explained by decaffein-
ated coffee (RR=0.67; 95% CI, 0.42-1.08; P for trend, .006)
rather than regular coffee (RR=0.79; 95% CI, 0.59-1.05;
P for trend, .90). Intake of magnesium and phytate did not
explain these associations. Intakes of caffeine from all
sources was not associated with risk of diabetes.

Conclusion: Coffee intake, especially decaffeinated, was
inversely associated with risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus
in this cohort of postmenopausal women.

S EVERAL LARGE PROSPECTIVE

studies have reported an in-
verse association between cof-
fee consumption and risk of
type 2 diabetes mellitus.1-5 A
recent systematic review on this topic con-
cluded that this association between cof-
fee intake and risk of type 2 diabetes melli-
tus is consistent across age, obesity, and
study location (United States and Eu-
rope).6 The associations were relatively
strong, followed a dose-response relation
(higher coffee intake, lower diabetes inci-
dence), and appeared to be independent of
potentially confounding dietary and life-
style factors. Purported mechanisms that
may explain this association, if causal, in-
clude effects on insulin sensitivity and/or
insulin secretion from a variety of miner-
als, antioxidants, and phytochemical com-
pounds found in coffee.7,8 However, it re-
mains unclear whether the caffeine itself
may increase or decrease the risk of type 2
diabetes mellitus and therefore whether ef-
fects may differ between regular and de-
caffeinated coffee.3,9-12

The purpose of the present study was
to examine the association between cof-
fee drinking habits and risk of type 2 dia-
betes mellitus in a large prospective study
of postmenopausal women from the state
of Iowa. Our study afforded the opportu-
nity to determine if the findings from the
previous studies would also be found in a
relatively homogeneous cohort of older
women with relatively high intakes of both
regular coffee and decaffeinated coffee.

METHODS

RESEARCH DESIGN

The Iowa Women’s Health Study is a prospec-
tive cohort study of postmenopausal women
residing in the state of Iowa. In January 1986,
a random sample of 99 826 women aged 55 to
69 years with a valid Iowa driver’s license were
mailed a 16-page questionnaire and invited to
participate in the study. The original study
sample consisted of 41 836 women who re-
turned the baseline questionnaire. Compared
with nonrespondents, respondents had a lower

grams divided by the square of height in meters) (0.4 lower),
were 3 months older, and were more likely to live in rural and
less affluent counties compared with nonrespondents.13

Women were excluded from our analysis if they reported im-
plausibly high (⬎5000 kcal) or low (⬍600 kcal) energy in-
takes, left 30 or more items blank on the food frequency ques-
tionnaire, or had diabetes, cardiovascular disease, or cancer (other
than nonmelanoma skin cancer) at baseline, or were unsure
whether they had diabetes. Women were considered to have dia-
betes at baseline if they responded yes to 1 of the following ques-
tions: (1) have you ever been told by a doctor that you have sugar
diabetes? and (2) have you ever taken insulin or pills for sugar
diabetes (or to lower blood glucose)? After these exclusions,
28 812 women were included in the present analyses.

Diabetes incidence was determined by self-report using the
following question asked on 4 follow-up mailed surveys in 1987,
1989, 1992, and 1997: “Since baseline (or most recent follow-
up), were you diagnosed for the first time by a doctor as hav-
ing sugar diabetes?” Response rates for the 4 follow-up sur-
veys were 91%, 89%, 86%, and 79%, respectively. A validation
study of self-reported diabetes was conducted on 85 cohort par-
ticipants in 1988 after the first follow-up survey. Subjects tended
to overreport having diabetes; of 44 women who reported hav-
ing diabetes at baseline, 28 (64%) were confirmed as having
diabetes by their physician. All 41 women who reported not
having diabetes at baseline were confirmed noncases.14

The baseline questionnaire included questions on known
or suspected risk factors for diabetes, such as age, BMI, waist-
hip ratio (WHR), physical activity, alcohol consumption, and
smoking history. Weight and height were self-reported, and
WHR was calculated as the mean of 2 measurements taken by
the participant’s spouse or friend using a paper tape measure
that was included with the questionnaire.15 The women re-
ported their frequency of moderate (eg, golf and long walks)
and vigorous (eg, swimming and aerobics) physical activity, and
these were combined into a simple 3-level index of total physi-
cal activity (low, moderate, and high).16 Pack-years of smok-
ing was calculated from the intensity and duration of cigarette
smoking. Alcohol consumption was assessed by the food fre-
quency questionnaire, which queried the participants’ typical
intakes of wine, beer, and spirits. The women also provided in-
formation on their marital status, educational attainment, resi-
dence, and use of hormone therapy.

A 127-item food frequency questionnaire was used to as-
sess past-year typical food intake.17 Women were asked “Please
fill in your average use during the past year, of each specified
food.” For “decaffeinated coffee” and “coffee,” the standard serv-
ing size was assigned on the questionnaire as “1 cup,” and the
intake frequency options ranged from “never or less than once
per month” up to “6 or more cups per day.” The validity of the
food frequency questionnaire was evaluated by comparing nu-
trient values with those from the average of five 24-hour di-
etary recall surveys in 44 study participants.18 Reliability was
evaluated by readministering the questionnaire 3 to 6 months
later. The validity correlations for caffeine were r=0.95 (only
alcohol was higher) and r=0.82 (only riboflavin was higher),
respectively.

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS

The SAS version 9.1 package was used for all statistical analy-
ses (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC). Person-time-at-risk was cal-
culated from baseline to the date of the last completed fol-
low-up survey for women who did not report a diagnosis of
diabetes. For women who reported a diabetes diagnosis, person-
time was calculated as the sum of the known disease-free pe-

riod and half of the period during which the diagnosis was made.
Relative risks (RRs) per category of coffee intake were esti-
mated by Cox proportional hazards regression models (PROC
PHREG; SAS Institute Inc) with simultaneous adjustment for
many demographic, lifestyle, and dietary variables. Coffee cat-
egories were based on round and logical daily intake cut points
that would also provide an ample number of participants and
cases per category. Linear trend tests for the RRs across in-
crease coffee intake categories were computed by reparameter-
ization of the categorical coffee variables as if they were con-
tinuous. Three models were constructed, with only the final
model including some components of coffee that may be on
the causal pathway between coffee intake and risk of type 2 dia-
betes mellitus. Model 1 included baseline age (continuous), edu-
cation (high school graduate vs not), and baseline hyperten-
sion (yes vs no). Model 2 included those variables in model 1,
plus alcohol (0, ⬍4g/d, and ⱖ4 g/d), smoking status (smoker
vs not), cigarette pack-years (quartiles), BMI (continuous), WHR
(continuous), physical activity (high, moderate, and low), en-
ergy intake (kilocalories per day, continuous), and intake of
total fat (grams per day, continuous), fatty acids and choles-
terol level (Keys score, continuous), cereal fiber (grams per day,
quintiles), tea (servings per day, quartiles), and sugar-
sweetened beverages (servings per day, quintiles). Finally, model
3 included those variables in model 2, plus dietary intake of
magnesium (milligrams per day, quintiles) and phytate (mil-
ligrams per day, quintiles).

RESULTS

Table 1 includes the levels of coffee intake in this co-
hort, as well as intakes of other beverages and of caf-
feine. Nearly half the cohort (n=14 224; mean intake, 2.3
cups per day) reported consuming 1 to 3 cups of coffee
per day, with fewer reporting no coffee consumption
(n=2928) and 2875 reporting 6 or more cups per day
(mean=6.5 cups per day). Regular coffee was more com-
mon than decaffeinated coffee, especially at high levels
of coffee intake. Coffee and tea were found to be in-
versely correlated, whereas there appeared to be only a
weak inverse association between soda (primarily sugar-
sweetened carbonated beverages) intake and coffee in-
take. As expected, we observed a strong direct associa-
tion between coffee intake and caffeine intake. Regular
coffee drinkers tended to report less skim milk in their
diets compared with coffee abstainers. Median intakes
of whole milk and cream were 0 within each coffee cat-
egory. Linear regression revealed statistically signifi-
cant (P⬍.05) associations between coffee intake and all
variables except soda and whole milk.

The baseline characteristics of the cohort by level of cof-
fee consumption are given in Table 2. Generally, higher
coffee intake was associated with lower BMI and WHRs,
with higher consumption of alcohol and cigarettes, and
with lower prevalence of vigorous activity and hyperten-
sion. Coffee intake was positively correlated with energy
intake and all types of fat and inversely correlated with di-
etary fiber intake. Coffee intake was inversely associated
with intake of fruit and low-fat dairy and positively asso-
ciated with high-fat dairy. Finally, coffee intake was posi-
tively associated with intakes of magnesium and phytate.
These associations were not materially different, without
exception, when analyzed separately for caffeinated cof-
fee and for decaffeinated coffee.

Relative risks for incident type 2 diabetes mellitus by
category of coffee consumption are given in Table 3 for
3 different regression models. In model 1, adjusted for
age, education, and baseline hypertension status, we ob-
served a linear dose-response inverse association be-
tween coffee intake and diabetes risk (P⬍.001). Women
who reported drinking 6 or more cups per day had a 34%
reduction in risk of diabetes (RR=0.66; 95% confidence
interval [CI], 0.52-0.84) compared with those report-
ing no coffee intake. This association was attenuated by
further adjustment in model 2 for a variety of other an-
thropometric, lifestyle, and dietary factors (RR=0.78; 95%

CI, 0.61-1.01; P for linear trend, .06). The inverse asso-
ciations between coffee intake and diabetes risk were
stronger for decaffeinated coffee than for regular (caf-
feinated) coffee. Indeed, in model 2 there no longer ap-
peared to be an association between caffeinated coffee and
diabetes risk, whereas the association between decaffein-
ated coffee and diabetes risk was only marginally attenu-
ated by anthropometric and lifestyle factors. In addi-
tion, the association between total coffee intake and
diabetes risk was completely explained by adjustment for
intake of decaffeinated coffee (data not shown). Further
adjustment for intake of magnesium and phytate in model

and cream. In the full model 3, we observed a possible
reduction in risk for women in the highest category of
tea intake (ⱖ4 servings per day: RR = 0.64; 95% CI, 0.40-
1.03) relative to the lowest (0 servings per day), whereas
intermediate levels of tea intake appeared to confer no
protection (quartile 2 [⬎1 serving per day], RR = 1.01
[95% CI, 0.86-1.19]; quartile 3 [1-3 servings per day],
RR = 1.02 [95% CI, 0.91-1.15]).

COMMENT

Among postmenopausal women living in the state of Iowa
and followed over 11 years from 1986 to 1997, we ob-
served a dose-response inverse association between in-
take of coffee, particularly decaffeinated coffee, and the
risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus. When we computed sepa-
rate models for regular coffee and for decaffeinated cof-
fee, the inverse associations were considerably stronger
for decaffeinated coffee than for regular (caffeinated) cof-
fee. Indeed, in contrast to the findings of other observa-

tional studies,3 caffeine intake did not appear to be as-
sociated with diabetes risk in our study. While the
association between caffeinated coffee and diabetes risk
was confounded by adiposity and lifestyle factors, the as-
sociation between decaffeinated coffee and diabetes risk
was only moderately attenuated after these adjust-
ments. That is, the association between decaffeinated cof-
fee and diabetes appeared to be independent of many other
potentially confounding anthropometric, lifestyle, and di-
etary factors, such as physical activity, BMI, and cereal
fiber. This association did not appear to be explained by
adjustment for 2 coffee components, magnesium and
phytate, that were in our database.

At least 10 prior prospective cohort studies from the
Netherlands,2,19 Finland,1,20,21 Sweden,4 and the United
States3,5,22 have examined the association between cof-
fee consumption habits and risk of type 2 diabetes melli-
tus. Seven of these studies reported inverse associations
between coffee intake and risk of type 2 diabetes melli-
tus,1-5,19,21 although 2 of these were small underpowered
studies.4,19 Tuomilehto and colleagues1 examined this
question in a cohort study from Finland, a population
with the highest coffee consumption in the world. More
than 14 629 men and women were studied for an aver-
age follow-up period of 12 years, beginning in 1982. A
strong inverse association between coffee intake and risk
of type 2 diabetes mellitus was observed, independent
of many other lifestyle and dietary factors, and with no
apparent threshold for the risk reduction with very high
intakes. That is, men and women who reported coffee

the lowest RRs for type 2 diabetes mellitus (0.45 [95%
CI, 0.25-0.81] for men and 0.21 [95% CI, 0.06-0.69] for
women). The study did not, however, examine intake of
decaffeinated coffee, presumably because the consump-
tion of decaffeinated coffee was very low in the Finnish
population. The results of the Finnish Twin Cohort Study
also observed an inverse, albeit weaker, association be-
tween coffee intake and diabetes incidence,21 while one
older Finnish study on this topic reported no associa-
tion between coffee intake and diabetes risk.20

Magnesium, for which coffee is a good source, could
explain some of the inverse association between coffee
intake and risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus through known
beneficial effects on carbohydrate metabolism.23-26 How-
ever, when we entered magnesium into the final model,
there was no attenuation of the RRs as one would have
expected through causal mediation. Caffeine could not
explain our findings because the association was essen-
tially limited to decaffeinated coffee, and caffeine intake
was not associated with diabetes risk. Our findings of a
weak association between caffeinated coffee and diabe-
tes and no association between caffeine intake and dia-
betes risk is at odds with the inverse associations re-
ported by the US Nurses Health Study and Health
Professionals Follow-up study.3 Perhaps high caffeine in-
take carries more detrimental effects in older adults than
in middle aged adults, or perhaps the association be-
tween caffeine and diabetes in the present study was con-
founded by some unmeasured or poorly measured fac-
tor. Indeed, the literature is mixed on whether caffeine
may increase or decrease risk for type 2 diabetes melli-
tus, with both scenarios being plausible.3,9-12 Thus, we are
left with the question of how coffee consumption, par-
ticularly decaffeinated coffee, could reduce the risk of dia-
betes. Certainly, the coffee bean is known to be a rich
source of many minerals and phytochemicals, includ-
ing polyphenols such as chlorogenic acid and phytic acid
that may improve postprandial carbohydrate metabo-
lism through a variety of possible mechanisms.8 For ex-
ample, chlorogenic acid may reduce intestinal absorp-
tion of glucose27 and inhibit gut incretin hormones,28,29
while in the liver chlorogenic acid may inhibit glucose-
6-phosphatase activity.30,31 These mechanisms would be
expected to attenuate blood glucose concentrations and
possibly reduce the risk or delay the onset of type 2 dia-
betes mellitus. Furthermore, coffee may have powerful
antioxidant properties7 that could potentially protect the
pancreatic beta cell from oxidative stress or promote in-
sulin sensitivity in the peripheral tissues, thereby delay-
ing or preventing the onset of type 2 diabetes mellitus.
Based on data available on the antioxidant content of foods
(as assessed by the ferric-reducing ability of plasma as-
say) and on food consumption data, a study of the Nor-
wegian diet found coffee to contribute more antioxi-
dants compared with any other dietary component.32
Unfortunately, typical nutritional data sources such as
ours do not include the vast, although poorly under-
stood, phytochemicals and other components of plant-
based foods and beverages. Therefore, with the excep-
tion of phytate, which was not associated with diabetes
risk in our study, we were unable to assess the possibil-

ity that these naturally occurring chemicals might ex-
plain the link between coffee intake and diabetes risk.
Our study has several limitations. Most notably, our
findings are based on observational self-reported data.
Both the exposure (diet) and the outcome were based on
self-report, leaving possibilities for biases relative to stud-
ies with objective measures and studies using experi-
mental designs. We cannot rule out residual confound-
ing as an explanation for our findings. However, it should
be noted that measurement error resulting in nondiffer-
ential misclassification would tend to bias results to-
ward the null hypothesis. As such, it is possible that our
findings underestimate the true strength of association.
For these reasons, we cannot rule out that a true inverse
association between caffeinated coffee and diabetes risk
may exist in this population.

In summary, we observed an inverse association be-
tween coffee consumption, especially decaffeinated cof-
fee consumption, and the risk of type 2 diabetes melli-
tus over an 11-year period in postmenopausal women
residing in the state of Iowa. Although this study sug-
gests that the causal mechanism for this association may
not be caffeine, magnesium, or phytate, this study was
not equipped to thoroughly explore possible causal
mechanisms for this association. Although the first line
of prevention for diabetes is exercise and diet, in light of
the popularity of coffee consumption and high rates of
type 2 diabetes mellitus in older adults, these findings
may carry high public health significance.

Call for Papers

Preventive Intervention Theme Issue

In an effort to encourage research on the topic, a special
issue of the ARCHIVES will be devoted to papers on the
topic of preventive interventions. Specifically, we are
interested in receiving papers focused on the efficacy or
effectiveness of interventions. While we will primarily
concentrate on randomized controlled trials that assess
efficacy, we will also consider papers that employ obser-
vational methods of investigation or economic analyses
that reasonably estimate theoretical cost-effectiveness of
interventions. All kinds of preventive interventions are
welcomed—those in the community, in medical offices,
in clinics, and in hospitals or other advanced-care set-
tings. However, priority for this theme issue will be
given to those papers that are applicable to the practic-
ing internist.

Papers for the preventive intervention theme issue
should be submitted no later than October 1, 2006. Pend-
ing completion of our peer review process, papers that
are accepted for publication will appear in an issue of
the Archives of Internal Medicine in the first half of 2007.
