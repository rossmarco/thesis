Abstract

The prevalence of obesity has grown to an alarming level of at least 300 million people worldwide. Additionally, a diabetes epidemic is
underway, with an estimate of 217 million people with diabetes worldwide. There are many links between excessive body weight and type 2
diabetes, and one common and fundamental cause of both epidemics is an unhealthy diet. Research to identify and promote diets that protect
individuals from obesity and type 2 diabetes is urgently needed. The Mediterranean diet, a concept developed in the 1950s, refers to dietary
habits of individuals from the Mediterranean basin. The Mediterranean diet is an eating pattern that successfully combines pleasant taste and
positive health effects. The Mediterranean diet does not stand for a homogenous and exclusive model among the Mediterranean basin
population but rather represents a set of healthy dietary habits, including high consumption of vegetables and fresh fruits and the use of olive
oil as the main source of fat. Evidence from epidemiological studies supports a protective effect of this dietary pattern on weight gain and the
development of type 2 diabetes. Several mechanistic explanations link characteristic components of the Mediterranean diet with obesity and
type 2 diabetes. This review will discuss potential mechanisms by which the Mediterranean diet protects individuals from both diseases.

1. Introduction

The worldwide obesity epidemic seems to be unstoppa-
ble in spite of considerable efforts that have been made to
combat this disease [1]. At present, more than 300 million
people worldwide are obese [body mass index (BMI) of
30 kg/m2 or higher]. The prevalence of obesity steadily
increased over the past four decades in the United States [2],
from around 13% to 30% or nearly one third of American
adults. In many European countries, a similar trend can be
observed, although the absolute level of obesity prevalence
has not yet reached the U.S. level [3–9].

The increasing trend in obesity is accompanied by a
growing incidence of diabetes [10,11]. Long considered a
disease of minor significance, in the 21st century, diabetes is
one of the main threats to human health [12]. Type 2
diabetes, formerly called non-insulin-dependent diabetes
mellitus or adult-onset diabetes, accounts for most cases of
diabetes worldwide. In 2000, an estimated 150 million

individuals worldwide are suffering from diabetes; this count
is likely to double by 2025 [13]. The close relationship
between obesity and diabetes has led to the adoption of the
term diabesity [14].

that

The fact

the incidence of obesity and type 2
diabetes has so recently and drastically increased points to
changes in lifestyle. The loss of traditional dietary habits,
increasing consumption of energy-dense foods and increas-
ing portion sizes, together with less physical activity at
work and/or during leisure time, are strongly associated
with the explosive increase of these diseases. However,
lifestyle factors such as diet and physical activity are
modifiable and disease manifestation from these factors is
largely preventable.

During the last few years, a great effort has been made to
examine the relationship between health and overall diet.
Pattern analysis examines the effects of diet rather than
focusing on individual nutrients or foods. Conceptually,
dietary patterns represent a broader picture of food and
nutrient consumption and may therefore be more predictive
of disease risk. Epidemiological evidence suggests that
several dietary patterns have been favorably associated with

the prevention of obesity and type 2 diabetes [15–18]. A
common characteristic of these dietary patterns is their
abundant plant food content.

The Mediterranean diet was first described in the 1960s
by Angel Keys, based on his observation of food habits of
some populations in the Mediterranean region [19]. The
Mediterranean diet observed by Keys was based on a large
variety of foods, mostly of vegetable (and not of animal)
origin. This dietary pattern, however, varies among regions
of the Mediterranean basin. The whole fat content, for
example, may vary from less than 30% to about 40%.
Nevertheless, a high consumption of foods of vegetable
origin, such as fruits, vegetables,
legumes, nuts, cereals
and olive oil, and, on the other hand, a low consumption
of meat and sausages could be considered important
characteristics of
this dietary pattern. Although the
Mediterranean diet has long been celebrated for its impact
on cardiovascular health [20], mounting epidemiological
evidence indicates a favorable effect on obesity and
diabetes [21–27] as well. However,
there is little dis-
cussion in the literature that explains these healthy effects
of the Mediterranean diet, particularly for obesity. There-
fore, the objective of the present review was to discuss
potential mechanisms by which the Mediterranean diet
prevents obesity and diabetes.

2. Epidemiological evidence of the preventive role of the
Mediterranean diet on obesity and type 2 diabetes

Few epidemiological studies have addressed the question
the Mediterranean diet produces favorable
of whether
effects in preventing obesity and diabetes. Recently, we
reported an inverse association of BMI and the Mediterra-
nean diet
in a representative Mediterranean Spanish
population [23]. Furthermore, we found a reduced risk of
being obese with higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet
pattern. Interestingly, this was independent of whether olive
oil is included in the Mediterranean diet or not. However,
Trichopoulou et al. [22] observed no essential relationship
between adherence to the Mediterranean diet and BMI in a
large general Greek population sample. Furthermore, a
longitudinal analysis of Spanish men and women showed
that subjects with a high adherence to the Mediterranean
diet have lower crude increments of weight during 2 years
of follow-up [21].

Following a Mediterranean-style diet in a randomized
intervention trial over 54 months improved endothelial
function and significantly reduced waist circumference,
plasma glucose, serum insulin and homeostasis model
assessment (HOMA) score in metabolic syndrome patients
[25]. Toobert et al. [26] examined in a randomized clinical
trial the effectiveness of a Mediterranean lifestyle program
(low-saturated-fat diet, stress management training, exercise
together with smoking cessation) in
and group support,
reducing cardiovascular
risk factors in postmenopausal
women with type 2 diabetes. They found greater improve-

ments in HbA1c, BMI and lipid profile in the intervention
group as compared with the control group. A recently
published study showed a decrease in several cardiovascular
risk factors such as glycemia,
insulinemia or HOMA,
among others, after following a Mediterranean-type diet
for 3 months [27]. Spanish investigators showed an
improvement
in glucose metabolism after administration
of a Mediterranean-type diet [24]. These studies point to a
favorable effect of Mediterranean-type diets on weight
maintenance and risk factors associated with diabetes
outcome, although they do not specify the mechanisms by
which it occurs.

3. Mechanisms inversely linking the Mediterranean diet
to excessive weight

3.1. Effect of the Mediterranean diet on satiation and satiety

3.1.1. Dietary fiber

There is no doubt that an imbalance between energy
expenditure and energy consumption causes weight gain.
Too much energy-dense food consumption and too little
physical activity worsen the obesity epidemic. Regulation of
food intake is a complex process, influenced not only by
food intake but also by various environmental and
psychological factors [28,29]. The effects of food intake
on hunger, satiation (the satisfaction of appetite that
develops during the course of eating and eventually results
in the cessation of eating) and satiety (the sensation that
determines the intermeal period of fasting) are of particular
importance for energy consumption.

Overconsumption is facilitated through palatable energy-
dense food that disrupts appetite regulation [30]. According
to the definition of the Institute of Medicine of the National
Academies, dietary fiber consists of bnon-digestible carbo-
hydrates and lignin that are intrinsic and intact in plants.Q
In general, dietary fiber may help regulate body weight
through its intrinsic effects and hormonal
responses.
Dietary fiber has long been regarded as a satiation and
satiety factor and has long been linked to calorie intake
[31,32]. Experimental studies showed that high fiber intake
increases satiety or reduces hunger in comparison to low
fiber intake, control or placebo treatment [31]. Addition-
ally, the majority of studies investigating the effect of high-
fiber diets on energy intake and weight loss reported a
reduction in both. Diets rich in plant foods, such as the
Mediterranean diet, provide a high amount of, as well as a
variety of, both soluble and insoluble dietary fiber.

There are several mechanisms by which dietary fiber
may exert its effects on satiation and satiety. Foods rich in
dietary fiber might promote satiation through prolonged
mastication. Experimental animal studies showed that
mastication is important for energy metabolism [33,34].
Mastication leads to an activation of hypothalamic hista-
mine neurons. H1 receptors located in the satiety centers of
the ventromedial hypothalamus and the paraventricular

H. Schro¨der / Journal of Nutritional Biochemistry 18 (2007) 149–160

151

nucleus are suppressed through histamine neuron activa-
tion. This affects eating volume and eating speed [34].
Furthermore, histamine neuron activation accelerates
lipolysis, particularly in visceral adipocyte, and increases
uncoupling protein (UCP) gene expression in mice [35].
Secondly,
the increased mastication necessary for fiber-
rich foods increases saliva and gastric acid production,
which increases gastric distention. Additionally, fiber-rich
foods generally contain a large volume of water, which
also increases gastric distention. Activation of stretch
receptors
in the stomach through gastric distension
contributes to satiety and satiation [36,37]. However,
tolerance development
to gastric distension has been
reported [37].

Food ingestion causes gastrointestinal responses. Gas-
trointestinal satiety peptides such as cholecystokinin,
glucagon-like peptide 1 and peptide YY have been shown
to reduce food intake not only in animals but also in man
[38]. Cholecystokinin has been the most extensively studied
gastrointestinal satiety peptide. Cholecystokinin is secreted
from cells in the small intestine upon ingestion of food and
plays a role in the stimulation of pancreatic secretion,
regulation of gastric emptying and central inducement of
satiety [39]. Evidence points to an important
role of
cholecystokinin within the brain to regulate hunger and
satiety [38]. The presence of nutrients in the lumen of the
duodenum causes the release of cholecystokinin. It has been
shown that fiber enrichment of a meal augmented the release
of cholecystokinin in women [40]. Most
the
increase in cholecystokinin concentrations was associated
with greater feelings of satiety in comparison to the low-
fiber-diet control group.

important,

The consumption of legumes, either alone or as part of a
mixed dish,
is characteristic of the Mediterranean diet.
Bourdon et al. [41] analyzed the gastrointestinal response
to ingestion of a high-fiber test meal, with beans as the
source of dietary fiber
(11.8 g fiber content). The
cholecystokinin response to the bean-rich meal was twice
as high as compared with the response to the low-fiber
control meal. This may partly be due to the delayed gastric
emptying, which prolonged the period of cholecystokinin
response. Furthermore,
trypsin
inhibitor, a common component of most legumes, stim-
ulates the secretion of cholecystokinin [42,43]. These
additional effects may be responsible for the significant
increase of cholecystokinin release after consuming the
test meal.

it has been shown that

Although the consumption of nut as an energy-dense
food has not been associated with weight gain in epidemi-
ological studies [44], most experimental nut feeding studies
reported no association of weight gain with nut consumption
despite an increase in energy intake [45]. One proposed
is the energy
mechanism that might explain this fact
expenditure of unsaturated fat. Furthermore,
the high
content of dietary fiber and proteins of nuts explains their
high satiety rating.

3.1.2. Dietary fat

is oxidation or storage. Hence,

High intake of olive oil is considered a hallmark of the
traditional Mediterranean diet. In the olive-growing areas of
the Mediterranean regions, olive oil is omnipresent in the
diet. It is used for cooking and is added to legumes, salads
and vegetable dishes. An increasing body of evidence
indicates the health benefits of olive oil consumption [46].
However, besides its generally healthy effects, concerns
regarding the potentially adverse effects of olive oil
consumption,
including weight gain, have been raised.
Indeed, vegetable oils, such as olive oil, are the most
energy-dense foods. However, epidemiological evidence
shows that olive oil consumption was not associated with
increased weight gain after 2 years of follow-up in a Spanish
cohort [21]. Furthermore, replacing dietary saturated fat
with predominantly monounsaturated fat resulted in signif-
icant
total weight and fat mass loss after 4 weeks of
treatment in overweight or obese men [47]. The metabolic
fate of dietary fat
the
capacity to oxidize fat is important for energy balance. The
degree of fat oxidation varies according to the type of fat.
Human studies have shown that polyunsaturated fatty acids
are better oxidized than saturated fatty acids [48]. Rodriguez
et al. [49] have shown that administration of olive oil up-
regulates UCP genes in adipose tissue and muscle of rats.
Recent data from a double-masked intervention trial
revealed that increases in dietary palmitic acid decreased
fat oxidation and daily energy expenditure, whereas oleic
acid had the opposite effect [50]. Furthermore, administra-
tion of olive oil promoted postprandial fat oxidation and
diet-induced thermogenesis in abdominally obese women
[51]. This may provide a physiological explanation of why
olive oil consumption is less prone to promote weight gain.
Moreover, one must take into account the context of olive
oil consumption in the Mediterranean diet. High consump-
tion of olive oil is closely related to the consumption of
vegetables and legumes. Adding olive oil
to salads or
cooked vegetables and legumes increases not only the
energy content of these dishes but also their palatability. The
energy content of a typical Mediterranean raw salad
consisting of tomato and lettuce (200 g tomato and 40 g
lettuce) increases from 40 to 150 kcal through the addition
of one tablespoon of olive oil. However, the total energy
content of this dish can be considered low when compared
with the energy content of one doughnut (100 kcal).

3.1.3. Energy density

The energy density of

foods, defined in terms of
available dietary energy per weight (energy content/weight
of food or kJ/g), is a key determinant of energy intake.
Several intervention studies have shown that energy density
influences short-term energy intake [52–54]. Energy density
of the total diet differs considerably among populations
[55]. The average energy density of the diet of the free-
living population of the Mediterranean basin is remarkably
lower (5.23 kJ/g for men; 4.63 kJ/g for women) than that

152

H. Schro¨der / Journal of Nutritional Biochemistry 18 (2007) 149–160

reported for the United States (7.98 kJ/g for men; 7.48 kJ/g
for women) [23,56].

Strict adherence to the Mediterranean diet has also been
associated with high fiber intake, high diet volume (water
content) and low energy density. A first course composed of
cooked vegetables,
legumes or fresh raw salads has a
relatively high content of dietary fiber and is low in energy
density. Furthermore, because it contains a considerable
amount of water, it possesses a high volume. Evidence
indicates that short-term food intake is affected more by the
weight or volume of food that is consumed than by the
energy content of the food [53,57,58].

In a recently published study, Rolls et al. [59] investi-
gated the effects of first-course salads on satiety and total
meal energy intake. The first-course salads differed in
portion size and energy density. Subjects were required to
consume the entire first course but ate as much pasta as they
wanted in a second dish. They found that the salad volume
(portion size) was the major determinant of ratings of
fullness and hunger and, consequently, of the intake of
the subsequent dish (pasta). Furthermore, the energy density
of the first course did not affect the consumption of pasta,
but it was the main factor that determined total energy
intake. Eating a high volume of a low energy-dense salad as
a first course reduced total energy intake by 12% in
comparison with having no first course. These results might
be partially explained by the physiological mechanisms
described above.

3.1.4. Alcohol consumption

The relationship between alcohol consumption and
weight changes is very complex [60]. Therefore, it is not
surprising that evidence from epidemiological and interven-
tion studies is inconclusive [60]. Moderate alcohol consump-
tion, particularly of red wine, is one of the characteristics of
the traditional Mediterranean diet. Vadstrup et al. [61]
observed that moderate wine consumption was not associated
with higher waist circumferences after 10 years in men and
women. Furthermore, recent data showed that voluntary red
wine consumption prevented weight gain in rats fed a high-
fat diet. This effect was mediated through a decrease in
energy intake [62]. The question of whether a specific
component of red wine affects mechanisms of satiety has not
yet been answered.

4. Mechanisms inversely linking the Mediterranean diet
to type 2 diabetes

4.1. Preventing obesity

The development of type 2 diabetes seems to be a product
the interaction between genetic susceptibility and
of
environmental factors [63,64]. In genetically susceptible
persons, excessive body weight commonly accompanies the
development of type 2 diabetes. Indeed, several
large
epidemiological studies have shown that excessive body

weight, particularly abdominal fat deposition, is an impor-
tant risk factor for type 2 diabetes [65–67]. Recently, Wang
et al. [68] showed that high waist circumference (an indirect
measure for abdominal fat deposition) is a better predictor of
type 2 diabetes than BMI (an indirect measure for general
obesity). Results of the Health Professionals Follow-Up
Study showed that a 1-kg increase in body weight was
associated with a 7.3% increase in the risk of type 2 diabetes
[67]. Excessive fat and carbohydrate intake increases energy
consumption and postprandial oxidative stress. The increase
in energy consumption may lead to an increase in abdominal
body fat accumulation. This type of body fat, in turn, is
linked to the progression of insulin resistance, which is, apart
from h cell dysfunction, one of the two fundamental abnor-
malities involved in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes. Up
to now, there has been no definite proof in humans of a
causal link between abdominal obesity and insulin resis-
tance. However, several plausible mechanisms could explain
such a link. The adipose tissue is now recognized to be a
highly active metabolic and endocrine organ [69]. Quanti-
tatively, the most important secretion is fatty acids. The
increased release of nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA) inhibits
insulin-stimulated glucose metabolism in skeletal muscle
and stimulates gluconeogenesis in the liver. Furthermore, the
adipose tissue secretes a large number of proteins called
adipokines [70]. Several of these adipokines adversely affect
the insulin-signaling cascade. Tumor necrosis factor a
(TNFa) enhances adipocyte lipolysis, with a subsequent
increase of NEFA. Furthermore, TNFa exerts direct adverse
effects on insulin-signaling pathways [71,72].

is of particular

In contrast to the elevated levels of NEFA and TNFa in
abdominal obesity, concentrations of adiponectin, an adi-
pose-specific protein, are decreased in obese subjects [73].
This fact
importance because there is
evidence that adiponectin improves insulin sensitivity and
exerts anti-inflammatory protective effects [73]. Recently,
Yang et al. showed that
the expression of GLUT4, the
transmenbrane transporter of glucose, is down-regulated by
retinol binding protein-4 (RBP4) [74]. Furthermore, serum
levels or RBP4 is elevated in humans with obesity and type
2 diabetes, and RBP4 mRNA was selectively increased in
adipose tissue [74]. Excessive energy consumption, includ-
ing high intakes of
increases
postprandial glycemia and lipidemia. Recent data have
suggested that beta cell dysfunction is a result of prolonged
exposure to elevated glucose and NEFA. Postprandial
hyperglycemia induces oxidative stress [75], which, in turn,
damages the beta cells, which are sensitive to reactive
oxygen species (ROS) [76,77].

fat and carbohydrates,

The mechanistic links between obesity, particularly
abdominal obesity, and insulin resistance suggest a causal
relationship of weight gain and pathogenesis of type 2
diabetes. Diets preventing weight gain, such as the Medi-
terranean diet, exert a protective effect on the development
of type 2 diabetes, which is partially mediated through
weight maintenance.

4.2. Antioxidant-rich foods

role in the development of

Results from epidemiological studies indicate that a high
consumption of fruits and vegetables, either alone or as
components of a healthy dietary pattern, reduced the risk of
type 2 diabetes [16,17,78–82]. Adherence to the Mediter-
ranean diet
is associated with a high consumption of
antioxidant-rich foods such as vegetables and fruits [23].
Furthermore, in a Greek cohort, a high antioxidant capacity
was found among those who closely adhered to the
Mediterranean diet [83]. Recently, Sanchez-Moreno et al.
[84] reported that the consumption of gazpacho, a typical
Mediterranean dish, reduced F2-isoprostanes, a marker of
oxidative stress, and increased plasma vitamin C in healthy
subjects. These data indicate that the Mediterranean diet
protects individuals from oxidative stress, defined as the
persistent
imbalance between the production of highly
reactive molecular species (ROS and/or reactive nitrogen
species) and antioxidant defense. This fact is of special
interest because prolonged increased oxidative stress seems
to play a crucial
insulin
resistance and beta cell dysfunction [85,86]. Excessive
caloric intake leads to a substrate-induced increase in citric
acid cycle activity, which, in turn, generates an excess of
mitochondrial NADH and ROS [87–89]. The prevention of
the entry of energetic substrates into the mitochondria could
be a self-defense mechanism of the cell, which prevents an
increase in the formation of mitochondrial NADH. In fact, if
the excess NADH is not dissipated,
then free radical
production increases, resulting particularly to the formation
of superoxide anions [88,89]. Insulin resistance might be
considered as a compensatory state that protects the cell
against further insulin-stimulated glucose and FFA uptake
and subsequent oxidative damage. Indeed, there is evidence
supporting this hypothesis. In cell culture models, induction
of oxidative stress inhibits insulin-stimulated glucose uptake
[90,91], and in results of animal studies, antioxidants
improved insulin sensitivity. Furthermore, clinical
trials
have demonstrated that administration of vitamin antiox-
idants improved insulin sensitivity [92,93]. Results from
cross-sectional studies showed that dietary intake of
carotenoids and plasma carotenoid concentrations were
inversely associated with fasting plasma glucose and insulin
resistance [94–97]. Furthermore, low plasma concentrations
of vitamin E were found to increase the risk of type 2
diabetes in a prospective cohort [98]. Recently published
data from a randomized intervention trial showed that
following a Mediterranean-style diet rich in antioxidant-
containing foods significantly decreases insulin resistance in
patients with the metabolic syndrome, as compared with the
normal diet control group [25]. In this sense, it is important
to note that the short-term administration of virgin olive oil
decreases several markers of oxidative stress [99]. These
data from cellular culture models, animal studies, clinical
intervention trials and epidemiological studies strongly
suggest the central role that oxidative stress plays in the

pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes, as well as the role that
dietary antioxidants play in protecting individuals from
this disease.

4.3. Polyphenol-rich foods

Polyphenolic compounds are widely found in character-
istic foods of
the Mediterranean diet, such as fruits,
vegetables, cereals, legumes and wine [100]. The two main
types of polyphenols are flavonoids and phenolic acids
[101]. Flavonoids exert a wide range of biological effects,
such as the modulation of enzymatic activity, inhibition of
cellular proliferation or antioxidant and anti-inflammatory
properties [102,103]. Epidemiological evidence suggests a
protective effect of fruits and vegetables, rich sources of
polyphenolic compounds, on the development of type 2
diabetes [17,80,81,104]. Recently, however, Song et al. did
not find a reduced risk of several flavonoids and type 2
diabetes in a large cohort of women after 8.8 years of
follow-up [105]. Results of animal studies indicate a
glycemia-lowering effect of polyphenols. This effect seems
to be mediated through the inhibition of alpha-glucosidase
in the gut mucosa [106]. Administration of quercetin
inhibited glucose absorption in rats [109]. Furthermore, in
a cell culture model, quercetin inhibited glucose transport by
GLUT2 [107]. Evidence from culture cell studies suggests
that polyphenols may increase glucose uptake by peripheral
tissues [108,109]. However, due to the fact
the
administered dosage of polyphenols in the abovementioned
studies was superior to that found normally, it is unknown
whether these results could be reproduced in humans.

that

4.4. Magnesium-rich foods

Magnesium is an essential cofactor of high-energy
phosphate-bound enzymatic pathways [110]. Insufficient
magnesium intake leading to hypomagnesemia has been
associated with several disorders including type 2 diabetes
[111,112]. Various characteristic components of the Medi-
terranean diet, such as vegetables, legumes and nuts, are rich
sources of magnesium;
therefore, high adherence to the
Mediterranean diet is associated with a high consumption of
magnesium. Evidence from epidemiological studies shows a
reduced risk of type 2 diabetes with high intakes of
magnesium [111,113–115]. These data indicate an important
role of magnesium status in the pathogenesis of type 2
diabetes. However, the underlying molecular mechanism(s)
by which magnesium intake influences insulin resistance is
poorly understood. It has been hypothesized that maintain-
ing intracellular magnesium homeostasis is crucial
for
adequate cellular responsiveness to insulin [116]. Magne-
sium is part of the activated MgATP complex that
is
required for all ATP- and phosphate-transfer-associated
enzymes. Reduced intracellular magnesium concentrations
lead to a decrease in the activity of these enzymes, which, in
turn, might favor insulin resistance. It has been shown that
insulin resistance in magnesium-deficient rats might be
partially attributed to a decrease of tyrosine kinase activity

154

the extracellular

insulin receptors [117]. At

of
level,
magnesium moderates intracellular calcium uptake through
its nonspecific antagonistic effects on calcium channels
[118,119]. This fact is of importance because an increased
intracellular concentration of calcium impaired insulin
signaling through the reduced ability of insulin to activate
phosphoserine phosphatase 1 [120].

4.5. Moderate alcohol consumption

Recently published data of meta-analysis of epidemio-
logical studies suggest a protective effect of moderate
alcohol consumption on the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes
[121–123]. In comparison with nonalcohol consumers,
moderate alcohol drinking was associated with a 30% risk

reduction of type 2 diabetes in both genders [121,122]. This
risk reduction was not seen for elevated alcohol consump-
tion [121–123]. Taking into account that estimating alcohol
consumption in epidemiological studies is complex and
problematic, results should be interpreted with caution.
However, from a mechanistic point of view, the protective
effect of moderate alcohol consumption on type 2 diabetes
can be explained through the enhancing effect of moderate
alcohol drinking on insulin sensitivity observed in epide-
miological studies [124–126]. Sierksma et al. [127] reported
an increase in insulin sensitivity accompanied by an
increase in plasma adiponectin levels, but without changes
in plasma TNFa, in healthy men after moderate alcohol
consumption (40 g/day) for 17 days.

Fig. 2. Proposed mechanisms that link the Mediterranean diet with the prevention of type 2 diabetes.

One might question whether plasma concentration of
TNFa represents activity at the tissue level. Furthermore,
there are other mechanistic explanations for the protective
effects of adiponectin on insulin resistance. Animal studies
have suggested that adiponectin reduces NEFA [128,129].
Recent
research has demonstrated that adiponectin
decreases the hepatic fat content in mice with fatty liver
disease. This effect was partially mediated through an
increase in hepatic fatty acid oxidation and a decrease in
hepatic fatty acid synthesis [130]. Furthermore, Yamauchi et
al.
[131] showed that adiponectin stimulates glucose
utilization and fatty acid oxidation through activation of
the 5V-AMP-activated protein kinase. Recently published
data on an intervention study showed that
the daily
administration of 360 ml of
red wine for 14 days
significantly increased insulin sensitivity in type 2 diabetic
patients [132]. It is of interest to note that this effect was not
mediated by or linked to endothelial dysfunction as reported
by other authors [133,134].

Despite all

the evidence for the existence of a link
between moderate alcohol consumption and increased
plasma levels of adiponectin, the mechanisms at work have
not been established.

4.6. Carbohydrate and dietary fiber

A high consumption of cereals and their products is one
characteristic of the traditional Mediterranean diet. To date,
there are no published data on the type of cereals (refined or
whole) consumed during the late 1950s in Mediterranean
regions. It seems very likely that the consumption of whole
grains during this time was notably higher than today.

However, in the absence of published data, no definitive
conclusion concerning this issue can be drawn. An
increasing consumption of carbohydrates can be expected
with increasing adherence to this dietary pattern [23]. In
epidemiological studies, an intake of total carbohydrates did
not predict the risk of type 2 diabetes [135]. Carbohydrate-
rich foods can be characterized, apart from their fiber
content, on the basis of
their effects on postprandial
glycemia. This effect can be expressed as glycemic index
(GI) [136]. Postprandial blood glucose response can also be
influenced by the amount of carbohydrates ingested. The
glycemic load (GL) of a food, a concept developed in
epidemiological studies to better represent the quality and
quantity of carbohydrates consumed,
is defined as the
amount of carbohydrate contained in an average portion of a
food multiplied by the GI value of the food [136]. Data from
observational studies showed inconsistent results between
risk of type 2 diabetes and GI or GL [137–141]. Indeed,
there is controversy concerning the usefulness of
the
concepts of GI and GL in the prevention of type 2 diabetes
[142–144]. Recently, Alfenas and Mattes [145] reported no
significant difference in the response of plasma glucose and
insulin to the consumption of low- and high-GI meals.
Furthermore, data from the Inter99 study, an intervention
study with the aim of reducing cardiovascular diseases
through healthy choices in diet, physical activity and
smoking, showed no association of habitual intake of diets
that are low and high in both GI and GL with the risk of
having insulin resistance. In contrast, dietary fiber was
inversely associated with this risk [146]. Insulin resistance,
which is not synonymous with type 2 diabetes mellitus, is a

156

key step in the pathogenesis of this disease. There is
consistent epidemiological evidence to support a protective
effect of dietary fiber, in particular cereal fiber, on insulin
sensitivity and the risk of type 2 diabetes [137–139,146,147].
Several mechanisms may link dietary fiber with the risk of
type 2 diabetes. The insulin-sensitizing effects of dietary
cereal fiber may be mediated through magnesium, a nutrient
found in the outer husk of whole grains (see Section 4.4).
Furthermore, the beneficial effect of dietary fiber on glucose
metabolism may be the result of a delayed gastric emptying
rate and slowed digestion and absorption, which, in turn,
slows the rate of glucose absorption and reduces plasma
insulin levels [148,149]. An additional mechanistic hypoth-
esis for dietary fiber’s capability to protect individuals from
type 2 diabetes, as discussed in Section 3.1, is that it helps
maintain an appropriate and stable weight. This in turn exerts
favorable effects on insulin sensitivity.

4.7. Foods rich in unsaturated fat

Early epidemiological evidence suggested a deleterious
effect of total fat consumption on the development of
diabetes [150]. More recent large cohort studies that take
into account the fat type consumed have shown an increased
risk of the development of type 2 diabetes with high intakes
of saturated fat. In contrast, an inverse association was
reported for unsaturated fat [151–153]. Although total fat
intake did not seem to directly increase the risk of type 2
diabetes, an indirect
intake that
promotes weight gain should be considered [153,154]. A
high intake of monounsaturated fatty acids, predominantly
from olive oil,
is a key characteristic of the traditional
Mediterranean diet. There is some evidence that oleic acid,
the predominant fatty acid of olive oil, is associated with
lower insulin resistance [155,156]. However, contradictory
results have also been reported [157,158].

influence of high fat

Furthermore,

the mechanisms linking the type of
dietary fat with insulin resistance are not completely
understood. Cell membrane lipid composition is influ-
enced by fatty acid composition of dietary fat. The
specific fatty acid profile in cell membranes might affect
insulin action in a number of ways, such as insulin
receptor binding and the ability to influence ion perme-
ability and cell signaling.

4.8. Conclusion

fruits,

Several mechanistic links (Figs. 1 and 2) offer potential
explanations of the Mediterranean diet’s protective effect on
obesity and type 2 diabetes. High consumption of vegeta-
bles,
legumes, nuts, fish, cereals and olive oil,
together with moderate consumption of alcohol, predomi-
nantly wine,
leads to high ingestion of dietary fiber,
antioxidants, magnesium and unsaturated fatty acids.
Additionally, this diet is characterized by a low degree of
energy density overall, which might be particularly impor-
tant for the prevention of weight gain. Intervention studies
on energy density and appetite control tend to be conducted

under short-term laboratory conditions. A number of
researchers have suggested potential mechanisms by which
isolated components of the Mediterranean diet can prevent
weight gain, insulin resistance and beta cell dysfunction
(i.e., some nutrients such as dietary fiber, calcium and
magnesium influence metabolic pathways or signaling
mechanisms). However, a bbig pictureQ approach to food
intake and its effect on the development or prevention of
obesity and diabetes may be more predictive of disease risk.
It is important for individuals to understand the protective
effects of healthy foods, particularly on obesity and type 2
diabetes, within the context of a healthy overall diet.
