OBJECTIVEdThe evidence on the association between ﬁsh consumption, dietary long-chain
n-3 fatty acids, and risk of type 2 diabetes is inconsistent. We therefore performed a systematic
review and meta-analysis of the available prospective evidence.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODSdStudies were identiﬁed by searching the
PubMed and EMBASE databases through 15 December 2011 and by reviewing the reference
lists of retrieved articles. Prospective studies were included if they reported relative risk (RR)
estimates with 95% CIs for the association between ﬁsh consumption and/or dietary long-chain
n-3 fatty acids and incidence of type 2 diabetes. A dose-response random-effects model was used
to combine study-speciﬁc RRs. Potential sources of heterogeneity were explored by prespeciﬁed
stratiﬁcations.

RESULTSdSixteen studies involving 527,441 participants and 24,082 diabetes cases were
included. Considerable statistical heterogeneity in the overall summary estimates was partly
explained by geographical differences. For each serving per week increment in ﬁsh consumption,
the RRs (95% CIs) of type 2 diabetes were 1.05 (1.02–1.09), 1.03 (0.96–1.11), and 0.98 (0.97–
1.00) combining U.S., European, and Asian/Australian studies, respectively. For each 0.30 g per
day increment in long-chain n-3 fatty acids, the corresponding summary estimates were 1.17
(1.09–1.26), 0.98 (0.70–1.37), and 0.90 (0.82–0.98).

CONCLUSIONSdResults from this meta-analysis indicate differences between geographical
regions in observed associations of ﬁsh consumption and dietary intake of long-chain n-3 fatty
acids with risk of type 2 diabetes. In consideration of the heterogeneous results, the relationship
warrants further investigation. Meanwhile, current public health recommendations on ﬁsh con-
sumption should be upheld unchanged.

T ype 2 diabetes is one of the most

common chronic diseases with a
great public health burden in most
countries. The worldwide prevalence has
been estimated to be about 285 million
and is predicted to increase substantially
in the coming decades (1). Lifestyle fac-
tors, including diet, are key components
in the primary prevention of type 2

diabetes (2). Fish consumption has been
of particular interest given the beneﬁcial
effects seen on multiple risk factors asso-
ciated with diabetes, such as lipid proﬁle,
blood pressure, and inﬂammation, as well
as on coronary heart disease and stroke
(3). The observed cardiovascular beneﬁts
of ﬁsh consumption have largely been at-
tributed to the long-chain n-3 fatty acids

eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosa-
hexaenoic acid (DHA), predominantly
found in fatty ﬁsh (3). Composition of di-
etary fatty acids is of interest in diabetes
because fatty acids may inﬂuence glucose
metabolism by altering cell membrane
function, enzyme activity, insulin signaling,
and gene expression (4), and long-chain
n-3 fatty acids are known to be especially
potent (5). However, the role of ﬁsh con-
sumption and long-chain n-3 fatty acids
in the development of type 2 diabetes re-
mains unclear. Results from randomized
controlled trials evaluating the effects of
long-chain n-3 fatty acid supplementa-
tion on insulin and glucose metabolism
among nondiabetic individuals have been
mixed. Most studies, including a recent
meta-analysis, have however reported
no effect (6). The epidemiological evi-
dence on ﬁsh and long-chain n-3 fatty
acids in relation to diabetes incidence
has recently emerged, but the results
have been inconsistent.

Our aim was to summarize the results
from prospective studies on the association
between self-reported total ﬁsh consump-
tion and dietary intake of long-chain n-3
fatty acids and incident type 2 diabetes
with a systematic review and a dose-
response meta-analysis, adhering to the
PRISMA statement (7).

RESEARCH DESIGN AND
METHODS

Literature search and data
extraction
We conducted a literature search through
15 December 2011 using the PubMed and
EMBASE databases without restrictions on
language or publication date. The search
term “diabetes” was used in combination
with “ﬁsh,” “seafood,” “fatty acids,” “long-
chain omega-3,” “long-chain n-3,” “docosa-
hexaenoic acid,” or “eicosapentaenoic acid”
and “cohort,” “prospective,” “follow-up,” or
“longitudinal.” Moreover, we reviewed the
reference lists from retrieved articles to
identify additional relevant studies. Studies
were included in the meta-analysis if the

following criteria were met and reported: 1)
prospective design (prospective cohort
studies or nested case-control studies); 2)
the exposure studied was self-reported ﬁsh
consumption or dietary intake of long-
chain n-3 fatty acids (marine derived n-3
fatty acids such as EPA and DHA); 3) the
outcome of interest was incidence of type 2
diabetes; and 4) relative risk (RR) estimates
with 95% CIs. We considered odds ratios,
risk ratios, and hazard ratios as estimates of
the RR. Dose-response meta-analysis re-
quires the distribution of cases and noncases
or person-time, and RRs with 95% CIs for
at least three quantitative exposure catego-
ries or for a continuous exposure. For all
identiﬁed studies that met inclusion criteria
but failed to report sufﬁcient information
(8–13), we obtained additional information
from the authors. If data were duplicated in
more than one study, we included the study
with the largest number of cases.

The following data were extracted from
each study: the ﬁrst author’s last name,
publication year, country where the study
was performed, study period, number of
cases and cohort size, sex and age of study
participants, measure and range of expo-
sure, methods for identifying type 2 diabe-
tes, variables adjusted for in the analysis,
and RR estimates with corresponding
95% CIs for each category of consumption
of ﬁsh and/or long-chain n-3 fatty acids.
When several risk estimates were presen-
ted, we extracted the ones that reﬂected the
greatest degree of control for potential con-
founders. The study quality was assessed
using the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality As-
sessment Scale for cohort studies, with
which each study is judged based on the
selection of study groups, the comparabil-
ity of the groups, the exposure assessment,
and ascertainment of outcome (14). Study
selection, data extraction, and quality as-
sessment were conducted independently
by two authors (A.Wa. and D.D.G.), with
disagreements resolved by consensus.

Meta-analysis
We conducted a two-stage dose-response
random-effects meta-analysis to combine
study-speciﬁc RRs (15). Linear dose-
response curves were estimated taking
the covariance among risk estimates for
different exposure categories into account
(15). Because the included studies used
different units to report ﬁsh consumption
(i.e., grams or servings), we rescaled con-
sumption into servings per week using
100 g as the approximate average serving
size. In addition, we explored how this
assumption affected the results by

changing the approximated serving
size to 80 g and 140 g. The median level
of consumption for each category was
assigned to the corresponding RR esti-
mate. When the median consumption
per category was not presented in the
article, the midpoint between the up-
per and lower boundary was used. If the
lowest category was open-ended, the lower
boundary was assumed to be zero. Open-
ended top categories were assumed to be of
the same magnitude as the preceding cate-
gory. We assessed a potential departure
from linearity in the dose-response relation-
ship by modeling consumption levels using
restricted cubic splines with three knots at
ﬁxed percentiles 10, 50, and 90% of the
distribution. A P value for nonlinearity
was calculated by testing the null hypothe-
sis that the coefﬁcient of the second spline is
equal to 0 in a multivariable random-ef-
fects meta-regression model (16). To ex-
amine potential sources of heterogeneity,
prespeciﬁed sensitivity analyses were de-
ﬁned, including stratiﬁcations by sex, geo-
graphical region, methods for exposure
assessment and ascertainment of out-
come, and quality score. Data were not
available in the published articles to exam-
ine other potentially inﬂuential factors,
such as age and BMI categories. Further,
we conducted sensitivity analyses omit-
ting one study at the time to evaluate
whether results were affected markedly by
single studies. We also examined the effect
of omitting studies with nested case-con-
trol design. Statistical heterogeneity among
studies was evaluated with the Cochran Q-
test and the I2 statistic (17), which assesses
the proportion of total variation that is due
to between-study variation. Potential pub-
lication bias was assessed with the Egger
regression asymmetry test (18). All statisti-
cal analyses were performed with Stata soft-
ware, version 10.1 (Stata Corp, College
Station, Texas, USA). P , 0.05 was consid-
ered statistically signiﬁcant.

RESULTS

Systematic review and study
characteristics
The detailed steps of our literature search
are shown in Fig. 1. Brieﬂy, a total of
2,473 articles were identiﬁed by search-
ing the databases, 434 duplicated articles
and 2,019 articles that did not meet the
selection criteria were excluded after
screening of abstract and/or title. The re-
maining 20 articles and 1 additional article
(12) identiﬁed from reference lists were
obtained for full-text review. Among

these, 5 articles were excluded because
they assessed only total polyunsaturated
fatty acids and/or outcome was deﬁned
as impaired glucose tolerance rather than
incidence of type 2 diabetes (19–23). In
addition, two duplicate reports from the
same study population were excluded
(24,25). The remaining 14 publications,
reporting results from 16 separate cohort
studies, were included in the meta-analysis
(8–13,26–33).

Characteristics of the included studies
are presented in Table 1. The 14 articles
were published between 2001 and 2011
and involved a total of 527,441 participants
and 24,082 cases of diabetes. Two articles
reported results from 2 (11) or 3 (28) in-
dependent cohorts. Three studies that also
assessed biomarkers of fatty acid composi-
tion, available only in subsets of the study
populations, used a nested case-control
design within cohorts with prospective col-
lection of dietary data to study the associa-
tion between intake of long-chain n-3 fatty
acids and risk of type 2 diabetes (8,9,31).
Among them, one reported on the associa-
tion with ﬁsh consumption in the whole
cohort in a separate article (10). Among
the 16 cohorts, 10 assessed both ﬁsh
consumption and intake of long-chain
n-3 fatty acids (9–11,13,28–30,32), where-
as 3 reported only on the fatty acids
(8,26,31) and 3 only on ﬁsh consumption
(12,27,33). Seven studies were conducted
in the U.S. (26–28,30,32), 4 in Europe
(9,10,12,29,31), 4 in Asia (11,13,33),
and 1 in Australia (8). All studies reported
RRs adjusted for age and sex; all but 2
were further adjusted for total energy in-
take (8,27), smoking (8,27) and BMI
(27,29); and all but 3 were adjusted for
physical activity (12,27,29) and alcohol
intake (12,26,27). Other covariates were
less consistently included in the
multivariate models. Eleven studies
used self-administered food frequency
questionnaires (FFQ) to collect dietary
data (8–10,26–28,30–33), whereas 5
used interviewer-administered FFQs
(11–13,29). In 1 study, total ﬁsh con-
sumption was assessed by a single ques-
tion (27), whereas it was obtained as the
sum of different types of ﬁsh in other
studies. Long-chain n-3 fatty acids was
deﬁned as the sum of EPA and DHA in
11 studies (8,9,11,13,28,29,31,32), as
the sum of EPA, DHA, and docosapen-
tenoic acid in 1 study (30), and not fur-
ther explained in 1 study (26). Six
studies updated the dietary information
with additional FFQs after baseline
(11,28,32). Incident diabetes cases were

identiﬁed by self-report in 13 studies, of
which 7 followed up the information
with supplementary questionnaires or
interviews (28,30), with physician’s
conﬁrmation (8,31), or with linkage to
medical registries (9,10). One study used
information from general practitioners and
pharmacy databases to identify incident
cases (29), 1 used medication inventory
information together with measurements
of fasting glucose (32), and 1 used linkage
to a nationwide register of drug reimburse-
ment (12). Among studies that included all
self-reported cases (11,13,26,27,33),
2 stated that validity of self-reports was
reasonable (13,33) and 1 that results did
not differ substantially when using a more
strict case deﬁnition (11). The mean range
of intake between the highest and the low-
est category across studies was about 5.0
servings per week for ﬁsh and about 0.38 g
per day for long-chain n-3 fatty acids. The
study quality was generally good, with all
but 3 studies (8,27,30) reaching criteria
for $6 stars on the scale of 9 (14).

Combined results
The results across all studies were mixed,
with positive, inverse, or null associations.
For total ﬁsh consumption, there was a
high degree of heterogeneity between the
13 included studies (I2 = 81.3%; P ,
0.001). For dietary intake of long-chain

n-3 fatty acids, substantial heterogeneity
was also observed between the 13 included
studies (I2 = 78.3%; P , 0.001). Omitting
1 study at a time showed that neither
summary risk estimates nor measures of
statistical heterogeneity were markedly
inﬂuenced by single studies (I2 range,
ﬁsh: 70.2–82.8%; long-chain n-3 fatty
acids: 73.2–80.1%; P , 0.001). Further,
results of the analysis on ﬁsh consumption
were not substantially affected by changing
the approximated average serving size from
100 g to 80 g (I2 = 82.5%; P , 0.001) or
140 g (I2 = 78.9%; P , 0.001). Excluding
the 3 nested case-control studies on long-
chain n-3 fatty acid intake (8,9,31) also had
little inﬂuence (I2 = 79.7%; P , 0.001).

Because of the high degree of heteroge-
neity, we did not combine results across all
studies into an overall summary risk es-
timate. Results of the sensitivity analyses
conducted to investigate potential sources
of heterogeneity are shown in Table 2, in-
cluding stratiﬁcations by sex, geographical
region, and FFQ type, and exclusion of
studies with a quality score ,6 (8,27,30)
and studies that ascertained type 2 diabetes
through self-report only (11,13,26,27,33).
There were substantial differences according
to geographical region, in part explaining
the heterogeneity in the overall estimates.

The estimated RRs of type 2 diabetes
associated with ﬁsh consumption and

intake of long-chain n-3 fatty acids are
shown in Fig. 2A and B for individual studies
and combined by geographical region. For
each serving per week increment in total ﬁsh
consumption, the summary RRs of type 2
diabetes were 1.05 (95% CI 1.02–1.09),
1.03 (0.96–1.11), and 0.98 (0.97–1.00)
combining studies from the U.S., Europe,
and Asia/Australia, respectively. For each
0.30 g per day increment in dietary long-
chain n-3 fatty acid intake (corresponding
to approximately one serving per week of
fatty ﬁsh), the corresponding summary
RRs were 1.17 (1.09–1.26), 0.98 (0.70–
1.37), and 0.90 (0.82–0.98). Excluding
one Australian nested case-control study
on long-chain n-3 fatty acid intake (8) did
not markedly affect the summary esti-
mate of Asian/Australian studies (0.90
[0.81–1.00]), whereas all six of the U.S.
studies were of cohort design, and only a
single European cohort study remained
after exclusion of two nested case-control
studies (9,31) in this subgroup.

The Egger test showed no evidence
of publication bias for total ﬁsh consump-
tion (P = 0.85) or dietary intake of long-
chain n-3 fatty acids (P = 0.10). We ﬂexibly
modeled the dose-response relationships
using restricted cubic splines, and we
found no evidence of departure from the
simpler linear trends (Pnonlinearity = 0.81 for
ﬁsh; Pnonlinearity = 0.76 for long-chain n-3
fatty acids).

CONCLUSIONSdWe report the ﬁrst
systematic review and meta-analysis of
the prospective association between total
ﬁsh consumption, dietary intake of long-
chain n-3 fatty acids, and risk of incident
type 2 diabetes. Results from this large
analysis including 24,082 cases of di-
abetes and 527,441 participants show
substantial heterogeneity across study
results, potentially explained by differ-
ences between geographical regions. The
summary risk estimates indicate no asso-
ciation among European studies, a direct
association among U.S. studies, and an in-
verse association among Asian/Australian
studies. However, results are also partly
inconsistent within study areas, and the
number of studies outside the U.S. is lim-
ited. Compared with major risk factors for
type 2 diabetes, such as overweight and
obesity (associated with RRs of 2.99 [95%
CI 2.42–3.72] and 7.19 [5.74–9.00] in a
recent meta-analysis [34]), the strength of
the summary risk estimates in the current
study is modest. A 5% increase in risk for
each weekly serving of ﬁsh in U.S. studies,
however, is comparable to risk estimates

Wallin and Associates

reported for other dietary factors in rela-
tion to type 2 diabetes, such as red meat
(1.19 [1.04–1.37] per 100 g per day) (35).
Strengths of this meta-analysis in-
clude its large size, and that the assess-
ment was based on data from prospective
studies only. This minimizes the possibil-
ity that the results were due to recall or
selection bias, which are of particular
concern in other epidemiological study
designs. Recall bias may be especially
problematic when studying associations
between dietary factors and type 2 di-
abetes, as diagnosed patients commonly
get speciﬁc dietary advice and thus may
change their habits. In addition, the use
of a dose-response approach is superior
to the conventional methodology of com-
paring only the extreme categories of in-
take, which can vary considerably
between studies conducted in different
populations. From a public health per-
spective, a dose-response meta-analysis
can provide more useful estimates for better
quantifying associations between speciﬁed
amounts of food and disease risk. However,
the approach requires a number of assump-
tions to be made. In terms of associations
between absolute intake levels and disease
risk, a meta-analysis can only be as good as
the individual study instruments that were
used. Dietary questionnaires such as the
FFQs are generally more valuable for rank-
ing study participants according to their
consumption than for measuring exact
consumption levels. In addition, combin-
ing results from different studies requires
comparing different instruments. Assump-
tions also had to be made regarding the
median level of consumption for each ca-
tegory when this information was missing
in the individual studies. Finally, since six
studies expressed ﬁsh consumption in
grams rather than in servings, we had to
make assumptions about average serving
size.

There are also potential limitations of
our ﬁndings that must be taken into
consideration when interpreting the re-
sults. First, a meta-analysis cannot solve in-
herent problems with confounding in the
included studies, which may bias the re-
sults toward exaggeration or underestima-
tion of risk estimates. Although most studies
controlled for total energy intake, smoking,
BMI, physical activity, and alcohol, other
factors were less consistently included in
the multivariate models. To evaluate the im-
pact of these differences on heterogeneity
between studies, we separately combined
age- and sex-adjusted (plus race and area
where applicable) RR estimates from the

7 studies on ﬁsh consumption providing
such data (10,27,28,32,33). The statistical
heterogeneity in the summary estimate re-
mained (I2 = 79.5%; P , 0.001), indicating
that differences in included covariates is not
an important explanation of the differences
between studies observed in this meta-
analysis. Second, most of the included stud-
ies assessed diet with a self-administered
FFQ, and in all but 6 studies (11,28,32)
dietary intake was based on a single ques-
tionnaire administered at baseline. There-
fore, our ﬁndings are likely to be affected
by some misclassiﬁcation of exposure. In
cohort studies, misclassiﬁcation is gener-
ally nondifferential, which most likely at-
tenuates the association. Our meta-analysis
included questionnaire data on fatty acid
intake, while objectively measured fatty
acids (e.g., in plasma phospholipid or
erythrocyte membrane fractions) would
reduce measurement error. Among the
13 studies included in the meta-analysis
of long-chain n-3 fatty acids, 4 used bio-
marker measurements in addition to in-
take derived from FFQs (8,9,31,32).
Neither EPA nor DHA in plasma phospho-
lipids (8,9,32) or erythrocyte membrane
phospholipids (9,31) were signiﬁcantly
associated with risk of type 2 diabetes in

individual studies. However, because of
the limited number of studies, we did
not pool the study-speciﬁc risk estimates.
Measurement error may potentially also
have affected the outcome variable (dia-
betes incidence) as the result of under-
reporting of diagnosis in asymptomatic
individuals. It is plausible that rates of
screening and surveillance may be higher
among participants with a healthier life-
style associated with higher ﬁsh consump-
tion, which could lead to greater case
ascertainment among such individuals.
Further, it is possible that people who
are diagnosed with one or several risk fac-
tors for diabetes increase their ﬁsh con-
sumption as part of a lifestyle change.
However, studies that additionally ad-
justed for hypertension and serum choles-
terol (12) restricted analyses to individuals
without hypercholesterolemia or hyper-
tension (28), tested for interaction with
hypertensive status (13), or excluded par-
ticipants who were diagnosed with
diabetes during the ﬁrst years of follow-
up (11,13,30,31) observed no substantial
differences in risk estimates. Finally, in a
meta-analysis of published studies, publi-
cation bias could be of concern because
studies with null results or small sample

sizes tend not to be published. However,
we found no evidence of publication bias in
this meta-analysis.

Intake of long-chain n-3 fatty acids
has been hypothesized to have beneﬁcial
effects on insulin resistance and type 2
diabetes because of their ability to inhibit
inﬂammatory pathways and suppress ex-
pression of genes related to lipid metab-
olism (5). However, most randomized
controlled trials that have examined the
effects of long-chain n-3 fatty acid supple-
mentation on insulin sensitivity have
found no effects (6). If an association be-
tween ﬁsh consumption and risk of type 2
diabetes is attributable to a high intake of
EPA and DHA, the association should be
more evident with fatty than with lean
ﬁsh. However, only three studies assessed
types of ﬁsh separately (10,29,33). The
Rotterdam study reported positive associ-
ations with total and lean ﬁsh (accounting
for 81% of total ﬁsh consumption), but
not with fatty ﬁsh or with long-chain
n-3 fatty acids (29). Results from the Euro-
pean Prospective Investigation of Cancer
(EPIC)-Norfolk cohort indicated inverse
associations with total, white and oily
ﬁsh, although statistically signiﬁcant only
for total ﬁsh (10). In a subsample of the

same cohort, the association with intake of
long-chain n-3 fatty acids was nonsigniﬁ-
cantly inverse (9). In the Japanese study,
risk of type 2 diabetes tended to decrease
with oily ﬁsh consumption, but not with
lean ﬁsh among men; no associations were
observed with either total or types of ﬁsh
among women (33). It should also be
noted that most studies did not distin-
guish between preparation methods. It is
possible that consumption of fried and
deep-fried ﬁsh, as well as the use of batter
and type of frying media may differ between
populations, potentially in part explain-
ing the differences between geographical
regions.

In addition to long-chain n-3 fatty
acids, ﬁsh is an important contributor to
selenium intake. Findings from random-
ized trials indicate that selenium supple-
mentation may be associated with an
increased risk of type 2 diabetes (36). In
one of the included studies on long-chain
n-3 fatty acids, additional adjustment for
selenium intake markedly attenuated the
risk estimates (29). Regarding vitamin D,
another nutrient abundant in ﬁsh, there is
accumulating evidence that inadequate
vitamin D status may be associated with
development of type 2 diabetes, but evi-
dence from longitudinal studies measur-
ing circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D is
sparse and inconsistent (37). There is
also the potential of adverse effects due
to ingestion of contaminated ﬁsh. The
available evidence of an association be-
tween exposure to persistent organic pol-
lutants and risk of type 2 diabetes is
relatively consistent (38). However, as it
is conceivable that the metabolism of the
pollutants could be altered as a conse-
quence of the disease, identiﬁcation of
mechanisms by which these compounds
could inﬂuence risk is needed to deter-
mine if the association reﬂects a causal
relationship (38). Further, ﬁsh consump-
tion is one of the major sources of mer-
cury exposure, which has been shown to
affect insulin secretion through oxidative
stress–induced b-cell dysfunction (39).
A recent large scale cross-sectional study
suggested that both blood mercury and
serum dioxin levels are associated with
increased risk of insulin resistance, and
that simultaneous exposure additionally
increases the risk (40).

In conclusion, results from this meta-
analysis indicate differences between geo-
graphical regions in observed associations
of total ﬁsh consumption and dietary
intake of long-chain n-3 fatty acids with
risk of type 2 diabetes, with an increased

risk among studies conducted in the
U.S., no association in European popula-
tions, and an inverse association in Asian/
Australian populations. In consideration
of the heterogeneous results, as well as the
cardiovascular beneﬁts associated with the
studied exposures, the relationship and
its possible mechanisms warrant further in-
vestigation. Types of ﬁsh consumed (lean,
fatty, shellﬁsh), dietary factors in ﬁsh, as
well as preparation methods and levels of
contamination, which could vary across
different countries, should be comprehen-
sively investigated when the potential role
of ﬁsh and long-chain n-3 fatty acids in the
development of type 2 diabetes is exam-
ined in future studies.
