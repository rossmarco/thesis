abstract

background
Despite the popularity of the low-carbohydrate, high-protein, high-fat (Atkins) diet, no
randomized, controlled trials have evaluated its efficacy.

methods
We conducted a one-year, multicenter, controlled trial involving 63 obese men and wom-
en who were randomly assigned to either a low-carbohydrate, high-protein, high-fat diet
or a low-calorie, high-carbohydrate, low-fat (conventional) diet. Professional contact
was minimal to replicate the approach used by most dieters.

results
Subjects on the low-carbohydrate diet had lost more weight than subjects on the con-

the difference at 12 months was not significant (¡4.4
6.7 vs. ¡2.5
6.3 percent of body
weight, P=0.26). After three months, no significant differences were found between
the groups in total or low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations. The increase
in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations and the decrease in triglyceride
concentrations were greater among subjects on the low-carbohydrate diet than among
those on the conventional diet throughout most of the study. Both diets significantly
decreased diastolic blood pressure and the insulin response to an oral glucose load.

conclusions
The low-carbohydrate diet produced a greater weight loss (absolute difference, approxi-
mately 4 percent) than did the conventional diet for the first six months, but the differenc-
es were not significant at one year. The low-carbohydrate diet was associated with a great-
er improvement in some risk factors for coronary heart disease. Adherence was poor
and attrition was high in both groups. Longer and larger studies are required to deter-
mine the long-term safety and efficacy of low-carbohydrate, high-protein, high-fat diets.

Despite its longevity and popularity, no random-

have been published.
 Data from short-term, un-

We conducted a one-year, multicenter, random-
ized, controlled trial to evaluate the effect of the low-
carbohydrate, high-protein, high-fat Atkins diet on
weight loss and risk factors for coronary heart dis-
ease in obese persons. The subjects were randomly
assigned to follow either a low-carbohydrate, high-
protein, high-fat Atkins diet or a high-carbohydrate,
low-fat,  energy-deficit  conventional  diet.  Profes-
sional contact was minimal, so as to approximate
the approach used by most dieters.

methods

subjects
A total of 63 persons (43 women and 20 men) par-
ticipated in the study (Table 1). All subjects complet-
ed a comprehensive medical examination and rou-
tine blood tests. Potential subjects were excluded if
they had clinically significant illnesses, including
type 2 diabetes; were taking lipid-lowering medica-
tions; were pregnant or lactating; or were taking
medications  that  affect  body  weight.  All  subjects
provided written informed consent, and the proto-
col was approved by the institutional review boards
of the participating institutions.

study design
The subjects were randomly assigned at each site,
with use of a random-number generator, to follow

either the low-carbohydrate diet or the convention-
al diet. Subjects in both groups were instructed to
take a daily multivitamin supplement and met with
a registered dietitian for 15 to 30 minutes at 3, 6,
and 12 months to review dietary issues.

Low-Carbohydrate Diet
The 33 subjects who were assigned to the low-car-
bohydrate, high-protein, high-fat diet met individ-
ually with a registered dietitian before beginning the
program to review the central features of the diet
(available as Supplementary Appendix 1 with the
full  text  of  this  article  at  http://www.nejm.org),
which involves limiting carbohydrate intake with-
out restricting consumption of fat and protein. For
the first two weeks, carbohydrate intake is limited

a stable and desired weight is achieved. Each sub-
Dr. Atkins’ New Diet Revolu-
ject was given a copy of 
tion,
 which details the Atkins diet program. Sub-
jects were instructed to read the book and follow
the diet as described.

Conventional Diet
The 30 subjects who were assigned to the conven-
tional diet also met with a registered dietitian before
beginning the program to review the components of
a high-carbohydrate, low-fat, low-calorie diet (1200
to 1500 kcal per day for women and 1500 to 1800
kcal per day for men, with approximately 60 percent
of calories from carbohydrate, 25 percent from fat,
and 15 percent from protein) and to receive instruc-
tions about calorie counting. Subjects were given a
17
copy of 
which provides 16 lessons covering various aspects
of weight control. The nutritional information in
the manual was consistent with the dietary recom-
mendations provided by the study dietitian and with
the Department of Agriculture Food Guide Pyra-
mid.
 Subjects were instructed to read the manual
and follow the program as described.

outcomes
Body weight was measured with the use of calibrat-
ed scales (Detecto 6800, Cardinal) while the subjects
were wearing light clothing and no shoes at base
line and at weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 26, 34, 42, and
52. Blood pressure and urinary ketones were also
assessed at base line and at weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20,
26, 34, 42, and 52. Blood samples were obtained af-
ter subjects fasted overnight at base line and at 3, 6,
and 12 months to determine serum lipoprotein con-
centrations. An oral glucose-tolerance test was per-
formed at base line and at 3, 6, and 12 months. After
subjects fasted overnight, blood samples were ob-
tained for the measurement of plasma glucose and
insulin concentrations before and 30, 60, 90, and
120 minutes after the oral administration of a 75-g
glucose load. In addition, insulin sensitivity, based
on fasting plasma glucose and insulin concentra-
tions, was assessed with the use of quantitative in-
: 1÷[(log fasting se-
sulin-sensitivity check index
rum insulin level, in microunits per milliliter)+(log
fasting glucose level, in milligrams per deciliter)].

were assayed according to procedures recommend-
ed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
19
and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute.
The low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol con-
centration was calculated according to the Friede-
wald formula
 in all but one subject, who had a tri-
glyceride concentration greater than 400 mg per
deciliter (4.52 mmol per liter). Plasma insulin was
measured by radioimmunoassay, and plasma glu-
cose  by  a  glucose  oxidase  autoanalyzer  (Yellow
Springs  Instruments).  The  area  under  the  curve
(AUC) for the plasma glucose concentration and for

the insulin concentration was calculated.
ketone  concentrations  were  measured  with  dip-
sticks (Ketostix 2880, Bayer) and characterized di-
chotomously as negative (0 mg per deciliter) or pos-
itive (5 to 100 mg per deciliter).

21

statistical analysis
Analysis of variance revealed no effects of the re-
search site on weight loss or attrition at 3, 6, or 12
months, so the data on all the subjects were ana-
lyzed together. A t-test for independent samples was
used to assess differences in base-line variables be-
tween the groups. Two sets of analyses were con-
ducted. The primary analysis was a repeated-meas-
ures analysis of variance in which the base-line value
was carried forward in the case of missing data. In a
secondary analysis, an analysis of covariance (in
which initial weights were covariates) was used to
examine changes in weight from base line to the end
of the study, for those who completed the study, or
at the time of the last follow-up visit, for those who
did not complete the study. A chi-square analysis
was performed to determine differences between
groups in categorical variables, and correlations
with categorical variables were assessed with Spear-
man’s rho coefficient. Triglyceride values were not
normally distributed, so the log-transformed val-
ues  were  analyzed.  Results  are  presented  as  per-
cent changes to facilitate clinical interpretation, al-
though  all  analyses  involved  absolute  values  and
were conducted with the use of SPSS software (ver-
sion 11.0).

results

weight
In the analysis in which base-line values were car-
ried forward in the case of missing values, the group
on the low-carbohydrate diet had lost significantly
more weight than the group on the conventional

diet at 3 months (P=0.001) and 6 months (P=0.02),
but the difference in weight loss was not statistical-
ly significant at 12 months (P=0.26) (Table 2 and
Fig. 1A).

attrition
A total of 49 subjects completed 3 months of the
study (28 on the low-carbohydrate diet and 21 on the
conventional diet), 42 subjects completed 6 months
(24  on  the  low-carbohydrate  diet  and  18  on  the
conventional diet), and 37 subjects completed 12
months (20 on the low-carbohydrate diet and 17
on the conventional diet). The percentage of sub-
jects who had dropped out of the study at 3, 6, and
12 months was higher in the group following the
conventional diet (30, 40, and 43 percent, respec-
tively) than in the group following the low-carbo-
hydrate diet (15, 27, and 39 percent, respectively),
but these differences were not statistically signifi-
cant. Overall, 59 percent of subjects completed the
study, and 88 percent of those who completed the

to that obtained when the base-line values were car-
ried forward in the case of missing data. Subjects
on the low-carbohydrate diet lost significantly more
weight than the subjects on the conventional diet
at 3 months (P=0.002) and 6 months (P=0.03), but
the difference in weight loss was not statistically sig-
nificant at 12 months (P=0.27) (Table 3 and Fig. 1B).

urinary ketones
During the first three months, the percentage of pa-
tients who tested positive for urinary ketones was
significantly greater in the group on the low-carbo-
hydrate diet than in the group on the conventional
diet (Fig. 2), but there were no significant differenc-
es between the groups after three months. There was
no significant relation between weight loss and ke-
tosis at any time during the study.

blood pressure
Systolic  blood  pressure  did  not  change  signifi-
cantly in either group during the study (Tables 2
and 3). Diastolic pressure decreased in both groups,
but there were no significant differences between
groups.

oral glucose-tolerance test
The area under the glucose curve did not change
significantly in either group throughout the study.
The area under the insulin curve decreased in both
groups, but there were no significant differences
between groups (Tables 2 and 3). There were no sig-
nificant differences between groups in insulin sen-
sitivity (assessed by the quantitative insulin-sensi-
) throughout the study period.
tivity check index
Both  groups  had  significant  increases  in  insulin
sensitivity at six months, but the values were not sig-
nificantly different from base line at one year (Ta-
bles 2 and 3).

serum lipoproteins
The effects of the diets on serum lipoproteins are
shown in Tables 2 and 3 and Figure 3. There were
no  significant  differences  between  groups  in  the
total  or  LDL  cholesterol  concentration,  except  at
month 3, when values were significantly lower in
the group on the conventional diet than in the group
on the low-carbohydrate diet. In contrast, the rela-

tive increase in HDL cholesterol concentrations and
the relative decrease in triglyceride concentrations
were greater in the group on the low-carbohydrate
diet  than  in  the  group  on  the  conventional  diet
throughout  most  of  the  study.  The  results  of  the
analyses that included data on subjects who com-
pleted the study and data obtained at the time of the
last follow-up visit for those who did not complete
the study (Table 3) were nearly identical to the analy-
ses in which base-line values were carried forward
in the case of missing data (Table 2) with respect to
blood pressure, insulin sensitivity, and serum lipo-
proteins.

discussion

The results of this multicenter, randomized, con-
trolled trial demonstrate that the low-carbohydrate,
high-protein, high-fat Atkins diet produces greater
weight loss (an absolute difference of approximate-
ly 4 percent) than a conventional high-carbohydrate,
low-fat diet for up to six months, but that the dif-
ferences do not persist at one year. The magnitude
of weight loss at six months in the low-carbohydrate
group approximates that achieved by standard be-
 treatments. These
havioral
weight losses are particularly noteworthy because
the diet was implemented in a self-help format and
subjects had little contact with health profession-
als. The lack of a statistically significant difference
between the groups at one year is most likely due to
greater weight regain in the low-carbohydrate group
and the small sample size. These data suggest that
long-term adherence to the low-carbohydrate Atkins
diet may be difficult.

 and pharmacologic

The difference in weight loss between the two
groups in the first six months demonstrates an over-
all greater energy deficit in the low-carbohydrate
group, despite unrestricted protein and fat intake in
this group and instructions to restrict energy intake
in the conventional-diet group. When the energy
content of an energy-deficit diet is stable, macro-
nutrient  composition  does  not  influence  weight
loss.
 The mechanism responsible for the de-
creased energy intake induced by a low-carbohy-
drate diet with unrestricted protein and fat intake
is not known but may be related to the monotony or
simplicity of the diet, alterations in plasma or cen-
tral satiety factors, or other factors that affect appe-
tite and dietary adherence. Our data suggest that
ketosis was unlikely to be responsible for the in-
creased weight loss with the low-carbohydrate diet,

since we did not find any relation between the pres-
ence of urinary ketones and weight loss. Further-
more, urinary ketones were not present in most sub-
jects on either diet after the first six months.

Although subjects with diabetes were excluded
from our study, many — if not most — of our sub-
jects, because of their obesity, were probably insu-
29
lin-resistant with respect to glucose metabolism.
Treatment with either diet was associated with an
improvement in insulin sensitivity as determined by
an oral glucose-tolerance test; progressively less in-
sulin was secreted to maintain the same blood glu-
cose concentrations. These data do not demonstrate
an effect of macronutrient composition, independ-
ent of weight loss, on insulin sensitivity in obese
subjects without diabetes. However, the results of
these metabolic studies should be interpreted with
caution, given the study’s relatively small sample
size and the one-year duration. Additional studies in
which more precise measures of insulin sensitivi-
ty are used are needed to evaluate this issue more
carefully.

An important health concern of consuming un-
restricted amounts of saturated fat is the potential to
increase the LDL cholesterol concentration, which
is an established risk factor for coronary heart dis-
ease. In fact, at three months, the LDL cholesterol
concentration tended to increase in the subjects on
the low-carbohydrate diet but decreased in the sub-
jects on the conventional diet, so the difference be-

Figure 3. Mean (±SE) Percent Change in Serum Concentrations of Triglycerides (Panel A), Total Cholesterol (Panel B), 
Low-Density Lipoprotein (LDL) Cholesterol (Panel C), and High-Density Lipoprotein (HDL) Cholesterol (Panel D) 
among Subjects on the Low-Carbohydrate Diet and Those on the Conventional (Low-Calorie, High-Carbohydrate) Diet.
Data were obtained at the end of the study for subjects who completed the study and at the time of the last follow-up visit 
for those who did not complete the study. The low-carbohydrate group had 28 subjects at 3 months, 24 subjects at 6 months, 
and 20 subjects at 12 months. The conventional-diet group had 21 subjects at 3 months, 18 subjects at 6 months, and 
17 subjects at 12 months. Asterisks indicate a significant difference (P<0.05) between the groups.

tween groups was significant. Over the long term,
however, the LDL cholesterol concentration among
subjects on the low-carbohydrate diet was similar to
base-line values, and the changes in LDL cholesterol
concentrations did not differ significantly between
the groups. These data suggest that the increased
weight loss associated with the low-carbohydrate
diet may offset the adverse effect of saturated fat
intake on serum LDL cholesterol concentrations.
Nonetheless, weight loss with the low-carbohydrate
diet was not associated with the decreases in LDL
cholesterol usually observed with moderate weight
loss.

In contrast, the low-carbohydrate diet was as-
sociated with greater decreases in serum triglycer-
ides and greater increases in HDL cholesterol than
was the conventional diet, and the levels of both

disease.

contributed to the improvement in the HDL cho-
lesterol–triglyceride axis. High-carbohydrate, low-
fat diets decrease HDL cholesterol concentrations
34-37
and increase serum triglyceride concentrations,
whereas low-carbohydrate, high-fat diets decrease
triglyceride concentrations
 and increase HDL
cholesterol concentrations.
 Moreover, replacing
dietary  polyunsaturated  or  monounsaturated  fat
with carbohydrate is associated with an increased
risk of coronary heart disease, as predicted by chang-
es in triglyceride and HDL cholesterol concentra-
tions.

The overall effect of the low-carbohydrate diet
in comparison with a conventional diet on the risk
of coronary heart disease in our subjects is uncer-
tain. As compared with the conventional diet, the
low-carbohydrate diet was associated with a greater
improvement in some risk factors for coronary heart
disease (serum triglycerides and serum HDL choles-
terol), but not others (blood pressure, insulin sen-
sitivity, and serum LDL cholesterol). Moreover, the
clinical significance of the favorable changes in the
HDL cholesterol–triglyceride axis in the setting of
a high fat intake is not clear. Additional, long-term
studies are needed to determine whether increased
serum  HDL  cholesterol  concentrations  and  de-
creased serum triglyceride concentrations have the
same effect on cardiovascular outcomes when one
is consuming a diet high in saturated fat. It is also
possible that the large amount of saturated fats and
small amounts of fruits, vegetables, and fiber con-
sumed during the low-carbohydrate diet can inde-
pendently increase the risk of coronary heart dis-
ease.
  Therefore,  at  the  present  time,  there  is
not enough information to determine whether the
beneficial effects of the Atkins diet outweigh its po-
tential adverse effects on the risk of coronary heart
disease in obese persons.

Our study has several limitations. The self-help
nature of treatment, which is consistent with the
way in which the low-carbohydrate diet is typically
used, probably contributed to the attrition rate of
41 percent. This high rate of attrition underscores
the difficulty of long-term compliance with either
diet, when diet therapy is given with minimal super-
vision. More comprehensive behavioral treatment
(e.g., weekly group meetings or self-monitoring)
would probably have decreased attrition, increased
adherence, and made possible a comparison with

focused on weight and specific risk factors for cor-
onary heart disease. We did not evaluate the effect
of  the  low-carbohydrate  diet  on  other  important
clinical  end  points,  such  as  renal  function,  bone
health, cardiovascular function, and exercise toler-
ance. Finally, our findings should not be general-
ized to overweight subjects or to obese subjects with
serious obesity-related diseases, such as diabetes
and hypercholesterolemia. Additional studies are
needed in these populations to evaluate the safety
and  efficacy  of  low-carbohydrate,  high-protein,
high-fat diets.
