Objectives: There is substantial evidence that type 2 diabetes in-
creases with the degree and duration of obesity. This study was con-
ducted to examine the association, at the international level, between
fish and seafood consumption and the prevalence of type 2 diabetes,
taking into account the prevalence of obesity.
Methods: An ecological study of 41 countries in five continents with
different socio-demographic characteristics and sanitary conditions
was carried out. Data on the prevalence of diabetes and obesity as well
as food balance sheets were collected from websites. Correlations
between the variables studied were followed by an exploration of their
interaction.
Results: After adjustment for total energy intake, there was a signifi-
cant correlation (ρ = 0.81, P < 0.0001) between the prevalence of type
2 diabetes in the 20- to 44- and 45- to 64-year age groups. Type 2
diabetes in the 45- to 64-year age group was about 5 times higher than
in the 20- to 44-year age group. Obesity was positively associated with
type 2 diabetes in both age groups (ρ = 0.39; P = 0.012 and ρ = 0.48; P
= 0.002 in the 20- to 44- and 45- to 64-year age groups, respectively).
An interaction effect was found between diabetes, obesity and total
fish and seafood consumption. In countries with low fish and seafood
consumption, the prevalence of type 2 diabetes increased significantly
with obesity (0.8 ± 0.3% vs. 2.5 ± 1.8%; P = 0.002 and 3.3 ± 2.6% vs.
11.0 ± 3.9%; P < 0.0001 for the 20- to 44- and 45- to 64-year age
groups, respectively). In countries with a greater prevalence of obe-
sity, there was evidence of significantly reduced type 2 diabetes with
high fish and seafood consumption (2.5 ± 1.8% vs. 0.9 ± 0.7%; P =
0.007 and 11.0 ± 3.9% vs. 6.2 ± 4.1%; P = 0.041 for the 20- to 44-
and 45- to 64-year age groups, respectively).
Conclusion: The results of this study suggest that high fish and sea-
food intake may reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes in populations with a
high prevalence of obesity.

Consommation de poisson et fruits de mer,
obésité, et risque de diabète de type 2 :
une étude écologique
Objectif : Plusieurs études épidémiologiques montrent que le risque
de diabète de type 2 augmente avec le niveau d’obésité et la durée de
cette maladie. L’objectif de cette étude vise à examiner l’association
entre la quantité de poisson et fruits de mer disponible pour la
consommation et la prévalence du diabète de type 2.
Méthodes : Suivant un devis d’étude écologique, les données de pré-
valence du diabète, de l’obésité et des bilans alimentaires ont été
examinées. Ces données proviennent de différents sites Internet sur
41 pays ayant des conditions socio-démographiques et sanitaires dif-
férentes. Les corrélations entre les différentes variables ont été calcu-
lées.
Résultats : Les résultats indiquent une forte corrélation significative
(ρ = 0,81; P < 0,0001) entre la prévalence de diabète de type 2 chez les
20-44 ans et celle des 45-64 ans. La prévalence de la maladie chez les
45-64 ans est d’environ cinq fois plus élevée que celle observée chez
les 20-44 ans. L’obésité est corrélée positivement au diabète de type 2
(0,39; P = 0,012) chez les 20-44, et (0,48; P = 0,002) chez les 45-64
ans. Un effet d’interaction a été mis en évidence entre la quantité
disponible de poisson et fruits de mer, le diabète de type 2, et l’obésité.
Dans les pays à faible consommation de poisson et fruits de mer, la
prévalence du diabète de type 2 augmente significativement avec
l’obésité chez de 20-44 ans (0,8 ± 0,3 % contre 2,5 ± 1,8 %; P =
0,002) et chez les 45-64 ans (3,3 ± 2,6 % contre 11,0 ± 3,9 %,
P < 0,0001). Dans les pays à forte prévalence d’obésité, une réduction
significative de la prévalence du diabète de type 2 est observée en
présence d’une forte consommation de poisson et fruits de mer chez
les 20-44 ans (2,5 ± 1,8 % contre 0,9 ± 0,7 %; P = 0,007) et chez les
45-64 ans (et 11,0 ± 3,9 % contre 6,2 ± 4,1 %; P = 0,041).
Conclusion : Les résultats de cette étude suggèrent qu’une consom-
mation élevée de poisson et fruits de mer réduise l’occurrence du
diabète de type 2 dans la population à forte prévalence d’obésité.

A high increase of diabetes occurrence in several

countries is making the disease one of the most
important in this millennium. It is currently esti-
mated that 120 to 140 million people suffer from diabetes
throughout the world, and this number will double by the
year 2025 [1].

Obesity is a major established risk factor of type 2 diabe-
tes [2]. A number of epidemiological studies [3, 4] have
shown that type 2 diabetes risk increases exponentially with
the degree and duration of obesity. Taking into account the
importance of this epidemic and the significant incidence of
obesity, several strategies have been developed to reverse this
trend. Reducing the overall intake of fat and saturated fat
while increasing whole-grain and cereal fiber intake, and
physical activity can lower the incidence of type 2 diabetes [5,
6]. Beneficial effects of diets high in monounsaturated [7, 8]
and polyunsaturated [9] fatty acids relative to low-fat, high-
carbohydrate diets on glucose control and insulin sensitivity
have also been reported. A high intake of ω-3 fatty acids,
mainly found in fish and seafood, may also constitute an
avenue of interest. It has been shown in both animals and
humans that a diet rich in ω-3 fatty acid induces not only
insulin release by (cid:3) cells, but also optimizes insulin action at
the peripheral level [10-15]. However, the effect of these
fatty acids depends on the diabetic or normoglycemic state
[16-18]. In diabetic subjects, ω-3 fatty acids do not signifi-
cantly alter glycemic control although they lower triglycer-
ides and raise LDL cholesterol [19]. A protective influence of
ω-3 fatty acids has been documented in Alaskan Natives
[20], a population with a rising prevalence of glucose intoler-
ance [21], and in the elderly [22, 23], an age-group with
greater incidence of type 2 diabetes.

Using online databases, this study was undertaken to ex-
amine whether there was evidence of a relationship between
fish-seafood consumption, a proxy for ω-3 fatty acids intake,
and the prevalence of type 2 diabetes, considering the exist-
ing relationship between obesity and type 2 diabetes.

Data and methods

Online diabetes, obesity and dietary data were available

for 41 countries.

Type 2 diabetes

The official website (http:

//www.who.int/ncd/dia/
databas.htm) of the World Health Organization (WHO) es-
timates the number of diabetics worldwide from 1995 to
2025. Data for both the 20- to 44- and 45- to 64-year age
groups were retained in this study. From the demographic
yearbook of the United Nations [24], which provides esti-
mates of the world population from 1950 to 2025, the preva-
lence of diabetes was computed for these two age groups,
using the population distribution in each country for the
year 2000. As type 2 diabetes represents 85-95% of the overall

636

Diabetes Metab 2003,29,635-42 • www.e2med.com/dm

diabetic population [1], 90% of the total number of diabetic
subjects in 2000 were considered in this computation.

Prevalence of obesity

Data were obtained from the results of either national
investigations published on the Internet [25-29] or interna-
tional projects deploying similar protocols. “Demographic
and Health Surveys”, an international research consultancy,
has released on its website data on the prevalence of under-
weight and overweight women 20-49 years old in 16 Afri-
can, 3 Asian and 10 Latin American countries [30]. EU-
RALIM (EURope ALIMentation), a collaborative project
comprising seven local high quality studies, compared the
population data from these studies using an harmonization
approach [31]. We were able to obtain information on 41
countries. The WHO international classification of obesity
was considered (body mass index, BMI ≥ 30). Because a
large number of studies have focused on females, the preva-
lence of obesity among adult women was considered an indi-
cator of obesity in the population. Only investigations using
the BMI and for which weight and height were measured by
healthcare personnel were taken into account.

Fish and seafood consumption

The online database of the Food and Agriculture Or-
ganisation of the United Nations (FAOSTAT) provides
food balance sheets for all countries. Food balance sheets
estimate the quantities of fish-seafood available for human
consumption. For each of the 41 countries studied, per capita
data on fish-seafood consumption were obtained by compu-
tation of the annual average of these products for 12 consecu-
tive years, from 1989 to 2000.

Analytical method

The data were analyzed with SPSS for WINDOWS
(version 10.01, SPSS, Inc., 1989-1999). Partial correlations
between total fish-seafood consumption, prevalence of type
2 diabetes and obesity are presented, while controlling for
dietary energy supply. Since an interaction effect was ob-
served between obesity, fish-seafood consumption and type
2 diabetes, the 41 countries were classified according to the
prevalence of type 2 diabetes by their levels of fish-seafood
consumed (< or ≥ 11kg/capita/year) and the prevalence of
obesity (< or ≥ 7.5%). The cut-off points were chosen to
maximize cell sizes. This gave a total of four groups of coun-
tries, and in each group, the prevalence of type 2 diabetes was
computed for each age bracket (20 to 44 and 45 to 64 years).
Groups of countries were then compared by the One-Way
ANOVA procedure to test the hypothesis that the means
across the formed cells are equal (Scheffé’s multiple com-
parisons).

Results

The list and characteristics of the various countries are
presented in Table I. The prevalence of type 2 diabetes in the
20- to 44-year age group ranged for 0.2% in France and
Switzerland to 5.6% in Egypt, while rates in the 45- to 64-
year age group ranged from 1.2% in Uganda to 17.8% in
Egypt. The prevalence of type 2 diabetes in the latter age
group was approximately 5-fold higher than in the 20- to
44-year age group. Higher rates of type 2 diabetes were
found in some Middle East and Maghreb countries. The
prevalence in Saudi Arabia ranged from 4.5% to 15.5% for
the 20- to 44- and 45- to 64-year age groups, respectively. In
Egypt, the rates were 5.6% for the 20- to 44-year age group
and 17.8% for the 45- to 64-year age group.

Nepal exhibited the lowest prevalence of obesity (0.1%),
while the highest was found in the USA (22.5%). In general,
sub-Saharan countries presented the lowest prevalence of
type 2 diabetes and obesity, as well as the lowest dietary
energy supply.

There was a wide variation in total fish-seafood con-
sumption, with a yearly average per capita of 12.2 kg. Spain
and Finland were the biggest consumers with 38.5 kg and
34.8 kg per capita, respectively.

The partial correlation coefficients between the study
variables are shown in Table II. As expected, the prevalence
of type 2 diabetes in the 20- to 44-year age group was strongly
and positively correlated with that in the 45-to 64-year age
group (ρ = 0.81; P < 0.0001), as well as with obesity and this
association grew stronger with age (ρ = 0.48; P = 0.002 in the
45- to 64-year age group), after adjustment for dietary en-
ergy supply. Total fish-seafood consumption per capita was
inversely correlated with type 2 diabetes (ρ = – 0.33; P =
0.039 and ρ = – 0.34; P = 0.032 in the 20- to 44- and 45- to
64-year age groups, respectively).

An important interaction was detected and presented in
Table III. Countries with low fish-seafood consumption
showed type 2 diabetes prevalence increasing significantly
with obesity (0.8 ± 0.3% vs. 2.5 ± 1.8%; P = 0.002 and
3.3 ± 2.6% vs. 11.0 ± 3.9%, P < 0.0001 for the 20- to 44- and
45- to 64-year age groups, respectively). In the presence of
high fish-seafood consumption, however, there was no sig-
nificant difference in the prevalence of type 2 diabetes be-
tween groups of countries with low or high prevalence of
obesity.

No significant difference was noted in the prevalence of
type 2 diabetes between the study countries with low preva-
lence of obesity, regardless of their total fish-seafood con-
sumption. Interestingly, in the presence of a greater preva-
lence of obesity, there was evidence of significantly reduced
type 2 diabetes with high fish-seafood consumption
(2.5 ± 1.8% vs. 0.9 ± 0.7%, P = 0.007 and 11.0 ± 3.9% vs.
6.2 ± 4.1%, P = 0.041 for the 20- to 44- and 45- to 64-year age
groups, respectively). In addition, comparisons of the coun-
tries energy supply showed that the group with high obesity,

high type 2 diabetes rates, and low fish-seafood consumption
did not differ from the other 3 groups (data not shown).

Discussion

The prevalence of type 2 diabetes in the 45- to 64-year age
group was approximately 5-fold higher than in the 20- to
44-year age group, a finding consistent with others showing
age as an important risk factor for type 2 diabetes [32, 33].
The results of this study indicate also a strong, positive rela-
tionship between obesity and type 2 diabetes, a relationship
that grew stronger with age, which is in agreement with
findings documented at the individual level [2, 32]. These
observations tend to land support to the reliability of the
datasets. Greater rates of type 2 diabetes and obesity have
been found in developed countries. Urbanization/
industrialization may play a major role in the incidence of
these chronic diseases.

The geographic proximity of the sea as well as the ecol-
ogy of these countries did not seem to dictate the overall
consumption of fish and seafood. The annual average per
capita intake of fish and seafood of the countries studied was
12.2 kg, approximately 235 g per week. Although there were
variations in fish and seafood consumption, this quantity is
in agreement with dietary recommendations, namely 230 g
or 8 oz of fish representing one fish dish per week [34], the
same quantity found to be beneficial for cardiovascular
health [35].

We noted that total fish and seafood consumption modi-
fies the relationship between type 2 diabetes and obesity. In
countries with low quantities of fish and seafood available
for human consumption, the prevalence of type 2 diabetes is
positively and significantly associated with obesity, while
there is no evidence of an association in countries with high
fish-seafood consumption. Moreover, in the presence of a
low rate of obesity, we observed no significant difference in
the prevalence of type 2 diabetes between groups of countries
with low and high levels of fish-seafood consumption. How-
ever, among both age groups, there was evidence of a signifi-
cant reduction in the prevalence of type 2 diabetes with high
fish-seafood consumption. This finding suggests that high
fish and seafood intake modifies the detrimental effect of
obesity on type 2 diabetes. Our results seem consistent with
those obtained at the individual level by the teams of Feskens
[22, 23], Ekblond [36] and Adler [20]. Feskens et al. [22, 23]
reported a protective effect of fish intake against the devel-
opment of glucose intolerance and type 2 diabetes in indi-
viduals aged 64 years and over consuming 170g of fish per
week. Ekblond et al. [36] observed a significant reduction of
urinary glucose excretion, a predictor of type 2 diabetes,
among women aged 50 to 64 years old who tended to con-
sume more fish. Adler et al. [20] found that daily salmon
consumption was associated with a 50% lower risk of glu-
cose intolerance, a condition now categorized as a stage in
the natural history of disordered carbohydrate metabolism

which refers to an intermediate between normal glucose ho-
meostasis and diabetes [37]. It is possible that the protective
effect of fish and seafood revealed in our study may have
been due to ω-3 fatty acids, since these products are their
main sources. A beneficial effect of ω-3 fatty acids on type 2
diabetes was noted in animal experiments and epidemiologi-
cal studies [38]. Conversely, this effect was not apparent with
the Iowa Women’s Study cohort [39] or in the KANWU
study [40].

Our protocol was designed to use databases obtained
from websites. The data on diabetes were homogeneous be-
cause the diagnostic criteria and diabetes classification were
the same for all countries, and the age groups were identical.
Moreover, these data derive from the same dataset of the
WHO. However, the rates reported may be underestimated,
since undiagnosed diabetes was not necessarily counted; re-
cent estimates indicate that about 50% of all persons with
diabetes have not been diagnosed [41].

Food balance sheets also came from an online database,
FAOSTAT. These food balance sheets present a compre-
hensive picture of the pattern of a country’s food supply
during a specified reference period. They estimate the quan-
tities of food available for human consumption that reach
the consumer, and waste during distribution and processing
is taken into consideration. As fish and seafood are expen-
sive, it is logical to consider that when they are purchased,
they are really consumed. Thus, it seems relevant to use food
balance sheets for the measurement of not only apparent fish
and seafood intake, but also of ω-3 fatty acid exposure since
fish and seafood are their principal sources.

However, this study has some limitations. Data on fish
and seafood were no doubt substantially underestimated.
Food balance sheets do not necessarily take into account fish-
ery products of subsistence, practiced in most countries near
territorial and maritime waters, particularly in developing

countries. It is possible that this biased our results in such a
way that the poorest countries are undoubtedly those where
information is questionable, and an important part of local
fish and seafood is consumed but not necessarily recorded.
Thus, there may be a tendency to underestimate the quantity
of fish and seafood consumed in developing countries. How-
ever, such a bias may be conservative and may not have af-
fected the direction of the associations we observed.

The prevalence of obesity in the various countries was
difficult to estimate. The online database on obesity and
BMI is announced on the official website of the WHO, but is
not yet accessible. To make the various countries compa-
rable, we used WHO criteria (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2) and selected
only females since the majority of
investigators have
sampled women. Sometimes, the age groups targeted for the
determination of obesity prevalence were not identical in all
the countries studied. In such cases, the prevalence of obesity
in the overall population was considered. This limitation,
related to harmonization of the prevalence of obesity in dif-
ferent countries, is also likely to have affected our results.
However, if the prevalence of obesity in the general popula-
tion is valid, then we can assume that the prevalence in the
two age groups would also be valid. Moreover, some data
were obtained in 1995, and the reported rate of obesity may
now be underestimated. Indeed, obesity remains a major
public health problem in virtually all countries. Obesity rises
sharply and affects all age groups. In the USA, it was re-
ported that in only one year, from 1998 to 1999, a 6% increase
was recorded in the prevalence of obesity. This increase was
found in males and females of all age groups in all areas and
at all socio-economic and educational levels [42]. It is, there-
fore, logical to consider that an elevated prevalence of obesity
would be anticipated in several countries from our database,
and thus the direction of the reported association may not
have changed. Furthermore, dietary energy supply may not

have been responsible for the observed association since the
group of countries we identified with high obesity, low fish-
seafood consumption, and high type 2 diabetes did not sig-
nificantly differ from the others in dietary energy supply.
This particular group seems to be a group of countries in fast
transition.

This study may also be subject to biases inherent in these
exploratory methods, the “ecological fallacy” being a fore-

warning whereby the associations we reported might reflect
other unmeasured variables linked to quantities of fish and
seafood available for human consumption. In that event, the
associations observed at the national level may not necessar-
ily reflect the individual level. Nevertheless, given the exist-
ing information obtained from animal as well as human
studies [21-23, 36, 43], the present ecological investigation
supports the hypothesis that high fish and seafood intake

may reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes in populations with a
high prevalence of obesity. Further work at the individual
level is needed to evaluate whether higher fish and seafood
intake could be encouraged, particularly among overweight
or obese individuals, given their high risk of developing type
2 diabetes.
