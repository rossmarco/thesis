Background and aims: Diabetes is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD), yet
Abstract
southern European migrants to Australia with high rates of type 2 diabetes have relatively low
CVD mortality. Our aim was to determine whether a Mediterranean style diet could reduce
mortality in people with diabetes.
Methods and results: Participants included 16,610 males and 23,860 females from the Mel-
bourne Collaborative Cohort Study; 25% were born in Greece or Italy, and 2150 had previously
been diagnosed with diabetes or had elevated blood glucose at baseline (1990e94). Data on
demographic, behavioral and physical risk factors were also collected. A personal Mediterra-
nean Diet Score (MDS) was calculated using data from a validated 121-item food frequency
questionnaire. Total and CVD mortality data were available up to 2003.

Diabetes (new and known) at baseline, was associated with total mortality (men HR 1.43,
95%CI 1.26e1.62; women HR 1.86 95%CI 1.58e2.18), and CVD mortality (men HR 1.53, 95%CI
1.21e1.94; women HR 2.10 95%CI 1.48e2.97) in multivariate models. There was no evidence
that glucose tolerance modiﬁed the associations between MDS and total or CVD mortality (p
interaction all > 0.16). The HRs for total mortality per unit of MDS were 0.96 (95% CI
0.93e0.99) in men and 0.94 (95% CI 0.92e0.97) in women. The HRs for CVD mortality per unit
of MDS were 0.94 (95% CI 0.89e0.99) in men and 0.94 (95% CI 0.87e1.01) in women.

Introduction

Coronary heart disease risk is increased in the presence of
type 2 diabetes [1]. Despite an elevated risk of type 2
diabetes [2;3], migrants from southern Europe to Australia
have a lower risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) than those
born in Australia [4]. Closer adherence to a Mediterranean
style diet has been linked with lower total and cardiovas-
cular mortality [5]. Current American Diabetes Association
(ADA) recommendations for medical nutrition therapy for
people with diabetes include many elements characteristic
of a Mediterranean diet: fruit, vegetables, legumes, whole
grains, ﬁsh, and low intakes of saturated fat and choles-
terol [6]. However, we are not aware of any other studies
looking at the association of a Mediterranean diet with
mortality in people with diabetes.

The Melbourne Collaborative Cohort Study (MCCS) [7]
provided an opportunity to examine the association
between diabetes and CVD mortality in a cohort including
25% of migrants from Greece and Italy, who have retained
features of their traditional diets despite over 50 years
residence in Australia. Speciﬁcally, we aimed to examine
whether adherence to a Mediterranean style diet can
reduce diabetes associated mortality risks.

Methods

Subjects

The MCCS is a prospective cohort study comprising 17,045
men and 24,469 women, aged between 27 and 75 years at
baseline (99.3% were aged 40e69 years). Study participants
were recruited from the Melbourne metropolitan area
between 1990 and 1994 via the Electoral Rolls, advertise-
ments, and community announcements. Southern European
migrants were deliberately over-sampled to extend the
range of lifestyle exposures. The Cancer Council Victoria’s
Human Research Ethics Committee approved the study
protocol. Further details of the study have been published
elsewhere [7]. After participants without a complete data
set, or with estimated energy intakes in the upper and
lower 1% of the sex speciﬁc distributions, were excluded
(included men had energy intakes 3761-25,390 kJ/d and
women 3149-21,395 kJ/d), 16,610 male and 23,860 female
participants were available for analysis. All participants
attended a study centre at baseline, where physical
measurements, blood sampling and interviewer-adminis-
tered questionnaires were completed.

Possible confounders

Height, weight, and waist and hip circumferences were
measured according to standard procedures [8]. Other

possible confounders identiﬁed a priori were: country of
birth (Australia, United Kingdom, Italy, Greece); physical
activity (none, low, moderate, high [9]); alcohol intake
(men: none, 1e39, 40e59, 60 þ g/d; women: none, 1e19,
20 þ g/d); education (primary school, some high or tech-
nical school, completed high or technical school, degree/
diploma); smoking status (never, past, current); living alone
(yes, no); previous history of illness (angina, heart attack,
cancer, stroke); family history (father, mother, or sibling)
of heart attack; plasma cholesterol; and hypertension
(SBP 140 mmHg or DBP  90 or use of antihypertensive
medication).

Dietary data

Dietary data were collected with a self-administered 121-
item food frequency questionnaire speciﬁcally developed
for the study [10]. Alcohol intake data were collected using
beverage speciﬁc frequency and quantity questions. A
Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) was computed based on
that described by Trichopoulou et al. [11]. For frequencies
of intake above the sex speciﬁc medians for vegetables,
fruit, cereals, legumes, and ﬁsh; and below the medians for
dairy and red meat (not chicken), participants were allo-
cated 1 point, or zero for intakes on the other side of the
median. For alcohol, 1 point was allocated for daily intakes
between 10 and 50 g/d for men and 5e25 g/d for women,
lower or higher intakes scored zero [11]. Trichopoulou et al.
used the ratio of dietary monounsaturated (MUFA):satu-
rated fats as the ninth component of the score [11] but we
used the intake of olive oil. In Australia, red meat is an
important source of MUFA [12]. Thus the score ranged from
0 for no adherence to a Mediterranean diet, to 9 for
a strongly Mediterranean style diet.

Mortality

Deaths were identiﬁed through the Victorian Registry of
Births, Deaths and Marriages, and the National Death
Index. Deaths records for Victoria were complete to
December 31, 2003, and to the end of 2002 for deaths in
other states. Residential addresses were determined by
record linkage to Electoral Rolls, from electronic phone
books, and from responses to mailed questionnaires and
newsletters. By the end of follow-up on December 31,
2003, 55 (0.2%) of the subjects included in this analysis
were known to have left Australia and were considered
lost to follow-up. Participants were deﬁned as having
died from CVD if the primary cause of death had an
International Classiﬁcation of Diseases
(ICD)-9 code
401.0e444.9 or ICD-10 code I00-I74. Deaths recorded in
1991 and 1992 were coded by the Victorian Cancer
Registry, while those post-1992 were coded by the
Australian Bureau of Statistics.

Glucose tolerance status

Plasma glucose at baseline was measured using a Kodak
Ektachem analyzer (Rochester, NY), and classiﬁed as normal
glucose tolerance (NGT) if fasting glucose < 6.1 mmol/l

or non-fasting glucose < 7.8 mmol/l and no previous diag-
nosis; impaired fasting glucose (IFG) if fasting glucose >
6.1 mmol/l and <7.0 mmol/l; impaired glucose tolerance
(IGT) if non-fasting glucose  7.8 mmol/l & <11.1 mmol/l
and no previous diagnosis; new diabetes if fasting glucose 

no previous diagnosis; and known diabetes if a previous
diagnosis of diabetes was reported. We did not differentiate
between type 1 and type 2 diabetes.

Statistical analysis

All analyses were performed separately for men and
women. Interactions between gender and glucose toler-
ance status were tested for each outcome. Models were run
with and without the interaction terms, and compared
using the likelihood ratio test. Cox proportional hazards
regression models, with age as the time axis, were used to
estimate the hazard ratios for mortality associated with
glucose tolerance status. The models with total mortality as
the outcome were stratiﬁed for previous history of illness
(angina, heart attack,
smoking and
education level at baseline for men, with smoking replaced
by living alone for women; because for these variables, the
hazards were found not to be proportional. Models for CVD
mortality were stratiﬁed by family history of heart attack
and smoking for men; family history of heart attack and
living alone for women. Two models were used, model 1
with no confounders included, and model 2 with the
confounders listed above.

stroke, cancer),

We then tested the hypothesis that closer adherence to
a Mediterranean diet would attenuate mortality in people
with diabetes. In sex speciﬁc multivariate models including
energy intake and the covariates
listed previously;
excluding participants with previously diagnosed diabetes

to avoid the possible confounding effect of dietary changes
in response to the diagnosis, the HR per unit increment in
MDS was calculated for total and CVD mortality. Interac-
tions between the MDS as a continuous variable, and
glucose tolerance status as 4 categories, with total and
CVD mortality as the outcomes were tested, as described
above. These analyses were also repeated including the
people with previously reported diabetes at baseline. Rates
of CVD mortality were also plotted across glucose tolerance
status for MDS above and below the median.

Results

There were 4082 deaths, including 874 CVD deaths, over
an average follow-up of 12.3 years. Table 1 shows the
characteristics of men and women across glucose tolerance
classes. People with diabetes were older than those with
normal glucose tolerance, had higher blood pressure and
more hypertension, were less physically active, more likely
to have a history of CVD and had higher BMI and WHR.
People with diabetes were also less educated, largely due
to the higher prevalence of southern European migrants.
Mortality rates increased with worsening glucose tolerance.
Hazard ratios for total and CVD mortality for diabetes
compared with normal glucose tolerance were elevated for
men and women (Table 2). These associations were atten-
uated after multivariate adjustment. In the unadjusted
model, known diabetes was associated with around
a twofold increase in CVD mortality for men and a threefold
increase for women. The mortality risk associated with new

diabetes was less than for previously diagnosed diabetes.
Because of the smaller number of CVD deaths, the HRs for
CVD mortality associated with new diabetes were not
statistically signiﬁcant after multivariate adjustment,
although the HRs were not smaller than those for total
mortality. The increase in risk of total and CVD mortality
across glucose tolerance categories was steeper for women
than for men (p interaction in model 1 Z 0.02 for total and
0.06 for CVD mortality).

Table 3 shows the HRs for unit increments in MDS for
total and CVD mortality in men and women. There was very
little difference in the HRs whether people with known
diabetes at baseline were excluded or not, and no evidence
that the association between MDS and either outcome
was modiﬁed by glucose tolerance status. In each instance
there was a small reduction in mortality risk associated
with increasing adherence to a Mediterranean diet.

Across all glucose tolerance groups except IGT in men,
and across all groups in women, an MDS above the median
of 5, was associated with slightly lower total mortality
(data not shown). A trend for lower CVD mortality in those
adhering more closely to the Mediterranean diet was
consistently seen across all glucose tolerance categories
except IGT in men but only in the women with normal
glucose tolerance or newly identiﬁed diabetes (Fig. 1).
However, 95% conﬁdence intervals associated with these
mortality rates were wide and overlapping.

MDS classiﬁed as: 0-2, 3-5, and 6-9, was positively asso-
ciated with absolute intakes of energy and fat, although the
percentage of energy from total fat and all fat sub-groups
fell with increasing MDS due to the greater proportional
increase in energy than fat. The reduced contribution of fat
to energy was balanced by an increase in the contribution
from carbohydrate. Glycemic load and ﬁbre intake increased
across MDS categories, although glycemic index decreased
slightly. The absolute intakes of n-6 and n-3 fats (including
long-chain) increased, but the n-6/n-3 ratio fell with
increasing MDS. Cholesterol intake increased slightly across
Mediterranean diet categories (Supplementary Table a).
All these associations were highly signiﬁcant (p < 0.001, by
oneway ANOVA).

variables included in the full model, except blood pressure,
family history of CVD and glucose tolerance, with MDS
(Supplementary Table b), although the actual differences
in risk levels across categories were generally small. The
proportion of smokers decreased from 19.2% for a score
of 0e2, to 8.1% for a score of 6e9, the proportion of
women from 64.5% to 55.5%, and the proportion of southern
European migrants increased from 12.9% to 36.9%.

Our hypothesis that the elevated mortality associated with
diabetes could be reduced by a more Mediterranean style-
diet was supported to some extent by our data. Overall,
a higher MDS was associated with reduced total and CVD

mortality, but this beneﬁt was not speciﬁc to people with
diabetes. However, if southern European migrants consumed
a more Mediterranean diet than Australian born, as we have
reported, this could contribute to their relatively lower risk
of total and CVD mortality.

A limitation of our study is the absence of data on some
potentially important CVD risk factors, most notably HDL-
cholesterol and triglycerides. Additional adjustment for
these factors may have explained more of the increased
mortality observed in people with diabetes. Risk factors
were only measured at baseline and people identiﬁed with
diabetes at baseline were advised to follow-up with their
doctors; as a result they may have changed their diet since
the baseline measurement. We did not ask people who
reported having diabetes at baseline to specify whether it
was type 1 or type 2, but we assume that it was predomi-
nantly type 2. In the 2004-05 National Health Survey, 83%
of people with self-reported diabetes said they had type 2
[14], and we would expect at least this proportion. Baseline
glucose tolerance for people without a previous diagnosis
of diabetes was based on a single glucose measurement,
66% of which were reportedly in the fasting state, but
misclassiﬁcation of glucose tolerance would be unlikely to
explain our observations.

The method of calculating the MDS, whereby points are
attributed for eating above the median for 6 out of 9 food
groups used to compute the score, tends to result in the score
being correlated with total intake (kJ), as we observed.
However, we also found differences in dietary composition
with increasing MDS. Using population speciﬁc medians to
deﬁne the MDS means high scoring individuals in non-Medi-
terranean populations may not be closely following the
traditional Cretan, Mediterranean diet on which the score
was based. However, our cohort included 25% of people of
Mediterranean origin, the frequencies for intakes of vege-
tables, fruit, ﬁsh and legumes in the top MDS group were high
and the proportion of southern European migrants roughly
doubled from the low MDS group to the high MDS group.

It should also be noted that while the total mortality
data are likely to be reliable, with only 0.2% loss to follow-
up; CVD mortality based on death certiﬁcates maybe under-
estimated relative to adjudicated causes of death; in the
MCCS the sensitivity of death register versus adjudication
was 85.9% (Harriss pers comm.). It is possible that the
degree of misclassiﬁcation varies depending on the pres-
ence or absence of diabetes, but we do not have any data
with which to assess this.

A strength of our study is that we were able to differ-
entiate between people with newly identiﬁed diabetes and
those with previously known diabetes. Participants with
previously identiﬁed diabetes could have changed their diet
(or their reported diet) as a result of their diagnosis,
complicating the analysis if they were included. As it turned
out we did not ﬁnd any evidence that including people with
known diabetes altered our results. Most studies looking at
Mediterranean diets have not differentiated between dia-
betes and non-diabetes [5].

A 2006 meta-analysis including 37 prospective cohort
studies reported a relative risk for fatal coronary heart
disease (CHD) for women with diabetes of 3.12 (95%CI
2.34e4.17) and for men 1.99 (1.69e2.35), with signiﬁcant
heterogeneity between sexes [15]. This is similar to our

results for the known diabetes sub-group, suggesting the
associations between diabetes and CVD in our cohort are
consistent with other studies.

The MDS was inversely associated with both total and CVD
mortality over all glucose tolerance categories. Previous
studies of people with type 2 diabetes have shown beneﬁts
of replacing saturated fat with MUFA; a 1998 meta-analysis
of 10 randomized cross-over trials showed that a MUFA rich
diet improved lipid proﬁles, glycaemic control, when
compared with a high carbohydrate diet, when energy intake
was controlled [16]. A 2003 review of out-patient studies
with food based diets found that a high MUFA diet was at
least as good as a high carbohydrate diet for diabetes, and
possibly more palatable [17]. Recent studies have conﬁrmed
metabolic beneﬁts of MUFA instead of high carbohydrate
for insulin resistance [18e20].

A Mediterranean diet is however, more than just MUFA.
Our current data show that people with a higher MDS
consumed more ﬁbre and had higher proportional intake
of n-3 fatty acids, both total and long chain, and lower
proportional n-6 intake, as well as consuming more fruit
and vegetables and less saturated fat.

A Mediterranean diet intervention in people with the
Metabolic Syndrome improved inﬂammatory markers and
endothelial function over 2 years [21,22]. In a 4 month study,
an increase in MDS from 3.2 to 5.4 was associated with
reductions in estimated CVD risk of around 30%, and indi-
vidually with improvements in lipids, blood pressure, CRP,
ﬁbrinogen and PAI-1 activity [23]. In the PREDIMED study,
both Mediterranean diet groups showed improvements in
dyslipidaemia compared with the low fat group [22] but we
could not assess this in the MCCS. In the Mediterranean
diet intervention of Esposito et al. [21] the n-6:n-3 ratio
was reduced from 11:1 to 7:1. Our MDS was associated
with slightly higher intakes of long chain n-3 PUFA and
a lower n-6:n-3 ratio. There are many possible mechanisms
by which n-3 fats can reduce CVD risk: increased heart rate
variability [24]; modiﬁed lipid and lipoprotein metabolism,
platelet function, arterial cholesterol delivery via modiﬁ-
cation of lipoprotein lipase expression, vascular function
and inﬂammatory responses [25]. A recent study found that
a Mediterranean diet in newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes,
was associated with a delayed need for anti-hyperglycemic
drugs [26], and we have reported that in people with type 2
diabetes, a Mediterranean diet consumed ad-libitum, with
most food supplied, reduced HbA1c from 7.1% to 6.8% [27].
A series of reports from the Nurse’s Health Study has
shown that in women with type 2 diabetes, moderate
alcohol intake, consumption of ﬁsh and omega-3 fats, as
well as bran were associated with reduced coronary heart
disease mortality [28e30]. These items may be associated
with a Mediterranean diet; hence the ﬁndings support
a beneﬁt of a Mediterranean dietary pattern in diabetes.

We have shown that the increase in mortality, especially
from CVD, associated with worsening glucose tolerance is
not explained by conventional risk factors, and that a more
Mediterranean style diet may be beneﬁcial. The Mediter-
ranean diet includes foods that are recommended sepa-
rately for medical nutrition therapy for diabetes, and is
associated with reduced total and CVD mortality. There is
a good case for recommending a Mediterranean style diet
for all, including people with type 2 diabetes.
