BSTRACT
Background
The effect of increasing the intake of
dietary fiber on glycemic control in patients with type
2 diabetes mellitus is controversial.
Methods
In a randomized, crossover study, we as-
signed 13  patients  with  type  2  diabetes  mellitus  to
follow two diets, each for six weeks: a diet containing
moderate amounts of fiber (total, 24 g; 8 g of soluble
fiber and 16 g of insoluble fiber), as recommended by
the American Diabetes Association (ADA), and a high-
fiber diet (total, 50 g; 25 g of soluble fiber and 25 g
of insoluble fiber) containing foods not fortified with
fiber (unfortified foods). Both diets, prepared in a re-
search kitchen, had the same macronutrient and en-
ergy content. We compared the effects of the two diets
on glycemic control and plasma lipid concentrations.
Results
Compliance with the diets was excellent.
During the sixth week of the high-fiber diet, as com-
pared with the sixth week of the ADA diet, mean dai-
ly preprandial plasma glucose concentrations were 13
mg  per  deciliter  (0.7  mmol  per  liter)  lower  (95  per-
cent confidence interval, 1 to 24 mg per deciliter [0.1
to 1.3  mmol  per  liter];  P=0.04)  and  mean  daily  uri-
nary glucose excretion was 1.3 g lower (median dif-
ference, 0.23 g; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.03
to 1.83; P=0.008). The high-fiber diet also lowered the
area under the curve for 24-hour plasma glucose and
insulin  concentrations,  which  were  measured  every
two  hours,  by  10  percent  (P=0.02)  and  12  percent
(P=0.05),  respectively.  The  high-fiber  diet  reduced
plasma  total  cholesterol  concentrations  by  6.7  per-
cent  (P=0.02),  triglyceride  concentrations  by  10.2
percent  (P=0.02),  and  very-low-density  lipoprotein
cholesterol concentrations by 12.5 percent (P=0.01).
Conclusions
A high intake of dietary fiber, partic-
ularly of the soluble type, above the level recommend-
ed by the ADA, improves glycemic control, decreases
hyperinsulinemia,  and  lowers  plasma  lipid  concen-
trations  in  patients  with  type  2  diabetes.  (N  Engl  J
Med 2000;342:1392-8.)

IETARY guidelines for patients with dia-
betes mellitus were revised by the Amer-
ican  Diabetes  Association  (ADA)  earlier
this year.
 The ADA recommends that the
1
composition of the diet be individualized on the basis
of a nutritional assessment and the outcomes desired.
Consistent  with  the  previous  recommendations  of
 the new guidelines advise replacing satu-

previous studies,
 an alternative approach of replac-
ing  saturated  fat  with  cis  monounsaturated  fat  was
also included in the recommendations.
 This new ap-

proach is further supported by epidemiologic studies
that have shown the healthful effects of diets rich in cis
monounsaturated fat in Mediterranean countries.

Another, less strongly emphasized aspect of Med-
iterranean diets is the high intake of fruits, vegetables,
and grains that are rich sources of dietary fiber.
13,14
The ADA recommended a moderate increase in the
intake of dietary fiber to 20 to 35 g per day because
of  the  cholesterol-lowering  effects  of  soluble  fiber.
However, the effects of dietary fiber on glycemic con-
trol were considered inconsequential.
 Furthermore,

the expert panel of the ADA considered it difficult
to achieve a high dietary intake of soluble fiber with-
out consuming foods or supplements fortified with

termine the effects on glycemic control and plasma
lipid concentrations of increasing the intake of die-
tary fiber in patients with type 2 diabetes exclusively
through the consumption of foods not fortified with
fiber (unfortified foods) to a level beyond that rec-
ommended by the ADA. In addition, we studied the
effects of such an intervention on the intestinal ab-
sorption of cholesterol and the fecal excretion of ster-
ols in an attempt to uncover the mechanisms by which
a high-fiber diet lowers plasma cholesterol.

METHODS

Patients

We studied 12 men and 1 woman (9 non-Hispanic whites and
4 blacks) with type 2 diabetes at the general clinical research center
of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas.
The protocol for the study was approved by the institutional re-
view board of the medical center, and each patient gave written
informed consent. In all patients the onset of diabetes was insid-
ious; the disease developed in most of the patients after 40 years
of age. Their mean (±SD) age was 61±9 years (range, 45 to 70).
Their mean body weight was 93.5±12.7 kg, and the mean body-
mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the
height in meters) was 32.3±3.9. Three patients were treated with
diet alone, and the other 10 patients were treated with 2.5 to 20

mg of glyburide daily in addition to diet. The dose of glyburide
was not changed during the study.

On entry into the study, the patients’ plasma cholesterol and tri-
glyceride concentrations after an overnight fast ranged from 151
to 324 mg per deciliter (3.90 to 8.38 mmol per liter) and 67 to
390 mg per deciliter (0.76 to 4.40 mmol per liter), respectively,
and  their  fasting  plasma  glucose  concentrations  were  less  than
200 mg per deciliter (11.1 mmol per liter). Their glycosylated he-
moglobin  values  ranged  from  6.0  to  9.8  percent.  Two  patients
had a history of coronary heart disease, but none had recently had
a  myocardial  infarction,  unstable  angina  pectoris,  or  congestive
heart failure. Also, none had thyroid, renal, or hepatic disease. None
of the patients were receiving lipid-lowering therapy.

Design of the Study

All  the  patients  were  first  admitted  to  the  general  clinical  re-
search center for five days (the base-line period), during which a
detailed history was taken, a physical examination was performed,
and laboratory tests were performed. After the base-line period, all
the patients received both the ADA diet and the high-fiber diet,
each diet for a period of six weeks. Six patients received the high-
fiber diet first, and the other seven received the ADA diet first.
There was a median interval of seven days between the two study
periods, during which the patients were instructed to consume an
isocaloric diet. During the last week of each dietary period (days
36 to 42), the patients were hospitalized for evaluation.

On weekdays, all the patients ate at least one meal (breakfast,
lunch, or dinner) at the general clinical research center. Other meals
were supplied in packages so that they could be consumed at home.
The dietitian monitored compliance by interviewing the patients.
The patients were instructed to bring back any unconsumed food
and to maintain a constant level of physical activity throughout the
study.

Blood for lipid analyses was drawn, after an overnight fast, daily
for two days before the institution of the study diet and daily on
days 38 through 42 during both dietary periods. Plasma glucose
was measured at 7 and 11 a.m. and at 4 and 8 p.m. each day dur-
ing the base-line period and on days 38 through 42 of both die-
tary periods. Glycosylated hemoglobin was measured during the
base-line  period  and  at  the  end  of  each  dietary  period.  On  the
last day of each dietary period, blood samples were obtained ev-
ery two hours for measurements of plasma glucose and insulin.
On days 38 through 42, patients collected 24-hour urine speci-
mens for quantitative determination of glucose.

To permit us to determine fecal sterol balance and the percentage
of cholesterol absorption, each patient took a capsule containing
30 mg of sitostanol, 3 mg of [26,26,26,27,27,27-
]-cholesterol,

and 3 mg of [5,6,22,23-

N.H.)  three  times  a  day  on  days  36  through  42.  Fecal  samples
were collected on day 35 or 36 and on the last three days of each
dietary period. Fecal samples were frozen within 12 hours after
collection and were pooled for analysis of small aliquots.

foods.  The  patients  were  allowed  some  choices  of  food  items.
Both diets provided 15 percent of the total energy as protein, 55
percent as carbohydrate, and 30 percent as fat; saturated, cis mono-
unsaturated, and polyunsaturated fats accounted for 7 percent, 17
percent, and 6 percent of the total energy, respectively.

The high-fiber diet provided 50 g of total fiber per day; soluble
and  insoluble  fiber  content  provided  25  g  each.  The  ADA  diet
contained 24 g of total fiber per day, with 8 g as soluble fiber and
16 g as insoluble fiber. Unfortified foods, particularly those rich

in soluble fiber, such as cantaloupe, grapefruit, orange, papaya, rai-
sins, lima beans, okra, sweet potato, winter squash, zucchini, gra-
nola, oat bran, and oatmeal, were used to achieve high-fiber intake.
No fiber supplements were used. Sample menus of both the study
diets  are  shown  in  Table  2.  The  individual  foods  were  weighed
daily during meal preparation in the research kitchen of the gen-
eral clinical research center.

Biochemical Analyses

17

Fasting plasma total cholesterol, lipoprotein cholesterol, and tri-
glycerides were measured according to the procedures of the Lip-
id Research Clinics.
 Cholesterol and triglycerides were measured
enzymatically with the use of kits (Boehringer Mannheim, Indi-
anapolis).  Very-low-density  lipoproteins  (VLDLs)  (density,  less
than 1.006 g per milliliter) were removed by ultracentrifugation,
and cholesterol was measured in the VLDL fraction and the in-
franatant. High-density-lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol was meas-
ured enzymatically after lipoproteins containing apolipoprotein B
had  been  precipitated  with  heparin–manganese.  Cholesterol  in
the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) fraction was estimated to be
the difference between the cholesterol content of the infranatant
and that of the HDL fraction.

Plasma and urinary glucose were measured by the glucose ox-
idase method (Beckman Glucose Analyzer, Beckman Instruments,
Fullerton,  Calif.).  Glycosylated  hemoglobin  was  measured  with
ion-exchange high-performance liquid chromatography (Bio-Rad
Laboratories,  Hercules,  Calif.).  Plasma  insulin  was  measured  by
radioimmunoassay.

Pooled fecal samples collected within the last week of each die-
tary period were prepared for analysis of neutral and acidic fecal
sterols  as  described  previously.
  Gas–liquid  chromatography  of
neutral and acidic fecal sterols was performed on a gas chromato-
graph  (model  HP5890,  Hewlett–Packard,  Palo  Alto,  Calif.)
equipped with an automatic sample injector. Cholesterol absorp-
tion was measured during the same period from fecal samples by
gas–liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry.

Statistical Analysis

To compare the two study periods and to assess the effect of
the  sequence  in  which  the  patients  received  the  high-fiber  and

ADA diets, we used repeated-measures analysis of variance.
 For
skewed data, we used the Wilcoxon signed-rank test to compare
the two dietary periods.

23

RESULTS

The compliance with both the study diets was ex-
cellent, according to interviews with the patients and
estimates of the energy content of any leftover foods.
Three  patients  reported  consuming  extra  food  on
one day during the study, two while eating the high-
fiber diet and one the ADA diet. The patients com-
mented  about  the  larger  quantities  of  food  in  the
high-fiber diet, but they consumed all the food giv-
en to them. The results are presented irrespective of
the order of the diets, because the sequence of the
diets had no effect on the results.

During the last week of each study period, the pa-
tients in both groups had similar daily energy intakes
and body weights and received a similar dose of gly-
buride (Table 3). The mean plasma glucose concen-
tration was lower (by 13 mg per deciliter [0.7 mmol
per liter], or 8.9 percent) when patients completed
the  high-fiber  diet  than  when  they  completed  the
ADA diet (P=0.04), and mean daily urinary glucose
excretion was 1.3 g lower (P=0.008). Daily plasma
glucose concentrations were 10 percent lower with
the high-fiber diet than with the ADA diet (values
for the area under the curve, 3743±944 vs. 3365±
1003 mg·hour per deciliter [207.8±52.4 vs. 186.8±
55.7 mmol·hour per liter]; P=0.02), and plasma in-
sulin  concentrations  were 12  percent  lower  (values
for  the  area  under  the  curve, 1107±650  vs.  971±
491 µU·hour per milliliter [6642±3900 vs. 5826±

cosylated hemoglobin values were slightly lower af-
ter the high-fiber diet (P=0.09).

As  compared  with  the  ADA  diet,  the  high-fiber
diet resulted in a lower fasting plasma total cholester-
ol concentration (by 6.7 percent, P=0.02), a lower
plasma triglyceride concentration (by 10.2 percent,
P=0.02), and a lower plasma VLDL cholesterol con-
centration (by 12.5 percent, P=0.01) (Table 4). The
fasting  plasma  LDL  cholesterol  concentration  was
6.3 percent lower with the high-fiber diet (P=0.11).
There  were  no  significant  differences  between  the

two diets in terms of the fasting plasma HDL cho-
lesterol concentration.

As  compared  with  the  ADA  diet,  the  high-fiber
diet decreased gastrointestinal absorption of choles-
terol by 10 percent (48.5±9.6 vs. 43.7±7.4 percent;
95 percent confidence interval for the decrease, 0.6

the increase, 137 to 589 mg per day; P=0.005), but

DISCUSSION

The intake of dietary fiber among people living in
Western countries remains low, and according to the
Third  National  Health  and  Nutrition  Examination
Survey (NHANES), it averages 17 g per day in the
United States.
 Although patients with diabetes are
advised  to  increase  their  intake  of  dietary  fiber,  in
the  NHANES  study,  their  average  daily  intake  was
found to be only 16 g.
 Why the intake of dietary
fiber in patients with diabetes remains low — despite
its well-documented effect of lowering plasma cho-
lesterol concentrations — remains unexplained. It is
possible  that  the  controversy  about  whether  there
are beneficial effects of dietary fiber on glycemic con-
trol reduces the enthusiasm of physicians and dieti-
tians for recommending high-fiber diets. The main
purpose  of  our  study  was  to  investigate  the  effects
on glycemic control of increasing the intake of die-
tary fiber. To avoid the confounding effects of con-
comitant changes in energy and macronutrients, the
two study diets were isocaloric and the macronutri-
ent composition of the diets was identical. Further-
more, unfortified foods were used as the source of
dietary fiber.

Most important, we found that the high-fiber diet
improved glycemic control, as evidenced by decreases
in  the  mean  daily  preprandial  and  24-hour  plasma
glucose  concentrations.  Urinary  glucose  excretion
was  also  lowered  by  the  high-fiber  diet.  The  high-
fiber  diet  lowered  glycosylated  hemoglobin  values
slightly but not significantly. The high-fiber diet also
lowered 24-hour plasma insulin concentrations.

 and in that by Simpson et al.,

The results of previous studies that evaluated the
role of dietary fiber on glycemic control in patients
with type 2 diabetes were inconsistent. In some of the
studies, the lack of control for concomitant changes
in the intake of macronutrients makes the data diffi-
cult to interpret. For example, in the study by Kiehm
et al.
 the high-fiber
diet had a lower fat and higher carbohydrate content
than the low-fiber diet. In other studies, the inter-
pretation of the results was confounded by the short
duration of the dietary intervention,
 the lack of
random assignment of the sequence of the high-fiber
and low-fiber diets,
 and unexplained weight loss
during the high-fiber diet.

 or resulted in only a slight improvement.

Only a few well-controlled studies have evaluated
the glycemic effects of increasing the intake of die-
tary fiber with the use of either preparations of re-
fined concentrated fiber or unfortified food, and the
results have been inconsistent.
 For example, diets
that included 15 to 21 g of guar-gum fiber or oat-bran
concentrate per day had no effect on glycemic con-
trol
33,34
In randomized, crossover trials of six weeks’ duration
in which the intake of dietary fiber was increased by
16  g  per  1000  kcal  through  the  consumption  of
foods prepared in a research kitchen or by 14 g per
day  through  dietary  instruction,  there  was  no  im-
provement  in  glycemic  control.
  In  contrast,  in-
creasing dietary fiber by 23 g for three weeks and by
30 g for six weeks resulted in decreased fasting and
postprandial  plasma  glucose  concentrations.
  We
found that an increase in the intake of total dietary
fiber,  which  consisted  predominantly  of  soluble  fi-
ber, significantly improved glycemic control and de-
creased  the  degree  of  hyperinsulinemia  in  patients
with type 2 diabetes.

Our  study  also  demonstrates  the  feasibility  of
achieving a high intake of dietary soluble fiber by con-
suming unfortified foods. Our patients accepted the
high-fiber diet well and had few side effects; there-
fore, we recommend that patients with diabetes be
encouraged to  use unfortified foods instead  of  less
palatable purified-fiber preparations and supplements
to increase their intake of dietary fiber.

The  mechanisms  of  the  improved  glycemic  con-
trol associated with high fiber intake remain unde-
fined.  Whether  this  effect  is  due  to  an  increase  in
soluble fiber, insoluble fiber, or both is unclear. Be-

ever, in our study, the patients’ weight did not change
with the high-fiber diet, which suggests that the de-
gree of reduction in the absorption of fat was insig-
nificant. Another possibility is that dietary fiber im-
proves glycemic control by reducing or delaying the
absorption of carbohydrates.

As  expected,  the  high-fiber  diet  reduced  plasma
total  cholesterol  concentrations  by  6.7  percent,  a

finding consistent with the results of previous reports
of the cholesterol-reducing effects of soluble but not
insoluble  fiber.40,41  Therefore,  the  lowering  of  cho-
lesterol can be attributed primarily to an average in-
crease of 17 g in the intake of soluble fiber. Previous
studies in normal subjects have reported no effects
of the amount of dietary fiber on plasma triglyceride
concentrations.42 In our study, the decrease in plas-
ma triglyceride and VLDL cholesterol concentrations
during  the  high-fiber  diet  could  have  been  due  to
the improvement in glycemic control.

The mechanisms of the reduction in plasma cho-
lesterol concentrations induced by the increased di-
etary fiber intake are controversial, however. The in-
crease in bile-acid excretion probably explains most of
the reduction, and the reduction in cholesterol ab-
sorption may also have contributed to this finding.
Previous studies have also reported a variable increase
in  bile-acid  excretion  resulting  from  the  consump-
tion of pectin,39,43 oat bran,44,45 bagasse,46 and diets
with a mixture of soluble fiber and insoluble fiber,47
but not psyllium.48 In contrast, Kesaniemi et al.47 re-
ported that a high-fiber diet did not change choles-
terol  absorption  in  normal  subjects.  However,  the
high-fiber diet they used included 26 g of fiber, and
it did not lower plasma cholesterol concentrations.47 
In conclusion, an increase in the intake of dietary
fiber, predominantly of the soluble type, by patients
with type 2 diabetes mellitus improved glycemic con-
trol  and  decreased  hyperinsulinemia  in  addition  to
the expected lowering of plasma lipid concentrations.
Therefore, dietary guidelines for patients with diabe-
tes should emphasize an overall increase in dietary fi-
ber through the consumption of unfortified foods,
rather than the use of fiber supplements.
