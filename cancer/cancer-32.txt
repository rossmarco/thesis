In the present study, we examined the ability of chymostatin,
a  highly  specific  inhibitor  of  chymotrypsin,  to  suppress
dimethylhydrazine-induced  colon  carcinogenesis,  and  the
dose-response  relationship  for  an  extract  of  soybeans
containing  the  Bowman -Birk  inhibitor  (BBI)  to  suppress
dimethylhydrazine-induced  colon carcinogenesis, when added
to  the  diet  of  mice.  Our  results  showed  that:  (i)  diets
containing  0.1%  BBI  reduced  the  incidence  of  adeno-
carcinomas  of  the  colon  - 5 0 %,  but  had  no  effect  on  the
incidence  of  squamous  cell  carcinomas  of  the  anal  gland;
(ii) the suppressive effect  requires protease inhibitor  activity,
as the autoclaved BBI, in which all protease inhibitory activity
has  been  destroyed,  was  ineffective  at  suppressing  the
incidence  of  adenocarcinomas;  (iii) chymostatin  suppressed
the incidence of squamous cell carcinomas of the anal  gland,
but  not  adenocarcinomas  of  the  colon;  and  (iv) the  growth
rates of the animals were the same in each of the experimental
groups. Our  results indicate that the levels of anticarcinogenic
protease  inhibitors  present  in  the  diets  of  these  animals  do
not have any adverse effects  on the growth or  general  health
of  the  animals.

Introduction
Cancer  of the colon  and  rectum  is the second  leading  cause of
cancer death  in US adults (1).  In the United  States,  ~  130 000
new cases of colon cancer are reported each year and colon cancer
accounts  for  about  60 000 deaths  annually.  The  incidence  and
mortality rates of colon cancer have remained unchanged for the
last 50 years (1,2). Since colon cancer has been largely  refractory
to contemporary treatment regimens (2), an alternative approach
to  controlling  this  disease  is  through  prevention.  Cancer
prevention via dietary means may well be the most  cost-effective
approach  towards  controlling  this  disease.

Epidemiological  data  suggest  that  nutritional  factors  play  a
major role in the etiology of cancer at many different  sites (3-7).
For example, high dietary levels of legumes have been associated
with low cancer rates in general and are inversely correlated with
the  incidences  of  breast,  colon  and  prostate  cancer  (3,6,7).
Legumes are  known  to contain  high concentrations  of  protease
inhibitors (8), as well as other agents (such as lectins, etc.) which
may  modify  carcinogenesis.  Protease  inhibitors  have  been
shown  to  have  anticarcinogenic  activity  in  vivo  and  in  vitro
(e.g.  9-22).  We  have  reported  that  the  soybean-derived
Bowman-Birk  inhibitor  (BBI*)  (8,23)  suppresses  dimethyl-
hydrazine (DMH)-induced colon and liver carcinogenesis in mice,
when  present  in  the diet  (17,20),  7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthra-

cene-induced  cheek  pouch  carcinogenesis  in  hamsters,  when
topically  applied  (16),  and  3-methylcholanthrene-induced  lung
tumorigenesis in mice (21). BBI has also been shown to suppress
carcinogen-induced  malignant  transformation  in  vitro (9,22).

In general,  inhibitors of chymotrypsin  have been  found  to be
the  most  effective  suppressors  of  transformation  in  vitro (15).
For example, nanomolar concentrations of chymostatin, a highly
specific  inhibitor  of  chymotrypsin  (24),  have  been  shown  to
inhibit  radiation-induced  transformation  of  C3H/10T1/2  cells
(14,15).  In  the  current  experiments,  we  have  continued  our
studies  examining  the  ability  of  the  BBI  to  suppress  colon
carcinogenesis and have also examined the effect  of chymostatin
on  colon  carcinogenesis.

Materials  and  methods
Chemicals
The  BBI was obtained  from  Central  Soya  (Fort Wayne,  IN) and  was prepared
as  described  (17).  Chymostatin  was  obtained  from  the  US/Japan  Cooperative
Cancer Research Program.  1,2-Dimethylhydrazine  dihydrochloride was obtained
from  Aldrich.  Stock  solutions of DMH were freshly  prepared  in  1  mM  EDTA
and  adjusted  to  pH  6.5  with  NaOH  before  each  set  of  injections.
Preparation of autoclaved  BBI  (ABBI) and  succinylated BBI (SBBI)
ABBI was prepared by autoclaving  BBI for  30 min.  SBBI was prepared  by the
method of Smirnoff  (25). Briefly,  BBI was dissolved  in distilled water (5 mg/ml)
and brought to pH 9 by the addition of  1  N NaOH. Succinic anhydride was added
(in a ratio of 0.5 g succinic anhydride/g BBI), the sample was stirred and maintained
at pH 8 -9  by the dropwise addition of  1  N NaOH. After 2 h, additional succinic
anhydride was added  and the reaction  was allowed  to proceed  for  an additional
2 h.  Next, the pH was adjusted  to 3.5  by the addition  of concentrated  HC1, the
sample was centrifuged  (10 000 g  x  30 min, 4°C), and the pellet was resuspended
in distilled water, dialyzed against distilled  water (three changes, overnight) and
lyophilized to dryness. The modified  (succinylated) BBI was assayed for its ability
to inhibit chymotrypsin and trypsin; chymotrypsin  inhibitory activity was present
while  >99%  of  the  trypsin  inhibitory  activity  of  BBI  was  lost.
Animals
Eight  week  old  male  CD-I  mice  were  obtained  from  Charles  River  Breeding
Laboratories (Wilmington, MA), and upon arrival in the laboratory were randomly
assorted  into treatment  groups,  housed  three  mice  per  cage  and  placed  on  the
experimental  diets.  The  animals  were  maintained  in  a  controlled  environment
animal facility at 25°C with a  12 h light/dark cycle, and received  food and water
ad  libitum. The  mice  were  fed  a  modification  of diet  no.  101  from  Bio  Serve
(Frenchtown, NJ), a methionine-supplemented  diet based on guidelines from the
American Institute of Nutrition for a purified diet for rats and mice (26). Animals
receiving  protease  inhibitor  supplements  also  received  diet  no.  101  with  20%
dietary protein, with the protease inhibitor supplement replacing various percentages
of the casein component of the diet. All animals were weighed at weekly intervals
and received  weekly  i.p.  injections  of  DMH. The DMH  injections began when
the mice were  10 weeks old, after  a 2 week adaptation to the experimental diets
and continued for 20 weeks. The animals were killed by cervical extension.  For
histopathological  analysis, any macroscopically  abnormal organs, as well as the
colon and pancreas, were removed from each mouse. The pancreas was weighed
and examined  for  grossly  observable tumors or other abnormalities.  The entire
colon  was examined  and  the  distance  between  the  anus  and  any  visible  tumor
was measured. The section of the colon containing the tumor was then excised.
In addition  to the abnormal  sections of the colon,  normal  appearing areas  from
each of the three major regions (representing the entire length of the colon) were
taken from each mouse for histopathologic analysis. These sections, the tumors,
pancreata  and  any  macroscopically  abnormal  tissues  were  preserved  in  10%
buffered  formalin and embedded in paraffin;  4 -5  /an thick sections were prepared
and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Benign and malignant colon tumors were
classified  as  described  (27).  Pathological  analysis  was  performed  without
knowledge  of  the  treatment  group  to  which  the  animals  belonged.

Results
The  current  studies  were designed  to determine  the ability  and
dose—response  relationship  of  various  preparations  of  BBI to
suppress DMH-induced colon carcinogenesis in mice. A second
objective of the study was to determine whether chymostatin has
the ability to suppress colon carcinogenesis. The mice were given
DMH  injections  while maintained  on diets containing:  (i) 0.1%
(1 part per  1000), 0.01 % (0.1 part per  1000) or 0.0005% (0.005
part  per  1000) of the BBI extract;  (ii) chymostatin,  a low  mol.
wt chymotrypsin  inhibitor  (24); and  (iii)  modified  preparations
containing  ABBI  (autoclaving  destroys  all  chymotrypsin  and
trypsin inhibitory activity) or SBBI [this BBI preparation has been
treated  with succinic anhydride, which  specifically  succinylates
a critical  lysine residue (Lysl6)  in the trypsin inhibitory portion
of  the  BBI  molecule.  This  covalent  modification  selectively
removes the trypsin inhibitory activity, leaving the chymotrypsin
inhibitory  activity  intact  (17,25)].  The  experimental  group
receiving  ABBI  also served  as an  isocaloric  diet  control  group
for the treatment groups receiving the various BBI preparations.
In  the  first  series  of  experiments,  DMH-induced  adeno-
carcinomas  in  the  colon  in  63%  of  the  animals;  0.1% BBI in
the  diet  significantly  reduced  the  incidence  of  these  tumors  in
the  DMH-treated  animals to 34.8%  (Table I). At 0.01 % of the
diet, BBI produced an insignificant  decrease in tumor incidence,
while dietary  levels of 0.0005%  BBI, 0.1 % ABBI, 0.1 % SBBI
or  0.1 % chymostatin  had  no  effect  on  the  induction  of adeno-
carcinomas  (Table  I).

Interestingly,  a  different  pattern  of  tumor  suppression  was
observed  when  we  compared  the  incidence  of  squamous  cell
carcinomas  of the anal gland  in animals  fed  the different  diets.
The BBI had no effect  on the incidence of anal  gland tumors in
these animals,  while  a suppressive  effect  on  these tumors was
observed  with a diet supplemented  with chymostatin  (Table II).
We performed  two additional  sets of experiments  to determine
the  effects  of  chymostatin  on  gastro-intestinal  tract  tumors.  In
these  studies,  DMH  injections  (15  mg/kg  in  experiment  1 and
20 mg/kg in experiment 2) were given for 20 weeks; the animals
were killed 6 months after the beginning of carcinogen  injections.
As two different  experiments  were performed  to determine the
effect  of chymostatin  on colon  carcinogenesis,  we analyzed out
data using the likelihood ratio chi-squared test (GLIM Statistical
Package,  Royal  Statistical  Society)  to  rule  out  the  effect  of
experimental  variation.  Using this analysis, we found  that there

these  studies  demonstrate  that  chymostatin  had  a  significant
suppressive effect  on DMH-induced  squamous cell  carcinomas
of  the  anal  gland  but  had  no effect  on  adenomatous  tumors of
the  colon  (Table  IH).

It has been  reported  that high  levels of protease  inhibitors in
the diet can lead to reduced growth rates, resulting from decreased
protein utilization, as well as pathologic changes in the pancreas
(28-30).  Consequently,  the  animals  were  weighed  at  weekly
intervals to assess their rate of growth; no difference  in the growth
rates for animals in any of the experimental groups was observed.
The  pancreata  from  the  animals  in each  group  were  dissected
out and weighed. No difference  in the ratio of pancreas wt/body
wt was observed between those animals on the control diet and
those receiving diets containing protease  inhibitor.  Further,  the
protease  inhibitor-containing  diets  had  no  effect  on  the  gross
appearance  or  histopathological  characteristics  of  the  pancreas
in  these  studies.

Discussion

In the present  study,  we have utilized  the DMH-induced  colon
carcinogenesis  model  to  study  the  inhibition  of  colon  carcino-
genesis in mice by dietary protesae inhibitors. Our results support
our  previous  findings  that  dietary  intake  of  BBI  will  suppress
adenomatous tumors of the colon (17,20). BBI was an  effective
anticarcinogenic agent when present at a concentration of 0.1 %,
while  lower  concentrations  of  the  inhibitor  were  less  effective
or ineffective  at reducing tumor  incidence. Consequently, these
studies, in addition to previous work (17), suggest that the 0.1 %
level  of the BBI extract  is the minimal  concentration  necessary
for a significant  reduction  in adenomatous tumors of the colon.
Lower  levels  of  dietary  BBI  are  still  effective  at  suppressing
tumors  at  other  sites;  however,  at  0.01% of  the diet,  the BBI
extract has been shown to suppress DMH-induced angiosarcomas
of the liver  (17).  It  should  be  noted  that  the levels  of  protease
inhibitors shown to be anticarcinogenic in our studies are roughly
comparable (on a mg/kg basis) to the estimated intake of protease
inhibitors  by  specific  human  populations  consuming  relatively
high  levels of dietary  protease  inhibitors,  such as the Japanese
and Seventh Day Adventists (17). These populations have been
shown to have lower than normal incidences of breast, colon and
prostate cancer (3-7);  it is possible that the low cancer incidence
in these populations could be, at least in part, attributable to their
dietary  intake  of  anticarcinogenic  protease  inhibitors.

The  inability  of  ABBI  to  suppress  the  formation  of  adeno-
carcinomas  provides  strong  evidence  that  protease  inhibitory
activity  is necessary  for  tumor  suppression.  We  also  observed
that SBBI had no effect  on colon carcinogenesis in these studies.
SBBI contains chymotrypsin  inhibitory  activity  but has had the
trypsin inhibitory activity of BBI selectively removed. A number
of different  explanations  are possible  for  our  results showing a
lack of suppression  of carcinogenesis by SBBI. Although  SBBI
still  retains the ability  to suppress  transformation  in vitro, it is
not known whether it has the same ability as BBI to pass through
the stomach  in an  intact  form  and  enter  the intestine  in a  form
capable of interacting  with proteases.  Even  if SBBI does reach
the intestine as an active protease  inhibitor,  it may not be taken
up by the colonic epithelial cells as efficiently  as BBI and, thus,
may not be able to interact with, and inhibit, the critical enzymes
in these  cells.  Additionally,  SBBI  may  be  more  water  soluble
than  the  native  inhibitor  and,  hence,  may  be  more  rapidly
excreted. Alternatively, the trypsin inhibitory portion of BBI may
play an important role in inhibiting adenomatous colonic tumors.

in  vitro  by 

tumor  promoters 

We  have  observed  previously  that  SBTI  (a  strong  inhibitor  of
trypsin)  does  not  directly  suppress  radiation  transformation  in
vitro,  but  will  suppress  the  enhancement  of  radiation-induced
transformation 
(12,13).
Consequently, while chymotrypsin inhibitors are likely to be the
most potent anticarcinogenic  agents, trypsin  inhibitors,  such as
SBTI,  may  also  have  cancer  chemopreventive  value  by  virtue
of their ability to inhibit the promotional phase of carcinogenesis.
Thus,  tumor  promotion  may  play  an  important  role  in  the
development of adenomatous tumors arising in the large bowel.
While  BBI  suppressed  the  incidence  of  adenocarcinomas  of
the colon, it did not affect  the incidence of anal gland squamous
cell  tumors.  In contrast,  chymostatin  suppressed  the  incidence
of squamous cell tumors in the anal gland, but had no effect  on
adenocarcinomas of the colon. Several factors could account for
these  results,  (i)  The  critical  target  enzymes  involved  in  the
malignant transformation  of the cells of the colon and anal gland
are  different.  Presumably,  BBI  would  be  a  more  effective
inhibitor  of  the  critical  target  enzymes  in  the  colon  while
chymostatin  is more effective  at inhibiting these enzymes in the
cells  lining  the  anal  gland,  (ii)  BBI  may  be  absorbed  more
efficiently  by the epithelial cells lining the colon while chymostatin
may  be more  effectively  absorbed  by the epithelial  cells  lining
the anal gland.  While BBI is water  soluble, chymostatin  is not,
and hence its distribution in the gastrointestinal tract contents may
not favor uptake by the critical epithelial cells lining the gut. The
fact that chymostatin is fat soluble could also explain its selective
ability to affect  anal gland carcinogenesis.  Consequently,  water
solubility may be an important characteristic of protease inhibitors
for  the  suppression  of  adenomatous  tumors  of  the  colon.

It  is  somewhat  surprising  to  us  that  BBI  does  not  affect
squamous cell carcinomas of the anal gland, as it has previously
been shown to suppress squamous cell carcinomas of the hamster
cheek pouch (16). As discussed elsewhere (17), the cells of origin
of  squamous cell carcinomas are markedly  different  in the oral
and  anal  gland  epithelium,  which  perhaps  accounts  for  the
observed differences  in the ability of BBI to affect  carcinogenesis
at  these  two  sites.

The  ability  of  protease  inhibitors  to  suppress  carcinogenesis
appears to vary greatly with the dose of carcinogen  administered.
BBI  has  previously  been  shown 
to  prevent  completely
adenomatous tumors of the gastrointestinal tract when the doses
of DMH utilized were such that a considerably  lower percentage
of  the  animals  developed  tumors  than  observed  in  the  present
study (17,20). We observed that BBI was capable of suppressing

the yield of tumors, in terms of tumor-bearing animals, by  —1/2
in this study,  which  utilized a high carcinogen  dose resulting in
gastrointestinal tract tumors in most of the DMH-treated animals.
Chemopreventive  agents  appear  to act  similarly  in other  organ
systems as well, with the degree of suppression of tumorigenici-
ty  being  inversely  correlated  with  the  tumor  yield  (15).

The results from  this study support our previous findings  that
non-toxic levels of BBI can suppress the development of murine
adenomatous colon tumors, which are histopathologically  similar
to those  that  occur  in  the  most  common  form  of  human  colon
cancer.  Indeed,  the  colon  cancer  model  utilized  in the  present
studies is considered to be a representative model  for the human
disease  (31).  Thus,  BBI  may  have  the  potential  to  lower  the
incidence  of  colon  cancer  in  the  human  population.
