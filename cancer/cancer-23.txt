Low plasma B-vitamin levels and elevated homocysteine have been associated with cancer, cardiovascular
disease and neurodegenerative disorders. Common variants in FUT2 on chromosome 19q13 were associated
with plasma vitamin B12 levels among women in a genome-wide association study in the Nurses’ Health
Study (NHS) NCI-Cancer Genetic Markers of Susceptibility (CGEMS) project. To identify additional loci
associated with plasma vitamin B12, homocysteine, folate and vitamin B6 (active form pyridoxal 50-phosphate,
PLP), we conducted a meta-analysis of three GWA scans (total n 5 4763, consisting of 1658 women in NHS-
CGEMS, 1647 women in Framingham-SNP-Health Association Resource (SHARe) and 1458 men in SHARe).
On chromosome 19q13, we conﬁrm the association of plasma vitamin B12 with rs602662 and rs492602 (P-
value 5 1.83 3 10215 and 1.30 3 10214, respectively) in strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) with rs601338
(P 5 6.92 3 10215), the FUT2 W143X nonsense mutation. We identiﬁed additional genome-wide signiﬁcant
loci for plasma vitamin B12 on chromosomes 6p21 (P 5 4.05 3 10208), 10p12 (P-value52.87 3 1029) and
11q11 (P-value52.25 3 10210) in genes with biological relevance. We conﬁrm the association of the well-
studied functional candidate SNP 5,10-methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) Ala222Val (dbSNP
ID: rs1801133; P-value51.27 3 1028), on chromosome 1p36 with plasma homocysteine and identify an
additional genome-wide signiﬁcant locus on chromosome 9q22 (P-value52.06 3 1028) associated with
plasma homocysteine. We also identiﬁed genome-wide associations with variants on chromosome 1p36
with plasma PLP (P-value51.40 3 10215). Genome-wide signiﬁcant loci were not identiﬁed for plasma
folate. These data reveal new biological candidates and conﬁrm prior candidate genes for plasma homocys-
teine, plasma vitamin B12 and plasma PLP.

INTRODUCTION

One-carbon metabolism comprises a network of biochemical
reactions involved in the transfer of single-carbon moieties
essential for purine and thymidylate synthesis necessary for
maintenance of genomic integrity and remethylation of homo-
cysteine for S-adenosylmethionine (SAM)-dependent DNA

methylation reactions (1,2). Folate, a B-complex nutrient
from diet and supplements, donates methyl groups to generate
methionine from homocysteine. Plasma homocysteine (Hcy),
an integrated marker of one-carbon metabolism, is inversely
related to folate, vitamin B6 (3) and vitamin B12 and positively
related to high alcohol consumption (4,5). Vitamin B12 is a
necessary co-factor for the methionine synthase catalyzed

remethylation of Hcy into methionine. The biologically active
form of vitamin B6, pyridoxal 50-phosphate (PLP), catalyzes
Hcy transulfuration (6) and is involved in over 100 enzyme
reactions in the synthesis and catabolism of neurotransmitters
(7), amino acids, glycogen and lipids (8).

Epidemiologic studies have shown that

individuals with
reduced intake of
folate (found in fruits, vegetables and
legumes) or vitamin B6 (found in poultry, ﬁsh, meat, legumes,
nuts and potatoes) or vitamin B12 [found in liver, shellﬁsh, ﬁsh,
poultry, eggs and dairy products (9)] have an inverse relationship
with Hcy levels. The accumulation of Hcy leads to an intracellular
increase in S-adenosylhomocysteine (AdoHcy) and is an estab-
lished risk predictor of cardiovascular diseases (6,10– 16). In
addition,
individuals with inadequate intake of folate and
vitamin B12 are at an elevated risk of uracil misincorporation
into DNA and aberrant DNA methylation (17–20). Vitamin
B12 deﬁciency (21), related to poor intestinal B12 absorption (9)
or dietary deﬁciency, can lead to inactivation of methionine
synthase and is associated with pernicious anemia (22), cardio-
vascular disease (23– 25), cancer (26–32) and neurodegenerative
disorders (5,33–35). Plasma PLP levels are signiﬁcantly inver-
sely associated with risk of colorectal cancer in men (36) and
women (37).

Plasma Hcy is the integrated marker of the one-carbon
metabolism pathway, with a heritability estimate of 44%
(38)
[heritability estimate range 8 – 57% (38 – 43)]. Until
recently, common genetic variations reported to inﬂuence
plasma folate, vitamin PLP, vitamin B12 and Hcy were
focused on genes in the one-carbon metabolism pathway,
speciﬁcally the Ala222Val polymorphism (23,44) (45) in
5,10 methylene-THF reductase (MTHFR), associated with
reduced conversion of methylene-THF to methyl-THF
(46,47). We previously identiﬁed a genome-wide signiﬁcant
association between common variants in FUT2 and plasma
vitamin B12 levels in women (48). In a recent genome-wide
analysis of data pooled from three genome-wide association
study (GWASs) of 2931 persons and a replication study of
687 participants, Tanaka et al. (49) conﬁrmed this loci and
reported additional loci that met genome-wide signiﬁcance cri-
teria for PLP. In the current study, we report a meta-analysis
of three GWASs with 4763 participants (1658 women in
CGEMS, 1647 women in SHARe and 1458 men in SHARe)
and test for the association between 2 404 675 genotyped or
imputed SNPs with an R-sq . 0.3 (R-sq_hat estimates the
squared correlation between imputed and true genotypes and
allows us to assess imputation accuracy for markers with
many different allele frequencies) in each study and plasma
levels of Hcy, folate, vitamin B12 and PLP.

RESULTS
Genome-wide signiﬁcant associations of P-value , 5  1028
[corresponding to P , 0.05 corrected P-value after adjusting
for approximately 1 million independent loci (50)] were ident-
iﬁed in meta-analyses for
log-transformed plasma Hcy,
vitamin B12 and PLP. Age and the distributions of plasma
vitamin B12 and homocysteine in the study populations are
described in Table 1. As expected, plasma Hcy was found to
be inversely related to plasma levels of folate, vitamin B12

Plasma homocysteine

The well-studied functional polymorphism in MTHFR
Ala222Val (also reported as MTHFR C677T), rs1801133, on
chromosome 1 [position (bp): 11,790,644] was associated

with plasma Hcy (P-value ¼ 1.27  1028; Fig. 1A; Table 2).

Participants with the Ala/Ala (G/G) variant had lower plasma
Hcy levels than variant carriers. Two other SNPs, rs12085006
[position (bp): 11,892,989] and rs1999594 [position (bp):
11,893,482], located 102 kb from MTHFR, had stronger associ-
ations with plasma Hcy (5.81  10210 and 6.24  10210,
respectively; Fig. 1A; Table 2). Participants homozygous for
the rs12085006 G and rs1999594 A alleles had higher Hcy
levels compared with variant carriers for each SNP. The
rs12085006 A allele is correlated with the MTHFR 222Val

allele (composite r2 ¼ 0.53; P , 0.0001) (51). After mutual

niﬁcantly associated with plasma Hcy (P ¼ 0.02 and 0.002,

respectively). Variant carriers of both MTHFR 222Val and the
A allele for rs12085006 had higher levels of plasma Hcy com-
pared with non-carriers. Similar results were obtained for
rs1999594. We also identiﬁed an association on chromosome

coupled receptor 51 (GPR51) gene, rs10986018, with plasma

Hcy (P-value¼2.06  1028; Fig. 1A, Table 2). A SNP,
rs11041321 in SYT9, reported by Tanaka et al. (49) with a
P-value of 1.11  1024 in their joint analysis of GWAS
meta-analysis and replication study, had a P-value¼0.44 in

our meta-analysis data. The SNPs in CBS, CPS1, MUT and

variant carriers had lower plasma folate compared with the

Ala/Ala variant (MTHFR Ala222Val P-value¼1.14  1023

disequilibrium (LD) with MTHFR Ala222Val and rs3737965

plasma folate in the report by Tanaka et al.
(49) had

P-value¼3.01  1023 in our analysis for plasma folate. The

rs153734 SNP in the PRICKLE gene, reported by Tanaka

Plasma vitamin B12

Genome-wide signiﬁcant associations were identiﬁed on
chromosomes 6, 10, 11 and 19 for plasma vitamin B12
(Fig. 1C; Table 2). Two SNPs, in LD, in Methylmalonyl-CoA
mutase (MUT) on chromosome 6p21—rs9473558 SNP and
rs9473555 [chromosome position (bp): 49,520,392 and
49,517,446, respectively]—were genome-wide signiﬁcant in
the meta-analysis for plasma vitamin B12 (P-meta¼4.91 
1028, 4.05  1028 respectively, Fig. 1; Table 2). Participants
homozygous for the rs9473558 C and rs9473555 G alleles had
higher B12 levels compared with participants homozygous for
the major allele. We identiﬁed an association (P ¼ 2.87 
1029; Fig. 1C; Table 2) between rs1801222 in CUBN
(Cubilin) on chromosome 10p12 and plasma vitamin B12
levels in the meta-analysis of 4763 participants. The SNP is
in exon 8 of CUBN and codes for an amino acid change

these data (composite r2 for rs1256335 and rs4654748 is
0.16, P , 0.0001).

DISCUSSION

We identiﬁed genome-wide signiﬁcant associations for plasma
homocysteine, plasma vitamin B12 and plasma PLP. SNPs in
chromosome 6p21, 10p12, 11q11 and 19q13 showed strong
signals for plasma vitamin B12. SNPs in chromosomes 1p36
and 9q22 were strongly associated with plasma homocysteine.
We identiﬁed genome-wide signiﬁcant associations between
SNPs in chromosome 1p36 and plasma PLP.

Plasma homocysteine

Chromosome 1p36. MTHFR is a key enzyme required for
DNA synthesis that catalyzes the irreversible transformation

of 5,10-MTHF into 5-MTHF (54). The TT variant alleles of
the well-known MTHFR 677 (amino acid change: MTHFR
Ala222Val) polymorphism are related to a 30% reduction in
enzyme activity (55). A decrease in MTHFR activity associ-
ated with the 222 Val/Val (677TT) polymorphism shifts the
folate pool, leading to an elevation in 5,10-methyleneTHF.
The MTHFR Ala222Val SNP results in a moderate (up to
15 – 19%) increase in mean Hcy levels between the Ala/Ala
and Val/Val variants (23), and this effect is greatly attenuated
in those individuals with mid-range to high folate levels (56).
Rs12085006 and rs1999594, located 102 kb from MTHFR,
had an even stronger association with plasma Hcy in our
meta-analysis. RS1999594 had a genome-wide signiﬁcant

association (P ¼ 8.5  10212) with plasma Hcy in the

Women’s Genome Health Study (WGHS), but only
rs180133 showed evidence for non-additive effects (52). The
rs1999594 SNP was reported by Tanaka et al. (49) to be
associated with plasma folate in a meta-analysis of 2931 par-

ticipants (P ¼ 1.12  1027), although the association did not

reach genome-wide signiﬁcance in their report on plasma
folate and was not reported for plasma Hcy. Given the
strong correlation between rs1999594 (or rs12085006) and
rs180133 and the modest evidence for association between
rs1999594 (or rs12085006) and plasma Hcy after adjusting
for MTHFR Ala222Val, we cannot conclude that these two
SNPs mark distinct loci associated with plasma Hcy.

Chromosome 9q22. We identiﬁed a genome-wide signiﬁcant
association between plasma Hcy and a variant in GPR51. Car-
riers of the rs10986018 T allele had lower plasma vitamin B12
compared with carriers of the CC variant. Expression of
GPR51 may be regulated by nicotine (57). Epidemiologic
studies have reported increased homocysteine levels
in
smokers compared with non-smokers (58 – 62). The associ-
ation with plasma Hcy and rs10986018 warrants future
study on plasma Hcy and effect modiﬁcation by smoking
status.

Plasma folate

We did not identify any genome-wide signiﬁcant association
with plasma folate in this meta-analysis, although the
MTHFR Ala222Val variant had the expected direction of
association (53,56), with a modest P-value. FHS SHARe
Exam 6 data available in dbGaP had the largest sample size
for all four plasma one-carbon metabolites and laboratory
assays comparable to the NHS CGEMS study population.
All NHS CGEMS participants had plasma folate measured
on blood drawn prior to folic acid fortiﬁcation (1989 – 1990).
However,
the Framingham SHARe laboratory exam 6
measurements were taken during 1995 – 1998. While the
majority of the SHARe participants included in this analysis
had measurements prior to the US mandate for folic acid for-
tiﬁcation in 1998, evidence suggests that the fortiﬁcation may
have started in 1996 – 1997. Pre-fortiﬁcation plasma folate
levels in the prior Framingham SHARe laboratory exam,
available in dbGaP, were measured using a microbial assay
and would not be equivalent to the HPLC assay used in the
NHS CGEMS data. We also recognize that there may also
be misclassiﬁcation due to folic acid supplementation.

Plasma vitamin B12

in the mitochondria,

Chromosome 6. MUT, located on chromosome 6p21, encodes
the mitochondrial enzyme methylmalonyl Coenzyme A (CoA)
mutase. MUT requires
5-prime-deoxyadenosylcobalamin
(AdoCbl, a coenzyme form of vitamin B12) to catalyze the iso-
merization of L-methylmalonyl – coenzyme A (CoA)
to
succinyl-CoA,
independent of folate
status. Mutations in methylmalonyl-CoA mutase, especially
in the C-terminus, result in methylmalonic aciduria (63 – 67).
A patient with the mut(-) MMA phenotype due to the MUT
Gly717Val variant was also homozygous for the His532Arg
(rs9473558) polymorphism (68). The T variant of rs9473558
has reduced vitamin B12 levels in our data and may be associ-
ated with decreased conversion of methylmalonyl CoA to suc-
cinyl CoA. The rs9473558 SNP in MUT was associated with
in the Women’s
Genome Health Study (WGHS) participants
(52). The
rs9473558 SNP was positively associated with plasma homo-

plasma homocysteine (P ¼ 2.1  10 – 7)

cysteine in the WGHS study (b¼ 0.020), but inversely associ-
ated with plasma vitamin B12
(b¼ 20.04), which is consistent with the inverse relationship
between homocysteine and vitamin B12. The expression of
MUT was associated with the rs9473555 SNP with a LOD
score ¼ 7.095 [enzyme activity for the G-allele is reduced

in our meta-analysis

by 0.42 standard deviation; mRNA by SNP browser 1-0-1
database (69)]. The preliminary association with rs9473558
or rs9473555 in the MUT gene and plasma vitamin B12
should be replicated in other studies. Future studies on the
relationship of
rs9473558 and MUT gene
expression is warranted.

rs9473555 or

Chromosome 10. Cubilin (CUBN) is located on chromosome
10p12.31. The 460 kd multiligand hydrophobic CUBN
protein binds to intrinsic factor-cobalamin (Cbl-IF) complexes
with a high afﬁnity and is expressed in both kidney and ileal
epithelial cells. Mutations in CUBN are associated with mega-
loblastic anemia and characterized by selective intestinal
vitamin B12 malabsorption (70). The P1297L mutation in
CUBN causes a 5-fold decrease of the binding domain afﬁnity
for Cbl-IF (the IF-Cbl binding region includes amino acids
928 – 1386). The rs1801222 (Ser253Phe) variant was associ-
ated with lower vitamin B12 levels in this study and may
decrease the binding and transport of vitamin B12 in the
ileum. Another SNP in CUBN reported by Tanaka et al. (49)
with a P-value of 1.11  1026, rs11254363, had a P-value
of 8.65  1025 in our meta-analysis. The neighboring gene,
located on 10p15.1 is a methyltransferase that
TRDMT1,
methylates
acid transfer RNA molecule
(tRNA(Asp))
(71). A recent study on spina biﬁda and
folate-related genes reported an association for different
SNPs in CUBN and TRDMT1 with increased serum RBC
folate levels in controls (72). Further research is warranted
to understand the LD pattern across the 305.3 kb CUBN
gene and the cis relationships of the genome-wide signiﬁcant
SNPs with CUBN and TRDMT1.

ing in lower plasma vitamin B12 levels.

variants in FUT2 on chromosome 19q13 and plasma vitamin

rs492602:

P-value¼3.52  10215;

[rs602662:

colorectal neoplasia data sets; (48)]. In the SHARe women
and the SHARe men data sets, we replicated our genome-wide
rs602662 (SHARe combined P ¼
signiﬁcant ﬁnding for
5.07  1028; Table 2 presents separate estimates and standard
error, by SHARe Men and Women) and in this meta-analysis
of CGEMS and SHARe data, we conﬁrm the association of
these SNPs with plasma vitamin B12. In this study of plasma
vitamin B12, we conﬁrm our previously reported hypothesis
that FUT2 W143X, a nonsense mutation (74) and determinant
of FUT2 secretor status, is the causal variant for the associ-

ation with plasma B12 levels (rs601338: P-value¼6.92 
10215). Individuals with the non-secretor status variant had
higher plasma vitamin B12 levels compared with carriers of
the secretor status genotypes. Reduced vitamin B12 absorption
(75 – 79) in carriers of the secretor genotype may be a conse-
quence of susceptibility to H. pylori infection compared with
individuals with the non-secretor genotype. The association
with rs602662 was replicated by an independent group (49)
with a P-value of 2.43  10212 in a meta-analysis of three
GWASs (n ¼ 2930 participants).

Plasma PLP

Mutations in the ALPL gene, on chromosome 1p36, are associ-
ated with hypophosphatasia. Increased circulating concen-
trations of PLP in all clinical forms of hypophosphatasia
have been reported by Whyte et al. (80,81). The ﬁndings
suggested that
tissue-non-speciﬁc alkaline phosphatase is
involved in vitamin B6 metabolism. The ALPL enzyme may
function as an ectoenzyme to regulate extracellular concen-
trations of PLP (80). The rs1256335 G allele had lower
plasma PLP levels compared with the homozygous A allele,
possibly due to increased hydrolysis of PLP (82). The
rs4654748 C allele, in the neuroblastoma breakpoint family,
member 3, (NBPF3, alternate name AE2) gene had lower
plasma PLP levels compared with the homozygous major
allele.

Comparability of plasma phenotypes in the study
population

The NHS and FHS study populations have comparable metab-
olite levels for conducting a meta-analysis of GWA data of
plasma one-carbon metabolites and the biomarker measure-
ment in these studies were all done in a single laboratory.
However, one limitation is that the NHS CGEMS participants
were all postmenopausal women, whereas SHARe Women
participants
included of both pre- and postmenopausal
women. Plasma Hcy is lower in premenopausal women than

men, but after menopause, homocysteine levels in women
increased to approach those in men, consistent with our data.
All NHS and the majority of the FHS blood samples for par-
ticipants in this analysis were collected prior to the introduc-
tion of folic acid fortiﬁcation of breads, cereals, ﬂours, corn
meal, pasta products, rice and other cereal grain products
sold in the USA (83,84). Therefore, the genetic variability
signal should not be attenuated by this recent environmental
inﬂuence.

In summary, for plasma vitamin B12, we replicated our
ﬁnding for FUT2 (48) and identiﬁed genome-wide signiﬁcant
SNPs in biological candidate genes: TCN1, a vitamin B12
binding protein; MUT, which converts methylmalonyl CoA
to succinyl CoA; and CUBN, the receptor for intrinsic factor-
vitamin B12 complexes. For plasma homocysteine, we
observed genome-wide signiﬁcant associations with the
MTHFR functional SNP Ala222Val and a possible new inde-
pendent locus 102 kb upstream of MTHFR. For plasma PLP,
we noted genome-wide signiﬁcant associations in ALPL.
These data reveal new biological candidates and conﬁrm
prior candidate genes for plasma homocysteine, plasma
vitamin B12 and plasma PLP.

All participants provided written informed consent, and local
institutional review boards approved the study protocols.

Study populations

We conducted a meta-analysis of genome-wide data in 1658
women genotyped with the HumanHap500 as part of the
Cancer Genetic Markers of Susceptibility Project (CGEMS)
and in 1682 women genotyped with the Affymetrix 500K
mapping array and the Affymetrix 50K Supplementary array
as a part of the SNP Health Association Resource (SHARe
data set, part of NHLBI FHS) to identify novel loci that inﬂu-
ence plasma one-carbon metabolite levels. All participants
were of self-reported European ancestry.

The Nurses’ Health Study (NHS)

histories

and

reporting medical

The NHS was initiated in 1976, when 121 700 US registered
nurses between the ages of 30 and 55 returned an initial ques-
tionnaire
baseline
health-related exposures. Every 2 years, follow-up question-
naires are mailed to the participants (questionnaire response
rate .90% for all follow-up cycles). Diet was assessed in
1986, 1990, 1994 and 1996 with a semiquantitative food fre-
quency questionnaire. Between 1989 and 1990, blood
samples and relevant sample collection information were col-
lected from 32 826 women.

The CGEMS project (http://www.cgems.cancer.gov) is an
NCI initiative to conduct genome-wide association studies
(GWAS) to identify genes involved in breast and prostate
cancer. The initial CGEMS scan, designed and funded only
to study the main effect of SNP variants on breast cancer
risk in postmenopausal women, has been completed (85).

A subset of the participants in the CGEMS project also has
been assayed for plasma vitamin B12. The NHS CGEMS par-
ticipants had similar laboratory measurement of the plasma
one-carbon metabolites as well as host characteristics and
blood draw features (fasting status and year and month of
blood draw).

10 study samples (27,37). No signiﬁcant differences in mean
levels of plasma homocysteine, folate, vitamin B12 or PLP
were detected by breast cancer case – control status in the
NHS. The mean coefﬁcient of variation for 75 pairs of repli-
cate 6.5% for folate, 7.9% for homocysteine, 7.3% for B12
and 7.2% for PLP (27).

Framingham Heart Study (FHS)

The FHS began in 1948 with the enrollment of two-thirds of
the adult population of Framingham, Massachusetts (86),
including 2873 women aged 28 – 62 years. In 1971, 5124 off-
spring of the original cohort members and offspring spouses
were enrolled in the Framingham Heart Study,
including
2641 women ranging in age from 12 to 60 years. A data set
consisting of repeated and highly accurate measurements of
many different phenotypes collected over multiple exam bien-
nial cycles is available for each participant. The NHLBI Fra-
mingham SNP-Health Association Resource (SHARe) is a
large-scale GWAS on the FHS original, offspring and third-
generation cohorts with data accessible to the research com-
munity (87). In the Framingham cohort,
the SNP Health
Association Resource (SHARe) project genotyped 9274 Cau-
casian participants with the Affymetrix 500K mapping array
and the Affymetrix 50K supplemental array (Affymetrix,
Santa Clara, CA, USA). The 8508 samples from these partici-
pants had a sample call rate 97% (88,89). Of the participants
from the Framingham original and offspring cohorts, with
measured plasma one-carbon metabolites at laboratory exam
6, between 1995 and 1998, the SHARe scan included 1647
(16) Caucasian women and 1458 Caucasian men. Exam 6
had the largest sample size for all four plasma one-carbon
metabolites and laboratory assays comparable to the NHS
CGEMS study population.

Laboratory assays

Plasma levels of homocysteine for both the NHS CGEMS and
FHS SHARe studies were measured by high-performance
liquid chromatography, with ﬂuorescence detection (90).
Plasma levels of
the NHS
CGEMS and FHS SHARe participants were measured using
by a radioassay kit (Bio-Rad, Richmond, CA, USA) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. Plasma PLP levels were
measured by an enzymatic procedure using radioactive tyro-
sine and the apo-enzyme tyrosine decarboxylase.

All assays were conducted at the Jean Mayer U.S. Depart-
ment of Agriculture Human Nutrition Research Center on
Aging at Tufts University. Plasma samples for matched
case – control sets were always positioned next to each other,
in random order, in boxes sent to the lab and were assessed
in the same batch to minimize the impact of laboratory error
due to batch drift. Quality control (QC) samples were also sub-
mitted with each batch and were randomly placed throughout
the boxes (two assay batches were used for NHS CGEMS par-
ticipants). Laboratory technicians were blinded to case, control
and QC status of the samples. QC samples consisted of repli-
cates of two pools of plasma. One QC sample was assayed per

Reliability of laboratory assays of plasma levels

In an analysis of 188 NHS participants, the correlation coefﬁ-
cients between folate intake calculated from the 1980 food fre-
quency questionnaire and erythrocyte folate concentrations in
1987 were 0.55 for folate from foods and supplementation and
0.38 for folate from food only (18). Similar correlation coefﬁ-
cients were noted for plasma folate (0.55 for total folate; 0.35
for dietary folate) (18,27). The intraclass correlation coefﬁ-
cient over a 3-year period on 82 participants was 0.63 for
plasma folate, suggesting reproducibility of these measure-
ments over time.

Ilumina SNP genotyping and quality-control analysis

Genotyping in the CGEMS project was carried out using the
Illumina Inﬁnium Sentrix HumanHap550 bead chip, which
contains 556 566 SNPs derived from the HapMap phase I
and II data (85). The polymorphisms on the bead chip are
selected to be direct surrogates (R2, a measure of pair-wise
SNP correlation, .0.8) of more than 75% of the common
polymorphisms genotyped as part of the HapMap Phase II
project. Overall, genotyping success was 98.45% of the poss-
ible genotypes in the ﬁrst attempt and 99.27% after failed
samples were repeated. Quality control of genotyping reprodu-
cibility was 99.99%. SNPs with signiﬁcant deviations from
Hardy – Weinberg (HWE) proportions (5% of SNPs at the

level of P ¼ 0.05 and 1.28% at P ¼ 0.01) were not excluded

from the analysis, as the tests for association applied to
these data are valid in the presence of departure from HW pro-
portions. The NHS cases and controls included in CGEMS are
of self-reported European ancestry (85). Four samples (three
cases and one control) were removed because of intercontinen-
tal admixture. In the CGEMS data, we saw no evidence for
systematic bias in the distribution of P-values for analyses
with and without further adjustment for residual population
structure using four principal components of genetic variation
compatible with no confounding of SNP-metabolite associ-
ations due to population stratiﬁcation (85,91). A total of
1658 NHS participants had GWAS and plasma vitamin B12
data.

Affymetrix SNP genotyping and quality-control analysis

Genotyping in the SHARe study (88,89) was carried out using
the Affymetrix (Santa Clara, CA, USA) GeneChip Human
Mapping 500K mapping array and supplemental 50K
mapping array (HuGeneFocused50K) with gene-centric and
coding SNPs. The Human Mapping 500K Array Set is com-
prised of two arrays, each capable of genotyping on average
250 000 SNPs (approximately 262 000 for Nsp arrays and
238 000 for Sty arrays).

4684

Human Molecular Genetics, 2009, Vol. 18, No. 23

Association analyses were restricted to individuals with
97% genotyping call-rate. SNP results were ﬁltered on
Hardy – Weinberg equilibrium P-value of 1  1026, SNP call-
rate of 95% and minor allele frequency (MAF) of 0.01. After
cleaning the genotype data, 347 K SNPs were available for the
analysis.

Statistical methods

We tested the association between log-transformed plasma
one-carbon metabolite levels and each SNP using linear
regression adjusted for age. SNP genotypes were coded as
counts of minor alleles (additive coding) unless otherwise
speciﬁed. We adopted an additive coding because it has
nearly optimal power for a range of realistic genetic models,
with the exception of rare recessive effects, which we have
little power to detect (92). In CGEMS, we further adjusted
for principal components of genetic variation, calculated
with the EIGENSTRAT software (91).

The SHARe data were analyzed using linear mixed effects
models to account for residual familial correlation; aside
from ﬁxed effects (age, SNP genotype), this model includes
individual random effects with a correlation matrix equal to
the kinship matrix times a scalar variance parameter. These
analyses were implemented using the lmekin function in the
R package kinship.

We imputed SNP genotypes using the hidden Markov
model
implemented in MACH 1.0 (http://www.sph.umich
.edu/csg/abecasis/MACH/index.html) for each CGEMS and
SHARe separately. For the SHARe data, the hidden Markov
model was trained using unrelated founders (922 women and
692 biologically unrelated men); the ﬁtted model was then
used to infer missing genotypes for the remaining subjects.
The certainty of the imputation is dependent on the stretches
of haplotypes shared between the reference panel (HapMap
Phase II CEU population) and the study population. The
imputation result at each of the imputed SNPs, per study par-
ticipant, can be expressed as a set of three genotype probabil-
ities, that vary between 0 and 1 per genotype and sum to 1, or
as an ‘allele dosage’, which is deﬁned as the expected number
of copies of the minor allele at each SNP and varies between 0
and 2. In the CGEMS data, we evaluated both methods and
obtained comparable results for the genotype probabilities
and allele dosage methods. In the SHARe data, we evaluated
both methods for the genome-wide signiﬁcant associations
and obtained comparable results for the genotype probabilities
and allele dosage methods.

Genotyped and imputed SNPs with an R-sq_hat from
MACH .0.30 in both the CGEMS Illumina and SHARe
Affymetrix data were used for a meta-analysis (93)
to
examine the association between 2.5million polymorphisms
and the plasma metabolites. A ﬁxed-effect model was used to
pool the results for the NHS CGEMS, SHARe Women and
SHARe Men studies. Cochran’s Q statistic and tau-squared
were used to test for between-study heterogeneity, and the
I-squared statistic to quantify the proportion of total variation
due to heterogeneity will be calculated (94). We saw no evi-
dence for systematic bias in the distribution of P-values
from the meta-analyses (Supplementary Material, Fig. S1).
The P-for-heterogeneity is reported in Table 2. SAS PROC

GLM was used to test the independence of the estimates of
multiple SNPs in a model. Composite LD was calculated
according to the notation of Weir (51).

Our analyses do not explicitly account for the ascertainment
of subjects on the basis of primary disease (breast cancer for
the NHS CGEMS; Framingham SHARe data are from a
cohort study and not ascertained on disease). This approach
is appropriate, since our loci of interest are not associated
with primary disease evaluated in the CGEMS NHS partici-
pants (85,95). All P-values are based on two-sided tests. All
statistical analyses were performed with SAS (version 9.1;
SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA), R project
(http://www.
r-project.org) and PLINK (96).
