Background: High intakes of red or processed meat may
increase the risk of mortality. Our objective was to de-
termine the relations of red, white, and processed meat
intakes to risk for total and cause-specific mortality.

Methods: The study population included the National
Institutes of Health–AARP (formerly known as the Ameri-
can Association of Retired Persons) Diet and Health Study
cohort of half a million people aged 50 to 71 years at base-
line. Meat intake was estimated from a food frequency
questionnaire administered at baseline. Cox propor-
tional hazards regression models estimated hazard ra-
tios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) within
quintiles of meat intake. The covariates included in the
models were age, education, marital status, family his-
tory of cancer (yes/no) (cancer mortality only), race, body
mass index, 31-level smoking history, physical activity,
energy intake, alcohol intake, vitamin supplement use,
fruit consumption, vegetable consumption, and meno-
pausal hormone therapy among women. Main outcome
measures included total mortality and deaths due to can-
cer, cardiovascular disease, injuries and sudden deaths,
and all other causes.

in the highest vs lowest quintile of red (HR, 1.31 [95%
CI, 1.27-1.35], and HR, 1.36 [95% CI, 1.30-1.43], re-
spectively) and processed meat (HR, 1.16 [95% CI, 1.12-
1.20], and HR, 1.25 [95% CI, 1.20-1.31], respectively)
intakes had elevated risks for overall mortality. Regard-
ing cause-specific mortality, men and women had el-
evated risks for cancer mortality for red (HR, 1.22 [95%
CI, 1.16-1.29], and HR, 1.20 [95% CI, 1.12-1.30], re-
spectively) and processed meat (HR, 1.12 [95% CI, 1.06-
1.19], and HR, 1.11 [95% CI 1.04-1.19], respectively) in-
takes. Furthermore, cardiovascular disease risk was
elevated for men and women in the highest quintile of
red (HR, 1.27 [95% CI, 1.20-1.35], and HR, 1.50 [95%
CI, 1.37-1.65], respectively) and processed meat (HR, 1.09
[95% CI, 1.03-1.15], and HR, 1.38 [95% CI, 1.26-1.51],
respectively) intakes. When comparing the highest with
the lowest quintile of white meat intake, there was an in-
verse association for total mortality and cancer mortal-
ity, as well as all other deaths for both men and women.

Conclusion: Red and processed meat intakes were as-
sociated with modest increases in total mortality, can-
cer mortality, and cardiovascular disease mortality.

Results: There were 47 976 male deaths and 23 276 fe-
male deaths during 10 years of follow-up. Men and women

analyses of meat intake have been carried
out in Seventh-Day Adventists in the
United States1,2 and other vegetarian popu-
lations in Europe.3-6 Vegetarian diets dif-
fer from nonvegetarian diets in several re-
spects. The main sources of protein in a

vegetarian diet are legumes, grains, and
nuts. Vegetarian diets also include higher
intakes of vegetables, unsaturated fats, di-
etary fiber, and antioxidants (carot-
enoids and vitamins C and E), although
they contain lower amounts of iron, zinc,
and vitamin B12. Furthermore, other life-
style factors, such as smoking, physical ac-
tivity, and alcohol consumption among
vegetarians and members of select reli-
gious groups can differ substantially from
the general population.

We prospectively investigated red, white,
and processed meat intakes as risk factors
for total mortality, as well as cause-
specific mortality, including cancer and car-
diovascular disease (CVD) mortality in a co-
hort of approximately half a million men

(NIH)–AARP (formerly known as the American Associa-
tion of Retired Persons) Diet and Health Study.7 This large
prospective study facilitated the investigation of a wide
range of meat intakes with chronic disease mortality.

METHODS

STUDY POPULATION

Individuals aged 50 to 71 years were recruited from 6 US states
(California, Florida, Louisiana, New Jersey, North Carolina, and
Pennsylvania) and 2 metropolitan areas (Atlanta, Georgia, and
Detroit, Michigan) to form a large prospective cohort, the NIH-
AARP Diet and Health Study. Questionnaires on demographic
and lifestyle characteristics, including dietary habits, were mailed
to 3.5 million members of AARP in 1995, as described in de-
tail elsewhere.7 The NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study was ap-
proved by the Special Studies Institutional Review Board of the
US National Cancer Institute. Completion of the baseline ques-
tionnaire was considered to imply informed consent.

DIETARY ASSESSMENT

A 124-item food frequency questionnaire (http://riskfactor
.cancer.gov/DHQ/forms/files/shared/dhq1.2002.sample.pdf) was
completed at baseline. The food frequency questionnaire col-
lected information on the usual consumption of foods and drinks
and portion sizes over the last 12 months. The validity of the
food frequency questionnaire was estimated using two 24-
hour recalls,8 and the estimated energy-adjusted correlations
ranged from 0.36 to 0.76 for various nutrients and attenuation
factors ranged from 0.24 to 0.68. Red meat intake was calcu-
lated using the frequency of consumption and portion size in-
formation of all types of beef and pork and included bacon, beef,
cold cuts, ham, hamburger, hotdogs, liver, pork, sausage, steak,
and meats in foods such as pizza, chili, lasagna, and stew. White
meat included chicken, turkey, and fish and included poultry
cold cuts, chicken mixtures, canned tuna, and low-fat sau-
sages and low-fat hotdogs made from poultry. Processed meat
included bacon, red meat sausage, poultry sausage, luncheon
meats (red and white meat), cold cuts (red and white meat),
ham, regular hotdogs and low-fat hotdogs made from poultry.
The components constituting red or white and processed meats
can overlap because both can include meats such as bacon, sau-
sage, and ham, while processed meat can also included smoked
turkey and chicken. However, these meat groups are not used
in the same models; thus, they are not duplicated in any one
analysis.

To investigate whether the overall composition of meat in-
take was associated with mortality, we created 3 diet types: high-,
medium-, and low-risk meat diet. To form these diet variables,
red and white meat consumption was energy adjusted and split
into 2 groups using the median values as cut points. Individuals
with red meat consumption in the upper half and white meat con-
sumption in the lower half got a score of 1 (high-risk meat diet),
those with both red and white meat consumption in the same half
got a score of 2 (medium-risk meat diet), and those with red meat
consumption in the lower half and white meat consumption in
the upper half got a score of 3 (low-risk meat diet).

COHORT FOLLOW-UP AND CASE

ASCERTAINMENT

Cohort members were followed-up from the date the baseline
questionnaire was returned (beginning 1995) through Decem-

ber 31, 2005, by annual linkage of the cohort to the National
Change of Address database maintained by the US Postal Ser-
vice and through processing of undeliverable mail, other ad-
dress change update services, and directly from cohort mem-
bers’ notifications. For matching purposes, we have virtually
complete data on first and last name, address history, sex, and
date of birth. Follow-up for vital status is performed by annual
linkage of the cohort to the Social Security Administration Death
Master File in the US verification of vital status, and cause of
death information is provided by follow-up searches of the Na-
tional Death Index (NDI) Plus with the current follow-up for
mortality covered until 2005.

CAUSE-SPECIFIC CASE ASCERTAINMENT

Cancer (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision
[ICD-9] codes 140-239 and International Statistical Classifica-
tion of Diseases, 10th Revision [ICD-10] codes C00-C44, C45.0,
C45.1, C45.7, C45.9, C48-C97, and D12-D48) mortality in-
cluded deaths due to cancers of the oral cavity and pharynx,
digestive tract, respiratory tract, soft tissue (including heart),
skin (excluding basal and squamous cell carcinoma), female
genital system and breast, male genital system, urinary tract,
endocrine system, lymphoma, leukemia, and other miscella-
neous cancers.

Cardiovascular disease (ICD-9 codes 390-398, 401-404, 410-
438, and 440-448 and ICD-10 codes I00-I09, I10-I13, I20-I51, and
I60-I78) mortality was from a combination of diseases of the heart;
hypertension without heart disease; cerebrovascular diseases; ath-
erosclerosis; aortic aneurysm and dissection; and other diseases
of the arteries, arterioles, and capillaries.

Mortality from injuries and sudden deaths (ICD-9 codes 800-
978 and ICD-10 codes U01-U03, V01-Y09, Y35, Y85-Y86, Y87.0,
Y87.1, and Y89.0) included deaths due to unintentional in-
jury, adverse effects, suicide, self-inflicted injury, homicide, and
legal intervention.

All others deaths included mortality from tuberculosis, hu-
man immunodeficiency virus, other infectious and parasitic dis-
eases, septicemia, diabetes mellitus, Alzheimer disease, stom-
ach and duodenal ulcers, pneumonia and influenza, chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease and allied conditions, chronic
liver disease and cirrhosis, nephritis, nephrotic syndrome and
nephrosis, congenital anomalies, certain conditions originat-
ing in the perinatal period, ill-defined conditions, and un-
known causes of death.

Total mortality is a combination of all of the aforemen-

tioned causes of deaths.

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS

A total of 617 119 persons returned the baseline question-
naire; of these, we excluded individuals who moved out of the
8 study areas before returning the baseline questionnaire
(n=321), requested to be withdrawn from the study (n=829),
died before study entry (n=261), had duplicate records (n=179),
indicated that they were not the intended respondent and did
not complete the questionnaire (n=13 442), provided no in-
formation on gender (n=6), and did not answer substantial por-
tions of the questionnaire or had more than 10 recording er-
rors (n=35 679). After these exclusions, we further removed
individuals whose questionnaire was filled in by someone else
on their behalf (n=15 760). We excluded 4849 subjects report-
ing extreme daily total energy intake defined as more than 2
interquartile ranges above the 75th percentile or below the 25th
percentile and 140 people who had zero person-years of follow-
up. After all exclusions, our analytic cohort comprised 322 263
men and 223 390 women.

tervals (CIs) with time since entry into the study as the under-
lying time metric using Cox proportional hazards regression
models. Quintile cut points were based on the entire cohort,
and multivariate-adjusted HRs are reported using the lowest
quintile as the referent category. The violation of the propor-
tional hazard assumption was investigated by testing an inter-
action between a time-dependent binary covariate, which in-
dicated if follow-up was in the first 5 years or in the second 5
years, and the quintile terms for meat consumption. Dietary
variables were energy adjusted using the nutrient density
method, and meat variables in each model added up to total
meat (addition model). For example, one model contained both
red and white meat, while the processed meat model also con-
tained a nonprocessed meat variable.

To address confounding, we used forward stepwise vari-
able selection to include covariates to develop the fully ad-
justed model. Smoking was the largest confounder of the as-
sociation between meat intake and mortality. Physical activity
and education were also important covariates, but not to the same
degree as smoking. The final model included age (continuous);
education (⬍8 years or unknown, 8-11 years, 12 years [high
school], some college, or college graduate); marital status (mar-
ried: yes/no); family history of cancer (yes/no) (cancer mortal-
ity only); race (non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Hispanic/
Asian/Pacific Islander/American Indian/Alaskan native, or
unknown); body mass index (18.5 to ⬍25, 25 to ⬍30, 30 to ⬍35,
ⱖ35 [calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in me-
ters squared]); 31-level smoking history using smoking status
(never, former, or current), time since quitting for former smok-
ers and smoking dose; frequency of vigorous physical activity
(never/rarely, 1-3 times/mo, 1-2 times/wk, 3-4 times/wk, ⱖ5 times/
wk); total energy intake (continuous); alcohol intake (none, 0
to ⬍5, 5 to ⬍15, 15 to ⬍30, ⱖ30 g/d); vitamin supplement user
(ⱖ1 supplement/mo); fruit consumption (0 to ⬍0.7, 0.7 to ⬍1.2,
1.2 to ⬍1.7, 1.7 to ⬍2.5, ⱖ2.5 servings/1000 kcal); vegetable
consumption (0 to ⬍1.3, 1.3 to ⬍1.8, 1.8 to ⬍2.2, 2.2 to ⬍3.0,
ⱖ3.0 servings/1000 kcal); and menopausal hormone therapy
among women in the multivariate models.

In subanalyses, we investigated the relation between meat
intake and mortality by smoking status. We used median val-
ues of each quintile to test for linear trend with 2-sided P val-
ues. We also calculated population-attributable risks as an es-
timate of the percentage of mortality that could be prevented
if individuals adopted intake levels of participants within the
first quintile. This was computed as 1 minus the ratio consist-
ing of the sum of the estimated HR (derived from the Cox pro-
portional hazard regression models) of each member of the co-
hort divided by the sum of the estimated HR for which meat
exposure was assigned to the lowest or highest quintile, de-
pending on which quintile was the ideal level of meat con-
sumption. The population-attributable risk was multiplied by
100 to convert them to a percentage. All statistical analyses were
carried out using Statistical Analytic Systems (SAS) software
(SAS Institute Inc, Cary, North Carolina).

RESULTS

During 10 years of follow-up, there were 47 976 male
deaths and 23 276 female deaths. In general, those in the
highest quintile of red meat intake tended to consume a
slightly lower amount of white meat but a higher amount
of processed meat compared with those in the lowest quin-
tile. Subjects who consumed more red meat tended to
be married, more likely of non-Hispanic white ethnic-
ity, more likely a current smoker, have a higher body mass

index, and have a higher daily intake of energy, total fat,
and saturated fat, and they tended to have lower educa-
tion and physical activity levels and lower fruit, veg-
etable, fiber, and vitamin supplement intakes (Table 1).

RED MEAT

There was an overall increased risk of total, cancer, and
CVD mortality, as well as all other deaths in both men
(Table 2) and women (Table 3) in the highest com-
pared with the lowest quintile of red meat intake in the
fully adjusted model. There was an increased risk asso-
ciated with death from injuries and sudden death with
higher consumption of red meat in men but not in
women.

WHITE MEAT

When comparing the highest with the lowest quintile of
white meat intake, there was an inverse association for
total mortality and cancer mortality, as well as all other
deaths for both men (Table 2) and women (Table 3). In
contrast, there was a small increase in risk for CVD mor-
tality in men with higher intake of white meat. There was
no association between white meat consumption and
death from injuries and sudden death in men or women.

PROCESSED MEAT

There was an overall increased risk of total, cancer, and CVD
mortality, as well as all other deaths in both men (Table 2)
and women (Table 3) in the highest compared with the low-
est quintile of processed meat intake. In contrast, there was
no association for processed meat intake and death from
injuries and sudden death in either sex.

A lag analysis, excluding deaths occurring in the first
2 years of follow-up, produced results consistent with the
main findings in Table 2 and Table 3. For example, the
HRs for total mortality in men for red meat was as fol-
lows: second quintile HR, 1.05 (95% CI, 1.01-1.09); third
quintile HR, 1.13 (95% CI, 1.09-1.17); fourth quintile
HR, 1.20 (95% CI, 1.16-1.24); and fifth quintile HR, 1.30
(95% CI, 1.26-1.35). For women, the HRs were as fol-
lows: second quintile HR, 1.07 (95% CI, 1.02-1.12); third
quintile HR, 1.15 (95% CI, 1.11-1.21); fourth quintile
HR, 1.27 (95% CI, 1.21-1.33); and fifth quintile HR, 1.35
(95% CI, 1.28-1.42). Furthermore, we investigated our
models for a violation of the proportional hazard as-
sumption. Proportional hazard assumption was not re-
jected for all analyses except one, the model with red and
white meat among the women for total mortality (P=.008).
On further examination in that model of the relative HR
between the first 5 years of follow-up and the second 5
years of follow-up, the red meat results were consistent
between the 2 follow-up periods. However, for white meat,
the second 5-year period showed less of an inverse trend
compared with the first 5-year period (data not shown).
We investigated whether people who consumed a high-
risk meat diet had mortality risk profiles that were dif-
ferent from people who consumed a low-risk meat diet.
Both men and women who consumed a low-risk meat
diet had statistically significant lower HRs compared with

people who consumed a high-risk meat diet for all-
cause, cancer, and CVD mortality, as well as all other
deaths; for example, for all-cause mortality, the HR for a
low-risk meat diet was 0.92 (95% CI, 0.80-0.94) for men
and 0.80 (95% CI, 0.78-0.84) for women.

To further explore possible confounding by smoking,
we analyzed meat intake and mortality in 2 subgroups—
never smokers (15 413 deaths among 190 135 never smok-
ers) and former/current smokers (n=52 754 deaths among
335 036 former/current smokers). For men, the risks in the
fifth quintile of red meat intake for never and former/
current smokers were as follows: for total mortality, HR,
1.28 (95% CI, 1.19-1.38), and HR, 1.25 (95% CI, 1.20-
1.30), respectively; for cancer mortality, HR, 1.16 (95% CI,

1.02-1.33), and HR, 1.17 (95% CI, 1.09-1.24), respec-
tively; and for CVD mortality, HR, 1.43 (95% CI, 1.25-
1.63), and HR, 1.17 (95% CI, 1.10-1.26), respectively. In
women, the risks in the fifth quintile of red meat intake for
never and former/current smokers were as follows: for total
mortality, HR, 1.36 (95% CI, 1.25-1.48), and HR, 1.28 (95%
CI, 1.21-1.35), respectively; for cancer mortality, HR, 1.10
(95% CI, 0.95-1.27), and HR, 1.16 (95% CI, 1.06-1.27),
respectively; and for CVD mortality, HR, 1.63 (95% CI, 1.38-
1.93), and HR, 1.34 (95% CI, 1.18-1.51), respectively. Risks
were similar for the 2 smoking categories in most in-
stances for processed meat except for cancer mortality, for
which we found a null relation for both sexes in never smok-
ers (men: HR, 1.01 [95% CI, 0.88-1.15]; women: HR, 1.02

[95% CI, 0.89-1.17]), but in former/current smokers we
found higher risks (men: HR, 1.12 [95% CI, 1.05-1.19];
women: HR, 1.11 [95% CI, 1.02-1.21]). Intriguingly, there
was increased risk with higher intake of white meat for CVD
mortality in never smokers (men: HR, 1.24 [95% CI, 1.10-
1.40]; women: HR, 1.20 [95% CI, 1.03-1.41]).

We calculated the population attributable risks, rep-
resenting the percentage of deaths that could be pre-
vented if individuals adopted red or processed meat in-
take levels of participants within the first quintile. For
overall mortality, 11% of deaths in men and 16% of deaths
in women could be prevented if people decreased their
red meat consumption to the level of intake in the first
quintile. The impact on CVD mortality was an 11% de-
crease in men and a 21% decrease in women if the red
meat consumption was decreased to the amount con-
sumed by individuals in the first quintile. The median
red meat consumption based on men and women in the
first quintile was 9.8 g/1000 kcal/d compared with 62.5
g/1000 kcal/d in the fifth quintile. For women eating pro-
cessed meat at the first quintile level, the decrease in CVD
mortality was approximately 20%. The median pro-
cessed meat consumption based on men and women in
the first quintile was 1.6 g/1000 kcal/d compared with
22.6 g/1000 kcal/d in the fifth quintile.

COMMENT

We examined total and cause-specific mortality in rela-
tion to meat consumption in a large prospective study.
We found modest increases in risk for total mortality, as
well as cancer and CVD mortality, with higher intakes
of red and processed meat in both men and women. In
contrast, higher white meat consumption was associ-
ated with a small decrease in total and cancer mortality
in men and women.

The principal strength of this study is the large size
of the cohort, which provided us the ability to investi-
gate the relationship of many deaths (47 976 male deaths
and 23 276 female deaths) within the context of a single
study with a standardized protocol and a wide range of
meat consumption. In contrast, other reports investigat-
ing meat intake in relation to mortality have pooled data
from different studies conducted in California, the United
Kingdom, and Germany because the numbers of events
were limited in each study.1-6,9-14 The protocols and ques-
tionnaires in these studies were different, as were the
populations: Seventh-Day Adventists in California and
vegetarians and nonvegetarians in Europe. Pooled analy-
ses of specialized populations with distinct healthy life-
styles are subject to unmeasured confounding. Further-

more, recall bias and reverse causality were minimized
in our study because diet was assessed prior to the diag-
nosis of the conditions that led to death.

There is a possibility that some residual confounding
by smoking may remain; however, we used a detailed 31-
level smoking history variable and repeated the analyses
within smoking status strata. Within smoking subgroups,
we found consistent results for red, white, and processed
meat intakes; however, there were some intriguing differ-
ences that could be further investigated. We found a posi-
tive association for processed meat intake and cancer mor-
tality among former/current smokers but not among never
smokers. This may be because we were still not able to fully
statistically adjust for residual confounding of smoking be-
cause people who eat processed meat may also smoke. An

additional reason could be that in addition to being ex-
posed to N-nitroso compounds from processed meats,
smokers inhale carcinogenic chemicals. The possible rea-
son why there was an increased risk with white meat con-
sumption among never smokers is not readily apparent.
Because our cohort was predominantly non-
Hispanic white, more educated, consumed less fat and
red meat and more fiber and fruits and vegetables, and
had fewer current smokers than similarly aged adults in
the US population, caution should be applied when at-
tempting to generalize our findings to other popula-
tions,7 although this caution is somewhat tempered be-
cause it is unlikely that the mechanisms relating meat to
mortality differ quantitatively between our study popu-
lation and other white populations older than 50 years.

aData are given as hazard ratio (95% confidence interval) unless otherwise specified.
bMedian red meat intake based on men and women (g/1000 kcal): Q1, 9.8; Q2, 21.4; Q3, 31.3; Q4, 42.8; and Q5, 62.5.
cBasic model: age (continuous); race (non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Hispanic/Asian/Pacific Islander/American Indian/Alaskan native, or unknown);

and total energy intake (continuous).

dAdjusted model: basic model plus education (⬍8 years or unknown, 8-11 years, 12 years [high school], some college, or college graduate); marital status

(married: yes/no); family history of cancer (yes/no) (cancer mortality only); body mass index (18.5 to ⬍25, 25 to ⬍30, 30 to ⬍35, ⱖ35 [calculated as weight in
kilograms divided by height in meters squared]); 31-level smoking history using smoking status (never, former, current), time since quitting for former smokers,
and smoking dose; frequency of vigorous physical activity (never/rarely, 1-3 times/mo, 1-2 times/wk, 3-4 times/wk, ⱖ5 times/wk); alcohol intake (none, 0 to ⬍5,
5 to ⬍15, 15 to ⬍30, ⱖ30 servings/1000 kcal), vitamin supplement user (ⱖ1 supplement/mo); fruit consumption (0 to ⬍0.7, 0.7 to ⬍1.2, 1.2 to ⬍1.7, 1.7 to
⬍2.5, ⱖ2.5 servings/1000 kcal); and vegetable consumption (0 to ⬍1.3, 1.3 to ⬍1.8, 1.8 to ⬍2.2, 2.2 to ⬍3.0, ⱖ3.0 serving/1000 kcal).

eHormone therapy included in models for women.
fMedian white meat intake based on men and women (g/1000 kcal): Q1, 9.5; Q2, 18.4; Q3, 27.4; Q4, 39.4; and Q5, 64.6.
gMedian processed meat intake based on men and women (g/1000 kcal): Q1, 1.6; Q2, 4.4; Q3, 7.4; Q4, 12.2; and Q5, 22.6.

Furthermore, the population-attributable risks in our co-
hort may be conservative estimates because red and pro-
cessed meat consumption may be higher in the general
population than in our cohort.

The inherent limitations of measurement error in this
study are similar to those of any nutritional epidemio-
logic study that is based on recall of usual intake over a
given period. We attempted to reduce measurement er-
ror by adjusting our models for reported energy in-
take.15 The correlations for red meat consumption as-
sessed from the food frequency questionnaire compared
with two 24-hour recall diaries were 0.62 for men and
0.70 for women, as reported previously by Schatzkin et
al.7 The problem of residual confounding may still exist
and could explain the relatively small associations found
throughout this study despite the care taken to adjust for
known confounders.

Overall, we did not find statistically significant asso-
ciation between meat consumption and deaths from in-
jury and sudden deaths in most instances. The relative
HRs of meat consumption with the other causes of death
(total, cancer, and CVD mortality) were similar in mag-
nitude in some cases to those of deaths from injury and
sudden deaths; however, the number of deaths from in-

jury and sudden deaths was less than the other causes of
deaths, and thus the HRs were generally not statistically
significant. We observed a higher risk with the category
that included “all other deaths”; this is a broad category
with many heterogeneous conditions (eg, diabetes melli-
tus, Alzheimer disease, stomach and duodenal ulcers,
chronic liver disease, cirrhosis, nephritis, nephrotic syn-
drome, and nephrosis), some of which may be posi-
tively related to meat intake.

There are various mechanisms by which meat may be
related to mortality. In relation to cancer, meat is a source
of several multisite carcinogens, including heterocyclic
amines and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons,16-21 which
are both formed during high-temperature cooking of meat,
as well as N-nitroso compounds.22,23 Iron in red meat may
increase oxidative damage and increase the formation of
N-nitroso compounds.24-27 Furthermore, meat is a ma-
jor source of saturated fat, which has been positively as-
sociated with breast28-30 and colorectal cancer.31

In relation to CVD, elevated blood pressure has been
shown to be positively associated with higher intakes of
red and processed meat, even though the mechanism is
unclear, except that possibly meat may substitute for other
beneficial foods such as grains, fruits, or vegetables.32 Mean

terol, very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and tri-
glyceride levels were found to be decreased in subjects
who substituted red meat with fish.33,34 Vegetarians have
lower arachidonic, eicosapentaenoic, and docosahexae-
noic acid levels and higher linoleate and antioxidant lev-
els in platelet phospholipids; such a biochemical profile
may be related to decreased atherogenesis and throm-
bogenesis.34-36

Red and processed meat intakes, as well as a high-
risk meat diet, were associated with a modest increase
in risk of total mortality, cancer, and CVD mortality in
both men and women. In contrast, high white meat in-
take and a low-risk meat diet was associated with a small
decrease in total and cancer mortality. These results
complement the recommendations by the American In-
stitute for Cancer Research and the World Cancer Re-
search Fund to reduce red and processed meat intake to
decrease cancer incidence.31 Future research should in-
vestigate the relation between subtypes of meat and spe-
cific causes of mortality.
