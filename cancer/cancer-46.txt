Abstract

Background: Several lifestyle factors targeted by the American Cancer Society (ACS) Nutrition and Physical Activity

Cancer Prevention Guidelines are also associated with circulating concentrations of vitamin D metabolites. This suggests

that greater adherence to the ACS guidelines may be related to better vitamin D status.

Objective: We examined the relation between adherence to the ACS guidelines and circulating concentrations of
2 vitamin D metabolites, 25-hydroxycholecalciferol [25(OH)D] and 1a,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25(OH)2D].
Methods: We conducted cross-sectional analyses of pooled participants from the Wheat Bran Fiber (n = 503) and
Ursodeoxycholic Acid (n = 854) trials. A cumulative adherence score was constructed with the use of baseline data on

body size, diet, physical activity, and alcohol consumption. Continuous vitamin D metabolite concentrations and clinically

relevant categories were evaluated with the use of multiple linear and logistic regression models, respectively.

Results: The most adherent participants were more likely to be older, white, and nonsmokers than were the least adherent. A
statistically signiﬁcant association was observed between guideline adherence and concentrations of circulating 25(OH)D (means 6
SEs—high adherence: 32.0 6 0.8 ng/mL; low adherence: 26.4 6 0.7 ng/mL; P-trend < 0.001). For 1,25(OH)2D concentrations, high
adherence was again signiﬁcantly related to greater metabolite concentrations, with mean 6 SE concentrations of 36.3 6 1.3 pg/mL
and 31.9 6 1.0 pg/mL for high- and low-adherers, respectively (P-trend = 0.008). Furthermore, the odds of attaining a sufﬁcient

25(OH)D status were 4.37 times higher for those most adherent than for those least adherent (95% CI: 2.47, 7.71 times).

Conclusion: These ﬁndings demonstrate that greater adherence to the ACS guidelines is associated with higher
circulating concentrations of both of 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)2D. J Nutr 2017;147:421–9.

deﬁciency (1–7). Vitamin D deﬁciency has been linked
to several major causes of death,
including cardiovas-
cular disease, diabetes, and cancer (8). Although the de-
ﬁnition of clinical vitamin D deﬁciency has been updated
(9, 10),
the
optimal amount of vitamin D intake required to meet
deﬁnitions of vitamin D sufﬁciency also remains unclear
(12–14). Vitamin D supplementation with cholecalcif-
erol (vitamin D3) is the primary clinical strategy used to
increase circulating concentrations of 25-hydroxycholecalciferol

it remains debated (8, 11). Furthermore,

[25(OH)D]9, the metabolite most often measured to determine
vitamin D status in adults (15). However, studies of vitamin D
supplementation and health outcomes have produced equivocal
results (16, 17). In addition, there are emerging data that genetic
background may inﬂuence response to vitamin D supplementa-
tion (18, 19). Humans can also produce 25(OH)D via exposure
to UVB radiation (20), but this route is rarely promoted, because
excessive sunlight exposure can cause sunburns and increase the
risk of skin cancer (8). With regard to diet, naturally occurring
vitamin D is found in only a limited number of foods, such as
fatty ﬁsh, whereas vitamin D–fortiﬁed foods such as dairy
products, ready-to-eat cereals, and orange juice are more
common. Therefore, the optimal strategy for improving vitamin
D status remains equivocal.

Several lifestyle factors targeted by the American Cancer
Society (ACS) Nutrition and Physical Activity Cancer Prevention
Guidelines, including body size, diet, and physical activity, have
also been associated with circulating concentrations of vitamin
D (12, 21, 22). Our group recently completed a systematic
review that found strong and consistent evidence indicating that
adherence to the ACS or similar World Cancer Research
Fund/American Institute for Cancer Research guidelines was
associated with signiﬁcant reductions in cancer incidence and
mortality (23). One study included in the review by Kabat et al.
(24) reported a statistically signiﬁcant association between
higher adherence to the guidelines and increased melanoma
incidence. One explanation for these ﬁndings is that adherence
to the guidelines, particularly for physical activity, is related to
increased sun exposure and potentially higher vitamin D
concentrations. Thus, we hypothesized that greater adherence
to the guidelines would be associated with higher concentrations
of vitamin D metabolites. We used data from a pooled sample of
2 completed chemoprevention trials to construct an adherence
score for the ACS nutrition and physical activity cancer
prevention guidelines and assess the relation between adher-
ence and concentrations of 25(OH)D (n = 1357) and 1a,25-
dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25(OH)2D] (n = 854).

Methods

Study population. Data were pooled from 2 randomized, controlled,
double-blind, Phase III clinical trials conducted at the University of
Arizona Cancer Center from 1990 to 1999. These studies evaluated the
effect of either a wheat bran ﬁber (WBF) supplement (25, 26) or
ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) (27) on the development of a new
colorectal adenoma in patients with previously removed colorectal
adenomas. The present analyses were conducted with the use of data for
baseline diet, physical activity, and vitamin D biomarkers from the
pooled population. The University of Arizona Human Subjects Protec-
tion Program approved both studies. Written informed consent was
obtained from each participant before trial enrollment.

Recruitment and data collection. Phoenix and Tucson gastroenterol-
ogy practices served as recruitment centers from 1990 to 1995 for the
WBF supplement and 1995 to 1999 for the UDCA. Men (69.5%) and
women (30.5%) with a mean age of 65.5 y (range: 40–80 y) who had
$1 adenomas measuring $3 mm removed during a colonoscopy within a
6-mo period before study registration were included in the study. Mean 6
SD BMI (in kg/m2) was 28.3 6 4.2 and 27.7 6 5.5 for men and
women, respectively. Participants in the WBF supplement trial were
randomly assigned to a daily WBF supplement (13.5 g/d) or a low-ﬁber

supplement (2.0 g/d) (25). Participants in the UDCA trial were randomly
assigned to receive 8–10 mg UDCA/kg body weight or placebo daily (27).
Primary ﬁndings from the trials were null; neither the WBF supplement
nor the UDCA treatment prevented new colorectal adenomas (26, 27).
For the present cross-sectional analysis, participants from the pooled
sample (n = 3221) were excluded if they did not have serum 25(OH)D
data (n = 1253), had missing BMI data (n = 16), were underweight (BMI
<18.5) (n = 16), had unreliable dietary data (<600 kcal/d) (n = 14), had
missing baseline physical activity data (n = 544), or were missing any
other covariate included in the models (race, n = 16; education, n = 5).
The analytic cohort for 25(OH)D was thus composed of 1357 partici-
pants, whereas 1,25(OH)2D data were only available from the UDCA
trial (n = 854).

Analysis of serum vitamin D metabolites. Baseline vitamin D
metabolites were measured in a blinded fashion at Heartland Assays
(Ames) with the use of an established RIA (28). Quality-assurance and
-control measures, including pooled serum samples and duplicates in
different batches, were performed. The CV was <7.0% for 25(OH)D and
11.5% for 1,25(OH)2D. Serum 1,25(OH)2D was assessed as a contin-
uous variable and 25(OH)D was assessed as both a continuous and a
categorical variable,
in which clinically important categories were
deﬁned as deﬁcient (<20 ng/mL), insufﬁcient ($20 to <30 ng/mL), or
sufﬁcient ($30 ng/mL) (9, 10, 29–31).

Nutrition and physical activity cancer prevention guidelines
score. An a priori score was constructed based upon previously
published work by Thomson et al. (32) for adherence to the 2012 ACS
cancer prevention guidelines for nutrition and physical activity (33)
(Table 1). These guidelines focused on overall patterns of lifestyle
behaviors that included body size, physical activity, diet, and alcohol
consumption. Baseline diet and physical activity were collected with the
use of frequency questionnaires. The Arizona FFQ is a semiquantitative
175-item validated questionnaire that asks respondents to report how
often (per day, week, or month) and how much (small, medium, or large
usual portion) participants consumed each food item over the previous
12-mo period (34). The Arizona Activity Frequency Questionnaire is a
59-item validated questionnaire that groups physical activity by leisure,
recreational, household, and other activity categories (35). The provided
output contains metabolic equivalent task (MET) units per day and per
activity, kilojoules, number of hours per day per activity, and number of
activities reported by respondents for each category, which were used to
generate the physical activity score. Each ACS recommendation was
equally weighted 0–2 points. Zero points were allocated for not meeting
the recommendation at all, 1 point for partially meeting the recommen-
dation, and 2 points for fully meeting the recommendation. The overall
score, summed from individual recommendations, ranged from 0 for
those participants who were not adherent at all to the recommendations
to 8 for those participants who were fully adherent to all 4 lifestyle factor
recommendations. Adherence categories were deﬁned as low (0–2
points), moderate (3–5 points), and high (6–8 points). The recommen-
dations for each lifestyle factor, how they were measured, how scores
were assigned based upon the guidelines, and the proportion of the study
population within each category are outlined in Table 1. Smoking status
was not included in the ACS adherence scoring, but was included as a
potential confounder in the current analyses.

The ﬁrst recommendation to ‘‘maintain a healthy weight throughout
life’’ was scored based upon calculated BMI from height and weight
reported at baseline. The best score (2 points) was given to those with a
BMI within normal range (18.5–25), 1 point was given those in the
overweight range (25–30), and 0 points were given to those in the obese
category (>30.0). Underweight participants (<18.5) were excluded from
the present analysis.

The second recommendation to ‘‘adopt a physically active lifestyle’’
was evaluated by MET (36) scores from the Arizona FFQ recreational
activities section. Any participant doing less than the minimum
recommendation [30 min on 5 d (2.5 h/wk) of moderate activity (3.5
METs) was equal to 8.75 MET-h/wk] received a score of 0 points. One
hour per day, 5 d/wk (5.0 h/wk), of moderate activity (3.5 METs)
equaled 17.5 MET-h/wk. Therefore, 8.75–17.5 MET-h/wk earned a

score of 1 point. Participants meeting preferable levels, >17.5 MET-
h/wk, earned a score of 2 points.

The third recommendation to ‘‘consume a healthy diet with an
emphasis on plant sources’’ was assessed with 3 separate diet scores that
were constructed and summed to capture the recommended dietary
pattern. The ﬁrst diet score for the recommendation ‘‘eat 5 or more
servings of a variety of vegetables and fruits each day’’ was assigned
1 point for meeting the recommended number of servings ($2.5
cups), which were measured from the food group categories fruits,
fruit juice, vegetables, and vegetable juice. An additional 1 or 2
points were assigned for diet quality based upon being in the second
or third sex-speciﬁc tertile of total carotenoids, respectively, which
included b-carotene, a-carotene, b-cryptoxanthin, lycopene, and lutein
plus zeaxanthin combined. The second diet score for the recommendation
‘‘choose whole grains in preference to processed (reﬁned) grains’’ was
evaluated by the percentage of grains consumed as whole grains. Points
were assigned by the sex-speciﬁc quartile distribution with the highest
quartile receiving 3 points and lowest quartile receiving 0 points. The third
diet score for the recommendation ‘‘limit consumption of processed
and red meats’’ was measured similarly to the whole grains assessed
by sex-speciﬁc quartile distribution. However, the lowest quartile
received 3 points and the highest quartile received 0 points. The 3 diet

scores were summed for a potential total of 9 points. Dietary pattern
scores were further collapsed into 0 points (0–2 summed diet scores),
1 point (3–6 summed diet scores), and 2 points (7–9 summed diet scores).
The fourth recommendation used in this analysis was ‘‘if you drink
alcohol, limit consumption to 1 drink/d for women or 2 drinks/d for
men.’’ Alcohol was captured in the Arizona FFQ in terms of total grams
of alcohol per day. One drink was estimated as 14 g alcohol or
approximately one 12-ounce regular beer, 5-ounce glass of wine, or 1.5-
ounce shot of 80-proof distilled spirit (37). Nondrinkers were assigned 2
points, moderate drinkers who consumed the limit or less were assigned
1 point, and heavy drinkers who consumed more than the limit were
assigned 0 points.

Statistical analysis. Descriptive statistics were generated for vitamin D
metabolites, adherence scores, and demographic variables. Means and
SEs were estimated for continuous variables and percentages were
calculated for the categorical variables.

Multiple linear regression models were used to assess the relations
between adherence score categories and circulating concentrations of 25
(OH)D and 1,25(OH)2D. Estimated mean concentrations of 25(OH)D
and 1,25(OH)2D for individuals in the reference categories were
centered on mean age and energy intake of the strata with the use of

linear combinations of variables. Reference categories were selected to
represent the majority of the pooled sample (white, male, not a college
graduate, and nonsmoker in the UDCA trial). Associations between
adherence scores and clinically signiﬁcant categories for serum 25(OH)D
were evaluated with the use of multinomial logistic regression models
to estimate ORs. Individual adherence score components were also
examined for associations with adjusted mean concentrations of 25
(OH)D and 1,25(OH)2D. Regression modeling was also used to
calculate P-trend. Potential confounders included age, education, race,
smoking status, supplement use, season of blood draw, and energy
intake (21, 22, 38–40). A covariate was considered to be a confounder if
it changed the measure of association by $10% when included in a
regression model (41). To assess whether the associations between
adherence score and vitamin D metabolites were modiﬁed by sex or
study, likelihood ratio tests were used to determine whether there was a
difference in the log-likelihoods from models with and without interac-
tion terms. Statistical signiﬁcance was determined at an a level of 0.05.
Data from the trials were merged and managed with the use of Stata
version 14.1.

Results

More women than men met the BMI recommendation of a
healthy body size (18.5–25), whereas more men than women
met preferable physical activity levels of >1 h/d, 5 d/wk (>5.0
h/wk) of moderate activity (3.5 METs), or >17.5 MET-h/wk
total (Table 1). Men and women had similar adherence to diet
recommendations overall; however, a greater percentage of
women were nondrinkers at baseline than men. Baseline
characteristics of men and women by category of adherence

score are shown in Table 2. In general, participants in the most
adherent overall category of adherence score (6–8 points) were
more likely to be older, white, and nonsmokers than were
participants in the least adherent category (0–2 points).

Adjusted mean circulating 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)2D con-
centrations for each adherence score category from multivariate
linear regression models for individuals in reference categories
(white, male, not a college graduate, nonsmoker in the UDCA
trial) centered on mean age and energy intake are shown in Table
3. In the pooled sample, those in the highest adherence category
to the ACS guidelines (6–8 points) had a mean 6 SE 25(OH)D
concentration of 32.0 6 0.8 ng/mL and a mean 6 SE 1,25
(OH)2D concentration of 36.3 6 1.3 pg/mL, with signiﬁcant
dose-dependent trends for both metabolites (P-trend < 0.001
and P-trend < 0.008, respectively) (Table 3). For 25(OH)D,
there were no statistically signiﬁcant
interactions for sex
(P-interaction = 0.42) or study (P-interaction = 0.19). Study
interaction was not evaluated for 1,25(OH)2D, because it was
only available for the UDCA study. There was no statistically
signiﬁcant interaction between score and sex (P-interaction = 0.86)
for 1,25(OH)2D.

The results of multinomial logistic regression models for
the association between categories of adherence scores and
clinically-deﬁned categories of 25(OH)D are presented in Table
4. The odds of having an insufﬁcient vitamin D status
($20 ng/mL and <30 ng/mL) compared with a deﬁcient status
(<20 ng/mL) were 1.76 times greater (95% CI: 1.21, 2.57) for
those who had moderate adherence to the guidelines and 2.29
times greater (95% CI: 1.35, 3.90) for individuals who had high

adherence compared with those with low adherence. The odds
of having a sufﬁcient vitamin D status ($30 ng/mL) compared
with a deﬁcient status were 2.41 times greater (95% CI: 1.58,
3.68) for those achieving moderate adherence and 4.37 times
greater (95% CI: 2.47, 7.71) for those who had high adherence
compared with those within the lowest adherence category.

Adjusted mean concentrations of 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)2D
for individuals in the reference categories (white male, not a
college graduate, and a nonsmoker in the UDCA trial) by
adherence score components are displayed in Table 5. An inverse
relation between BMI categories and both 25(OH)D and 1,25
(OH)2D exhibited a dose-dependent trend (both comparisons,
P-trend < 0.001). Similarly, a signiﬁcant trend was seen for
higher levels of physical activity and higher concentrations of
both vitamin D metabolites (P-trend < 0.001). In contrast, any
association or trend between diet component and either vitamin
D metabolite was less clear. A diet score of 1 point was
signiﬁcantly associated with 25(OH)D with a signiﬁcant overall
trend (P-trend = 0.039). No signiﬁcant association was observed
between diet score and 1,25(OH)2D. A signiﬁcant trend was
seen for increasing alcohol consumption and increasing concen-
trations of both 25(OH)D (P-trend = 0.009) and 1,25(OH)2D
(P-trend = 0.040).

Discussion

Greater adherence to nutrition and physical activity cancer
prevention guidelines that have been developed by the ACS and
other leading cancer organizations has been found to be
associated with a reduced risk of overall cancer incidence and
mortality,
including some site-speciﬁc cancers (23). These
guidelines are consistent with recommendations for the pre-
vention of other major diseases as well, and, if followed,

are associated with healthier lives overall (42–44). To our
knowledge, no studies have assessed the relation between ACS
guidelines for cancer prevention and circulating concentrations of
vitamin D metabolites, which are biomarkers often linked
to health outcomes (45). This current work offers evidence
indicating that greater adherence to an overall lifestyle pattern as
outlined by the ACS nutrition and physical activity cancer
prevention guidelines is associated with higher concentrations of
both 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)2D, based on a pooled sample of
participants enrolled in one of 2 chemoprevention trials in
Arizona. Furthermore, signiﬁcant dose-dependent trends were
seen for BMI, physical activity, and alcohol intake and both
vitamin D metabolites. The lack of signiﬁcant association between
diet adherence scores and vitamin D was not unexpected, because
the fruit, vegetable, grain, and red and processed meat variables
included in the diet adherence score are not considered to be
substantial dietary sources of vitamin D. The relation between
alcohol intake and higher circulating concentrations of vitamin D
has been reported previously, with suggestions of residual
confounding or heavier consumers of alcohol having lifestyles
favorable to higher concentrations of circulating vitamin D (46,
47). To our knowledge, there is no clear biological mechanism,
and this warrants further investigation.

Concentrations of 25(OH)D can vary from many nonmodiﬁ-
able factors, such as skin pigmentation, sex, genetic background, and
season (30, 40). However, 25(OH)D also varies from modiﬁable
factors, such as amount of sun exposure, dietary intake, and
supplementation (20). Sun exposure increases vitamin D production,
but also can cause skin damage or even skin cancer, the risk of which
varies according to skin pigmentation and possibly body size (48,
49). Compared with normal-weight adults, obese adults have been
found to have signiﬁcantly lower concentrations of the vitamin D
metabolite 25(OH)D, possibly because of lower dietary intake or

lesser exposure of skin to sunlight, volumetric dilution, or seques-
tration in adipose tissue (49–51). Healthy-weight adults with
higher levels of physical activity are more likely to meet DRIs for
vitamin D and other micronutrients than are overweight adults
(52). Furthermore, several studies have suggested that obese
adults may need higher doses of supplementation than
normal do weight adults to achieve sufﬁcient 25(OH)D
status (12, 53).

A recent review of vitamin D supplementation trials estimates
that 2990 IU/d is required to surpass deﬁcient concentrations
(20 ng/mL) of serum 25(OH)D in 97.5% of healthy individuals
(13). The RDA for healthy adults aged 19–70 y is 600 IU, and it
is 800 IU for those >70 y of age (1). However, it has been
suggested that these recommendations have been miscalculated,
are too low, and should be reconsidered (14). The means and
SDs of 25(OH)D for selected large vitamin-D supplementation
trials (54–60) presented in the review by Veugelers et al. (13), as
well as a trial conducted by our group (57), are presented in
Table 6. Three studies used dosages of 400 IU/d with follow-up
times of 4, 48, and 108 wk, resulting in mean 6 SD 25(OH)D
concentrations of 28.3 6 8.9 ng/mL in healthy men and women
(57), and 36.9 6 9.5 ng/mL (56) and 24.4 6 12.2 ng/mL (60) in
2 separate studies of postmenopausal women. Dosages of 800
IU/d were used in 2 trials with a range of follow-up times from
13 to 156 wk, resulting in mean 6 SD 25(OH)D concentrations
of 28.39 6 9.18 ng/mL and 29.91 6 8.78 ng/mL in women (54,
58). In a study that evaluated the effect of a daily dose of 1000 IU
in preventing new colorectal adenomas, healthy non-Hispanic
white subjects aged 45–75 y had mean 6 SD concentrations of
31.5 6 8.9 ng/mL after 1 y (55). Comparably in our study,
moderate and high adherence to the ACS guidelines demon-
strated mean 6 SD concentrations of 25(OH)D of 29.6 6
0.5 ng/mL and 32.0 6 0.8 ng/mL, respectively. Therefore,
following the ACS guidelines could potentially increase 25(OH)
D concentrations as much as or more than a supplement of 1000 IU/d.
Improving vitamin D status through lifestyle modiﬁcations as
opposed to supplementation allows for a strategy that would
avoid any potential toxicity, such as renal calciﬁcations (16), and
is likely to incur other health beneﬁts as well.

Less is known about lifestyle factors that may be associated
with circulating concentrations of 1,25(OH)2D (61). Few epi-
demiologic studies have evaluated the association between
1,25(OH)2D and physical activity. One examined the effects of
long-term aerobic exercise and v-3 supplementation on bone
health in postmenopausal women and found that 1,25(OH)2D
increased with the intervention (62). Similarly, in a study within
the UDCA cohort included in the present study, moderate to
vigorous physical activity was positively associated with 1,25
(OH)2D, with women experiencing the greatest increase (21).
Hibler et al. (21) suggested that the association between physical
activity and vitamin D may be beyond sun exposure and driven

by the role of 1,25(OH)2D in bone health. It is also possible that
increased physical activity exerts an effect on metabolism that
itself results in higher production of vitamin D metabolites;
however, any biological mechanism would be speculative at this
time. BMI, the measure used to estimate body size in our study,
has a well-known inverse relation with 25(OH)D, but evidence
of its relation with 1,25(OH)2D is limited. A statistically
signiﬁcant association between higher circulating concentrations
of 1,25(OH)2D and a lower risk of metabolic syndrome, which
consists of waist circumference, TGs, blood pressure, glucose,
and HDL cholesterol, was also reported in a sample population
from the UDCA and WBF supplement cohorts (63).

In addition,

The major strengths of

the current study include the
availability of data from a prospective cohort of >1300
participants with complete data on a wide range of available
baseline nutrition, physical activity, and serum vitamin D
metabolite data. However, even though the original trials were
prospective cohorts,
this secondary data analysis is cross-
sectional in nature, with measurements coming from baseline
assessments. Furthermore, only one measure of 25(OH)D was
used for the assessment of vitamin D status, although previous
ﬁndings suggest that single baseline 25(OH)D measurements
provide reasonably representative measures of the biomarker
(64).
the ‘‘maintenance of a healthy weight
throughout life’’ ACS guideline could not be precisely assessed
because height and weight data were not available for earlier
periods in life. Although the instruments used to collect lifestyle
data asked for usual dietary consumption in the previous 12-mo
period and the last 4 wk for physical activity, the reported
behaviors may not be representative of the participantsÕ longer-
term behaviors. Participants in this study had already had a
colorectal adenoma removed, and may have changed their
lifestyle habits after removal of their adenoma, which had to
have occurred within the previous 6 mo before study enrollment,
thus affecting the generalizability of the results. Although self-
reports of physical activity and dietary and alcohol intake are
susceptible to measurement error or misclassiﬁcation bias, the
frequency questionnaires used had been validated in the study
sample. There is also the potential issue that the various healthy
behaviors included in the ACS adherence score may cluster in
individuals, making it difﬁcult to separate the effect of the score
components. Finally, circulating concentrations of vitamin D
metabolites may merely be a biomarker of risk, or, in this case,
an overall lifestyle pattern, and not necessarily a mechanism of
action for disease risk (40). Nonetheless, these ﬁndings indicate
the potential for increasing concentrations of vitamin D when
the overall guidelines are more closely followed.

In summary, there remains a great deal of debate regarding
vitamin D status and the strategy for best achieving sufﬁcient
concentrations, including the use and dosing of supplements.
Our results suggest that following an overall pattern of healthy
behaviors as recommended in the ACS Nutrition and Physical
Activity Cancer Prevention guidelines may be associated with
higher concentrations of both 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)2D. In
addition, score components also demonstrated signiﬁcant asso-
ciations. Therefore, close adherence to the ACS nutrition and
physical activity cancer prevention guidelines may be a viable
public health strategy for increasing both 25(OH)D and 1,25
(OH)2D concentrations.
