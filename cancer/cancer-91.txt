ABSTRACT
Background: Nut consumption has been associated with decreased
risk of colorectal, endometrial, lung, and pancreatic cancers. Polyphe-
nols, ﬁber, vitamins, and minerals in nuts may confer this observed
protective effect. To our knowledge, no prospective study has evaluated
the effect of nut consumption on esophageal and gastric cancers.
Objective: The objective was to evaluate the associations between
nut and peanut butter consumption and the risk of esophageal and
gastric cancers and their different subtypes.
Design: In this study we used data from the NIH-AARP Diet and
Health Study, which enrolled 566,407 persons who were 50–71 y
old at baseline (1995–1996). The median follow-up time was 15.5 y.
Intakes of nuts and peanut butter were assessed through the use of a
validated food-frequency questionnaire. We used Cox proportional
hazard models to estimate HRs and 95% CIs for esophageal and
gastric cancers and their subtypes.
Results: We identiﬁed 966 incident cases of esophageal adenocar-
cinomas, 323 cases of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, 698
cases of gastric cardia adenocarcinoma, and 732 cases of gastric
noncardia adenocarcinoma. Compared with those who did not con-
sume nuts or peanut butter [lowest category of consumption (C0)],
participants in the highest category of nut consumption (C3) had a
lower risk of developing gastric noncardia adenocarcinoma [C3
compared with C0, HR: 0.73 (95% CI: 0.57, 0.94)]. This inverse
association was also seen for peanut butter consumption [C3 com-
pared with C0, HR: 0.75 (95% CI: 0.60, 0.94)]. We observed no
signiﬁcant associations between the highest and lowest intakes of nuts
or peanut butter and the risk of gastric cardia adenocarcinoma,
esophageal adenocarcinoma, or esophageal squamous cell carci-
noma.
Conclusions: Among older American adults, both nut and peanut
butter consumption were inversely associated with the risk of gastric
noncardia adenocarcinoma. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.
gov as NCT00340015.

INTRODUCTION

Gastric cancer is the third and esophageal cancer the sixth most
common cause of death from cancer worldwide (1). Gastric

cancer has 2 subtypes, gastric cardia cancer and gastric noncardia
cancer. Esophageal cancer also has 2 subtypes, adenocarcinoma
and squamous cell carcinoma, which have distinct causes (2, 3).
The incidence of gastric cardia adenocarcinoma and esophageal
adenocarcinoma is increasing in the United States and some other
Western countries, whereas the incidence of gastric noncardia
adenocarcinoma and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma is
decreasing (4); this warrants separate evaluations of the risk
factors for these subtypes.

Nuts have been shown to have anti-inﬂammatory effects by
affecting the production of prostaglandins and cytokines (5), and
antioxidative effects by decreasing lipid peroxidation and pro-
tecting against oxidative DNA damage (6). These protective
effects could be due to some components of nuts, including
polyphenols, ﬁbers, vitamins, and minerals (7). In some studies,
nut consumption has been associated with decreased total and
cancer-speciﬁc mortalities (6, 8–11). Also, a few studies have
reported inverse associations with speciﬁc cancer sites,
in-
cluding the colon and rectum, endometrium, lungs, and pancreas
(12, 13). Case-control studies have reported conﬂicting results
(14, 15), and to our knowledge no study has prospectively
evaluated the effect of nut consumption on upper gastrointestinal
cancers. In addition, while 50% of the peanuts consumed in the
United States take the form of peanut butter (16), just one
previous publication reported the association of peanut butter
with colorectal cancer incidence in the Nurses’ Health Study
(17).

In this analysis, we investigated the association between nut
and peanut butter consumption and the risk of esophageal and

Survey of Food Intakes by Individuals (20).

METHODS

Study setting and population

The NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study was established in
1995–1996; 3.5 million members of AARP were mailed a
baseline questionnaire that queried demographic characteristics,
dietary intake, and other health-related factors. Eligible partic-
ipants were 50–71 y old and resided in California, Florida,
Louisiana, New Jersey, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, or either
of 2 metropolitan areas (Atlanta, Georgia, or Detroit, Michigan).
The details of the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study have been
described previously (18).

In total, 617,119 baseline questionnaires were returned (18%
response rate). After excluding subjects who moved out of the
registry ascertainment area, those who later requested to be re-
moved from the study, and those who returned incomplete
questionnaires, the cohort comprised 566,398 participants. For
this analysis we excluded 1) proxy respondents (n = 15,760); 2)
participants with a self-reported history of cancer other than
nonmelanoma skin cancer, prevalent cancer, or cancer diagnosed
only on a death certiﬁcate (n = 51,334); 3) participants outside 2
times the interquartile range (25th to 75th percentile) of the
normalized distribution for energy intake (n = 4415); 4) those
who self-reported end-stage renal disease at baseline (n = 997);
and 5) participants with missing information on nut consump-
tion (n = 8267) or peanut butter consumption (n = 6815). This
analysis contains 2 substantially overlapping data sets: one for
nut consumption, which consists of 485,625 participants, and
one for peanut butter consumption, which consists of 487,077
participants.

The NIH-AARP Diet and Health study was approved by the
Special Studies Institutional Review Board of the US National
Cancer Institute, and all participants provided written informed
consent.

Exposure assessment

A baseline food-frequency questionnaire (FFQ) was self-
administered and queried intake of 124 items over the pre-
vious 12 mo. The NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study FFQ has
been shown to be valid and reproducible (19). Nut consumption
was deﬁned as consumption of “peanuts, walnuts, seeds or other
nuts” and was assessed through the use of 10 frequency cate-
gories, ranging from never to $2 times/d, and 3 portion size
categories, including less than one-quarter cup, a quarter to a
half-cup, and “more than a half cup.” According to the USDA
nutrient database, a quarter cup of nuts weighs 32.75 g. Peanut
butter consumption was assessed with the same frequency cat-
egories, but the portion sizes of peanut butter consisted of 3
different options: ,1, 1–2, and .2 tablespoons. According to
the USDA nutrient database, 1 tablespoon of peanut butter
weighs 16 g. Grams of nuts and peanut butter consumed daily
were computed through the use of frequency and portion size
data. Energy and nutrient intakes were calculated by linking

Ascertainment of endpoints

Incident cases of gastroesophageal cancers were identiﬁed by
linking to 11 state cancer registry databases (the 8 original states
and 3 additional ones: Arizona, Nevada, and Texas). A previous
study found that the sensitivity and speciﬁcity of case identiﬁ-
cation in the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study cohort were
89.2% and 99.5%, respectively (21). Addresses of subjects were
linked annually to the US Postal Service National Change of
Address database to aid follow-up. Vital status was identiﬁed
through linkages to the National Death Index, linkages to state
cancer registries, and responses to annual mailings.

Cancer subtypes were determined based on the histologic
codes of the International Classiﬁcation of Diseases for Oncology
(ICD-O), Third Edition, as well as anatomic site (22). We
identiﬁed subjects with esophageal cancer with site codes C150–
C159. Then we classiﬁed them by histology type and identiﬁed
966 incident cases of esophageal adenocarcinomas and 323 in-
cident cases of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. We ex-
cluded cases with nonadenocarcinoma or nonsquamous (n = 83)
and unspeciﬁed (n = 39) histologies. We identiﬁed 698 incident
cases of gastric cardia adenocarcinoma (site code 160) and 732
incident cases of gastric noncardia adenocarcinoma (site codes
161–169). Cases with nonadenocarcinoma histology (n = 183)
were excluded because the risk factors for these malignancies
are different.

Statistical analysis

Nut and peanut butter consumptions were tabulated for known
and suspected risk factors for gastric and esophageal cancers. The
correlation between nut consumption and peanut butter con-
sumption was determined with Spearman correlation tests. Cox
proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate
HRs and 95% CIs. The proportional hazards assumption was
veriﬁed through the use of the Schoenfeld residuals test for either
nut or peanut butter consumption. Person-years were used as the
underlying time metric and were computed from the date of
receipt of a valid baseline questionnaire to the date of diagnosis of
gastric, esophageal, or head and neck cancer (individuals with
these cancers are more susceptible to gastroesophageal cancers);
the date of departing the catchment area or loss to follow-up; the
date of death; or the end of the follow-up period (31 December
2011), whichever occurred ﬁrst.

For adjusted models, we investigated all suspected con-
founders, including age, sex, smoking status and dose (never,
former ,20 cigarettes/d,
former $20 cigarettes/d, current
,20 cigarettes/d, or current $20 cigarettes/d), alcohol drinking
(grams per day), BMI (kg/m2), education (less than high school,
completed high school, post-high school or some college, or
college and postgraduate), leisure physical activity (never, rarely,
1–3 times/mo, 1–2 times/wk, 3–4 times/wk, $5 times/wk), fruit
and vegetable intake (servings per day), and calorie intake
(kilocalories per day). For energy adjustment, we used a nutrition
density model based on grams per 1000-kcal intake, in addition to
including energy in the models (23). Ethnicity (non-Hispanic
white; non-Hispanic black; Hispanic; or Asian, Paciﬁc Islander, or

Native American) was included in the model only for noncardia
gastric adenocarcinoma because .95% of participants with all
other cancers were non-Hispanic white.

Multivariate HRs were calculated for categories of nut and
peanut butter consumption. Because a large percentage of the
population reported never consuming nuts or peanut butter during
the previous 12 mo, we used never consumers as the reference
category and categorized ever-consumers into tertiles based on
the grams of nuts they consumed per 1000 kcal. The median value
of each category was used to assess linear trend. HRs for the
continuous scale were reported for each one-quarter-cup increase
in nut consumption and each 1-tablespoon increase in peanut
butter consumption per 1000 kcal/d.

We performed several secondary analyses. We used the
frequency of nut and peanut butter consumption to compare the
risk of each cancer between participants who never or almost
never (1–6 times/y) ate nuts or peanut butter, and participants
who reported frequently consuming nuts or peanut butter. We
also examined total nut consumption (grams) by adding the
amount of nuts to the amount of peanut butter reported on the
FFQ by each participant (24). To minimize the effect of healthy
eating, an additional analysis further adjusted for the Healthy
Eating Index 2010 (HEI 2010), because nut consumption could
be a marker of healthy eating. To control for the effects of
MUFAs and PUFAs, additional analyses further adjusted for
MUFA and PUFA intake. Mutual adjustment was done for nut
and peanut butter consumption. To accommodate the possible
confounding of socioeconomic status, we performed a strati-
ﬁed analysis. We excluded from sensitivity analyses cases di-
agnosed in the ﬁrst 2 y of follow-up in order to assess potential
reverse causality. Finally, to minimize misclassiﬁcation, we
excluded participants with ICD-O codes C168 and C169; the
C168 code designates lesions of the stomach that overlap
different anatomic areas, and the C169 code designates gas-
tric adenocarcinoma without a speciﬁc location within the
stomach.

Using likelihood ratio tests, we also evaluated interactions
between never or almost never nut or peanut butter consumption
with age, sex, BMI, smoking status, smoking dose, alcohol
drinking, education, and total energy consumption. We used the
median of continuous variables to categorize them for evaluating
interactions. The signiﬁcance cutoff for the interaction likelihood
ratio test was P , 0.05. Statistical analyses were done with
STATA software (version 13; STATA Corp). All P values were
2-sided, and P , 0.05 was considered signiﬁcant.

RESULTS

The median (IQR) follow-up time was 15.5 y (13.5–15.6 y).
The median age of the participants was 62.6 y, 59.6% were
male, and 91.2% were non-Hispanic white. The mean intake of
nut consumption was 2.8 6 8.4 g/d, and the mean intake of
peanut butter consumption was 3.0 6 7.4 g/d. The correlation
between nut consumption and peanut butter consumption was
0.20 (P , 0.001).

In general, nut consumers were more likely to be male, drink
more alcohol, have more education, be more active, and consume
more calories; they were less likely to smoke or to have a history
of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, or hypertension (Table 1).
Suspected risk factors were less different among subjects in the

categories of peanut butter consumption. However, peanut butter
consumers were more likely to be smokers, be more active,
have a higher BMI, consume more calories, drink less alcohol,
have less education, and be less likely to have a history of heart
disease and hypertension, according to their reports (Table 1).
The associations between nut consumption and each outcome
are summarized in Table 2. Being in the highest category of nut
consumption was associated with a statistically signiﬁcant lower
risk of developing gastric noncardia adenocarcinoma com-
pared with non-consumers [HR: 0.73 (95% CI: 0.57, 0.94)].
However, no signiﬁcant association was found between every
quarter-cup (per 1000 kcal/d) increase in the consumption of
nuts and risk of gastric noncardia adenocarcinoma [HR: 0.73
(95% CI: 0.32, 1.64)] (Table 2). We observed no signiﬁcant
associations between nut consumption and risk of gastric cardia
cancer, esophageal adenocarcinoma, or esophageal squamous
cell carcinoma (Table 2).

The associations between peanut butter consumption and each
outcome are summarized in Table 3. Being in the highest peanut
butter consumption group was associated with a statistically
signiﬁcant
lower risk of gastric noncardia adenocarcinoma
compared with those who did not consume peanut butter [HR:
0.75 (95% CI: 0.60, 0.94)]. We also observed a signiﬁcant 48%
decreased risk of gastric noncardia adenocarcinoma for every 1
tablespoon (per 1000 kcal/d) of peanut butter consumed [HR:
0.52 (95% CI: 0.32, 0.84)] (Table 3). The P-trend for the risk of
esophageal adenocarcinoma was statistically signiﬁcant. How-
ever, neither the HR of the highest (C3) versus the lowest (C0)
category of nut consumption nor the HR of continuous intake for
esophageal adenocarcinoma was signiﬁcant (Table 3).

Eating nuts was associated with an 18% lower risk of de-
veloping gastric noncardia adenocarcinoma than reporting never
or almost never eating nuts [HR: 0.82 (95% CI: 0.70, 0.95)].
Eating peanut butter was associated with a 28% lower risk of
developing esophageal squamous cell carcinoma [HR: 0.72
(95% CI: 0.56, 0.91)] and a 19% lower risk of developing gastric
noncardia adenocarcinoma [HR: 0.81 (95% CI: 0.69, 0.94)] than
never or almost never eating peanut butter.

We also examined the association between total nut intake
(nuts and peanut butter together, grams per 1000 kcal/d) and risk
of each cancer subtype. Total nut intake was inversely associated
with the risk of gastric noncardia cancer [C3 compared with C0,
HR: 0.66 (95% CI: 0.53, 0.82)]. Total nut intake was not sta-
tistically signiﬁcantly associated with the other 3 cancer subtypes
(data not shown).

In additional analyses, including the HEI 2010 in the Cox
proportional hazards regression model shifted the results of
gastric noncardia adenocarcinoma toward the null, but the pro-
tective effect remained signiﬁcant for nut [C3 compared with C0,
HR: 0.76 (95% CI: 0.59, 0.99)] and peanut butter [C3 compared
with C0, HR: 0.79 (95% CI: 0.63, 0.99)] consumption. Including
HEI 2010 in the model did not change the results for the other
cancer subtypes. When including monounsaturated fat intake in
the model, the association between peanut butter consumption
and the risk of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma became
signiﬁcant [C3 compared with C0, HR: 0.69 (95% CI: 0.49,
0.98)], but this did not change the results for the other cancers.
Including polyunsaturated fat intake in the model did not sig-
niﬁcantly change any of the results. Adjusting the models for self-
reported history of heart disease, diabetes, and stroke did not

1 Intake density is based on grams per 1000 kcal. C, category.
2 Adjusted for age (years), sex (male or female), smoking status and dose (never, former ,20 cigarettes/d, former $20 cigarettes/d, current
,20 cigarettes/d, or current $20 cigarettes/d), alcohol drinking (grams per day), BMI (kg/m2), education (less than high school, completed high school,
post-high school or some college, or college and postgraduate), physical activity (never, rarely, 1–3 times/mo, 1–2 times/wk, 3–4 times/wk, or $5 times/wk), fruit
and vegetable intake (servings per day), and calories (kilocalories per day). HRs (95% CIs) were calculated through the use of a Cox regression model.

3 Additionally adjusted for ethnicity (non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Hispanic, or Asian/Paciﬁc Islander/Native American). HRs (95% CIs)

were calculated through the use of a Cox regression model.

signiﬁcantly change the results of any subtype, and the inverse
association with gastric noncardia adenocarcinoma remained
signiﬁcant for nut [C3 compared with C0, HR: 0.73 (95% CI:
0.56, 0.95)] and peanut butter [C3 compared with C0, HR: 0.76
(95% CI: 0.62, 0.96)] consumption. Mutual adjustment for nut
and peanut butter consumption did not alter the results. In
sensitivity analyses, excluding the ﬁrst 2 y of follow-up did not
change the results (Supplemental Table 1). Excluding cases
with ICD-O codes C168 and C169 (w36% of the noncardia
gastric cancer cases) shifted the point estimates for nut con-
sumption [C3 compared with C0, HR: 0.89 (95% CI: 0.64,
1.25)] and peanut butter consumption [C3 compared with C0,
HR: 0.81 (95% CI: 0.61, 1.07)] toward the null and made these
associations nonsigniﬁcant (Supplemental Table 1).

When stratifying by level of education, the protective effect on
gastric noncardia adenocarcinoma seemed to be more prominent in
those at the more extreme levels of education; however, the dif-
ferences were not signiﬁcant and should be interpreted as equal.
No statistical interaction was found between level of education and
nut intake (P-interaction = 0.33). We found no evidence of a
statistical interaction between nut or peanut butter consumption
and any of the other factors evaluated (data not shown).

DISCUSSION

In this large prospective cohort study, nut and peanut butter
consumption were inversely associated with the risk of noncardia
gastric cancer in a dose-dependent manner. To our knowledge,
this is the ﬁrst prospective study to assess the association between
nut and peanut butter consumption and the risk of esophageal and
stomach cancers.

A few studies have shown an inverse association between nut
consumption and speciﬁc cancer sites, including the colon, en-
dometrium, and pancreas (12). In a population-based case-
control study in Japan, subjects who ate nuts $3 times/mo
had a 50% lower risk of gastric cancer than never consumers
[OR: 0.5 (95% CI: 0.3, 0.7)], and a signiﬁcant trend was ob-
served in the protective effect across categories of nut con-
sumption (14), which is consistent with our results. In another
case-control study in Greece investigating the role of diet in the
cause of gastric cancer, cases reported signiﬁcantly more fre-
quent consumption of beans and nuts (15). In a case-control
study investigating the Mediterranean diet and risk of upper
aerodigestive tract cancers, including esophageal cancer, nut
consumption was not signiﬁcantly associated with the risk of
these cancers (25). All of these studies were case-control studies
and thus were more likely to be subject to recall bias than our
prospective study.

To our knowledge, no previous study has evaluated the as-
sociation between peanut butter and the risk of gastroesophageal
cancer. Yang et al. (17) reported no association between peanut
butter and colorectal cancer risk in the Nurses’ Health Study.
Peanut butter consumption was not associated with cancer
mortality in the Southern Community Cohort Study (n = 71,764)
in the southeastern United States, although this study had a
relatively short follow-up (5.4 y) (24). Peanut butter consump-
tion was not related to total mortality or cancer mortality in the
Netherlands Cohort Study (8). However, the mean consumption
of peanut butter in the Netherlands cohort (1.3 g/d) was less than
half the mean consumption in our population (3 g/d).

Although nut consumers and peanut butter consumers seemed
to be different with regard to several baseline characteristics,

including alcohol intake, smoking, and amount of education
(which are all potential risk factors for gastric cancer), a pro-
tective effect of consumption was observed in both, which
suggests that confounding by these other factors was not driving
the observed associations. We found no signiﬁcant differences by
education level in a stratiﬁed analysis. However, as in all ob-
servational studies, we cannot rule out the possibility that residual
confounding was caused by other factors, including socioeco-
nomic status.

Evidence suggests that some components of nuts—namely,
phytosterols, ﬁber, MUFAs, vitamins, and minerals—may pro-
tect against cancer (12, 26). Phytosterols, including polyphenols
in walnuts and quercetin in almonds, can inhibit carcinogenesis
and prevent oxidative stress (27). Polyphenols regulate the in-
ﬂammatory response by affecting the production of prosta-
glandins and cytokines (5). Peanuts contain resveratrol, which
has anticarcinogenic and antioxidative effects (28). Nuts are
also a good source of vitamins such as folate, niacin, carotenoid,
and vitamin E, and of minerals such as calcium, selenium, zinc,
and magnesium (8), which may protect against gastroesopha-
geal cancers (26, 29–31). Nuts contain high concentrations of
MUFAs and variable amounts of PUFAs (32). A recent study
showed that unsaturated fatty acids inhibit colorectal cancer
(33). MUFAs also have anti-inﬂammatory properties. Yu et al.
(34) showed that nut consumption was inversely associated with
concentrations of C-reactive protein and IL-6 in the Nurses’
Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study.

A nonsigniﬁcant association was found between peanut butter
consumption and an increased risk of esophageal adenocarci-
noma. This association could be due to residual confounding by
BMI; peanut butter consumers had a slightly higher BMI than

non-consumers. However, although nuts contain large amounts of
calories, nut consumption was not related to obesity in our study
or those of other groups (6).

This study has several strengths, including its prospective
design, the very large sample size, extensive information on
dietary and lifestyle factors, and information on tumor location
and histology, which allowed us to thoroughly assess the effect
modiﬁcation and variation in risk by cancer subtype. This study
also has several limitations. We collected nut and peanut butter
consumption data from only one FFQ; thus the study is sus-
ceptible to measurement error as a result of the exposure col-
lection methods and possible changes in diet during the long
follow-up period. Our population was also more educated and
more likely to be non-Hispanic white than the total US pop-
ulation, which may limit the generalizability of the results. The
consumption of nuts was asked about in just one question, and we
therefore could not investigate the effects of different types of
nuts, such as peanuts and walnuts, which contain different nu-
trients. Also, we did not collect any information on whether
participants consumed salted or unsalted nuts, which could be an
effect modiﬁer. We also do not have any data on Helicobacter
pylori infection status, which is a known risk factor for gastric
cancer. Reverse casualty is possible because subjects with early
undiagnosed cancer may have restricted nut and peanut butter
consumption. However, after we excluded the ﬁrst 2 y of follow-
up, the results remained unchanged.

In conclusion, in this large cohort study of older American
adults, we found inverse associations between both nut and peanut
butter consumption and the risk of gastric noncardia cancer. These
prospective inverse associations are novel ﬁndings, and because
both nuts and peanut butter are widely consumed, more research

into their health effects, including their associations with cancer, is
warranted. If their associations with cancer were conﬁrmed in
other prospective studies,
investigation of possible mediating
mechanisms in future studies would be valuable.
