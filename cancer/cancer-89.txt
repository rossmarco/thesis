Abstract
There are geographic and ethnic differences in the incidence 
of gastric cancer around the world as well as with its trends 
for  each  population  over  time.  The  incidence  patterns  ob-
served  among  immigrants  change  according  to  where  they 
live. All of these factors serve to indicate the close association 
of  gastric  cancer  with  modiﬁ able  factors  such  as  diet.  This 
review presents epidemiological evidence on the association 
between dietary factors and gastric cancer based on previous 
systematic  reviews  and  subsequent  updates.  Infection  with 
Helicobacter pylori is a strong and established risk factor of 
gastric cancer but is not a sufﬁ cient cause for its development. 
Substantial evidence from ecological, case-control, and cohort 
studies strongly suggests that the risk may be increased with 
a high intake of various traditional salt-preserved foods and 
salt per se and decreased with a high intake of fruit and vege-
tables,  particularly  fruit.  However,  it  remains  unclear  which 
constituents in fruit and vegetables play a signiﬁ cant role in 
gastric cancer prevention. Among them, vitamin C is a plau-
sible candidate supported by a relatively large body of epide-
miological  evidence.  Consumption  of  green  tea  is  possibly 
associated  with  a  decreased  risk  of  gastric  cancer,  although 
the protective effects have been, for the most part, identiﬁ ed 
in Japanese women, most of whom are nonsmokers. In con-
trast, processed meat and N-nitroso compounds may be posi-
tively associated with the risk of gastric cancer. In conclusion, 
dietary modiﬁ cation by reducing salt and salted food intake, 
as well as by increasing intake of fruit and vitamin C, repre-
sents a practical strategy to prevent gastric cancer.

Introduction

In  2000,  gastric  cancer  was  the  second  most  frequent 
cause  of  cancer  death  worldwide  and  the  fourth  most 
common cancer, with an estimated 650 000 deaths and 
880 000 new cases per year. Almost two-thirds of these 
new cases occurred in developing countries [1]. In Ja-
pan, gastric cancer accounted for 51 000 deaths in 2004, 
or 16% of all cancer deaths (Vital Statistics: Ministry of 
Health,  Labor  and  Welfare,  Japan);  a  total  of  103 000 
new cases were detected in 2000, or 19% of all incident 
cancers [2]. The prevention of gastric cancer therefore 
represents  one  of  the  most  important  aspects  of  any 
cancer control strategy in Japan and around the world.
There are geographic and ethnic differences in gastric 
cancer incidence in the world and in its trends for each 
population with time. The incidence patterns observed 
among immigrants change according to where they live. 
These  factors  indicate  the  close  association  of  gastric 
cancer with modiﬁ able factors such as diet. Substantial 
evidence from ecological, case-control, and cohort stud-
ies strongly suggest that the risk of cancer increases with 
a high intake of various traditional salt-preserved foods 
as  well  as  salt  per  se  and  that  this  risk  could  be  de-
creased with a high intake of fruit and vegetables [3,4]. 
A recent report of a joint World Health Organization 
(WHO)/Food  and  Agriculture  Organization  (FAO) 
Expert Consultation concluded that salt-preserved food 
and salt “probably” increase the risk of gastric cancer, 
whereas  fruit  and  vegetables  “probably”  decrease  the 
risk  [5].  Other  established  nondietary  factors  include 
cigarette smoking [6] and infection with the bacterium 
Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) [7]. In addition, there is 
some evidence that the intake of green tea and vitamin 
C is associated with the risk of gastric cancer.

In this review, we present epidemiological evidence 
for the association between dietary factors and gastric 
cancer, with particular reference to our recent work as 
well as related articles.

S. Tsugane and S. Sasazuki: Diet and the risk of gastric cancer

Salt-preserved food and salt

In experimental studies in rats, ingestion of salt is known 
to cause gastritis and, on co-administration, to enhance 
the  carcinogenic  effects  of  known  gastric  carcinogens 
such as N-methyl-N-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) 
[8,9]. A high salt concentration in the stomach destroys 
the mucosal barrier and leads to inﬂ ammation and dam-
age such as diffuse erosion and degeneration. Further-
more,  the  induced  proliferative  change  may  act  to 
promote  the  effect  of  food-derived  carcinogens.  It  is 
therefore biologically plausible that high salt intake in-
creases the risk of gastric cancer in humans.

Evidence from ecological studies

There are substantial geographic differences in the in-
cidence of and mortality associated with gastric cancer 
worldwide, as well as nationwide in Japan. Using data 
from  the  INTERSALT  study,  in  which  randomly 
selected 24-h urine samples from 39 populations were 
sampled  from  24  countries  (n  =  5756),  Joossens  and 
colleagues  analyzed  median  sodium  levels  in  samples 
from  subjects  aged  20–49  years  in  relation  to  the 
national gastric cancer mortality rates [10]. For the 24 
countries, the Pearson correlation of gastric cancer mor-
tality with sodium was 0.70 in men and 0.74 in women 
(both  P  <  0.001).  In  an  ecological  study  of  65  rural 
counties  in  China,  the  consumption  of  salt-preserved 
vegetables was correlated with gastric cancer mortality 
(r = 0.26 in men, 0.36 in women) [11].

Approximately 

threefold  differences 

in  age-
standardized  mortality  rates  have  been  identiﬁ ed  in 
Japan, with higher rates in Akita and Yamagata prefec-
tures, lower rates in Kyushu district prefectures such as 
Kagoshima and Miyazaki, and an especially low rate in 
Okinawa  (Vital  Statistics:  Ministry  of  Health,  Labor 
and  Welfare,  Japan).  Our  ecological  study  of  ﬁ ve  se-
lected areas in Japan showed an almost linear correla-
tion  between  the  cumulative  mortality  rate  for  gastric 
cancer in subjects up to 75 years of age and the urinary 
salt excretion level in 24-h urine samples [12,13].

Both  age-adjusted  mortality  and  incidence  rates 
have  been  decreasing  for  several  decades  in  Japan. 
In the United States [14] and Europe [15], gastric can-
cer used to be one of the most common cancers; how-
ever, mortality rates have fallen dramatically over the 
last 50 years in all Western countries without any spe-
ciﬁ c intervention taken, and gastric cancer is now rare. 
This  worldwide  decline  in  incidence  is  likely  attribut-
able  to  the  spread  of  refrigeration,  the  use  of  which 
would  inversely  correlate  with  salting  and  other  salt-
based  methods  of  preservation  such  as  curing  and 
smoking, and with the overall volume of salt in the diet 
[3].

Studies in migrants offer clues about the relative im-
portance  of  genetic  and  environmental  factors  in  the 
etiology of cancer and are particularly useful when large 
differences  exist  between  the  original  and  host  coun-
tries  in  incidence  and  lifestyle.  Age-adjusted  (world 
population)  incidence  rates  of  gastric  cancer  among 
Japanese residents in Hawaii (USA) were signiﬁ cantly 
lower  than  in  Japan  among  both  men  and  women, 
whereas  rates  in  São  Paulo,  Brazil,  were  relatively 
similar to those in Japan [16]. These differences in inci-
dence  among  three  Japanese  populations  suggest  that 
lifestyle  changes,  mainly  dietary,  are  associated  with 
a  decreased  risk  of  gastric  cancer  depending  on  the 
degree  of  westernization  and  the  individual  incidence 
rate  in  the  respective  host  country  (United  States  or 
Brazil).

According  to  cross-sectional  studies  of  randomly 
selected  Japanese  Brazilians  in  the  city  of  São  Paulo 
(1989)  and  Japanese  living  in  ﬁ ve  prefectures  across 
Japan (1989–1991), the dietary habits of Japanese Bra-
zilians have shifted toward the pattern seen in Western 
countries  [17].  However,  Japanese  Brazilians  still 
consumed  traditional  and  salted  Japanese  foods:  15% 
of Japanese Brazilian men aged 40–49 years consumed 
miso soup almost daily, and 4% consumed pickled veg-
etables [18]. The degree of westernization was not strik-
ing  when  compared  with  that  of  Japanese  Americans. 
For example, only 2% of Japanese American men aged 
45–69 years in Hawaii consumed miso soup almost daily 
during the 1960s [19]. Furthermore, salt excretion levels 
in 24-h urine samples among Japan-born male residents 
aged  40–59  years  in  São  Paulo  were  14.0 g/day  for  21 
volunteers originally from Iwate, Akita, and Nagasaki 
prefectures  and  8.7 g/day  for  12  volunteers  from 
Okinawa  Prefecture  (unpublished  data).  These  levels 
were closely comparable with those seen in each prefec-
ture in Japan.

The  substantial  decrease  in  the  incidence  of  gastric 
cancer among Japanese immigrants in the United States 
and the minimal decrease among Japanese immigrants 
in Brazil can be explained on the basis of the manner 
in  which  they  continue  to  maintain  Japanese  dietary 
habits, which are typically high in salt.

Evidence from case-control studies

Many but not all case-control studies have found a posi-
tive association between gastric cancer and the intake 
of  highly  salted  foods  such  as  salted  ﬁ sh,  cured  meat, 
and salted vegetables or the use of table salt [4]. Several 
studies  have  quantitatively  estimated  total  salt  intake 
and found a strong positive association with the risk of 
gastric cancer, and several others evaluated its associa-
tion  with  the  intake  of  salted  food  such  as  salted  ﬁ sh 
and  vegetables.  In  an  evaluation  performed  by  the

77

World Cancer Research Fund (WCRF) and the Ameri-
can Institute for Cancer Research (AICR) in 1997 [3], 
16 case-control studies reported an association between 
salt or salted food and the risk of gastric cancer. Eight 
of these estimated overall dietary salt or sodium intake; 
four showed strong statistically signiﬁ cant increases in 
risk  [odds  ratio  (OR)  =  2.1–5.0  for  the  highest  intake 
level], whereas the remaining four showed no substan-
tial association. Six of sixteen studies speciﬁ cally exam-
ined the use of table salt, with three reporting statistically 
signiﬁ cant  increased  risks  (OR  =  1.6–6.2  for  highest 
intakes)  and  two  nonsigniﬁ cant  ORs.  Several  recent 
case-control  studies  have  also  revealed  an  association 
between  salted  food  and  the  risk  of  gastric  cancer 
[20–23].

Evidence from cohort studies

Prospective data are scarce, and only two studies were 
evaluated in the 1997 report by the WCRF and AICR 
[3]. One reported no association with the intake of table 
salt or soy sauce, although the second found an associa-
tion between salted ﬁ sh intake and an increased risk of 
gastric cancer in white American men, largely of Scan-
dinavian and German descent [relative risk (RR) = 1.9 
for the highest intake level].

Four  more  recent  studies  have  also  reported  this 
association.  Ngoan  and  colleagues  examined  13 000 
Japanese  men  and  women  and  identiﬁ ed  116  gastric 
cancer deaths during a 10-year follow-up. Higher con-
sumption  of  pickled  foods  and  traditional  soups  were 
associated with increased risk, although without statisti-
cal signiﬁ cance [24].

The  Netherlands  Cohort  Study  examined  120 852 
men and women and identiﬁ ed 282 gastric cancer cases 
at a 6.3-year follow-up [25]. Salt intake was measured 
by  calculating  the  mean  daily  sodium  intake  (dietary 
salt) from 150 food items and by speciﬁ c questions re-
lated to the consumption of salt. The intake of dietary 
salt  and  several  types  of  cured  meat  showed  a  weak 
positive association with the risk of gastric cancer.

The Hisayama study examined 2476 men and women 
and identiﬁ ed 93 gastric cancer cases during a 14-year 
follow-up [26]. Dietary salt intake from a 70-item food 
frequency  questionnaire  was  signiﬁ cantly  associated 
with the risk of gastric cancer after considering H. pylori 
infection.

Our population-based prospective study examined a 
total of 18 684 men and 20 381 women aged 40–59 years 
and  documented  358  men  and  128  women  with  histo-
logically conﬁ rmed gastric cancer during the 12 years of 
follow-up [27]. After adjustment for potential confound-
ing factors, the category salt intake by quintile was dose-
dependently associated with the risk of gastric cancer in 
men (for trend, P < 0.001), whereas no clear trend was 

seen  in  women  (P  =  0.48).  The  weak  association  be-
tween salt intake and gastric cancer in women may have 
been due to the relatively low validity of the estimated 
salt intake: the Spearman rank correlation with a 2-day 
urinary excretion level was only 0.12 for women but 0.38 
for  men.  Although  the  association  was  less  clear  for 
miso  soup,  pickled  vegetables,  and  dried  ﬁ sh,  the  fre-
quency categories of highly salted food (e.g., salted ﬁ sh 
roe and salted ﬁ sh preserves) were strongly associated 
with gastric cancer risk in both sexes.

These ﬁ ndings imply that either the intake of highly 
salted food increases the risk of gastric cancer or that it 
is merely a good marker of a preference for salted food 
or salt intake in general. An alternative explanation for 
the  strong  association  between  highly  salted  food  and 
gastric  cancer  might  involve  the  presence  of  chemical 
carcinogens  such  as  N-nitroso  compounds,  which  are 
formed by the reacting nitrate or nitrite during the pro-
cess of preservation and during digestion in the stom-
ach.  A  recent  meta-analysis  based  on  six  prospective 
and nine case-control studies showed that the consump-
tion of processed meat was associated with an increased 
risk of gastric cancer [28]. Of note, processed meat often 
contains  chemical  carcinogens  such  as  the  N-nitroso 
compounds as well as high amounts of salt.

Salt, salted food intake, and Helicobacter pylori 
infection

Infection with H. pylori is an established risk factor of, 
but not a sufﬁ cient cause for, the development of gastric 
cancer  [7,29].  It  is  important  to  elucidate  the  role  salt 
and salted food play in the causal link between H. pylori 
infection and gastric cancer.

We  previously  tested  the  association  between  life-
style factors and H. pylori infection in a cross-sectional 
study of 634 men aged 40–49 years selected randomly 
from ﬁ ve areas in Japan. A total of 474 of the 628 men 
evaluated  were  positive  for  immunoglobulin  G  anti-
body against the bacterium [30]. Intake of pickled veg-
etables  was  positively  associated  with  the  prevalence 
of  H.  pylori  (ORs  against  men  who  consume  <1  day/
week = 1.19 for 1–2 days/week, 1.92 for 3–4 days/week, 
and 1.90 for 5–7 days/week; for trend, P = 0.02), as was 
the daily consumption of miso soup [OR against non-
daily consumers = 1.60, 95% conﬁ dence interval (CI) = 
1.03–2.49]. In contrast, occupation, number of siblings, 
education,  smoking,  alcohol  consumption,  and  other 
dietary habits were not signiﬁ cantly associated with the 
prevalence  of  infection  in  this  population.  Although 
there  are  limitations  to  cross-sectional  studies  such  as 
this one, the consumption of salted food appears to in-
crease the risk of H. pylori infection.

Mucosal damage induced by salt and salted food may 
increase  the  possibility  of  persistent  infection  with 

78 

S. Tsugane and S. Sasazuki: Diet and the risk of gastric cancer

H. pylori [31]. Although salted food intake may increase 
the risk of H. pylori infection, salt per se was shown to 
act synergistically and dose-dependently to promote the 
development  of  gastric  adenocarcinoma  in  Mongolian 
gerbils  treated  with  N-methyl-N-nitrosourea  (MNU) 
[32,33].  A  synergistic  exacerbatory  effect  of  H.  pylori 
infection and salted food intake has also been reported 
in case-control studies in Japan [34] and Korea [23].

Infection with H. pylori, however, is by itself unlikely 
to increase the intake of salted food, and H. pylori infec-
tion therefore cannot act as a confounder in the causal 
link  between  salt  and  salted  food  intake  and  gastric 
cancer.  Restricting  salt  and  salted  food  intake  can,  at 
the least, reduce the risk of gastric cancer.

In summary, a large body of evidence from descrip-
tive and analytical epidemiological studies on the asso-
ciation between salt and salted food intake and the risk 
of gastric cancer indicates that dietary modiﬁ cation to 
reduce salt and salted food intake is probably protective 
against gastric cancer even after considering H. pylori 
infection.

Fruit and vegetables

Fruit  and  vegetables  are  rich  sources  of  carotenoids, 
vitamin C, folate, and phytochemicals, which may have 
a  protective  role  in  the  carcinogenesis  process.  It  is 
likely  that  modulation  of  xenobiotic-metabolizing 
enzymes, in particular phase II enzymes, contributes to 
this putative preventive mechanism. The mechanisms of 
antioxidant activity may be also possible.

In 1997, an expert panel assembled by the WCRF and 
AICR concluded that diets high in fruit and vegetables 
“convincingly”  protect  against  gastric  cancer  [3].  This 
evaluation was based mainly on reports of case-control 
studies.  Since  then,  however,  several  cohort  studies 
have reported conﬂ icting results. The joint WHO/FAO 
Expert  Consultation  in  2003  concluded  that  fruit  and 
vegetables “probably,” but not “convincingly,” decrease 
the risk of gastric cancer [5].

A subsequent report by the International Agency for 
Research  on  Cancer  (IARC)  determined  that  higher 
intake of fruit “probably” and higher intake of vegeta-
bles “possibly” reduce the risk of gastric cancer [35]. For 
fruit,  the  association  has  been  evaluated  in  10  cohort 
studies, most of which reported an inverse association 
with a summary value of 0.85 (95% CI = 0.77–0.95). In-
verse  associations  were  more  striking  in  the  28  evalu-
able  case-control  studies,  with  summary  ORs  of  0.63 
(95%  CI  =  0.58–0.69).  For  vegetables,  the  association 
has been evaluated in ﬁ ve cohort studies, most of which 
reported  RRs  below  1.0.  However,  none  of  these  RR 
values  were  statistically  signiﬁ cant,  and  the  summary 
value was 0.94 (95% CI = 0.84–1.06). In contrast, most 

of the 20 evaluable case-control studies provided statis-
tically signiﬁ cant ORs below 1.0 and a summary value 
of 0.66 (95% CI = 0.61–0.71). The reason case-control 
studies were more likely to show an inverse association 
is not clear, although one explanation might be the re-
call bias inherent to case-control studies. Furthermore, 
people  with  preclinical  symptoms  of  gastric  cancer  or 
stomach  disorders  may  change  their  dietary  habits 
months or years before diagnosis.

A  meta-analysis  of  cohort  studies  published  up  to 
2004  reported  nonsigniﬁ cant  summary  estimates  (RR 
for the highest versus the lowest consumption category) 
of 0.89 (95% CI = 0.78–1.02) for fruit (13 studies) and 
0.98  (95%  CI  =  0.86–1.13)  for  vegetables  (8  studies) 
[36]. However, the inverse associations became clearer 
when the studies were limited to those with incidence 
data  (seven  studies  for  fruit:  RR  =  0.82,  95% 
CI =  0.73–0.93;  ﬁ ve  studies  for  vegetables:  RR =  0.88, 
95% CI = 0.69–1.13) and with follow-up periods of 10 
years or longer (three studies for fruit: RR = 0.66, 95% 
CI = 0.52–0.83; two studies for vegetables: RR = 0.71, 
95% CI = 0.53–0.94).

Subsequent to the evaluation by the IARC [35] and 
the  meta-analysis  of  Lunet  et  al.  [36],  several  cohort 
studies have reported the association with fruit and veg-
etables. In a study in Sweden (139 gastric cancer cases 
among 70 000 men and women) [37], subjects who con-
sumed 2.5 servings of vegetables or more per day had a 
hazard  ratio  of  0.56  (95%  CI  =  0.34–0.93)  compared 
with those who consumed less than 1.0 serving per day. 
The respective hazard ratio for fruit consumption was 
0.86 (95% CI = 0.52–1.43). In the European Prospective 
Investigation  into  Cancer  and  Nutrition  (330  gastric 
cancer  cases  among  520 000  men  and  women)  [38],  a 
protective  role  for  vegetable  intake  was  observed  for 
the  intestinal  type  of  gastric  cancer.  Citrus  fruit  con-
sumption may play a role in protection against gastric 
cardia cancer.

In  our  cohort  study  with  400  gastric  cancer  cases 
among  40 000  men  and  women,  the  RR  associated 
 with intake 1 day or more per week compared with less 
than 1 day per week was 0.64 (95% CI = 0.45–0.92) for 
yellow vegetables, 0.48 (95% CI = 0.25–0.89) for white 
vegetables, and 0.70 (95% CI = 0.49–1.00) for fruit. RRs 
associated with the quintile of total vegetable consump-
tion were 1.00, 0.86, 0.75, 0.90, and 0.75 (for trend, P = 
0.17). This association became clearer for the differenti-
ated type of gastric cancer, at 1.00, 0.96, 0.78, 0.88, and 
0.53  (for  trend,  P  =  0.03).  These  ﬁ ndings  suggest  that 
vegetable  and  fruit  intake,  even  in  relatively  low 
amounts,  is  associated  with  a  lower  risk  of  gastric 
cancer.

In  summary,  consumption  of  fruit  and  vegetables, 
particularly fruit, is probably protective against gastric 
cancer.  Nevertheless,  it  remains  unknown  which  con-

79

stituents in fruit and vegetables play a signiﬁ cant role in 
gastric cancer prevention.

Vitamin C (ascorbic acid)

Fruit  and  vegetables  are  rich  sources  of  vitamin  C. 
Vitamin C acts as an antioxidant and can quench reac-
tive oxygen species produced in the gastric environment 
[39]; it is also known to inhibit production of carcino-
genic N-nitroso compound in the stomach [40]. A pos-
sible relation between H. pylori infection and ascorbic 
acid is under investigation, as some research has indi-
cated that high-dose vitamin C is effective in inhibiting 
H. pylori infection [41,42].

The  WCRF/AICR  report  [3]  concluded  that  high 
dietary vitamin C intake probably decreases the risk of 
gastric cancer. This conclusion is based on 1 of 2 cohort 
studies  and  12  of  13  case-control  studies  showing 
inverse  associations  between  dietary  vitamin  C  intake 
and the risk of gastric cancer. In addition, one prospec-
tive study showed that baseline plasma vitamin C levels 
among subjects who died from gastric cancer (n = 20) 
was  20%  lower  than  those  who  remained  cancer-free 
(n  =  2421)  during  more  than  12  years  of  follow-up 
[43].

Since  then  a  limited  number  of  prospective  studies 
have directly tested the association between dietary in-
take or blood level of vitamin C and the risk of gastric 
cancer.  Dietary  intake  from  comprehensive  food  fre-
quency questionnaires was inversely associated with the 
risk of noncardia gastric cancer (n = 179) during a me-
dian follow-up of 12 years in Finnish male smokers [44] 
and  with  the  risk  of  gastric  cancer  (n  =  282)  over  6.3 
years in a Dutch cohort [45], with an inverse association, 
albeit  diminished,  in  the  latter  study  after  excluding 
cases diagnosed within 2 years of baseline.

A  nested  case-control  study  in  the  European  Pro-
spective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) 
compared the levels of dietary and prediagnostic plasma 
vitamin  C  between  215  gastric  cancer  cases  and  416 
matched controls [46]. No association with gastric can-
cer risk was observed for dietary vitamin C, whereas an 
inverse association was seen in the highest versus lowest 
quartile  of  plasma  vitamin  C  (OR  =  0.55,  95%  CI  = 
0.31–0.97; for trend, P = 0.04). This inverse association 
was more pronounced in subjects consuming high levels 
of red and processed meat, a factor that may increase 
endogenous N-nitroso compound production. In a nest-
ed case-control study in a cohort of 20 000 Chinese men 
(191 cases and 570 matched controls), increased serum 
levels of vitamin C were signiﬁ cantly associated with a 
reduced risk of gastric cancer among never-smoker and 
non-heavy-alcohol  drinking  men  (for  trend,  P  =  0.02) 
[47].

The use of vitamin C supplements was inversely and 
nonsigniﬁ cantly associated with the risk of gastric can-
cer mortality (n = 1725; RR = 0.83, 95% CI = 0.68–1.01) 
among a million U.S. adults followed for 16 years (Can-
cer Prevention Study II) [48]. However, the decrease in 
risk was observed among users of shorter duration only, 
not among those of longer duration.

A  nutritional  intervention  trial  in  Linxian,  China, 
showed that supplementation with β-carotene (15 mg), 
α-tocopherol (30 mg), and selenium (50 µg) reduced the 
risk of gastric cancer mortality by approximately 20% 
after  5.25  years  [49].  Other  micronutrients,  including 
vitamin C (120 mg), however, were associated with no 
reduction. In contrast, a chemoprevention trial of gas-
tric dysplasia in Colombia in which vitamin C supple-
mentation  at  2 g/day  for  6  years  was  tested  as  one  of 
three treatment regimens showed that vitamin C as well 
as 30 mg β-carotene and anti-H. pylori therapy increased 
the regression rate of gastric precancerous lesions [50].
In  our  population-based,  double-blind,  randomized 
controlled trial to examine the effect of 5 years of vita-
min C supplementation, a statistically signiﬁ cant differ-
ence was seen between the high-dose group (500 mg/day) 
and the low-dose group (50 mg/day) (P = 0.046) in the 
change in the pepsinogen I/pepsinogen II ratio, a mark-
er of mucosal atrophic change in the stomach. This ﬁ nd-
ing suggests that vitamin C supplementation may protect 
against  the  progression  of  gastric  mucosal  atrophy 
[51].

In summary, when the relatively consistent epidemio-
logical  evidence  and  biological  plausibility  are  consid-
ered, dietary or supplemental vitamin C intake probably 
decreases the risk of gastric cancer.

Green tea and other beverages

Green tea

Green tea contains polyphenols, more commonly known 
as  catechins.  Major  green  tea  catechins  include  (−)-
epigallocatechin-3-gallate  (EGCG),  (−)-epigallocate-
chin  (EGC),  (−)-epicatechin-3-gallate  (ECG),  and 
(−)-epicatechin  (EC).  Antioxidant  activities  and  the 
ability  to  inhibit  the  nitrosation  of  polyphenols  have 
been isolated from green tea in both in vitro and in vivo 
studies  [52–54].  In  addition,  recent  research  has  pro-
posed many other possible mechanisms for the cancer-
inhibitory effects of green tea, including modulation of 
signal transduction pathways, leading to the inhibition 
of  cell  proliferation  and  transformation,  induction  of 
apoptosis and cell cycle arrest, and inhibition of tumor 
invasion and angiogenesis [55–57].

The  WCRF/AICR  report  [3]  included  ﬁ ve  case-
control studies investigating the relation between green 

80

tea intake and gastric cancer risk. Among these studies, 
four suggested a protective effect. Although a Japanese 
study showed a signiﬁ cant decrease in risk only among 
those  consuming  10  cups  or  more  per  day,  a  Chinese 
study identiﬁ ed a clear dose relation. In contrast, a case-
control  study  in  Japan  observed  no  material  associa-
tions  for  green  tea.  Based  on  these  ﬁ ndings,  the 
WCRF/AICR report concluded that high consumption 
of  green  tea  “possibly”  decreases  the  risk  of  gastric 
cancer.  More  recent  case-control  studies  have  also 
shown  a  reduction  in  the  risk  with  green  tea  intake, 
most with statistical signiﬁ cance [58–61].

In  contrast  to  laboratory  studies  and  most  case-
control  studies,  however,  all  but  one  recent  cohort 
study have shown no protective effect of green tea for 
gastric cancer [62–65]. In a population-based prospec-
tive study conducted in Miyagi Prefecture in northern 
Japan,  the  RRs  associated  with  drinking  one  or  two, 
three  or  four,  and  ﬁ ve  or  more  cups  of  green  tea  per 
day, as compared with less than one cup per day, were 
1.3 (95% CI = 0.8–1.9), 1.2 (95% CI = 0.8–1.8), and 1.5 
(95% CI = 1.0–2.1), respectively, in men (for trend, P 
=  0.03),  and  0.8  (95%  CI  =  0.5–1.5),  0.7  (95%  CI  = 
0.4–1.3),  and  0.8  (95%  CI  =  0.5–1.3),  respectively,  in 
women (for trend, P = 0.46) [62]. In a nationwide mul-
ticenter  prospective  study,  no  inverse  association  was 
found between green tea consumption and gastric can-
cer death, with the risks associated with drinking 1 or 
2, 3 or 4, 5–9, and ≥ 10 cups of green tea per day, rela-
tive to those of drinking less than 1 cup per day, of 1.6 
(95%  CI =  0.9–2.9),  1.1  (95%  CI =  0.6–1.9),  1.0  (95% 
CI = 0.5–2.0), and 1.0 (95% CI = 0.5–2.0), respectively, 
in men (for trend, P = 0.669), and 1.1 (95% CI = 0.5–
2.5),  1.0  (95%  CI  =  0.5–2.5),  0.8  (95%  CI  =  0.4–1.6), 
and 0.8 (95% CI = 0.3–2.1), respectively, in women (for 
trend,  P  =  0.448)  [63].  Furthermore,  green  tea  con-
sumption  was  virtually  unrelated  to  the  incidence  of 
any  cancer,  including  gastric  cancer,  in  a  follow-up 
study  of  atomic  bomb  survivors  in  Hiroshima  and 
Nagasaki [64].

In our cohort study, among 73 000 subjects with 890 
gastric cancers, although no association between green 
tea consumption and gastric cancer was observed among 
men, decreased risk was suggested in women, with RRs 
and 95% CI for one or two, three or four, and ﬁ ve or 
more cups per day compared to less than one cup per 
day of 0.85 (95% CI = 0.53–1.38), 1.04 (95% CI = 0.68–
1.58), and 0.67 (95% CI = 0.43–1.04), respectively (for 
trend,  P  =  0.08)  [65].  This  association  was  further 
strengthened  when  cancer  was  restricted  to  the  distal 
portion,  with  a  RR  of  0.51  (95%  CI  =  0.30–0.86)  for 
consumption  of  ﬁ ve  or  more  cups  of  green  tea  (for 
trend, P = 0.01). These results are consistent with those 
of  previous  prospective  studies  in  that  decreased  risk 
was more apparent in women.

In summary, consumption of green tea is possibly as-
sociated with decreased risk of gastric cancer, especially 
in  Japanese  women,  most  of  whom  are  nonsmokers. 
Further  prospective  studies  with  detailed  information 
are  needed  to  clarify  the  role  of  green  tea  on  gastric 
carcinogenesis.

Black tea and coffee

Although  catechin  levels  in  black  tea  are  only  about 
30%  of  those  in  green  tea,  the  inhibitory  activity  of 
black tea against tumorigenesis has been shown to be 
comparable to that of green tea in several animal mod-
els [66]. Most of three prospective studies and 12 case-
control studies showed no association with the risk of 
gastric cancer. Thus, the WCRF/AICR found that high 
consumption of black tea “probably” has no association 
with the risk of gastric cancer [3]. Only one prospective 
study  in  Japan  has  been  conducted  since  then,  and  it 
showed  a  nonsigniﬁ cant  increase  in  the  risk  of  gastric 
cancer  among  women  who  drink  black  tea  more  than 
several times per week [67]. It is possible that lifestyle, 
which was not investigated in this study, was associated 
with the increased risk of gastric cancer. Thus, the evi-
dence is less clear for black tea than for green tea.

Caffeine,  kahweol,  and  cafestol  in  coffee  may  con-
tribute to a protective effect against cancer [68]. Based 
on  the  evaluation  of  two  prospective  and  eight  case-
control studies, which showed no statistically signiﬁ cant 
association  between  coffee  consumption  and  gastric 
cancer, the WCRF/AICR concluded that high consump-
tion of coffee “probably” has no relation with the risk 
of gastric cancer [3]. In a more recent systematic review 
and meta-analysis of 23 studies (7 cohort studies and 16 
case-control studies) [68], coffee intake showed no ef-
fect on gastric cancer when all studies were combined 
(OR = 0.97, 95% CI = 0.86–1.09), with a combined risk 
estimate of 1.02 (95% CI = 0.76–1.37) for cohort studies, 
0.90  (95%  CI  =  0.70–1.15)  for  population-based  case-
control studies, and 0.97 (95% CI = 0.83–1.13) for hos-
pital-based  case-control  studies.  Notwithstanding  that 
risk estimates differed signiﬁ cantly according to country 
of  origin,  with  North  American  studies  presenting  a 
signiﬁ cantly  higher  risk,  this  meta-analysis  showed  no 
overall  effect  of  coffee  consumption  on  gastric  cancer 
risk.

In summary, there is no apparent evidence that black 
tea or coffee consumption has any effect on the risk of 
gastric cancer.

Conclusions

Although the eradication of H. pylori may be a promis-
ing strategy for gastric cancer prevention, most middle-

aged and elderly Japanese are already infected with this 
pathogen  [30].  The  worldwide  decrease  in  the  age-
adjusted  incidence  of  gastric  cancer  over  the  last  50 
years occurred without any intentional H. pylori infec-
tion  eradication  program.  Rather,  and  perhaps  more 
importantly, it can be related to decreased intake of salt 
and salted food and increased intake of fresh fruit and 
vegetables,  which  arose  subsequent  to  the  mass  avail-
ability of refrigeration. Dietary modiﬁ cation to reduce 
salt  and  salted  food  intake  and  to  increase  intake  of 
fruit, particularly vitamin C — as well as quitting smok-
ing — represents an effective, practical, low-cost means 
of preventing gastric cancer.
