Abstract

Background: Flavonoids are bioactive polyphenolic compounds found in fruits, vegetables, and beverages of plant origin.

Previous studies have shown that ﬂavonoid intake reduces the risk of certain cancers; however, few studies to date have

examined associations of ﬂavonoids with upper gastrointestinal cancers or used prospective cohorts.

Objective: Our study examined the association between intake of ﬂavonoids (anthocyanidins, ﬂavan-3-ols, ﬂavanones,

ﬂavones, ﬂavonols, and isoﬂavones) and risk of head and neck, esophageal, and gastric cancers.

Methods: The NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study is a prospective cohort study that consists of 469,008 participants. Over a

mean 12-y follow-up, 2453 head and neck (including 1078 oral cavity, 424 pharyngeal, and 817 laryngeal), 1165 esophageal

(890 adenocarcinoma and 275 squamous cell carcinoma), and 1297 gastric (625 cardia and 672 noncardia) cancer cases

were identiﬁed. We used Cox proportional hazards regression models to estimate HRs and CIs for the associations
between ﬂavonoid intake assessed at study baseline and cancer outcomes. For 56 hypotheses examined, P-trend values

were adjusted using the Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) procedure for false discovery rate control.

Results: The highest quintile of total ﬂavonoid intake was associated with a 24% lower risk of head and neck cancer (HR:
0.76; 95% CI: 0.66, 0.86; BH-adjusted 95% CI: 0.63, 0.91; P-trend = 0.02) compared with the lowest quintile. Notably,

anthocyanidins were associated with a 28% lower risk of head and neck cancer (HR: 0.72; 95% CI: 0.62, 0.82; BH-adjusted
95% CI: 0.59, 0.87; P-trend = 0.0005), and ﬂavanones were associated with a 22% lower risk of head and neck cancer (HR:
0.78; 95% CI: 0.68, 0.89; BH-adjusted 95% CI: 0.64, 0.94; P-trend: 0.02). No associations between ﬂavonoid intake and

risk of esophageal or gastric cancers were found.

Conclusions: Our results indicate that ﬂavonoid intake is associated with lower head and neck cancer risk. These

associations suggest a protective effect of dietary ﬂavonoids on head and neck cancer risk, and thus potential as a risk
reduction strategy. J Nutr 2017;147:1729–38.

vegetables, and beverages of plant origin (1). Epidemiologic
studies have shown that diets high in fruits and vegetables are
associated with a decreased risk of upper gastrointestinal cancers,
including cancers of the head and neck (2), esophagus (3, 4), and
stomach (5). Flavonoids are hypothesized to account for a
portion of this risk reduction through chemopreventive mech-
anisms of cell cycle regulation, cellular proliferation, apopto-
sis, and modulation of carcinogen metabolism and inﬂammatory
pathways (6).

Upper gastrointestinal cancers represent an etiologically
diverse group of cancers and can be divided by histologic classi-
ﬁcations (i.e., squamous cell carcinoma or adenocarcinoma).

Head and neck cancers include squamous cell carcinomas
of the oral cavity, pharynx, and larynx. The primary risk
factors for head and neck cancer are tobacco use and alcohol
consumption (7–9). Esophageal cancer consists of squamous cell
carcinoma, which can occur throughout the esophagus, and
adenocarcinoma, which is typically located in the distal third
of the esophagus near the gastroesophageal junction (10).
The primary risk factors for esophageal squamous cell carci-
noma are squamous dysplasia (11) and tobacco use and alcohol
consumption (12), whereas esophageal adenocarcinoma risk
factors include gastroesophageal reﬂux disease (13), obesity
(14), and tobacco use (15). Gastric cancers include adenocarci-
nomas of the cardia (i.e., the proximal portion of the stomach
near the gastroesophageal junction) and noncardia (i.e., the
distal portion of the stomach) (16). The primary risk factors
for gastric cardia adenocarcinoma are similar to esophageal
adenocarcinoma (13–15), whereas risk factors for noncardia
gastric adenocarcinoma include Helicobacter pylori and gastric
ulcers (16) and tobacco use (12).

Epidemiologic studies have shown inverse associations be-
tween ﬂavonoids and cancers of the head and neck (17–19),
esophagus (20), and stomach (21–29). However, few studies to
date have examined associations using a prospective cohort, and
no prospective studies to date have examined head and neck
cancer. Clariﬁcation of these associations may help elucidate
the underlying etiology and provide empirical support for
utilizing ﬂavonoid compounds as potential cancer risk reduc-
tion strategies.

We used data from the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study to
investigate the relation between dietary intake of ﬂavonoids and
incidence of head and neck, esophageal, and gastric cancers.

Methods

Study population. The NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study is a
prospective cohort study consisting of AARP (formerly known as
the American Association of Retired Persons) members residing in 6
states (California, Florida, Louisiana, New Jersey, North Carolina, and
Pennsylvania) and 2 metropolitan areas (Atlanta, Georgia, and Detroit,
Michigan) (30). Between 1995 and 1996, baseline information including
dietary intake, demographic characteristics, and health behaviors was
collected from AARP members aged 50–71 y. This information was
collected by mailing questionnaires to 3.5 million members; 566,398
members completed the questionnaire and consented to participate in
the study. The National Cancer Institute Institutional Review Board
approved the NIH-AARP study protocol. We excluded subjects with
cancer at baseline (n = 52,708), death-only reports of cancer (n = 4421),
proxy reports (n = 14,245), and total energy intake outside the range of
500–3500 kcal/d for women and 800–4000 kcal/d for men (n = 26,016)
(31). Our analytic sample included 275,982 men and 193,026 women
(Supplemental Figure 1).

Cohort follow-up and case ascertainment. Study participants were
followed from the date baseline information was collected to the date of
the ﬁrst cancer diagnosis, the date of death, the date the individual
moved out of case ascertainment area, or the end of the study period (31
December 2011). Cancer cases were identiﬁed by probabilistic linkage
with 11 cancer registries (including states and areas of participant
recruitment and Arizona, Nevada, and Texas). This method of case ascer-
tainment was previously shown to detect ~90% of all incident cancer cases
in the NIH-AARP cohort (32).

The cases were classiﬁed using topography and morphology codes
from the third edition of the International Classiﬁcation of Disease for
Oncology (33). All cases of head and neck cancer with squamous cell
carcinoma histology (morphology codes 8010, 8020, 8021, 8032, 8045,
8050, 8051, 8052, 8070, 8071, 8072, 8073, 8074, 8075, 8076, and

8083) were included in this analysis (topography codes C00.0–C13.9,
C14.0, C14.2, C14.8, and C32.0–C32.9). The site of head and neck
cancer was classiﬁed as follows: oral cavity (C00.0–C06.9), oro- and
hypopharynx (C09.0–C09.9, C10.0–C10.9, C12.9, and C13.0–C13.9),
and larynx (C32.0–C32.9). Cancers were classiﬁed as esophageal with
topography codes of C15.0–C15.9. Esophageal cancers were further
classiﬁed by squamous cell carcinoma (morphology codes 8070, 8071,
8072, and 8074) and adenocarcinoma (8140, 8142, 8144, 8260, 8261,
8263, 8310, 8480, 8481, 8490, and 8570) histology. All cases of gastric
cancer with adenocarcinoma histology (morphology codes: 8010, 8012,
8021, 8140, 8142, 8143, 8144, 8145, 8210, 8211, 8255, 8260, 8261,
8263, 8310, 8480, 8481, 8490, 8510, and 8574) were included in this
analysis. Gastric adenocarcinomas were classiﬁed as cardia (C16.0) and
noncardia (C16.1–C16.9).

Dietary data. Dietary data for the previous 12 mo were collected
at baseline using an early version of the National Cancer Institute
Diet History Questionnaire (http://dietandhealth.cancer.gov/docs/
diet_questionnaire_baseline.pdf), which is a self-administered FFQ.
Study participants reported the frequency of consumption for 124
food items and corresponding portion sizes for 116 food items.

Flavonoid content for each food item was obtained using the 2015
USDA Expanded Flavonoid Database for the Assessment of Dietary
Intakes (34). The USDA Nutrient Data Laboratory constructed this
ﬂavonoid database based on the analytical values from the 2013 USDA
Database for the Flavonoid Content of Selected Foods for 506 foods (35)
and the 2008 USDA Database for the Isoﬂavone Content of Selected
Foods for 557 foods (36). To create the expanded ﬂavonoid database,
analytical ﬂavonoid values were ﬁrst assigned to foods with direct
matches from either of the above-mentioned 2008 or 2013 USDA
databases. Next, values were assigned to foods that lacked a direct match
using $1 of the following criteria: moisture adjustment, retention
factors, food yield factors, substitution with similar foods, market
share, generic proﬁles, and other sources [e.g., Phenol-Explorer, release
2.0 (37)] (34). Overall, the expanded ﬂavonoid database contains data
on 29 individual ﬂavonoids and 6 ﬂavonoid classes (anthocyanidins,
ﬂavan-3-ols, ﬂavanones, ﬂavones, ﬂavonols, and isoﬂavones) for 2926
foods found in the USDA National Nutrient Database for Standard
Reference (38).

The FFQ line-item weights were based on ‘‘usual’’ population
consumption, which was estimated using 24-h recall data from the
1994–1996 USDA Continuing Survey of Food Intakes by Individuals
(CSFII) (39). Generally, these weights are determined by some metric of
usual population consumption, but often these are based on a more
restrictive list. For example, an FFQ may typically deﬁne the weights of
the line item ‘‘Other fruit juice or fruit juice mixture (such as apple,
grape, pineapple, or others)’’ as 50% of consumption from apple juice,
40% from grape juice, and 10% from pineapple juice. However, in the
NIH-AARP study, any other reported type of fruit juice (e.g., guava juice
drink or grapefruit juice) would receive a portion of the line-item weight,
corresponding to the frequency of report on the 24-h recalls. Thus, foods
and beverages reported on CSFII 24-h recalls were placed into food
groups consistent with line items on the NIH-AARP study FFQ, and
nutrient estimates were calculated based on a weighted mean of foods
in each group. Because the CSFII nutrient database did not include
ﬂavonoid values, we added them to the original CSFII database to create
NIH-AARP study FFQ ﬂavonoid values using methodology consistent
with previous reports (40). For a few foods (e.g., poblano peppers),
ﬂavonoid values were not available in the database. We thus matched
these to a similar food (i.e., green hot chili peppers), which we thought
would have similar ﬂavonoid values. This database was then linked with
an individual participantÕs reported frequency of consumption and the
corresponding portion size for each line item. Dietary sources of
ﬂavonoid intake are presented in Supplemental Table 1.

We derived intakes of 6 ﬂavonoid classes: anthocyanidins (cyanidin,
delphinidin, malvidin, pelargonidin, peonidin, petunidin), ﬂavan-3-ols (cat-
echin, epicatechin, epicatechin 3-gallate, epigallocatechin, epigallocatechin
3-gallate, gallocatechin, theaﬂavin, theaﬂavin 3-gallate, theaﬂavin 3#-gallate,
theaﬂavin 3,3#-digallate, thearubigins), ﬂavanones (eriodictyol, hesperetin,
naringenin), ﬂavones (apigenin, luteolin), ﬂavonols (isorhamnetin, kaempferol,

myricetin, quercetin), and isoﬂavones (daidzein, genistein, glycitein). We
also derived intakes of total ﬂavonoids (summation of all classes).

Statistical analysis. Cox proportional hazards models were used to
calculate HRs and 95% CIs for the association between ﬂavonoid intake
and incidence of each tumor type as distinct outcomes, with years of
follow-up as the underlying time metric. Follow-up of the analytic cohort
occurred from the time at completion of baseline questionnaire until an
event (i.e., incident upper gastrointestinal cancer) or right-censoring
(i.e., other cancer diagnosis, death, loss to follow-up, or last date of
follow-up), whichever occurred ﬁrst. In models examining one upper
gastrointestinal cancer (e.g., head and neck cancer) as the primary
outcome, the other upper gastrointestinal cancers (i.e., esophageal and
gastric cancer) were censored events and vice versa. Subjects with
missing values were removed from the models. The proportional hazards

assumption was tested using an interaction term between total ﬂavo-
noids (deﬁned as continuous and categorical) and log(time) in models
that included confounders, and no interaction was observed (P $ 0.05).
For our primary analysis, absolute ﬂavonoid intakes were catego-
rized as quintiles, based on the distribution of intake among all study
participants (31). Tests of linear trend were performed based on the
quintile-speciﬁc medians of ﬂavonoid intake. Because continuous ﬂavo-
noid intake (expressed as mg/d) was right skewed, ﬂavonoid intakes
were also analyzed as log2-transformed continuous variables. The HR
in relation to a 1-unit change in log2-transformed ﬂavonoid intake
corresponds to a doubling of absolute ﬂavonoid intake (Supplemental
Table 2).

Effect modiﬁcation by age, sex, race, education, smoking status, BMI
(in kg/m2), energy intake, alcohol intake, self-rated health, and vigorous
physical activity was assessed using likelihood ratio tests comparing

1 Ranges for quintiles of total ﬂavonoid intake are given in parentheses. HRs are adjusted for age at baseline (,55, 55–59, 60–64, 65–69, or
$70 y), sex, race (non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, or other), education (less than high school, completed high school or post–high
school training other than college, some college or college graduate, or postgraduate), smoking status (never smoker, former smoker of
#20 or .20 cigarettes/d, or current smoker of #20 or .20 cigarettes/d), BMI (in kg/m2: ,25, 25 to ,30, or $30), alcohol intake (0–0.19,
0.20–1.83, 1.84–11.5, or 11.6–450.94 g/d), self-reported health (excellent, very good, good, fair, or poor), vigorous physical activity of
$20 min (never, rarely, 1–3 times/mo, or 1–2, 3–4, or $5 times/wk), and total energy intake (expressed as kcal/d). HRs compare the risk of
developing cancer for participants in each quintile of ﬂavonoid intake to participants in the lowest quintile of ﬂavonoid intake, holding all
other covariates constant. BH, Benjamini-Hochberg.
2 For all P-trend values, tests for linear trend were calculated by assigning the median of each quintile as scores.
3 For all BH-adjusted P-trend values, the linear trend tests were adjusted for multiple comparisons using the BH procedure for false
discovery rate control at the 0.05 level for 56 comparisons (44).

regression models with and without a multiplicative term (41). We found
no evidence of effect modiﬁcation (P $ 0.05).

We conducted a backward stepwise regression to evaluate potential
confounders. Variables remained in the adjusted model if they were
signiﬁcant (P < 0.10) in the backward stepwise selection (42). All
covariates met the inclusion criteria and were included in the ﬁnal
models as follows: age at baseline (<55, 55–59, 60–64, 65–69, or $70 y),
sex, race (non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, or other), education
(less than high school, completed high school or post–high school
training other than college, some college or college graduate, or post-
graduate), smoking status (never smoker, former smoker of #20 or >20
cigarettes/d, or current smoker of #20 or >20 cigarettes/d), BMI (<25,
25 to <30, or $30), alcohol intake (quartiles of intake: 0–0.19, 0.20–
1.83, 1.84–11.5, or 11.6–450.94 g/d), self-rated health (excellent, very
good, good, fair, or poor), and vigorous physical activity of $20 min
(never, rarely, 1–3 times/mo, or 1–2, 3–4, or $5 times/wk). Total energy
intake (expressed as kcal/d) was included for adjustment as an a priori
confounder (43).

The linear trend tests were adjusted for multiple comparisons using
the Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) procedure for false discovery rate
control at the 0.05 level for 56 comparisons (44). In addition, for the
6 associations discovered by the BH procedure, we calculated BH-adjusted
CIs (45) for a comparison of quintile 5 and quintile 1 [i.e., CI at level
1 – 0.05 3 (6/56)]. The BH-adjusted CIs controlled the false coverage
rate (45), which is the expected fraction of CIs not covering their true
parameters among the discovered associations, at the 0.05 level. All
P values were 2 sided. Statistical analyses were conducted using SAS
software (version 9.3; SAS Institute).

Sensitivity analysis. We conducted a sensitivity analysis comparing
the results from the standard multivariate model, the nutrient density
model (Supplemental Table 3), and the residual model (Supplemental
Table 4) (31). The estimated HRs were not substantially different;
therefore, we chose to present results adjusted utilizing the standard
multivariate approach for ease of interpretation. Finally, we conducted
a 5-y lag analysis, excluding cases that developed cancer within the
ﬁrst 5-y of follow-up by delaying the start of follow-up for all
participants (Supplemental Tables 5–7), as individuals with symptoms
attributed to cancer (e.g., dysphagia) may have altered their dietary
habits.

Results

1297 gastric (625 cardia and 672 noncardia) cancer cases were
identiﬁed. Demographic characteristics of our study cohort by
quintile of total ﬂavonoid intake are presented in Table 1.
Compared with the lowest quintile, participants in the highest
quintile of total ﬂavonoid intake were more likely to have a
postgraduate education and were less likely to be smokers.

The highest quintile of total ﬂavonoid intake was associated
with a 24% lower risk of head and neck cancer (HR: 0.76; 95% CI:
0.66, 0.86; BH-adjusted 95% CI: 0.63, 0.91; P-trend = 0.02)
compared with the lowest quintile (Table 2). Dietary intake
of anthocyanidins was associated with a 28% lower risk of
head and neck cancer (HR: 0.72; 95% CI: 0.62, 0.82;
BH-adjusted 95% CI: 0.59, 0.87; P-trend = 0.0005), which
was also seen by subsite of oral cavity (HR: 0.78; 95% CI: 0.63,
0.96; BH-adjusted 95% CI: 0.58, 1.05; P-trend = 0.04) and
laryngeal (HR: 0.62; 95% CI: 0.48, 0.80; BH-adjusted 95% CI:
0.44, 0.89; P-trend = 0.02). Flavanone intake was associated
with a 22% lower risk of head and neck cancer (HR: 0.78; 95% CI:
0.68, 0.89; BH-adjusted 95% CI: 0.64, 0.94; P-trend = 0.02),
which was also seen for subsite of pharyngeal (HR: 0.58; 95% CI:
0.41, 0.82; BH-adjusted 95% CI: 0.36, 0.95; P-trend = 0.03).

No association was observed between ﬂavonoid intake and
esophageal adenocarcinoma or esophageal squamous cell carci-
noma (total ﬂavonoids: BH-adjusted P-trend = 0.8 and 0.8,
respectively) (Table 3). Similar to esophageal cancer, no asso-
ciation was found between ﬂavonoid intake and gastric cardia
adenocarcinoma or noncardia gastric adenocarcinoma (total
ﬂavonoids: BH-adjusted P-trend = 0.8 and 0.5, respectively)
(Table 4).

Discussion

In this large prospective study, we observed that total dietary
ﬂavonoid intake was associated with a 24% lower risk of head
and neck but not esophageal or gastric cancer. Anthocyanidins
and ﬂavanones were also associated with a lower risk of head and
neck cancer, but these inverse associations varied by tumor
subsite. No association was observed between any ﬂavonoid
class and esophageal or gastric cancer.

Over a mean follow-up of 12 y, 2453 head and neck (including 1078
oral cavity, 424 pharyngeal, and 817 laryngeal), 1165 esophageal
(890 adenocarcinoma, and 275 squamous cell carcinoma), and

Our ﬁndings for head and neck cancer are consistent with 2
previous case-control studies from Italy, which reported that
intake of total ﬂavonoids, ﬂavanones, and ﬂavonols was inversely

associated with all head and neck cancers (17, 46). Two previous
epidemiologic studies showed an inverse association between
intake of anthocyanidins and risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma
and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (21, 47). However, in
our study, we found no association between ﬂavonoid intake and
risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma or esophageal squamous
cell carcinoma. In addition, we report no association between
ﬂavonoid intake and gastric cancers, contrary to previous studies
that showed inverse associations between gastric cancer and
intake of total ﬂavonoids (23), anthocyanidins (23), ﬂavan-3-ols
(23), ﬂavanones (22), ﬂavones (22, 23), and ﬂavonols (22, 23, 25,
26). Possible reasons for the discrepancies between our study and
previous studies could be differences in the underlying population
and in adjustment factors. To date, the NIH-AARP study does not
have information on H. pylori infection or gastroesophageal
reﬂux disease, both of which could be potential confounders for
some subsites.

An inverse association between ﬂavonoid intake and cancer risk
is biologically plausible. In vitro studies showed that ﬂavonoids
have a number of chemopreventive mechanisms, including cell
cycle regulation, cellular proliferation, apoptosis, and modula-
tion of carcinogen metabolism and inﬂammatory pathways (6).
In vivo clinical and animal studies provide support for the
potential chemopreventive effects of ﬂavonoids. Similar to our
reported ﬁndings, ﬂavonoids were shown to reduce the incidence
of oral cancers in rodent models. Flavan-3-ols (i.e., catechin and
epicatechin 3-gallate), ﬂavanones (i.e., naringenin), ﬂavones (i.e.,
apigenin), and ﬂavonols (i.e., quercetin) all reduced the incidence
of oral tumors in hamster models (e.g., 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]
anthracene–induced carcinogenesis) (48).

To address the issue of multiple comparisons, we calculated
BH-adjusted P values. At a threshold of BH-adjusted P-trend
values # 0.05, total ﬂavonoids, anthocyanidins, and ﬂavanones
were the only ﬂavonoids considered to be statistically signiﬁ-
cantly associated with head and neck cancer. Adjusting for
multiple comparisons in this way protects against making >5%
false-positive associations across the 56 tests of trend. Thus, we
drew our main conclusions from these BH-adjusted P values, but

we also present unadjusted P values and 95% CIs in Tables 2–4
for the readerÕs convenience (31, 49).

Our study has several limitations. The ﬁrst potential source of
error is in estimating individual ﬂavonoid intakes based on
linking foods reported in the FFQ to the USDA ﬂavonoid
database. Flavonoid content of individual food items, particu-
larly fruits and vegetables, varies by plant varieties, degree of
ripeness, storage conditions, distance transported to market,
environmental factors affecting plant growth, horticultural
practices, industrial processing, and cooking methods (50).
Therefore, the study population may consume foods that differ
from the foods utilized to create estimates of ﬂavonoid content
in the nutrient database (34). In addition, the NIH-AARP study
population is from 8 different states. Thus, there may be
differences in the amount of ﬂavonoids consumed by study
participants as a result of regional differences. We examined the
association between total ﬂavonoids and head and neck cancer
and did not ﬁnd substantial differences by state (data not
shown). To determine the extent of ﬂavonoid variability, the
USDA Food Composition and Nutrient Data Laboratories also
sampled >60 fruits, vegetables, and nuts from 4 US regions at
2 times of the year. Although ﬂavonoid content was variable
within and between foods, ﬂavonoid values reported in the
USDA databases were similar to the mean ﬂavonoid content
determined by the USDA Food Composition and Nutrient Data
Laboratories (51). This issue of ﬂavonoid content estimation
applies to all studies utilizing nutritional databases to estimate
values for dietary intake (31).

The difference we observed in the median intake of total
ﬂavonoids between participants in the ﬁfth compared with the
ﬁrst quintiles was roughly equivalent to 2 cups tea/d (;473 mL).
However, the FFQ used for the NIH-AARP cohort did not
include line items on certain ﬂavonoid-rich foods like berries
(other than strawberries) and tofu. Although the FFQ did ask
about tea consumption, it did not capture the types of tea
(e.g., black versus green), which differ in ﬂavonoid concentration.
Thus, individual estimates of ﬂavonoid intake may be misclassiﬁed.
However, consumption of these ﬂavonoid-rich foods in the US
population is low (52) and is therefore unlikely to considerably
change the mean measured ﬂavonoid intake. FFQs also cannot

Flavonoids and upper gastrointestinal cancer

include every possible food item and therefore must be selective
in which foods are included. The FFQ utilized in our study was
designed to reﬂect the ‘‘typical’’ American diet; thus, there is
potential misclassiﬁcation of ﬂavonoid intake for subjects with
ethnic or specialty diets. For example, vegetarians are more likely
to consume tofu or tofu-based products, which are not assessed on
this FFQ and thus lead to misclassiﬁcation. In addition, FFQs are
known to suffer from measurement error. We attempted to mini-
mize measurement error, which commonly results in attenuated
risk estimates (53), by adjusting the models for energy intake (54).
However, we cannot exclude the possibility that some error
remains.

Bioavailability is also another source of measurement misclas-
siﬁcation. Measured dietary intake of ﬂavonoids may differ from
the internal dose. Little is known about the bioavailability of
ﬂavonoids, how metabolism of ﬂavonoids varies by individuals,
and the directed effect of ﬂavonoids on epithelial surfaces as
ﬂavonoids traverse the upper gastrointestinal tract (55). In
addition, ﬂavonoid absorption proﬁles are variable, with maxi-
mum circulating concentrations reached between 0.5 and 9 h
after dietary intake (56). Thus, biomarkers of ﬂavonoid intake
may not be highly correlated with usual adult dietary intake.
However, ﬂavonoid biomarkers in 24-h urine samples have
shown good correlation with fruit and vegetable intake calculated
from a prior-month FFQ (validity coefﬁcients = 0.43–0.66) (57).
Dysphagia (or difﬁculty swallowing) is a common symptom
of upper gastrointestinal cancers, which can lead individuals to
alter dietary habits. However, we observed similar results when
we conducted a 5-y lag analysis, excluding cases that developed
cancer within the ﬁrst 5-y of follow-up by delaying the start of
follow-up for all participants. Thus, an altered dietary state
owing to underlying disease is unlikely to account for the
associations, or lack thereof, that we observed.

Previous studies using the NIH-AARP data have reported on
the association between fruit and vegetable intake and upper
gastrointestinal cancers (58–60). An inverse association be-
tween fruit and vegetable intake and head and neck cancer was
reported (58), but the associations with esophageal (59) and
gastric (60) cancer were limited. Because ﬂavonoids are concen-
trated in fruits and vegetables (50), the association between
ﬂavonoids and head and neck cancer incidence may reﬂect diets
with greater consumption of such foods or a healthy lifestyle in
general. Because of issues of collinearity between fruit and
vegetable intake and ﬂavonoids (61), we were unable to assess
the effects of ﬂavonoids independent of fruit and vegetable
intake. In addition, ingestion of fatty foods can result in a
proinﬂammatory response (62). Some foods that contribute to
dietary ﬂavonoid intake, such as donuts and hotdogs, also have
high fat content. However, these foods contribute little to total
ﬂavonoid consumption. For instance, a medium plain cake-type
donut contains ~2.9 mg of ﬂavonoids, whereas a beef hotdog
contains ~0.9 mg (34).

Finally,

internal and external validity of the NIH-AARP
cohort may be lacking because of the low response rate (17.6%).
Responders to the baseline questionnaire were predominately
white, predominately noncurrent smokers, and more educated,
and they consumed less red meat and fat and more fruits and
vegetables compared with the general US population (30). In
addition, the dietary intake distributions were wider than what
has been reported in the general US population. This combina-
tion of altered and widened dietary intake distributions may
have compensated for the low response rate by allowing for
adequate numbers of individuals in the dietary intake extremes
(30). These results are still generalizable to those at highest risk

1736 Sun et al.

of developing esophageal adenocarcinoma and gastric cardia
adenocarcinoma, because the majority of the NIH-AARP cohort
consists of non-Hispanic white men and the rates of esophageal
adenocarcinoma and gastric cardia adenocarcinoma are high-
est in this racial/ethnic group (63). However, studies show that
rates of head and neck cancer (64), esophageal squamous cell
carcinoma, and noncardia gastric adenocarcinoma (63) are
higher among black men. Thus, the results from our study may
not be generalizable to individuals at the highest risk for these
cancer types.

Strengths of our study include its large sample size and long
follow-up, which yielded large numbers of outcomes for these
rare cancer types. In addition, we utilized the USDA expanded
ﬂavonoid database, which included a greater scope of foods than
used in previous studies and also accounts for cooking methods
not previously accounted for in the USDA ﬂavonoid databases.
Our use of this updated and expanded ﬂavonoid database
improves the accuracy of our intake measurement.

Another strength of our study is its prospective cohort design,
which minimizes differential information bias from self-reported
dietary intake compared with previous case-control studies. In
addition, the data collected from the FFQs administered in the
NIH-AARP cohort were validated against 2 nonconsecutive
24-h dietary recalls, administered within a year of the baseline
questionnaire to a stratiﬁed random sample of participants (54).
Deattenuated ﬂavonoid correlation coefﬁcients were 0.57 for
men and 0.65 for women (65), which are consistent with other
macro- and micronutrients examined in the NIH-AARP study
(40, 54).

In conclusion, our ﬁndings suggest that dietary intake of
ﬂavonoids is associated with a lower risk of head and neck
cancers. This evidence suggests that dietary ﬂavonoids could
potentially be used as a risk reduction strategy for individuals at
high risk of head and neck cancer to reduce the incidence of these
highly fatal cancers. However, further laboratory, clinical, and
epidemiologic research is warranted before deﬁnitive conclu-
sions can be drawn about the chemopreventive potential, or lack
thereof, of dietary ﬂavonoids and upper gastrointestinal cancers.
