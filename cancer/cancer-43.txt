Abstract

Background: Diet is known to inﬂuence systemic inﬂammation, a recognized risk factor for colorectal cancer (CRC).

Studies in ethnically diverse populations that examine the association between dietary inﬂammatory potential and CRC

incidence are limited.

Objectives: We used the Dietary Inﬂammatory Index to clarify the relation between the inﬂammatory potential of diet and

CRC incidence across racial/ethnic groups. We hypothesized that proinﬂammatory diets would be associated with an

increased risk of CRC, and that these associations may differ across racial/ethnic groups.

Methods: The Multiethnic Cohort (MEC) follows a prospective study design. It includes 190,963 white, African-American,

native Hawaiian, Japanese-American, and Latino men and women aged 45–75 y at recruitment and followed over 20 y.

Participants completed a food frequency questionnaire from which energy-adjusted Dietary Inﬂammatory Index (E-DII) scores

were computed and categorized into quartiles. CRC incidence was documented through linkage to cancer registry programs.

Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate HRs and 95% CIs, adjusting for known or expected CRC risk factors.

Results: Among all participants, more-proinﬂammatory diets (highest quartile compared with lowest quartile) were

associated with an increased risk of CRC (HR: 1.21; 95% CI: 1.11, 1.32). However, the effect size was larger for men

(HR: 1.28; 95% CI: 1.13, 1.45) than for women (HR: 1.16; 95% CI: 1.02, 1.33), although the interaction term for sex was not
statistically signiﬁcant (P-interaction = 0.17). When stratiﬁed by race/ethnicity, the association was signiﬁcantly different
between groups for men (P-interaction = 0.01), although not for women (P-interaction = 0.20). Signiﬁcant associations with

HRs ranging from 2.33 to 1.04 were observed in white, Japanese-American, and Latino men, and native Hawaiian women.

Conclusions: Overall, more-proinﬂammatory diets, as identiﬁed by the E-DII, were associated with increased CRC risk in

MEC participants across racial/ethnic groups. This study adds to the evidence suggesting that diets with high proinﬂammatory
potential may increase CRC risk. J Nutr 2017;147:430–8.

Introduction

Colorectal cancer (CRC)9 is the third most commonly diagnosed
cancer in the United States (1–3). A number of risk factors have
been described for CRC,
including family history, obesity,
excessive alcohol consumption, tobacco use, low intake of dietary
ﬁber or calcium, high red or processed meat intake, physical
inactivity, and chronic inﬂammation (3). In recent decades,
research on the biological link between chronic inﬂammation,
diet, and CRC incidence has grown (4–6).

Inﬂammation represents a naturally occurring acute immune
response that aids the body in healing wounds and ﬁghting
infection (7, 8). Although acute inﬂammation is consistent with

good health, chronic inﬂammation is implicated in the onset and
progression of cancer (9–11), with evidence of this effect being
strongest for CRC (5). Epidemiologic evidence shows that the
incidence of CRC is higher in individuals with inﬂammatory
bowel disease (5, 12), whereas prolonged use of nonsteroidal
anti-inﬂammatory drugs is shown to reduce risk (13).

Diet is an acknowledged set of CRC risk factors (14) in part
because of its role in regulating inﬂammation (15). Diets rich in
fruits and vegetables are associated with a reduction in CRC risk
(16); whereas diets high in fat, added sugar, and protein are
associated with increased inﬂammation (17, 18) and increased
risk of CRC (16). Although research shows links between diet

and inﬂammation (17, 18), and between chronic inﬂammation
and the development of cancer (4, 19), the complexity of these
relations is not yet fully understood. Dietary pattern analyses
based on the recently developed Dietary Inﬂammatory Index
(DII) may help clarify the relation between the overall inﬂam-
matory potential of individual diets and CRC incidence (20, 21).
The DII distinguishes dietary patterns on a continuum from
anti-inﬂammatory to proinﬂammatory, where a higher, more
positive DII score indicates a more proinﬂammatory diet and a
lower, more negative score indicates a more anti-inﬂammatory
diet (21). Higher DII scores have been linked to both inﬂammatory
biomarkers (22–24) and a greater risk of CRC (25–29). To date,
most DII research has been applied in examinations of primarily
European and European-American populations (23, 25, 26, 28).
Associations between diet and disease incidence are known to
vary across diverse populations (30, 31). Also, major dietary
exposures are known to differ between racial and ethnic groups
(32). However, with respect to the incidence of CRC, little work
has been done to understand the role of proinﬂammatory diets in
nonwhite populations. Therefore, this study used the DII to
examine the relation between the inﬂammatory potential of
dietary intake and CRC incidence within the Multiethnic Cohort
(MEC), which consists of a large (>215,000 participants), racially
and ethnically diverse population that has been followed for >20 y.
We hypothesized that participants with more-proinﬂammatory
diets (i.e., higher DII scores) would have a greater risk of CRC and
that these associations may differ across the racial/ethnic groups
represented in the MEC (African-American, Japanese-American,
Latino, native Hawaiian, and white participants).

Methods

Study population. The MEC is a prospective cohort study investigating
the association of lifestyle and genetic factors with the incidence of
cancer and other diseases. The studyÕs design and implementation have
been described previously (33). Brieﬂy, 215,000 men and women living
in Hawaii or the Los Angeles area and 45–75 y old at recruitment were
enrolled from 1993 to 1996. To obtain a multiethnic sample of African-
American, Japanese-American, Latino, native Hawaiian, and white
participants, driverÕs license ﬁles, voter registration lists, and Medicare
ﬁles were used to identify potential participants. The institutional review
boards at the University of Hawaii and the University of Southern
California approved the study protocol.

Colon and rectal cancer cases were identiﬁed through regular
linkages with the Los Angeles County Cancer Surveillance Program,
the State of California Cancer Registry, and the statewide Hawaii Tumor
the National Cancer InstituteÕs Surveillance,
Registry, all part of
Epidemiology, and End Results program. Migration to other states has
been low in the MEC (7% at 10 y); therefore, Hawaii and California
tumor registries cover the vast majority of incident cases, and this has
been veriﬁed through Medicare linkage. Dates of death were identiﬁed
by routine linkages with California and Hawaii vital records and the
National Death Index databases. Complete case and/or death ascertain-
ment was available up to 31 December 2010. Participants who identiﬁed
as not being a member of 1 of the 5 major racial/ethnic groups (n = 13,988),
who had a prevalent diagnosis of CRC at cohort entry either by self-report
or registry information (n = 2564), or who had implausible dietary data
(n = 8137) were excluded from this analysis. This left a remaining
population of 190,963, with 4388 invasive colorectal adenocarcinoma
cases (3372 colon, 981 rectum, and 35 with both colon and rectum) being
identiﬁed. The 297 incident CRC cases with other histologies were censored
at their date of diagnosis.

Data collection. Upon entry into the cohort, participants completed a 26-
page baseline questionnaire. The questionnaire included questions on
demographics, height and weight, personal and family medical history,
family history of CRC, and physical activity, and a quantitative FFQ with
>180 items, which has been described previously (33–35). The FFQ
assessed usual intake over the previous year with the use of 8 response
categories (‘‘never or hardly ever’’ to ‘‘2 or more times a day’’), and, for
some beverage items, 9 response categories (‘‘never or hardly ever’’ to ‘‘4 or
more times a day’’). Three portion sizes speciﬁc to each food item, shown
as representative images, were used to assess quantity of food eaten. The
FFQ was validated and calibrated in each race/ethnicity–sex group with
the use of data from 1606 participants and 3 randomly scheduled 24-h
dietary recalls (34). The MEC FFQ had several unique attributes, including
the presence of ethnic-speciﬁc foods, reliance on a food composition table
speciﬁc to the MEC, and use of a large recipe database (36).

DII. The development and construct validation of the DII have been
described previously (21, 22). Brieﬂy, nearly 2000 peer-reviewed articles
published through 2010 on the association between diet and 6 inﬂamma-
tory markers (i.e., C-reactive protein, IL-1b, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-a)
were reviewed and scored to determine an inﬂammatory effect score. In
this process, 45 food components were identiﬁed as having a sufﬁciently
robust literature linking to $1 of the 6 markers. Not all of the 45 food
components were available in the MEC data. Food components included
in the DII calculation in the MEC were carbohydrate; protein; total fat;
saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated fats; v-3 and v-6 FAs;
alcohol; ﬁber; cholesterol; vitamins A, B-6, B-12, C, D, and E; thiamin;
riboﬂavin; niacin; iron; magnesium; zinc; selenium; folate; b-carotene;
isoﬂavones; and caffeine. Food components not included were eugenol,
garlic, ginger, onion, trans fat, turmeric, green tea, black tea, falan-3-ol,
ﬂavones, ﬂavonols, ﬂavonones, anthocyanins, pepper, thyme, oregano,
and rosemary. Unavailable food components were dropped from the DII
calculation for the MEC. Only intake from foods, and not from
supplements, was used in the DII calculations.

The DII was standardized to its current range with the use of dietary
intake from surveys or studies in 11 countries, which were compiled to
provide a reference mean 6 SD intake value for each food component
(21). A z score was created for each food component for each participant
by subtracting the reference mean from the actual food component
intake value and then dividing the difference by the reference SD. To
minimize the effect of right skewing and to center the distribution on 0
(null), with a lower bound of 21 (maximally anti-inﬂammatory) and
upper bound of +1 (maximally proinﬂammatory), these z scores were
then converted to a centered proportion score. This was achieved by
doubling the z score expressed on a scale of 0 to 1 and then subtracting 1.
The product of each food component–speciﬁc centered proportion score
and inﬂammatory effect score was calculated and summed for all food
components, which created the overall DII score. DII calculations are
based on the intake of each food component as expressed per 1000 kcal
consumed, also known as the energy-adjusted Dietary Inﬂammatory

Index (E-DII) (37–40). A higher DII score indicates a more proin-
ﬂammatory diet and a lower score indicates a more anti-inﬂammatory
diet. The E-DII scores within the MEC were converted to quartiles with
the following ranges: quartile 1 = 26.64 to 23.66; quartile 2 = 23.65 to
22.32; quartile 3 = 22.31 to 20.53; and quartile 4 = 20.52 to 4.95.
Although the range of scores for the E-DII may be similar to the DII
scores in the literature (39), they cannot be compared directly, because
the E-DII scores take into account nutrient density of the diet.

Statistical analysis. Analyses were performed with the use of SAS
version 9.4. Frequencies or means 6 SDs were calculated for participant
characteristics at baseline. Variables investigated as possible confounders
included previous disease diagnoses (i.e., heart attack, diabetes, hyper-
tension, and others), use of dietary supplements, smoking status, year of
enrollment, family history of CRC, hormone use (i.e., estrogen or
progesterone), aspirin use, average sleep duration, physical activity (in
metabolic equivalents), location (i.e., Hawaii or Los Angeles), marital status,
education, age at cohort entry, and BMI (kg/m2). The categories used in
modeling are the same as those given in Table 1.

Sex and race/ethnicity were investigated for their role as effect modiﬁers.
Minimally adjusted models were computed with the use of age, sex, and
race as STRATA variables. Model confounder selection was determined
with a series of bivariable Cox proportional hazards regressions (i.e., the
E-DII + potential covariate). All covariates with a P value # 0.20, along
with the E-DII score, were included in a saturated adjustment model. A ﬁnal
adjustment model was created by including only covariates that, when
removed, led to a $10% change in the HR of the E-DII and those that
were statistically signiﬁcant (P < 0.05) in the saturated model. However,
hormone use (for women) and aspirin use were retained in the model
regardless of signiﬁcance because of their direct impact on inﬂammation
(13, 41). See footnotes of tables for ﬁnal model speciﬁcations.

To examine the relation between the E-DII scores and CRC
incidence, Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate
HRs and 95% CIs. Time (in years) elapsed since study entry was used as
the time metric. The referent category was the lowest quartile (quartile 1)
for E-DII, with the primary comparison of interest being between
quartile 4 and quartile 1. The assumption of proportional hazards was
examined by reviewing cumulative sums of Martingale residuals (42).
The proportional hazards assumption was met by the E-DII; however,
several covariates did not meet the assumptions. The STRATA statement
in the PHREG procedure in SAS was then used for these covariates,
along with age, sex, and race/ethnicity, because of the different
underlying risk curves for these groups (Tables 2–4, footnotes). Addition-
ally, tests for trend across E-DII quartiles were performed with the use of the
median E-DII value per quartile as a continuous measure. For all models,
the E-DII also was analyzed as a continuous variable in order to express the
HRs per unit increase (i.e., ;7% of its maximum range) in the E-DII.

All analyses were performed separately by sex and then by sex and
race/ethnicity. Additionally, for women, stratiﬁcations by hormone use
(i.e., not using, previously used, or currently using) were investigated.
CRC incidence by anatomical location (colon, rectum, or both) and
disease stage at diagnosis category (local, regional, or distant) were
analyzed as additional outcomes. Lastly, in a sensitivity analysis to
investigate the effect of preclinical disease on our ﬁndings, cases
diagnosed within 3 y of enrollment were removed (n = 770), and the
main models were rerun.

Results

A total of 190,963 participants were included in the analyses. The
distribution of participant characteristics across increasing quar-
tiles of the E-DII is provided in Table 1. A lower percentage of
women (18%) and a higher percentage of men (34%) were in
E-DII quartile 4 (most proinﬂammatory) compared with the other
quartiles. White and African-American participants were equally
distributed across the quartiles; however, native Hawaiians had
the largest percentage in quartile 4 (35%). Quartile 4 included
lower percentages of participants who were graduate-school

educated (19%), nonsmokers (19%), supplement users (19%),
and women who reported currently or previously using hor-
mones, particularly estrogen (16% and 15%, respectively).
Participants in quartile 4 also were younger (57.4 6 8.8 y) and
had a higher BMI (27.0 6 5.3) than did participants in quartile
1 (62.0 6 8.5 y and 26.0 6 4.9, respectively). Only 18% of
participants who reported a past diagnosis of diabetes were in
quartile 4 compared with 31% in quartile 1.

In our analysis of CRC incidence (Table 2), a more
proinﬂammatory diet (quartile 4 compared with quartile 1) was
associated with an increased risk of CRC (HR: 1.21; 95% CI:
1.11, 1.32; P-trend <0.01) for all participants. The P value for
the interaction between sex and the E-DII was 0.17, and analyses
that used sex-speciﬁc quartiles showed no differences from the
results presented here. The association for quartile 4 compared
with quartile 1 was statistically signiﬁcant in men (HR: 1.28;
95% CI: 1.13, 1.45; P-trend <0.01) and in women (HR: 1.16;
95% CI: 1.02, 1.33; P-trend = 0.13); however, the association
across quartiles was not signiﬁcant for women, as indicated by
the nonsigniﬁcant P-trend. When examining the E-DII as a
continuous measure, a 1-unit increase in the E-DII score was
associated with a 4% (95% CI for HR: 1.02, 1.06), 5% (95% CI
for HR: 1.03, 1.07), and 2% (95% CI for HR: 1.00, 1.05)
increase in CRC risk in all participants, men, and women,
respectively. After removal of cases diagnosed <3 y after
baseline, results were unchanged for men. The association for
women also was similar, but no longer statistically signiﬁcant
(HR: 1.14; 95% CI: 0.99, 1.32).

When analyses were stratiﬁed by race/ethnicity for men
(E-DII by race/ethnicity interaction, P = 0.01) and for women
(P = 0.20), a more proinﬂammatory diet was associated with an
increased risk of CRC across groups (Table 3), although the
association for women was not statistically signiﬁcant for most
of the racial/ethnic groups. The HRs for quartile 4 compared
with quartile 1 of the E-DII ranged from 0.86 to 1.72 in men and
from 0.98 to 2.33 in women. The largest increase in risk was
seen in native Hawaiian women (quartile 4 compared with
quartile 1, HR: 2.33; 95% CI: 1.38, 3.93; P-trend <0.01) and
Latino men (HR: 1.72; 95% CI: 1.26, 2.34; P-trend <0.01).
Statistically signiﬁcant increases in risk also were seen for white
men (HR: 1.39; 95% CI: 1.04, 1.84; P-trend = 0.08) and Japanese-
American men (HR: 1.25; 95% CI: 1.02, 1.53; P-trend = 0.01).
A statistically signiﬁcant increase in CRC risk per 1-unit increase
in the E-DII was observed for white, Japanese-American, and
Latino men, as well as for native Hawaiian women (Table 3). After
removal of cases diagnosed <3 y after baseline, there were no
differences, except that the association for Japanese-American
men was no longer statistically signiﬁcant (HR: 1.18; 95% CI:
0.94, 1.47).

Analyses conducted separately for colon and rectal cancers
showed positive associations between a proinﬂammatory diet
and disease risk regardless of location and stage at diagnosis
(Table 4). The association was similar for colon cancer
(HR: 1.20; 95% CI: 1.09, 1.33; P-trend < 0.01) and rectal cancer
(HR: 1.22; 95% CI: 0.1.02, 1.47; P-trend = 0.01). Positive
associations were found between quartile 4 and quartile 1 for
advanced CRC (distant spread) (HR: 1.40; 95% CI: 1.11, 1.77;
P-trend = 0.01), regional CRC (HR: 1.24; 95% CI: 1.08, 1.43;
P-trend < 0.01) and, to a lesser extent, localized CRC (HR: 1.14;
95% CI: 1.00, 1.31; P-trend = 0.07). The association across
quartiles was not signiﬁcant for localized CRC, as indicated by
the nonsigniﬁcant P-trend. The associations that used the
continuous form of the E-DII were statistically signiﬁcant for all
locations and stages examined. A 1-unit increase in the E-DII was

associated with a 5% (95% CI for HR: 1.01, 1.08) and 4% (95%
CI for HR: 1.02, 1.06) increase in risk of rectal and colon cancers,
respectively. The increase in CRC risk associated with a 1-unit
increase in the E-DII ranged from 7% (95% CI for HR: 1.03,
1.11) for distant disease to 3% (95% CI for HR: 1.01, 1.06) for
local disease. After removal of cases diagnosed <3 y after follow-
up, the association for localized disease remained the same, but
was nonsigniﬁcant (HR: 1.14; 95% CI: 0.99, 1.33).

Discussion

Unlike other dietary patterns and diet-quality indexes, the DII
was designed to assess dietary quality based on a biological
mechanism (i.e., inﬂammation), which makes it particularly
important in examining the role of diet and risk of CRC. This
analysis is the ﬁrst to examine associations between the E-DII

and CRC risk across racial/ethnic groups. In this examination of
data from the MEC, a more proinﬂammatory diet was associated
with an increased risk of CRC in men and, to a lesser degree, in
women. The analysis of the E-DII stratiﬁed by sex and race/ethnicity
was statistically signiﬁcant for white, Japanese-American, and
Latino men, as well as native Hawaiian women. The strongest
associations were seen in native Hawaiian women and Latino men,
in whom a more proinﬂammatory diet was associated with an
increased risk of CRC. Increased risks of both colon and rectal
cancers also were observed with a more proinﬂammatory diet, as
was a greater risk of more advanced cancers.

The DII and its association with CRC have been examined in
several cohort and case-control studies (25–29). To our knowl-
edge, this is one of the ﬁrst DII-CRC studies to use the method of
adjusting the DII for energy intake; so although E-DII scores in
this study had a range similar to previous studies, absolute scores

are not directly comparable. Both the WomenÕs Health Initiative
and the Iowa WomenÕs Health Study found that women who
consumed the most proinﬂammatory diets had an ;20%
increased risk of CRC compared with women who consumed
the most anti-inﬂammatory diets (25, 26). In the Iowa WomenÕs
Health Study, when the DII was based on food without the
inclusion of supplements, the association was weaker and not
statistically signiﬁcant for the highest quintile compared with the
lowest quintile (25). In this analysis within the MEC, the
calculation of the E-DII also included foods only, and a 16%
increase in risk of CRC was seen in women for the highest
compared with the lowest quartile; however, the association was
no longer statistically signiﬁcant after cases diagnosed within the
ﬁrst 3 y of follow-up were excluded.

Examinations of the DII in the NIH–American Association of
Retired Persons (NIH-AARP) Diet and Health Study, as well as a

case-control study in Italy, included both men and women. In the
NIH-AARP study, a statistically signiﬁcant increased risk of
CRC with consumption of a more proinﬂammatory diet was
observed in men, but not in women (28). In the Italian case-
control study, the increased risk of CRC with a more
proinﬂammatory diet was statistically signiﬁcant for men and
women, with the association being stronger for men (29). The
reasons some analyses of the DII and CRC risk show weaker or
nonsigniﬁcant results for women are not clear. Given evidence
that hormone use may play a strong role in CRC risk in women
(41), we explored whether associations between the E-DII and
CRC risk differed for women who were not using, previously
used, or were currently using estrogen and progesterone therapy.
No differences were seen between groups deﬁned by hor-
mone use. Analyses of other diet-quality indexes and CRC also
found inconsistent results in women compared with those in

men (43, 44). Both of the previous studies noted dairy as an
index component that contributed toward protective effects for
women and CRC risk (43, 44). Dietary calcium and vitamin D
have been identiﬁed as potentially important in reducing CRC
risk (45); however, although the DII accounts for vitamin D in its
calculation, because of its methods of construction, it does not
include calcium (21, 22).

When E-DII quartiles were examined for the various sex–
racial/ethnic groups present in the MEC, the increased risk of
CRC with a proinﬂammatory diet appeared greatest for native
Hawaiian women and Latino men. Previous examinations of
hypothetically derived dietary intake patterns in participants in
the MEC found that native Hawaiian and Latino participants
had higher odds of being in the ‘‘fat and meat’’ dietary pattern
than did white participants (30). This pattern was characterized
by a higher intake of discretionary fat and meat, including organ
and processed meats, as well as a higher intake of white

potatoes, nonwhole grains, eggs, and cheese (30). An examina-
tion of the correlation between the E-DII and red and processed
meat found the association to be relatively weak (r = 0.14), but
signiﬁcant (P < 0.0001). An examination of the DII food
components showed that Latino men had a higher mean intake
of protein per 1000 kcal than did the other racial/ethnic groups
for men (Supplemental Table 1). Native Hawaiian women did
not show a higher intake of meat and fat per 1000 kcal than did
other women when the DII food components were examined;
however, their mean intake per 1000 kcal of a variety of other
food components (e.g., ﬁber, magnesium, vitamin A, folic acid,
and b-carotene) was lower than that of the other racial/ethnic
groups for women (Supplemental Table 1).

In this study, a statistically signiﬁcant increase in risk of both
colon and rectal cancers was observed in quartile 4 compared
with quartile 1 of the E-DII. Although ﬁndings related to colon
cancer have been consistent, other studies have been mixed with

regard to an increased risk of rectal cancer with a more
proinﬂammatory diet (25–29). Although cancers classiﬁed as
both colon and rectal were included in the rectal cancer category
for this study, they totaled only 35 cases, and their inclusion is in
line with other analyses that have examined DII scores in
relation to rectal cancer (26, 28). To our knowledge, few studies
have examined the DII and stage of disease. A statistically
signiﬁcant increase in risk of cancers categorized as regional and
distant was seen in our analyses. Participants with E-DII scores
in quartile 4 had a 25% increased risk of regional disease and a
43% increased risk of distant disease compared with those in
quartile 1. Although the magnitude of risk was higher in the
NIH-AARP analysis than in this study, the same trend was seen,
suggesting a connection between more advanced disease and a
more proinﬂammatory diet (28).

Limitations of this study include the small number of CRC
cases in certain subgroups (e.g., native Hawaiians). In addition,
analyses were based on a single assessment of diet at baseline.
However, changes in diet over time for adults may be minimal
and have little effect on CRC risk (46–48). The MEC dietary
data included only 28 of the 45 food components used to
calculate the DII. The use of fewer variables can lead to skewing
toward the right for DII values. However, E-DII scores are
generally low (more anti-inﬂammatory) in the MEC. Further-
more, the DII has been calculated with the use of as few as 19
food components. Validation studies have shown that the
statistical relation is unchanged when fewer food components
are included compared with a larger or full set of DII food
components, and the DIIÕs predictive abilities with regard to
inﬂammatory markers are not reduced (22–24). Differences in
dietary intake reporting (49, 50), social desirability (51), or
the etiology of CRC may exert sex-differential effects on the
associations seen between the DII and CRC risk. Among
commonly used socioeconomic status variables, only education
was available in the MEC, which limited our ability to adjust
analyses for such factors. In addition, factors such as screening
behaviors may affect overall and early detection of CRC. CRC
screening participation by sex and race/ethnicity has previously
been examined in the MEC (52). Although women had lower
E-DII scores than did men in this study, men were more likely to
be screened for CRC than were women, and all racial/ethnic
groups, especially native Hawaiians and Mexican-born Latinos,
were less likely to be screened than were white subjects (52).
These ﬁndings differ from the patterns seen in associations
between the E-DII and CRC incidence, suggesting that partic-
ipants in the MEC with more-proinﬂammatory diets are not
necessarily also less likely to adopt other preventive behaviors.
These study limitations and the multifactorial nature of cancer
limits our ability to make statements of causality.

Despite its limitations, the study has several strengths. The MEC
is a large population-based cohort with a well-established history of
research demonstrating associations between diet and cancer across
racial/ethnic groups. To our knowledge, this examination is the ﬁrst
to look at potential differences across racial/ethnic groups in
associations between the E-DII and CRC. The study also adds to
the literature on CRC risk in men, by anatomic location and by
severity of disease. More research is needed to understand the
inconsistent results across studies of diet and CRC risk for women
and whether our ﬁndings across racial/ethnic groups can be
replicated in other multiethnic populations.
