Abstract

One promising approach for early detection of lung cancer is by monitoring gene promoter hypermethyla-
tion events in sputum. Epidemiologic studies suggest that dietary fruits and vegetables and the micronutrients
they contain may reduce risk of lung cancer. In this study, we evaluated whether diet and multivitamin use
influenced the prevalence of gene promoter methylation in cells exfoliated from the aerodigestive tract of
current and former smokers. Members (N = 1,101) of the Lovelace Smokers Cohort completed the Harvard
Food Frequency Questionnaire and provided a sputum sample that was assessed for promoter methyla-
tion of eight genes commonly silenced in lung cancer and associated with risk for this disease. Methyl-
ation status was categorized as low (fewer than two genes methylated) or high (two or more genes
methylated). Logistic regression models were used to identify associations between methylation status
and 21 dietary variables hypothesized to affect the acquisition of gene methylation. Significant protection
against methylation was observed for leafy green vegetables [odds ratio (OR) = 0.83 per 12 monthly servings; 95%
confidence interval (95% CI), 0.74–0.93] and folate (OR, 0.84 per 750 μg/d; 95% CI, 0.72–0.99). Protection against
gene methylation was also seen with current use of multivitamins (OR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.40–0.83). This is the first
cohort-based study to identify dietary factors associated with reduced promoter methylation in cells exfo-
liated from the airway epithelium of smokers. Novel interventions to prevent lung cancer should be developed
based on the ability of diet and dietary supplements to affect reprogramming of the epigenome. Cancer Res;

Introduction

Lung cancer, the leading cause of cancer-related death in
the United States, occurs largely from chronic exposure to
tobacco carcinogens (1). The development of this disease
over 30 to 40 years involves field cancerization, characterized
as the acquisition of genetic and epigenetic changes through-
out the respiratory epithelium (2, 3). The silencing of genes
through promoter hypermethylation is now recognized as a
major and causal epigenetic event that occurs during lung
cancer initiation and progression to affect the function of
hundreds of genes. Gene silencing involves methylation of cy-

tosines in the gene promoter region, recruitment of tran-
scriptional corepressors, and modification of histone tails
that culminate in the establishment of chromatin modifica-
tions that block transcription (4, 5). Genes involved in all as-
pects of normal cell function, such as regulating the cell
cycle, differentiation, adhesion, and death, are silenced in
lung tumors (3). Importantly, the tumor suppressor gene
p16, which plays a critical role in regulating the cell cycle,
is not only commonly silenced by methylation in lung cancer
but also inactivated early in the development of this disease.
Silencing of p16 and other genes is detected in bronchial ep-
ithelium of smokers and in precursor lesions to adenocarci-
noma and squamous cell carcinoma and increases during
disease progression, substantiating a vital role for gene si-
lencing in lung cancer etiology (6–8).

Based on the silencing of key tumor suppressor genes in the
lungs of smokers, we hypothesized that the detection of gene-
specific promoter hypermethylation in exfoliated cells in
sputum would provide an assessment of the extent of field can-
cerization that in turn may predict early lung cancer. This
hypothesis has been validated in two studies, the first detecting
methylation of the p16 and MGMT genes in sputum up to 3
years before clinical diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma (9).
The second study, a nested, case-control study of incident
lung cancer cases from a high-risk cohort, identified six genes
associated with >50% increased lung cancer risk. Importantly,

concomitant methylation of three or more of these six genes
was associated with a 6.5-fold increased risk of incident lung
cancer and sensitivity and specificity both at 64% (10). These
studies suggested that gene promoter hypermethylation in spu-
tum could be used as a molecular marker for identifying people
at high risk for cancer incidence (11). However, the precise
mechanism by which carcinogens disrupt the capacity of cells
to maintain the epigenetic code during DNA replication and re-
pair is largely unknown.

The fact that gene promoter methylation is a promising
marker for lung cancer makes understanding factors that in-
fluence the propensity for this epigenetic process throughout
the respiratory epithelium a high priority because such
knowledge could be used not only for early detection but also
to identify persons who would benefit most from chemopre-
vention. The precise mechanism by which carcinogens dis-
rupt the capacity of cells to maintain the epigenetic code
during DNA replication and repair is largely unknown. Carci-
nogens within tobacco induce single- and double-strand
breaks in DNA, and reduced DNA repair capacity (DRC)
has been associated with lung cancer (12). Accumulating ev-
idence from our group suggests that extensive DNA damage
could be responsible for acquisition of gene promoter hyper-
methylation during lung carcinogenesis (3, 13). Strong sup-
port for this supposition was provided through a recent
community-based study in which a highly significant associ-
ation was seen between DRC and sequence variants within
specific DNA repair genes and the propensity for methylation
of genes detected in sputum from cancer-free smokers from
the Lovelace Smokers Cohort (14). Specifically, smokers with
a high methylation index (defined by having three or more
genes methylated from an eight-gene panel in sputum) had
a 50% reduction in DRC compared with smokers with no
genes methylated in sputum. Single nucleotide polymorph-
isms within five double-strand break DNA repair genes were
also highly associated with methylation index. This study
suggests that chronic DNA damage coupled with reduced
DRC could be an important determinant for inducing gene
promoter hypermethylation.

Epidemiologic studies suggest that select dietary nutrients
and vitamin supplements might protect against lung cancer
(15). Fruits, vegetables, and multivitamins all possess antiox-
idant activity that should reduce tobacco-induced DNA
damage. In addition, folate, a B vitamin, is metabolized to
5-methyltetrahydrofolate that provides methyl groups for S-
adenosylmethionine (SAM), a universal donor for reactions
that include methylation of DNA (16). Low folate has been as-
sociated with reduced DRC and an increase in prevalence for
gene promoter methylation (17, 18). The purpose of the cur-
rent investigation was to determine whether diet and multi-
vitamin use influence the presence of methylation in cells
exfoliated from the aerodigestive tract of current and former
smokers. Composite variables were selected based on our hy-
potheses that fruits, tomatoes, cruciferous vegetables, leafy
vegetables, yellow vegetables, and vitamin intake will be asso-
ciated with a reduction in number of genes methylated in
sputum, whereas animal fat and red and processed meat will
be associated with increased methylation.

Dietary Factors Protect against Gene Methylation in Smokers

Materials and Methods

Study population. The Lovelace Smokers Cohort began re-
cruitment of female smokers in 2001 and expanded to in-
clude male smokers in 2004 (14). Enrollment, which is still
ongoing, is restricted to current and former smokers ages
40 to 75 y with a minimum of 15 pack-years of smoking. Par-
ticipants primarily are residents of the Albuquerque, New
Mexico metropolitan area. Participants complete a standard
questionnaire covering demographics, smoking history, per-
sonal and family health, and a food frequency questionnaire.
Weight and height are measured. Participants provide both
blood and sputum samples and undergo standard pulmonary
function testing. A total of 1,145 people completed a food fre-
quency questionnaire and were assessed for prevalence for
methylation of eight genes in sputum. Those with caloric in-
take outside of gender-specific bounds (n = 44) were exclud-
ed, resulting in a total of 1,101 participants (845 women and
256 men) in this study. All participants signed a consent
form, and the Western Institutional Review Board approved
this project.

Dietary questionnaire. Participants completed the adult
version of the Harvard University Food Frequency Question-
naire Dietary Assessment form, a self-administered instru-
ment that includes ∼150 food items (19). The participant
indicates consumption frequency for most food items by
choosing 1 of 5 to 10 categories that vary depending on the
food item and can range from never to six or more servings
per day. A food group analysis was conducted to combine
food items to obtain estimates of intake of macronutrients
and micronutrients. We focused on factors known or sus-
pected of being associated with lung cancer or methylation.
Thus, the macronutrients animal fat and total fat and the
micronutrients vitamin C, vitamin E, folate (that included
supplements and fortified foods), carotene, α-carotene, β-
carotene, lycopene, lutein and zeaxanthin, and retinol were
examined. Alcohol, multivitamins, and cod liver oil intake
were also assessed as categorical variables. In a study of
eating patterns, Fung and colleagues (20) created a set of
38 composite variables using the food frequency question-
naire. Six of these composite variables, red and processed
meats, fruit, tomatoes, cruciferous vegetables, leafy green
vegetables, and yellow vegetables, were related to our hy-
potheses, so we calculated these variables.

Total caloric intake was assessed. People with either ex-
tremely low (n = 8) or extremely high (n = 36) intake were
excluded. Cutoffs for extremely low intake were <500 and
<800 calories for women and men, respectively. Extremely
high intake was defined as >3,500 and >4,200 calories for
women and men, respectively. It is standard to exclude par-
ticipants with at least 70 missing items on the food frequency
questionnaire, but none of our participants met this criteri-
on. Participants with missing data on individual food items
were excluded from analyses of these items.

Methylation-specific PCR. Eight genes (p16, MGMT, DAPK,
RASSF1A, PAX5α, PAX5β, GATA4, and GATA5) were selected
for analysis of methylation in sputum based on our previous
studies establishing their association with risk for lung

cancer (10, 21). DNA was isolated from sputum and modified
with bisulfite as described (10). Nested methylation-specific
PCR was used to detect methylated alleles from individual
genes in DNA recovered from the sputum samples as de-
scribed (21). Methylation index, the number of genes meth-
ylated in a sputum sample, was also defined. Sputum from
males and females was randomly selected and included in
batches of 96 samples for assessment of gene methylation.
A Hamilton robot was used to assemble PCRs in 96-well
plates.

Covariates. The questionnaire included questions on
gender, age, ethnicity, and smoking. Cigarette smoking histo-
ry included current status (former or current), pack-years,
and duration of smoking. Body mass index (BMI) was calcu-
lated from measured height and weight and categorized as
normal (<25 kg/m2), overweight (25–29.9 kg/m2), and obese
(≥30 kg/m2). Age was categorized as 40 to 54, 55 to 64, and
≥65 y. Pack-years of smoking were categorized as light (<29),
moderate (30–49), and heavy (≥50).

Statistical methods. Demographic, dietary, and methyla-
tion variables were summarized overall and by gender. Pro-
portions were used for categorical variables and medians
with the interquartile range (IQR) for continuous variables.
Differences between men and women in clinical covariates
and categorical dietary variables were assessed with Fisher's
exact test. For continuous dietary variables, a two-step linear
regression analysis was used to account for differences in to-
tal caloric intake between genders. In the first step, the die-
tary variable was regressed on the total caloric intake. In the
second step, the residuals from the first analysis were re-
gressed on gender, which resulted in an estimate of the dif-
ferences in the mean dietary variable after adjustment for
total caloric intake, along with 95% confidence intervals
(95% CI).

The total number of methylated genes in the eight-gene
panel was dichotomized into low (fewer than two genes
methylated) and high (two or more genes methylated). This
binary outcome, methylation status, was modeled with logis-
tic regression. Initially, only the clinical covariates gender,
age, BMI, and three smoking variables (status, pack-years,
and duration) were assessed. Interactions among the covari-
ates, including interactions with gender, were evaluated. Af-
ter the development of a model with only clinical covariates,
individual dietary variables were included, along with adjust-
ment for total caloric intake. Continuous variables, such as
total fat intake, were included as a continuous variable or
were categorized into quartiles, with the quartiles defined
by gender and the quartile medians used as the predictor va-
lues. Interactions between dietary variables and clinical cov-
ariates were assessed. Only the 21 dietary variables specific to
our hypothesis were examined to reduce the potential for
false-positive results. In addition, no formal adjustment for
multiple comparisons was made to reduce the chance of
false-negative results because this is one of the first studies
to examine the association between dietary factors and
methylation. However, the issue of examining multiple pre-
dictor variables is considered in the interpretation of the re-
sults. Methylation index was also used as the outcome

variable to further assess the association between methyla-
tion and dietary factors. Because the methylation index could
theoretically take on nine values, but actually took on only
seven, it was unclear that linear regression would be appro-
priate. Thus, results obtained from linear and ordinal logistic
regression were compared. The association between signifi-
cant dietary factors and each of the individual genes was ex-
plored using logistic regression models but viewed as
secondary analyses to reduce the issue of multiple compari-
sons. All statistical analyses were conducted in Statistical
Analysis System 9.2.

Results

Population characteristics. The demographics and smok-
ing history of the 1,101 participants are described in Table 1.
The Lovelace Smokers Cohort is largely composed of females
(76.7%) and non-Hispanic whites (77.8%). Median age was 56
years, with males slightly older than females. More than half of
the participants currently smoked, and median duration of
smoking was 33 years. There was no difference between
men and women with regard to smoking status or duration,
but men had significantly higher pack-years of smoking
(median = 39 pack-years for men versus 34 pack-years for
women).

Summary of dietary intake. The completion rate of the
food frequency questionnaire was excellent, as only 2.7% of

participants failed to respond to >10 items. Dietary informa-
tion was compiled for the 21 items of particular interest to
this study and included three macronutrients, nine micronu-
trients, six serving variables, and three categorical variables
(Table 2). The selection of these variables was based on our
hypotheses that fruits, tomatoes, cruciferous vegetables, leafy
vegetables, yellow vegetables, and vitamin intake will be as-
sociated with a reduction in number of genes methylated in
sputum, whereas animal fat and red and processed meat will
be associated with increased methylation. On average, men
had higher intake of total calories, but after adjustment for
caloric intake, women generally had higher consumption of
micronutrients and men had higher consumption of red
meat. There was no difference in vitamin usage, but men

were more likely to report having at least one alcoholic drink
per day.

Prevalence for gene promoter hypermethylation in
sputum. Methylation of an eight-gene panel that included
p16, MGMT, DAPK, RASSF1A, GATA4, GATA5, PAX5α, and
PAX5β was evaluated. Methylation of these genes is associated
with increased risk for lung cancer (10, 21). The prevalence
of methylation ranged from 1.1% and 0.0% for RASSF1A to
33.8% and 51.2% for GATA4 for women and men, respectively
(Table 3). Three genes, MGMT, GATA4, and PAX5α, were more
frequently methylated among men than women (P < 0.001).
Methylation index, the number of methylated genes in each
sputum sample, was higher in men than women (median =
2 and 1, respectively; P < 0.001). Our previous study was

composed largely of male participants and dichotomized
methylation index as fewer than three or three or more
genes methylated in sputum (10). However, because this
study is composed of 77% women who have a lower prev-
alence for gene methylation, high methylation index was de-
fined as two or more genes methylated and was present in
sputum from 36.6% of women and 50.4% of men (P < 0.001).
Association of clinical covariates with gene methylation.
Gender, age, BMI, and cigarette smoking history were as-
sessed in a multivariate model for association with methyla-
tion status. Meaningful interactions, including interactions
between gender and all of the other covariates, were as-
sessed. There were significant interactions between gender
and both BMI (P = 0.04) and pack-years of smoking (P =
0.05). There were relatively more women with high methyla-
tion among obese participants than among both normal
weight and overweight individuals, whereas for men the as-
sociation was less consistent. The odds of high methylation
increased with pack-years among men, but there was no as-
sociation among women. Age and duration of smoking were

not associated with methylation, after adjustment for the
other clinical covariates, but age was retained in the model.
With two other smoking variables included in the model
(pack-years and current status), duration was excluded.
Thus, the clinical covariates that were included in the mod-
eling with the nutritional variables were gender, pack-years
of smoking, current smoking status, BMI, age, and interac-
tions between gender and both pack-years and BMI.

Association of dietary factors with gene methylation.
Each dietary factor was assessed for association with
methylation status (two or more genes methylated versus
fewer than two genes) using logistic regression. A total of
21 variables were examined: three macronutrients, nine mi-
cronutrients, six serving variables, and three categorical
variables (consumption of alcohol, vitamins, and cod liver
oil; Table 4; Supplementary Table S1). Leafy green vegetable
consumption was significantly associated with reduced risk
for high methylation status [odds ratio (OR), 0.83; 95% CI,
0.74–0.93], as was higher folate (OR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.72–0.99;
Table 4). The most striking effect seen was the association
between current multivitamin use and methylation status
(OR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.40–0.83; Table 4). The duration of
vitamin use was not associated with methylation (data
not shown). Moreover, because folate levels were higher
for participants taking multivitamins, stratification by vita-
min use was also conducted and folate remained signifi-
cantly associated with methylation. There was a marginal
increase in odds for methylation associated with total fat
and animal fat that did not reach statistical significance
(Supplementary Table S1). None of the other dietary or
nutrient predictor variables analyzed were associated with
methylation (Supplementary Table S1). Interactions be-
tween each dietary variable and gender were assessed, but
none was significant. The association between these dietary
variables and methylation of the individual genes also was
examined, but because of the number of tests (8 genes × 3
dietary variables = 24 tests), these results were viewed as
exploratory. Associations with at least one of the three sig-
nificant dietary variables were observed for DAPK, GATA4,
PAX5α, and PAX5β (Supplementary Table S2).

A further analysis was conducted to assess whether
any extreme outliers influenced the observed results for

continuous variables by defining quartiles by gender and
then using the medians within the quartiles as predictors
in logistic regression modeling. Similar results were obtained
as in the initial analysis, except that total fat was associated
with marginally increased methylation (OR, 1.43 per 40 g/d;
95% CI, 1.03–1.99). The same dietary variables were identified
to be significant in analyses that used the continuous meth-
ylation index as the outcome. In addition, vitamin E showed
a protective effect for methylation per gene (OR, 0.98 per 20
mg/d; 95% CI, 0.96–1.00; P = 0.04).

Discussion

This is the first cohort-based study to systematically eval-
uate the association between dietary factors and risk for
methylation in cells exfoliated from the aerodigestive tract
of smokers and former smokers. Our findings support a sig-
nificant, biologically plausible role for leafy green vegetables,
folate, and multivitamin use in protection against the acqui-
sition of gene promoter methylation.

There has been considerable interest and debate for dec-
ades about the effect of diet and vitamins on the risk for can-
cer. Recent large epidemiologic studies along with functional
investigations are beginning to provide a clearer picture as to
the dietary variables that may influence risk for cancers such
as lung where a clear causative environmental exposure in
the form of smoking has been established. Reduced folate in-
take has been associated with increased risk for lung cancer
in current and former smokers (22). A link between folate and
gene methylation exists through the role of 5-methyltetrahy-
drofolate in providing methyl groups for SAM, a key methyl
donor in the methylation of DNA. Higher folate has been as-
sociated with a lower prevalence for methylation of individ-
ual and total number of genes in colorectal tumors (17). This
finding was validated in a second study of colorectal tumors
in which folate was inversely associated with gene-specific
promoter hypermethylation (23). Our study shows for the
first time that the acquisition of gene promoter methylation
throughout the airway epithelium is influenced by folate. The
biological mechanisms related to low folate and hypermethy-
lation are still unclear; however, Jhaveri and colleagues (24)
suggested that folate deficiency leads to increased levels of
SAM and S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), an inhibitor of
SAM. The increase in free intracellular SAM could contribute
to gene-specific hypermethylation if an absolute level of SAH
needed to regulate SAM is not maintained. Folate is also in-
volved in DNA repair through de novo synthesis of purines
and pyrimidines, and low dietary folate has been associated
with reduced DRC (18). This observation, combined with our
recent study identifying reduced DRC as a determinant for gene
promoter methylation in sputum (14), suggests that folate may
directly, through affecting the one-carbon pool, and indirectly,
by affecting DRC, affect the propensity for methylation.

Green leafy vegetables were the only food item in this anal-
ysis to exhibit protection against methylation status. Leafy
vegetables are rich in phytochemicals such as vitamin C,
carotenoids, lutein, and folic acid in addition to vitamins A
and K. A comprehensive and systematic review of the litera-

Dietary Factors Protect against Gene Methylation in Smokers

ture up to 2007 by the World Cancer Research Fund (WCRF)
concluded that probable evidence existed for reduction of
lung cancer risk among persons with higher intake of fruits,
whereas evidence was inconclusive about green leafy vegeta-
bles (15). However, a recent hospital-based case-control
study of lung cancer (25) showed a strong protective effect
of green leafy vegetables (OR, 0.5; 95% CI, 0.3–0.81). The lack
of an effect of cruciferous vegetable on methylation status in
our study is not surprising because lung cancer observational
studies report only modest effects that may be influenced by
genetic variation (26). In addition, the lack of association
with red meat and processed meat intake is consistent with
the inconclusive evidence, as summarized by the WCRF (15).
However, a recent cohort study has observed increased risk
for lung cancer among those consuming meats prepared in
ways that would be expected to have increased their carcino-
genicity (27).

In our study, strong protection against gene methylation
was also associated with the use of multivitamins that contain
some of the same agents as leafy green vegetables. Although a
clear connection between vitamin supplements and risk of
lung cancer has not been established (28), vitamin supple-
mentation has been associated with reduction in DNA dam-
age by benzo(a)pyrene, a major tobacco carcinogen (29–32).
The silencing of genes by promoter hypermethylation is
now well established as a major component of lung cancer
initiation and progression and has emerged as a potential
disease marker for early detection. The ability to affect repro-
gramming of the epigenome through diet and chemopreven-
tive supplements could significantly affect mortality from
lung cancer. This study has identified two dietary variables,
leafy green vegetables and folate, along with multivitamin
use that could help reduce the incidence of lung cancer by
reducing the induction of methylation in the aerodigestive
tract of smokers.
