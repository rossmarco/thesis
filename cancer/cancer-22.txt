Abstract

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified 38 larger genetic regions affecting classical blood lipid levels
without adjusting for important environmental influences. We modeled diet and physical activity in a GWAS in order to
identify novel loci affecting total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triglyceride levels. The Swedish (SE)
EUROSPAN cohort (NSE = 656) was screened for candidate genes and the non-Swedish (NS) EUROSPAN cohorts (NNS = 3,282)
were used for replication. In total, 3 SNPs were associated in the Swedish sample and were replicated in the non-Swedish
cohorts. While SNP rs1532624 was a replication of the previously published association between CETP and HDL cholesterol,
the other two were novel findings. For the latter SNPs, the p-value for association was substantially improved by inclusion of
environmental covariates: SNP rs5400 (pSE,unadjusted = 3.661025, pSE,adjusted = 2.261026, pNS,unadjusted = 0.047) in the SLC2A2
(Glucose transporter type 2) and rs2000999 (pSE,unadjusted = 1.161023, pSE,adjusted = 3.861024, pNS,unadjusted = 0.035) in the HP
gene (Haptoglobin-related protein precursor). Both showed evidence of association with total cholesterol. These results
demonstrate that inclusion of important environmental factors in the analysis model can reveal new genetic susceptibility
loci.

Introduction

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified more
than 38 larger genetic regions which influence blood levels of total
cholesterol
(LDL-C),
high-density lipoprotein cholesterol
(HDL-C) and triglycerides
(TG) [1–3]. These studies modeled basic anthropometric con-
founders, such as sex and age, while leaving out
important

low-density lipoprotein cholesterol

(TC),

environmental influences, such as diet and activity. This strategy is
statistically suboptimal since the unexplained variation in the
phenotype can increase the measurement error and as a result
require larger sample sizes to detect a significant effect. Manolio
[4] argued strongly for modeling of environmental covariates in
GWAS and recommended lipid levels as a paradigmatic
phenotype for studying the genetic and environmental architecture
of quantitative traits.

Author Summary

In this article we report a genome-wide association study
on cholesterol
levels in the human blood. We used a
Swedish cohort to select genetic polymorphisms that
showed the strongest association with cholesterol levels
adjusted for diet and physical activity. We replicated
several genetic loci
in other European cohorts. This
approach extends present genome-wide association stud-
ies on lipid levels, which did not take these lifestyle factors
into account, to improve statistical results and discover
novel genes. In our analysis, we could identify two genetic
loci in the SLC2A2 (Glucose transporter type 2) and the HP
(Haptoglobin-related protein precursor) gene whose ef-
fects on total cholesterol have not been reported yet. The
results show that inclusion of important environmental
factors in the analysis model can reveal new insights into
genetic determinants of clinical parameters relevant for
metabolic and cardiovascular disease.

In order to explore the usefulness of including both environ-
mental and genetic factors in the analysis model, we used lipid
measurements from the EUROSPAN study, comprising 3,938
individuals for whom genome-wide SNP data (NSNP = 311,388)
were available [5]. We measured daily intake of food and physical
activity at work and at leisure and modeled the influence of those
environmental covariates on serum lipid levels in a GWAS. First,
data from the Northern Sweden Population Health Study
(NSPHS) were used as a discovery cohort to screen for SNPs
that displayed the lowest p-values when the model was adjusted for
environmental covariates. We then used the other, non-Swedish
EUROSPAN cohorts for replication of our strongest associations
in a candidate gene association study (CGAS).

We chose a population living in northern Sweden for the
selection of candidate loci because it
strong natural
heterogeneity in certain lifestyle factors (e.g. diet, activity), but
homogeneity in other environmental aspects such as climate [6].
Whereas one group is living a modern, sedentary lifestyle found
also in the southern part of Sweden and other western European
countries, a subgroup of Swedes follows a traditional, semi-
nomadic way of life based on reindeer herding. Reindeer herders
typically show higher intake of game meat (reindeer, moose),
which has a high protein and low fat content, and lower intake of
non-game meat,

differences. They also exert more physical activity at work to tend
their reindeer herds, but less activity at leisure [7].

Results

Exploratory GWAS in NSPHS

We performed a GWAS with a lifestyle-adjusted model which
included not only sex and age, but also daily intake of game meat,
non-game meat, fish, milk products, physical activity at work and
at leisure as covariates. We focused on the 0.05% of all SNPs with
the lowest p-values
in the diet- and activity-adjusted model
(corresponding to about 150 SNPs per lipid). For total cholesterol,
88 of these were located in a gene and 14 in genes that have been
associated with energy metabolism (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.
gov/omim/). For LDL-C, 65 SNPs were located in a gene, of
which 8 were functionally relevant. Several of the SNPs for LDL-
C were identical with those affecting total cholesterol, as expected
from the high correlation (r = 0.91) between both phenotypes. For
HDL-C, SNP rs2292883, located in the MLPH gene (Melanophi-
lin), showed a genome-wide significant p-value (p = 1.06610207).

Modeling of Environmental Effects in GWAS

69 SNPs for HDL-C were located in a gene and 14 of those genes
were reported as having a metabolic effect. Finally,
for
triglycerides, 63 SNPs were located in a gene, but only 4 SNPs
in genes with a functional annotation of interest (Table 1 and
Table S1A, S1B, S1C, S1D).

P-value changes

In order to evaluate the effect of including diet and activity
covariates in the association analysis, we overlaid the p-values in
the Manhattan plots from the NSPHS for the unadjusted and
adjusted GWAS models (Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4).
More refined GWAS results separating the effect of adjusting for
either diet or physical activity are presented in Figure S1A, S1B,
S1C, S1D; and Figure S2A, S2B, S2C, S2D. As expected, the
p-values for a number of SNPs were sensitive to the inclusion of
both diet and activity covariates in the model. We matched the
0.05% SNPs with the lowest p-values (top SNP list) between the
unadjusted and the adjusted model. For TC, 83 (53%) SNPs were
found in both top SNP lists. Those lists contained 102 (64%)
identical SNPs for LDL-C and 103 (65%)
for HDL-C. The
analyses resulted in the same 74 (47%) top SNPs for TG levels
(Table S1A, S1B, S1C, S1D). Finally, we compared the p-value
changes of the resulting 39 candidate SNPs that are located in
genes with a metabolic effect between the diet and activity-
adjusted (full) model and the unadjusted (restricted) model
resulting in an up to 27-fold p-value decrease (Table 1).

A food- and activity-adjusted candidate gene association study of
the final 39 candidate SNPs in the Scottish (SC) sample (N = 714) was
applied using similar lifestyle covariates (Table 2; Table S1E, S1F,
S1G, S1H; Table S2). We replicated the effect of rs2000999
(pSC,unadj = 6.16610203, pSC,adj = 4.33610203)
in the HP gene
(Haptoglobin-related protein Precursor) on TC level and the effect
of
in
CETP (Cholesteryl ester transfer protein) on HDL-C. In the Swedish
cohort (SE), the unadjusted genetic effect of rs2000999 in the HP
gene is equivalent to a moderately large difference in average TC
level of 20.21 mg/dl between the homozyguous genotypes (Mean-

We also performed an unadjusted candidate gene analysis of

in a meta-analysis
(Table 2; Table S1I, S1J, S1K, S1L). We confirmed the effects
of rs5400 (pNS = 4.68610202) in SLC2A2 on TC. We again found
that rs2000999 (pNS,unadj = 3.5461022)
in HP influences TC
levels and rs1532624 (pNS,unadj = 2.87610220) in CETP (Choles-

No other associations, including LDL cholesterol or triglycerides

Swedish cohort was not confirmed.

Discussion

Environmental covariates may either act as moderators,
mediators or even suppressors, thereby affecting the discovery of
genetic susceptibility loci
[8,9]. Therefore, we conducted a
GWAS, modeling genetic and important environmental effects,
such as food intake and physical activity, on serum levels of
classical lipids. To our knowledge, this is the first GWAS on blood
lipid levels modeling environmental factors, in particular major
food categories and physical activity, in international cohorts. Our
analysis replicated one known locus in the CETP gene [1] and
in the SLC2A2 and HP gene,
identified two other gene loci
respectively,
involved in energy metabolism but not previously
reported to be associated with cholesterol levels.

SLC2A2 encodes the facilitated glucose transporter member 2
(GLUT-2, Solute carrier family 2) and is predominantly expressed
in the liver. Mice deficient in GLUT-2 are hyperglycemic and
have elevated plasma levels of glucagon and free fatty acids [10].

Mutations in GLUT-2 cause the Fanconi-Bickel syndrome (FBS)
characterized by hypercholesterolemia
and hyperlipidemia
[11,12]. Cerf [13] argued that a high-fat diet causes a decreased
expression of the GLUT-2 glucose receptor on b-cell islets. As a
result, glucose stimulation of insulin exocytosis is impaired causing
hyperglycemia, a clinical hallmark of type 2 diabetes. In addition,
Kilpelainen et al. [14] found that physical activity moderates the
genetic effect of SLC2A2 on type 2 diabetes. These studies suggest
that these lifestyle factors could have masked genetic effects in
previous, unadjusted GWAS. This is emphasized by the strong
increase in statistical significance of the SLC2A2 polymorphisms
after adjusting for diet and physical activity, indicating that the
examined lifestyle factors modified the effect of this gene. Our
supplemental
show that physical activity markedly
moderated the genetic effect on total cholesterol.

The HP gene

the Haptoglobin-related Protein
Precursor (Hp), which binds hemoglobin (Hb) to form a stable
Hp-Hb complex and, thereby, prevents Hb-induced oxidative
tissue damage. Asleh et al. [15] identified severe impairment in the
ability of Hp to prevent oxidation caused by glycosylated Hb.
Diabetes is also associated with an increase in the non-enzymatic
glycosylation of serum proteins, so these authors suggested that
there is a specific interaction between diabetes, cardiovascular
disease and the Hp genotype. It results from the increased need of
rapidly clearing glycosylated Hb-Hp complexes from the suben-
dothelial
space before they oxidatively modify low-density
lipoprotein to form the atherogenic oxidized low-density lipopro-

and total serum cholesterol concentration decreased in the model

effect is moderated by diet and physical activity. Our supporting

particular.

the transfer of

We also observed a highly significant association between
rs1532624 in CETP and HDL-C levels. The CETP protein
catalyzes
insoluble cholesteryl esters among
lipoprotein particles. Variation in CETP is known to affect the
susceptibility to atherosclerosis and other cardiovascular diseases
[16]. Adjustment for diet and physical activity in our model caused
an increase of the p-value of this SNP. Our supporting results
indicate that the genetic effect is mediated by diet or by physical
activity in a similar way.

This study also has some limitations. First, we are aware that our
candidate gene association approach covers only a very small
fraction of all genomic loci, which is one of the potential reasons
why some classical lipid-influencing genes, such as APOE, are not
represented in our candidate SNP list. Therefore, our approach is
not comprehensive and may have failed to identify other relevant
lifestyle-sensitive genetic variants. Nonetheless, we decided to apply
this approach to make the best out of the available lifestyle data.
Second, our study provides only limited information on the role of
individual lifestyle factors for a genetic variant. However, in this
study we aimed at amplifying genetic effects by adjusting for a
maximum amount of environmental variance in a single model and,

therefore, we neglected some of these aspects here. Third, we did
not model genetic covariates in known lipid-relevant genes which
may also moderate the effect of other genetic predictors. This is due
to the focus of this paper on gene-environment relationships.

In summary, we have demonstrated that modeling environmen-
tal factors, in particular major food categories and physical activity,
can improve statistical power and lead to the discovery of novel
susceptibility loci. Such models also provide an understanding of the
complex interplay of genetic and environmental factors affecting
human quantitative traits. Inclusion of environmental covariates
represents a much needed next step in the quest to model the
complete environmental and genetic architecture of complex traits.

Participants

The examined subjects stem from five different population-
representative, pedigree-based cohorts from the EUROSPAN
consortium (http://www.eurospan.org). All
include a
comprehensive collection of data on family structure,
lifestyle,
blood samples for clinical chemistry, RNA and DNA analyses,
medical history, and current health status. All participants gave
their written informed consent [18]. A brief description of each
population is given below:

studies

The Northern Swedish Population Health Study (NSPHS) represents a
cross-sectional study conducted in the community of Karesuando
in the subartic region of the County of Norrbotten, Sweden, in
2006 [5]. This parish has about 1500 eligible inhabitants of whom
740 participated in the study. The final sample consisted of 309
men and 347 women who were aged between 14 and 91 years.
The inclusion of diet and activity covariates in the analytical model
and according missing values reduced the effective sample size by
less than 5%.

The Orkney Complex Disease Study (ORCADES) is a longitudinal
study in the isolated Scottish archipelago of Orkney [19].
Participants from a subgroup of ten islands (N = 719) were used
for the presented analysis. The sample comprised 334 men and
385 women aged between 18 and 100 years. The inclusion of diet

and activity covariates in the analytical model and according
missing values reduced the effective sample size by less than 5%.
The VIS study is a cross-sectional study in the villages of Vis
and Komiza on the Dalmatian island of Vis, Croatia, and was
conducted between 2003 and 2004 [20–22]. 795 participants who
had both genotype and phenotypic data available were analysed.
This cohort included 328 men and 467 women with an age
between 18 and 93 years.

The Microisolates in South Tyrol Study (MICROS)

is a cross-
sectional study carried out in the villages of Stelvio, Vallelunga,
and Martello, Venosta valley, South Tyrol, Italy, from 2001 to
2003 [23]. The 1,097 participants (475 males, 622 females, age
between 18 and 88 years) presented in this study are those for
whom both relevant genotype and phenotype data were available.
The Erasmus Rucphen Family Study (ERF) is a longitudinal study
on a population living in the Rucphen region, the Netherlands,
in the 19th century [24]. Fasting total cholesterol, HDL
cholesterol and triglyceride levels were available. LDL choles-
terol was estimated using the Friedewald formula [25]. The 918
individuals included in this study consisted of the first series of
participants with 354 men and 564 women aged between 18
and 92 years.

Genotyping

DNA samples were genotyped according to the manufacturer’s
instructions on Illumina Infinium HumanHap300v2 or Hu-
manCNV370v1 SNP bead microarrays. Both arrays have

Infinium assay and using the genotype cluster files provided by
Illumina. Individuals with a call rate below 95% and SNPs with a
call rate below 98%, deviating from Hard-Weinberg equilibrium

(pHWE,161026) or with a minor allele frequency of less than 1%
were excluded from the analysis.

assays using an ADVIA1650 clinical chemistry analyzer (Siemens

Institute for Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine,
Regensburg University Medical Center, Germany.

Diet

In the NSPHS cohort, we collected data with a food frequency
questionnaire based on the Northern Sweden 84-item Food
Frequency Questionnaire (NoS-84-FFQ) [26]. We included in the
questionnaire several items on foods specific for the lifestyle in this
geographic region, in particular on game consumption (reindeer,
moose). The answer options consisted of an 11-point format:
0 = ‘‘Never’’, 1 = ‘‘less than 1 time per month’’, 2 = ‘‘1 to 3 times
per month’’, 3 = ‘‘1 time per week’’, 4 = ‘‘2 to 4 times per week’’,
5 = ‘‘5 to 6 times per week’’, 6 = ‘‘1 time per day’’, 7 = ‘‘2 to 3
times per day’’, 8 = ‘‘4 to 5 times per day’’, 9 = ‘‘6 to 8 times per
day’’, 10 = ‘‘9 to 10 times per day’’. The questionnaire was applied
in electronic format by a trained study nurse as an interviewer. For
each food item we calculated daily intake in gram per day as a
standardized unit of measurement and aggregated the items to
food categories, such game meat, non-game meat, fish, and dairy
products. We evaluated the construct validity (known-groups
validity) of the added items on game consumption in the NoS-84-
FFQ questionnaire. We compared reindeer herders (N = 94) versus
non-reindeer herders (N = 505). We observed highly significant,
large effect sizes in men (ES = 1.25, p = 9.7610204) and women
(ES = 1.15, p = 2.9610205) in the expected direction correspond-
ing with an approximately three times higher consumption of
absolute overall game intake in reindeer herders compared to
others. A similar approach was used for the measurement and
analysis of dietary data collected with a food frequency
questionnaire in the Scottish cohort (Table S2).

Physical activity

In the NSPHS cohort, we used two self-report scales to measure
overall physical activity at work and at leisure. The Work Activity
Scale (WAS, 6 items) addresses typical occupational physical
activities: sitting, standing, walking, lifting, and general indicators
of physical activity, i. e. sweating and tiredness after work. The
Leisure Activity Scale (LAS, 4 items) asks for various typical
freetime activities such walking, cycling, other sporting activities,
and sweating as a general
indicator of physical activity.
Participants reported the frequency of each activity on a 5-point
rating scale (1 = ‘‘never’’, 2 = ‘‘seldom’’, 3 = ‘‘sometimes’’, 4 = ‘‘of-
ten’’, and 5 = ‘‘always’’). Both scales showed satisfying internal
consistency with Cronbach’s a(WAS) = 0.73 and Cronbach’s
a(LAS) = 0.70. A similar approach was used for the measurement
and analysis of data on physical activity collected with a self-report
questionnaire in the Scottish cohort (Table S2).

Statistical analysis

Model selection. Sex and age are chosen as

standard
moderators of medical outcomes. Food and physical activity
covariates have been selected based on findings on natural
variation in lifestyle factors in this (data not presented) and other
[7] northern Swedish populations between a modern, sedentary
and a traditional,
semi-nomadic lifestyle based on reindeer
herding. Mostly significant associations between diet and activity
covariates and lipid levels were found in the examined Swedish
EUROSPAN cohort in the following ranges: r = [20.01;0.12] (p =
[1.28610202;0.16]) for game meat, r = [20.13;20.05] (p = [8.636
10204;0.74])
(p = [2.126

(p = [5.05610209;1.30610206])
leisure
(Table S3). We finally selected sex, age, game meat, non-game
meat, fish, dairy products, physical activity at work, and physical
activity at leisure as covariates in our diet- and activity-adjusted
model (‘‘adjusted’’ model) in the Swedish EUROSPAN sample.
Sex and age were used as covariates in the ‘‘unadjusted’’ model.
We tested whether the inclusion of those covariates in the
explanatory model led to a statistical significant improvement of
the goodness of model fit compared to a restricted model by
applying a maximum likelihood ratio (MLR) test. We inferred a
significant better model fit of the full model if the difference of the
x2 value between both models had an equal or lower probability
than p = 0.05 (one-sided, upper tail) on a x2 distribution with k
degrees of freedom. The degrees of freedom k are equal to the
difference of the number of parameters in each model. The
difference of x2 values between both models
is calculated
according to the following formula with MLE indicating the
maximum likelihood estimates per model: x2(rest2full) = 22
(log10(MLErest)2log10(MLEfull)). The comparison of the goodness
of fit between the unadjusted and the diet- and activity-adjusted
full model, using a MLR test, showed a statistically significant
improvement for all four lipid traits (TC: x2

p = 5.21610211; LDL-C: x2

df = 6, p = 5.65610213). All

and lifestyle factors (with the effect of including only the polygenic,
sex, and age effects in parentheses) explained 64.07% (58.02%) of
the variation of TC, 59.47% (56.47%) of the variation of LDL-C,
83.73% (82.59%) of the variance of HDL-C and 58.68% (41.80%)
of the variation of TG levels. Dietary measures accounted for 22%
(TC), 40% (LDL-C), 74% (HDL-C), and 7% (TG), respectively, of
the variance explained by lifestyle factors with physical activity
being responsible for the rest. GWAS results for models adjusted
for sex, age, and diet only (Figures S1A, S1B, S1C, S1D) or
physical activity only (Figures S2A, S2B, S2C, S2D) are presented
in the supporting figures.

Genome-wide association analysis. First, deviations from
normality for all quantitative traits (lipids, age, diet, and physical
activity) were corrected by inverse-normal transformation without
adjusting for covariates. Second, linear mixed effects models were
fitted for the transformed outcomes (TC, LDL-C, HDL-C, TG)
using
in the Swedish
EUROSPAN sample and corresponding measures
in the
Scottish EUROSPAN sample (Table S2). The analysis was
performed using the ‘‘polygenic’’
linear mixed effects model
function polygenic() of the R/GenABEL package. Third, genome-
wide association analysis was performed using a score test, a
family-based association test [28], implemented in the mmscore()
function of R/GenABEL. It uses the residuals and the variance-
covariance matrix from the polygenic model and additional the

type I error of a = 0.05/311 388
was based on a local
SNPs = 1.661027 according to a Bonferroni adjustment.

Candidate gene association analysis. The same statistical
approach was used for association analysis of candidate loci with a
local type I error of a = 0.05. No Bonferroni adjustment was
applied to protect against a inflation since this method would be
biased for the following reasons. The applied selection procedure
for candidate loci makes the assumption of a global null hypothesis
highly unlikely. Additionally, the phenotypes and some of the
genotypes are highly correlated decreasing the number of
independent tests. Instead all confirmatory tests are reported to
allow the reader to evaluate the overall significance of the findings
[29].

Relatedness. l coefficients of lifestyle-adjusted genome-wide
analysis varied in a low range between 1.00 and 1.04 in the
Swedish cohort (see QQ-plots, Figures S3A, S3B, S3C, S3D, and
Figure S4A, S4B, S4C, S4D) and between 1.00 and 1.01 in the
Scottish cohort across all lipid traits. l values for the unadjusted
model used in the other three EUROSPAN cohorts did not exceed
1.01. These values indicate that our statistical model adequately
handled relatedness in our pedigree-based samples since deflation
of l values is expected after correction for family structure.
