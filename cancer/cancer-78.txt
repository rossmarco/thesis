Dietary and lifestyle  characteristics  were  evaluated  in relation to subsequent prostatic cancer risk  in a 
cohort of approximately 14,000 Seventh-day Adventist men who completed a detailed lifestyle questionnaire 
in 1976 and who were monitored  for cancer incidence until the end of  1982. During the 6-year  follow-up 
period,  180 histologically  confirmed  prostatic  cancers were detected  among some 78,000 man-years  of 
follow-up. Increasing educational attainment was associated with significantly decreased risk of prostate 
cancer in this study; age at first marriage was also inversely associated with  risk,  although this was not 
significant. There was no relationship between  body  mass index (as measured  by  Quetelet's  Index) and 
risk. A history of prostate '%rouble"  was associated with a 60% increase in risk which was highly significant. 
Although there were suggestive relationships between increasing animal product consumption and increased 
risk,  these results did  not persist after accounting  for the influence  of fruit and vegetable  consumption. 
Nor was exposure to the vegetarian  lifestyle  during the childhood  years  associated with  alterations  in 
subsequent risk.  However, increasing consumption  of beans,  lentils and peas, tomatoes,  raisin, dates, and 
other dried fruit were all associated with  significantly decreased prostate cancer risk.

ANCER OF THE PROSTATE is the second most Corn- 

ranking only  behind  lung cancer.  Among  men,  20% of 
all newly diagnosed cancers are prostatic cancer and they 
comprise  1 1 % of all male cancer deaths. Incidence rates 
have  been  increasing  during  the  last  several  decades.' 
Various  factors have been  investigated in  regard  to the 
etiology of  this  cancer  including  socioeconomic  status, 
sexual activity, marital status, venereal disease, and race. 
The incidence rates for blacks in the United States are the 
highest  recorded  in  the world.  Dietary  habits  have  also 
been related to this cancer by some investigators. 

Diets rich  in animal fat appear to be associated with 
increased risk for prostatic cancer. In ecologic studies there 
is a  strong positive correlation  between dietary  fat con- 
sumption  and  prostatic  cancer  incidence  worldwide.* 
Within the US prostatic cancer mortality rates are highest 
in counties with the highest fat consumption.'  Also, pros-

increases in fat consumption. The migrant studies of Jap- 
anese (and Polish)  in  the US  also support  some of the 
hypotheses  relating  dietary  practices  common  to  the 
western diet to the etiology of prostate cancer. 

Previous  studies among Seventh-day  Adventist  vege- 
tarians  have  found  lower  rates  for  prostate  cancer4 as 
compared to other white men in California. Fatal prostate 
cancer  risk  among Adventists  has been  associated with 
increasing milk consumption and over~eight.~ Hirayama 
has provided evidence that men who eat green and yellow 
vegetables on a daily basis have lower prostate cancer risk 
than those men who do not.6 However, three recent studies 
suggest that increased vitamin A intake may be associated 
with increased prostate cancer r i ~ k . ~ - ~  
Adventists consume 
nearly twice the daily average vitamin  A than other US 
whites. lo  Therefore, we  investigated the relationship  be- 
tween dietary and other lifestyle habits and prostate cancer 
risk  in  approximately  15,000 Adventist  men  who com- 
pleted a lifestyle questionnaire in  1976 and who were fol- 
lowed for cancer incidence through  1982. 

Methods 

The  study  design  has  been  described  in  detail  else- 
where."  Briefly,  in  1974  a  census  questionnaire  was 
mailed  to  all  Seventh-day  Adventist  households  in  the 
state  of California.  ~h~ 
identified approximately 
60,000 Adventists 25 years or older who were then mailed 
a  detailed  lifestyle questionnaire  in  1976. Among  non-

Hispanic whites, the response rate to the lifestyle ques- 
tionnaire was in excess of 75% whereas among other ethnic 
groups, the response rates were considerably lower. Hence, 
cancer  incidence  among  the  35,000  non-Hispanic 
white Adventists was  monitored  for a  total  of  6 years’ 
follow-up. 

A surveillance program  consisted of annual mailings 
to every member of the cohort, requesting information 
on any hospitalization in the previous  12-month period 
of follow-up. If a hospitalization was reported, the name 
and address of the appropriate hospital was recorded and 
permission to review the resulting medical record was ob- 
tained. Adventist  Health  Study personnel  reviewed  all 
medical records for evidence of a cancer diagnosis; per- 
tinent portions of the records were microfilmed to allow 
confirmation of the diagnosis by senior medical personnel. 
Follow-up in  this fashion was  complete for 99% of  the 
cohort. Computerized record linkage with those areas of 
the state of California with population-based tumor reg- 
istries was  also used to detect cases in these geographic 
areas (the Cancer Surveillance Program in Los Angeles 
County and the Resource for Cancer Epidemiology in the 
San Francisco Bay  area). This report is concerned with 
all newly diagnosed prostatic cancers (ICDO: 185) occur- 
ring in the cohort between the return of the lifestyle ques- 
tionnaire and the end of follow-up in December 1982. 

An  index of percent of total calories from animal fat 
was derived by comparing responses on the food frequency 
questions of the lifestyle questionnaire with the results of 
five 24-hour dietary recalls administered randomly over 
a period of 6 weeks to sample of study subjects. A mean 
weekly intake of nutrients was obtained in this way and 
provided the value for the dependent variable in a series 
of stepwise multiple regression analyses which regressed 
the food frequencies from the lifestyle questionnaire on 
the mean weekly nutrients. 

Statistical Analysis 

Members of the study population contributed person- 
years at risk beginning at the time they returned the life- 
style questionnaire and ending on December 3 I,  I982 or 
at the time of death or loss to follow-up. Distribution of 
exposure variables under  study were examined for the 
entire cohort in  order to  create categories of exposures 
which were biologically meaningful and which included 
adequate numbers of person-years at risk in each exposure 
category for analysis. Univariate analyses (age adjusted) 
were  conducted  to  obtain  relative risk  estimates using 
stratification  and  the  person-years  adaptation  of  the 
Mantel-Haenszel procedure for cohort studies. l 2   Where 
possible, three or more categories of  exposure were ex- 
amined in order to detect dose-response gradients between 
exposure and outcome. 

In order to evaluate the age-adjusted results in a mul- 
tivariate  setting,  Cox  proportional  hazards  regression 
models were constructed, including the primary exposure 
variable of interest and several covariates of interest. The 
proportionality requirement was evaluated graphically by 
inspecting the log-log  plots for all exposue variables un- 
der study. Interaction between the primary exposure vari- 
ables and covariates was assessed by  the change in log 
likelihood resulting from removal of all first order cross- 
product  terms simultaneously. This was  done to avoid 
the problem of multiple comparisons in the analysis. All 
multivariate-adjusted relative risks are accompanied by 
95% confidence intervals; all P’values are two-sided. 

Results 

Between 1976 and 1982, there were 180 incident cases 
of  prostate  cancer  (ICDO: 185) detected in  the  cohort 
among some 78,000 man-years of follow-up. 

The age-specific incidence of prostate cancer showed a 
steep elevation in the eighth decade of life. Mean age at 
diagnosis was approximately 74 years. Histologically, the 
large majority of the cancers were adenocarcinoma (89%) 
and more than 50% were still localized at diagnosis. Age- 
stratified analyses were performed first. Among lifestyle 
characteristics proposed  to  be  associated with  prostate 
cancer risk, higher educational attainment was associated 
with a significantly decreased prostate cancer risk (Table 
1). Risk among men with postgraduate education was less 
than  50% the risk  found among men  with  only a  high 
school education. Risk was also somewhat lower among 
unmarried men (including single, separated, divorced, and 
widowed) although this was not significant. Small num- 
bers precluded the analysis of separate subgroups of un- 
married men (e.g., single, widowed, divorced). Risk was 
also inversely associated with age at first marriage which 
was of borderline statistical significance (Trend P = 0.09). 
Cigarette smoking was not associated with a discernible 
trend in risk but any alcohol consumption was associated 
with a nonsignificant decrease in prostate cancer risk in 
these data. There was no relationship between Quetelet’s 
Index  and  prostate  cancer  risk.  A  history  of  prostate 
“trouble” or enlargement was associated with a significant 
increase in subsequent risk of prostate cancer. 

Since previous studies have noted a positive association 
between fat intake and prostate cancer risk, animal prod- 
uct  consumption  (which represents the  majority of  fat 
intake among Adventists) was evaluated, as before strat- 
ifying on age. Various types of beef (steak, hamburger, or 
veal) were not associated with prostate cancer risk in these 
data nor was  an overall index of  beef  intake (Table 2). 
There was, however, a suggestive relationship between re- 
ported consumption  of meat, poultry or fish as a com- 
posite variable and prostate cancer risk. Also increasing

Multivariate Results 

In order to evaluate the age-adjusted results in a mul- 
tivariate  setting,  Cox  Proportional  Hazards  Regression 
Models were  constructed which  included terms for  all 
variables which were statistically meaningful in the uni- 
variate analyses (Table 4). Such a model is useful as an 
attempt  to  control  confounding.  The  primary  dietary 
variable of interest was dummy coded to reflect the cat- 
egories of exposure which were evaluated in the univariate 
approach.

assessed by  removing all first order cross product terms 
from the model simultaneously and evaluating the change 
in the log-likelihood. No significant interactions were de- 
tected in this fashion. 

In this multivariate approach, increasing use of beans, 
lentils, and peas continued to be associated with a signif- 
icant reduction  in  prostate cancer  risk; also increasing 
tomato  consumption  conferred  significant  protection 
against prostate cancer, whereas increasing use of raisins, 
dates and other dried fruit was associated with decreases 
in risk  which were of  borderline significance. Fish  and 
other aaimal products did not show significant indepen- 
dent effects, though relatively strong trends were still ap- 
parent. 

Age at First Exposure to the Vegetarian Lifestyle 

We hypothesized the age at first exposure to a vegetarian 
lifestyle may be associated with subsequent cancer risk.

parental religion and the lifestyle practiced in the home 
before 15 years of age was developed. In Table 5 the results 
of this analysis are presented. We assume that if neither 
parent was  an Adventist, then  an omnivorous diet was 
available during the childhood years. Those men who had 
at least one Seventh-day Adventist parent and a vegetar- 
ian lifestyle in the home during the childhood and teenage 
years experienced a nonsignificant reduction in the relative 
risk of prostate cancer (RR = 0.76). Therefore, only weak 
evidence was found to support the hypothesis. 

Animal Fat Index 

Although the ability of the food frequency type of ques- 
tionnaire used in this study to derive nutrients was some- 
what limited, an index of percentage of total calories from 
animal fat was derived and showed a high degree of va- 
lidity. However, the relationship between quartiles of the 
animal fat index and prostate cancer risk was very weak 
(Table 6). In both the univariate and multivariate analyses, 
the  risk  of  prostate  cancer  among men  in  the  highest 
quartiles of  animal  fat  intake  was  approximately  35% 
higher than that among men in the lowest quartile of an- 
imal fat intake. None of the point estimates are signifi- 
cantly greater than one, nor is there convincing evidence 
of an increasing trend in risk with increasing consumption 
of animal fat in these data. 

Discussion 

In this cohort of Adventist men, prostate cancer risk 
was associated with several lifestyle and dietary variables, 
some of which have been reported in other populations 
and some of which have not. Age was strongly associated 
with risk in these data and also in other populations of 
US White males.I3 There is evidence that prostate cancer 
increases in  incidence with  age  more rapidly than  any 
other cancerI4 and that latent prostatic carcinoma displays 
a similar age gradient.I5 More than 50% of the prostate 
cancers in this population were still localized at the time 
of diagnosis; among US men approximately 65% are lo-

calized at the time of diagnosis.16 Given the high level of 
access to medical care common to the Adventist popu- 
lation, it is surprising that the proportion of prostate can- 
cers still localized at the time of diagnosis was not greater. 
Increasing educational attainment was associated with 
decreased prostate cancer risk which was highly significant. 
Educational attainment  is highly correlated with  socio- 
economic status in this and other populations. However, 
previous studies have not shown prostate cancer risk to 
be associated with socioeconomic status in a consistent 
fashion."  This may be due to lack of a consistent measure 
of social class in various studies.I8 Occupation, education, 
residence, and other measures of social standing have all 
been evaluated in relation to prostate cancer risk. Several 
early studies in Britain'9*20 demonstrated higher prostate 
cancer  mortality  in  the  higher  socioeconomic groups. 
Also, studies in the US21-23 and in Scotland24 showed sim- 
ilar relationships. Other US  studies have  noted  slightly 
higher prostate cancer mortality  in the lower socioeco- 
a  finding  consistent  with  ours, 
nomic  g r o ~ p i n g s , ~ ' , ~ ~  
whereas Ernster et  al. noted higher prostate cancer mor- 
tality in  younger men  of  lower  social class, but  higher 
prostate cancer mortality in  older men  of  higher social 
class.27 However, prostatic cancer incidence was  higher 
in the lower social class at all age groups in that study, 
again a  finding consonant  with the incidence data pre- 
sented here. It is possible that the protective relationship 
associated with  higher educational attainment noted in 
this study is secondary to delay in age at mamage or the 
onset of sexual activity. 

In this study married men experienced slightly higher 
risk of prostate cancer than unmarried men although the 
difference was not significant. Small numbers precluded 
the analysis of specific subgroups of unmarried men. Also, 
there was a suggestive, inverse relationship between age 
at first marriage and prostate cancer risk. This may be 
consistent with previous studies which indicate that early 
age at first sexual intercourse, number of sexual partners, 
and other measures of sexual activity may be positively 
associated with  risk  of  prostate cancer. Prostate cancer 
mortality  rates  for both  whites  and  non-whites in  the 
United  States are  higher  for  married  men  than  single 
men28 and incidence rates for cancer of the prostate are 
higher in ever married men than unmarried men in Den- 
mark.29 Newel1 et  al. recently  noted  no  excess risk  for 
prostate cancer among  widower^,^' a finding in agreement 
with an earlier 

There  was  no  relationship between body  weight  ad- 
justed for height (Quetelet's Index) and risk  of prostatic 
cancer in those data, a finding which is in agreement with 
some previous s t ~ d i e s ~ , ~ ' . ~ ~  
but  not  with   other^^^,^^  in- 
cluding an earlier study of fatal prostate cancer risk  in 
Adventists.'  These discrepant results are difficult to ex- 
plain although various measures of weight corrected for 
height have been employed in various studies. The earlier 

study  of  prostatic cancer  mortality  in  Adventists  used 
percent desirable weight with Metropolitan Life Insurance 
Company data as the standard.35 We also evaluated per- 
cent desirable weight and observed no relationship to risk 
(data not shown). When Quetelet's Index was used as the 
measure of body mass, no relationship was evident, either. 
Although there were no data to evaluate diagnosed (z.e., 
histologically or  clinically  confirmed) benign  prostatic 
hypertrophy (BPH) in regard to subsequent prostate can- 
cer risk in this study, affirmative response to the question, 
"Has a doctor ever told you that you had prostate trouble 
(enlarged prostate)?'  resulted in a relative risk of prostate 
cancer of approximately 1.6 which was highly significant. 
Two previous studies have shown a positive relationship 
between BPH and prostatic c a n ~ e r , ~ ~ . ~ ~  
although another 
retrospective cohort study did not.38 However, with the 
data available in this study, it is impossible to determine 
if the prostate trouble was truly BPH or incipient prostate 
cancer. 

The relationship between dietary practices and prostate 
cancer risk has been evaluated by  various types of study 
designs including ecologic analyses, migrant studies, co- 
hort studies, and retrospective case-control studies. Most 
of these studies have been reviewed r e ~ e n t l y . ' ~ . ~ ~  
In gen- 
eral, prostate cancer risk appears to be enhanced by  in- 
creasing consumption of dietary fat and/or high fat animal 
products such as meat, milk, cheese, and eggs, although 
the  findings in  this  regard  are  not  entirely consistent. 
Conversely, there  is  some  evidence that  frequent con- 
sumption of dark green and yellow vegetables may exert 
a protective influence on prostate cancer r i ~ k , ~ , ~ '  
although 
three recent case-control studies suggest an enhancement 
of risk with high dietary vitamin A intake.7-9 The ques- 
tionnaire employed in this study was not sufficiently de- 
tailed to allow the accurate derivation of an index of vi- 
tamin  A.  However, several  foods with  high  vitamin A 
and/or  C ,  such as green  salads, fresh citrus fruits, and 
tomatoes, were evaluated. 

The results of this analysis of the dietary habits indicate 
that increased consumption of various types of fruits and 
vegetables are strongly protective. Consumption of high 
fat animal  products are not significantly related to risk, 
although a trend compatible with increased risk remains 
even after multivariate adjustment. However, in the mul- 
tivariate analysis in which the animal products and fruits 
and vegetables were  each simultaneously controlled for 
the other, the protective relationships associated with fruit 
and vegetable use persisted. This observation may be con- 
sistent with the hypothesis that exposure to anticarcino- 
gens in the diet may be the critical element in the initiation 
of the malignant process rather than the presence of car- 
cinogen~.~' 

We did not observe any enhancement of risk attendent 
to increasing consumption of foods containing vitamins 
A or C or beta-carotene as noted by previous  worker^.^-^

Indeed,  consumption  of  those  foods  containing  large 
quantities of those nutrients were consistently associated 
with decreased risk in this population. The protective re- 
lationships  appeared,  perhaps,  strongest  in  those  men 
older than  70 years.  The enhanced  risk  associated with 
high vitamin A intake noted by others’s8 was strongest in 
men older than 70 years. 

There were no striking alterations in prostatic cancer 
risk in regard to use of cigarettes or alcohol, although this 
population  is not ideally suited for evaluating those ex- 
posures since both practices are proscribed by the church. 
However, since a large proportion of Adventists are adult 
converts to the church, past smoking habits were evalu- 
ated. In this study, past smoking was associated with  a 
nonsignificant increase in  risk  (RR = 1.24) which is in 
agreement with some previous 

but not 

In summary, this prospective cohort study of various 
lifestyle and dietary habits among Adventist men  dem- 
onstrated strong protective relationships with increasing 
educational attainment, which may have been secondary 
to sexual practices, the history of which was not available 
from the study questionnaire. Also, strong protective re- 
lationships were seen to be afforded by the increased con- 
sumption of various fruits and vegetables, in particular, 
beans, lentils, peas, tomatoes, and dried fruit. These find- 
ings  should  be  considered  in  future  efforts  involving 
chemoprevention of prostate cancer in man.
