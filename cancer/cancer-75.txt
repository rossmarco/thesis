Abstract

Fruits and vegetables have been examined for their possible effects on the risk of bladder cancer, as they contain

numerous nutrients, phytochemicals, and antioxidants with potentially anticarcinogenic properties. In a prospective ana-

lysis of 185,885 older adults participating in the Multiethnic Cohort Study, we examined whether the consumption of fruits

and vegetables, or of nutrients concentrated in fruits and vegetables, was associated with bladder cancer risk. Cox

proportional hazards models were used to calculate HRs and 95% CIs for bladder cancer in relation to dietary intakes. A

total of 581 invasive bladder cancer cases (429 men and 152 women) were diagnosed over a mean follow-up period of

12.5 y. In women, total fruits and vegetables [HR = 0.35 (95% CI: 0.22, 0.56); highest vs. lowest quartile], total vegetables

[HR = 0.49 (95% CI: 0.29, 0.83)], yellow-orange vegetables [HR = 0.48 (95% CI: 0.30, 0.77)], total fruits [HR = 0.54 (95%

CI: 0.34, 0.85)], and citrus fruits [HR = 0.56 (95% CI: 0.34, 0.90)] were inversely associated with the risk of invasive bladder

cancer in risk factor-adjusted models. In addition, women with the highest intakes of vitamins A, C, and E; the carotenoids
a-carotene, b-carotene, and b-cryptoxanthin; and folate had a lower risk of bladder cancer. For men, no associations for

fruits, vegetables, or nutrients were found overall, although inverse associations were observed for vegetable intake

among current smokers, and in ethnic-speciﬁc analyses, for fruit and vegetable intake among Latinos speciﬁcally. Our

ﬁndings suggest that greater consumption of fruits and vegetables may lower the risk of invasive bladder cancer among

women and highlight the need for speciﬁc subgroup analyses in future studies. J. Nutr. 143: 1283–1292, 2013.

Introduction

Bladder cancer is the sixth most commonly diagnosed cancer
in the United States, with an estimated 73,510 new cases and
14,880 deaths occurring annually (1). Tobacco smoking is the
most established risk factor for bladder cancer (2), with ;50%
of newly diagnosed cases estimated to be attributable to the
effects of smoking (3). Although occupational exposures and, in
areas with endemic rates of infection, schistosomiasis have been
consistently associated with bladder cancer risk (4,5), the evi-
dence with respect to other environmental exposures in the eti-
ology of this disease is less consistent.

Dietary factors have been examined in several previous epi-
demiological studies (6,7), because they provide an abundant
source of nutrients and phytochemicals with potentially anti-
carcinogenic properties. However, in a recent consensus report,

the World Cancer Research Fund (WCRF)8/American Institute
of Cancer Research (AICR) concluded that the evidence was
limited with respect to a role of fruits and vegetables in the
development of bladder cancer (8). Since the 2007 WCRF/AICR
report, several case-control studies have reported inverse asso-
ciations for fruits and/or vegetables with the risk of bladder
cancer (9–13); however, RRs have generally failed to depart
from unity in prospective cohort studies (14,15).

Because previous prospective studies have been conducted pri-
marily in ethnically homogeneous populations of European
ancestry, the Multiethnic Cohort (MEC) Study provides an op-
portunity to expand research on the diet-bladder cancer relation-
ship. Therefore, the aim of our study was to examine prospectively
whether greater consumption of fruits and vegetables, or of
nutrients concentrated in fruits and vegetables, was associated
with the risk of bladder cancer in a population of older adults
from diverse ethnic backgrounds.

Participants and Methods

Study population. The MEC Study is a longitudinal study designed to
investigate the associations of dietary, lifestyle, and genetic factors with
the incidence of cancer and was previously described in detail (16).
Brieﬂy, the cohort was established from 1993 to 1996 by mailing a self-
administered, 26-page questionnaire to men and women aged 45–75 y
who were residing in Hawaii and California. More than 215,000 adults
comprised of 5 main ethnic groups (African Americans, Japanese Americans,
Latinos, Native Hawaiians, and whites) voluntarily completed the base-
line questionnaire indicating their consent to participate in the study. The
study protocol was approved by the institutional review boards of the
University of Hawaii and the University of Southern California. For
the present study, data were available for 185,885 participants after
excluding those who: 1) were not in 1 of the 5 main ethnic groups
recruited into the study (n = 13,989); 2) reported implausible dietary
values based on total energy intake or its components (n = 8263) (17); 3)
were identiﬁed through either the questionnaire or tumor registry linkage
to have had a diagnosis of cancer of the bladder prior to cohort entry (n =
292); or 4) had missing data on any of the following key covariates:
smoking status, duration and intensity of cigarette smoking, or occupa-
tional history (n = 7353).

Cohort follow-up and case identiﬁcation. Follow-up began on the
date of questionnaire completion and accrued until a diagnosis of blad-
der cancer, death, or the last follow-up date for this analysis (December
31, 2007). Routine linkages to the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End

Results cancer registries for California and Hawaii were conducted to
identify incident cases diagnosed over the follow-up period. Routine
linkages to the California and Hawaii death certiﬁcate ﬁles as well as to
the National Death Index were conducted to identify deaths during the
follow-up period. For the entire cohort, the average out-migration rate
for members was only 3.7% after 7 y and 7.6% after 15 y of follow-up,
with California as the primary relocation destination for Hawaiian par-
ticipants. Thus, case ascertainment is thought to be close to complete.
The primary outcome for this analysis, invasive bladder cancer, was
classiﬁed using the International Classiﬁcation of Diseases for Oncology,
Third Edition codes C67.0-C67.9 and was restricted to invasive malig-
nancies. A total of 581 incident invasive bladder cancer cases were
diagnosed over a mean follow-up period of 12.5 y. In a secondary out-
come analysis, we expanded the case status to include incident in situ
cases (n = 1137 total; n = 556 in situ).

Dietary assessment. Dietary intake was measured at baseline by using
a quantitative FFQ (QFFQ) that assessed the frequency and quantity of
food items consumed during the preceding year (16). Grams of food
consumed were calculated from single food items and mixed dishes.
Mixed dishes were ﬁrst disaggregated to the ingredient level using a
customized recipe database. Nutrient intakes were computed using the
food composition tables developed and maintained by the University of
Hawaii Cancer Center. Foods and food groups included in this analysis
were: total fruits and vegetables, total vegetables, light green vegetables,
dark green vegetables, yellow-orange vegetables, cruciferous vegetables,
total fruits, fruit juice, citrus fruits, and yellow-orange fruits. Nutrients

included in this analysis were those known to be concentrated in fruits
and vegetables. Two dietary patterns previously identiﬁed by exploratory
factor analysis and validated by conﬁrmatory factor analysis in the entire
MEC Study population (17) were included in this study. The ‘‘vegeta-
bles’’ dietary pattern was characterized by high loadings on vegetable
groups and the ‘‘fruit and milk’’ dietary pattern was characterized by
high loadings on milk/yogurt and fruit groups. In a calibration study
(18), using energy-adjusted intakes [g/(1000 kcal  d)] measured from
the QFFQ and multiple 24-h recalls, Pearson correlation coefﬁcients
were 0.43 and 0.36 for vegetables and 0.60 and 0.60 for fruits among
men and women, respectively.

Statistical analysis. Cox proportional hazards models with age as the
time metric were used to calculate HRs and 95% CIs for invasive bladder
cancer. Foods and nutrients were examined as energy densities (per 1000
kcal) in all models, as correlations between dietary estimates from the
QFFQ and 24-h recalls were found to improve after energy adjustment in
the calibration study mentioned above (18). Dietary exposures were
modeled as quartiles and based on the exposure distribution of all cohort
members. The lowest intake group served as the referent in all models.
Linear trends were tested by entering sex- and ethnic-speciﬁc medians
within the appropriate quartile as continuous variables into the models.
Estimates are presented separately for men and women, as results were
found to differ by sex. Basic models were adjusted for age at cohort entry,
ethnicity, and total energy (log-transformed kcal/d) in the log-linear model
component. Multivariable models were further adjusted for family his-
tory of bladder cancer (yes/no), occupation in a high-risk industry (yes/
no; employed $10 y in rubber or tire manufacturing, plastic production
or processing, or pesticide production), and cigarette smoking using a
comprehensive base model developed for the study of lung cancer in the
MEC Study (19). The smoking model included smoking status; average
number of cigarettes smoked per day; average number of cigarettes smoked
per day squared; number of years smoked (time-dependent); number of
years since quitting (time-dependent); and interactions of ethnicity with
smoking status, average number of cigarettes, and average number of cig-
arettes squared. Covariates were selected a priori based on their associa-
tion with bladder cancer risk (20). The assumption of proportional hazards
was found to be satisﬁed in all models by examining the relationship of

1286 Park et al.

scaled Schoenfeld residuals with time. We also examined a possible non-
linear relation between fruit and vegetable consumption and bladder
cancer risk with restricted cubic splines (21).

We ran the models stratiﬁed by smoking status and ethnicity. Tests for
interactions were based on the Wald test of the cross-product terms of the
dietary variables and the subgroup membership indicators. Lag analyses
excluding participants diagnosed with bladder cancer within 2 y of
questionnaire completion (n = 75) and sensitivity analyses restricting the
cases to those with transitional cell carcinomas (n = 533) were also
conducted. Associations with risk were also examined for calibration-
corrected nutrient density values. All statistical tests were 2-sided and
P <0.05 was considered signiﬁcant. All data analyses were performed
using SAS 9.2 statistical software (SAS Institute).

Results

Baseline characteristics of the study population are presented in
Table 1. For both men and women, participants with incident
bladder cancer were older than same-sex cohort members. Com-
pared with all MEC Study participants, the proportions of white
men and African American women, current/former smokers,
and the mean values for pack-years of cigarette smoking and
alcohol consumption were higher among the incident cases.
Fruit and vegetable intakes were lower in bladder cancer cases,
particularly for women.

The HRs for bladder cancer according to quartiles of fruit
and vegetable intakes are provided in Table 2. A dietary pattern
characterized by the high consumption of vegetables was asso-
ciated with a decreased risk of bladder cancer among women in
both basic and risk factor-adjusted [highest vs. lowest quartile,
HR = 0.40 (95% CI: 0.23, 0.69); P-trend = 0.004] models. In
women, a dietary pattern characterized by the high intakes of
fruit and milk was inversely associated with bladder cancer risk
in the basic model [HR = 0.57 (95% CI: 0.34, 0.94); P-trend =
0.03]; however, the risk estimates were attenuated and not

signiﬁcant in the risk factor-adjusted model [HR = 0.75 (95%
CI: 0.45, 1.25); P-trend = 0.30]. Similarly, among women, higher
intakes of total fruits and vegetables [HR = 0.35 (95% CI: 0.22,
0.56); P-trend < 0.001], total vegetables, yellow-orange vegeta-
bles, total fruits, and citrus fruits were inversely associated with
the risk of bladder cancer in risk factor-adjusted models. For men,
a signiﬁcant inverse association was found for the ‘‘vegetables’’
dietary pattern, fruits and vegetables, all vegetable subgroups,
and total fruits in the basic models. However, the associations
did not depart from unity in the risk factor-adjusted models,
with the attenuation in risk largely attributable to adjustment for
smoking variables. Restricted cubic spline analyses adjusted for
covariates also showed a linear reduction in risk with higher
intake of fruits and vegetables among women but no signiﬁcant
association among men (data not shown).

The HRs for bladder cancer according to quartiles of selected
nutrients and carotenoids concentrated in fruits and vegetables
are presented in Table 3. For women, higher intakes of vitamins
A, C, and E; the carotenoids a-carotene, b-carotene, and
b-cryptoxanthin; and folate were associated with a reduced
risk of bladder cancer in risk factor-adjusted models. For men,
no signiﬁcant associations were observed in risk factor-adjusted
models for any nutrient or phytochemical examined. Similar
results for food groups and nutrients were obtained when ex-
cluding cases diagnosed within the ﬁrst 2 y of follow-up or when
restricting case status to include only transitional cell carcino-
mas (data not shown). Also, in secondary outcome analyses that
included in situ cases, the results were generally similar to those
presented in Tables 2 and 3, although modestly attenuated. For
example, the HRs for fruit and vegetable consumption were 1.03
(95% CI: 0.84, 1.27; P-trend = 0.61) for men and 0.51 (95% CI:
0.36, 0.73; P-trend < 0.001) for women (P-interaction between
sexes < 0.001) (data not shown). When examining noninvasive
cases only, no signiﬁcant association was found in either men or
women; for fruit and vegetable intake, HR = 1.24 (95% CI:
0.93, 1.64; P-trend = 0.11) in men and HR = 0.91 (95% CI:
0.51, 1.61; P-trend = 0.72) in women, and the P-interaction
between sexes = 0.37 (data not shown). In addition, for the
nutrients examined, the risk estimates for bladder cancer were
similar when modeling calibration-corrected nutrient densities
(data not shown).

We examined these relationships in selected subgroups among
men to see whether some of the strong inverse associations in
women might become apparent in men also. In analyses stra-
tiﬁed by smoking status at baseline (Table 4), we did ﬁnd sig-
niﬁcant inverse trends for a dietary pattern characterized by the
high consumption of vegetables and for total vegetable intake, but

only among current male smokers [HR = 0.40 (95% CI: 0.18,
0.90); P-trend = 0.02, P-interaction across smoking status =
0.04; and HR = 0.43 (95% CI: 0.18, 1.02); P-trend = 0.03,
P-interaction = 0.08, respectively]. In ethnic-speciﬁc analyses
among men (Table 5) conducted for the 3 largest ethnicities in
the study (Japanese Americans, Latinos, and whites), there was
considerable heterogeneity among the groups. The only signif-
icant ﬁndings were in the Latinos, among whom a lower risk of
bladder cancer was seen for the highest level of consumption of
fruits and vegetables [HR = 0.36 (95% CI: 0.17, 0.76); P-trend =
0.006, P-interaction between Latinos and the other 2 groups =
0.006] and of total fruits [HR = 0.40 (95% CI: 0.19, 0.84);
P-trend = 0.02, P-interaction = 0.002]. Inverse associations
conﬁned to Latino men were also found for lycopene, vitamin C,
and folate (P-interaction < 0.05, data not shown). Subgroup
analyses among women indicated that the associations did not
vary across smoking status and between the 2 ethnic groups with
more cases [African Americans (n = 55) and whites (n = 35)],
although the number of cases in all subgroups of women was
limited (data not shown). We also examined the associations
separately for Hawaii and California, because differences in
unmeasured environmental exposures (e.g., drinking water and
air pollution) between the 2 study areas might modify the diet-
bladder cancer relationship; however, there was no indication
that the associations varied for any dietary exposure examined
between the 2 study areas (data not shown).

Discussion

In this large, multiethnic cohort of older adults, we found a
lower risk of bladder cancer among women with a dietary pat-
tern characterized by the high intake of vegetables as well as
for those consuming the greatest amounts of total fruits and
vegetables, total vegetables, yellow-orange vegetables, total fruits,
and citrus fruits. Among women, higher intakes of several nu-
trients and carotenoids concentrated in fruits and vegetables,
including vitamins A, C, and E; the carotenoids a-carotene,
b-carotene, and b-cryptoxanthin; and folate, were also associ-
ated with a lower risk of bladder cancer. Among men, the inverse
associations in basic models were attenuated upon adjustment
for smoking variables. In subgroup analyses based on a limited
number of cases, vegetable intake remained inversely associated
with bladder cancer risk only among current smokers at base-
line. In ethnic-speciﬁc analyses among men, Latinos with the
greatest consumption of fruits and vegetables, fruits, and citrus
fruits were at lower risk for bladder cancer.

A systematic literature review conducted by the WCRF/AICR
in 2007 did not ﬁnd strong evidence in support of fruits and
vegetables in the development of bladder cancer. More recent
studies have generally reported ﬁndings consistent with the
WCRF/AICR summary conclusion. Two recent prospective co-
hort studies reported no association for fruits and vegetables
(14,15), whereas an additional study suggested a protective ef-
fect for b-carotene from foods but not from supplements (22).
Case-control studies have consistently reported inverse associ-
ations for fruits, vegetables, or related micronutrients with blad-
der cancer risk (9–13,23); however, these studies are limited due
to the potential for differential recall between cases and controls
to have affected the ﬁndings. Contrary to our ﬁndings in women,
one prior case-control study examined dietary patterns in rela-
tion to bladder cancer risk and reported no association for a
prudent dietary pattern characterized by the high consumption
of fruits and vegetables (24); however, this analysis was con-
ducted in an Uruguayan population comprised primarily of men
(;88%). Most previous studies have included noninvasive as
well as invasive bladder cancer as end points. In the current
study, we found no association for noninvasive tumors in either

men or women. Thus, should dietary factors operate to inﬂuence
the progression of bladder cancer from in situ to malignant
disease, the inclusion of noninvasive tumors may weaken the
association between diet and bladder cancer risk. Further inves-
tigation is needed to conﬁrm our ﬁndings that are restricted to
invasive bladder cancer.

The present study found an inverse association between fruits,
vegetables, and bladder cancer risk that was largely conﬁned to
women. The reason for the heterogeneity between sexes is not
clear, although it may in part reﬂect the higher intake of fruits
and vegetables among women. However, we found no associ-
ation in the risk of bladder cancer among men with the highest
fruit and vegetable intakes when examined as quartiles of ex-
posure or as continuous variables using restricted cubic splines
in regression. Interestingly, although the number of cases in
women (n = 152) was smaller than in men (n = 429), the esti-
mated risk reduction in women was large enough to reach sig-
niﬁcance. Also, the signiﬁcant inverse associations for women
remained in the lag analyses that excluded incident cases di-
agnosed within 2 y of completing the baseline questionnaire and
in several sensitivity analyses that included in situ cases, restricted

average number of cigarettes, squared average number of cigarettes, number of years smoked (time dependent), and number of years since quitting (time dependent).

case status to transitional cell carcinomas, and examined associ-
ations using calibration-corrected nutrient densities. The sex
differences in the HRs for incident bladder cancer in the MEC
Study contrast with the associations reported in 2 other cohorts,
namely, the Health Professionals Follow-up and NursesÕ Health
Studies: whereas beneﬁcial effects of high cruciferous vegetable
consumption were suggested for the men in the Health Profes-
sionals Follow-up (25), no associations were seen for the women
in NursesÕ Health Studies (26). Other prospective studies have
reported no sex differences in the associations between fruits or
vegetables and bladder cancer risk and, accordingly, combined
men and women in the analysis (14,15,27). Parity and early
menopause may be related to the incidence of bladder cancer
among women, although whether effects are due to female hor-
mones remains uncertain (28). In the current study, however,
female reproductive factors were not related to bladder cancer
risk and did not change the associations between fruits or vege-
tables and bladder cancer risk when included in the models.

In men, the beneﬁcial effect of high vegetable intake was
conﬁned to current smokers in the risk factor-adjusted models. It
is plausible that smokers may beneﬁt the most from the greater
consumption of fruits and vegetables high in antioxidants, as

1290 Park et al.

they have been shown to have lower antioxidant levels than
nonsmokers (29). In addition, fruits and vegetables contain a
wide range of bioactive constituents that may operate in the
development or progression of bladder cancer, including counter-
acting nitrosation and inﬂuencing bioactive transformations. A
cohort study in The Netherlands also found that the inverse
association between fruit consumption and bladder cancer was
more pronounced in smokers than in those who never smoked
(27). However, in a Finnish cohort of male smokers, no associ-
ation of fruits and vegetables with bladder cancer risk was
observed (30). Two other cohort studies have suggested that an
inverse association between fruit and/or vegetable intake and the
risk of bladder cancer was stronger in (25) or limited to those
who never smoked (14), but no signiﬁcant interaction with smok-
ing status was found in either study. In ethnic-speciﬁc analyses,
we found that Latino men consuming high amounts of fruit had
a lower risk of bladder cancer compared with Japanese American
and white men. The mean intake of fruit was slightly higher for
Latinos than other ethnic groups and the proportion of current
smokers was slightly, but signiﬁcantly, higher in Latinos (18.3%)
than in Japanese Americans (14.9%) and whites (16.2%), pos-
sibly contributing to the discrepant ﬁndings. However, we were

not able to examine whether the inverse association of fruits
with bladder cancer risk in Latino men was independent from
smoking status due to the limited number of cases.

The current study has several strengths, including the pro-
spective design that allowed for prediagnostic dietary assess-
ment, the ethnic diversity of the study sample, the administration
of a validated FFQ with a detailed nutritional database, and the
population-based sampling frame utilized by the MEC Study
allowing for the generalizability of the study results. There were
also potential limitations. Dietary intake was likely measured
with error in our study. To minimize errors in dietary assessment
associated with the use of a FFQ, we used a detailed and vali-
dated instrument that included a comprehensive list of food
items. We also examined food and nutrient densities in relation
to disease risk, potentially reducing measurement error, because
nutrient densities, when compared with absolute values, were
more highly correlated with multiple 24-h recalls in our prior
calibration study (18). In addition, we examined associations for
calibration-adjusted nutrients intakes. Also, a single FFQ may
not well represent long-term dietary intake and cannot capture
possible changes in diet or other health behaviors occurring dur-
ing the follow-up period. In future analyses, we will be able to
study the impact of repeated dietary measurements and changes
in dietary intake and smoking status in relation to bladder cancer
risk. Due to the smaller number of bladder cancers diagnosed in
women during the follow-up period for this analysis, the sta-
tistical power for sex-speciﬁc associations for bladder cancer by
smoking status or ethnicity was too limited. With additional
follow-up time and the accrual of more cases, we will be able to
better examine associations for speciﬁc subgroups of women. In
addition, we cannot rule out the possibility that subgroup ﬁnd-
ings in men may reﬂect chance ﬁndings due to the small number
of cases. Although measured and unmeasured confounding fac-
tors may have inﬂuenced associations of fruits and vegetables
with bladder cancer risk, we were able to examine and control
for a wide range of potential confounders. In particular, we rig-
orously adjusted for cigarette smoking using a comprehensive
model developed for a previous lung cancer study, which ac-
counted for changes in smoking status over time using time-
dependent variables (19).

In conclusion, our ﬁndings suggest that higher consumption
of fruits and vegetables may lower the risk of invasive bladder
cancer among women. Although no overall association was found
for men, subgroup analyses suggest that the association between
fruits or vegetables and bladder cancer risk varies by smoking
status and ethnicity. Further follow-up is required to conﬁrm
these ﬁndings with a greater number of cases and to examine
associations with risk for speciﬁc subgroups of women.
