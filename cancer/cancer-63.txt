Abstract

Background: One-carbon metabolism—important for DNA stability and integrity—may play a role in breast carcinogen-

esis. However, epidemiologic studies addressing this issue have yielded inconsistent results.

Objective: We prospectively investigated associations between breast cancer and plasma folate, riboﬂavin, vitamin B-6,

vitamin B-12, and homocysteine in women recruited to the Varese (Italy) cohort of the EPIC (European Prospective

Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition) study.

Methods: We performed a nested case-control study on women aged 35–65 y at recruitment with a median body mass index
of 25.3 kg/m2 who gave blood samples in 1987–1992 and again in 1993–1998. Breast cancer cases identiﬁed by 31 December

2009 were individually matched to controls. RRs of breast cancer (and subtypes deﬁned by hormone receptor status) with 95%

CIs were estimated by unconditional logistic regression, controlling for matching factors and breast cancer risk factors.

Results: After a median of 14.9 y, 276 breast cancer cases were identiﬁed and matched to 276 controls. Increasing plasma

vitamin B-6 was associated with decreased risk of overall (RR: 0.78; 95% CI: 0.63, 0.96 for 1-SD increase), premenopausal

(RR: 0.66; 95% CI: 0.48, 0.92 for 1-SD increase), estrogen receptor-positive (RR: 0.79; 95% CI: 0.63, 1.00 for 1-SD

increase), and progesterone receptor-positive (RR: 0.72; 95% CI: 0.55, 0.95 for 1-SD increase) breast cancers. Increased
plasma vitamin B-6 was also associated with decreased breast cancer risk in alcohol consumers ($7 g/d) compared with

consumption of <7 g/d or nonconsumption (RR: 0.71; 95% CI: 0.51, 0.99). High plasma riboﬂavin was associated with

signiﬁcantly lower risk in premenopausal women (RR: 0.45; 95% CI: 0.21, 0.94; highest compared with the lowest
quartile, P trend = 0.021). Plasma homocysteine, folate, and vitamin B-12 were not associated with breast cancer risk.

Conclusions: High plasma vitamin B-6 and riboﬂavin may lower breast cancer risk, especially in premenopausal women.
Additional research is necessary to further explore these associations. J Nutr 2016;146:1227–34.

and thus play important roles in maintaining DNA stability and
integrity. Folate, as 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, is required to
remethylate homocysteine to methionine, which is converted
to S-adenosylmethionine. The latter provides methyl groups for
methylation reactions in general, and DNA and RNA biosyn-
thesis in particular (1–5). S-Adenosylmethionine depletion
induces DNA hypomethylation, which may lead to expression of
proto-oncogenes and eventually cancer (6). Folate deﬁciency
also results in deﬁcient methylation of uracil to thymine, so that
uracil is incorporated into DNA (2), leading to chromosome
breaks and carcinogenesis (3, 6). Vitamin B-12 deﬁciency is

expected to cause chromosome breaks by the same mechanism
as folate because it is an essential coenzyme in the methylation of
homocysteine to methionine (2, 4).

Vitamin B-6 is an essential coenzyme for several catabolic
and anabolic reactions. In particular it is required for the
conversion of tetrahydrofolate to 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofo-
late by serine hydroxymethyltransferase (2). 5,10-Methylenete-
trahydrofolate is required for the synthesis of nucleotides, which
are themselves necessary for DNA synthesis and repair. Vitamin
B-6 deﬁciency decreases the activity of serine hydroxymethyl-
transferase, thereby depleting the 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofo-
late pool, so that uracil
is incorporated into DNA, and
chromosome breaks occur (2). Vitamin B-6 is also necessary
for the synthesis of glutathione from homocysteine: glutathione
is a cofactor of glutathione S-transferases and peroxidases,
which detoxify many carcinogenic compounds and protect
against oxidative DNA damage (7–9). Riboﬂavin is the precur-
sor of ﬂavin adenine dinucleotide, a necessary cofactor for 5,10-
methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (10–13), which catalyzes
the irreversible conversion of 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate to
5-methyltetrahydrofolate, with the latter being the methyl donor
for DNA methylation (10, 11, 14, 15).

Inadequate levels of folate, vitamin B-12, vitamin B-6, and
riboﬂavin may all result in high levels of blood homocysteine (5,
16) by disrupting the pathways summarized above (17). In vitro
studies indicate that high homocysteine levels are associated
with high proliferation rates of cancer cells including breast
cancer cells (18, 19) and also with oxidative damage to cells
(20). High homocysteine levels in blood have been associated
with increased breast cancer risk in women with low folate
status (21) and also in women with high BMI, high plasma TGs,
and abnormal oxidation of low-density lipoproteins (20, 22–
26), all of which are associated with increased risk of certain
cancers including breast cancer (27, 28).

Studies on associations of plasma homocysteine (21, 29–32),
folate (29, 30, 32–34), vitamin B-12 (30, 32, 33), and vitamin
B-6 (30, 32, 33) with breast cancer risk have produced mixed
results. To our knowledge, no previous study has assessed the
effect of plasma riboﬂavin on breast cancer risk. We carried out a
case-control study, nested in the EPIC (European Prospective
Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition)8-Varese cohort, to
prospectively evaluate whether plasma levels of homocysteine,
folate, vitamin B-12, vitamin B-6, and riboﬂavin were associated
with risk of breast cancer, and risk of breast cancer subtypes
were deﬁned by expression of hormone receptors.

Methods

Study population and data collection. This was a case-control study
nested in the women participating in the EPIC-Varese cohort study,
which was part of the larger EPIC (European Investigation into Cancer
and Nutrition). We considered 6071 women deﬁned by the following
eligibility criteria: recruitment to the prospective Hormones and Diet in
the Etiology of Breast Cancer (ORDET) study in 1987–1992, recruit-
ment to EPIC-Varese in 1993–1998 (70% of women who participated in
ORDET were subsequently recruited in EPIC-Varese), and either
premenopausal or postmenopausal at the ORDET and EPIC baselines
(perimenopausal women and those with uncertain menopausal status
were excluded).

The date of entry to the present study was the EPIC recruitment date.
At EPIC baseline, after participants had given written informed consent,
detailed information was collected on reproductive and medical history,
physical activity, alcohol consumption, smoking, education, and other
socioeconomic variables by using a standardized lifestyle questionnaire.
Diet over the previous year was investigated by using a food frequency
questionnaire speciﬁcally developed to capture local dietary habits. Also
at baseline, weight, height, and blood pressure were measured, and a
30-mL fasting blood sample was collected by using standardized
procedures. The blood samples were divided into 0.5-mL aliquots of
plasma, serum, red blood cells, and buffy coat on the day of collection
and stored in liquid nitrogen at 2196°C (35).

All study participants had also been recruited to the earlier ORDET
study and at ORDET baseline had given a blood sample. The stored
plasma samples were analyzed, and the results of these analyses were
combined with those obtained from the samples collected at the EPIC
baseline, so as to obtain mean estimates that were more reliable than
those provided by a single measurement. The study protocol was
approved by the ethics committee of the Foundation National Cancer
Institute, Scientiﬁc Institute for Care and Treatment (IRCCS), (Milan, Italy).

Breast cancer cases and selection of control women. The 6071
women were followed up to 31 December 2009 (median 14.9 y) through
the Lombardy Cancer Registry, Varese Province, characterized by high
data completeness and quality. A total of 276 new breast cancer cases
were identiﬁed among the women over the follow-up period from the
registry database. Information on estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone
receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER2)
expression of the cancers was obtained from electronic pathology
reports.

For each case, one matched control was chosen, by using an incidence
density sampling protocol, from appropriate risk sets consisting of
cohort members alive and free of cancer at the time of diagnosis of the
index case. Matching criteria were age at recruitment (6 5 y), date of
recruitment (6 180 d), distance between ORDET and EPIC recruitment
(6 90 d), menopausal status (postmenopausal at both ORDET and EPIC
baseline; premenopausal at ORDET baseline, postmenopausal at EPIC
baseline; premenopausal at ORDET baseline and still premenopausal at
EPIC baseline), and micronutrient analysis in the same batch.

Analysis of plasma samples. Analyses were performed both on EPIC
and ORDET plasma samples. Folate and vitamin B-12 were determined
on a Cobas 8000 modular analyzer (Roche Diagnostic GmbH) by Roche
Elecsys electrochemoluminescence assays. Homocysteine was deter-
mined immunoenzymatically as S-adenosylhomocysteine produced
from serum homocysteine on a Siemens Dimension Vista Lab System
analyzer (Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics Products GmbH). All assays
were performed according to recommendations of the equipment
manufacturers.

Levels of riboﬂavin and vitamin B-6 (the latter as pyridoxal 5#-phosphate,
the principal active form of vitamin B-6) were measured by LC/MS by
using a Thermo Fisher LCQ Vantage mass spectrometer coupled to a
Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc Transcend HPLC system. Perchloric acid
was used to precipitate out proteins from aliquots of plasma to which
had been added appropriate internal standards (15N,13C-labeled
riboﬂavin and 2H-labeled pyridoxal 5#-phosphate). After incubation
at 50°C for 10 min, the treated aliquots were ﬁltered and injected into
the HPLC system and eluted with a water, methanol, ammonium
acetate gradient. The mass spectrometer was operated in single reac-
tion monitoring mode to minimize interference from other compounds.
Use of internal standards made it possible to correct for losses during
puriﬁcation and variation in instrument response. We excluded 17
cases and 18 controls because EPIC or ORDET plasma samples were not
available.

Statistical analysis. We calculated plasma levels of homocysteine,
folate, vitamin B-12, vitamin B-6, and riboﬂavin for each case and
control as the mean of the values from the EPIC and ORDET samples.
CV for each, considering the ORDET and EPIC samples as replicates of a
single sample were as follows: 13% for homocysteine, 16% for folate,

14% for vitamin B-12, 31% for vitamin B-6, and 23% for riboﬂavin.
Plasma levels were grouped into quartiles based on the distribution in
controls. Baseline characteristics of study participants, according to
quartiles of plasma vitamin B-6, were summarized as means and
standard deviations (continuous variables) or frequencies (categorical
variables). Unconditional
logistic regression models were used to
estimate RRs for breast cancer with 95% CIs, with the lowest quartile
as reference; the signiﬁcance of linear trends was assessed by treating
each quartile as a continuous variable in the model and performing the
Wald test. RRs were also calculated for 1-SD increments of micro-
nutrient concentration as a continuous variable. We ran a minimally
adjusted model, with the matching variables as covariates: age (contin-
uous), date of recruitment (continuous), time between ORDET and EPIC
recruitment
(continuous), and menopausal status (premenopausal/
postmenopausal in EPIC). We also ran fully adjusted models, with the
following additional covariates: family history of breast cancer in ﬁrst
degree relatives (yes, no), age at menarche (<15 or $15 y), parity
(nulliparous, 1–2 children, or >2 children), oral contraceptive use (never
or sometime), education (#8 or >8 y), smoking status (never, former, or
current), alcohol consumption (continuous), and BMI (continuous).

We analyzed all women and also analyzed postmenopausal and
premenopausal women separately. P values for interaction between
plasma micronutrient with menopausal status were estimated by adding
the product of quartile of plasma micronutrient with menopausal status
to the model and applying the Wald test. We also analyzed the risk of
developing breast cancer subtypes deﬁned by receptor status. Heteroge-
neity was investigated by the Wald test. We analyzed subgroups deﬁned
by alcohol intake (abstainers, <7 g/d, or $7 g/d) with P interaction
calculated by treating alcohol intake as a dichotomous variable (abstainer
or consumer) and multiplying this by the analyte value (continuous).
We excluded 1 case and 2 controls because confounder variables were
missing; the analyses were thus performed on 514 women, 258 cases,
and 256 controls. All statistical tests were 2-sided, and differences
were considered signiﬁcant for P < 0.05. The analyses were performed
with Stata version 11.2.

Results

Baseline characteristics of study participants by quartiles of
plasma vitamin B-6 are shown in Table 1. Women in the highest
vitamin B-6 quartile tended to have lower BMI, lower plasma
homocysteine, and higher levels of other B vitamins. They were
also better educated and less likely to be smokers, to have used
oral contraceptives, and to have a family history of breast
cancer. Table 2 shows the RRs of developing breast cancer by
quartiles of plasma homocysteine and B vitamins for all study
women. High levels of vitamin B-6 in the continuous model were
associated with decreased breast cancer risk [RR: 0.78; 95% CI:
0.63, 0.96 (fully adjusted model)]; however, no reduction in risk
was found in the analysis based on quartiles. None of the other
micronutrients was signiﬁcantly associated with risk (P trend $
0.31).

Table 3 shows risk estimates by menopausal status at
baseline. Among postmenopausal women, none of the micro-
nutrients was signiﬁcantly associated with breast cancer risk
(P trend $ 0.29). Among premenopausal women, high levels of
vitamin B-6 were associated with signiﬁcantly lowered breast
cancer risk in the continuous model (RR: 0.66; 95% CI: 0.48,
0.92); however, no reduction in risk was found in the analysis
based on quartiles. The highest quartile of plasma riboﬂavin
(compared with the lowest) was also associated with signiﬁcantly
lowered breast cancer risk [RR: 0.45; 95% CI: 0.21, 0.94,
P trend = 0.021 (fully adjusted model)]; there was a signiﬁcant
interaction between menopausal status and plasma riboﬂavin
(P = 0.021). Levels of homocysteine and the other B vitamins
were not signiﬁcantly associated with premenopausal breast

cancer risk (P trend $ 0.22). However, risk in the third quartile
of vitamin B-12 concentration was signiﬁcantly lower than
reference (RR: 0.41; 95% CI: 0.19, 0.92). No interaction was
found between menopausal status and plasma levels of homo-
cysteine (P = 0.44), folate (P = 0.46), vitamin B-12 (P = 0.45),
or vitamin B-6 (P = 0.42).

Associations of plasma homocysteine and B vitamins with
breast cancer subtypes deﬁned by hormonal receptor status are
shown in Supplemental Tables 1–3. The second quartile of
plasma homocysteine was associated with signiﬁcantly de-
creased risk of ER+ disease (RR: 0.54; 95% CI: 0.31, 0.96)
compared with the lowest. Signiﬁcant heterogeneity depending
on ER status was found for plasma folate (P heterogeneity
0.045); however, no signiﬁcant association of folate with either
ER+ (P trend = 0.13) or ER2 (P trend = 0.24) disease was found.
Signiﬁcant heterogeneity depending on ER status was found for
B-12 in the continuous model (P heterogeneity = 0.032); again,
however, no signiﬁcant association was found with either ER+ or
ER2 disease. High vitamin B-6 was associated with lowered risk
(borderline signiﬁcance) of ER+ disease in the continuous model
(RR: 0.79; 95% CI: 0.63, 1.00) (Supplemental Table 1). Vitamin
B-6 in the continuous model was associated with a signiﬁcantly
lowered risk of PR+ disease (RR: 0.72; 95% CI: 0.55, 0.95). The
second quartile of plasma homocysteine was associated with a
signiﬁcantly lowered (by 49%) risk of PR+ disease, and the
second quartile of vitamin B-12 was associated with a signiﬁ-
cantly decreased (by 61%) risk of PR2 disease compared with
the ﬁrst quartile. No signiﬁcant heterogeneity in relation to PR
status was found (P $ 0.22) (Supplemental Table 2). None of the
micronutrients analyzed was associated with the risk of devel-
oping either HER2+ (P trend $ 0.07) or HER22 (P trend $
0.30) disease, and no signiﬁcant heterogeneity in relation to
HER2 status was found (P $ 0.09) (Supplemental Table 3).

When the analyses were stratiﬁed by alcohol intake, plasma
vitamin B-12 was associated with signiﬁcantly increased breast
cancer risk among abstainers (RR: 4.88; 95% CI: 1.16, 20.55 for
the highest compared with the lowest quartile); however, few
cases were available for this subanalysis; P for interaction
between plasma vitamin B-12 and alcohol intake was not
signiﬁcant. High vitamin B-6 was associated with a signiﬁcantly
lowered breast cancer risk among women who drank >7 g/d of
alcohol (RR: 0.71; 95% CI: 0.51, 0.99 in the continuous model);
no association was found for abstainers or women who drank
#7 g/d of alcohol. P for interaction between plasma vitamin B-6
and alcohol intake was not signiﬁcant (P = 0.87) (data not
shown).

Discussion

In this nested case-control study, considering all women, breast
cancer risk decreased with increasing plasma vitamin B-6 levels.
None of the other micronutrients was associated with breast
cancer risk overall. However, when women were separated by
menopausal status, high vitamin B-6 and riboﬂavin were
associated with signiﬁcantly decreased breast cancer risk among
premenopausal women. Although plasma folate and vitamin
B-12 were not signiﬁcantly associated with the risk of breast cancer
subtype deﬁned by ER status, there was signiﬁcant heterogene-
ity, with a nonsigniﬁcantly decreased risk of ER+ disease for high
folate and vitamin B-12 and nonsigniﬁcantly increased risk
of ER2 disease for high folate and vitamin B-12. For increasing
levels of vitamin B-6, the risks of ER+ and PR+ breast cancer
decreased signiﬁcantly, but heterogeneity between receptor-positive

and -negative status was not signiﬁcant. Finally,
increasing
vitamin B-6 was associated with decreasing breast cancer risk
among women who drank >7 g/d of alcohol compared with
those who drank less or abstained.

Previous studies on associations of plasma levels of nutrients
involved in one-carbon metabolism with breast cancer risk
focused mainly on homocysteine and folate. Of 5 studies
concerned with homocysteine, 2 found no association (30, 32),
2 case-control studies found that higher homocysteine levels
were associated with increased breast cancer risk (29, 31), and a
case-control study nested in the WomenÕs Health Study found
that homocysteine levels were not associated with overall breast
cancer risk, but among women with low folate status, the risk
was increased if homocysteine was high (21). We found no
evidence that homocysteine inﬂuenced breast cancer risk.

Our ﬁnding of a null association between plasma folate and
breast cancer risk is in agreement with a nested case-control
study in the Washington County serum bank (30), a case-control
study conducted in Taiwan (29), and a case-control study on
postmenopausal women nested in the Malmo¨ Diet and Cancer
cohort (34). Other studies found a decreased breast cancer risk
for increasing blood folate levels (36, 37), especially in women
whose alcohol intake was high ($15 g/d) (32). Finally, a case-
control study nested in the WomenÕs Health Study found no

association of folate with overall breast cancer risk but deter-
mined that high folate was unexpectedly associated with
increased risks of premenopausal, ER-positive, and PR-positive
breast cancer (33).

To our knowledge, only 3 studies have investigated plasma
vitamin B-12 and breast cancer risk. One found no associa-
tion (33), as did our study; another found that for high B-12,
risks of overall and premenopausal breast cancer decreased (32);
and the other found that risks decreased, especially among
women who were postmenopausal at recruitment (30).

Our ﬁnding that high vitamin B-6 was associated with
signiﬁcantly lowered overall breast cancer risk is not completely
in line with the results of the nested case-control study of
Zhang et al. (32), which found that among postmenopausal
women the association was of borderline signiﬁcance but was
substantial among women who drank less than 15 g/d of
alcohol. Lurie et al. (38) also found that postmenopausal women
with high vitamin B-6 had lowered breast cancer risk, which
appeared limited to women with ER+, PR+, and ER+PR+
cancers. Finally, 2 nested case-control studies found no associ-
ation between plasma vitamin B-6 and overall breast cancer
risk (30, 33).

Our ﬁnding that breast cancer risk was signiﬁcantly lowered
among premenopausal women with high compared with low

plasma riboﬂavin appears unique, because we are aware of no
other study to investigate riboﬂavin/breast cancer associations.
The fact that the association was conﬁned to premenopausal
women is unexpected—but not too unexpected, given the
numerous differences in terms of risk factors, prognosis, and
molecular biology between breast cancer in pre- and postmen-
opausal women; it suggests the need for further research.

Vitamin B-6 and riboﬂavin may lower breast cancer risk
through mechanisms other than one-carbon metabolism, be-
cause they are essential cofactors in numerous reactions central
to human metabolism (39, 40). In addition, vitamin B-6 has been
shown to decrease oxidative stress, cell proliferation, and
angiogenesis and to enhance immune function (39, 41), whereas
low vitamin B-6 concentrations have been associated with high
levels of inﬂammatory markers (42). Certain carcinogens are
metabolized by ﬂavin-dependent enzymes, and the resulting
metabolites may have either increased or decreased carcinoge-
nicity (43). Some studies [reviewed by Powers (44)] suggest
that the risk of certain cancers is increased when riboﬂavin is
deﬁcient.

Furthermore, both riboﬂavin and vitamin B-6 are cofactors in
the pathway by which tryptophan is degraded to kynurenines,
and many products of this pathway are neuroactive compounds
with immunomodulatory effects (45). The same pathway is
stimulated by inﬂammatory molecules and is often systemati-
cally up-regulated during an active immune response (45, 46).
Because inﬂammation has been linked to increased overall
and premenopausal breast cancer risk (47, 48), vitamin B-6

and riboﬂavin status might be linked to breast cancer risk
by inﬂammation-related mechanisms, perhaps involving the
kynurenine pathway. However, few other data are available
to suggest mechanisms by which low riboﬂavin status can
increase the risk of breast cancer—an association we found in
premenopausal women.

Study strengths include prospective design that rendered
reverse causation unlikely as an explanation for the associations
found; the availability of detailed information on lifestyle,
dietary, and anthropometric variables, which made it to possi-
ble to control for potential confounders; and the availability
of 2 plasma samples taken ;5 y apart, which made it possi-
ble to analyze plasma micronutrient levels twice, providing
estimates that are likely to be more reliable than a single
measurement. A possible study limitation is that samples were
collected, stored at 2196°C (EPIC samples) or 280°C (ORDET
samples), and analyzed up to 25 y later. There may have been
differential decay of the analytes over that period. However,
unless analyte decay varied with initial concentration (which
seems unlikely), this will not bias analyte-risk associations. A
stability study conducted on vitamin B-6, vitamin B-12, and folic
acid in plasma with EDTA and riboﬂavin in whole blood found
that no large decline had occurred after 4 y of storage at 220°C
(49). Moreover, the small number of breast cancers diagnosed
will have decreased the power to detect associations, especially in
subgroup analyses. Another limitation is that we performed mul-
tiple statistical comparisons that were not corrected for, thereby
increasing the risk of erroneously rejecting null hypotheses.

Finally, few data are available on biologic mechanisms that could
explain associations between low vitamin B-6 and riboﬂavin status
and increased breast cancer risk, especially among premenopausal
women.

To conclude, the ﬁndings of this case-control study nested in
the EPIC-Varese cohort suggest that high plasma concentrations
of vitamin B-6 may decrease the risk of breast cancer and
particularly of ER+ breast cancer and may also lower the risk in
moderate-to-heavy drinkers (>7 g/d alcohol). High plasma levels
of riboﬂavin may decrease the risk of breast cancer in premen-
opausal but not postmenopausal women. Homocysteine and the
other B vitamins investigated do not seem to inﬂuence breast
cancer risk. Further research is required to elucidate the
mechanisms by which B vitamins can inﬂuence the etiology of
breast cancer.
