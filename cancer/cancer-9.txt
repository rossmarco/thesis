Abstract
The Nutritional Prevention of Cancer Trial was a
randomized, clinical trial designed to evaluate the efficacy
of selenium as selenized yeast (200 ␮g daily) in
preventing the recurrence of nonmelanoma skin cancer
among 1312 residents of the Eastern United States.
Original secondary analyses through December 31, 1993
showed striking inverse associations between treatment
and the incidence of total [hazard ratio (HR) ⴝ 0.61,
95% confidence interval (CI) ⴝ 0.46 – 0.82], lung,
prostate, and colorectal cancer and total cancer mortality.
This report presents results through February 1, 1996,
the end of blinded treatment. Effect modification by
baseline characteristics is also evaluated. The effects of
treatment overall and within subgroups of baseline age,
gender, smoking status, and plasma selenium were
examined using incidence rate ratios and Cox
proportional hazards models. Selenium supplementation
reduced total (HR ⴝ 0.75, 95% CI ⴝ 0.58 – 0.97) and
prostate (HR ⴝ 0.48, 95% CI ⴝ 0.28 – 0.80) cancer
incidence but was not significantly associated with lung
(HR ⴝ 0.74, 95% CI ⴝ 0.44 –1.24) and colorectal (HR ⴝ
0.46, 95% CI ⴝ 0.21–1.02) cancer incidence. The effects
of treatment on other site-specific cancers are also
described. The protective effect of selenium was confined
to males (HR ⴝ 0.67, 95% CI ⴝ 0.50 – 0.89) and was
most pronounced in former smokers. Participants with

baseline plasma selenium concentrations in the lowest two
tertiles (<121.6 ng/ml) experienced reductions in total
cancer incidence, whereas those in the highest tertile
showed an elevated incidence (HR ⴝ 1.20, 95% CI ⴝ
0.77–1.86). The Nutritional Prevention of Cancer trial
continues to show a protective effect of selenium on
cancer incidence, although not all site-specific cancers
exhibited a reduction in incidence. This treatment effect
was restricted to males and to those with lower baseline
plasma selenium concentrations.

Introduction
The NPC4 Trial (1) contributed substantially to the evidence
supporting selenium as a chemopreventive agent. These results,
which have been cited in the medical literature over 400 times
in the last 5 years, have also received considerable public
attention. The study was originally designed to test the efficacy
of selenium supplementation in preventing NMSC recurrence
in men and women with a history of two or more BCCs or one
SCC of the skin. The hypothesis for this trial was supported by
Clark’s observation that populations in the southeastern United
States, a region with soil selenium concentrations lower than
those of the rest of the country, showed elevated NMSC rates
(2). Thus, Clark and colleagues initiated a randomized clinical
trial of selenium supplementation for preventing the recurrence
of NMSC in this high-risk population. The original trial results
failed to confirm that selenium supplementation prevented
NMSC recurrence. Indeed, the incidence of new BCCs was
increased by a nonsignificant 10% among selenium-supple-
mented individuals, whereas the incidence of new SCCs was
increased by an again nonsignificant 14%.

Nevertheless, early in the intervention, an unexpected def-
icit of other cancer and mortality endpoints among selenium-
supplemented participants became apparent, so that in 1993,
endpoints for the trial were expanded to include lung, prostate,
and colorectal cancer, as well as total cancer incidence and total
cancer mortality. In 1994, the Safety Monitoring and Advisory
Committee recommended the trial be unblinded and results
published. The National Cancer Institute audited the study in
May 1995, and, with the National Cancer Institute’s approval,
the blinded phase of patient treatment and follow-up ended in
February 1996. At this time, all participants were informed of
their treatment status, given the opportunity to take selenium
supplements, and reconsented to participate in the Open-Label
Phase of this trial.

The apparent effects of selenium supplementation on can-
cer incidence through the end of 1993 (representing an average
of 6.4 years of subject follow-up) were striking. The original
report indicated that selenium supplementation led to a mar-
ginally statistically significant decrease in (a) lung cancer in-
cidence (HR ⫽ 0.56, 95% CI ⫽ 0.0.31–1.01, P ⫽ 0.05), (b)
statistically significant decreases in prostate cancer incidence
(HR ⫽ 0.35, 95% CI ⫽ 0.18 – 0.65, P ⫽ 0.001), (c) colorectal
cancer incidence (HR ⫽ 0.39, 95% CI ⫽ 0.17– 0.90, P ⫽ 0.03),
(d) total cancer incidence (HR ⫽ 0.61, 95% CI ⫽ 0.46 – 0.82,
P ⬍ 0.001), and (e) total cancer mortality (HR ⫽ 0.48, 95%
CI ⫽ 0.0.31– 0.76, P ⫽ 0.001).

The current report adds considerably to the statistical
precision of this trial by extending the previously reported
results (September 15, 1983 to December 31, 1993) through the
entire blinded phase of the trial (September 15 1983 to February
1, 1996). With total cancer incidence as the primary end point,
mean subject follow-up time was enhanced by 1 year to an
average of 7.4 years. Overall, selenium supplementation con-
tinued to reduce the incidence of total cancer and prostate,
colorectal, and lung cancers, although the reduction in inci-
dence of the latter two cancers was not statistically significant.
Not all site-specific cancers presented in this report exhibited a
reduction in risk with selenium supplementation. In addition,
this analysis describes the effect of selenium supplementation
on total cancer incidence within subgroups defined by key
baseline characteristics including age, gender, smoking status,
and plasma selenium. The protective effect of selenium sup-
plementation on total cancer incidence was most prominent in
males and those with lower baseline plasma selenium concen-
trations. Although the examination of treatment effects in sub-
group analyses is fraught with potential limitations, and the
modest sample size limits statistical power and interpretation,
subgroup analyses in this important dataset provide an oppor-
tunity to evaluate trends in the data, which may further our
understanding of the effectiveness of selenium as a chemopre-
ventive agent.

Materials and Methods
The protocol for the NPC study is described in the original
report by Clark et al. (1). Briefly, this study was a randomized,
double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted among 1312
participants living in the Eastern United States. Participants had
a history of two or more BCCs or one SCC of the skin, with one
of these occurring within the year prior to randomization.
Participants had a life expectancy of at least 5 years and had had
no internal malignancies treated within the previous 5 years.
Exclusion criteria included a history of significant liver or
kidney disorders. Although recruitment was gender neutral,
approximately three-quarters of the participants were male.

This study was conducted in dermatology clinics in seven
cities located in low-selenium areas of the United States, including
Augusta, Georgia; Macon, Georgia; Columbia, South Carolina;
Miami, Florida; Wilson, North Carolina; Greenville, North Caro-
lina; and Newington, Connecticut. Recruitment began on Septem-
ber 15, 1983 and continued each year through 1991. Participants
were randomized in a double-blinded fashion to the experimental
treatment or an identical placebo. Experimental participants were
treated with 200 ␮g of selenium supplied in a 0.5-g high-selenium
baker’s yeast tablet provided by Nutrition 21 (La Jolla, CA)
through 1995 and by Cypress Systems (Fresno, CA) thereafter.
The selenium content of each batch of pills was determined in the
laboratories of Dr. G. F. Combs, Jr. and of Dr. I. S. Palmer (South
Dakota State University, Brookings, SD) using the diaminonaptha-

lene-fluorometric procedure after nitric-perchloric acid digestion
(3). Plasma selenium concentration was determined in the labora-
tory of Dr. G. F. Combs, Jr. by automated electrothermal atomic
absorption spectrophotometry (Perkin-Elmer 3030; Perkin-Elmer
Corp., Norwalk, CT) equipped with an electrodeless discharge
lamp and automatic Zeeman-effect background correction. Quality
control included multiple aliquots of human plasma as external
control samples. A coefficient of variation of ⬍7% (for duplicate
analyses) was the criterion for acceptance (4).

At the baseline interview, sociodemographic and behav-
ioral variables including education (number of years of school-
ing, 0 –18), occupation (classified according to NIH standards),
numbers of years on farm, use of vitamin supplements, use of
sunscreen, cancer screening information, number of alcoholic
drinks/day, smoking status (current, former, never), number of
cigarettes smoked/day, and years of smoking were collected
from the participants. In addition, a thorough medical and
medication history was obtained at baseline and updated at each
biannual follow-up visit. Patient medical records from each
clinic were reviewed periodically to ascertain information from
both study and nonstudy visits to ensure the completeness and
accuracy of the information. For participants who became in-
active, annual contact was attempted using the National Death
Index and ChoicePoint (formerly Equifax Inc.) to determine
vital status and identify diagnoses of new illnesses. In the event
of reports of new illnesses or medical procedures, research
nurses requested medical, surgical, and pathology records from
physicians in hospitals for documentation. Searches for addi-
tional cases of cancer were also performed at each state tumor
registry in which a clinic site was located. An oncologist or
appropriate medical specialist reviewed every cancer record
and confirmed the diagnosis. A nosologist coded the death
certificates. Review and coding of all records occurred in a
blinded manner.

At the end of the blinded period of treatment on February
2, 1996, 35.9% of participants were still on treatment, 16.6%
were off treatment but still having routine dermatological ex-
aminations, 22.1% of participants were censored for dermato-
logical endpoints but not other endpoints, and 24.8% had died.
After a total of 9301 PY of follow-up, no participants were lost
to vital follow-up, and only seven subjects (three in the sele-
nium group and four in the placebo group) declined to provide
additional illness information. Participant-reported compliance
indicated that 79.3% of participants (80.3% in the placebo
group and 78.4% in the selenium group) missed taking a pill
less than twice a month.

Sixty-two participants (including two cancer cases in each
treatment group) whose initial blood draws were drawn ⬎4
days after the randomization date were excluded from the
analysis. Thus, all statistical analyses were based on data from
those 1250 participants with initial blood draws within 4 days
of randomization. Results obtained from the total cohort of
1312 participants and the subsample of 1250 participants with
valid baseline selenium values (621 participants in the selenium
group and 629 participants in the placebo group) showed no
significant differences when continuous (age, BMI, and plasma
selenium concentrations) and categorical (gender and smoking
status) baseline variables were compared using t tests and ␹2
tests, respectively. In addition, no significant differences in
incidence data from the total cohort and subsample of the NPC
participants were detected.

Within the subsample of 1250 NPC participants, t tests and
␹2 tests were conducted to determine any differences in the
distribution of these baseline variables between treatment
groups. PY of follow-up were calculated among the subsample

of 1250 subjects. For subjects without cancer, PY were com-
puted using the date of randomization as the start date, and the
earlier of February 1, 1996 or the date of death as the closing
date. PY of follow-up for cancer cases were calculated through
the date of the first category-specific, postrandomization pri-
mary cancer diagnosis (excluding NMSC) documented in pa-
thology, surgery, or medical reports. Participants with multiple
cancers at different sites were counted only once in the analysis
of total cancer incidence and once in each site-specific analysis
in which an incident cancer was diagnosed.

Total cancer incidence data between treatment groups
were analyzed statistically through the comparison of Nelson-
Aalen (5) cumulative hazard function estimates calculated at
different time points of the trial and the two-sided log-rank test.
RRs, calculated using the ratio of the incidence density for the
treatment groups, and the corresponding 95% CIs for site-
specific and total cancer incidence and total cancer mortality
were calculated. Ps were derived from log-rank tests. Support-
ing analyses included the calculation of HRs and 95% CIs using
the Cox proportional hazards model, which allowed adjustment
for age at baseline (continuous variable), gender, and smoking
status (never, former, current) as covariates when appropriate.
Throughout this report, results of both the incidence rate ratio
and Cox proportional hazards models will be displayed in the
tables, although only the latter will be presented in the text.
Among the 1250 participants with baseline blood draws within
4 days of randomization, the effect of selenium supplementa-
tion on total cancer incidence was assessed within subgroups
determined by baseline characteristics. Effect modification by
median age (65 years), gender, and smoking status (never,
former, current) at randomization was tested using the Mantel-
Haenszel test for heterogeneity in the unadjusted models. The
statistical significance of the interaction between each baseline
characteristic and treatment group, adjusted for other important
baseline variables, was tested in a Cox proportional hazards
model that included this interaction and the corresponding main
effect terms, in addition to the variables for the adjustment.

The statistical association between total cancer incidence
and concentrations of baseline plasma selenium was also de-
termined. Based on the distribution among the 1250 partici-
pants with valid values, baseline plasma selenium concentra-
tions were divided by the median (ⱕ113.4 ng/ml and ⬎113.4
ng/ml) and by tertiles (ⱕ105.2 ng/ml, 105.3–121.6 ng/ml, and
⬎121.6 ng/ml). The effect of selenium supplementation on
total cancer incidence was assessed within these subgroups of
baseline plasma selenium with the same techniques used for the
analyses within subgroups of baseline age, gender, and smok-
ing status.

Fig. 1. Cumulative incidence of total cancer in the NPC Trial by treatment
group.

HRs, 95% CIs, and tests of statistical significance adjusted
for age, gender, and smoking status at baseline were calculated
to determine the association between baseline plasma selenium
concentrations and the subsequent development of total cancer,
according to treatment group. To confirm the consistency of
this association, three different measures of baseline plasma
selenium were used: (a) as a continuous variable (each unit ⫽
10 ng/ml); (b) by the median value; and (c) by tertiles. The
subgroups below the median or in the first tertile of baseline
plasma selenium were used as the referent groups in their
respective models. Tests for trends in the effects of baseline
plasma selenium across tertiles were conducted using the tertile
number as a continuous term in Cox proportional hazards
models.

All techniques were implemented using STATA 6.0 (6).

Results
Selected baseline characteristics of participants, by treatment
group, are displayed in Table 1. The treatment groups were well
balanced for all evaluated baseline characteristics. At random-
ization, the mean age was 63.4 years among participants ran-
domized to selenium and 63.0 years among those randomized
to placebo. The mean BMI (kg/m2) and proportions of current,
never, and former smokers at baseline did not vary appreciably
across treatment groups. The mean baseline plasma selenium
concentrations were 114.4 and 114.0 ng/ml for selenium- and
placebo-supplemented individuals, respectively. The distribu-
tions of baseline plasma selenium by median and tertile were
almost identical across treatment groups.

At unblinding (February 1, 1996), the trial had 9301 PY of
follow-up (4694 and 4607 years for the selenium and placebo
groups, respectively). Throughout this period, 242 cases of
incident cancer were diagnosed. Of these, 105 occurred in the
selenium-supplemented group, and 137 occurred in the place-
bo-supplemented group. Total cancer cumulative incidence
curves over time since randomization are shown in Fig. 1.
Cumulative incidence was lower among those receiving sele-
nium than among those receiving placebo, throughout the entire
trial. At the end of the study, the selenium group showed a
significantly lower incidence (25%) of total cancer (HR ⫽ 0.75,
95% CI ⫽ 0.58 – 0.97, P ⫽ 0.03) than the placebo group (Table

selenium is diminished slightly by the inclusion of 25 months
of additional follow-up.

Analyses by cancer site are displayed in Table 3. The most
frequent site-specific cancer in this cohort was prostate cancer
(n ⫽ 64), closely followed by lung cancer (n ⫽ 60) and then by
colorectal cancer (n ⫽ 28). Prostate cancer incidence was
significantly reduced by selenium supplementation (HR ⫽
0.48, 95% CI ⫽ 0.28 – 0.80, P ⫽ 0.005); lung cancer incidence
showed a nonsignificant 26% reduction (HR ⫽ 0.74, 95% CI ⫽
0.44 –1.24, P ⫽ 0.26), and colorectal cancer incidence exhib-
ited a marginally significant reduction of 54% (HR ⫽ 0.46,
95% CI ⫽ 0.21–1.02, P ⫽ 0.057). Selenium-supplemented
individuals experienced nonsignificant reductions in incidence
for other carcinomas (thyroid, pancreatic, gastric, renal, endo-
metrial, mesothelioma, and unknown primary), other noncarci-
nomas (glioblastoma, Kaposi’s sarcoma, astrocytoma, histiocy-
toma, liposarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, and sarcoma), and cancer
of the esophagus. Conversely, participants supplemented with
selenium showed nonsignificantly increased incidence of five
of the other specific cancers, including melanoma, bladder
cancer, breast cancer, head and neck cancer, lymphoma, and
leukemia, compared with those supplemented with placebo
(Table 3).

Table 3 also shows total cancer mortality by treatment
group. One hundred and six cancer deaths occurred throughout
the trial. Of these, 40 were among selenium-supplemented
individuals, and 66 were among placebo-supplemented partic-
ipants (HR ⫽ 0.59, 95% CI ⫽ 0.39 – 0.87, P ⫽ 0.008).

The effects of selenium supplementation on total cancer
incidence within subgroups defined by baseline cancer risk
factors are shown in Table 4. There was no evidence that the
effect of selenium supplementation was related to age at base-
line. The adjusted treatment effects for males and females were
0.67 (95% CI ⫽ 0.50 – 0.89, P ⫽ 0.005) and 1.20 (95% CI ⫽

0.66 –2.20, P ⫽ 0.55), respectively. Thus, any protective treat-
ment effect in the study was confined to males. Multivariate
adjustment for age and smoking status did not alter the treat-
ment effects within either gender subgroup. Ps for heterogene-
ity and interaction were not statistically significant.

Table 4 also presents subgroup analysis by baseline cigarette
smoking status. Selenium supplementation decreased unadjusted
total cancer incidence, although not significantly so, for each
category of smoking status (never, former, and current smokers).
Similar treatment effects were observed in never smokers (HR ⫽
0.81, 95% CI 0.47–1.41, P ⫽ 0.46) and current smokers
(HR ⫽ 0.86, 95% CI 0.56–1.31, P ⫽ 0.47). Former smokers
experienced a statistically significant treatment benefit (HR ⫽
0.66, 95% CI ⫽ 0.44–0.97, p ⫽ 0.04). Nevertheless, Ps for
heterogeneity and interaction were not statistically significant.

The report by Clark et al. (7), which described a more
extensive analysis of incident prostate cancer in the 1983–1993
dataset, indicated that the effect of selenium supplementation
was strongest among participants with the lowest baseline
plasma selenium concentrations (RR ⫽ 0.08, P ⫽ 0.002 for
individuals with baseline plasma selenium concentrations
⬍106.4 ng/ml). We investigated the association between sele-
nium supplementation and the incidence of total cancer across
strata of baseline plasma selenium (Table 5). A statistically
significant inverse association between selenium supplementa-
tion and total cancer incidence was apparent in participants
below the median baseline selenium (HR ⫽ 0.62, 95% CI ⫽
0.43– 0.90, P ⫽ 0.01), whereas those above the median value at
baseline experienced a nonsignificant reduction in incidence
(HR ⫽ 0.91, 95% CI ⫽ 0.63–1.30, P ⫽ 0.60). However, a
significant interaction between treatment group and baseline
plasma selenium divided by the median concentration was not
apparent (P for interaction ⫽ 0.14).

As a means of exploring the nature of this interaction, we
present the HRs for total cancer according to baseline selenium

status within treatment group. Table 6 presents these HRs, 95%
CIs, and tests of statistical significance, relating baseline
plasma selenium concentrations to the subsequent development
of total cancer. HRs were calculated using three different ex-
posure measures of baseline plasma selenium: (a) as a contin-
uous variable (each unit ⫽ 10 ng/ml); (b) by the median value;
and (c) by tertiles.

A strong positive association between baseline plasma
selenium and the incidence of total cancer is seen within the
selenium group for the continuous, dichotomous, and trichot-
omous analyses of baseline selenium concentrations. When
baseline plasma selenium is treated as a continuous variable,

selenium supplementation increased total cancer incidence by
12% (HR ⫽ 0.12, 95% CI ⫽ 1.03–1.22, P ⫽ 0.005) for every
unit (where 1 unit ⫽ 10 ng/ml) increase in baseline plasma
selenium concentration. When selenium is treated as a dichot-
omous variable, the comparison of total cancers above the
median with those below the median yielded a HR of 1.45 (95%
CI ⫽ 0.98 –2.15, P ⫽ 0.06). Using the first baseline selenium
tertile as the referent group among selenium-supplemented
subjects, the HR was 1.29 (95% CI ⫽ 0.78 –2.15, P ⫽ 0.32) in
the second tertile and 1.88 (95% CI ⫽ 1.15–3.05, P ⫽ 0.01) in
the third tertile of baseline plasma selenium. The trend for this
association was statistically significant (P ⫽ 0.01). Thus, the
trichotomous analysis revealed that among selenium-supple-
mented participants, those in the third tertile experienced an
almost 2-fold, statistically significant elevation of incidence
compared with participants in the first tertile.

The association of baseline plasma selenium and total
cancer in the placebo group, albeit weak, was in the protective
direction, with individuals of higher status showing a lower
incidence of total cancer (Table 6). There was a nonsignificant
decrease in incidence of total cancer with increasing baseline
selenium in increments of 10 ng/ml (HR ⫽ 0.97, 95% CI ⫽
0.90 –1.05, P ⫽ 0.49). The decrease in incidence was also
nonsignificant when comparing the effects of baseline selenium
above the median, as opposed to below the median (HR ⫽ 0.95,
95% CI ⫽ 0.68 –1.34, P ⫽ 0.79). This nonsignificant reduction
in total cancer incidence is again apparent in the comparison of
tertiles of baseline plasma selenium. Using the first tertile as the
referent group, the HR was 0.88 (95% CI ⫽ 0.59 –1.31, P ⫽
0.52) in the second and 0.76 (95% CI ⫽ 0.50 –1.16, P ⫽ 0.20)
in the third tertile. The P for trend in this trichotomous analysis
was 0.20.

Discussion
The NPC Trial is the only double-blind, placebo-controlled, ran-
domized trial to date to have tested the effect of selenium supple-
mentation on cancer incidence in a Western population. The orig-
inal secondary analyses of the NPC data showed a highly
significant inverse association of selenium supplementation with
the incidence of total cancer through December 31, 1993, over a
mean period of 6.4 years of follow-up (1). In this report, we
describe analyses of the effect of selenium supplementation on
total cancer incidence through the end of randomized, blinded
treatment (February 1, 1996). This extended follow-up attenuated
the protective effect of selenium supplementation on total cancer
incidence, although selenium supplementation continued to reduce
the incidence of total cancer over a mean follow-up of more than
7 years. A significant inverse association with the most common
cancer, prostate cancer, was observed. For the next most common
sites, lung and colorectal cancers, respectively, inverse but non-
significant associations with selenium supplementation and inci-
dence were determined. These results are consistent with the
majority of epidemiological studies that support the efficacy of
selenium as a chemopreventive agent against all cancers (8–16)
and prostate (17–19), lung (12, 20–24), and colorectal cancers
(25–28). However, not all epidemiological trials consistently
support a protective association between selenium and cancer
(26, 29 – 41).

Of the remaining eight cancer sites evaluated in this report,
nonsignificant reductions in incidence were apparent in three
categories: (a) other carcinomas; (b) other noncarcinomas; and
(c) esophageal cancer. Results from epidemiological trials on
these three cancer categories have been inconsistent (41– 45).
Conversely, nonsignificant increases in incidence were

evident in five cancer types, including melanoma, bladder can-
cer, breast cancer, head and neck cancer, and lymphoma and
leukemia. These results, although nonsignificant and based on
small case numbers, may indicate potential increased risk with
selenium supplementation. Previous reports on the effects of
selenium on melanoma (24, 46 – 49), bladder cancer (33, 48,
50), head and neck cancer (51–53), and lymphoma and leuke-
mia (24, 37, 41, 54) in epidemiological trials have been varied.
The evidence associating selenium status and breast cancer is
conflicting. Analogous to that observed in the NPC Trial,
several prospective studies have shown nonsignificant positive
associations between serum (24) and toenail (55, 56) selenium
status and breast cancer. However, the lack of an association
between serum (57), toenail (58), and four indicators (59) of
selenium status and breast cancer risk has been suggested by
several case-control studies. Similarly, several prospective tri-
als have shown equivocal associations between serum (37, 60)
and toenail (61) selenium status and breast cancer risk. Many
case-control studies have suggested a protective effect of higher
selenium status (26, 62, 63) in postmenopausal but not pre-
menopausal women (64). In addition, inverse trends between
breast cancer and selenium concentrations in serum (29), toe-
nails (65), and drinking water (41) have been suggested in
prospective trials, although results were nonsignificant. More-
over, significant inverse associations between breast cancer risk
and serum (66 – 68) and hair (23) selenium have been docu-
mented.

Methodological issues, primarily the difficulty of assess-
ing long-term selenium exposure, may explain some of the
inconsistencies in the association of selenium and cancer re-
ported from epidemiological trials (69). In addition, treatment
and disease may alter selenium status and thus may lead to
temporal ambiguity and misclassification of selenium status.
Nevertheless, a meta-analysis of cohort studies comparing as-
sociations of serum selenium, retinol, ␤-carotene, and vitamin
E with cancer suggests that selenium has a remarkably consist-
ent protective effect (70).

Furthermore, evidence for the chemopreventive efficacy of
selenium has been consistently represented in laboratory trials,
although the exact mechanism(s) of its activity is unclear. The
overwhelming majority of in vivo studies in rodents have shown
that various forms of selenium inhibit carcinogen-induced co-
valent DNA adduct formation and retard oxidative damage to
DNA, lipids, and proteins at multiple organ sites (71). In vitro and
in vivo systems have shown that tumor cell growth, cell prolifer-
ation, and cell cycle biomarkers; apoptosis; p53 expression;
cyclooxygenase 2 expression; DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis;
the activation of transcriptional factors activator protein 1 and
nuclear factor ␬B; the activities of protein kinase C and protein
kinase A, thymidine kinase, c-Jun-NH2-kinase, and DNA cytosine
methyltransferase; and 8-isoprostane formation are modified by
various forms of selenium treatment (71).
Effect Modification. Several potential effect modifiers for the
effect of selenium supplementation on total cancer were pre-
sented in this analysis, including age at baseline, gender, and
baseline smoking and plasma selenium statuses. Our data sug-
gest that gender and baseline plasma selenium status predict the
effect of selenium supplementation on total cancer.
Gender. The high proportion of males in the trial reflects the
higher age-adjusted incidence of NMSC among men living in
the United States (for BCC, 247/100,000 PY for males and
150/100,000 PY for females; for SCC, 65/100,000 and 24/
100,000 PY for males and females, respectively) (72). The
difference in the participation of women also reflects the reli-

Se Supplementation and Cancer Incidence: The NPC Trial

ance on three Veterans Administration hospitals for subject
recruitment, where there was an overwhelming preponderance
of males among the potentially eligible patients. Whereas the
recruitment of patients was gender blind, it is likely that the
lower number of females in the trial and their lower incidence
of cancer limited the power to investigate the interaction be-
tween gender and treatment. Thus, the apparent interaction
between gender and treatment was not statistically significant,
and the overall protective treatment effect was detectable only
among males. Moreover, although the effect in men appeared to
be concentrated in those whose baseline plasma selenium con-
centrations were below the median or in the lowest tertiles,
baseline plasma selenium status did not modify the treatment
effect among women (data not shown).

This discrepancy in the effect of selenium supplementa-
tion on cancer protection by gender has also been noted else-
where. A case-control study of total cancer mortality nested
within a prospective trial of 10,532 persons in the Netherlands
showed that among males, the mean serum selenium for cases
was significantly less than that for controls and that the adjusted
risk of cancer mortality for the lowest quintile of serum sele-
nium (⬍100.8 ng/ml) was more than twice that of men with
higher concentrations (RR ⫽ 2.7, 90% CI ⫽ 1.2– 6.2; Ref. 30).
In females, however, selenium concentrations were similar
among cases and controls, with no evidence of increased cancer
mortality associated with low serum selenium (30). Similar
results were observed in a longitudinal study of 39,268 men and
women participating in the Finnish Social Insurance Institu-
tion’s Mobile Clinic Health Examination Survey (29).

Effect modification by gender may be attributed in part to
gender differences in selenium metabolism. In a European
study, females excreted significantly higher amounts of sele-
nium per kilogram of body weight compared with males (73).
Furthermore, whole-body residence time and body load ad-
justed for body weight have been estimated to be greater in
males than females (74). Patterson et al. (74) speculated that
these gender differences might reflect hormonal differences and
the strong affinity of the testes for selenium. Thus, future
chemoprevention trials may need to consider dose adjustments
for gender (74) or whether large numbers of women should be
included in the study samples. Clearly, we need to further
evaluate how gender may modify the effect of selenium on
cancer outcomes.
Smoking. After adjustment for age and gender, selenium sup-
plementation was associated with a statistically significant re-
duction in total cancer incidence among former smokers and
with nonsignificant reductions among never and current smok-
ers. This is consistent with the proposal that former smokers are
an ideal target population for chemoprevention trials (75, 76).
The ␣-Tocopherol ␤-Carotene Cancer Prevention Study Group
(77) documented a nonsignificant reduction in lung cancer
incidence with ␣-tocopherol and increased lung cancer inci-
dence with ␤-carotene in heavy current smokers. Cumulative
and continuing exposure to tobacco smoke may have over-
whelmed the effect of chemopreventive agents usually associ-
ated with early initiation and promotion stages of carcinogen-
esis (78).
Baseline Plasma Selenium. Clark et al. (1) reported that se-
lenium supplementation had the greatest effect on prostate
cancer prevention in men from this trial with the lowest base-
line plasma selenium status. In the current analyses, the pro-
tective effect of treatment on total cancer incidence was like-
wise confined to participants in the lowest tertile of baseline
plasma selenium. Moreover, a formal interaction between base-

line plasma selenium by tertile and treatment was detected in
this analysis. Modification of the association between treatment
and cancer incidence by baseline status of the supplemented
nutrient is strikingly similar to the treatment effects for prostate
cancer observed in the PHS (79, 80). Within the placebo group
of the PHS, those in the lowest versus the highest quartile of
baseline plasma ␤-carotene experienced a marginally signifi-
cant increased risk of prostate cancer (RR ⫽ 1.45, 95% CI ⫽
0.98 –2.15), with a marginally significant P for trend over
plasma quartiles. However, men in the lowest quartile randomly
assigned to ␤-carotene supplementation had a significant re-
duction in prostate cancer risk (RR ⫽ 0.68, 95% CI ⫽ 0.46 –
0.99) compared with those assigned to placebo. Supplementa-
tion of those in the highest baseline quartile was associated with
a nonsignificant increase in risk (RR ⫽ 1.33, 95% CI ⫽
0.91–1.96). Thus, ␤-carotene supplementation in the PHS re-
duced the risk of prostate cancer only among those individuals
with low baseline plasma ␤-carotene levels.

In the current analysis of the NPC Trial, attempts to glean
information on the nature of the effect modification of selenium
treatment by baseline plasma selenium reveal a complex and
confusing pattern, one that is not entirely consistent with our
understanding of selenium as protective against cancer. Indeed,
these results clearly indicate the lack of a protective effect
among participants whose baseline plasma selenium concen-
trations were in the upper tertile. It is noteworthy that this group
of participants was selected on the basis of residency in an area
in which the selenium intake was likely to be lower than in
other regions of the United States. Thus, these results provide
little support for the use of 200 ␮g selenium/day to protect
against cancer among average-risk individuals with plasma
concentrations at or above the United States estimated average
of 123 ng/ml (mean ⫾ SD serum selenium in 16,693 subjects
obtained from the Third National Health and Nutrition Exam-
ination Survey (NHANES III) was 123 ⫾ 17 ng/ml (81).

In addition, among selenium-supplemented individuals,
we observe a striking association; those with higher baseline
concentrations experienced an elevated incidence of cancer. A
pattern of modestly decreased incidence among placebo partic-
ipants coupled with no risk gradient among treated participants
seems somewhat plausible; however, the pattern we observed
was clearly unpredicted and unsettling. It is critical that this
effect be further evaluated in carefully controlled mechanistic
studies.

There are several limitations in this study. First, as men-
tioned earlier, total and site-specific cancers (excluding NMSC)
were not primary endpoints of the NPC Trial (82). Neverthe-
less,
the ascertainment of these endpoints did not change
throughout the entirety of the trial through February 1, 1996.
Second, this trial possessed differential statistical power to
detect an overall treatment effect in males versus females, as
well as for gender-specific cancers. An adequately powered
hypothesis-driven biomarker study should thus be conducted in
females, before women are included in large-scale chemopre-
vention trials with selenium. A third limitation is the inherent
difficulty in the assessment of selenium status. Due to varia-
tions in levels of the element between foodstuffs and the un-
certainty about the availability for absorption of the different
forms of the element, simple measures of dietary selenium
intake indicative of the general status of a population are not
sufficient for determining selenium status in individuals (83). It
is therefore necessary to measure biochemical concentrations of
selenium in the body and not simply gross intake (83). Ideally,
the combination of two or more indices of selenium status
would ensure a more accurate assessment. However, because

98.5% of the NPC participants had plasma selenium concen-
trations greater than the 70 –90 ng/ml required to maximize
plasma selenoproteins (84, 85), plasma selenium was the only
index used to measure selenium status in this trial. Although
plasma selenium concentrations reflect long-term selenium sta-
tus in populations with relatively constant selenium intakes, it
seems prudent that future selenium chemoprevention trials in-
clude multiple sequential plasma measures before randomiza-
tion to more accurately define an individual’s baseline plasma
selenium status.

Finally, although the incidence estimates were adjusted for
potential confounders such as age, gender, and smoking status,
the lack of detailed information on unmeasured risk factors
such as family history of cancer, physical activity level, bio-
chemical status of other nutrients, and dietary intake data from
foods and alcohol
is a possible limitation. Randomization
should minimize the likelihood of confounding by these factors.
However, it is noteworthy that, during 1994 –1995, plasma
selenium concentrations measured in 1134 British people ages
65 years and over were strongly and directly correlated with
plasma zinc, cholesterol, vitamin C, several carotenoids, and
␣-tocopherol, independent of age (86). Thus, future investiga-
tions of this cohort will consider the impact of other antioxi-
dants, including the tocopherols and carotenoids, on cancer
incidence and the extent to which they may modulate the effect
of selenium supplementation. In addition, we plan to conduct
genotype analyses on the study cohort to determine the effect of
selenium supplementation on the activity of the inducible en-
zyme thiolmethyltransferase, which is critical in the methyla-
tion of selenium compounds; the prevalence of genetic poly-
morphisms of key genes
in selenium and carcinogen
metabolism, including thiolmethyltransferase, classical gluta-
thione peroxidase (GSHPx-1; Refs. 87 and 88), and the recently
identified Mr 15,000 selenoprotein (89); and the effect of these
polymorphisms on cancer incidence and response to selenium
supplementation.

In conclusion, this summary analysis of the NPC Trial,
which includes data from the entire period of blinded treatment,
continues to provide support for the efficacy of selenium sup-
plementation in reducing total cancer incidence, total cancer
mortality, and the incidence of prostate cancer and, to a lesser
extent, lung and colorectal cancer. Not all site-specific cancers
exhibited a reduction in incidence, although small case numbers
limit the precision of our data. Indeed, the incidences of several
site-specific cancers, including breast cancer, were nonsignifi-
cantly increased with an average of 7.4 years of follow-up. The
protective effect of selenium supplementation on total cancer
incidence was most prominent in males and in those with lower
baseline plasma selenium concentrations. Those participants
with baseline plasma selenium concentrations above the United
States average showed a nonsignificant elevated incidence of
total cancer. Our data suggest that effect modification of the
association between selenium supplementation and cancer in-
cidence (and/or biomarkers of carcinogenesis) by baseline
plasma selenium status should be monitored and assessed in
ongoing and future selenium prevention trials including those
underway at the University of Arizona (90) and the recently
initiated Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial (91).
Future research studies should evaluate selenium metab-
olism and the effect of supplementation on genetic biomarkers
of cancer risk in males and females to identify disparities that
may account for the apparent differences in the chemopreven-
tive effects of selenium between genders. Future studies should
also assess the effect of selenium supplementation on these
biomarkers in populations of varying selenium status both

within the United States and around the world to help elucidate
the mechanism by which selenium status mediates the chemo-
preventive activity of this element.
