Abstract

Background: To our knowledge, no previous study has evaluated the associations of antioxidant intake with the risk of

ovarian cancer in African-American women, who are known to have high mortality from the disease.

Objective: We sought to evaluate these associations among 406 ovarian cancer cases and 632 age- and site-matched

controls of African-American descent recruited from AACES (African American Cancer Epidemiology Study), a population-

based, case-control study in 11 geographical areas within the United States.

Methods: Multivariable logistic regression models were used to estimate ORs and 95% CIs adjusted for a wide range of

potentially confounding factors, including age, region, education, parity, oral contraceptive use, menopause, tubal ligation,

family history, body mass index (BMI), smoking status, total energy, and physical activity.
Results: Women with the highest intakes of supplemental selenium (>20 mg/d) had an ;30% lower risk of ovarian cancer
than those with no supplemental intake (OR: 0.67; 95% CI: 0.46, 0.97; P-trend = 0.035). This inverse association was
stronger in current smokers (OR: 0.13; 95% CI: 0.04, 0.46; P-trend = 0.001). There was no association with dietary
selenium. The associations with carotenoid intakes were weak and nonsigniﬁcant (P = 0.07–0.60). We observed no

association with dietary or supplemental intake of vitamin C or vitamin E. There were no appreciable differences in results

between serous and nonserous tumors.

Conclusions: These ﬁndings provide the ﬁrst insights, to our knowledge, into the potential association between

antioxidants and ovarian cancer in African-American women, indicating potential inverse associations with supplemental
selenium. J Nutr 2017;147:621–7.

Introduction

Ovarian cancer is a leading cause of gynecologic cancer death
(1). Given the relatively poor survival of women diagnosed with
the disease and the lack of effective screening tools, identifying
modiﬁable risk factors is essential to reducing ovarian cancer
mortality and morbidity. The etiology of ovarian cancer is
multifactorial, encompassing reproductive, hormonal, genetic,
environmental, and lifestyle factors. Among dietary risk factors,
antioxidant compounds have been of interest. A few studies have
suggested that a high consumption of fruit and vegetables may
decrease ovarian cancer risk, as may the use of antioxidant
supplements (2). An imbalance between free radicals and
antioxidants (oxidative stress) can lead to the formation of

genotoxic lipid peroxidation byproducts and contribute
to progression of ovarian carcinogenesis (3). However, the
number of dietary studies of ovarian cancer is relatively small, and
studies have been conducted almost exclusively in Caucasian
women. Hence, the association between antioxidant intake and
ovarian cancer risk in African-American women is virtually
unexplored. This may be an important gap in knowledge given
the results of studies that suggest the possibility of higher levels of
oxidative stress in African Americans (4, 5), lower intakes of
antioxidants (6, 7), different lifestyle correlates of antioxidant
levels (8), and stronger associations between antioxidant intake
and cancer risk in African Americans (6, 9). To address this lack
of evidence and to allow comparisons with other populations,

we evaluated associations of commonly studied antioxidants with
risk of ovarian cancer in a large, population-based, multi-
center case-control study of women enrolled in AACES (African
American Cancer Epidemiology Study).

Methods

Design and participants. This study was conducted among women
of African-American descent recruited into AACES, an ongoing,
population-based, case-control study of ovarian cancer in 11 sites in the
United States (Alabama, Georgia, Illinois, Louisiana, Michigan, North
Carolina, New Jersey, Ohio, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Texas) (10).
Cases were identiﬁed by rapid case ascertainment utilizing state
cancer registries; Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results
Program registries; or hospitalsÕ gynecologic oncology departments.
Eligible cases include all self-identiﬁed African-American women
between 20 and 79 y of age with newly diagnosed, histologically
conﬁrmed invasive epithelial ovarian cancer. Controls who self-identiﬁed
as African American were selected by using random-digit dialing and
were frequency-matched to cases by 5-y age groups and state of
residence. Women who had a previous history of ovarian cancer or a
bilateral oophorectomy were ineligible controls. Among those who
could be contacted, 66.5% of potential cases and 72% of potential
controls agreed to participate in the main telephone interview. The study
was approved by the Institutional Review Boards at all study sites.

Data were collected by a computer-assisted telephone interview,
which included detailed questions on demographic factors, personal and
family history of cancer, reproductive history, medication use, lifestyle
characteristics, height and weight, and other factors of relevance to
African-American women, such as skin pigmentation, perceived dis-
crimination, and cultural beliefs.

Dietary assessment. We assessed individual exposure levels of
antioxidant nutrients from both food sources and dietary supplements,
speciﬁcally vitamins E and C, carotenoids, and selenium. Dietary
information was assessed via a self-administered Block 2005 FFQ,
which included questions on the usual frequency and portion size for 110
food and beverages consumed over the year preceding diagnosis for cases
or the interview date for controls (11). Usual intake of dietary
supplements of antioxidant nutrients, including multivitamins, was also
collected. Nutrient intakes from diet and supplements were derived by
Block Dietary Data Systems based on the USDA Food and Nutrient
Database for Dietary Studies 1.0. Validation studies of the Block FFQ
have been described elsewhere (11, 12). A previous evaluation showed
that FFQ reliability was high, with Pearson correlation coefﬁcients for

micronutrients from supplements and food ranging from 0.65 to 0.88.
FFQ validity was moderate to high, with attenuated Pearson correlation
coefﬁcients for micronutrients from supplements and food ranging from
0.49 to 0.76 (11). The validity correlation for selenium for this
questionnaire was 0.56.

The present study included 495 cases and 711 controls who completed
the main questionnaire via telephone interview by December 2014. After
excluding 72 cases and 76 controls who had not completed the FFQ for
dietary assessment at time of analysis, 1 case and 3 controls who reported
an extreme energy intake (greater than twice the interquartile range of log
energy intake), and 16 cases subsequently determined to be noneligible by
pathology review, a total of 406 cases and 632 controls remained for the
analysis. We compared characteristics of women completing and not
completing the FFQ and found no difference with respect to age,
education, region, BMI, and smoking (data not shown).

Statistical analyses. We compared the distributions of characteristics
between cases and controls using chi-square tests or t tests as appropriate.
We used Spearman rank correlations to compare casesÕ and controlsÕ
intakes of antioxidants of interest, which were selected a priori and
included total and individual carotenoids, vitamin E, vitamin C, and
selenium. We used unconditional logistic regressions to estimate ORs
and 95% CIs of ovarian cancer by quartile of antioxidant intake; quartiles
were based on the distribution of controls. We investigated dietary (food
sources), supplemental, and total antioxidant intake. For selected antiox-
idants, supplement intake was categorized as no use, medium, and high,
where the latter 2 categories represent supplement users with intakes
below and above the median, respectively. Then, a summary of total
dietary plus supplement was created. The median value of each category
was treated as a continuous variable in tests for linear trends. An a of 0.05
was used to determine statistical signiﬁcance. All statistical analyses were
2-sided and were performed by using SAS version 9.4.

The full multivariable model was adjusted for age, geographic region
(Midwest, South Central, or South Mid-Atlantic), education (high
school or less, some post–high school training, college, or graduate
degree), parity (0, 1–2, or >2), oral contraceptive use (never, <60, or
$60 mo), menopause status (pre- or postmenopause), tubal ligation (no or
yes), ﬁrst-degree family history of breast or ovarian cancer (no or yes),
BMI (in kg/m2) calculated from self-reported weight and height 1 y
before and treated as categorical variable [underweight or normal (<25),
overweight (25–29.9), or obese ($30)], smoking status (never, former,
or current), recreational physical activity (0, <150, or $150 min/wk 1 y
before), and total energy intake. Other covariates as listed in Table
1 (e.g., alcohol consumption and hysterectomy) were evaluated but
were not included in the ﬁnal multivariate model because none changed
the effect estimates by >10%.

We examined the association between antioxidants and ovarian
cancer across strata of smoking (never, former, or current). Tests of
statistical interaction were conducted by using Wald hypotheses tests
about the model regression coefﬁcients pertaining to the interaction,
resulting in a Wald statistic with asymptotic chi-square distribution. The
P values for the tests, with correct speciﬁcation, can be read from SAS
proc logistic Type 3 Analysis of Effects table and by specifying a
‘‘contrast’’ statement in proc logistic. We also conducted analyses
between serous and nonserous cases and tested for heterogeneity by
statistically comparing parameter estimates between corresponding
relative risk ratios in a multinomial regression model.

Results

As expected, established ovarian cancer risk factors differed
between cases and controls (Table 1). Cases were older and less
likely to have children, to use oral contraceptives, to have a
family history of breast or ovarian cancer, to consume alcohol,
or to have had a tubal ligation. Cases and controls had similar
intakes of total energy, protein, fat, and carbohydrates.

Median values of antioxidant intake were similar between
cases and controls (data not shown). Among the antioxidants
evaluated in this study, we only observed a statistically

signiﬁcant difference in median intake between cases and
controls for selenium from dietary supplements (2.86 mg/d for
cases compared with 5.71 mg/d for controls; P = 0.031). In
multivariable models, women who reported the highest intakes
of total selenium had an ;30% lower risk of ovarian cancer
than those with the lowest intakes (Table 2). Similar associations
were observed for both dietary and supplemental selenium,
although statistical signiﬁcance was reached only for supple-
mental intake. The inverse associations with selenium intake
were generally stronger in smokers (Supplemental Table 1).
In additional analyses (data not shown), we did not observe
effect modiﬁcation of
the association between selenium
supplements and ovarian cancer over strata of dietary selenium
intake (P = 0.44). There was also no association of dietary or
supplemental zinc or copper intake with ovarian cancer.

Weak inverse associations of ovarian cancer risk with in-
takes of carotenoids were not signiﬁcant (P = 0.07–0.60)
(Table 3). Ovarian cancer risk was positively associated
with b-cryptoxanthine (P = 0.03) (Table 3), but was not
associated with vitamin C or E intake (Table 4). We did not
observe appreciable differences in the results when we compared
serous with nonserous tumors (data not shown).

Discussion

In this population-based ovarian cancer study of African-American
women, compared with women with selenium intake in the lowest
quartile, those with intake in the highest quartile had an ~30% lower
risk of ovarian cancer; risk estimates were statistically signiﬁcant for
supplemental selenium but not for dietary (P = 0.1) or total selenium
(P = 0.1). Although we observed an inverse trend with increasing
intake of total carotenoids, statistical signiﬁcance was lacking. We
observed no association with either vitamin C or vitamin E. We
observed no appreciable differences in results between serous and
nonserous tumors, the 2 major histological types of ovarian
carcinoma.

An imbalance between free radicals (reactive oxygen species) and
antioxidants results in oxidative stress, which plays a role in ovarian
cancer pathogenesis by causing structural alterations in DNA directly
or indirectly through the formation of genotoxic lipid peroxidation
byproducts that react with DNA (3). Animal and human experi-
mental studies have shown that surface ovarian epithelial cells
contain elevated concentrations of 8-oxoguanine during ovulation,
which is an important mutagenic lesion in DNA (13). It has
therefore been suggested that limiting oxidative stress to the
ovarian epithelium could be considered a ﬁrst-line defense
against ovarian cancer.

The anticarcinogenic effects of selenium in a wide variety of
animal models prompted several decades of epidemiologic
studies of cancer in humans with mixed results (14). Regarding
ovarian cancer speciﬁcally, results have also been mixed.
Epidemiologic studies of selenium from food and supplements
(15–18), serum (19, 20), hair (21), and toenails (14) have shown
both null and inverse associations. We discerned no clear pattern
among those studies that might reconcile the disparate ﬁndings
based on methodologic or study design features.

The biological mechanisms underlying the multiple pathways
through which selenium may inﬂuence cancer development
remain unclear. Recently hypothesized mechanisms include a
chemopreventive action of speciﬁc selenoproteins in normal cells
that, conversely, take on a promoting role in existing neoplasms
(22). Whether such a dual action may help explain mixed ﬁndings
in the epidemiological literature is also unclear. Unlike our study,
most of the previous studies that examined selenium intake in
relation to ovarian cancer risk found no association with
supplemental selenium intake (15, 17, 18, 23), and one found
a positive association (16). Selenium from foods was examined
separately in only one study (16) and showed a statistically

signiﬁcant inverse association between dietary selenium intake
and ovarian cancer risk. As the authors of that study noted,
however, selenium concentrations in soil vary greatly by location.
Therefore, nutrient composition databases may inconsistently
reﬂect the actual intake of selenium from food.

The inverse association we observed was stronger than in
previous studies of white women, which may be caused by
higher levels of nutrient deﬁciency and/or oxidative stress in
African Americans (4, 5) and lower antioxidant intakes (6, 9).
These conditions may result in more African-American women
with suboptimal levels or outright deﬁciency. In our data, the
inverse association with supplemental selenium intake was not
modiﬁed by dietary intake, suggesting that ameliorating deﬁ-
ciency is not the primary mechanism.

Regarding deﬁciency,

the results of several well-known
clinical trials of antioxidant supplements did not show reduc-
tions in the risk of any cancer (24–26), although reductions in
overall cancer rates were observed in a trial conducted in a
nutritionally deﬁcient population (27). In a study in Linxian
Province (China), both serum selenium (28) and serum vitamin
E (a-tocopherol) (29) were inversely associated with cancer risk.
The possibility that inverse associations with antioxidants tend
to be stronger in (or limited to) individuals with high levels of
oxidative stress is supported by the stronger inverse associations
we observed in smokers. However, we cannot exclude the
possibility that our results were inﬂuenced by uncontrolled (or
residual) confounding from lifestyle factors or by any of the
other methodological limitations noted above.

Carotenoids are lipid-soluble, yellow-orange-red pigments
found in all higher plants and some animals. Proposed chemo-
preventive mechanisms include antioxidant, anti-inﬂammation,
antiangionesesis, antiproliferation, apoptosis
induction,
immune modulation, modulation of phase I and II enzymes,
induction of cell differentiation, enhancement of gap junction
communication, and others (30). The association between
carotenoids and ovarian cancer risk is currently unclear in
epidemiologic studies. Although study results have been mixed,
prospective cohort studies have largely shown no association
with the major carotenoids (17, 19, 31–33) or speciﬁcally with
b-carotene (34, 35). Among the case-control studies that exam-
ined speciﬁc carotenoids, results have not been consistent regard-
ing which showed statistically signiﬁcant inverse associations (2,
15, 16, 36–44). Six of the latter studies showed inverse associa-
tions with leutin and zeaxanthin (2, 32, 36, 40, 42, 43), whereas 2
studies showed no association (15, 16). Case-control studies that
examined summary measures of total carotenoids (36, 38, 41, 42,
44) have tended to show statistically signiﬁcant inverse associa-
tions. However, none of the prospective cohort studies showed an
association with such summary measures. Although most of the
cohort studies were statistically underpowered, the results of a
pooled analysis of 10 cohort studies with ;2000 cases of
ovarian cancer (32) also found no association. A few studies
examined the association between carotenoids and ovarian
cancer by tumor subtype (15, 32, 37, 38) and more often found
stronger inverse associations for mucinous tumors (15, 32, 38).
Finally, we observed a positive trend for b-cryptoxanthin. A
similar positive association with b-cryptoxanthin was found in
one previous study (15). The authors of that study noted (p. 673)
that as an oxycarotenoid or xanthophylls (C-OH),
is
biologically plausible that b-cryptoxanthin may act on ovar-
ian cells differently from other hydrocarbon carotenoids (C-H).
Vitamin E is an important lipid-soluble antioxidant, and
animal and human studies have shown that it may prevent the
formation of lipid peroxides, which have been observed to

it

induce oxidant damage of DNA (18). The prospective studies of
dietary and supplemental vitamin E and ovarian cancer risk have
shown mostly null results (17, 32–35, 45). The results of case-
control studies are more mixed with some showing null (15, 16,
23, 34, 38) and others showing inverse associations (18, 36, 37,
42, 44). One case-control study found an inverse association
with supplemental vitamin E intake that was not observed with
dietary vitamin E (23). Overall, the results for vitamin E supple-
ments have been as inconsistent as those for diet (15–18, 23, 33). To
date, the number of studies that considered ovarian cancer subtype
is too small to discern any related patterns in ﬁndings.

The results of studies of vitamin C intake from diet or
supplements have been mostly null (15–18, 32–36, 38, 41, 45,
46), but a few studies have found inverse associations with
supplemental (23) or total vitamin C intake (42, 44). There also
have been some reports of higher risk of ovarian cancer in
women who reported taking vitamin C supplements (17, 34),
although the majority of studies have shown neither a positive
nor an inverse association with risk.

The reasons for the inconsistent ﬁndings with antioxidants
across studies are unclear. One possibility is that this inconsis-
tency reﬂects the lack of a genuine association. Alternatively,
there may be a true association, but the equivocal evidence
reﬂects methodological challenges in addressing this question.
Examples of such methodological
issues include the limited
validity and reliability of some dietary measures, food preparation
methods that are not adequately captured in the FFQ, unquanti-
ﬁed confounding, synergy with genetic and epigenetic factors, and
the fact that different populations can have different burdens of
oxidative stress and, therefore, antioxidant intake may be most
valuable in subgroups of the population with the highest oxidative
stress (3, 47). Future research that rigorously addresses these
methodological shortcomings is needed to move this ﬁeld forward.
A unique strength of our study is that we could recruit a large
sample of African-American women with ovarian cancer and
population-based controls from various geographic regions with
diverse socioeconomic and lifestyle characteristics, which in-
creases our ability to generalize our results to the larger African-
American population. Hence, our study adds to the scarce
literature on the etiology of ovarian cancer in African-American
women. There are also several limitations to our study. Residual
confounding is possible despite the multivariable and mutually
adjusted models. We also recognize the limitations of dietary
recall and selection bias in case-control studies. We did not
obtain circulating levels of the studied antioxidants, which may
help reduce measurement error and potential bias toward the
null. Regarding selection bias, the distribution of risk factors between
cases and controls in our study was in the expected directions
compared with other studies among African-American women (48),
which increased our conﬁdence in the validity of our ﬁndings.

In conclusion, our data suggest that higher intake of supple-
mental selenium may be inversely associated with risk of ovarian
cancer in African-American women. Additional studies are
needed to assess dietary associations with ovarian cancer in
African-American women, speciﬁcally those that include antioxi-
dants and other nutrients that may be lacking in this population.
