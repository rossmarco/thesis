Abstract: Epidemiological studies suggest that high intake
of dietary fat is a risk factor for the development of clinical
prostate cancer. Soy protein has also been proposed to play
a role in the prevention of prostate cancer, and one of the
isoflavones in soy protein, genistein, inhibits the growth of
human prostate cancer cell lines in vitro. This study was de-
signed to evaluate whether altering dietary fat, soy protein,
and isoflavone content affects the growth rate of a human
androgen-sensitive prostate cancer cell line (LNCaP) grown
in severe-combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice. SCID
mice were randomized into four dietary groups: high-fat
(42.0 kcal%) + casein, high-fat (42.0 kcal%) + soy protein +
isoflavone extract, low-fat (12.0 kcal%) + casein, and low-fat
(12.0 kcal%) + soy protein + isoflavone extract. After two
weeks on these diets, the mice were injected subcutaneously
with 1 ´ 105 LNCaP tumor cells and placed in separate cages
(1 mouse/cage) to strictly control caloric intake. Isocaloric di-
ets were given 3 days/wk, and tumor sizes were measured once
per week. The tumor growth rates were slightly reduced in the
group that received the low-fat + soy protein + isoflavone ex-
tract diet compared with the other groups combined (p <
0.05). In addition, the final tumor weights were reduced by
15% in the group that received the low-fat + soy protein +
isoflavone extract diet compared with the other groups com-
bined (p < 0.05). In this xenograft model for prostate cancer,
there were statistically significant effects on tumor growth
rate and final tumor weight attributable to a low-fat + soy
protein + isoflavone extract diet.

Introduction

In the United States, prostate cancer is the most com-
monly diagnosed cancer in men as well as the second lead-
ing cause of male cancer-related deaths (1). It is estimated
that in 1999 there will be 179,300 new prostate cancer cases
and 37,000 men will die from the disease (1). Although la-
tent or clinically insignificant prostate cancer occurs in a

large proportion and at equal rates in autopsy studies among
men of Asian countries and the United States (approx 30%
of men >50 yr old), the incidence of clinically significant
prostate cancer is 15-fold higher in the United States (1–4).
Furthermore, Chinese and Japanese men who immigrate to
this country have an increased incidence and mortality from
prostate cancer compared with Chinese and Japanese men in
their native country (5–8). These epidemiological studies
suggest that environmental factors associated with Western
culture may promote the development of clinical prostate
cancer. Two such dietary factors that have been implicated
are dietary fat and soy protein. A number of epidemiological
studies have shown a positive association between intake of
dietary fat and the incidence and mortality from prostate
cancer (8–12). Furthermore, a recent study by Wang and
co-workers (13) showed that androgen receptor-positive hu-
man prostate cancer cells (LNCaP) had greater tumor
weights and growth rates in nude mice fed a diet high in
polyunsaturated fat (40.5 kcal%) than in mice fed diets
lower in fat content (21.2, 11.6, and 2.3 kcal%) (13).

One of the major differences between Asian and Ameri-
can diets is the consumption of soy-based foodstuffs. Cow-
ard and colleagues (14) reported the average consumption of
soy protein in Taiwan to be 35 g/day per capita (14). The
beneficial effects of soy have been attributed to the iso-
flavones found in highest content in soy, e.g., genistein and
daidzein (15,16). Genistein and daidzein, and their
b-glucoside conjugates, are present in soybeans in concen-
trations of up to 3 mg/g, and the average isoflavone intake in
the Asian culture is estimated to be 39 mg/day (17,18). The
average American eats, at most, a few milligrams of
isoflavones per day (15). The decrease in prostate cancer
mortality in Japanese men compared with those in the
United States may be attributed, in part, to the high soy pro-
tein content in the Japanese diet (16). Whereas a number of
investigators have shown that genistein inhibits the growth
of human prostate cancer cell lines in vitro, no experiments

have evaluated the effect of soy protein and isoflavones on
the growth of human prostate cancer in vivo. This study was
specifically designed to evaluate whether altering dietary
fat, soy protein, and isoflavone content affects the implanta-
tion rate and growth rate of a human androgen-sensitive
prostate cancer cell line (LNCaP) grown in severe-combined
immunodeficient (SCID) mice.

Methods

Cells and Reagents

The androgen receptor-positive LNCaP cell line was ob-
tained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rock-
ville, MD). The LNCaP cells were grown in RPMI 1640
medium supplemented with L-glutamine, 10% fetal bovine
serum (Omega Scientific, Tarzana, CA), and penicillin-
streptomycin in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and air at 37°C.

Animals

Sixty-six male CB17 beige SCID mice (8 wk old) were ob-
tained from the Department of Laboratory Animal Medicine
Facility at the University of California, Los Angeles, which is
accredited by the American Association for Accreditation of
Laboratory Animal Care. The mice were initially housed five
per cage for two weeks while they received their respective
diets, then, after tumor inoculation, mice were housed one per
cage. The cages were kept in a sterile and pathogen-free envi-
ronment. Cages, bedding, and water were autoclaved before
use. The feeding receptacles were in the top of the cages, so
caloric intake could be monitored and new feedings given
without the cage being opened. Strict sterile technique was

used whenever the cages, mice, and feed were handled. Ap-
proval for the experiments was obtained from the University
of California, Los Angeles, Chancellor’s Animal Research
Committee, and all animals were cared for in accordance with
the Institutional Guidelines.

Diets

The ingredients of the four experimental diets (prepared
by Dyets, Bethlehem, PA) are listed in Table 1. Corn oil was
used as the source of fat, and the fat calories from corn oil
were balanced with carbohydrate calories from cornstarch.
The protein source was soy protein isolate (Supro 670 HG,
donated by Protein Technologies International, St. Louis,
MO) or casein. The soy protein isolate (Supro 670 HG) con-
tains the following isoflavones: 0.078% conjugated geni-
stein, 0.107% unconjugated genistein, 0.037% conjugated
daidzein, 0.052% unconjugated daidzein, 0.006% conju-
gated glycitein, and 0.009% unconjugated glycitein by
weight. The soy isoflavone extract (PTI-G2535, donated by
Protein Technologies International, St. Louis, MO) contains
the following unconjugated isoflavones: 43.7% genistein,
21.8% daidzein, and 3.4% glycitein by weight. The total of
isoflavones in each soy protein-containing diet was 0.18%
by weight. The diets were radiated to obtain sterility. During
the experiments, the diets were stored at 5°C.

Feeding Protocol

After tumor injection, mice were housed one mouse per
cage to allow us to give the mice specific quantities of food
and to accurately measure the caloric intake of the mice dur-
ing the experiment. Three times a week the mice were given

fresh food. Each time the mice received fresh food, the calo-
ric intake from the prior feeding period was determined.
This was done by subtracting the amount of feed remaining
in the feeding receptacle from the amount available to each
mouse at the beginning of each feeding period. The average
caloric intake (from the prior feeding period) of all the mice
was calculated, and this amount was given to each mouse for
the subsequent feeding period. With this protocol, caloric in-
take was reduced for the mice with the highest intakes, while
mice with lower caloric intakes were given the opportunity
to increase their caloric consumption. This technique pro-
vided approximately equal caloric intake for all four groups
of mice (see Results).

Design of Experiments

LNCaP cells were harvested from subconfluent cultures
after incubation for one minute with 0.25% trypsin and
0.02% EDTA. After suspension in RPMI 1640 medium sup-
plemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, the live cells were
stained with trypan blue dye and counted manually with a
microscope and hemocytometer. The LNCaP cells were re-
suspended in ice-cold Matrigel (Collaborative Biomedical
Products, Bedford, MA) at a final concentration of 1 ´ 105
cells/0.2 ml Matrigel. Each mouse was given a subcutaneous
inoculation of 1 ´ 105 tumor cells in the lateral abdomen
with a disposable syringe and a 26-gauge needle. An initial
experiment with 20 animals (5 in each dietary group) was
performed by injecting 1 ´ 106 tumor cells in 0.2 ml of
Matrigel per animal. When the tumors in these animals
reached 1.0–1.5 cm3, they caused the animals in all four di-
etary groups to become cachectic. This occurred in all ani-
mals at approximately seven weeks after tumor inoculation.
Therefore, 1 ´ 105 cells in 0.2 ml of Matrigel were used for
subsequent experiments to allow tumor growth over a longer
time period to evaluate the effect of the diets.

Two successive experiments were performed: the first
with five animals in each of the four dietary groups and the
second with six or seven animals in each of the four dietary
groups. The experiments were run separately because of
limited space and resources in our SCID mouse facility to
accommodate our one mouse per cage experimental design.
The data from both experiments were used for the statistical
analysis. All animals were randomly assigned to one of the
four dietary groups (high-fat + casein, high-fat + soy protein
+ isoflavones, low-fat + casein, or low-fat + soy protein +
isoflavones) and maintained on this diet for two weeks be-
fore tumor cell injection. All animals were kept on an
isocaloric diet, as described in Feeding Protocol. Once the
tumors became palpable, the dimensions were recorded
weekly through Week 12 of the experiment. Animal weights
were also recorded weekly. The tumor volumes were calcu-
lated using the following formula: length ´ width ´ height ´
0.5236 (20). Thirteen weeks after the initiation of the experi-
ment, all mice were sacrificed. Blood was collected and cen-
trifuged, and the serum was frozen at -70°C. The tumors
were dissected, weighed, and frozen in liquid nitrogen.

Determination of Serum Prostate-Specific Antigen and
Testosterone

Serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels were deter-
mined using an enzyme immunoassay kit (American Qualex
Antibodies, San Clemente, CA). Total serum testosterone
was determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays
(KMI Diagnostics, Minneapolis, MN). All the above assays
were performed in duplicate. The interassay variability was
<5.0%.

Statistical Analysis

A linear regression model was used to test the differences
of body weight, caloric intake, final tumor weight, PSA lev-
els, and testosterone levels among the four diet groups. Be-
cause this study consisted of two successive experiments,
“experiment” was also considered a covariate and, together
with baseline body weight and average weekly caloric in-
take, was included in the linear regression model. Baseline
body weight and average weekly caloric intake did not show
any significant association with tumor weight and PSA and
testosterone levels. Therefore, “experiment” was the only
covariate included in the final model. Growth rate was as-
sessed by repeatedly measuring tumor volumes over time. A
random coefficient model was developed to correlate tumor
volume, time (week), diet, and other covariates (experiment
and baseline body weight). Covariates that did not show sig-
nificant association with tumor volume were excluded from
the model. Log-rank test was used to test the time to palpa-
ble tumor among the four diet groups. The above analyses
were also carried out comparing each individual dietary
group with the other three dietary groups combined.

Results

Forty-three (94%) of the 46 mice developed measurable
tumors: 10 (10/12) in the high-fat + casein group, 11 (11/11)
in the high-fat + soy protein + isoflavone group, 12 (12/12)
in the low-fat + casein group, and 10 (10/11) in the low-fat +
soy protein + isoflavone group. There was no significant dif-
ference in caloric intake among the animals in the four
groups (Figure 1). In addition, there was no significant dif-
ference in the body weights among the groups (Figure 2).
When the final tumor weight and tumor growth rate were
compared among the four dietary groups, there were no sig-
nificant differences. However, the final tumor weights in
mice fed the low-fat + soy protein + isoflavone diet were
15% less than the final tumor weights of the animals in the
other three groups combined (high-fat + casein, high-fat +
soy protein + isoflavone, and low-fat + casein) ( p = 0.0499,
general linear model) (Table 2). In addition, the growth rate
of the tumors in the mice fed the low-fat diet combined with
soy protein and isoflavones was lower than that in the other
three groups combined (Figure 3) ( p = 0.0382, mixed
model). There was no difference among the four groups in

one levels at 13 weeks were 70% lower in mice fed the
low-fat + soy protein + isoflavone diet than in the other
groups, but this was not statistically significant (Table 3).
There was no difference in PSA levels between the four
groups at the termination of the experiment (Table 3).

Discussion

In this study, we evaluated the effect of dietary fat, soy
protein, and soy isoflavones on the growth of human pros-
tate cancer cells in a xenograft SCID mouse model. We
found that combining a low-fat diet (12 kcal%) with soy pro-
tein (20 kcal%) and isoflavones (0.18% by weight) reduced
the tumor growth rate and the final tumor weights compared
with the other diets in our study.

In a prior study, Wang and co-workers (13) showed a sig-
nificant reduction in the growth of LNCaP tumors in nude
mice fed diets lower in fat (21.2, 11.6, and 2.3 kcal%) com-
pared with mice fed a high-fat diet (40.5 kcal%). In our
study, there was a trend toward decreased tumor weights in
the low-fat + casein group compared with the high-fat + ca-
sein group, although this did not reach statistical signifi-
cance. It may be that, with a larger sample size, this
difference between the low-fat and high-fat groups may
have reached statistical significance. An alternative explana-
tion for the differences in the results of our study and those
of Wang and co-workers may be explained by differences in
the experimental designs. In our study, the one animal per
cage design allowed for an isocaloric feeding protocol. In
the study by Wang and co-workers, there were multiple ani-
mals per cage, and therefore caloric intake was not strictly
controlled or monitored. It is possible that the marked differ-

ence between the low-fat and high-fat groups observed by
Wang and co-workers may be due to a difference in caloric
intake, since higher energy intake may lead to increased tu-
mor growth (21). An alternative explanation may relate to
the animal model that we used. Whereas nude mice (used by
Wang and co-workers) possess B cell immunity, SCID mice
lack T cell, B cell, and natural killer cell immunity. It may be
that nutrition is interacting with the immune system in the
nude mouse to cause more dramatic differences in tumor
size.

The role of soy protein and isoflavones in the prevention
and treatment of prostate cancer remains largely undefined
and is actively being studied at a number of centers. Re-
search has focused on the isoflavone genistein and its effects
on prostate cancer cell lines. Genistein has been shown to in-
hibit the growth of human prostate cancer cell lines in tissue
culture and in histoculture (22,23). In addition, genistein
also inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis of prostate
cancer cell lines (24). Soy protein also contains noniso-
flavone substances with anticancer properties (Bowman-
Burke inhibitor), which may also be responsible for the
growth-inhibitory effect seen in the present study (25).

In this study, altering the fat, soy, and isoflavone content
had no effect on the PSA levels. PSA is a well-known
marker for prostate cancer progression that correlates with
tumor growth and metastases (26). Because the low-fat diet
high in soy protein and isoflavone caused only a 15% reduc-
tion in the final tumor weight in this experiment, this effect
may not be large enough to cause a significant change in the
serum PSA level. Alternatively, the diet may have inhibited
the growth of a population of the tumor cells that do not pro-
duce PSA. In the present study, the mice fed the low-fat diet
high in soy protein and isoflavones had a 70% decrease in
total testosterone levels, although this did not reach statisti-
cal significance. Wang and co-workers (13) also found that
low-fat diets failed to reduce serum testosterone levels. Al-
though several studies found a correlation between low-fat
diets and circulating androgen levels, further investigation is
required in this area (27,28). Low-fat diets may cause a re-
duction in bioavailable testosterone (free testosterone) levels
by increasing sex hormone-binding globulin levels, although
further investigations are needed in this area as well (29).
In conclusion, in this xenograft model for prostate cancer,
there were statistically significant effects on tumor growth
rate and final tumor weight attributable to a low-fat diet
combined with soy protein and isoflavones.
