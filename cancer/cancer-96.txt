Abstract
Objective To investigate the association between intake of dietary fibre
and whole grains and risk of colorectal cancer.
Design Systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective
observational studies.
Data sources PubMed and several other databases up to December
2010 and the reference lists of studies included in the analysis as well
as those listed in published meta-analyses.
Study selection Prospective cohort and nested case-control studies of
dietary fibre or whole grain intake and incidence of colorectal cancer.
Results 25 prospective studies were included in the analysis. The
summary relative risk of developing colorectal cancer for 10 g daily of
total dietary fibre (16 studies) was 0.90 (95% confidence interval 0.86
to 0.94, I2=0%), for fruit fibre (n=9) was 0.93 (0.82 to 1.05, I2=23%), for
vegetable fibre (n=9) was 0.98 (0.91 to 1.06, I2=0%), for legume fibre
(n=4) was 0.62 (0.27 to 1.42, I2=58%), and for cereal fibre (n=8) was
0.90 (0.83 to 0.97, I2=0%). The summary relative risk for an increment
of three servings daily of whole grains (n=6) was 0.83 (0.78 to 0.89,
I2=18%).
Conclusion A high intake of dietary fibre, in particular cereal fibre and
whole grains, was associated with a reduced risk of colorectal cancer.
Further studies should report more detailed results, including those for
subtypes of fibre and be stratified by other risk factors to rule out residual
confounding. Further assessment of the impact of measurement errors
on the risk estimates is also warranted.

Introduction
Colorectal cancer is the third most common type of cancer, with
1.2 million new cases diagnosed in 2008 worldwide, accounting
for about 9.7% of all cases of cancer.1 Evidence from ecological
studies, migrant studies, and secular trend studies suggest that
environmental risk factors are of major importance in the cause
of colorectal cancer.2-4 Dietary factors have been suspected as
important, but only intakes of red and processed meat and
alcohol are considered to be convincing dietary risk factors for
colorectal cancer.5
In the 1970s, Burkitt proposed the hypothesis that dietary fibre
reduces the risk of colorectal cancer, based on the observation
of low rates of such cancer among rural Africans who ate a diet
with a high fibre content.6 Several plausible mechanisms have
been proposed to explain the hypothesis, including increased
stool bulk and dilution of carcinogens in the colonic lumen,
reduced transit time, and bacterial fermentation of fibre to short
chain fatty acids.7 However, although many epidemiological
studies have investigated the association between fibre intake
and risk of colorectal cancer, the results have not been consistent
and the possibility of residual confounding by folate intake
remains a controversial issue.8 Case-control studies have
generally shown a protective association,9 10 whereas the results
from cohort studies have been mixed.8 11-31 In addition, it is not
clear whether only specific types or sources of fibre are
associated with the risk. Although initial cohort studies generally
reported no significant association between fibre intake and risk
of colorectal cancer, the hypothesis regained interest when the

European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition
(EPIC) study reported a linear decrease in the risk of colorectal
cancer with increasing fibre intake.19 A subsequent pooled
analysis of 13 North American and European cohort studies
(not including the EPIC study) reported an 18% increased risk
of colorectal cancer with low fibre intake (<10 g/day v 10-15
g/day), but no further reductions in risk were observed with
higher intake.31 More recently, results from additional large
cohort studies23-30 have been published and, together with the
EPIC study, included more than 1.7 million participants and 12
000 cases and included several studies from Asian
populations.23 24 26 30 With such a large number of additional
studies we had sufficient statistical power to clarify the
dose-response relation between fibre intake and risk of colorectal
cancer. In addition we examined whether specific types of fibre
are associated with risk.
Whole grains are a major source of dietary fibre and contain
germ, endosperm, and bran, in contrast with refined grains that
contain only the endosperm. The germ and bran contain
numerous nutrients, which are removed during the refining
process. In addition, whole grains are a major source of several
vitamins, minerals, and phytochemicals, which have anticancer
properties and could plausibly influence the risk of colorectal
cancer by several potential mechanisms.32 An earlier review and
meta-analysis of case-control studies of whole grain intake and
colorectal cancer and polyps reported a summary odds ratio of
0.79 for the highest versus the lowest intake.33 However, the
interpretation of case-control studies is hampered by possible
recall and selection biases, which make it difficult to draw firm
conclusions. Over the past decade results from several cohort
studies have been published on whole grain intake and risk of
colorectal cancer, with mixed results.16 20 25 27 34-39 Some studies
suggested no association,16 20 34 36 whereas others reported an
inverse association with higher whole grain intake.25 27 35 37-39 To
clarify the association between dietary fibre and whole grain
intake and risk of colorectal cancer we carried out a systematic
review and meta-analysis of published prospective studies. We
also did meta-regression and sensitivity analyses to evaluate
potential sources of heterogeneity in the analyses.
Methods
Several reviewers at Wageningen University carried out the
literature search and extracted data up to December 2005. They
searched several databases, including PubMed, Embase, CAB
Abstracts, ISI Web of Science, BIOSIS, Latin American and
Caribbean Center on Health Sciences Information, Cochrane
library, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health
Literature, the Allied and Complementary Medicine Database,
National Research Register, and In Process Medline. As all the
relevant prospective studies were identified by the PubMed
searches the protocol was modified and only PubMed was used
for the updated searches from January 2006 to December 2010.
No language restrictions were imposed. This review was done
as part of the Continuous Update Project of the World Cancer
Research Fund and has been published online (www.wcrf.org/
PDFs/Colorectal-cancer-CUP-report-2010.pdf). A predefined
protocol was used for the review (www.dietandcancerreport.
org/downloads/SLR_Manual.pdf) and we followed standard
criteria for meta-analyses of observational studies.40 Abstracts,
grey literature, and unpublished results or information were not
included. We also searched the reference lists of the studies that
were included in our analysis as well as those listed in the
published meta-analyses.33 41

Study selection
To be included studies had to have a prospective cohort,
case-cohort, or nested case-control design and investigate the
association between dietary fibre or whole grain intake and
incidence of colorectal cancer. We excluded retrospective
case-control studies and cross sectional studies. The publication
had to include estimates of the relative risk (hazard ratio, risk
ratio) with the 95% confidence intervals. For the dose-response
analysis, a quantitative measure of intake and the total number
of cases and person years had to be provided. When several
publications were from the same study we selected the
publication with the largest number of cases. We identified 40
potentially relevant full text publications.8 11-30 34-39 42-54 We
excluded seven that reported mean exposure only,42-48 seven that
were duplicate publications,19 49-54 and one that was on mortality
from colorectal cancer.34 Two publications that were included
in the dietary fibre analyses reported on specific whole grain
foods, not overall intake, and we excluded these from the whole
grain analysis.16 20 For the dose-response analysis we further
excluded two publications that reported results only for the
highest versus the lowest levels of intake,30 37 and two
publications that did not report quantities of intake.11 15
Data extraction
From each study we extracted data on the first author’s last
name, year of publication, country where the study was done,
study name, follow-up period, sample size, sex, age, number of
cases, method of dietary assessment (type, number of food items,
and whether the assessment method had been validated),
exposure (by type of outcome), quantity of intake, relative risks
and 95% confidence intervals for the highest versus the lowest
intake, and variables adjusted for in the analysis. Several
reviewers at Wageningen University carried out the search and
extracted data of articles published up to December 2005 during
the systematic literature review for the World Cancer Research
Fund and Association for International Cancer Research report
(www.dietandcancerreport.org/downloads/SLR/Colon_and_
Rectum_SLR.pdf). Two of the authors (DSMC and RL) did the
search from January 2006 to December 2010. Three authors
(DSMC, RL, and DA) extracted the data into a database, and
two authors (TN and DA) checked these for accuracy.
Statistical analysis
We used random effects models to calculate summary relative
risks and 95% confidence intervals for the highest versus the
lowest levels of dietary fibre and whole grain intake and for the
dose-response analysis. The average of the natural logarithm of
the relative risks was estimated and we weighted the relative
risk from each study by the inverse of its variance. A two tailed
P<0.05 was considered statistically significant. For studies that
reported results separately for colon and rectal cancer or for
men and women separately, we combined the estimates using
a fixed effects model to obtain an overall estimate for colorectal
cancer or both sexes combined.
We used a previously described method55 for the dose-response
analysis and computed study specific slopes (linear trends) and
95% confidence intervals from the natural logs of the relative
risks and confidence intervals across categories of dietary fibre
and whole grain intake. The method requires that the distribution
of cases and person years or non-cases and the relative risks
with the variance estimates are known for at least three
quantitative categories of use. We estimated the distribution of
cases or person years in studies that did not report these but
reported the total number of cases or person years if the results

were analysed by quantiles (and could be approximated)—for
example, the total number of person years was divided by 5
when data were analysed by quintiles to derive the number of
person years in each fifth. We assigned the median or mean
level of dietary fibre or whole grain intake in each category to
the corresponding relative risk for each study. For studies that
reported the intake by ranges of intake we estimated the
midpoint in each category by calculating the average of the
lower and upper bound. When the highest category was open
ended we assumed the length of the open ended interval to be
the same as that of the adjacent interval. When the lowest
category was open ended we set the lower boundary to zero. If
the intakes were reported in densities (servings per 1000 kcal)
we recalculated the reported intakes to absolute intakes using
the mean or median energy intake.18 21 27 28 In studies that reported
the whole grain intake in grams daily we used 30 g as a serving
size for recalculation of the intakes to a common scale (servings
daily). The dose-response results in the forest plots are presented
for a 10 g daily increment for dietary fibre and for an increment
of three servings daily (90 g) for whole grains. We examined a
potential non-linear dose-response relation between dietary fibre
and whole grain intake and colorectal cancer by using fractional
polynomial models.56 We determined the best fitting second
order fractional polynomial regression model, defined as the
one with the lowest deviance. A likelihood ratio test was used
to assess the difference between the non-linear and linear models
to test for non-linearity.57
Heterogeneity between studies was assessed by the Q test and
I2 statistic.58 I2 is the amount of total variation that is explained
by variation between studies. We did not use a score to assess
study quality but in subgroup analyses we determined whether
indicators of study quality, such as study size, number of cases,
duration of follow-up, and adjustment for confounders modified
the results. Heterogeneity between subgroups was evaluated by
meta-regression.
Publication bias was assessed with Egger’s test59 and Begg’s
test,60 with the results considered to indicate publication bias
when P<0.10. In addition, we visually explored funnel plots for
asymmetry. We carried out sensitivity analyses excluding one
study at a time to explore whether the results were driven by
one large study or by a study with an extreme result.
Results
Dietary fibre
Twenty one prospective studies8 11-18 20-30 36 were identified and
included in the analysis of the highest versus the lowest intake
of dietary fibre and risk of colorectal cancer, 18 of
which8 12-14 16-18 20-29 36 were included in the dose-response analyses
(table 1⇓, fig 1⇓). Twelve of the studies were from the United
States, five from Europe, and four from Asia. Table 1
summarises the characteristics of the included studies. The
ranges of intake varied: 6.3-21.4 g/day for total dietary fibre,
1.8-15.5 g/day for fruit fibre, 1.9-16.8 g/day for vegetable fibre,
3.0-16.9 g/day for cereal fibre, and 1.3-3.8 g/day for legume
fibre (results not shown).
Total dietary fibre
High versus low intake
Nineteen prospective studies (18 publications) were included
in the analysis of high versus low intake of total dietary fibre
and risk of colorectal cancer (table 1).8 11 12 15-18 20-30 The summary
relative risk was 0.88 (95% confidence interval 0.82 to 0.94),

with no evidence of heterogeneity (I2=0%, P=0.48, see web
extra figure 1a).
Dose-response analysis
Sixteen prospective studies (15 publications)8 12 16-18 20-29 were
included in the dose-response analysis, with 14 514 cases among
1 985 552 participants. The summary relative risk was 0.90
(0.86 to 0.94) for each 10 g/day intake, with no significant
heterogeneity (I2=0%, P=0.48, fig 2⇓). A statistically significant
inverse association was seen for colon cancer8 12-14 21 23 24 26-29 36
(13 studies, summary relative risk 0.89, 0.81 to 0.97, I2=35%,
P=0.11) but not for rectal cancer8 12 21 23 24 26-29 (10 studies, 0.91,
0.83 to 1.03, I2=15%, P=0.31), although evidence was lacking
for heterogeneity between subsites (P=0.86, see table 3).
Publication bias was not evident with either Egger’s test
(P=0.62) or Begg’s test (P=0.56). In a sensitivity analysis
excluding one study at a time, the summary relative risk for
colorectal cancer ranged from 0.89 (0.85 to 0.93) when the
National Institutes of Health-American Association for Retired
Persons (NIH-AARP) Diet and Health Study was excluded to
0.91 (0.88 to 0.96) when the EPIC study was excluded. A
non-linear association was not evident between intake of total
dietary fibre and risk of colorectal cancer (P=0.32 for
non-linearity, fig 2).
Fruit fibre
High versus low intake
Nine cohort studies (eight publications)8 17 18 21 22 26-28 were
included in the analysis of high versus low intake of fruit fibre
and risk of colorectal cancer. The summary relative risk was
0.94 (0.85 to 1.04; see also web extra figure 2a), with little
evidence of heterogeneity (I2=39%, P=0.11).
Dose-response analysis
Nine cohort studies (eight publications)8 17 18 21 22 26-28 were
included in the dose-response analysis of fruit fibre and risk of
colorectal cancer, with 9930 cases among 1 514 871 participants.
The summary relative risk for each 10 g/day intake was 0.93
(0.82 to 1.05, fig 3⇓), with little evidence of heterogeneity
(I2=23%, P=0.24). Publication bias was not evident with Egger’s
test (P=0.83) or Begg’s test (P=0.47). The summary relative
risk ranged from 0.87 (0.78 to 0.96) when the NIH-AARP Diet
and Health Study was excluded to 0.95 (0.84 to 1.07) when the
Nurses’ Health Study was excluded.
Vegetable fibre
High versus low intake
Nine cohort studies (eight publications)8 17 18 21 22 26-28 were
included in the analysis of high versus low intake of vegetable
fibre and risk of colorectal cancer. The summary relative risk
was 0.98 (0.91 to 1.06, also see web extra figure 2b), with no
evidence of heterogeneity (I2=0%, P=0.48).
Dose-response analysis
Nine cohort studies (eight publications)8 17 18 21 22 26-28 were
included in the dose-response analysis of vegetable fibre and
risk of colorectal cancer, with 9930 cases among 1 514 871
participants. The summary relative risk for each 10 g/day intake
was 0.98 (0.91 to 1.06, fig 3), with no evidence of heterogeneity
(I2=0%, P=0.60). Publication bias was not evident with Egger’s
test (P=0.51) or Begg’s test (P=0.92). The summary relative
risk ranged from 0.96 (0.89 to 1.04) when the Nurses’ Health

Study was excluded to 1.02 (0.94 to 1.10) when the Multiethnic
Cohort Study was excluded.
Legume fibre
High versus low intake
Four cohort studies8 18 22 27 were included in the analysis of high
versus low intake of legume fibre and risk of colorectal cancer.
The summary relative risk was 0.89 (0.78 to 1.02, see also web
extra figure 2c), with moderate heterogeneity (I2=40.8%,
P=0.17).
Dose-response analysis
Four cohort studies8 18 22 27 were included in the dose-response
analysis of legume fibre intake and risk of colorectal cancer,
with 5405 cases among 1 095 056 participants. The summary
relative risk for each 10 g/day intake was 0.62 (0.27 to 1.42, fig
3), with moderate to high heterogeneity (I2=58%, P=0.07). The
summary relative risk ranged from 0.38 (0.08 to 1.87) when
excluding the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study to 0.84 (0.65
to 1.09) when excluding the Women’s Health Study.
Cereal fibre
High versus low intake
Eight cohort studies (seven publications)8 17 18 21 22 27 28 were
included in the analysis of high versus low intake of cereal fibre
and risk of colorectal cancer. The summary relative risk was
0.90 (0.83 to 0.96, also see web extra figure 2d), with no
significant heterogeneity (I2=0%, P=0.94).
Dose-response analysis
Eight cohort studies (seven publications)8 17 18 21 22 27 28 were
included in the dose-response analysis of cereal fibre and risk
of colorectal cancer, with 9487 cases among 1 471 756
participants. The summary relative risk for each 10 g/day intake
was 0.90 (0.83 to 0.97, fig 3), with no evidence of heterogeneity
(I2=0%, P=0.78). Publication bias was not evident with Egger’s
test (P=0.90) or Begg’s test (P=1.00). The summary relative
risk ranged from 0.85 (0.76 to 0.95) when the Multiethnic
Cohort Study was excluded to 0.93 (0.85 to 1.03) when the
NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study was excluded.
Whole grains
Seven cohort studies were included in the analysis of total whole
grain intake and risk of colorectal cancer (table 2⇓, fig
1⇓).25 27 35-39 Two studies were from Europe and the other five
from the United States (table 2). Total whole grains included
whole grain rye breads, whole grain breads, oatmeal, whole
grain cereals, high fibre cereals, brown rice, and porridge. The
range of whole grain intake varied from and 61-128 g/day
(results not shown).
High versus low intake
Four cohort studies25 27 35 38 were included in the analysis of high
versus low intake of whole grains and risk of colorectal cancer.
The summary relative risk was 0.79 (0.72 to 0.86), with no
evidence of heterogeneity (I2=0%, P=0.98, see web extra figure
1b). The results for colon and rectal cancer were similar:
summary relative risks 0.82 (0.72 to 0.92, I2=23%, P=0.27)27 35-38
and 0.80 (0.59 to 1.07, I2=58%, P=0.10).27 35 38 The results for
rectal cancer were, however, not statistically significant.

Dose-response analysis
Six studies (five publications)25 27 35 38 39 were included in the
dose-response analysis, with a total of 7941 cases among 774
806 participants. The summary relative risk for colorectal cancer
with an increment of three servings daily (90 g/day) of whole
grains was 0.83 (0.78 to 0.89, fig 4⇓), with no evidence of
heterogeneity (I2=18%, P=0.30). The summary relative risk for
colon cancer27 35 36 38 was 0.86 (0.79 to 0.94), with no evidence
of heterogeneity (I2=0%, P=0.42), and for rectal cancer27 35 38
was 0.80 (0.56 to 1.14), with substantial heterogeneity (I2=91%,
P<0.001, table 4). In a sensitivity analysis excluding one study
at a time, no particular study explained the results for colorectal
cancer; the summary relative risk ranged from 0.82 (0.77 to
0.88) when the Swedish Mammography Study was excluded to
0.86 (0.80 to 0.92) when the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study
was excluded. Publication bias was not evident with Egger’s
test (P=0.54) or Begg’s test (P=1.00), although the number of
studies was low. However, the funnel plots did not suggest
asymmetry. A non-linear association between whole grain intake
and risk of colorectal cancer was not indicated (P=0.26, fig 4).
Subgroup, sensitivity, and meta-regression
analyses
In subgroup analyses defined by sex, subsite, adjustment for
confounders, number of cases, duration of follow-up,
geographical location, and range of intake, total dietary fibre
intake was inversely associated with risk of colorectal cancer
in most subgroups, with no evidence of significant heterogeneity
between subgroups with meta-regression analyses (table 3⇓).
Similar results were observed for intake of cereal fibre and
whole grains (table 4⇓). Intake of fruit fibre was not significantly
associated with risk of colorectal cancer in most subgroup
analyses. In the subgroups of studies that adjusted for alcohol
intake and body mass index or weight, however, inverse
associations were significant, with evidence of heterogeneity
between subgroups (P=0.04, table 3). When stratified by the
range of intake, an inverse association was observed for intake
of fruit fibre in studies with a range of 10 g/day or more but not
among studies with a range of 10 g/day or less (P=0.04 for
heterogeneity), but evidence of a difference in the results for
the other fibre types was lacking when stratified by the range
of intake (tables 3 and 4). Intake of vegetable fibre consistently
was not associated with risk of colorectal cancer in subgroup
analyses (table 3⇓). Too few studies of legume fibre precluded
any meaningful subgroup analyses.
In addition, the effect on the results of excluding studies from
the dose-response analysis was explored. When the analysis of
high versus low intake was restricted to the studies that were
included in the dose-response analysis of total dietary fibre, the
summary relative risk was 0.86 (0.80 to 0.92, I2=0%, P=0.46
for heterogeneity), similar to the original analysis including all
studies.
The influence on the results of the method used to estimate total
fibre intake was assessed. For the eight studies17 21 22 24 26-28 using
the Association of Official Analytical Chemists method, the
summary relative risk was 0.91 (0.85 to 0.97, I2=13.3%, P=0.33
for heterogeneity), for the four studies8 16 21 using the Englyst
method it was 0.91 (0.81 to 1.02, I2=37.0%, P=0.19 for
heterogeneity), and for the six studies12 18 20 23 25 29 with an
unknown method it was 0.93 (0.86 to 1.00, I2=0%, P=0.89 for
heterogeneity). In this sensitivity analysis no heterogeneity was
found between subgroups (P=0.39 for heterogeneity). In
addition, in one study the results did not differ materially
between the two methods.21

Discussion
Our meta-analysis supports an inverse association between
intake of dietary fibre, cereal fibre, and whole grains and risk
of colorectal cancer, but we found no significant evidence for
an association with intake of fibre from fruit, vegetables, or
legumes.
Comparison with other studies
Our results for total dietary fibre are consistent with a previous
meta-analysis of case-control studies, which found an inverse
association between fibre intake and risk of colorectal cancer.
Our results, based on prospective studies, are not, however, as
strong as the previous results from case-control studies.9 The
size of the summary estimates from our analyses is more in line
with those of a pooled analysis of cohort studies,31 which found
an 18% increased risk among people with a low intake of dietary
fibre (<10 g/day). In that analysis, however, no further reduction
in risk occurred with higher intake of fibre, whereas we observed
a linear inverse association with increasing intake, such as shown
in the EPIC study.8 Several differences between our analysis
and the pooled analysis could explain the differences between
the results. For example, although some overlap occurs between
the studies included in the two analyses, some differences also
exist. Our dose-response analysis included results from
seven16-18 21 22 25 of the 13 studies in the Pooling Project of
Prospective Studies of Diet and Cancer, but included nine
additional studies8 12 20 23 24 26-29 not included in the pooled
analysis, some of which were large. Thus our analysis included
more than 14 000 cases among 1.9 million participants compared
with 8000 cases among 700 000 participants in the pooled
analysis. It is therefore possible that these additional studies
contributed to a better assessment of the dose-response relation
between fibre intake and risk of colorectal cancer. In line with
the pooled analysis we found no evidence for an association
between fruit or vegetable fibre and risk of colorectal cancer.
However, in a previous meta-analysis of prospective studies we
showed a reduction in risk with high intake of fruit and
vegetables,61 suggesting the potential role of components other
than fibre in fruits and vegetables in explaining this result. In
addition, we cannot exclude the possibility that the range of
fruit fibre intake was too low to detect an inverse association
in the overall analysis, although no difference in the summary
estimates was observed for the other fibre types when stratified
by the range of intake. Inverse associations were evident
between intakes of cereal fibre and whole grain and risk of
colorectal cancer in our analysis, and the results for whole grain
intake are consistent with a previous meta-analysis of
case-control studies, which reported a 20% reduction in risk
with high whole grain intake.33 The pooled analysis found a
marginally significant inverse association between whole grain
intake and colorectal cancer: pooled relative risk 0.92 (95%
confidence interval 0.84 to 1.00).31 In contrast to our results, the
Women’s Health Initiative Trial did not find a reduction in risk
of colorectal cancer among participants who were randomised
to an intervention with increased intakes of fruits, vegetables,
grains, and fibre and reductions in fat intake.62 However, fibre
intake increased by only 2.5 g/day from baseline to the three
year follow-up, from 15.4 to 17.9 g/day, whereas the intake in
the comparison group did not materially change (from 15.4 to
14.8 g/day). Thus the changes in fibre intake in that trial may
have been too small to significantly reduce the risk of colorectal
cancer. Given that our results show a 10% reduction in risk of
colorectal cancer for each 10 g intake of fibre daily, only a 2-3%
reduction in risk would be expected with such a small increase
in fibre intake.

Limitations of the study
Our meta-analysis has limitations that affect the interpretation
of the results. It is possible that the weak inverse associations
between dietary fibre or whole grain intake and risk of colorectal
cancer could result from unmeasured or residual confounding
by other dietary or lifestyle factors. Higher intakes of dietary
fibre and whole grain are typically associated with other health
behaviours, such as higher intakes of calcium and folate; higher
levels of physical activity; lower prevalence of smoking,
overweight, or obesity; and lower intakes of alcohol and red
and processed meat.22 27 63 Many but not all of the studies
adjusted for potential confounding factors, although not all
potential confounders were adjusted for in every study. In
analyses stratified by adjustment for confounding factors,
however, we found that the association between dietary fibre,
cereal fibre, and whole grains persisted in most subgroups, with
adjustment for potential confounding factors. In addition, in
meta-regression analyses evidence that the results for these
exposures differed significantly whether confounders had been
adjusted for or not was lacking. Only in the analysis of fruit
fibre was heterogeneity evident between studies that did or did
not adjust for body mass index or weight and alcohol intake,
with significant inverse associations among the studies with
such adjustments. None of the included studies reported results
stratified by alcohol, smoking, body mass index, or meat intake.
Any further studies should report analyses stratified by other
risk factors to better be able to rule out residual confounding.
Although publication bias can be a problem in meta-analyses
of published literature we found no evidence of such bias in this
analysis. In addition, the few studies that were excluded from
the dose-response analysis of dietary fibre are unlikely to have
altered the results because the results from the analyses of high
versus low intake were similar when we repeated the analyses
with the same dataset as in the dose-response analysis.
Accurate assessment of dietary fibre intake and other food
constituents is a challenge. The definition of dietary fibre may
differ between studies and may contribute to heterogeneity in
the results. Some studies used the Englyst definition of fibre,
which distinguishes non-starch polysaccharides from starch,
whereas other studies calculated fibre intake using the
Association of Official Analytical Chemists method, which
includes some starch as dietary fibre. The summary relative
risks were generally similar, however, no matter which method
was used, and there was no evidence of heterogeneity between
subgroups when stratified by the method used to calculate fibre
intake.
Most studies carried out to date have used food frequency
questionnaires to assess dietary intake. Concern is, however,
increasing that measurement errors associated with the use of
food frequency questionnaires may obscure associations between
dietary intake and risk of chronic disease.64 Few studies have
reported results corrected for measurement errors. In the EPIC
study the relative risk of colorectal cancer was 0.75 (95%
confidence interval 0.59 to 0.95) for the highest compared with
lowest fifths of fibre intake, and after calibration with more
detailed data the relative risk was 0.58 (0.41 to 0.85).19 In the
Pooling Project of Prospective Studies the adjusted relative risk
for less than 10 g/day compared with 10 g/day or more was 1.22
(1.10 to 1.35), but this increased to 2.16 (1.12 to 4.16) after
correction for measurement error.31 In a pooled analysis of seven
UK based cohort studies, a stronger association was observed
when food diaries were used to assess dietary fibre intake; an
odds ratio of 0.66 (95% confidence interval 0.45 to 0.96) for
the highest versus lowest fifths of fibre density compared with
0.88 (0.57 to 1.36) when food frequency questionnaires were

used to measure dietary intake.65 The latter was of similar size
to our summary estimate for the highest versus lowest intake
(summary relative risk 0.88, 95% confidence interval 0.82 to
0.94). The results using food diaries were further strengthened
when corrected for measurement errors: odds ratio 0.68 (95%
confidence interval 0.48 to 0.96) for a 0.7 g/MJ increase in fibre
intake (uncorrected odds ratio 0.83, 95% confidence interval
0.70 to 0.97).65 The results from these studies suggest that our
results for dietary fibre and risk of colorectal cancer are likely
to be conservative estimates of the true underlying risk and that
any further studies should incorporate correction for
measurement error in the analyses.
Strengths of the study
Our meta-analysis also has several strengths. Because we based
our analysis on prospective studies, our findings are unlikely
to be explained by recall bias and selection bias. Our
meta-analysis included a large number of studies and more than
14 500 cases, and almost two million participants in the dietary
fibre analysis. Thus we had adequate statistical power to clarify
the shape of the dose-response relation between dietary fibre
intake and risk of colorectal cancer and to detect moderate
reductions in risk. We also carried out sensitivity analyses to
investigate whether any particular study explained the results,
but the findings were generally robust. We quantified the
association between intake of dietary fibre and whole grain and
risk of colorectal cancer by carrying out linear and non-linear
dose-response analyses.
Mechanisms
A protective effect of dietary fibre and whole grain consumption
on risk of colorectal cancer is biologically plausible. Whole
grain foods are important sources of dietary fibre and may
decrease the risk of colorectal cancer by increasing stool bulk,
diluting faecal carcinogens, and decreasing transit time, thus
reducing the contact between carcinogens and the lining of the
colorectum.7 In addition, bacterial fermentation of fibre results
in the production of short chain fatty acids, which may have
protective effects against colorectal cancer.66 Other components
of whole grains may also protect against colorectal cancer,
including antioxidants, vitamins, trace minerals, phytate,
phenolic acids, lignans, and phytoestrogens.66-68 Whole grains
have a high content of folate and magnesium, which have been
associated with a reduced risk of colorectal cancer.69-71 Higher
intakes of dietary fibre and whole grain also protect against
weight gain72 73 and type 2 diabetes,74 75 and it is possible that
part of the potential effect of fibre intake is mediated through
improved weight control and reduced insulin resistance, although
these may not be the main mechanisms. However, the results
persisted in studies that adjusted for both folate and body mass
index, suggesting an association independent of folate and body
mass index.
Conclusions and policy implications
Our results indicate a 10% reduction in risk of colorectal cancer
for each 10 g/day intake of total dietary fibre and cereal fibre
and a about a 20% reduction for each three servings (90 g/day)
of whole grain daily, and further reductions with higher intake.
These findings thus have important public health implications.
Our results provide further support for public health
recommendations to increase the intake of dietary fibre in the
prevention of colorectal cancer. However, they suggest a
particular benefit of increasing cereal fibre and whole grain
intake. Increasing the intake of dietary fibre and whole grains

is also likely to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease,76-78
type 2 diabetes,74 75 overweight and obesity,72 73 and possibly
overall mortality,76 78 thus there are several health benefits by
increasing fibre intake and replacing refined grains with whole
grains.
In summary, our meta-analysis suggests that a high intake of
dietary fibre, particularly from cereal and whole grains, is
associated with a reduced risk of colorectal cancer. Further
studies should report more detailed results, including those for
subtypes of fibre, stratify the results by subsites within the
colorectum, and stratify the results by other risk factors to be
able to rule out residual confounding. Further assessment of the
impact of measurement errors on the risk estimates is also
warranted.

What is already known on this topic

Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer worldwide, with 1.2 million new cases annually
Intake of dietary fibre and whole grains has been established as protective against cardiovascular disease, but the association with
colorectal cancer is not convincing
It is unclear whether only specific types of fibre or sources of fibre are associated with the risk of colorectal cancer

What this study adds

Intakes of dietary fibre, cereal fibre, and whole grains are associated with linear decreases in the risk of colorectal cancer
Evidence of an association between intake of fruit, vegetable, or legume fibre and risk of colorectal cancer was lacking
Intake of dietary fibre, particularly cereal fibre and whole grains, was associated with a small reduction in the risk of colorectal cancer
