Abstract 
Accumulating  data  suggest  that  dietary  phytochemicals  have  the  potential  to  moderate 
deregulated  signalling  or  reinstate  checkpoint  pathways  and  apoptosis  in  damaged  cells, 
while  having  minimal  impact  on  healthy  cells.    These  are  ideal  characteristics  for 
chemopreventive  and  combination  anti-cancer  strategies,  warranting  substantial  research 
effort  into  harnessing  the  biological  activities  of  these  agents  in  disease  prevention  and 
treatment.  However, this requires further investigation into their mode of action and novel 
approaches to the development of reliable biomarkers. 
Introduction 
Epidemiology indicates that the incidence of many common cancers is geographically and 
environmentally determined and that diets rich in fresh fruit and vegetables confer a lower 
risk of developing tumours in many target tissues.   Around one third of all cancers are 
thought to be related to unhealthy diet and therefore, in theory, preventable [1]. However, 
linking particular dietary components to prevention of specific cancers has proved to be a 
major challenge.  
Many  phytochemicals  of  differing  chemical  structure  have  anticarcinogenic  properties. 
They  activate  cytoprotective  enzymes  and  inhibit  DNA  damage  to  block  initiation  in 
healthy cells, or modulate cell signalling to eliminate unhealthy cells at later stages in the 
carcinogenic process.  In vitro data for several well-studied compounds indicate that each 
can  affect  many  aspects  of  cell  biochemistry,  but  different  agents  have  many  similar 
activities (Table 1).  Nevertheless effects can be cell-type specific, with transformed cells 
being particularly sensitive.  But despite the exponential increase in knowledge regarding 
mechanisms of action of these molecules, their success in clinical trials has been limited.  
In addition to the difficulties of long-term prevention trials in healthy populations, there are 
other reasons for this.  In cancer therapeutics, emphasis is increasingly placed on targeting 
tumour subtypes within a particular tissue, but this has not generally been considered for 
chemopreventive trials.  In many instances the crucial in vivo targets for particular dietary 
molecules are unknown, making it difficult to predict which cancer phenotypes are most 
likely to be affected.  Many phytochemicals are poorly bioavailable and evidence suggests 
that combinations may be more effective than single agents.  There may also be advantages 
in  combining  them  with  chemo-  or  radio-therapies.    Probably  the  greatest  hindrance  to 
more  successful  trials  is  the  lack  of  validated  biomarkers  of  efficacy.    To  enable  many 
more agents to be tested much more quickly, validated surrogate endpoint biomarkers are

required, which will accurately determine outcome at a much earlier time in the process of 
tumour development.  
Identifying at risk individuals 
In order to optimise the chances of success in cancer chemoprevention trials, the ability to 
identify  those  individuals  most  likely  to  benefit  is  clearly  important  [2].    In  the  case  of 
primary  prevention  to  inhibit  the  earliest  stages  of  tumour  development,  selection  has 
traditionally  been  based  on  known  environmental  and  lifestyle  risk  factors,  genetic 
predisposition and family history.  But with such cohorts, obtaining definitive evidence to 
directly link exposure to a particular dietary agent with prevention of cancer in any target 
tissue is at best extremely challenging, at worst impossible.  In future it is possible that 
individuals suitable for primary prevention will be identified through screening for more 
common multiple susceptibility loci, such as those recently reported for breast cancer [3].   
Such loci together could inform on a substantial fraction of the genetic variance in some 
cancers. 
Patients can be recruited at later stages of the carcinogenic process.  Secondary prevention 
is  appropriate  for  those  who  have  already  developed  premalignant  lesions,  such  as 
intraepithelial  neoplasia  or  intestinal  polyps,  the  progress  of  which  can  be  monitored  in 
response  to  chemopreventive  treatments.    Several  dietary  compounds,  including  indoles 
and  polyphenols  have  shown  promise  in  this  respect,  with  regression  of  respiratory 
papillomatosis, cervical, vulvar and prostate intraepithelial neoplasia and oral leukoplakia 
[4-7].    However,  the  relationship  of  some  of  these  early  lesions  to  tumour  outcome  is 
uncertain.    Clearly  a  strategy  involving  susceptibility  loci  would  also  be  relevant  at  this 
stage, adding a degree of certainty to the prognosis. 
A  third  strategy  is  tertiary  prevention,  which  focuses  on  patients  who  have  been 
successfully  treated  for  a  primary  tumour,  in  order  to  inhibit  development  of  second 
primary tumours.  Greatest success to date in this respect has resulted from the use of drugs 
such as tamoxifen and its analogues for breast cancer, and retinoids for skin, head and neck 
and liver cancer [8].  If phytochemicals have a role at this stage, it is most likely to be as 
part of a combined therapy. 
Arguably a fourth category of patients who could benefit would be those with a superficial 
or  primary  tumour,  where  intervention  is  designed  to  prevent  invasion  and  metastases.  
While the cellular process of epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) is fundamental to 
morphogenesis,  when  reactivated  in  cancer,  it  facilitates  invasion  and  metastasis[9].  
Reversing this process could limit metastatic spread, achieving late-stage prevention with

enhanced survival. Ability of chemopreventive agents to inhibit EMT or angiogenesis has 
been demonstrated in a number of animal models.  Use of phytochemicals for this purpose 
would be facilitated by knowledge of the characteristics within the primary tumour which 
predict invasive potential.  We previously showed that the polyphenol, curcumin, modifies 
the invasive potential of breast cancer cells[10].   Another polyphenol, epigallocatechin-3-
gallate  (EGCG),  was  found  to  inhibit  neovascularisation  in  the  chick  chorioallantoic 
membrane assay and when given in drinking water could significantly suppress vascular 
endothelial  growth  factor  (VEGF)-induced  corneal  neovascularisation  [11].  Such  results 
suggest  that  EGCG  may  be  a  useful  inhibitor  of  angiogenesis  in  vivo.    A  number  of 
phytochemicals also affect expression of cadherins, catenins and matrix metalloproteinases 
(Table  1),  and  prognostic  metastatic  biomarkers  for  breast  cancer,  such  as  urokinase 
plasminogen  activator,  uPA/PAI1  and  Her2  [12]  all  of  which  can  modulate  invasive 
capacity.     
Tumour subtypes 
A  key  aspect  of  targeted  therapies,  which  has  so  far  received  much  less  attention  in 
chemoprevention trials, is the concept of tumour subtypes.  Tumour development involves 
the accumulation of multiple mutations which differ from one tumour to the next in the 
same target tissue.  Such changes can be assessed using gene expression profiles to identify 
patterns of pathway deregulation which inform on disease prognosis and indicate treatment 
options [13].  Subtypes are perhaps best defined for the leukaemias [reviewed in 14] and in 
breast cancer, where at least 5 subtypes including luminal A (oestrogen receptor α (ERα)-
positive),  luminal  B  (ERα-positive),  basal-like  (ERα-negative,  Her2-negative,  cytokeratin  5/6-positive, 
and/or epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)/Her1-positive), Her2 (Her2 amplicon-positive, 
ER-negative) and normal breast-like have been identified [15,16]. Such patterns in cancer cell 
lines have also been shown to be useful in predicting response to therapeutic agents [13, 
17,18].    However,  subtypes  identified  on  the  basis  of  gene  expression  profiles  do  not 
correspond  exactly  to  those  identified  by  immunohistochemistry  [19,20]  and  used  in 
clinical practice [21]. 
Additionally, gene signatures which predict the response to individual agents can be used 
in  combination 
  Dietary 
chemopreventive agents certainly exhibit cell-type specificity, but because of their broad 
ranging activity, they may be effective against different tumour subtypes.             Recent 
studies  show  that  indole-3-carbinol  (I3C)  induces  apoptosis  by  decreasing  expression  of 

the  efficacy  of  multidrug  regimes  [22].

genes essential for tumour cell viability, such as ERα and EGFR in breast cells of luminal 
A and basal-like subtypes [23,24] 
Molecular biomarkers 
There is no doubt that identification of reliable molecular markers, such as those in subtype 
molecular signatures, would be extremely advantageous to accurately predict efficacy of 
any intervention. Ideal markers should be indicative of early changes, relate directly to the 
carcinogenic  process  and  where  possible  allow 
invasive  assessment  of 
chemopreventive efficacy [25].  For some approaches, this requires a detailed knowledge 
of  not  only  the  stages  of  carcinogenesis  for  a  particular  tumour  subtype,  but  also  the 
mechanisms of action of the preventive agent.  Molecular biomarkers would be valuable as 
targets  to  identify  new  agents  or  to  optimise  lead  compounds;  as  risk  biomarkers  for 
selecting  suitable  cohorts  for  chemopreventive  trials;  or  as  indicators  of  efficacy  for 
determining response to mechanism-based interventions or identifying potential toxicity.   
There  is  no  shortage  of  candidate  proteins  related  to  oncogenic  processes  (drug 
metabolising  enzymes,  growth  factors,  transcription  factors,  cell  cycle  and  apoptosis 
related proteins) known to be aberrantly expressed in various tumours and modulated by 
phytochemicals in vitro (Table 1).  The philosophy of chemoprevention suggests long-term 
or  life-time  exposure  to  low  doses.    Therefore,  when  selecting  potential  biomarkers  of 
efficacy,  it  is  essential  to  ensure  that  they  are  modulated  under  appropriate  conditions.  
However, many of the in vitro mechanistic studies have been carried out with single high 
doses of chemopreventive agent that are not achievable in vivo.  Thus some of the reported 
effects may not be physiologically relevant. In order to better predict how phytochemicals 
may  act 
  Pharmacokinetic  and 
pharmacodynamic  studies  allow  estimates  of  plasma  and,  in  some  cases  tissue, 
concentrations  to  be  made.    Where  these  already  exist,  they  indicate  that  achievable 
concentrations are in the nanomolar, or at best, low micromolar range. In humans curcumin 
levels  are  typically  in  the  low  nanomolar  range,  although  ~10  μM  can  be  achieved  in 
colorectal tissue.  Resveratrol plasma concentrations of ~2μM appear typical [reviewed in 
26].  These low doses then need to be applied in cell culture studies over extended periods 
to better mimic in vivo exposure.  We exposed the metastatic breast line, MDA-MB231, to 
physiologically achievable concentrations of five agents in long-term culture and observed 
favourable  alterations  to  cell  cycle,  clonogenicity,  apoptosis  and  expression  of  several 
proteins associated with EMT (Moiseeva et al unpublished data).  Encouragingly, quite a 

in  humans,  several  approaches  are 

less 

required.

few  published  studies,  in  which  single  treatments  with  physiological  concentrations  of 
dietary agents have been used in vitro, also reveal significant biological activity [reviewed 
in  26].    Additionally  a  number  of  phytochemical  effects  observed  in  vitro  have  been 
validated in animal models.   
       Monolayer cultures are unrepresentative of in vivo environments, so that models where 
cells  are  grown  on  relevant  substrata  like  collagen,  laminin  or  matrigel,  or  as  3-
dimensional spheroids may be more compatible with in vivo activity.  We found that breast 
cells  responded  differently  to  I3C  under  such  growing  conditions  [27].  In  3D  culture 
(collagen 1 or spheroids) the sensitivity of MCF7 and MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells 
towards I3C was increased.  In MDA-MB-468 cells the expression of the EGFR and β1-
integrin  was  modulated  by  3D  culture,  with  cells  responding  differently  to  EGF  or  the 
EGFR  inhibitor,  PD153035.      Phytochemical  effects  are  often  cell-type  specific  and  so 
different panels of biomarkers may be required for different target tissues, or for different 
cancer  subtypes  within  a  single  tissue.    On  the  other  hand  there  appears  to  be  a  certain 
degree  of  similarity  in  the  protein  targets  affected  by  a  variety  of  structurally  unrelated 
phytochemicals, suggesting similar mechanisms of action (Table 1).  
A  detailed  understanding  of  the  effects  of  dietary  agents  (for  example  on  growth  factor 
signalling,  EMT,  cell  cycle  arrest  and  apoptosis)  following  extended  treatment  at 
physiologically achievable doses, and related to target tissue and cancer subtype, will help 
to  identify  useful  biomarkers.    Such  an  understanding  would  include  identification  of 
primary targets of phytochemicals (particular proteins such as receptors, or more general 
effects such as endoplasmic reticulum stress or altered redox status), an appreciation as to 
why  healthy  cells  are  generally  more  resistant  and  comparison  of  in  vitro  with  in  vivo 
efficacy.   
Cancer-initiating stem cells 
An increasing number of studies are reporting the identification of a subset of cancer stem 
cells within a tumour, which are thought to be responsible for the highly aggressive nature 
of different cancers.  Breast cancer cells, grown in immune compromised mice, contained a 
subpopulation 
antigen 
(ESA)+CD44+CD24-/lowLineage-]. This subset maintained the ability to form new tumours 
[28 Al-Hajj].  Interestingly, the basal-like breast cancer subtype has similarity with breast 
stem  cells  [20,  29],  suggesting  the  “stem-like”  characteristics  of  this  subtype  may  be 
responsible for its aggressiveness and poor prognosis. Using a xenograft model of primary 
human pancreatic adenocarcinoma, Li et al [30] described a subpopulation of cancer cells 

surface  markers

[epithelial

[expressing CD44, CD24 and ESA] that were 100-fold more tumorigenic than other cells 
from  the  same  tumours.    Similarly  O’Brien  et  al.,  [31]  identified  a  highly  tumorigenic 
subset of colon cancer cells positive for CD133 (1 colon cancer initiating cell per 5.7 x 104 
tumour  cells).    Clearly  if  biomarkers  can  be  used  reliably  to  identify  subsets  of  cancer 
initiating cells, it will be essential to determine the efficacy of treatments against these, in 
preference to other phenotypes within the tumour. 
Dietary agents in combined treatments 
Also of increasing importance is the investigation of combinations of phytochemicals, or 
their  use  in  conjunction  with  other  therapies,  to  increase  efficacy  or  decrease  unwanted 
side  effects  [26,  32].      We  have  shown  in  breast  cell  lines  that  I3C  exhibits  enhanced 
efficacy in combination with src or EGFR kinase inhibitors [24] and in vivo I3C prevented 
the  hepatotoxicity  of  trabectidin  (ET743),  an  experimental  anti-tumour  drug  with 
promising activity in sarcoma, breast and ovarian carcinomas, without compromising anti-
tumour efficacy [33].  Curcumin enhances the efficacy of oxaliplatin in both p53-positive and 
p53mutant  colon  cancer  cells  [34].    However,  caution  is  required,  since  it  has  also  been 
reported  to  compromise  the  efficacy  of  some  chemotherapeutic  drugs  in  human  breast 
cancer models [35]. 
Proteomics 
Methods which do not require a detailed knowledge of mechanisms, initially at least, offer 
an alternative approach to developing biomarkers and assessing chemopreventive efficacy. 
Mass  spectrometry  of  biological  samples  offers  a  powerful  proteomic  tool  for  the 
discovery  of  novel  biomarkers  and  for  profiling  [36].    Proteins  and  peptides  in  clinical 
samples reflect the intracellular activities of healthy and diseased tissue.  Plasma samples 
subjected to mass spectrometry can provide characteristic protein profiles, when over- and 
under-expressed peptides are determined by pattern comparison using a variety of machine 
learning  algorithms  [37-39].  This  technique  should  offer  the  possibility  of  monitoring 
plasma  profiles  in  at  risk  individuals  in  response  to  a  particular  treatment  regime.   
Development of these methods for cultured cells, would also provide the means to screen 
effects of chemopreventive agents – for example, to estimate the lowest concentration of 
agent  that  causes  a  change  in  profile;  to  look  for  dose-response  in  altered  peaks;  to 
compare  effects  of  one  agent  in  different  cell  types;  to  compare  the  signatures  between 
compounds  in  the  same  cell  type;  and  to  enable  identification  of  signature  peaks. 
Individual  proteins  can  be  identified  by  correlating  the  sequences  of  tryptic  peptides 
generated  by  tandem  mass  spectrometry  (MS/MS)  with  sequences  in  protein  databases. 

 

7

The  evolutionary  algorithms  with  support  vector  machine  (SVM)  supervised  learning 
enable  identification  of  biomarkers  with  the  highest  diagnostic  and  prognostic  potential. 
The effectiveness of combined treatments could also be explored. Nuclear fractions could 
provide enrichment for investigating changes in transcription factors and cell cycle-related 
proteins.    In  view  of  the  importance  of  protein  phosphorylation  in  proliferation, 
differentiation  and  apoptosis,  development  of  techniques  selective  for  phosphopeptides 
would provide added value [40, 41]. 
Conclusions 
In order to fully appreciate the potential for dietary compounds in cancer prevention and 
bridge the gap between apparent in vitro efficacy and clinical use, a number of  approaches 
are required.  Attention must be paid to the use of physiologically relevant concentrations, 
to  chronic  exposure  and  to  3D  cultures,  to  more  accurately  mimic  in  vivo  situations.  
Validation of potential mechanisms in appropriate animal models is also important.  The 
mechanistic biomarkers identified in vitro need to be verified in human tissues as being 
central  to  the  carcinogenic  process.    Finally  genomics  and  proteomics  approaches  offer 
novel ways of predicting clinical efficacy.

Altered expression/activity 

 
The expression, phosphorylation, activity or binding of the proteins listed is affected by five of the 
best-studied dietary agents - data are taken from in vitro studies in many cell types, but the list is 
not comprehensive.  There are many mechanistic similarities between compounds of different 
chemical structures indicated in bold.  We apologise to all the authors for not citing the original 
references owing to space restrictions.  DIM – di-indolylmethane.
