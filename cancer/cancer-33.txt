ABSTRACT We investigated the effect of dietary supple-
mentation with isoﬂavones on pulmonary metastasis of
B16BL6 murine melanoma cells in C57BL/6 mice. Mice were
fed a basal AIN-93G diet or the basal diet supplemented with
the isoﬂavones genistein and daidzein at 113 ␮mol/kg, 225
␮mol/kg, 450 ␮mol/kg, or 900 ␮mol/kg for 2 wk before and
after the intravenous injection of 0.5 x 105 melanoma cells. At
necropsy, the number and size of tumors that formed in the
lungs were determined. The number of mice that had >15
lung tumors was 17 in the control group, and 16, 15, 13, and 10
in the groups fed isoﬂavones at 113 ␮mol/kg, 225 ␮mol/kg,
450 ␮mol/kg and 900 ␮mol/kg, respectively. The latter two
were signiﬁcantly different from the control (P ≤ 0.05). The
median number of tumors in the control group was 67, and
those in the isoﬂavone-supplemented groups were 57, 33, 32,
and 17, respectively. The last was signiﬁcantly different from
the control (P ≤ 0.05). Dietary supplementation with isoﬂa-
vones at 225 ␮mol/kg, 450 ␮mol/kg, and 900 ␮mol/kg also
signiﬁcantly decreased tumor size (median cross-sectional
area and volume) compared to the control values. We con-
clude that dietary supplementation with isoﬂavones reduces
experimental metastasis of melanoma cells in mice. J. Nutr.

Epidemiologic studies suggest that consumption of foods that
are high in soybean-based products is associated with a reduced
risk of breast (Lee et al. 1991), prostate (Severson et al. 1989),
uterine (Goodman et al. 1997), and gastric cancers (Nagai et al.
1982) in humans. Dietary supplementation with soybean protein
isolate (SPI)4 (Hawrylewicz et al. 1991) or soybean chips (Barnes
et al. 1990) reduces mammary carcinogenesis in female rats.
Adding autoclaved raw soybean to the diet of male mice inhibits

bladder (Mokhtar et al. 1988). These protective effects are asso-
ciated with soy isoﬂavones, e.g. genistein and daidzein. Long-term
intraperitoneal administration of genistein and daidzein to young
rats (Constantinou et al. 1996) and subcutaneous injection of
genistein to neonatal rats (Lamartiniere et al. 1995) reduce the
development of mammary carcinoma after exposure of the ani-
mals to carcinogens. Other studies showed that soy-derived prod-
ucts have no effect on tumorigenesis in some animal models
(Reddy et al. 1976).

Soybean is a rich source of dietary isoﬂavones (Murphy 1982).
Isoﬂavones exist in soybean primarily as conjugated glycosides.
Following ingestion, they are hydrolyzed to aglycones by glycosi-
dases produced by intestinal bacteria. The conjugates genistin,
daidzin, and glycitin and their aglycones, genistein, daidzein, and
glycitein constitute 90–95% of the total soy isoﬂavones (Murphy
1982). It appears that the unconjugated aglycones are associated
with many biological properties of isoﬂavones that may be re-
sponsible for their anticancer activities. These include antiestro-
genic activity (Folman and Pope 1966), inhibition of protein
tyrosine kinases (Akiyama et al. 1987), regulation of cell cycle
progression and apoptosis (Kroemer et al. 1995), and antiangio-
genic activity (Fotsis et al. 1993).

Metastasis, the spread of malignant cells from a primary neo-
plasm to distant organs that results in the development of sec-
ondary tumors, is the most devastating aspect of cancer. Ad-
vances in surgical techniques and adjuvant therapies have proven
useful in the treatment of primary tumors. However, metastasis
remains a major cause of poor prognosis and death in cancer
patients. We recently reported that dietary supplementation with
SPI reduces pulmonary metastasis of murine melanoma cells in
mice (Yan et al. 1997). Connolly et al. (1997) reported that
soybean chips inhibit metastasis of human mammary carcinoma
cells in athymic nude mice. These studies suggest that dietary
soybean is useful in preventing the spread of malignant cells.

The objective of the present study was to determine whether
isoﬂavones present in SPI reduce metastasis. To accomplish this,
the effect of dietary supplementation with isoﬂavones genistein
and daidzein on pulmonary metastasis of melanoma cells was
investigated using an intravenous injection model.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Animals and diets. The protocol of the present study was re-
viewed and approved by the Creighton University Animal Care and
Use Committee and complied with the Guide for the Care and Use
of Laboratory Animals (National Research Council 1985). Three-
week-old male C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Charles River
(Wilmington, MA). Mice were housed ﬁve per box, in wire-topped
plastic boxes, in a pathogen-free room on a 12:12-h light-dark cycle.
The temperature in the room was maintained at 25 ⫾ 1°C. Mice were
given free access to the diet and deionized water and weighed weekly.
Five diets were compared: a basal diet and the basal diet supple-
mented with genistein and daidzein (Lancaster, Windham, NH) at
113, 225, 450, or 900 ␮mol/kg, which was equivalent to that provided
in the diet containing 2.5, 5, 10 or 20% SPI, respectively (Yan et al.
1997). The concentration of genistein in isoﬂavone-supplemented
diets was 83.3, 166.7, 333.3, and 666.7 ␮mol/kg, respectively, and the
concentration of daidzein was 29.5, 59.1, 118.1, and 236.2 ␮mol/kg,
respectively. Glycitein was omitted from the supplementation be-
cause it was not commercially available. Dietary formulations were

based on the AIN-93G standard diet (Reeves et al. 1993), except that
soybean oil was replaced with corn oil. Diet components were pur-
chased from ICN (Costa Mesa, CA). All diets were prepared in our
laboratory, and each lot was stored at 4°C for no longer than 3 wk.
Experimental design. Ninety mice were fed the basal diet for 2 d
before being assigned to ﬁve groups of 18 each. They were then fed
the basal diet or one of the isoﬂavone-supplemented diets. B16BL6
murine melanoma cells (Dr. I. J. Fidler, University of Texas, Houston,
TX) were cultured in minimum essential medium with 10% heat-
inactivated fetal bovine serum as described previously (Yan et al.
1997). The melanoma cells were collected from monolayer cultures
by a brief trypsinization (0.05% trypsin and 0.53 mmol/L EDTA).
The viability of the cells was determined with trypan blue, and a
single cell suspension was made in serum-free medium. After 2 wk
consuming the diets, each mouse was injected via the lateral tail vein
with 0.5 x 105 viable cells in 0.2 mL. To avoid possible changes in cell
viability, melanoma cells were injected into mice within 30 min after
their collection. The order that tumor cells were injected into mice
from different dietary groups was randomized. The mice were then fed
the diets for another 2 wk. One wk before tumor cell injection, six
mice from each group were transferred to metabolic cages, and their
food intake was recorded over 7 d. Urine collected from each group
(n ⫽ 6) throughout this week was pooled and analyzed for isoﬂavones
(Xu et al. 1994). Isoﬂavone intake was calculated on the basis of food
intake and the dietary concentration of isoﬂavones.

At the end of the experiment, mice were anesthetized using
ketamine (50 mg/kg body weight) and xylazine (5 mg/kg body
weight) and then killed by cervical dislocation. Their lungs were
excised and ﬁxed in 10% phosphate-buffered formalin. The number
of pulmonary tumors was determined by counting visible black foci by
using a dissecting microscope (Yan et al. 1997). The cross-sectional
area of tumors in randomly selected ﬁelds was measured using a
Quantimet 500 image analysis system (Leica Cambridge, Cambridge,
UK). Tumor volume was calculated using the mean of the longest and
the shortest diameters measured and the assumption that tumors were
spherical (Welch et al. 1983).

Statistical analysis. Fisher’s exact test (Steel and Torrie 1980) was
used to analyze the frequency distribution of the mice that had 1–15
tumors or ⬎15 tumors. Bartlett’s test (Bartlett, 1937) for homogeneity of
variances revealed that standard deviations for the mean values of the
number of tumors, tumor cross-sectional area, and tumor volume differed
signiﬁcantly among the groups (P ⱕ 0.05). Because ANOVA can only
be used to compare the means of populations with homogeneous vari-
ances, the results were analyzed using the Kruskal-Wallis nonparametric
and Dunn’s multiple comparison tests (Kruskal and Wallis 1952). The
data were analyzed using the statistic program Instat 2.01 for Macintosh.
Differences were considered signiﬁcant at P ⱕ 0.05.

intake was recorded. The overall body weight of mice at the
beginning and at the end of the experiment was 14 ⫾ 1 g and
24 ⫾ 1 g, respectively. There was no difference in body weight
among the groups throughout the experiment (data not
shown). The mean food intake of all mice (n ⫽ 30) was 2.6
⫾ 0.6 g/d. There were no differences in food intakes among
the groups (data not shown). The daily isoﬂavone intakes for
each group are shown in Table 1. There were no measurable
isoﬂavones in urine from mice fed the basal diet. The urinary
excretion of isoﬂavones (a sum of genistein, daidzein, and
daidzein metabolites equol and O-desmethylangolensin) was
increased in a dose-dependant manner in mice fed the diet
containing isoﬂavones at 113, 225, 450 or 900 ␮mol/kg (Table
1). One mouse from the control group and one from the 900
␮mol isoﬂavones/kg group were excluded from the experiment
because their growth was signiﬁcantly less than all other mice.
Injection of 0.5 x 105 viable melanoma cells into the lateral
tail vein resulted in lung metastasis in all the mice fed the
control diet (Table 2). Based on the number of lung tumors
per mouse, the mice were placed into one of the two catego-
ries: 1) 1–15 tumors and 2) ⬎15 tumors. In the control group,
all mice had ⬎15 lung tumors (Table 2). By contrast, 89, 83,
72, and 59% of the mice in groups fed the diets containing
isoﬂavones at 113, 225, 450, and 900 ␮mol/kg, respectively,
had ⬎15 tumors. The latter two were signiﬁcantly different
from the control (P ⱕ 0.05). The median number of lung
tumors in the control group was 67. The median number of
lung tumors reduced in the 900 ␮mol/kg isoﬂavone/kg group
compared to the control (P ⱕ 0.05). The mean number of lung
tumors in mice fed the isoﬂavone-supplemented diets de-
creased relative to the control in a dose-dependent manner.
To determine the effect of isoﬂavones on the growth of
metastatic tumors, tumor cross-sectional area and volume were
determined. The median cross-sectional area was 0.55 mm2,
and median volume was 0.21 mm3 in mice fed the basal diet
(Table 3). Dietary supplementation with isoﬂavones decreased
both variables in a dose-dependent manner. The difference in
tumor cross-sectional area and volume between the control
and the groups supplemented with isoﬂavones at 225, 450, or
900 ␮mol/kg was signiﬁcant (P ⱕ 0.01).

isoﬂavones at concentrations equivalent to that provided in
the SPI diets decreased the number of lung tumors and the
tumor cross-sectional area and volume compared to the con-
trols. The dietary isoﬂavone content was positively correlated
with both the urinary isoﬂavone concentration and the mag-
nitude of the inhibitory effect on metastasis. Dietary supple-
mentation with isoﬂavones up to 900 ␮mol/kg had no adverse
effect on the growth of mice during the experimental period.
These results indicate that isoﬂavones effectively reduced pul-
monary metastasis of melanoma cells and also retarded the
growth of those tumors that developed in the lungs.

The observations from this study provide the ﬁrst evidence
that dietary supplementation with isoﬂavones reduces experimen-
tal metastasis. This is supported by the ﬁndings that oral admin-
istration of genistein inhibits lung metastasis of melanoma cells
intravenously injected into mice (Menon et al. 1998). Interest-
ingly, they found that daidzein was ineffective in reducing me-
tastasis. In the present study, the effect of dietary supplementation
with either genistein or daidzein alone was not tested. However,
the concentration of genistein in the experimental diets was
threefold greater than that of daidzein. Thus, the protective effect
of dietary isoﬂavones on experimental metastasis may be largely
attributed to genistein. Whether daidzein is without an effect is
difﬁcult to conclude from the currently available data. In the
study described by Menon et al. (1998), injection of 1 x 106
melanoma cells into mice led to the development of uncountable
massive lung tumors in control and daidzein-treated animals.
Thus, they were unable to determine whether or not daidzein was
effective in reducing metastasis.

At present, the mechanism whereby dietary soybean or isoﬂa-

vones reduces metastasis remains unknown. The experimental
metastasis model employed in the present study measured the
extravasation of melanoma cells from the cardiovascular system
into the interstitum of the lungs. This requires invasion of the
subendothelial basement membrane. Genistein inhibits the in-
vasion of extracellular matrix by BALB/c mammary carcinoma
cells in vitro (Scholar and Toews 1994). This may be due to an
effect of genistein on cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix.
Genistein is a potent inhibitor of protein tyrosine kinases
(Akiyama et al. 1987). Protein tyrosine kinases phosphorylate
tyrosine residues on proteins that participate in signal transduc-
tion events, including integrin-mediated cell adhesion (Hynes
1992). It was shown that genistein inhibits epithelial growth
factor-stimulated integrin expression by human breast cancer
(Narita et al. 1996) and esophageal cancer cells (Sato et al.
1996). Furthermore, genistein inhibits integrin-mediated cell ad-
hesion by lymphoma cells (Weimar et al. 1997) and arterial
smooth muscle cells (Hedin et al. 1997). These observations
suggest that isoﬂavones could reduce metastasis by affecting cell
adhesion. A second possibility is by reducing protease activity.
Genistein inhibits the secretion of urokinase-type plasminogen
activator and metalloproteinase by LM3 murine mammary tumor
cells (Aguirre Ghiso et al. 1998). These effects were also attrib-
uted to the inhibition of protein tyrosine kinases. It should be
noted that in these studies genistein was used as a pharmacolog-
ical tool to study signal transduction events rather than as a
dietary component. The high concentrations employed are be-
yond the level that is achievable in animals consuming a soy-
containing diet. Thus, exposure of cultured cells to isoﬂavones in
vitro is not comparable to providing animals with soybean- or

isoﬂavone-supplemented diets. Therefore, caution should be
taken when data from in vitro experiments are used to explain a
dietary effect of soybean or isoﬂavones in animal studies.

The results of the present study demonstrate that tumor cross-
sectional area and volume of mice fed the isoﬂavone diets were
signiﬁcantly reduced compared to those of mice fed the basal diet.
A decrease in tumor size could be due to prolonged retention of
tumor cells in the circulatory system or an inhibition of malignant
cell proliferation after they take up residence in the lungs. Most
circulating B16 melanoma cells rapidly die following their intra-
venous injection (Fidler 1970). Approximately 1% of the cells
survive for 24 h, and one tenth of them form tumor colonies in
the lungs. Therefore, it is unlikely that retention in the circula-
tion explains the difference in tumor size between the control and
the isoﬂavone-supplemented groups. Rather, it is more likely that
this difference is due to the inhibition of mitosis of malignant
cells in the lungs. Investigations in our laboratory designed to
determine the effect of dietary isoﬂavones on cell proliferation
and angiogenesis during the formation of metastatic tumor will
clarify this possibility.

Comparing results of the present study with our previous
report on dietary SPI and experimental metastasis (Yan et al.
1997), it appears that SPI is more effective in reducing the
number of lung tumors than the isoﬂavone-equivalent diets.
Soybean contains several potential anticancer components
other than isoﬂavones, e. g., protease inhibitors (Kennedy
1993) and saponins (Koratkar and Rao 1997). Although these
agents are largely eliminated during the preparation of the SPI,
trace amounts may exist. The SPI also contains phytate that
has been shown to have a tumor-attenuating action in some
animal models (Shamsuddin et al. 1988). Finally, glycitein,
which was present in the SPI employed in our previous study
(Yan et al. 1997), was not supplemented in the diet in the
present study. Thus, these variations could contribute, at least
in part, to the differences observed in these two studies.

In summary, results of the present study demonstrate that
dietary supplementation with isoﬂavones reduced experimen-
tal metastasis of melanoma cells in mice and also inhibited the
growth of metastatic tumors that developed in the lungs. We
conclude that isoﬂavones are responsible, at least in part, for
the protective effect of dietary soybean on experimental me-
tastasis of melanoma cells in mice.
