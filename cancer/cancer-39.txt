A well known, epidemiologically reproducible risk factor for human
carcinomas is the long-term consumption of “red meat” of mamma-
lian origin. Although multiple theories have attempted to explain
this human-specific association, none have been conclusively
proven. We used an improved method to survey common foods
for free and glycosidically bound forms of the nonhuman sialic acid
N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc), showing that it is highly and
selectively enriched in red meat. The bound form of Neu5Gc is bio-
available, undergoing metabolic incorporation into human tissues,
despite being a foreign antigen. Interactions of this antigen with
circulating anti-Neu5Gc antibodies could potentially incite inflam-
mation. Indeed, when human-like Neu5Gc-deficient mice were fed
bioavailable Neu5Gc and challenged with anti-Neu5Gc antibodies,
they developed evidence of systemic inflammation. Such mice are
already prone to develop occasional tumors of the liver, an organ
that can incorporate dietary Neu5Gc. Neu5Gc-deficient mice immu-
nized against Neu5Gc and fed bioavailable Neu5Gc developed
a much higher incidence of hepatocellular carcinomas, with evi-
dence of Neu5Gc accumulation. Taken together, our data provide
an unusual mechanistic explanation for the epidemiological associ-
ation between red meat consumption and carcinoma risk. This
mechanism might also contribute to other chronic inflammatory
processes epidemiologically associated with red meat consumption.

There is a long-standing epidemiological

link between the
consumption of red meat (beef, pork, and lamb) and the
incidence of carcinomas, atherosclerosis, type 2 diabetes, and all-
cause mortality (1–4). Although such diseases have multifactorial
origins, all are aggravated by chronic inflammation (5, 6). Red
meat-rich diets also correlate with circulating markers of in-
flammation and endothelial dysfunction (7). Here, we focus on red
meat-related risk of carcinomas (further citations regarding the
association are provided in Table S1). Corroboration comes from
the low rates of carcinomas in populations that consume very low
levels or no red meat (8–10). Within the World Cancer Research
Foundation report, red meat was among the top 10 factors asso-
ciated with incidence and progression of carcinomas in all pop-
ulations (11). Enhancement of carcinoma risk appears to be highest
in tissues like colonic epithelium, in which adenomas can progress
to carcinomas, driven by molecular changes in oncogenes and tu-
mor suppressor genes (12). There are many proposed mechanisms
for the cancer-promoting effects of red meat (13), including gen-
eration of mutagens by grilling, DNA damage due to N-nitroso
compounds, or free radical generation by heme iron. However,
none of these mechanisms have been proven, and confounding facts
are apparent in some instances (e.g., grilling of poultry and fish
generates the same mutagens, yet these foods are not associated
with cancer risk) (14). Also, doses of the mutagens that induce
carcinomas in animal models are many fold higher than human

exposure (15). Overall, although more than one of these theories
may still prove to be correct, definitive proof remains lacking.

Another unexplained fact is the human specificity of this risk
(i.e., other vertebrate carnivores do not suffer a high incidence of
carcinomas). In this regard, we have suggested an unusual
human-specific mechanism, involving inflammation associated with
metabolic incorporation of a nonhuman sialic acid, N-glyco-
lylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc), and interaction with circulating
anti-Neu5Gc antibodies (16–19). Despite the fact that humans
are genetically unable to produce Neu5Gc, this molecule is de-
tectable on surfaces of human epithelia and endothelia, and in
higher amounts in malignant tissues (20). In the absence of an
alternate pathway for Neu5Gc biosynthesis (21), the only possi-
ble source for incorporation is dietary intake (22). An initial food
survey showed a prominent presence of Neu5Gc in red meat
(23). Metabolic incorporation of dietary Neu5Gc into tissues
(24) makes this glycan the first example, to our knowledge, of a
xeno-autoantigen, which can react with circulating anti-Neu5Gc
antibodies (i.e., xeno-autoantibodies) (25). The resulting anti-
gen–antibody interaction is hypothesized to generate or promote
chronic inflammation or “xenosialitis,” which could contribute
to carcinogenesis or to other diseases exacerbated by chronic
inflammation.

Significance

We present an unusual mechanism for the well-known asso-
ciation between red meat consumption and carcinoma risk in-
volving the nonhuman sialic acid N-glycolylneuraminic acid
(Neu5Gc). We first evaluate the Neu5Gc content of various
foods to show that red meats are particularly rich in orally
bioavailable Neu5Gc and then investigate human-like Neu5Gc-
deficient mice fed this form of Neu5Gc. When such mice were
challenged with anti-Neu5Gc antibodies, they developed evi-
dence of systemic inflammation. Long-term exposure to this
combination resulted in a significantly higher incidence of
carcinomas (five-fold increase) and an association with Neu5Gc
accumulation in the tumors. Similar mechanisms may contrib-
ute to the association of red meat consumption with other
diseases, such as atherosclerosis and type 2 diabetes, which are
also exacerbated by inflammation.

Although attractive in principle, this hypothesis has not been
proven in an in vivo system. Notably, Cmah−/− (CMP-Neu5Ac
hydroxylase knockout) mice with a human-like deficiency of
Neu5Gc (24) can incorporate Neu5Gc of dietary origin, but only if
provided in the bioavailable glycosidically bound form (22). How-
ever, such mice do not spontaneously generate anti-Neu5Gc
antibodies. The likely reason is that humans are spontaneously
immunized via an unusual postnatal process involving a human-
specific commensal bacterium that presents Neu5Gc from
weaning foods to the immune system (26). However, an anti-
Neu5Gc response is induced in Cmah−/− mice by active immu-
nization, and specific antisera can be generated. Using such
antisera in Cmah−/− mice bearing syngeneic Cmah+/+ tumors, we
have shown that the anti-Neu5Gc antibodies could facilitate
tumor progression by enhancing inflammation (16, 17). How-
ever, despite this suggestive evidence, we have not demonstrated
that oral feeding of Neu5Gc can induce the proposed xenosialitis
in vivo or that this process can increase rates of spontaneous
carcinomas. Also, dietary surveys on Neu5Gc in food have been
limited, the ratio of bound and free Neu5Gc has not been de-
termined, and effects of food processing have not been consid-
ered. Given our hypothesis that tissue incorporation of Neu5Gc
of dietary origin can have deleterious effects, it is important to
determine the amounts present in typical components of the
Western diet accurately. Although earlier studies attempted to
quantify Neu5Gc distribution in food (23, 27–29), a systematic
catalog of a wide variety of commonly consumed foods is lacking.
Furthermore, based on recent studies (22), it appears that gly-
cosidically bound Neu5Gc is the dietary source that is bioavail-
able for tissue incorporation, and not the free monosaccharide.
However, available data neither differentiated between bound
and free Neu5Gc nor addressed the effects of food processing.
Here, we address all these issues by first developing an assay to
determine amounts of free and bound Neu5Gc accurately in a wide
variety of foods. We then evaluate the impact of short-term and
long-term feeding of Neu5Gc in Cmah−/− mice combined with
passive or active immunization against Neu5Gc. Although the as-
sociation between red meat consumption and colon cancer is most
prominent in humans, we focus here on hepatocellular cancer in
male C57BL/6 mice as proof of principle, because these animals
have a low rate of spontaneously occurring hepatic tumors (30).

Results
Distribution of Free and Bound Neu5Gc and N-Acetylneuraminic Acid
in Foods. Acid hydrolysis and derivatization by 1,2-diamino-4,5-
methylenedioxybenzene dihydrochloride (DMB) followed by
RP-HPLC with fluorescent detection (DMB-HPLC) has been
the method of choice for the detection and quantification of
sialic acids (31). Nevertheless, this method cannot accurately
differentiate between bound and free sialic acids, because the
conditions of the derivatization reaction (1.5 M acetic acid,
50 °C, 2.5 h) result in some concurrent release of bound sialic
acid (this false-positive signal varies with the sample; 8.6% for
a model substrate, such as fetuin; Table S2). For the current
study, we therefore modified conventional protocols by adapting
temperature derivatization conditions (4 °C for 48 h) originally
introduced for preserving acid-labile polysialic acid (32). These
conditions efficiently tag free sialic acids, without any significant
release of bound sialic acids (Table S2). By studying a parallel
aliquot with the conventional method, we could accurately
quantitate free and bound Neu5Gc. Initial base treatment of
samples to eliminate O-acetyl esters also ensured a simplified
profile for quantitation.

Using this improved method, we could accurately quantitate
bound and free Neu5Gc and N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac)
in foods (examples of HPLC profiles are provided in Fig. 1). As
summarized in Table 1 and detailed in Table S3, foods from
mammals (cow, goat, sheep, pig, and bison) contain moderate to

high amounts of Neu5Gc. Three methods of cooking signifi-
cantly altered neither Neu5Gc content nor the ratio of bound
and free forms. As predicted from prior work (33), poultry and
eggs do not contain Neu5Gc and fruits and vegetables do not
contain any sialic acids. Although the CMAH gene is present in
fish, none of the seafood sampled contains significant amounts of
Neu5Gc (with the exception of caviar). As shown in Table S3,
a great majority of the sialic acids in all samples are glycosidically
bound and not free, even after cooking. Overall, the highest levels

of Neu5Gc among the red meats are in beef, which contains up to
231 μg of Neu5Gc per gram of meat, and the lowest amounts were
seen in milk and milk products, with Neu5Gc levels ranging from 2
to 40 μg/g. Beef also contains the highest percent Neu5Gc of total
sialic acid, and this Neu5Ac/Neu5Gc ratio may be relevant because
of likely competition of Neu5Ac with Neu5Gc for incorporation
into cells (34).
Systemic Inflammation Induced in Cmah−/− Mice by Dietary Neu5Gc
and Circulating Anti-Neu5Gc Antibodies. We have previously shown
that anti-Neu5Gc antibodies can influence the growth of trans-
planted Neu5Gc-positive syngeneic tumors in Cmah−/− mice by
enhancing chronic inflammation (16, 17). We now asked if oral
feeding of Neu5Gc could induce chronic inflammation in vivo,
and in a manner dependent on circulating anti-Neu5Gc anti-
bodies. Cmah−/− mice were fed a Neu5Gc-free diet or with the
same diet supplemented with Neu5Gc-rich porcine submaxillary
mucin (PSM), which contains 7–9% (wt/wt) of bioavailable gly-
cosidically bound Neu5Gc, adds only a minimal amount of
neutral sugars and amino acids to the diet, and can cause mouse
tissue incorporation of Neu5Gc over a period of weeks at levels
histologically similar to the levels seen in adult humans who have
eaten red meat for many years (22). The question to be ad-
dressed is whether the addition of anti-Neu5Gc antibodies to
such animals would generate systemic inflammation. Such an
anti-Neu5Gc antibody response can be induced by active im-
munization (26). However, we found that this response is highly
variable and difficult to control or manipulate. We therefore
challenged Neu5Gc-fed or -nonfed mice by injection of anti-
Neu5Gc–rich polyclonal serum, or with a highly specific control
serum, prepared as previously described (16, 18).
Cmah−/− mice were fed Neu5Gc-rich or control diets for 12 wk
and then injected with varying amounts of control or immune
sera calculated to achieve levels of anti-Neu5Gc antibodies in
the range found in humans (34). As shown in Fig. 2A, evidence of
systemic inflammation (elevated levels of peritoneal fluid IL-6
and serum acute-phase proteins, serum amyloid A protein, and
haptoglobin) was seen only with the combination of dietary
Neu5Gc plus infusion of anti-Neu5Gc antisera, and not with
control combinations. Furthermore, the levels of inflammatory

markers showed a dose dependency with the amount of antibody
injected (Fig. 2B). Similar studies were not done in Cmah+/+
mice, because high levels of endogenous Neu5Gc would neu-
tralize any transferred antibodies (24).

Neu5Gc-Rich Diet Promotes Hepatocellular Cancer
Incidence in
Cmah−/− Mice Only in the Presence of Anti-Neu5Gc Antibodies. To
test our hypothesis that oral feeding of Neu5Gc can result in
metabolic incorporation and interact with circulating anti-
Neu5Gc antibodies, we used the human-like, Neu5Gc-deficient
Cmah−/− mice bred into a C57BL/6 background, in which oc-
casional male mice develop liver tumors (30). Two groups of
such mice were immunized with a Neu5Gc-containing immu-
nogen (porcine RBC ghosts) and fed either a Neu5Gc-rich diet
(PSM, containing 0.25 mg of Neu5Gc per gram of chow) or
a Neu5Ac-rich diet containing edible bird’s nest (EBN; con-
taining 0.25 mg of Neu5Ac per gram of chow). Sera from the two
groups showed comparable levels of anti-Neu5Gc antibodies
(Fig. 3A), and there were no significant abnormalities in hema-
tology or blood chemistry values. Although immunohistological
examination of such mice showed Neu5Gc incorporation at
levels similar to those levels seen in tissues from red meat-eating
humans (22), precise chemical methods for comparing in-
corporation are not yet available. We therefore monitored serum
levels of the inflammatory cytokine IL-6, which is frequently
elevated in chronic liver disease and malignancy (35, 36). Sig-
nificantly higher levels were seen in the Cmah−/− mice fed PSM
for up to ∼30 wk (Fig. 3B). We also monitored the mice with
periodic MRI scans. Based on the first appearance of a visible
liver lesion by MRI at ∼40 wk (Fig. 3C), we chose to necropsy all
mice at ∼55 wk. Two of seven Cmah−/− mice fed PSM had early
hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) (Fig. 3D), supporting our
hypothesis that interaction between anti-Neu5Gc antibodies and
Neu5Gc of dietary origin facilitates carcinoma progression.
To confirm and extend the findings, we set up a comparison of
Cmah−/− and WT mice fed Neu5Gc-rich PSM, and also included
control immunizations. We chose human and chimpanzee RBC
ghosts as immunogens for this set of experiments because these
cell types are very similar, except for Neu5Gc in the chimpanzee.
This experimental condition also mimics human populations (25)

in that the antibody response is polyclonal and variable. We also
extended the duration of follow-up to >80 wk, during which
variable numbers of mice in each group either died spontane-
ously or had to be euthanized for severe dermatitis or other
moribund states. There was no specific pattern to these losses,
and necropsies showed no liver tumors. All surviving mice were
finally killed at ∼85 wk. As expected, occasional mice in some
groups had hepatic adenomas or HCCs at this late time point
(incidence ranging from 0–9%). However, only those Cmah−/−
mice that were fed PSM and immunized with Neu5Gc-rich RBC
ghosts developed HCCs at a substantially higher rate (47%; i.e.,
the mice expected to have xenosialitis). This experiment was
repeated in a second cohort, with even clearer results (i.e., car-
cinomas occurred only in the Cmah−/− mice fed PSM and im-
munized with Neu5Gc). The raw data from both experiments are
shown in Table S4, and the combined data are summarized in
Fig. 4A. Overall, in striking contrast to all of the other groups,
almost half of the Cmah−/− mice fed PSM and immunized with
chimpanzee RBC ghosts developed HCCs (histological examples
are shown in Fig. 4B, including an example of lung metastasis).
Immunohistochemistry also demonstrated incorporation of
Neu5Gc into the tumors (Fig. 4C). Taken together, our data
show that the combination of dietary Neu5Gc and circulating
anti-Neu5Gc antibodies specifically enhances carcinoma rates
only in Neu5Gc-deficient animals (P = 0.0043), in an organ that
is already prone to a baseline rate of tumorigenesis. This ob-
servation is very similar to the situation of human red meat
eaters, who show an increased incidence of carcinomas in tissues,

such as the colonic epithelium,
that are already prone to
a baseline rate of cancer incidence. To our knowledge, this
model is the first example in which incorporation of a dietary
molecule combined with antibodies against the molecule is both
necessary and sufficient to induce spontaneous carcinomas.

Discussion
We have demonstrated here that antibodies directed against the
nonhuman sialic acid Neu5Gc can interact with metabolically in-
corporated Neu5Gc derived from oral
intake and promote
inflammation in a dose-dependent manner in the human-like
Neu5Gc-deficient Cmah−/− mouse model. Furthermore, long-term
exposure to such inflammation promotes carcinoma incidence in
a target organ where Neu5Gc can accumulate; in the case of mice,
it is detected in the liver, and in humans, it is detected more
prominently in the colon, prostate, and ovary. Given that glyco-
sidically bound Neu5Gc is relevant for incorporation from dietary
sources, we have also quantified free and bound Neu5Gc content
in various food products, affirming that foods of mammalian origin
are the primary sources.

Chronic inflammation in the context of carcinogenesis and tumor
progression has been studied extensively. Although the adaptive
immune system can restrict cancer development, it can also para-
doxically assist the tumor by promoting chronic inflammation via
antibodies directed against tumor cell epitopes (37, 38). Known
mechanisms include deposition of sublytic levels of complement
with activation of the PI3K/AKT survival pathway (39) and/or
Fcγ receptor-dependent polarization of F4/80+/CD11b+ tumor-
associated macrophages into tumor-promoting M2 phenotypes,
thereby suppressing tumor infiltration by activated CD8+ lymphocytes
(40). Furthermore,
it is possible that intratumoral antibody

deposition accelerates chronic inflammation by inducing path-
ways involving COX-2 (41, 42) and NF-κB (43). Release of re-
active oxygen species by recruited phagocytic cells could also
cause DNA damage, facilitating carcinogenesis (44). On the
other hand, there are many dramatic examples of the successful
therapy of cancer with monoclonal antibodies (45). In our own
recent work, we showed that the range of antitumor antibody
levels that bridge the spectrum from tumor activation to in-
hibition can be remarkably narrow (18).

There are limitations in directly comparing this mouse study
and the human situation. Unlike the case in humans, there was
a single dietary source of Neu5Gc that was not varied in intake
and the antibody production was not sustained throughout the
lifetime of the animal. Also, the target organ for the adenoma-
to-carcinoma sequence was the liver, not the colon. The obvious
question arising from such experimental mouse studies is
whether circulating anti-Neu5Gc antibodies correlate with can-
cer risk in human population studies. We are currently exploring
this possibility, but we are also aware of the numerous compli-
cating variables in humans, such as the varying amount and un-
known bioavailability of Neu5Gc from dietary red meat, the
amount of Neu5Gc tissue loading in benign and malignant tis-
sues, the complex and variable polyclonal antibody profiles of
individual humans, the skewed distribution of antibody levels
within populations, the possibility that very high antibody levels
can inhibit tumor progression (18), and the variability of con-
current inflammatory conditions.

Further work is also necessary to determine the exact pathways
by which Neu5Gc is taken up into tissues, and potential approaches
to prevent or eliminate such incorporation are being explored. The
current findings indicate that this unique example of xenosialitis
driven by a dietary glycan is pathologically relevant and may be
involved in inflammation-driven diseases that are known to be as-
sociated with red meat consumption, including carcinomas.

Materials and Methods
Food Collection and DMB-HPLC Analysis. Sixty-two different types of food
products (raw meat and three types of cooked meats, including baked,
boiled, and fried foods, were sampled) were purchased from multiple local
supermarkets, lyophilized, and pulverized. Samples were treated with 0.1 M
NaOH at 37 °C for 30 min for the removal of O-acetyl groups and then
neutralized. Acid hydrolysis of sialic acids from the underlying glyco-
conjugate was performed with 2 M acetic acid at 80 °C for 3 h. The samples
were cooled to room temperature and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min,
and the supernatant was filtered through a Millipore Ultra Centrifugal Fil-
ter. Aliquots of nonhydrolyzed samples were adjusted to 2 M acetic acid but
not heated. The samples were then incubated with the two different deri-
vatizing conditions (below) and analyzed by HPLC as described below.

DMB Derivatization Conditions. The DMB reagent, as per the conventional
method (31, 46), was made with the following recipe and hydrolyzing con-
ditions: 14 mM DMB, 18 mM sodium hydrosulfite, 0.75 M 2-mercaptoetha-
nol, and 1.6 M acetic acid, and it was incubated at 50 °C for 2.5 h. The DMB
reagent used for the quantification of free sialic acids was prepared as fol-
lows (32): 14 mM DMB, 18 mM sodium hydrosulfite, 1 M 2-mercaptoethanol,
and 40 mM trifluoroacetic acid, and it was incubated at 4 °C for 48 h.

HPLC Analysis. The DMB-derivatized samples were analyzed on a Dionex
Ultra3000 HPLC System using a Phenomenex Gemini 5μ C18 250 × 4.6-mm
HPLC column at room temperature. The fluorescence was detected at 448
nm using excitation at 373 nm. For the separation of sialic acids that might
coelute, for example, 3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonic acid and 3-deoxy-D-
manno-octulosonic acid, an isocratic solvent composition of 88% water, 7%
methanol, and 5% acetonitrile was used. The data collection time was ex-
panded to 90 min. Standard samples were run each day to account for slight
variations in elution time.

Mice and Chow. Cmah−/− mice were bred in a congenic C57BL/6 background
and maintained in the University of California, San Diego vivarium according
to Institutional Review Board guidelines for the care and use of laboratory
animals. Cmah−/− mice were maintained on a Neu5Gc-deficient soy-based chow

(110951 for adults and 110751 for pregnancy/weaning; Dyets, Inc.), a Neu5Gc-
rich soy-based chow (custom order containing 0.25 mg of Neu5Gc per gram of
chow; Dyets, Inc.) made by adding purified PSM, or a Neu5Ac-rich soy-based
chow (custom order containing 0.25 mg of Neu5Ac per gram of chow; Dyets,
Inc.) made by adding EBN. For the preparation of PSM, cryoground porcine
submaxillary glands (Pel-Freez Biologicals) were homogenized overnight in
5 vol of water and centrifuged at 8,000 × g for 15 min, and the supernatant
was filtered through glass wool. The mucin was precipitated by gradual
acidification (to pH 3.5) at 4 °C and left to settle overnight. The supernatant
was removed by siphoning, and the precipitated mucin was centrifuged at
400 × g for 15 min, washed with water, and centrifuged again. Mucin pellets
were neutralized to pH 8.0 and dialyzed using a 10,000 molecular weight
cutoff membrane (Spectrum Labs) against 20 vol of water, with at least five
volume changes. This final preparation was lyophilized, and its Neu5Gc
content was quantified by DMB-HPLC. EBN was purchased from Golden Nest,
Inc. and lyophilized to remove excess moisture. The dry EBN was pulverized
into a fine powder, and acid hydrolysis for DMB derivatization was performed
as mentioned above. It must be noted that the addition of PSM or EBN does not
significantly increase the caloric content of the chow.

Preparation of RBC Membranes and Polyclonal Anti-Neu5Gc–Rich “Immune”
and “Control” Sera. Chimpanzee and human RBC lysis was performed using
30 vol of ice-cold lysis buffer containing 10 mM Tris·HCl and 1 mM EDTA (pH
7.4) followed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Pelleted
membranes were washed in the same buffer until colorless. Protein quan-
tification was performed, and Cmah−/− mice were immunized with 100 μL of
2 mg/mL RBC membrane ghosts (mixed with an equal volume of Freund’s
complete adjuvant) per mouse by i.p. injection. Two booster doses using
Freund’s incomplete adjuvant with the same amount of immunogen were
given 1 wk apart. Two weeks after the second booster dose, serum was
collected for ELISA analysis of anti-Neu5Gc response as described below.
Positive sera were pooled, and nonspecific anti-RBC reactivity was removed
by repeated adsorption against human RBCs. Adsorption was performed
using 100 μL of packed washed human RBCs incubated with pooled immune
or control sera at 4 °C for 2 h, and the RBCs were subsequently removed by
centrifugation. The adsorption was repeated three times. The pooled serum
from the human RBC-immunized mice was processed in exactly the same
way. The mouse anti-Neu5Gc IgG was quantitated using the ELISA method
described below. Based on the above method, these antibodies should
comprise the primary difference between the immune and control sera.

ELISAs for Detection of Anti-Neu5Gc Antibodies in Mice. Microtiter plate (Costar
9018) wells were coated with Neu5Gc-rich bovine submaxillary mucin in the
amount of 1 μg per well in 50 mM sodium carbonate-bicarbonate buffer (pH
9.5) at 4 °C overnight. After washing with PBS (pH 7.4) and blocking with PBS
containing 1% Neu5Gc-free chicken ovalbumin for 1 h at room temperature,
triplicate wells were incubated with 1:100 dilutions of mouse serum in PBS
containing 1% chicken ovalbumin at room temperature for 2 h. Wells were
washed five times with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (Fisher-Scientific) and
incubated with HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch
Laboratories), diluted in PBS at 1:7,000, at room temperature for 1 h. Anti-
Neu5Gc IgG was quantified using a standard curve of normal mouse IgG coated
to the wells under the same general conditions. To confirm the specificity of
anti-Neu5Gc antibodies, mild periodate treatment was used selectively to cleave
the Sia side-chain and eliminate specific reactivity, as described previously (47).

Measurement of Peritoneal Lavage Fluid IL-6, Serum Amyloid A Protein, and
Haptoglobin. Commercially available kits were used for the measurement of
inflammatory markers, peritoneal lavage fluid IL-6 (no. DY406, Mouse Il-6
DuoSet; R&D Systems), serum haptoglobin (no. 2410-1; Life Diagnostics, Inc.),
and serum amyloid protein A (no. TP 802M; Tridelta) according to the
manufacturers’ instructions.

Neu5Gc Detection by Immunohistochemistry. Tissues from Cmah−/− mice fed or
not fed PSM were flash-frozen in optimum cutting temperature compound
(Sakura), and frozen sections were air-dried overnight at room temperature and
then immersed in PBS containing 0.1% Tween (PBST) wash buffer. The sections on
the slides were treated to eliminate endogenous biotin and endogenous
peroxidase, and postfixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin (Fisher), washing
between each step. Positive controls on separate slides included sections from
WT mouse liver, and negative controls included sections from Cmah−/− mouse
livers. The negative controls used competitive inhibition of anti-Neu5Gc
binding, by incubating 20% chimpanzee serum with the anti-Neu5Gc an-
tibody for 1 h at 4 °C before overlaying on serial frozen sections. All slides
were incubated in a humid chamber for at least 1 h at room temperature
