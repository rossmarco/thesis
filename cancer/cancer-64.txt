with Reference to Colorectal and Cervical Cancer1–3

ABSTRACT Epidemiological studies have linked low folate intake with an increased risk of epithelial cancers,
including colorectal cancer and cervical cancer. Riboﬂavin has received much less attention, but there is increasing
interest in the well-established role that ﬂavins play in folate metabolism and the possible synergy of a protective
effect between these 2 vitamins. Folate plays a key role in DNA synthesis, repair, and methylation, and this forms
the basis of mechanistic explanations for a putative role for folate in cancer prevention. The role of folate in these
processes may be modulated by genotype for the common C677T thermolabile variant of methylene tetrahydro-
folate reductase (MTHFR), homozygosity for which is associated with lower enzyme activity, lower plasma and red
blood cell folate, and elevated plasma homocysteine. Riboﬂavin, as FAD, is a cofactor for MTHFR and there is
evidently some interaction among riboﬂavin status, folate status, and genotype in determining plasma homocys-
teine, a functional marker of folate status. The MTHFR C677T polymorphism appears to interact with folate and
riboﬂavin in modulating cancer risk in a manner that varies according to cancer site. Most evidence points to a
protective effect of this polymorphism for risk of colorectal cancer, but the effect on cervical cancer risk is not clear.
The effect of this polymorphism on cancer risk seems to be further modulated by other factors, including alcohol
and, in the case of cervical cancer, infection with the human papilloma virus. An additional factor determining the
effect of diet and genotype interactions on cancer risk may be the stage of cancer development. J. Nutr. 135:

A signiﬁcant body of research suggests that a diet rich in
fruit and vegetables may protect against cancer at various sites.
Nutrients and nonnutrient plant compounds have been exam-
ined as putative factors in this protective process; among these
compounds folate has received a certain amount of attention,
especially with respect to epithelial cancers. Folate is an at-
tractive candidate in this context, because some epidemiolog-
ical studies have supported a protective role, and there are also
plausible explanatory mechanisms. Riboﬂavin has received
much less attention, but interest is increasing in the well-
established role that ﬂavins play in folate metabolism and the
possible synergy of a protective effect between these two

vitamins, which may be important in the context of Western
diets, in which low intakes of both folate and riboﬂavin are
reported in some groups.

Folate and DNA stability

Folate, as 5,10-methylene tetrahydrofolate, is an essential
1-C donor in the synthesis of DNA and, as 5-methyl tetrahy-
drofolate, in the methylation of DNA (Fig. 1). Methylation
occurs on cytosine residues in cytosine-guanine sequences
(CpGs),5 and the methylation proﬁle of DNA is evidently
important for carcinogenesis, although the reasons for this are
not fully understood. Hypomethylation of DNA is an early
feature of carcinogenesis (1,2). Feinberg and Vogelstein (3)
were among the ﬁrst to report DNA hypomethylation in
colorectal tumor tissue. Although folate is clearly important to
DNA methylation, the evidence that dietary folate depriva-
tion alone is sufﬁcient to cause hypomethylation in vivo has
not been unequivocally established, and any effects may in-
deed be tissue speciﬁc. Rats fed a methyl-deﬁcient diet showed
evidence of global DNA hypomethylation in the liver (4),
whereas folate deﬁciency in rats has been associated with
hypomethylation in the TP53 gene in tissue from the liver and

homocysteine to methionine and key to the provision of
S-adenosyl methionine for DNA (and other substrate) meth-
ylation. Individuals carrying the TT variant (homozygous)
show lower enzyme activity, lower plasma folate, and elevated
plasma homocysteine (19,20). In addition, homozygosity is
associated with a change in the proﬁle of RBC folates, with an
increased proportion being in the formyl tetrahydrofolate poly-
glutamate form (21). The activity of MTHFR seems therefore
to be a determinant of the availability of folate for DNA
synthesis or methylation. Riboﬂavin, as FAD, is a cofactor for
MTHFR, and there is evidently some interaction between
riboﬂavin status, folate status, and genotype in determining
plasma homocysteine, a functional marker of folate status
(22,23,24). A study of the MTHFR expressed in Escherichia coli
suggests that the TT variant of the enzyme may be less tightly
bound to its FAD cofactor, whereas 5-methyl tetrahydrofolate
may to some extent protect the enzyme against this effect (25).
Polymorphisms in the MTHFR gene may modulate effects
of folate on susceptibility to cancer risk at certain sites, al-
though there is a great deal of uncertainty in this area. Inter-
estingly, polymorphisms in MTHFR may interact with folate
status to inﬂuence genomic methylation. A recent study by
Friso et al. (26) reports that subjects with low folate status and
carrying the TT variant of the MTHFR C677T polymorphism
had relative hypomethylation of DNA extracted from whole
blood compared with homozygous wild types, an effect that
was mitigated by high folate status. Other studies also observed
DNA hypomethylation in association with the C-to-T poly-
morphism in MTHFR (27,28). Furthermore, increased leuko-
cyte global DNA methylation in response to folate supplemen-
tation may be modulated by homozygosity for the C677T
MTHFR polymorphism (29). However, not all groups report
an effect of MTHFR polymorphism on DNA methylation
(30), and these inconsistencies may be related to the folate
status and the frequency of the TT variant in the study
population.

Folate, riboﬂavin, genotype, and colorectal cancer

Evidence from human studies for a role for folate in deter-
mining cancer risk is equivocal. Much of the work in this area
has concerned colorectal cancer, for which there is evidence
from epidemiological studies for a protective role for folate. A
number of case-control studies have demonstrated an inverse
association between folate intake and risk of colorectal cancer
(31–33), with an average reduction of about 30% for the
highest versus the lowest folate intakes. Interestingly, alcohol
intake may mitigate protective effects of folate (34). Results of
studies examining associations between biochemical measures
of folate status and risk of colorectal adenoma or cancer are
inconsistent. Perhaps of particular relevance is the observation
that folate concentration in the healthy mucosa of patients
with colorectal adenoma was lower than in control subjects
even though circulating folate concentrations did not differ
between these two groups (35). However, others reported no
difference in folate concentration in colonocytes from normal
tissue between patients with colorectal adenoma and healthy
controls (36). It would be helpful to establish whether folate
concentrations in colonic mucosa are sensitive to changes in
folate intakes.

Very few folate intervention trials have been carried out,
and those that have been reported have been small studies
focusing on patient groups with increased risk of colorectal
cancer. Furthermore, outcomes of interest have in almost all
cases been intermediate disease endpoints, such as DNA
methylation, mucosal cell proliferation, or DNA strand break-

colon. Other studies have reported that folate deﬁciency in
rats does not induce global hypomethylation or hypomethyla-
tion of c-myc in liver or colonic TP53 (5,6). Notably, some
evidence has emerged to suggest that folate deﬁciency may
induce hypomethylation only at speciﬁc sites on cancer-rele-
vant genes (1). Evidence is also emerging that folate deﬁciency
may lead to hypermethylation of sites within the promoter
regions for certain tumor suppressor genes, leading to gene
silencing (7,8). Conversely, increasing folate intake can inﬂu-
ence DNA methylation under certain circumstances. A recent
study among patients with colorectal adenoma demonstrated
that a supplement of 400 ␮g folic acid for 10 wk elicited a
signiﬁcant increase in global DNA methylation in leukocytes
and a nonsigniﬁcant increase in colonic mucosa (9).

Folate has a role in nucleotide synthesis, and folate deﬁ-
ciency increases incorporation of uracil into DNA in place of
thymine, which has been demonstrated in various models of
folate deﬁciency in vitro. Increased uracil incorporation into
DNA was reported in Chinese hamster ovary cells, lymphoid
HL60 cells, and human lymphocytes grown in a folate-deﬁ-
cient medium (10 –12). Folate-deﬁcient rats show increased
uracil incorporation into lymphocyte DNA (13), accompanied
by increased DNA strand breakage. Rats fed methyl-deﬁcient
diets also show elevated uracil incorporation into hepatic
DNA (14), although such effects cannot be ascribed solely to
a lack of folate. Interestingly, a highly conserved region of the
tumor-suppressor gene TP53 (exons 5– 8) appears to be par-
ticularly sensitive to folate depletion in rats, showing strand
breaks in colon and liver DNA (15,16). Evidence for effects of
folate depletion on genomic stability in humans is scarce, but
subjects with folate-dependent megaloblastic anemia show an
increased incorporation of uracil into bone marrow DNA,
which can be corrected by folic acid supplementation (17).
Uracil incorporation into lymphocyte DNA was also shown to
be responsive to 12 wk of 1.2 mg folic acid in healthy subjects
with normal folate status, although global methylation and
DNA strand breakage were unaffected (18).

Folate, riboﬂavin, and genotype

The role of folate in these processes may be modulated by
genotype for the common C677T thermolabile variant of
methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR). This enzyme
converts 5,10-methylene tetrahydrofolate to 5-methyl tetrahy-
drofolate, which is the methyl donor for the conversion of

age. Results are inconsistent. Biasco et al. (37) showed a
reduction in rectal cell proliferation in response to 3 mo of
folic acid supplementation in patients with ulcerative colitis,
whereas a study in Greece failed to show a signiﬁcant effect of
folic acid supplementation for 12 mo on adenoma recurrence
(38). On the other hand, Cravo et al. (39) showed an increase
in rectal mucosa DNA methylation after high-dose folic acid
treatment for 6 mo. Clearly, additional folate intervention
trials in humans are needed, and the results of 3 large-scale
intervention trials in the United States are eagerly awaited.
However, in view of the complexity and expense of such trials,
there remains an interest in the development of biomarkers of
cancer risk that are both responsive to exposure to the nutrient
of interest while also reﬂecting cancer risk.

In light of those studies suggesting a modulating effect of
MTHFR C677T genotype in determining functional folate
status, it is reasonable to consider the importance of this
polymorphism in determining cancer risk. In their 2004 review
of this subject, Sharp and Little (40) showed that the majority
of studies suggest a protective role for this polymorphism. A
further complicating factor that should be factored into new
studies is the possible role of riboﬂavin. Although FAD acts as
a cofactor for MTHFR and riboﬂavin intake inﬂuences func-
tional folate status, few studies have examined the possible
contribution that riboﬂavin might make to protection against
cancer. Of interest therefore are results from 2 case-control
studies that suggest a protective effect of an interaction be-
tween riboﬂavin and the TT variant of MTHFR C677T to
reduce the risk of colorectal cancer (41,42) (Fig. 2). These
observations are supported by data showing an interaction
between riboﬂavin and folate and this polymorphism in the
MTHFR gene to determine genomic stability in cultured hu-
man lymphocytes (43).

Further suggestion of an interaction among folate, MTHFR
C677T, and riboﬂavin that may be relevant to cancer risk
comes from a randomized, placebo-controlled intervention
trial we recently conducted in volunteers with normal mucosa
and those with adenomatous polyps. Subjects in both groups
were randomly assigned to a 50-d intervention of placebo, 400
␮g folic acid (low folate), 400 ␮g folic acid with 5 mg ribo-
ﬂavin (low folate plus riboﬂavin), or 1.2 mg folic acid (high
folate). Subjects were stratiﬁed according to genotype for the
C677T polymorphism. Of interest in the present context was
the fact that the riboﬂavin supplement enhanced the systemic
response to low-dose folic acid in polyp patients with at least
1 T allele (Fig. 3), which may reﬂect a mitigating action of
additional ﬂavins on the lower activity of the thermolabile
variant. Furthermore, the high-folate supplement elicited a

modest but signiﬁcant reduction in riboﬂavin status compared
with the low-folate supplement, an effect of folate that we
reported before (24) and that deserves further investigation.

Folate, riboﬂavin, and cervical cancer

Cervical cancer has the second-highest incidence of can-
cers in women, after breast cancer. The incidence is far higher
in developing countries than in developed countries, with
about 83% of cases occurring in developing countries. Recent
global statistics point to age-standardized incidence rates in
developed countries of ⬍14.5/100,000, compared with values
as high as 42.7/100,000 in developing countries (44). Cervical
lesions are classiﬁed according to the degree of cellular abnor-
mality. The lowest grade of abnormality is cervical intraepi-
thelial neoplasia 1 (CIN1), and CIN2 and CIN3 describe
progressive epithelial dysplasia leading to invasive cancer.
Preinvasive lesions have also been classiﬁed in terms of low-
grade and high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions. There
is a high rate of regression of early-stage dysplasia, reported
variously as being between 30 and 62%; regression rates fall
with increasing dysplasia.

The key factor in cervical cancer causation is infection with
human papillomavirus (HPV). There are ⬎100 strains of this
virus, ⬃40 of which can infect the genital tract. HPV strains
have been divided into those that are considered low risk and
those considered to be high risk for the development of cer-
vical cancer. Although there is not universal agreement on the
precise classiﬁcation of all HPV strains, a recent large inter-
national study listed 15 HPV types that should be considered
to fall in the high-risk category (45). HPV DNA is more
common in cervical cells of women with cervical cancer than
in healthy control subjects (46), and antibodies to high-risk
HPV proteins are more common in the serum of cervical
cancer patients. Epidemiological evidence shows convincingly
that HPV infection is a necessary cause of cervical cancer
(47). However, HPV infection is usually transient, and only a
small proportion of women who test positive for high-risk
HPV infection go on to develop cervical cancer. HPV infec-
tion may be necessary but is not sufﬁcient to cause cervical
cancer. Nutritional factors may affect the persistence of HPV
infection and thereby inﬂuence progression of early precan-
cerous lesions to invasive cancer.

Epidemiological studies support a role for diets rich in fruits
and vegetables as protecting against cervical cancer (48 –50).
Folates have been considered as plausible protective factors in

results. Some case-control

such diets, and a number of case-control studies, prospective
cohort studies, and small intervention trials were carried out to
examine this possibility. Nine case-control studies examined
the association between folate intake and preinvasive cervical
lesions or cervical cancer, but the results are not consistent. Of
these, 4 suggested a protective effect. VanEenwyk et al. (51),
who performed a hospital-based study, and Ziegler et al. (52),
who conducted a population-based study, suggested a nonsig-
niﬁcant protective effect. Liu et al. (53) and Kwasniewska et
al. (54) suggested a protective effect of higher folate intakes,
but in the other case-control studies a protective effect for
folate was not evident (55–59). Furthermore, only 4 (53,56 –
58) of the 9 studies corrected for HPV, which limits the
interpretation of
studies used
plasma folate as an exposure of interest, of which 2 studies
suggested a protective effect against cervical cancer, although
not signiﬁcant, whereas a third, which was hospital-based, did
not (60). Other case-control studies used RBC folate as an
exposure, which is a more robust indicator of long-term folate
status, and these generally supported a protective effect of
folate against precancerous cervical
lesions (57,59,61– 63),
that by VanEenwyk et al. (64) signiﬁcantly so. In addition to
the use of folate in blood as an exposure to dietary sources of
this vitamin, some studies examined the relation between
plasma homocysteine and risk of cervical cancer or precancer-
ous lesions. The concentration of plasma homocysteine is
considered to be a functional marker of intracellular folate
availability (the two variables showing an inverse relation)
and may therefore be a more useful measure than circulating
concentrations of folate. Weinstein et al. (61) and Ziegler et
al. (65) were able to show a signiﬁcant increase in risk of
invasive cervical cancer for women with elevated plasma ho-
mocysteine in population-based case-control
studies, and
Thomson et al. (66) showed a similar effect for noninvasive
lesions. Despite some encouraging results from these case-
control studies, randomized controlled trials have not gener-
ated convincing evidence for a protective effect of folate. Four
randomized controlled trials were conducted (67–70), only
one of which demonstrated a protective effect of folic acid
supplements. However, these studies were generally small and,
notably, did not correct for HPV infection, so results need to
be interpreted cautiously.

Folate and HPV infection

The persistence of HPV infection is reported to be a key
factor determining risk of developing intraepithelial cervical
lesions and cervical cancer (71); therefore, interventions that
control viral proliferation should be important to cancer pre-
vention. A few groups examined whether speciﬁc nutrient
intake might inﬂuence this. Giuliano et al. (72) conducted a
nested case-control study of dietary intake and HPV persis-
tence over 12 mo in a large cohort of Brazilian women.
Unfortunately, a restricted FFQ was used to estimate dietary
intake, and the focus of interest was clearly on carotenoids,
although other nutrients were included in the ﬁnal analysis.
Increased intake of ␤-cryptoxanthin, lutein plus zeaxanthin,
and vitamin C were inversely associated with persistent HPV
infection. The authors suggested that carotenoids and vitamin
C might limit HPV infection through antioxidant activity,
which in other models modulated response to viral infection
(73). This is plausible because antioxidant activity was shown
to reduce HPV transcription in the cervical cell line HeLa
(74), and HPV-16 expression was shown to be modulated by
redox status in vitro (75). Interestingly, in the Giuliano study
average intakes of folates were only about 50% of the RDA

and of vitamin B-6 were only about 30% of the RDA, in
contrast to vitamin A intakes, which were generally adequate
with a reasonably wide range. This suggests that either the
FFQ used could not capture these nutrients adequately or that
this population did have low intakes of folate and vitamin B-6.
This is relevant because folate and vitamin B-6 are important
in the methylation cycle and may inﬂuence HPV persistence
through viral DNA methylation. Rosl et al. (76) demonstrated
that HPV-18 DNA methylation downregulated transcription.
Viral DNA methylation is evidently a determinant of viral
transcriptional activity and therefore of viral proliferation.
Riboﬂavin may modulate this effect through its cofactor role
for MTHFR. Sedjo et al. (77) examined the relation between
HPV persistence and nutrients involved in methylation, in-
cluding folate, vitamin B-12, vitamin B-6, and methionine. In
a large prospective cohort study, using a validated FFQ and
measurements of plasma concentrations of the nutrients of
interest, higher plasma vitamin B-12 was inversely associated
with HPV persistence over 9 mo. Notably, a recent prospec-
tive cohort study carried out over 24 mo showed a signiﬁcant
protective effect of plasma folate ⬎ 2.4 nmol on risk of
becoming high-risk HPV positive and of HPV persistence
(78). The effect was still evident after correcting for other
micronutrients. The relevance of folate to HPV persistence is
also evident from the elegant studies of Pillai et al. (79), in
which the expression of folate receptors in cervical cells de-
creased with increasing severity of cervical dysplasia. Expres-
sion of folate receptors correlates positively with heteroge-
neous
ribonucleoprotein, which can inhibit HVP-16
proliferation in vitro.

The inﬂuence of C677T MTHFR genotype

The inﬂuence of C677T MTHFR genotype on cervical
cancer risk is not at all clear. A few studies examined the
possible association between cervical cancer and genotype for
this mutation, but results are conﬂicting. Zoodsma et al. (80)
recently reported a study of genotype for C677T MTHFR in
CIN and cervical cancer patients and healthy control subjects.
They showed a reduction in risk of cervical cancer in women
who were heterozygous or homozygous for the C-to-T muta-
tion. In contrast, 2 other smaller studies suggested that
MTHFR C677T was a risk factor for CIN (81,82). Henao et al.
(83) also reported a protective effect of MTHFR C677T for
CIN2 and CIN3 in a population with adequate folate intake.
Gerhard et al. (84) failed to show an association between
MTHFR C677T and either cervical cancer or infection with
high-risk HPV, and this was also true for the study by Lam-
bropoulos et al. (85). Thus, although there may be an inter-
action between this common polymorphism in a folate me-
tabolizing gene and risk of cervical cancer, there is currently
no consensus of results.

In light of the studies previously conducted and, in partic-
ular, the lack of controlling for HPV infection and MTHFR
C677T genotype, we have initiated a placebo-controlled dou-
ble-blind intervention trial to explore the effects of folic acid
with riboﬂavin on the regression of early precancerous cervical
lesions. Follen et al. (86) published a frank commentary on
why most randomized phase II cervical cancer chemopreven-
tion trials are uninformative. Although the focus of this com-
mentary was not nutritional intervention, the points raised are
relevant. Brieﬂy, this group identiﬁed key factors to consider in
designing phase II trials of cervical cancer: the natural history
of cervical cancer (in terms of regression rates of neoplasia), an
important determinant of sample size; dose and duration of

intervention to elicit the desired response; and consistency in
classiﬁcation of disease status at entry and as outcome.

Women are currently being recruited to the intervention
trial on the basis of a colposcopy-directed biopsy diagnosis of
CIN1 and an oncogenic HPV infection, and C677T genotype
is determined for all volunteers. The patients are randomly
assigned to receive either 1.2 mg folic acid and 5 mg riboﬂavin
or placebo for 12 mo. At baseline and postintervention, sam-
ples of cervical cells are collected for the measurement of tissue
folate status and DNA stability; cervical swabs are collected to
provide cells for HPV testing and for the measurement of
gene-speciﬁc methylation; and blood samples are collected for
the measurement of systemic folate and riboﬂavin status and
for MTHFR genotyping. The primary outcome is biopsy con-
ﬁrmation of regression of CIN; secondary outcome measures
include markers of DNA stability (uracil misincorporation,
strand breakage) and gene-speciﬁc methylation.

Gene-speciﬁc methylation

Variation in promoter methylation for individual genes was
reported for cancers at different sites. There is a small litera-
ture describing methylation status of various genes in DNA
isolated from cervical cells. Narayan et al. (87) found gene
promoter hypermethylation in ⬎80% of cases of cervical can-
cer, with the 4 most frequently methylated genes being
CDH1, DAPK, RARB, and HIC1, with an increased hyper-
methylation in more advanced stages of cancer. Virmani et al.
(88) reported a similar increase in DNA methylation with
increasing severity of pathological change. Interestingly, there
was a different methylation pattern of different genes accord-
ing to pathology; thus, methylation of RARB and GSTP1
appeared to be an early event, in contrast with CDKN2A and
MGMT, which occurred later in the development of invasive
cervical cancer. Taken together, these and other studies in this
area (89,90) suggest that hypermethylation of certain tumor
suppressor genes may be related to the development of cervical
cancer. Work from Kang et al. (91) indicated that there may
be an interaction between polymorphisms in MTHFR and
CpG island methylation status of cancer-related genes. Spe-
ciﬁcally, subjects carrying one or more T allele for the MTHFR
C-to-T polymorphism showed a reduced level of aberrant
hypermethylation in the promoter region of methyl guanine
DNA methyl transferase, a DNA repair gene, suggesting a
protective effect of the C-to-T polymorphism. Further inves-
tigation is warranted to determine any role for folate in inﬂu-
encing the methylation status of key genes. A clearer under-
standing of hypermethylation of genes in cervical neoplasia
and cancer may help in the development of prognostic biomar-
kers and in the identiﬁcation of gene targets for treatment.

Conclusion

Epidemiological studies point to a protective effect of folate
against cancers, particularly those of epithelial origin, al-
though there is currently little support from intervention tri-
als. The MTHFR C7677T mutation appears to interact with
folate in determining cancer risk, and there may be further
interaction with riboﬂavin status. The effect of this mutation
on cancer risk may be site speciﬁc in that individuals carrying
the TT variant appear to be protected against colorectal can-
cer, but the situation with respect to cervical cancer is much
less clear at present. Evidence for a protective effect of folate
against cervical cancer is currently weak, but this may be
partly due to a failure to consider the role of HPV infection as

a key risk factor. Folate may modulate HPV persistence and
thereby inﬂuence cancer risk.
