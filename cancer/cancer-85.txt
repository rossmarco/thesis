Association between fruit and vegetable consumption and oral
cancer: a meta-analysis of observational studies1,2

Maria Pavia, Claudia Pileggi, Carmelo GA Nobile, and Italo F Angelillo

ABSTRACT
Background: Oral cancer ranks as the seventh most common form
of cancer worldwide. Recent reports have examined the effect of
fruit and vegetable intake on the risk of oral cancer, but results are
controversial.
Objective: A meta-analysis was performed to arrive at quantitative
conclusions about the contribution of fruit and vegetable intakes to
the occurrence of oral cancer.
Design: A comprehensive, systematic bibliographic search of med-
ical literature published up to September 2005 was conducted to
identify relevant studies. Separate meta-analyses were conducted for
fruit and vegetable consumption. The effect of portion or daily intake
of fruit or vegetables on the risk of oral cancer was calculated. A
multivariate meta-regression analysis was performed to explore het-
erogeneity. This multivariate meta-regression analysis examined the
effect of quality score, the type of cancers included, citrus fruit and
green vegetable consumption, and the time interval for dietary recall
of the studies on the role of fruit or vegetable consumption in the risk
of oral cancer. The presence of publication bias was assessed with a
funnel plot for asymmetry.
Results: Sixteen studies (15 case-control studies and 1 cohort study)
met the inclusion criteria and were included in the meta-analysis.
The combined adjusted odds ratio (OR) estimates showed that each
portion of fruit consumed per day significantly reduced the risk of
oral cancer by 49% (OR: 0.51; 95% CI: 0.40, 0.65). For vegetable
consumption, the meta-analysis showed a significant reduction in
the overall risk of oral cancer of 50% (OR: 0.50; 95% CI: 0.38, 0.65).
The multivariate meta-regression showed that the lower risk of oral
cancer associated with fruit consumption was significantly influ-
enced by the type of fruit consumed and by the time interval of
dietary recall.
Conclusion: The consumption of fruit and vegetables is associated
with a reduced risk of oral cancer.

INTRODUCTION

In 2002, oral cavity and pharynx cancers combined (hereafter
referred to as oral cancer) were responsible for 쏜400 000 new
cases of cancer and 210 000 deaths worldwide. Oral cancer is
primarily a disease that occurs in men and ranks as the seventh
most common form of cancer worldwide when both sexes are
combined (1). The geographic area with the highest incidence

and mortality from oral cancer is Melanesia, followed by south-
central Asia; other pharyngeal cancers, apart from the high rates
in south-central Asia, are most common in men in Europe.

In epidemiologic studies, the primary risk factors for oral
cancer have been well documented and include past and present
betel-quid chewing, tobacco smoking, and consumption of alco-
hol in the form of beer, wine, or liquor. Poor dietary practices and
nutritional deficiencies have been linked to a risk of developing
oral cancer, but recent reports have examined the effect of fruit
and vegetable intake, which contain essential vitamins and other
nutrients, on the incidence of oral cancer. Findings from these
reports, however, have been mixed; some observational studies
have shown a protective effect with the consumption of fruit and
vegetables, whereas others have not shown this benefit. Many
unanswered questions remain. For example, there is no consen-
sus on whether the benefit observed with fruit and vegetable
consumption is observed with all fruit and vegetable products, or
whether this benefit varies with different types and preparations
(ie, cooked compared with raw) of fruit and vegetables. A proven
association between the risk of oral cancer and the consumption
of fruit and vegetables would have considerable public health and
nutritional implications. Our study provided a unique opportu-
nity to answer some of these questions, because we performed a
meta-analysis that aimed to use all relevant published literature
from observational studies to arrive at a quantitative conclusion
about the contribution of fruit and vegetable intakes to the oc-
currence of oral cancer.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS

Search strategy for identification of studies

We sought to identify all epidemiologic studies that investi-
gated the association between fruit and vegetable intakes and oral
cancer. To identify relevant studies, we conducted a comprehen-
sive systematic bibliographic search through MEDLINE for all
medical literature published up to September 2005. The search

was performed by consecutively entering “oral cancer”, “diet”,
“vegetables”, and “fruit” as both medical subject heading terms
and text words. Finally, we supplemented this search by review-
ing the reference lists of all retrieved publications and the most
recent review articles to identify additional undetected published
studies.

Inclusion criteria

Two investigators independently reviewed all potentially rel-
evant articles to determine whether an article met the general
inclusion criteria, and disagreement was resolved by discussion
between the investigators. Studies were included in the meta-
analysis if they met all of the following criteria: 1) had original
data from case-control or cohort studies; 2) the primary outcome
was clearly defined as at least some of the cancers of the mouth,
pharynx, and hypopharynx [as defined by codes 141, 143–146,
148, and 149 of the ninth revision of the International Classifi-
cation of Diseases (ICD-9; 2) or other classifications that in-
cluded these sites]; 3) the exposure of interest was measured as
servings (per day, per week, or per month) of fruit, vegetables, or
both (other exposure measurements, such as grams per day, were
excluded unless data were provided to transform information to
servings per day); 4) provided relative risk (RR) estimates and
their 95% CIs or sufficient data to calculate these numbers; 5)
were English language studies; and 6) were published up to
September 2005. If a study appeared in more than one article,
data from the most recent publication were used for the statistical
analysis. Studies restricted to oral cancer in subjects aged 쏝45 y
were excluded.

Assessment of study quality

Two investigators independently reviewed the studies in-
cluded in the meta-analysis to arrive at an assessment of the
quality of the individual study. Each article was read and scored
for quality, and investigators, institutions, country, and journal
were blinded for each article. Because no validated tools exist for
a quality assessment of outcome studies, we developed a criteria
list that incorporated elements of previously published criteria
(3, 4) for the assessment of quality items in epidemiologic stud-
ies. The investigators discussed their evaluation; discrepancies
were resolved through discussion and rereading. The list was
composed of items felt to be important for the quality of each
observational study, including the study design [selection bias;
score ranging from 0 (worst) to 6 (best)], the adjustment of
confounding variables (score ranging from 0 to 16, worst to best),
the exposure assessment (misclassification bias; score ranging
from 0 to 5, worst to best), and the data analysis (score ranging
from 0 to 2.5, worst to best). Each subscore was calculated as the
percentage of applicable quality criteria that were met in each
study; therefore, each subscore for a study could range from 0%
(none of the quality criterion was met) to 100% (all the quality
criteria were met). The cumulative quality score was a weighted
average of the 4 percentages. To avoid selection bias, no study
was rejected because of these quality criteria.

Data extraction

All data from the studies were independently reviewed and
extracted with a standardized data-collection form by 2 investi-
gators. Differences between reviewers were resolved by discus-
sion and, when necessary, through consultation. The following

characteristics were recorded from each study: 1) the first au-
thor’s name, year of publication, and country of the population;
2) the study design; 3) the classification used for the disease; 4)
the number and ages of the subjects; 5) any confounding factors
for matching or adjustment; 6) the methods used for collection of
data on exposure; and 7) the odds ratio (OR) of oral cancer
associated with fruit or vegetable consumption and the corre-
sponding 95% CI in each subgroup. For a meta-analysis on the
relation between diet and the risk of oral cancer, we selected all
observational studies that related either vegetable or fruit intake
to the incidence, mortality, or prevalence of oral cancer. Further-
more, a retrospective assessment of the diet was feasible because
oral cancer is not immediately fatal. The studies included in our
meta-analysis often differed in the measurement of fruit and
vegetable consumption, with many different categories used to
indicate the extent of consumption. All studies were stratified by
fruit or vegetable intakes to evaluate any dose-response relations,
and some of the studies performed multivariate analyses to adjust
for several confounders. For the published results of each of the
selected studies, data were extracted to permit the calculation of
both unadjusted and adjusted ORs with 95% CIs to estimate the
association between fruit and vegetable consumption and the risk
of oral cancer.

Meta-analyses

Separate meta-analyses were conducted for fruit and vegeta-
ble consumption. The effect of portions or daily intakes of fruit
or vegetables consumed on the risk of oral cancer was calculated.
The analysis was repeated with the results for citrus fruit and
green vegetable consumption obtained from studies in which
these results were available. For each study, a weighted log-
linear regression analysis of the adjusted ORs was performed
according to the mean, median, or midpoint of fruit or vegetable
consumption, except in the case of studies with only 2 exposure
categories in which the value of the logarithm of the OR for one
portion was used. In open-ended categories, the number of por-
tions was chosen proportionally to those of the other categories.
Weights were calculated according to the methods described by
Greenland (5) and Berlin et al (6). Combined risk estimates were
calculated by using the risk estimates that reflected the greatest
degree of control for other environmental and dietary risk factors
(OR adjusted for confounding factors). Potential sources of het-
erogeneity between the studies were examined by using the
method developed by DerSimonian and Laird (7), which calcu-
lates the between-study variation based on the Q statistic. We
considered that there was statistically significant heterogeneity
when the P value between the results of the included studies was
below 0.1. In cases with heterogeneity, we applied random-
effects models as opposed to fixed-effect models because the
former include both within-study sampling error (variance) and
between-study variation in the assessment of the uncertainty
(95% CI) of the results of a meta-analysis.

Sensitivity analyses

To explore the reasons for the observed heterogeneity, sensi-
tivity analyses were performed by grouping studies that showed
more similar characteristics, such as similar cases according to
ICD-9 codes, cases restricted to exposure to citrus fruit and green
vegetables, those that presented disaggregated data by sex, or
those that were adjusted for a core of variables, such as age, sex,

cigarette smoking, and alcohol consumption. Finally, we inves-
tigated the effect of the poor-quality studies on the overall effect
size by performing a sensitivity analysis on the results by 2
subgroups, which were based on individual scores above or be-
low the median.

To additionally explore heterogeneity, a multivariate meta-
regression analysis was performed. This multivariate meta-
regression analysis examined the effect of certain variables, such
as quality score, type of cancers included, citrus fruit and green
vegetable consumption, population studied (men, women, or
both) and time interval for dietary recall, on the role of fruit or
vegetable consumption in the risk of oral cancer. The random-
effects regression model relates the treatment effect to the co-
variates, assuming a normal distribution for the residual errors
with a within-study and an additive between-studies component
of variance. The between-studies variance was estimated with an
iterative procedure by using an estimate that is based on a re-
stricted maximum likelihood method (8).

Finally, the presence of publication bias was assessed with a
funnel plot for asymmetry, which is a scatter plot of the individ-
ual studies that relates the magnitude of the treatment effect to a
measure of its precision (9); for formal statistical testing we used
an adjusted rank correlation test and a regression asymmetry test
(10, 11). All analyses were performed with STATA statistical
software version 8.1 (12).

RESULTS

Study characteristics

We identified a total of 71 potentially relevant studies that
described the association between the consumption of fruit and
vegetables and oral cancer, but after obtaining and reading the
articles, our predetermined inclusion criteria were met by only 16
studies, which were then included in the meta-analysis (13–28).
A list of the excluded papers is available from the authors. Ar-
ticles were excluded from the analyses for any one of the fol-
lowing reasons: 1) the article was a review paper; 2) the results
from the same subjects had already been partially or completely
published in another included article; 3) the article was a survey
study; 4) the article had insufficient published data for determin-
ing an estimator of RR, OR, or a variance; 5) the article had
insufficient published data for determining a quantitative con-
sumption of fruit or vegetables; 6) the results of the article were
on micronutrients; 7) the data on oral cancer were mixed with that
of other cancers; 8) the article had no measurement on fruit and
vegetable consumption; and 9) the study was restricted to par-
ticipants aged 쏝45 y.

The summary characteristics of all studies included in the
meta-analysis are described in Table 1. The sample size of the 16
included studies (15 case-control studies and 1 cohort study)
varied between 92 and 1192 for the case subjects and between
106 and 36 527 for the control subjects. The studies were geo-
graphically heterogeneous: most of the study populations in-
volved European samples (n ҃ 7), 5 studies were conducted in
the Americas, and 4 were conducted in East Asia. The study
populations in 3 case-control studies consisted solely of men and
one study consisted solely of women. The age of the participants
varied from 18 to 91 y. To give an indication of the actual OR
found in the studies, we also show the ORs for the group with the
different exposure for each study. All selected studies for both

fruit and vegetable consumption reported either crude or adjusted
ORs 쏝1.0, which suggested that fruit and vegetable intake had a
protective effect on oral cancer incidence, although a statistically
significant positive effect (P 쏝 0.05) compared with the refer-
ence category was observed in only 17 of the 32 comparisons
investigating fruit consumption and in 15 of the 28 comparisons
investigating vegetable consumption. In all except one study,
dietary habits were collected by an in-person interview, and
recall of lifelong dietary habits was referred to in 8 studies, recall
of 2-y dietary habits before interview was referred to in 2 studies,
and recall of 1-y dietary habit before interview was referred to in
4 studies.

Data quality

The quality of the epidemiologic studies included in the meta-
analysis is summarized in Table 2. The overall quality ratings of
the studies varied from 0.39 to 0.75, with a median of 0.66. In all
case-control studies, case subjects and control subjects were
identified without knowledge of exposure status and control sta-
tus was not associated with fruit or vegetable intakes; moreover,
in the only cohort study, exposed and nonexposed subjects were
identified without knowledge of disease status. Validation of
disease diagnosis by histology or other gold standards was sat-
isfied in 87.5% studies. With the exception of 2 studies, all used
standard definitions, such as the ICD (8th or 9th revision), to
define the cancer outcome. Most studies (75%) presented demo-
graphic data and 68.8% conducted a statistical analysis on such
data. The extent of adjustment for potential confounding factors
in the relation between oral cancer and diet varied considerably
across the studies. All studies adjusted for age and sex and 93.8%
adjusted for tobacco smoking, but only 12.5% adjusted for to-
bacco chewing habits and 75% for alcohol consumption. Only 12
studies simultaneously presented adjusted ORs for known risk
factors for oral cancer, including age, sex, cigarette smoking, and
alcohol consumption. Statistical analyses in these studies in-
cluded multivariate analyses with adjustment for confounders,
and 93.8% of the studies listed P values and CIs. No studies
performed any power calculations.

Meta-analysis

When all the extracted data were pooled, 65 802 and 57 993
subjects were eligible for analysis of fruit and vegetable con-
sumption, respectively. The meta-analysis data that explored the
effect of fruit consumption on the risk of oral cancer is shown in
Figure 1; citrus fruit consumption was taken into account when
available. Fruit consumption reduced the occurrence of oral can-
cer in all 16 studies, because all estimates of the single studies
derived from the log-linear model were below 1.0, but a statis-
tically significant protective effect was only found in 13 com-
parisons. The combined adjusted OR estimates based on 16 stud-
ies showed that each portion of fruit consumed per day had an
overall statistically significant effect on reducing the risk of oral
cancer by 49% (OR: 0.51; 95% CI: 0.40, 0.65). An almost similar
effect was reported for vegetable consumption: a significant re-
duction in the risk of oral cancer was found in 10 out of 15 studies,
whereas the combination of all studies uncovered an overall
significant reduction in the risk of oral cancer of 50% (OR: 0.50;
95% CI: 0.38, 0.65), and, in this case, data on green vegetables
were used when available (Figure 2). However, the Q statistic
test of homogeneity found a statistically significant heterogene-
ity across the various studies; the results for fruit consumption

(Q: 1754.54; df: 15; P 쏝 0.001) and for vegetable consumption
(Q: 193.68; df: 14; P 쏝 0.001) were heterogeneous.

To additionally evaluate the effect of fruit and vegetable con-
sumption on the risk of oral cancer, a pooled analysis was per-
formed for potential sources of heterogeneity by combining stud-
ies that showed similar characteristics. The pooled OR estimate
for all sensitivity analyses performed did not substantially mod-
ify the conclusions of the overall meta-analysis, although in most
cases lower significant estimates were found, which suggested
an even more beneficial effect of fruit and vegetable consump-
tion. The OR was not substantially changed after limiting the

analysis to high- or low-quality studies, although the OR esti-
mates were lower in the low quality studies of fruit consumption
(OR: 0.48; 95% CI: 0.35, 0.67) and in the high quality studies for
vegetable consumption (OR: 0.47; 95% CI: 0.31, 0.72). Esti-
mates of studies that were conducted in only men uncovered a
significant reduced risk associated only with fruit consumption
(OR: 0.45; 95% CI: 0.26, 0.76); the opposite occurred in studies
that were conducted in women only, in which a significant risk
reduction was observed only with vegetable intake (OR: 0.65;
95% CI: 0.47, 0.9). It should be noted, however, that these meta-
analyses yielded very wide CIs because they relied on a small

only slightly higher protection was found after pooling the 12

cancer risk, which included studies that had more homogeneous
types of cancers (as defined by ICD codes 141, 143–146, 148,

and that related to vegetable intake was 0.40 (95% CI: 0.19,
0.83). This still indicated a protective effect, although in all
analyses there was evidence of significant heterogeneity in the
results between the studies (P 쏝 0.001) (Table 3).

A multivariate meta-regression analysis showed that the re-
duction in the risk of oral cancer related to fruit consumption was
significantly influenced by the type of fruit consumed and the
time frame of data collection on dietary habits, whereas all other
factors investigated did not significantly influence the results.
Indeed, a stronger protective effect was observed for citrus fruit
consumption than with all other kinds of fruit consumption and

for the longer time frame of dietary habit recall. By contrast, none
of the variables tested influenced the effect of vegetable con-
sumption (Table 4).

Funnel plots displaying ORs of the individual studies versus
the reciprocal of their standard errors showed no substantial
asymmetry for studies that explored the role of fruit consumption
on oral cancer risk (P ҃ 0.12 by the Begg and Mazumdar adjusted

DISCUSSION

We investigated the association between fruit and vegetable
intake and the risk of oral cancer through a meta-analysis of
existing epidemiologic studies. The value of the current meta-
analysis compensates for the individual lack of precision in most
of the studies, a problem that was alleviated by pooling the data
of all the studies. The major finding of the present meta-analysis
provides support for the observation that dietary intake of both
fruit and vegetables plays an important role as a protective factor
against the development of oral cancer. Indeed, we observed an
overall 49% reduction in oral cancer risk for each portion of fruit
consumed per day and, similarly, an overall 50% reduction for
vegetable consumption. Moreover, these protective effects were
both statistically significant. The findings of this pooled analysis
are partially consistent with the relatively strong protective as-
sociation observed between fruit intake and the risk of oral and
pharyngeal cancer observed in a meta-analysis that combined
case-control studies that were conducted up to the year 2001 (29).
The previous meta-analysis did not reach the same conclusion for
vegetable consumption, because the best available evidence in
that study suggested that vegetable consumption did not have a
significant protective effect. Our analysis included more studies
than did the previous meta-analysis (16 compared with 9 and 15
compared with 7 for studies examining fruit and vegetable con-
sumption, respectively) and data from 4896 and 4804 cases of
oral cancer for fruit and vegetable consumption, respectively,
although the total sample size in the previous meta-analysis was
not provided. Moreover, in our meta-analysis, the pooled esti-
mate of the protective effect of fruit (49%) was more precise
(95% CI: 35%, 60%) than that of the other study.

The strengths of the present meta-analysis include the accept-
able methodologic quality of the studies on which the analysis is
based, as well as the considerable number of studies and subjects
included. Possible limitations of the study include the heteroge-
neity between the studies, including studies in which outcomes

were recorded with different intakes of fruit or vegetables mea-
sured as servings per day, per week, or per month. Defining the
amount of fruit or vegetable consumption at baseline (cohort
study) or during the reference period (case-control studies) pos-
sibly caused the heterogeneity between the included studies,
because the follow-up period and the reference dates varied be-
tween the studies. Therefore, the results of the meta-analysis
must be interpreted with caution. Because of potential additional
heterogeneity in the populations, designs, and analyses of the
various studies, we assumed that the true effect being estimated
would vary between the studies, in addition to the usual sampling
variation in the estimates (within studies). To account for both
sources of variation, a random-effects meta-regression analysis
was used to combine the results of the primary studies. The
random-effect approach provides some allowance for heteroge-
neity in studies beyond sampling error. This does not necessarily
rule out the effect of heterogeneity between the studies, but one
can expect a very limited influence because of it. It should also be
noted that the phrase “oral cancer” indicates a heterogeneous
group of disorders, and that most of the studies use different
classification systems to define it. If vegetable exposures con-
tributed to only a specific subset of oral cancers, then failure to
find causal associations in the various studies may be the result
of their failure to identify and count the appropriate endpoint
cancers. That possibility, which would reduce the statistical
power of individual studies, was partially addressed by pooling
results of the individual studies in our meta-analysis. We thought
that the different time of exposure and classifications to define
the cancers could explain the statistical heterogeneity that was
found between the study results, but heterogeneity persisted after
we performed relevant subgroup analyses. Although the studies
included in our analysis were heterogeneous, the relation is
largely consistent.

The assessment methods for fruit and vegetable consumption
may also vary between the studies. The assessment is usually
based on self-reported habits, and such data are subject to recall
errors. For example, control subjects may be more likely to un-
derreport their consumption, whereas case subjects, because of
symptoms (aches, etc) related to eating, may have posed more

attention to food and diet recall. However, in the present meta-
analysis, most of the studies used in-person interviews, whereas
only one study used a self-administered questionnaire. More-
over, our meta-analysis was based on observational studies,
mainly case-control studies, and the possibility of selection bias,
misclassification bias related to exposure, and failure to consider
potential confounders cannot be ruled out; these biases can lead
to very precise, but spurious, results in a meta-analysis. In this
case, with regard to misclassification of exposure, recalls of diet
may be influenced by disease status, whereas selection bias may
be related to higher participation rates of patients with cancer
than of control subjects; additionally, participating control sub-
jects are likely to be more health conscious than are nonpartici-
pating control subjects and thus consume more fruit and vege-
tables. Therefore, results are to be interpreted with caution,
because this could have led to a spurious inverse association
between fruit and vegetable consumption and the risk of oral
cancer.

It has been argued that because meta-analyses of observational
studies may produce very precise, but spurious, results, a statis-
tical combination of these data should not be the prominent
component. However, the present meta-analysis allowed for a
careful examination of possible sources of heterogeneity to sys-
tematically examine the strengths and weaknesses of the accu-
mulated evidence, to contribute to substantial improvement of
methodologic quality of research, and to identify potential bi-
ases, data gaps, and suggestions for future research.

A statistically significant funnel plot asymmetry of the effects
of vegetables consumption on risk of oral cancer was detected
with the Egger et al (ie, weighted regression; 11) method, but not
with the Begg and Mazumdar (ie, rank correlation; 10) method,
and this is compatible with a greater statistical power of the
regression test. This asymmetry, which was due to the fact that
smaller studies showed larger benefits, may be caused either by
small “positive” studies that are more likely to be published than
those with “negative” results or by small studies that, having a
lower quality than the large studies, tend to exaggerate the effects
of vegetable consumption. However, despite the significant het-
erogeneity detected, the results of the meta-regression and of the
stratified analysis clearly indicated that vegetable consumption
had a protective effect against the risk of oral cancer.

In conclusion, on the basis of epidemiologic evidence, we
found that the consumption of fruit and vegetables was associ-
ated with a reduced risk of oral cancer. Prospective studies,
which are less prone to recall and selection bias, are needed to
confirm this result. In the case of an established protective effect
of fruit and vegetable consumption on the risk of oral cancer, the
provision of an easily understandable measure of the association
may create the basis for a new dietary pattern characterized by a
high consumption of fruit and vegetables.

MP, CP, and CGAN participated in the design of the study, collected the
data, and contributed to the data analysis and interpretation. IFA (the prin-
cipal investigator) designed the study, was responsible for the data analysis
and interpretation, and wrote the manuscript. None of the authors had any
conflicts of interest.
