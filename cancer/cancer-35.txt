Summary

Background: Insulin and insulin-like growth factors can
stimulate proliferation of colorectal cells. High intake of re-
¢ned carbohydrates and markers of insulin resistance are
associated with colorectal cancer. To test the insulin/colon
cancer hypothesis, we determined whether the dietary glyce-
mic index and the glycemic load are associated with colorectal
cancer risk.

Design: A case-control study on colorectal cancer con-
ducted in Italy. Cases included 1125 men and 828 women with
histologically con¢rmed incident cancer of the colon or rectum.
Controls were 2073 men and 2081 women hospitalized for
acute conditions. We calculated average daily dietary glycemic
index and glycemic load, and ¢ber intake from a validated
food frequency questionnaire.

Results: Direct associations with colorectal cancer risk
emerged for glycemic index (odds ratio (OR) in highest vs.
lowest quintile = 1.7; 95% con¢dence interval (CI): 1.4^2.0)
and glycemic load (OR = 1.8; 95% CI: 1.5^2.2), after allowance
for sociodemographic factors, physical activity, number of daily
meals, and intakes of ¢ber, alcohol and energy. ORs were more
elevated for cancer of the colon than rectum. Overweight and
low intake of ¢ber from vegetables and fruit appeared to
amplify the adverse consequences of high glycemic load.

Conclusions: The positive associations of glycemic index
and load with colorectal cancer suggest a detrimental role of
re¢ned carbohydrates in the etiology of the disease.

Key words: colon cancer, ¢ber, glycemic load, rectal cancer

Introduction

Carbohydrate foods consumed in isoglucidic amounts
produce di¡erent glycemic and insulinemic responses
depending upon the nature of the food (e.g., ratio of
amylose to amylopectin, amount and type of ¢ber,
particle size of starch granules) and type and extent of
food processing (e.g., extrusion, £aking, grinding, and
cooking) [1].

A role of diets with a high glycemic response and
consequent hyperinsulinemia in colorectal carcinogene-
sis has been postulated [2, 3]. Several ¢ndings from an
Italian case-control study support this hypothesis. Direct
associations were found between colorectal cancer and
intake of re¢ned carbohydrates and energy [4], number
of daily meals [5], body mass index (BMI) in men and,
among women, central adiposity [6]. Conversely, inverse
associations emerged for intake of vegetables, pulses,
and ¢sh [7], ¢bre [8], unsaturated-to-saturated fat ratio
[4], and level of physical activity [9].

In order to test the insulin/colon cancer hypothesis,
we decided to evaluate the dietary carbohydrate compo-
nent using the glycemic index (GI), an indicator of

carbohydrate foods’ ability to raise blood glucose levels,
and the glycemic load score (GL), as a combination of
quality as well as quantity of carbohydrates consumed,
and thus a measure of dietary insulin demand.

Patients and methods

A case-control study of cancer of the colon and rectum was conducted
between January 1992 and June 1996 in six Italian areas: the provinces
of Pordenone and Gorizia in North-eastern Italy; the urban areas of
Milan and Genoa and the provinces of Forl|' , in the North; and Latina
and the urban area of Naples in the South [7].

Cases had histologically con¢rmed colorectal cancer diagnosed no
longer than one year prior to the interview (median 1 month) and with
no previous diagnoses of cancer at other sites. Overall, 1225 subjects
with cancer of the colon (688 men and 537 women, median age 62,
range 19^74 years) and 728 with cancer of the rectum and rectosigmoid
junction (437 men and 291 women, median age 62, range 23^74 years)
were included.

Controls were in-patients with no history of cancer,

in major
teaching and general hospitals in the same areas where cases lived,
and identi¢ed for acute, non-neoplastic, non-gynecological conditions,
unrelated to hormonal or digestive tract diseases. All chronic condi-
tions which may lead to lifestyle modi¢cations (e.g., diabetes mellitus,
cardiovascular diseases, etc.) were not eligible causes of hospital

admission. Conversely, comorbidity from the above conditions did not
represent an exclusion criterion. The control group included 2073 men
and 2081 women aged 19^74 years (median age 58) belonging to the
following diagnostic categories: trauma, mostly fractures and sprains
(27%); other orthopedic disorders, such as low back and disc disorders
(24%); acute surgical conditions (18%); eye diseases (24%); and other
miscellaneous diseases, such as ear, nose, throat, skin and dental
conditions (7%). About 4% of cases and controls approached during
their hospital stay refused to be interviewed.

The same structured questionnaire and coding manual were used
in each center, and all interviewers were centrally trained and routinely
supervised. The questionnaire included information on socio-demo-
graphic characteristics, such as education and occupation, lifetime
smoking and alcohol-drinking habits, physical activity, anthropomet-
ric measures at various ages, a problem-oriented personal medical
history and family history of cancer. Body mass index (BMI) was
computed as weight in kilograms divided by height in square meters.
In order to compute waist-to-hip (W : H) ratio, the interviewer measured
the circumference of waist (2 cm above the umbilicus) and hip (max-
imal protrusion). On account of medical or logistic problems, waist
and/or hip circumferences were not measured in 25% of colorectal
cancer cases and 19% of control subjects [6].

An interviewer-administered food-frequency questionnaire (FFQ)
including total energy.
was used to assess subjects’ habitual diet,
Average weekly frequency of consumption of foods or food groups, as
well as complex recipes during the two years prior to cancer diagnosis
or hospital admission (for controls) was elicited. The FFQ also
included 15 questions aimed at assessing individual fat intake pattern
and meal frequency. Satisfactory reproducibility [10, 11] and validity
[12] of the FFQ have been reported. To compute energy and nutrient
intake, an Italian food-composition data base was used [13]. Fiber,
de¢ned as non starch polysaccharides plus lignin, was divided accord-
ing to the type of food from which it originated (i.e., vegetables and
fruit or cereals) [14^16].

The GI is a qualitative assessment of foods based on the incremen-
tal glucose response and insulin demand they produce for a given
amount of carbohydrates. We expressed GI as a percent of the glycemic
response elicited by white bread as a standard food. For each case and
control subject, we calculated daily average GI by summing the
products of the carbohydrate content per serving for each food or
recipe, times the average number of servings of that food per week,
times its GI, all divided by the total amount of available carbohydrate
weekly intake [17, 18]. A score for the daily average GL was computed
as the GI, but without dividing by the total amount of carbohydrates.
For these calculations we used the carbohydrate content of 50 foods
or recipes since 28 foods or recipes, chie£y meat- and ¢sh-based ones
and cheese, contained a negligible amount of carbohydrates [13]. With

respect to GI values we chie£y used international tables [18]. In order
to take into account Italian cooking habits (e.g., pasta ‘al dente’),
Italian sources were used for a few local recipes [19]. Food items for
which a GI had not been determined were assigned the GI of the
nearest comparable food (e.g., tangerines were assigned the GI of
oranges). As an example, Table 1 shows GIs estimated for a few
common foods and recipes.

Odds ratios (ORs) and the corresponding 95% con¢dence interval
for quintiles of GI and GL were derived using unconditional multiple
logistic regression models [20]. The regression equations included
terms for age, sex, study center, years of education, occupational
physical activity, number of daily meals, and intakes of ¢ber, alcohol
and energy. Adjustment for energy was made using the residuals
method [21]. GI and GL were also introduced as continuous variables,
and the unit of measurement were 5 and 50, respectively.

Results

After allowance for age, sex, and center, patients with
cancer of the colon, but not rectum, were signi¢cantly
more educated and reported lower levels of physical
activity than controls (Table 2).

GI was positively correlated to GL (Pearson correla-
tion coe⁄cient, r = 0.59), intake of bread (r = 0.66),
cakes and sweets (r = 0.28), table sugar (r = 0.23), and
energy (r = 0.27), but negatively correlated to intake of
fruit (r = -0.19) and vegetables (r = ”0.12). Correlation
of GI with other dietary and non-dietary factors, in-
cluding intake of di¡erent types of fat, alcoholic bever-
ages, daily number of meals, BMI,
level of physical
activity, and smoking habits were weak (i.e., r 5 0.10).

Colorectal cancer risk increased with an increase in
dietary GI (OR for highest versus lowest quintile: 1.7;
95% CI: 1.4^2.0) and GL (OR = 1.8; 95% CI: 1.5^2.2)
(Table 3). The ORs were somewhat higher for colon
cancer (1.9 for GI and 1.9 for GL in the highest quintile)
than rectal cancer (1.4 and 1.5, respectively).

Findings were similar in separate strata of age, but
the association for the combination of colorectal cancer
was somewhat stronger among women (OR in highest
quintile = 2.0 for GI and 2.6 for GL) than among men
(ORs 1.5 for either GI and GL). This di¡erence was
probably accounted for by a greater proportion of sub-
jects with colon cancer in the female than in the male
sex. No material interaction or e¡ect modi¢cation was
observed between GI or GL and level of physical activity,
alcohol drinking and unsaturated-to-saturated fatty acid
ratio. One hundred sixteen (6%) cases and one hundred
eighty-¢ve (4%) control subjects reported a history of
non-insulin dependent diabetes. OR in the highest in-
take quintile of GI and GL were, respectively, 2.1 and 2.4
among diabetic individuals and 1.7 and 1.8 among non-
diabetic individuals.

We examined the joint e¡ect of GL and di¡erent ¢ber
intake by cross-classifying patients with both variables
(Figure 1a and b). GL was directly associated with colo-
rectal cancer risk in each stratum of ¢ber from vegetables
and fruit (median intake 11.9 g per day). Similarly, low
¢ber intakes showed elevated ORs in each stratum of
dietary GL (Figure 1a). The OR for the combination of
the highest tertile of GL and the lowest tertile of ¢ber

from vegetables and fruit compared with the opposite
extreme was 1.9 (95% CI: 1.5^2.4). GL and ¢ber from
cereals (median intake 5.7 g per day) produced a di¡er-
ent picture (Figure 1b). The OR for the combination of
the highest tertile of GL and the lowest one of cereal
¢ber was 0.8 (95% CI: 0.5^1.5), whereas for the highest
tertile of GL and the highest of cereal ¢ber was 1.5 (95%
CI: 1.0^2.1). In fact GL and ¢ber from cereals were
strongly correlated (r = 0.81).

We also assessed the combined in£uence of GL and
the best indicators of visceral adipose tissue in our study,
i.e.,W : H ratio in women and BMI in men (Table 4). The
OR was 2.8 (95% CI: 1.9^4.1) in the highest GL tertile in
combination with the highest tertile of W : H ratio in
women. Among men, the OR for the combination of the
highest tertile of BMI and the highest GL tertile was 1.8
(95% CI: 1.3^2.7).

Discussion

High dietary GI and GL have been associated with
increased risk of non-insulin dependent diabetes [22,23]
and coronary heart disease [24], but the in£uence of GI
and GL on colorectal cancer risk has been little studied
[25]. Our present ¢ndings show that a diet that increases
glycemic response is involved in the etiology of cancers
of the colon-rectum, particularly of those which arise
from the colon. The associations with GI and GL were
independent from the presence of diabetes. Low intake

of ¢ber from vegetables and fruit and elevated BMI or
W : H ratio appeared to contribute in enhancing colo-
rectal cancer risk when the diet was high in GL.

The positive associations we observed between GI
and GL and colorectal cancer were among the strongest
reported so far for any dietary factor [7, 25], and were
consistent in di¡erent strata of age, sex, and various risk
covariates. The strong risk increase among individuals
on a high-GL-low-¢ber diet is in agreement with the
property of ¢ber to £atten the glucose-response and has
also been observed in individuals with non-insulin de-
pendent diabetes [22, 23]. Fiber from vegetables and
fruit, which accounted for 2/3 of ¢ber intake, seemed to
exert a bene¢cial e¡ect on colorectal cancer risk and,
possibly, to mitigate the impact of high dietary GL. It is
possible that ¢ber from cereals did not appear to be
protective in our [8] as well as in other study populations
[26] because it was derived chie£y from highly re¢ned
cereal products [27]. Data on the relationship between
di¡erent types of ¢ber and glycemic response and insulin
demand depend on the nature of ¢ber and its relation to
the nutrients contained in the food [28]. When taken out
of their botanical structure, isolated cereal ¢ber is not
seen to reduce the rate of carbohydrate absorption while
viscous ¢ber (i.e., guar) has been shown to decrease the
rate of glucose absorption [29].

Whereas consumption of sugar and cakes is relatively
low, Italy shows the highest consumption of carbo-
hydrates from re¢ned cereals among a¥uent countries
[30], up to more than 300 g/day in one ¢fth of this study
population. Interestingly, the highest intake quintile of
white bread, whose GI is 100, was associated with an
energy-adjusted OR of 1.6 (95% CI: 1.3^1.9) whereas the
highest intake quintile of pasta, whose GI is only ap-
proximately 60, showed an OR of 1.2 (95% CI: 1.0^1.5).
Visceral adipose tissue has been associated with in-
creased insulin resistance and colorectal cancer risk [31].

Men have more visceral adipose tissue than women.
Thus, BMI was a good surrogate of visceral adipose tissue
in the male sex while W : H ratio had to be considered
among women [6]. Assessment of BMI and W : H ratio
in colorectal cancer patients is hampered by weight loss
in the proximity of cancer diagnosis. We had, however,
information on BMI changes over time, and we were
able to allow for recent weight loss [6].

In addition to dietary ¢ndings, several lines of evidence
suggest a role of insulin in colorectal carcinogenesis.
Non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus is associated
with increased risk of colorectal cancer [32, 33]. Insulin
is considered to be a growth factor and has been shown
to increase insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I, which is
involved in long-term regulation of energy metabolism
[2]. Insulin and IGF receptors have been found in both
normal and malignant cells of colonic mucosa, and can
stimulate proliferation of human colorectal cells [2, 34].
Tall individuals [35] and those with acromegaly, who
have elevated levels of growth hormone and IGF-I [36],
have an increased incidence of colorectal cancer. Circu-
lating levels of IGF-I and II and IGF binding protein
(IGF BP)-III, which modulate access of IGF-I to IGF-
receptors, were related to subsequent colorectal cancer
risk [37, 38].

We used a validated questionnaire [10, 12] and had
access to a large number of colorectal cancer patients
and control subjects who, in the vast majority, agreed to
participate in the study. The control group included a
broad range of acute conditions unrelated to diet modi¢-
cations. Reported associations with GI and GL were not
restricted to any major nosological category of control,
and held true when cases and controls with a history of
diabetes were excluded. Allowance was possible for a
number of potential confounding factors,
including
number of daily meals, energy and alcohol intake, and
physical activity. Weaknesses of the present ¢ndings
include, however, the limitations of current GI estimates.
Many of them have been derived from small samples
and variations of estimates in mixed-meal situations are
unclear [17,18]. Notwithstanding, the present ¢ndings
lend indirect support to the hypothesis that increased
glycemic response and insulin resistance are associated
with colorectal cancer, most notably with that of the
colon.
