Abstract

Because the association between soy consumption and gastric cancer is inconsistent, we evaluated the putative
preventive effect of soy food on gastric cancer risk in the Shanghai WomenÕs and MenÕs Health Studies, comprising a total
of 128,687 participants. Intake of nonfermented soy foods was estimated using 2 validated food-frequency question-

naires. HRs were calculated with 95% CIs for intake amounts of total nonfermented soy food intake, soy protein, and

isoﬂavones as well as individual soy food groups using Cox proportional hazards regression. A total of 493 distal gastric

cancer cases were identiﬁed by 2010. Although all risk estimates for summary measures of soy food intake above the

lowest quartile (quartile 1) were suggestive of a protective effect, no statistically signiﬁcant associations with risk of distal

gastric cancer were found. Among the separate soy food groups, signiﬁcant reductions in risk of distal gastric cancer by

increasing intake of tofu were found in men in quartile 2 (HR: 0.59; 95% CI: 0.40, 0.86), quartile 3 (HR: 0.62; 95% CI: 0.44,
0.88), and quartile 4 (HR: 0.64; 95% CI: 0.42, 0.99), resulting in a signiﬁcant trend (P-trend = 0.02). Dry bean intake was

also inversely associated with decreased risk of gastric cancer, but in postmenopausal women only [quartile 2 (HR: 0.54;

95% CI: 0.30, 0.96); quartile 3 (HR: 0.90; 95% CI: 0.64, 1.27); and quartile 4 (HR: 0.63; 95% CI: 0.43, 0.91)], resulting in a
signiﬁcant trend (P-trend = 0.03). Overall, our study found no statistically signiﬁcant association between nonfermented

soy food intake and distal gastric cancer risk, though the data supported the hypothesis that tofu may protect against

distal gastric cancer in men and dry bean consumption may decrease the risk of gastric cancer in postmenopausal

women.

Introduction

Gastric cancer, the fourth most common cancer globally with
about 1 million new cases annually (1), is the most frequent
cancer in Japan and Korea, and the second most common in
China, in both men and women (2). Furthermore, it has been
ranked the second cause of cancer-related death in the world;
;738,000 people died from gastric cancer in 2008 (1). However,
gastric cancer incidence is relatively low in most Western
countries, including the United States and the United Kingdom.
This geographic variation in incidence has generally been
explained by 3 interpopulation differences, including differences

in dietary patterns (3,4), subtype prevalence of Helicobactor
pylori infection (5,6), and genetic susceptibility (7), and by their
interactions (8,9).

Dietary habits have been considered an important factor in
carcinogenesis and have been particularly emphasized in the
development of gastric cancer (10,11). The high incidence of
gastric cancer in Japan, Korea, and China has often been
explained by their distinct dietary habits, including eating high-
salt food and nutritional sources of nitrosamine alongside a high
prevalence of H. pylori (12,13). In the case of soy foods, Japanese
and Korean populations are generally known to consume more
fermented soy foods, such as fermented soy paste and fermented
soybeans, rather than fresh nonfermented soy foods (14–16).
Although the cancer-preventive effect of soy intake has been
widely studied in hormone-sensitive cancers,
information is
inconsistent about the role of soy foods for cancer development
in organs not considered to be hormone related, such as the
stomach (17,18). It has been suggested that estrogen plays a
protective role in the development of gastric cancer (19). For

example, exposure to tamoxifen, an antagonist of estrogen re-
ceptor, after breast cancer or endometrial cancer treatment has
been suggested as a risk factor of gastric cancer (20,21). Although
the protective mechanism of soy foods for gastric cancer is more
frequently explained by anti-inﬂammatory effects or an antiox-
idative mechanism rather than the hormone-related effects (22),
the potential protective pathway in gastric tissue remains to be
clariﬁed (23–25). In addition, the inconsistencies found between
soy food intake and risk of gastric cancer in previous results may
also be explained by confounders, or effect modiﬁers, such as
ethnicity, sex, menopausal status or history of hormone replace-
ment therapy in women, fermented status of soy foods, and pos-
sibly H. pylori status or genetic susceptibility (25,26).

The misclassiﬁcation bias caused by the low validity of ex-
posure measurement for dietary soy intake and the insufﬁcient
statistical power by small sample size might also bias the study
results toward the null association. A large-scale prospective
study in a population with a high incidence of gastric cancer could
minimize the impact of exposure misclassiﬁcation and provide
greater statistical power to control for related factors. Therefore,
we analyzed the data from 2 large-scale, population-based, pro-
spective studies, the Shanghai WomenÕs Health Study (SWHS)
and the Shanghai MenÕs Health Study (SMHS), to investigate
whether nonfermented soy food intake is associated with a re-
duced risk of gastric cancer in an urban Chinese population.

Participants and Methods

Study design and participants. The baseline survey of the SWHS was
administered from 1996 to 2000, and the SMHS from 2002 to 2006,
both in urban Shanghai, China. A total of 74,941 women aged 40–70 y
were recruited from 80,891 eligible women (participation rate, 92.6%),
and a total of 61,482 men aged 40–74 y were recruited from 83,125
eligible men (participation rate, 74.0%) during the baseline examina-
tion. The SWHS and SMHS used a similar standard protocol, including
in-person interviews, to obtain information on demographic character-
istics, dietary habits, and other health-related factors. The details on the
study design of the SWHS (27) and SMHS (28) have been described
previously. The studies were approved by the Institutional Review
Boards of Vanderbilt University, the Shanghai Cancer Institute, and the
National Cancer Institute, and written informed consent was obtained
from all participants.

Dietary assessment. The validation of the comprehensive FFQs in both
cohorts has been described in detail elsewhere (29,30). Brieﬂy, the SMHS
FFQ (81 items) was modiﬁed from the SWHS FFQ (77 items), with the
addition of the items of garland chrysanthemum, shepherdÕs purse,
clover, amaranth, pea shoots, and pigÕs ham hock and the removal of
sweet potatoes. The SWHS FFQ combined fresh soy beans, fresh peas,
and fresh broad beans into 1 item, but the SMHS FFQ listed these items
in separate questions. Nonfresh soy bean curd, including fried tofu,
vegetarian chicken, and bean curd cake, was combined into 1 item in
both cohorts, labeled ‘‘other soyfood products.’’ For each food item or
group of foods, we collected data for the frequency of consumption (i.e.,
daily, weekly, monthly, annually, and never) and the amount consumed
in liang (Chinese unit, 1 liang = 50 g) per unit of time. The daily intakes
of
total energy, soy protein, and isoﬂavones were calculated by
multiplying the amount of each food consumed by the nutrient content
per gram of the food as obtained from the Chinese Food Consumption
Tables (31). The daily intake of the dried weight of 6 individual items
[soy milk, fresh soybean, dried soybean, dried or pressed bean curd
(tofu), bean sprouts, and other soyfood products (i.e., cooked tofu,
which includes fried tofu, vegetarian chicken, and bean curd cake)]
were calculated by multiplying the amount of each soy food consumed
by [1 2 (percentage of water content of the food item/100)] (32) and
were combined to compute the daily nonfermented soy food intake
amount (g/d) of each individual. Water content of each soy food was

determined based on the Chinese Food Consumption Tables (soy milk,
fresh soybean, dried soybean, tofu, bean sprout, and other soyfood
products were 96.4%, 29.4%, 10.2%, 85.6%, 88.8%, and 60.1%
water, respectively). For the present analyses, we averaged the amounts
of these nonfermented food items derived from the baseline FFQ with
those from the ﬁrst follow-up FFQ, which was conducted 2–3 y after the
baseline survey (follow-up rate was 91.3% and 81.6% in the SWHS and
SMHS, respectively).

Cancer ascertainment. We initially identiﬁed newly diagnosed gastric
cancer cases by data linkage with the Shanghai Cancer Registry, a
population-based cancer registry established in 1963 and by in-person
follow-up surveys every 2–3 years. Completeness of case ascertainment by
the Shanghai Cancer Registry is very high because of a low out-migration
rate. In the present study, new possible cancer cases extracted by data
linkage with the registry database were rechecked to eliminate any false-
positive matches by reviewing medical records from the diagnostic
hospitals and home visiting. Death cases were ascertained by data linkage
to death certiﬁcate registries and conﬁrmation through home visits.
Among the 678 gastric cancer cases (SWHS, n = 354; SMHS, n = 324)
identiﬁed until the end of 2010, 615 cases (SWHS, n = 326; SMHS, n =
289) were distal gastric cancer cases, including 87 cases of unknown site,
deﬁned as noncardia cancer, which was coded as 151.1–151.9, based on
the WHO International Classiﬁcation of Diseases (9th version).

Statistical analysis. Among the total participants of the SWHS and
SMHS, we excluded the 1,669 individuals with gastrectomy history
before the baseline questionnaire (SWHS, n = 346; SMHS, n = 1,323)
and 1,495 female individuals and 14 male individuals who had reported
a previous cancer diagnosis in the baseline questionnaire or were
identiﬁed by cancer registry data. In addition, in the ﬁnal analysis we also
excluded 227 individuals who had an estimated extreme total energy
intake of <500 or >4000 kcal/d in baseline FFQ or in follow-up FFQ
1 (SWHS, n = 75; SMHS, n = 152), 421 individuals with a follow-up
period of <1 y (SWHS, n = 153; SMHS, n = 268), 3894 individuals who
had reported a history of peptic ulcer medication in the baseline
questionnaire (SWHS, n = 2,411; SMHS, n = 1,483), and 17 individuals
with missing essential information such as status of current smoking or
menopause (SWHS, n = 15; SMHS, n = 2). After excluding 185 distal
gastric cancer cases and 7552 noncancer cases for the reasons just stated,
a total of 128,687 individuals (SWHS, n = 70,446; SMHS, n = 58,241),
including 493 newly incident distal gastric cancer cases (SWHS, n = 282;
SMHS, n = 211), were included for the present analyses.

All participantss were divided into 4 quartiles according to their sex
and median nonfermented soy food intake, including soy milk, tofu,
other soyfood products, dry bean, fresh bean, and bean sprout (Table 1),
from the baseline examination and follow-up survey 1. The lowest
quartile (quartile 1) was used as the reference. To calculate HRs and
95% CIs for the association between nonfermented soy intake and
incident distal gastric cancer under control of potential confounders, we
used Cox proportional hazards regression with age as the time scale,
with a = 0.05. In the fully adjusted model, we selected the variables that
were independently associated with distal gastric cancer risk in the age-
adjusted model and that we a priori believed to be associated with soy
food intake as confounders. These covariates included smoking status
[never or ever (smoked at least 1 cigarette/d for >6 mo)]; smoking
amount (pack-years); drinking status [never or ever (drank at least 3
times/wk for >6 mo)]; BMI (as a continuous variable); physical activity
(metabolic equivalent hours per week per year); presence of family
history of gastric cancer; past history of chronic gastritis; born in
Shanghai and house income as social indicators; median intakes of total
energy (kcal/d), sodium, red meat, fruit except watermelon, and all
vegetables from the 2 FFQs; and menopausal status (in women).
Continuous variables are presented as means 6 SDs. We also examined
the association of soy food and gastric cancer risk among women in
models stratiﬁed by menopausal status. We used the median soy food
intake value of each quartile to test for a linear trend across the intake
amount. We have applied the fractional polynomials approach to ﬁnd
the best ﬁtting model (33). In our data, any polynomial model does not
provide a better ﬁt compared with a simple linear model at the 5%

of aspirin, education level, hormone replacement therapy in women, and
dietary salt intake amount, did not alter the results after adjustment, thus
they were excluded from the ﬁnal model. The end of the study period was

The following are the general characteristics of distal gastric
cancer case individuals compared with noncase individuals at

risk of gastric cancer: distal gastric cancer case individuals were
more likely to be older, regular exercisers, and born outside of
urban Shanghai than noncase individuals among men and
women (Table 1). However, these differences between case and
noncase individuals disappeared in both sexes when adjusted
by age at baseline examination. Compared with individuals in
the lowest quartile (quartile 1) of daily nonfermented soy food
intake, individuals in the highest quartile (quartile 4) were
more likely to be older and postmenopausal, have a higher
BMI, have higher average levels of physical activity, be regular
aspirin users, be ever drinkers, be regular exercisers, and be
more likely to have been born outside of urban Shanghai, after

adjusting for age among both men and women. Daily intake of
total energy, sodium, red meat, fruit excluding watermelon,
and all vegetables also increased by increasing quartile of soy
food intake (Table 1).

Overall, although all risk estimates for each summary
measure of soy food intake above quartile 1 were suggestive of
a protective effect, no statistically signiﬁcant associations with
risk of distal gastric cancer were found. These null associations
did not differ according to sex. Soy protein and isoﬂavones also

showed similar null associations with distal gastric cancer risk in
all individuals and both sexes (Supplemental Table 1).

When examined in separate soy food categories, no associ-
ation between each soy food category and risk of distal gastric
cancer was found overall (Table 2). When stratiﬁed by sex, men
(but not women) in quartiles 2, 3, and 4 of tofu intake,
compared with those in quartile 1 of tofu intake, had decreased
risks of distal gastric cancer (HR: 0.59; 95% CI: 0.40, 0.86; P =
0.01; HR: 0.62; 95% CI: 0.44, 0.88; P = 0.01; and HR: 0.64;

95% CI: 0.42, 0.99, P = 0.05 respectively), resulting in a
signiﬁcant trend (P-trend = 0.02). In menÕs quartile 1, tofu
intake was <3.1 oz (87.9 g)/d of dry weight of tofu, or ;0.62 oz
(17.6 g)/d of tofu. No associations between soy milk, dry bean,
fresh bean, bean sprout, or other soyfood products and risk of
distal gastric cancer were found among men or women (Table 2).
When we stratiﬁed by menopausal status of women, there
was a suggestion of a decreased risk of gastric cancer for
postmenopausal women only whose dry bean intake was greater
than that of quartile 1, that is, women in quartiles 2, 3, and 4
(HR: 0.54; 95% CI: 0.30, 0.96; HR: 0.90; 95% CI: 0.64, 1.27;
and HR: 0.63; 95% CI: 0.43, 0.91, respectively), resulting in a
signiﬁcant trend (P-trend = 0.03). Otherwise, no differences
were found from the models stratiﬁed by menopausal status
(data not shown).

Discussion

Overall, we found no statistically signiﬁcant association be-
tween total nonfermented soy food intake and the risk of distal
cancer in the SWHS and SMHS cohorts. However, among the
separate soy food groups, 2 statistically signiﬁcant associations
were found. Increasing tofu intake was associated with decreas-
ing risk of gastric cancer in men, and increasing dry bean intake
was associated with decreasing risk of gastric cancer in
postmenopausal women. Our study ﬁndings were consistent
with results from the previous epidemiological reports on the
relation between soy consumption and gastric cancer risk.

Speciﬁcally, 2 recent meta-analyses investigated the preventive
effects of soy consumption and risk of gastric cancer. In the most
recent meta-analysis, higher intake of nonfermented soy foods
was associated with a statistically signiﬁcant decreased risk of
gastric cancer (OR: 0.64; 95% CI: 0.54, 0.77), whereas higher
intake of fermented soy foods was associated with a statistically
signiﬁcant increased risk (OR: 1.22; 95% CI: 1.02, 1.44) (17).
This meta-analysis included 18 articles, comprising 6 cohort
studies and 12 case-control studies, but all were from studies of
Korean or Japanese populations (22). A Chinese meta-analysis,
including 10 cohort studies, 16 case-control studies, and 2 cross-
sectional studies, also reported an inverse association between the
highest consumption of soybean products and risk of gastric
cancer (OR: 0.58; 95% CI: 0.52, 0.65) (34). However, although
these meta-analyses and individual case-control studies have
reported associations between soy intake and gastric cancer, few
large prospective studies have been restricted to more homoge-
nous categories for a more precise analysis of these associations,
as has the present study, through the exclusion of fermented soy
foods and a focus on distal gastric cancer only.

Recently a Japanese prospective cohort study, which included
a total of 1249 gastric cancer cases, found no evidence for a
gastric cancer–preventive effect of isoﬂavones or soy food in
either sex. This study however did report an increasing trend of
gastric cancer risk with increasing amounts of isoﬂavones
among women who had used hormonal therapy (18). This
ﬁnding was consistent with the results from a previous study that
the phytoestrogenic effect may be altered by an individualÕs
estrogen environment (35). In our study, hormonal therapy was
not a factor because only 2% of the women in our study used
hormonal therapy. Furthermore, we found no signiﬁcant inter-
action between menopausal status and total nonfermented soy
food intake in relation to distal gastric cancer (P-trend = 0.28),
although there was a suggestion that dry bean intake reduces
risk for postmenopausal women only.

1740 Kweon et al.

Previous in vivo studies have suggested that isoﬂavones,
which are abundant in soy food, suppress carcinogenesis in
gastric cells (23,36), but the potential mechanism remains
unclear. Isoﬂavones have a similar structure to 17b-estradiol and
are able to suppress the effects of estrogen by competitively
binding to the b-estrogen receptor. However, phytoestrogens
have been found to have both estrogenic and antiestrogenic
effects, depending on the speciﬁc tissue and the individualÕs
concentration of circulating estrogens (37). Another biologically
plausible pathway that is able to explain a potentially protective
effective of isoﬂavones on gastric cancer risk is through anti-
inﬂammatory and antioxidative effects. Studies have reported on
the relation of soybean curd and H. pylori
infection (38),
interaction of soy bean intake and interleukin-10 genetic
variants on gastric cancer risk (24), and genistein inhibition on
the growth of H. pylori (39), because soy products can enhance
the immune function of gastric cells (40). Genistein may induce
apoptosis in cancer cell
lines, arrest the gastric cancer cell
proliferation cycle at the G2/M phase (40), and play a role as a
tyrosine kinase inhibitor that
inhibits the proliferation or
angiogenesis of gastric epithelial cells (36).

In our study, tofu and dry bean intakes were inversely
associated with the risk of distal gastric cancer in men and
postmenopausal women, respectively. The inverse association
between tofu intake and gastric cancer was supported by a
previous review of in vitro and in vivo studies (41) and several
epidemiological studies (15,42,43). A Korean case-control study,
including 213 cases and an equal number of controls, also
reported an inverse association between tofu intake and risk of
gastric cancer (OR: 0.2; 95% CI: 0.1,0.8) (43); however, in a
prospective study of 38,576 Japanese atomic-bomb survivors, no
signiﬁcant inverse association between tofu and gastric cancer
was found (15). A Japanese cross-sectional study reported an
inverse association between tofu and H. pylori infection (P-trend
= 0.01), although no clear explanation was suggested (38). A
Japanese prognosis study of gastric cancer reported that frequent
intake of tofu decreases the HR for gastric cancer death (HR:
0.65; 95% CI: 0.42, 0.99) (42). Soy also contains a variety of
bioactive components,
including saponins, trypsin inhibitors,
phytic acid, protease inhibitors, and isoﬂavones (44). The
contents of the components in tofu are reduced during the
processing of soy beans to tofu, though quantiﬁcation studies of
isoﬂavone isomers have reported that tofu contains similar
amounts of isoﬂavones as soy milk and miso and represents the
major source of isoﬂavones among soy foods (45,46).

When we stratiﬁed by menopausal status in women, dry bean
intake was also inversely associated with the risk of distal gastric
cancer. Dry beans are a major dietary source of ﬁber and
ﬂavonols, which may play a protective role against cancers,
including gastric cancer (47,48). Another possible mechanism is
that dry bean consumption was associated with dose-response
reduction in plasma glucose concentration, and the low glycemic
load may reduce the risk of gastric cancer (47,49,50). Dietary
dry beans are also rich in other bioactive constituents that may
have anticarcinogenic properties, including saponins, protease
inhibitor, inositol hexaphosphate, g-tocoperol, and phytosterols
(51), and appeared to modify cell proliferation through apopto-
sis (52).To further explore our study results, we have done
sensitivity analyses to compare the main results with subanalyses
excluding individuals diagnosed within 1, 2, and 3 y of the
baseline survey, and major results were consistent with the
primary analyses (data not shown).

Several characteristics in study design distinguished this study
from previous investigations. We chose to exclude the fermented

soy foods elements from our calculation of soy food intake
because, in general, common fermented soy foods, such as soup
or stew, contain a large amount of salt and lose their beneﬁcial
effects during fermentation or storage (17). Preserved or
fermented soy foods, such as miso soup in Japan and soybean
paste in Korea, contain high concentrations of N-nitroso
compounds (25), which are potential carcinogens for many
primary sites. Moreover, to reduce the misclassiﬁcation of soy
intake group, we estimated the exposure level using the mean of
2 FFQs (53). The correlation coefﬁcient between nonfermented
soy food intakes derived from the 2 FFQs was 0.35, and the
agreement rate of the quartile group of nonfermented soy intake
between the 2 FFQs was 38.0%. Because the water content of
soy foods is relatively high and varies widely (from 96.4% in soy
milk to 10.2% in dry beans), we also calculated dry weights of
each soy food to ascertain the speciﬁc effects of each soy
component. In addition, we restricted ﬁnal outcomes to gastric
cancer developed in the noncardia region. Distal gastric cancer is
localized in the noncardia region and differs from cardia gastric
cancer, which is localized to the gastroesophageal junction, in
etiology and epidemiological characteristics. Another strength
of our study was that our study population in is was well suited
to the study of soy and gastric cancer because of its high
incidence of gastric cancer (1) and dietary habits with frequent
consumption of soy foods (54). Study participants were middle-
aged urban Shanghai residents, who have been shown to have
high participation rates (92.6% and 74.1% in SWHS and
SMHS, respectively) and follow-up rates (91.3% and 81.6% in
SWHS and SMHS, respectively).

This study had some limitations. First, H. pylori status was
not available for inclusion in this study. H. pylori infection is the
strongest risk factor for gastric cancer; however, it is unlikely
that inclusion of H. pylori status of study participants would
have affected our results critically because H. pylori prevalence
is very high in this population (92% and 94% in SWHS and
SMHS participants, respectively) (55,56). Second, our data
might not have been sufﬁcient to detect associations in some
subgroups because of the short follow-up period, particularly for
the men (median 5.5 y), and the relatively low interindividual
variability of soy consumption among the study populations.
Third, possible dietary measurement errors may have caused
modest dietary associations because any dietary changes occur-
ring before the baseline examination and after the ﬁrst follow-up
were not accounted for. Fourth, despite adjusting for several
conventional risk factors and selected dietary factors,
the
likelihood of residual confounding by unadjusted dietary factors
that correlate with soy food consumption could not be
discounted. We also were unable to report on fermented soy
food intake, although consumption of
these foods is less
common in the Chinese population than in other Asian
populations. Finally, our results did not suggest that a linear
association exists between soy food intake and gastric cancer
risk in this population, as we hypothesized. Instead, our results
suggested a dichotomous association, whereby individuals in the
lowest quartile of intake (quartile 1) may be the only ones at
increased risk in this population of generally high soy food
intake. Other unmeasured factors associated with being in
quartile 1 may also have caused this association, resulting in
residual confounding. Overall, we think these limitations would
most likely apply generally to both the cases and controls in this
prospective study, thus attenuating any associations investigated
toward the null.

In summary, the present study found no association between
nonfermented soy food intake and risk of distal gastric cancer

overall, though an inverse association was found for tofu in men
only and dry bean consumption may decrease the risk of gastric
cancer in postmenopausal women. These ﬁndings did not
support
the hypothesis that general consumption of non-
fermented soy food plays a protective role in gastric cancer
etiology.
