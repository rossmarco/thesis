ABSTRACT N-Nitroso compounds are found in the colon and are formed endogenously because amines and
amides are produced by bacterial decarboxylation of amino acids in the large gut. They can be N-nitrosated in the
presence of a nitrosating agent. To test the hypothesis that increased nitrogenous residues from red meat would
increase endogenous N-nitrosation, thus accounting for the epidemiologic association between red meat con-
sumption and colorectal cancer, we fed increased levels of red meat and measured apparent total N-nitroso
compounds (ATNCs) in fecal samples in a series of studies of volunteers maintained under controlled conditions.
A result of these studies is that we have shown a consistent dose response to red meat consumption. Fiber, in the
form of vegetables, bran or resistant starch, does not reduce the level of ATNCs formed, although transit time is
reduced and fecal weight are increased. Here we show that the equivalent amount (420 – 600 g) of meat as white
meat has no effect on fecal ATNCs in 12 volunteers (P ⫽ 0.338). At dosages of 0, 60, 120, 240 and 420 g of red
meat/d, mean levels of ATNC output are highly correlated with dose of meat: for concentration ATNC versus dose
of meat in g/d, r ⫽ 0.972, ␤ ⫽ 0.252 ng/g (SE 0.035); for total ATNC output versus dose of meat in g/d, r ⫽ 0.963,
␤ ⫽ 2.605 ␮g/d (SE 0.419). The effects of nonmeat protein and of heme on increased N-nitrosation and the
genotoxic effects of the ATNCs produced are presently being investigated.

Up to 80% of colorectal cancer cases have been attributed
to diet, suggesting that this cancer, the second most common
in Western countries, is a preventable disease (1). Armstrong
and Doll (2) attributed much of the international variation in
large bowel cancer incidence among countries to dietary dif-
ferences, especially meat and fat consumption. If meat is
associated with increased risk, lower rates for cancer would be
expected in vegetarians; in a meta-analysis of ﬁve cohorts,
non–meat eaters were not at lower risk than meat eaters (3).
However, in the largest study of these vegetarians versus meat
eaters, meat was associated with increased risk of colorectal
cancer (3,4). Two systematic reviews of meat consumption in
relation to colorectal cancer incidence were recently pub-
lished. In 13 prospective studies an increase of 100 g all meat
or red meat was associated with a signiﬁcant 12–17% increased
risk of colorectal cancer, and a signiﬁcant 49% increased risk
was found for a daily increase of 25 g processed meat (5). In 34

case-control studies and 14 cohort studies average relative risk
was 1.35 [conﬁdence interval 3(CI 1.21–1.51)] for red meat
and 1.31 (CI 1.13–1.51) for processed meat (nitrite treated,
cured or smoked, including lunch meats) and meat products
and there was no signiﬁcant association with total meat (6). In
contrast, white meat consumption has been associated with
decreased risk in two prospective studies (7,8).

One explanation for the association between meat and
colorectal cancer is the presence of N-nitroso compounds
(NOCs) formed endogenously within the colon. NOCs are
formed because the amines and amides produced primarily by
bacterial decarboxylation of amino acids can be N-nitrosated
in the presence of a nitrosating agent (9,10). A number of
facultative and anaerobic colonic bacteria can catalyze the
formation of NOCs at optimum pH 7.5 (11–13). In the
anaerobic large bowel, nitrate is reduced during dissimilatory
nitrate metabolism by the colonic ﬂora to nitrite from which
nitrosating agents may be formed. Supplements of nitrate have
therefore been shown to elevate fecal NOCs (14). N-Nitrosa-
tion in the colon has been demonstrated in animals and shown
to be dependent on the presence of gut ﬂora (15).

Meat increases the level of nitrogenous residues reaching
the colon (16) so that meat might be expected to increase
colonic level of NOCs. We previously showed that fecal NOC

We have been unable to show an effect of white meat on
endogenous N-nitrosation but have only studied two individ-
uals so far (17). Hence the effect of white meat in 12 individ-
uals, at two different levels, is reported here. In addition, the
effect of 120 g red meat on endogenous N-nitrosation in nine
volunteers is added to previously published data showing a
dose-response effect to 60, 240 and 480 g of red meat/d (19).

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Subjects and diets. Eighteen healthy male volunteers (aged
24 –74 y) were studied in a metabolic suite. During this time only food
that was provided from a standardized menu of normal food was
permitted to be eaten. All diets were constant in fat and nonstarch
polysaccharide (dietary ﬁber) and adjusted for the energy needs for
each subject with extra bread, low-fat margarine and marmalade.
Energy requirements ranged from 10 to 12.5 MJ/d. In protocol 1,
seven subjects were studied for three 10-d dietary periods of 60 g red
meat, 600 g red meat (as beef and pork) and 600 g white meat (as
chicken, turkey or white cod). In protocol 2, ﬁve subjects were
studied for three 15-d periods. The diets were the same as in protocol
1 except that 420 g red and white meat rather than 600 g was used.
In protocol 3, nine subjects were fed 60 and 120 g red meat for 15 d
each. To equalize the energy content of the diets, a glucose polymer
drink and cream were substituted for meat on the 60- and 120-g diets.
All other items of food on each diet of the protocols were the same.
Deionized water was given throughout for drinking and used in
cooking to keep nitrate intake constant. Diets were randomly as-
signed by using a crossover design and subjects were their own
control. Permission for the studies was given by the Dunn Human
Nutrition Unit and Addenbrookes Hospital ethics committees.

Protocols. All fecal samples were collected and stored at ⫺20°C
except for those collected on days 8 –10 in protocol 1 and 13 and 14
in protocols 2 and 3. These samples were processed to prepare
homogenates within 20 min of excretion. Each sample was diluted

fourfold with ultrapure deionized water, homogenized in a stomacher
(Colworth 3500, Seward) for 20 min and centrifuged at 4500 rpm for
10 min. Each supernatant was ﬁltered, distributed into aliquots and
stored at ⫺20°C. Fecal homogenates were analyzed for NOCs and
nitrite by the release of nitric oxide after chemical denitrosation via
thermal energy analysis (21). NOCs detected by this group-selective
method are referred to as apparent total NOCs (ATNCs). All sam-
ples collected during the study were weighed and radiographed, and
recoveries of radiopaque fecal markers (22) were noted.

RESULTS

In protocol 1, 96% of the total fecal markers administered
were recovered (i.e., 4% of markers were present in specimens
not collected after the experimental period). In protocol 2, the
mean number of markers recovered in the fecal samples by
x-ray analysis was 99.0%, and the mean marker recovery from
each volunteer ranged from 98.8% to 99.2%. In protocol 3,
mean marker recovery was 97.7% (range 99.9 –99.6%).

The mean results for all 12 subjects from protocols 1 and 2
are shown in Table 1. Both the concentration of ATNCs and
the output per day were signiﬁcantly higher when the diets
with 420 – 600 g red meat were fed compared with the diet
with 60 g meat (P ⫽ 0.001, P ⫽ 0.009, respectively). However,
ATNC levels when the diets with 420 – 600 g white meat were
fed were not signiﬁcantly different from the low-meat diet (P
⫽ 0.338 and P ⫽ 0.408, respectively, for concentration and
output per day) and were signiﬁcantly lower than those ob-
tained with the diet with 420 – 600 g red meat (P ⫽ 0.014, P
⫽ 0.009, respectively, for concentration and output).

Figure 1 shows individual values of fecal ATNC concen-
tration as a the percentage change from the 60-g red meat diet.
All subjects increased their fecal ATNC concentration on the
high–red meat diet, but there was a large individual variation
in response. Four
subjects exhibited a fourfold increase,
whereas eight subjects increased levels by 1–2.5 times. ATNC
levels in all subjects decreased on changing from the high–red
meat diet to the high–white meat diet to levels found on the
low-meat diet except for two subjects consuming the 600-g
high–white meat diet in whom levels increased on changing to
the white meat diet.

SUPPLEMENT

fecal ATNC excretion during the study was due to endogenous
intestinal formation. This formation is not due to an increase
in the amount of nitrosating agents, such as nitrate, because
nitrate levels have been kept constant throughout to avoid
interference from this factor. An equivalent amount of protein
as white meat in this study had no effect; therefore increased
endogenous production of nitric oxide from oxidation by nitric
oxide synthase of the extra L-arginine present in the high-meat
diets is unlikely to account for any increase (23). The 420-g
red meat diet would have provided ⬃7.3 g arginine compared
with 1.04 g from the 60-g diet (24).

Despite the consistent response to meat, there is substantial
individual variation in the extent of response (Fig. 1). This
individual variation remains despite the highly controlled
conditions under which studies are carried out. The individual
variation may arise from individual differences in gut ﬂora,
with high responders harboring high populations of nitric
oxide–producing bacteria. Alternatively,
individual differ-
ences in iron or protein absorption would alter the amount of
precursors available for N-nitrosation entering the colon. Iron
is required for nitrate reductase activity, which is responsible
for bacterially mediated N-nitrosation (11–13).

Although red meat resulted in the expected increase in
endogenous N-nitrosation in this study, the same amount of
white meat had no effect in 10 of 12 volunteers; therefore
mean fecal ATNC levels were not signiﬁcantly different from
those found in a diet with 60 g of meat. In vitro work has
shown that the heme proteins myoglobin and hemoglobin in
meat react with nitric oxide under anaerobic conditions to
form nitrosating agents with the ability to nitrosate phenol
(25). Under certain conditions, hemes are known to be nitro-
sated and act as nitrosating agents (26). The formation of
N-nitrosoarginine by heme enzymes under anaerobic condi-
tions was also demonstrated (27). Red meat is a much richer
source of heme iron than is white meat; therefore the lack of
effect of white meat may be due to a comparative absence of
heme. Present studies are investigating the effect of heme on
endogenous N-nitrosation (28).

Many classes of NOC have been identiﬁed, including ni-
trosamines, nitrosamides and nitrosoguanidines, and a number
of these are known to cause DNA damage after the formation
of alkylating agents during NOC metabolism. Methylnitro-
sourea was shown to induce G3 A transitions at codons 12

to 120 g of meat/d (from reference 19 and this study). Eight subjects
were studied at the 0-, 240- and 420-g level, 9 at the 120-g level and 17
at the 60-g level. Mean and SEM bars are shown.

FIGURE 1

Individual changes in fecal ATNC concentration in 12
individuals fed a low-meat (60 g) diet, a high–red meat (420 – 600 g) diet
and a high–white meat (420 – 600 g) diet. Subjects 1–7 were in group 1
(600 g meat), and subjects 8 –12 were in group 2 (420 g meat).

In protocol 3, mean levels of ATNC concentration were
764 ␮g 䡠 kg⫺1 (SD 698) on the low-meat diet and 1164 ␮g 䡠 g⫺1
(SD 1555; P ⫽ 0.205) on the high meat diet. ATNC output on
the low-meat diet was 77 ␮g/d (SD 27) compared with 125
␮g/d (SD 125) on the high-meat diet (P ⫽ 0.209). Figure 2
shows mean values for fecal NOC concentration using com-
bined results from those already published (19) and the results
from these nine individuals studied in protocol 3 (n ⫽ 17 for
the 60-g level). Although differences between the 60- and
120-g levels in protocol 3 were not signiﬁcant, mean levels of
fecal ATNCs on the 120-g red meat diet were intermediate
between those obtained from the 60-g and 240-g diets (Fig. 2).
Mean levels of NOC output were highly correlated with dose
of meat: for ng of ATNCs/g versus dose of g of meat/d, r
⫽ 0.972, b ⫽ 0.252 (SE 0.035), and for ␮g of ATNCs/d versus
dose of g of meat/d, r ⫽ 0.963, b ⫽ 2.605 (SE 0.419).

DISCUSSION

The inﬂuence of red meat on fecal ATNC excretion has now
been shown in more than 50 healthy male volunteers, all of
whom were studied in this study and four previous studies from
our laboratory in a metabolic suite where diet could be carefully
controlled (17–20). The direction of increase with increasing
meat is consistent in nearly all individuals. Furthermore, Figure 2
shows there is a dose response that occurs at normal levels of
120 g of meat/d in addition to the higher levels of 240 and 420 g/d
published elsewhere (19). Under these controlled conditions, the
dose of red meat was highly predictive of average fecal ATNCs,
with R2 values of 0.97 and 0.96 for concentration and output per
day, respectively. At the higher levels of meat consumption,
concentrations of ATNCs are of the same order of magnitude as
the concentration of tobacco-speciﬁc NOCs in cigarette smoke
(11,17). We previously showed that fermentable carbohydrate
does not change fecal NOC output (17,18,20). In this study, the
nonstarch polysaccharide (ﬁber) contents of the diets were the
same and diet had no effect on fecal weight and mean transit time
(Table 1).

A high–red meat diet containing 600 g of meat/d provides
only 13 ␮g of preformed ATNCs/d (18). Fecal ATNC levels
exceeded this value in all subjects studied so far, showing that

and 13 in rat colon tumors and is used to induce colon cancer
in rat models (29). Endogenous N-nitrosation may thus be the
mechanism behind the increased risk of colorectal cancer from
red meat, but further work is required to establish the geno-
toxicity and carcinogenicity of these compounds present in the
colon, especially when large amounts of red meat are con-
sumed.
