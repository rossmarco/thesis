Abstract

Dietary energy restriction (DER) reduces risk of spontaneous mammary cancer in rodents.
In humans, DER in premenopausal years seems to reduce risk of postmenopausal breast
cancer. Markers of DER are required to develop acceptable DER regimens for breast cancer
prevention. We therefore examined markers of DER in the breast, adipose tissue, and serum.
Nineteen overweight or obese women at moderately increased risk of breast cancer (life-
time risk, 1 in 6 to 1 in 3) ages between 35 and 45 were randomly allocated to DER [liquid
diet, 3,656 kJ/d (864 kcal/d); n = 10] or asked to continue their normal eating patterns (n = 9)
for one menstrual cycle. Biopsies of the breast and abdominal fat were taken before and
after the intervention. RNA was extracted from whole tissues and breast epithelium (by laser
capture microdissection) and hybridized to Affymetrix GeneChips. Longitudinal plasma and
urine samples were collected before and after intervention, and metabolic profiles were gen-
erated using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.

DER was associated with significant reductions in weight [−7.0 (±2.3) kg] and in alterations
of serum biomarkers of breast cancer risk (insulin, leptin, total and low-density lipoprotein
cholesterol, and triglycerides). In both abdominal and breast tissues, as well as isolated
breast epithelial cells, genes involved in glycolytic and lipid synthesis pathways (including
stearoyl-CoA desaturase, fatty acid desaturase, and aldolase C) were significantly down-
regulated.

We conclude that reduced expressions of genes in the lipid metabolism and glycolytic
pathways are detectable in breast tissue following DER, and these may represent targets
for DER mimetics as effective chemoprophylactic agents.

Dietary energy restriction (DER) significantly reduces sponta-
neous mammary tumors in laboratory rodents irrespective of
the type of macronutrient restricted (1). Observational studies
indicate that weight loss in premenopausal or postmenopaus-
al women reduces the risk of postmenopausal breast cancer (2,
3). For example, in the Iowa Women's Health Study, women
who lost >5% of their body weight before menopause had
40% fewer breast cancers in the postmenopausal period com-
pared with women who continued to gain weight (2). Post-
menopausal weight loss of >10 kg reduced postmenopausal

breast cancer by 60% in the Nurses' Health Study, and >5%
postmenopausal weight loss in the Iowa Women's Health
Study was associated with a 25% reduction in risk (2, 3). Re-
duction in cancer risk is also seen after weight reduction after
bariatric surgery (4–7). DER is associated with diverse cellular
changes, including alteration of growth factor, signaling and
metabolic pathways, and reduction of cell proliferation (8,
9), in animal studies. DER favorably alters serum markers of
breast cancer risk, such as insulin, leptin, sex hormone binding
globulin (SHBG), and lipids, in women who are overweight or

obese (10–13). A recent study reported changes in the urinary
and serum metabolome of long-term dietary-restricted dogs
(14). Several groups have assessed the effects of energy restric-
tion (1–3) and changes in macronutrient profiles (1, 3) on gene
expression in s.c. abdominal adipose tissue. These studies
were undertaken in obese men and women and were relative-
ly short-term studies with periods of energy restriction of be-
tween 2 and 28 days (2) or of 5 (1) and 10 weeks (3). However,
there has been, to our knowledge, no assessment of breast
gene expression in response to DER (15–18). Of the many gene
changes induced by DER, down-regulation of genes associat-
ed with fatty acid synthesis and desaturation is the most
prominent.

In the study reported here, we sought to assess whether ef-
fects of DER are apparent in breast tissue of overweight and
obese women at increased risk of breast cancer to begin to un-
derstand a possible molecular mechanism for DER in breast
cancer prevention.

Materials and Methods

Subject selection
Nineteen premenopausal overweight or obese [body mass index
(BMI) between 28 and 40 kg/m2] parous women ages between 35
and 45 y at increased risk of breast cancer (estimated lifetime risk, 1
in 6 to 1 in 3; ref. 19) were recruited from our Family History Clinic
and randomized to DER or to continue normal diet (Fig. 1). Other en-
try criteria included a normal mammogram within 24 mo, stable or
increasing weight, and sedentary lifestyle (not participating in >40
min of moderate activity per week). Exclusion criteria included al-
ready losing weight following restrictive diets; taking dietary supple-
ments; recent use of tamoxifen; regular use of anti-inflammatory,
anticoagulant, antiplatelet, or oral contraceptive medication; pregnant
or planning a pregnancy; previous hysterectomy; and serious comor-
bid conditions such as a previous diagnosis of cancer, diabetes, ische-
mic vascular disease, thyroid disease, or psychiatric disorders.
Seventy-eight volunteers were eligible but 59 decided not to partici-
pate, mainly after disliking a 2-d test diet or on learning the invasive-
ness of the protocol. Although the 59 nonparticipating women were
eligible in terms of weight and other criteria, it is unknown how they
compared with participating women for the other characteristics mea-
sured in Table 1. The study was reviewed by the Bolton (Lancashire)
Local Research Ethics Committee (Number 05/Q1409/42). All partici-
pants provided written informed consent before participation.

Study protocol
Breast and s.c. abdominal biopsies and fasting blood and urine
were collected in the follicular phase shortly after the beginning of
menses for two subsequent menstrual cycles to avoid widely fluctuat-
ing hormone levels producing confounding alterations in gene expres-
sion (20). Weight and total body fat (bioelectrical impedence, Tanita
TBF300a), waist, hip, and bust measurements were also measured
on this occasion. Three measurements of waist, hip, and bust size
were made using standardized methods to the nearest 1.00 mm,
and the mean of these measurements was used. Waist was measured
at the level of the umbilicus and hip at the widest point over the
tronchanters. Dietary intake and physical activity for 7 d before each
assessment were assessed from a 7-d diet history and physical activity
recall (21, 22). Energy and macronutrient intake of reported diets were
assessed using the five-diet analysis program (Compeat). After the
first biopsies, participants were randomized to either DER (n = 10)
or a control group (n = 9) who were advised to maintain their usual
eating and exercise pattern. DER consisted of four 325 mL cans of a
commercially available nutritionally complete milk shake (“Slimfast,”
Unilever) and 2 to 3 L of other clear low-energy, high-potassium fluids

Tissue Biomarkers of Energy Restriction

(water, black tea, coffee, low-calorie soft drinks, or stock-based
drinks). Overall, the diet provided on average 3,614 kJ/d (864 kcal/
d); 26% (58 g) of energy was from protein, 62% (97 g) from carbohy-
drate, 12% (26 g) from fat, and 7% (6.4 g) from saturated fat (Fig. 1).
Participants randomized to DER were monitored weekly by the study
dieticians to encourage good compliance, whereas those on their usual
diet were monitored after 2 wk to check that weight was being main-
tained.

Biopsy procedures
Breast. Recent craniocaudal and mediolateral oblique mammo-
grams of each participant were reviewed to assess the pattern of
breast tissue. Biopsies in women with a dense glandular breast pattern
were done under radiographic guidance (n = 7). A single-coned cra-
niocaudal mammogram of the breast was obtained at the time of bi-
opsy and done with the breast immobilized under the compression
device. In women with a diffusely fatty breast pattern (n = 12), biop-
sies were done without radiological guidance. After infiltration of 2%
lidocaine, a small incision was made in the skin at the biopsy site
through which a 14-gauge biopsy needle was inserted to a depth es-
timated by the operator. Between seven and nine biopsy samples were
obtained through the same skin incision, although the direction of the
needle was altered for each sample.

Abdominal fat. Three to five milliliters of s.c. abdominal adipose
tissue were obtained by suction biopsy under local anesthesia from
the anterior abdominal wall, midway between the anterior superior
iliac spine and the umbilicus. The first biopsies were taken from either
the left or right breast/abdominal side chosen by computer random-
ization (independently) and repeat biopsies on the opposite side to
eliminate gene expression changes due to the healing process. One
half of two separate breast cores were fixed in 4% formalin and em-
bedded in paraffin blocks; the remaining tissue was immediately snap
frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C.

Blood measures
Hormone, glucose, and lipid assays, which may be influenced by
DER, were undertaken at the Clinical Biochemistry Department of
South Manchester University Hospital Foundation Trust: glucose
(hexokinase/glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase method; Bayer Di-
agnostics), insulin [electrochemiluminescence immunoassay, Elecsys;
Roche Diagnostics; interassay coefficient of variation (CV), 10.6%], tes-
tosterone (chemiluminescence; Chiron Diagnostics; CV, 6.5%), and
SHBG (noncompetitive IRMA; IRMA-Orion Diagnostica; CV, 8.4%).
Fasting insulin and glucose were combined to calculate the insulin
sensitivity index using the homeostasis model assessment (23). Total
serum insulin-like growth factor-I (enzyme-labeled chemiluminescent
immunometric assay; Diagnostic Products Corp.; CV, 11.3%), serum
testosterone (chemiluminescence), and estradiol (electrochemilumi-
nescence immunoassay) were also measured. Colorimetric enzyme re-
actions were used to measure total cholesterol (CV, 3%), triglyceride
(CV, 5.4%; Bayer Diagnostics), and high-density lipoprotein cholester-
ol (CV, 7.1%; Randox); the levels were measured spectrophotometri-
cally by an automated Olympus AU600 analyzer. The adipokines
leptin and adiponectin and markers of inflammation high-sensitivity
C-reactive protein and sialic acid were determined at MRC Human
Nutrition Research Laboratory (Cambridge, United Kingdom). Plas-
ma leptin concentration was measured using an ELISA method
(Quantikine Human Leptin kit, R&D Systems; CV, 10%), whereas
plasma adiponectin was measured using RIA (LINCO Research,
Inc.; CV, 10%). Sialic acid was assayed using a colorimetric assay
(Roche Diagnostics; CV, 1.2%) adapted for use on the Hitachi 912 Clin-
ical Analyzer (Roche Diagnostics) and C-reactive protein using a high-
sensitivity, particle-enhanced turbidometric assay (CV, 4.5%; Dade
Behring). Serum and plasma samples were aliquoted, stored at −70°
C, and batched so that all samples from a participant were included
in the same assay (24). Laboratory personnel were blinded to the sam-
ple identity. Baseline age, BMI, and body fat and changes in weight,

adiposity, diet and exercise parameters, and hormone and lipid levels
were compared between groups using the Mann-Whitney test using
Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 14 (SPSS, Inc.).

Metabolomics
Serum (in 200 μL aliquots) samples were added to an internal stan-
dard solution (0.174 mg.mL−1 succinic d4 acid, 0.172 mg.mL−1 glycine
d5, and 0.182 mg.mL−1 malonic d2 acid in water) and combined with
600 μL methanol, vortexed for 15 s, and centrifuged (15 min, 13,000 ×
g), and the supernatant was lyophilized (HETO VR MAXI vacuum
centrifuge attached to a HETO CT/DW 60E cooling trap; Thermo Life
Sciences). Urine samples were treated as for the serum, except 100 μL
urease solution (10 mg.mL−1) was added to 75 μL aliquots incubated
at 37°C for 30 min to enzymatically degrade urea and then combined
with 250 μL methanol. Lyophilized samples were chemically deriva-
tized in two stages. 50 μL of 20 mg/mL O-methylhydroxylamine so-
lution in pyridine were added and heated at 40°C for 90 min followed
by addition of 50 μL of N-acetyl-N-(trimethylsilyl)-trifluoroacetamide
and heating at 40°C for 90 min. A retention index solution was added
for chromatographic alignment (20 μL, 0.6 mg/mL C10/C12/C15/
C19/C22 n-alkanes in pyridine). Samples were subsequently analyzed
in a random order using gas chromatography-time of flight-mass
spectrometry (Agilent 6890 GC coupled to a LECO Pegasus III ToF
mass spectrometer) as described previously using optimized settings
for serum (25). Raw data were processed using LECO ChromaTof
v2.12 and its associated chromatographic deconvolution algorithm,
with the baseline set at 1.0, data point averaging of 3, and average
peak width of 2.5. A reference database was prepared, incorporating
the mass spectrum and retention index of all metabolite peaks de-
tected in a random selection of samples so to allow detection of all
metabolites present, whether expected or not expected from the study
of metabolic pathways. Each metabolite peak in the reference data-
base was searched for in each sample, and if matched (retention index
deviation, <±10; mass spectral match, >700), the peak area was re-
ported and the response ratio relative to the internal standard (peak
area-metabolite/peak area-succinic d4 acid internal standard) was cal-
culated. These data (matrix of N samples × P metabolite peaks) repre-
senting normalized peak lists were exported in ASCII format. The

serum and urine data (analyzed separately) were split into DER
and control groups for analysis with a two-sided paired Wilcoxon
signed rank test for each metabolite using the null hypothesis that
the difference (DER versus normal eating habits) in metabolite level
comes from a continuous, symmetrical distribution with a median
value of zero (26). Each significant (P < 0.05) metabolite was com-
pared with its receiver operating characteristic for differentiating
DER from controls.

RNA extraction
RNA was extracted from breast tissue using a protocol devised
by M. Dowsett and A. Kendall (27). Briefly, 20 to 50 mg of breast
tissue were ground to a fine powder under liquid nitrogen; RNA
was isolated with 600 μL of Qiazol reagent (Qiagen Ltd.), which
was passed through a commercially available RNA shearing de-
vice (QiaShredder, Qiagen); and 200 μL chloroform was added, in-
cubated at room temperature for 5 min, and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm
for 15 min. The aqueous phase was removed to a clean tube and
350 μL of 70% ethanol were added. The mixture was placed in an
RNeasy Micro column (Qiagen) and the protocol for the RNeasy Mi-
cro kit was followed to completion. Abdominal adipose tissue total
RNA was isolated using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the
method described by Chomczynski and Sacchi (28). RNA samples
were purified using RNeasy Mini columns (Qiagen) according to
the manufacturer's protocols. RNA concentration and quality was
assessed using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Tech-
nologies) and Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies).
All whole tissue samples yielded RNA in sufficient quantity and
quality for microarray analysis. Total RNA (2 μg) from abdominal
tissue was processed according to the standard Affymetrix protocol
for one-cycle target labeling to produce labeled cRNA. Total RNA
(10 ng) isolated from the breast tissue core biopsies was amplified
using a poly(A) PCR exponential amplification method based on
the techniques described by Brady et al. (29) and Iscove et al.
(30), which allow very small starting amounts of total RNA to be
used. Samples were then hybridized to HGU133 Plus2 GeneChips
(Affymetrix).

Laser capture microdissection
Before laser capture, frozen sections were fixed and areas of interest
were stained using the Arcturus Histogene frozen section staining kit
(KIT0401), as per manufacturer's instructions. The laser capture micro-
dissection was done on the Arcturus XT System. Microdissection was
done by laser pulses activating a thermoplastic polymer film attached
to an inverted CapSure “cap,” which then expands and surrounds the
cells of interest, allowing removal. Following cell capture, RNA was
extracted and isolated using the Arcturus PicoPure RNA isolation kit
(KIT0202) as per manufacturer's instructions. RNA was amplified us-
ing the Nugen WT-Ovation Pico System RNA amplification kit (Nu-
gen), labeled, and hybridized to Affymetrix U133 Plus2 GeneChips as
described in full on our Web site.6

Microarray analysis
After scanning, array images were assessed by eye to confirm scan-
ner alignment and the absence of significant bubbles or scratches on
the chip surface. Ratios (3′/5′) for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehy-
drogenase and β-actin were confirmed to be within acceptable limits
(0.86-1.38 and 0.70-1.24, respectively), and BioB spike controls were
found to be present on all chips, with BioC, BioD, and CreX also pres-

ent in increasing intensity. All microarray data are MIAME compliant
and accessible via MIAME VICE.7 Gene expression data were ana-
lyzed using packages within Bioconductor8 (31) implemented in the
R statistical programming language. The gene expression data were
normalized using the GeneChip Robust Multi-array Average algo-
rithm (32) within the “simpleaffy” package (33) and then compared
using multiclass significance analysis of microarrays (SAM; ref. 34) us-
ing the siggenes package. Baseline and repeat biopsies were paired
and analyzed in the DER group and control group separately. The
gene ontologies of significantly differentially expressed genes were ex-
amined using the GoMiner9 software (35).

Results

Ten women were randomized to DER, and 9 to their normal
diet (median ages, 42.4 and 41.8 years, respectively), and medi-
an study periods were 26.2 and 26.9 days for the DER and con-
trol groups (Fig. 1). No woman withdrew from the study at any
point. The biopsies were tolerated well, with no adverse side
effects other than bruising at both the breast and abdominal

sites. The energy-restricted diet was well tolerated. The com-
monest side effects were constipation of variable degree (n =
6), eased in all cases by increasing intake of clear fluids, and
halitosis (n = 5), which resolved by improving oral hygiene
and was likely due to the thick texture and sugar content of
the drink. There were no significant differences at baseline
between the DER and control groups with respect to weight,
BMI, body fat, calorie intake, dietary macronutrient compo-
sition, serum hormones, glucose, or inflammatory markers
(Tables 1 and 2).

Change in anthropometry, hormones, and lipids
Compliance to the dietary regimens seemed to be good be-
cause all 10 women in the DER group lost weight (median loss
of −7.0, ±2.3); in contrast, women in the control group showed
minor fluctuations in weight with a median gain of 0.3 (±1.5).
Fat mass, fat free mass, waist, hip, and bust measurements de-
creased significantly in all of the women in the DER group;
there was no change in these parameters in the control group
(Table 1). As expected, the level of total and low-density lipo-
proteins, cholesterol, triglyceride, and leptin fell significantly
and SHBG rose significantly in the DER group (Table 1).
Women in both groups were sedentary and remained so
throughout the study (Table 2).

Metabolomics
Of the 253 derivatized metabolite peaks detected, 83 could
be definitively identified by matching the retention index
(±10) and mass spectral match (>700) of metabolite in sample
to an authentic metabolite standard analyzed on the same an-
alytic system. In addition, 49 were identified on a preliminary
basis by matching (match >700) of mass spectrum only to me-
tabolites present in available mass spectral libraries (NIST/
EPA/NIH02 library and the publicly available MPI-Golm li-
brary).10 The metabolites that were significantly changed in
plasma and urine for DER participants compared with con-
trols are illustrated in Fig. 2 and were consistent with known
effects of calorie restriction. A significant increase in glycolic
acid in urine correlates with the reduction in glycolytic genes
and increased lipid oxidation (Fig. 3). Increased urea and re-
duction in available amino acids, serine, and glycine in blood
is concordant with the breakdown of proteins due to calorie
restriction. There was also an increase in adipic acid and 3-
hydroxybutanoic acid in urine following DER, suggesting in-
creased lipid oxidation and the formation of ketone bodies.
Observations of participants, however, suggested they were
not ketotic, and the odor of ketones was not detectable on
their breath. The low-energy diet chosen in this study was
not expected to be ketogenic, containing 138 g/d of carbohy-
drates, which is far in excess of the minimum dietary intake of
50 g/d required to prevent ketosis (36).

Microarrays were done on all breast and abdominal fat sam-
ples at time zero and after 1 month. In the control group, no
probe sets were found to be consistently differentially ex-
pressed between baseline and repeat biopsies in either breast
or abdominal adipose tissue using SAM software. Seventy-

two probe sets (representing 61 genes) were differentially ex-
pressed between baseline and repeat biopsies in the breast tis-
sue in the DER group [with a false discovery rate (FDR) of
0.38], whereas 200 probe sets (representing 161 genes) were
differentially expressed between baseline and repeat biopsies
in the abdominal adipose tissue in response to DER (with a
FDR of 0.01; full lists in Supplementary Tables S1 and S2).
Choosing a lower FDR for the breast tissue resulted in no
consistently significant genes being identified (due to greater
tissue heterogeneity); conversely, a higher FDR for the ab-
dominal tissue resulted in almost a quarter of the genes pres-
ent on the array to be called significant. To ensure that the
amplification step used for the breast tissue did not affect
our findings, we also amplified RNA from the abdominal ad-
ipose tissue from three participants before and after DER and
hybridized the samples to Affymetrix GeneChips; >90% of
the top 200 probe sets identified using SAM analysis re-
mained the same.

Many more genes were down-regulated than up-regulated
with DER (56 of 61 in the breast and 113 of 161 in adipose tis-
sue). Of the 61 genes significantly altered in the breast (Sup-
plementary Table S1), 11 were also significantly altered in
adipose tissue; several of these were represented by more than
one probe set, showing reproducibility, although P values
were lower for the abdominal tissue (Table 3). The most
down-regulated genes in the breast [stearoyl-CoA desaturase
(SCD), fatty acid desaturase 1 (FADS1), transferrin, and aldolase
C (ALDOC)] were among those shared with adipose tissue.
Other genes down-regulated in the breast were osteonidogen,
transmembrane protein 135, mitochondrial carrier triple repeat 1,
and hexokinase 2; the most down-regulated genes unique to ad-
ipose tissue were ELOVL family member 6 elongation of fatty
acids, secreted frizzled related protein2, cholesteryl ester transfer
protein, and plasma and collagen type II α1 (Table 3).

Gene ontology and pathway analysis
Genes differentially expressed in both breast and abdominal
tissue following DER were most frequently related to metab-
olism and energy pathways, with approximately one third of
gene ontology terms common to both tissues (Supplementary
Tables S3 and S4). Looking at genes within the highlighted
pathways using GenMAPP,11 it was clearly seen that almost
all the individual genes involved in the glycolysis, tricarbox-
ylic acid cycle, electron transport chain, and fatty acid metab-
olism were down-regulated in both adipose and breast tissue
following DER. Many of these genes were significantly differ-
entially expressed (P < 0.05). Several gluconeogenesis genes
were up-regulated and genes within the fatty acid β-oxidation
pathway were both up-regulated and down-regulated (sum-
marized in Fig. 3).

Expression of epithelial genes in the breast tissue
Epithelial-specific genes (keratin 14, keratin 18, CD24, and
SC38GB202) were expressed at high levels in all 38 breast sam-
ples but were low or not expressed in abdominal adipose tis-
sue (Fig. 4), suggesting that some epithelium was present in all
breast tissue hybridized to GeneChips. The expression of eight
epithelial genes was also assessed by quantitative reverse

transcription-PCR in the four quadrants of each breast from
four women undergoing bilateral risk reduction mastectomy.
Although there was some variation between sides, the differ-
ences between individuals were significantly greater, suggest-
ing relatively lower heterogeneity between contralateral
breasts in individuals (Supplementary Table S5).

Laser capture microdissection was then used to isolate
breast epithelial cells from fixed frozen tissue, and sufficient
RNA for GeneChip analysis was obtained from three matched
samples before and after DER. The majority of expression
changes for the highlighted DER genes were consistent be-
tween the microdissected epithelium and whole breast tissue
for this limited number of samples. Using the MAS5 normal-
ization method (37) to estimate whether particular probe sets
are expressed (called “present,” rather than absent), we deter-
mined that 93% (67 of 72) of the DER breast probe sets were
called present using MAS5 normalization in at least three of
the six microdissected samples. Just 2 of the 72 DER breast
probe sets representing ABCC6 and LOC389393 were not
called present in any of the epithelial-only samples (Supple-
mentary Table S1). Using the same method, we also confirmed
expression of >80% of the 72 DER breast genes in the ducts
and lobules of at least half of the normal breast tissue sam-
ples isolated by laser capture microdissection in a study pub-
lished by Turashvili et al. (Supplementary Table S1; ref. 38),
suggesting that DER-regulated genes are expressed in breast
epithelium.

Discussion

Because studies in rodents and observational studies in
women indicate that DER reduces the risk of mammary can-

cer, we designed the study reported here to determine poten-
tial biomarkers of the effect and effectiveness of DER in
women at increased risk of breast cancer (1–5). DER (∼60%
normal diet) was sufficient to favorably change known se-
rum/urine biomarkers of breast cancer risk (insulin, leptin,
and SHBG). Gene expression in breast tissue was also altered
following DER, with some changes consistent with those in
the adipose tissue. The metabolomic results seem to corrobo-
rate the changes in metabolic pathways seen at the gene ex-
pression level.

The tissue composition of the breast is variable and
changes with age and during pregnancy. In parous women
ages 35 to 45 years, it is estimated that the breast comprises
10% to 20% epithelium, with 60% to 80% fibroconnective
tissue and 10% to 20% adipose tissue (39, 40). The propor-
tion of adipose tissue is likely to be higher in overweight
and obese women, such as those who were eligible for this
study. It is not clear from our study whether the changes in
gene expression common to the breast and abdominal tissue
following DER affect the breast adipose tissue or breast ep-
ithelium directly. However, our limited laser capture micro-
dissection study of pure epithelium and analysis of the
RNA suggested a direct effect of DER on epithelial gene ex-
pression. A study of biopsies of normal breast tissue before
and after letrozole showed multiple gene changes, but these
investigators were also unable to distinguish between stro-
mal and epithelial changes because of paucity of the latter
(27). Further studies are required to establish tissue-specific
gene expression changes within the breast.

The four most down-regulated genes in the breast were also
down-regulated in abdominal adipose tissue, and three of the
genes were related to the metabolic pathways of fat synthesis

(SCD and FADS) and glycolysis (ALDOC). SCD has been
shown to be a highly down-regulated gene in s.c. adipose tis-
sue in several DER studies (15, 16, 18). SCD is the gatekeeper
to the formation of unsaturated fatty acids because it intro-
duces a double bond in the 9 position in the saturated fatty

acids stearate and palmitate to form monounsaturated fatty
acids oleic and palmitooleic acids. SCD-deficient mice are lean
and have reduced lipid synthesis and enhanced lipid oxida-
tion and insulin sensitivity (41). SCD knockdown reduces pro-
liferation and Akt phosphorylation in cancer cell lines (42, 43).

Glycolysis, the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, electron

down-regulated (long dashes) and gluconeogenesis
was up-regulated (short dashes). Genes involved
with fatty acid β-oxidation were both up-regulated
and down-regulated. Italics, enzymes that were
down-regulated by SAM analysis in our study.
Superscript numbers represent the tissue in which
down-regulation occurred: 1, breast tissue; 2,

Inhibition of SCD by stearic acid reduces N-nitrosomethylurea–
induced mammary tumor development in rats. A high unsat-
urated to saturated fat ratio in red cell membranes or serum
phospholipids (indicating low SCD activity) is associated with
reduced risk of breast cancer (44, 45). Thus, low SCD activity
in the breast may not only be a marker of the effectiveness of

DER but also an indicator of reduced risk of breast cancer and
a target for energy restriction mimetic agents (46).

We studied the effects of DER on a relatively homogenous
group of women who were all of similar weight and age
and were all parous. All biopsies, serum, and urine samples
were taken at about the same day of each menstrual cycle

under standardized, fasting conditions to limit variance. The
inclusion of a control group allowed us to assess any
changes in gene expression, which may be influenced by
the site or timing of biopsies. The lack of changes in gene
expression in the control group gives confidence that the
changes observed following DER are “real” and indicates
the stability of gene expression when diet and exercise are
unchanged. To maximize compliance and standardize die-
tary change, the DER comprised a liquid meal replacement
drink (Slimfast). The declines in body fat (−4.6 kg over 26
days) among the DER group are consistent with ∼1,400
kcal/d energy deficit, indicating good compliance to the
DER regimen (47). The clear effect of DER on body weight,
fat, and lipids and leptin confirms that compliance was at a
sufficient level to have metabolic effects and reflects the suc-
cess of our rigorous selection process. DER is well known to
cause declines in leptin (15) and SHBG (48). The decline in
total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycer-
ides is consistent with previous studies of low-fat, energy-
restricted regimens (49, 50).

The DER regimen used in our study reduced energy in-
take (67%) but also resulted in differential reduction of
macronutrients from the woman's standard diet of calories
from carbohydrate (53% reduced), protein (43% reduced),

and fat (89% reduced). It is possible that some of the changes
seen in this study were due to altered composition of the
diet, specifically the greatly decreased fat intake. It is known
that an isocaloric dietary change of macronutrients, such as
the combined requirement of carbohydrate and saturated fat
for induction of SCD in humans (18), can alter urinary me-
tabolomic patterns and gene expression in s.c. fat. However,
several studies show that DER produces changes in gene
expression, which are greater than changes in diet macronu-
trient composition (15–18). We believe that further metabolo-
mic studies are warranted to assess relative importance
between fat and carbohydrate to energy restriction. Some ob-
servational studies show a modest reduction of breast cancer
risk after reduction of fat intake, but a large randomized trial
of isocaloric fat reduction was not associated with risk reduc-
tion (51, 52).

Opposite breasts were sampled 1 month apart to circum-
vent potential inflammatory changes if biopsies had been tak-
en from one breast only. This is a potential weakness of the
study given the known heterogeneity of the breast and may
account for some of the changes seen. However, no consistent
differences in gene expression were seen in the controls in the
biopsies taken from contralateral breasts 1 month apart, and
quantitative reverse transcription-PCR assessment of eight

epithelial-specific genes from the four quadrants of each breast
from four women undergoing bilateral risk reduction mastec-
tomy suggested greater variation between individuals than
between breasts.

A higher FDR (0.3) was used to identify the most consistent-
ly changed genes in the breast tissue following DER compared
with the adipose tissue (0.01). We have postulated that is due
to greater heterogeneity of breast tissue compared with that of
the abdominal adipose. Alternatively, it could be an indication
that the response to DER in breast tissue is simply more var-
iable than the response in adipose tissue. Although the P va-
lues shown in Table 2 are not as low for the breast tissue as
they are for the adipose tissue, they are still highly significant.
Furthermore, gene ontology analysis identified many of the
same pathways for both tissues and almost all genes within
these were down-regulated (Supplementary Fig. S1). It would
be interesting to compare gene expression in breast adipo-
cytes, epithelium, and stroma separately; however, this ap-
proach would result in a much lower tissue to RNA yield
and therefore necessitate a more invasive biopsy technique.
However, we were able to do laser capture microdissection
of sufficient epithelium in three before and after DER samples
to obtain RNA and analyze gene expression. This revealed
similar changes in genes, such as SCD, to those seen in whole
tissue, suggesting that DER does affect breast epithelial gene
expression.

Previous studies have examined the effect of DER on s.c.
abdominal fat. Our findings are largely concordant with
those of other human studies. Notably, fatty acid synthesis
genes are down-regulated in the adipose tissue of both this
study (60% DER over 1 month) and the previous Affymetrix
array–based study of Dahlman et al. [30% DER over 10
weeks (15) and 50% DER over 5 weeks (18)], although this
article did not specify these specific metabolism genes. Other
studies have linked a 30% DER over 10 weeks with changes
in the expression of genes that encode transporters and tran-
scription factors linked to adipogenesis and mitochondrial
respiration (17). Clement et al. (53) reported that ∼60% of
genes differentially expressed in a 60% DER study over
1 month in s.c. adipose tissue were related to fat and carbo-
hydrate metabolism, although this group focused mainly on
inflammation-related genes. A recent study reported that ep-
ithelial cells from chemical-induced mammary adenocarcino-
mas from Sprague-Dawley rats had increased expression of
genes for glycolysis, decreased pyruvate dehydrogenase, and
increased lactate dehydrogenase compared with normal epi-
thelial cells, consistent with the Warburg effect (54). Howev-
er, this pattern of gene expression was not influenced by a
40% DER. The design of this study does not enable the ef-
fects of DER on spontaneous development of breast cancer
to be determined; furthermore, changes in lipid metabolism
were not reported (55). Adipocytes and breast epithelial cells
lie in close proximity to each other in breast tissue. Large
adipocytes in obese subjects may have dysregulated secre-
tion of factors (i.e., increased leptin and decreased adiponec-
tin), which may promote the proliferation of transformed
ductal carcinoma cells (56). DER resulted in significant re-
ductions in serum levels of leptin (66%) but no change in
serum adiponectin. Serum changes in leptin were not re-
flected in leptin gene expression. The dissociation between
adipokine gene expression and serum levels has been noted

Tissue Biomarkers of Energy Restriction

in earlier studies, suggesting a lack of sensitivity or post-
translational effects of DER (57). There have been few meta-
bolomic studies of DER in humans. We did not detect
significant changes in glycolysis (glucose-6-phosphate and
pyruvate) and tricarboxylic acid cycle metabolites (succinic
acid and 2-oxoglutaric acid) despite these pathways being
down-regulated at the gene expression level. However, the
small sample sizes would preclude the detection of small dif-
ferences in the concentrations of these metabolites.

The exact mechanism for the protective effect of DER
against cancer remains unknown. Increased glycolysis and
fatty acid synthesis is well described in tumors, and there
is renewed interest in inhibition of these pathways not only
for cancer treatment but also for prevention of cancer and
other diseases (see ref. 9 for review). For example, inhibition
of glycolysis with two deoxyglucose or fatty acid synthases
with a compound named C75 inhibits tumor growth in
rodent and human models (58, 59), whereas indirect obser-
vational evidence (increased stearic to oleic acid ratio in
RBCs) is consistent with SCD activity linked to breast cancer
risk (45).

This is a short-term study, and it is difficult to draw any
firm conclusions about the effects of long-term DER. It is un-
known which changes persist in the long-term when finally
a desirable weight is achieved and weight stabilizes. In com-
mon with our study, most previous reports have assessed
changes in gene expression during energy restriction and
the dynamic phase of weight loss (16, 53). One report finds
that most changes observed during dynamic phase of weight
loss were reversed or attenuated during a 5-week weight sta-
bilization phase (18). The beneficial changes in gene expres-
sion seen with weight loss are therefore mostly linked to
energy restriction. Periods of intermittent restriction may
thus be required to maintain these beneficial effects (10). En-
ergy restriction is known to reduce cell proliferation and
increase apoptotic rate in both normal tissues and cancers
(60–63). The inhibition of glycolysis has been shown to im-
pair the growth of tumor cells (64, 65), and suppression of
glycolysis and fatty acid synthesis specifically in the breast
epithelium may prevent breast carcinomas from developing
and progressing.

In summary, we have done the first DER study to character-
ize gene expression changes in premenopausal normal human
breast tissue. Common differentially expressed genes and
pathways in breast and abdominal tissue suggests that
short-term energy restriction may influence breast cancer risk
at the molecular level. We have identified targets that may re-
spond to chemoprophylactic mimetic agents.
