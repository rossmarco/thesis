abstract

background
The influence of excess body weight on the risk of death from cancer has not been fully
characterized.

methods
In a prospectively studied population of more than 900,000 U.S. adults (404,576 men
and 495,477 women) who were free of cancer at enrollment in 1982, there were 57,145
deaths from cancer during 16 years of follow-up. We examined the relation in men and
women between the body-mass index in 1982 and the risk of death from all cancers
and from cancers at individual sites, while controlling for other risk factors in multivari-
ate proportional-hazards models. We calculated the proportion of all deaths from can-
cer that was attributable to overweight and obesity in the U.S. population on the basis of
risk estimates from the current study and national estimates of the prevalence of over-
weight and obesity in the U.S. adult population.

results
The heaviest members of this cohort (those with a body-mass index [the weight in kilo-
grams divided by the square of the height in meters] of at least 40) had death rates from
all cancers combined that were 52 percent higher (for men) and 62 percent higher (for
women) than the rates in men and women of normal weight. For men, the relative risk
of death was 1.52 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.13 to 2.05); for women, the relative
risk was 1.62 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.40 to 1.87). In both men and women,
body-mass index was also significantly associated with higher rates of death due to
cancer of the esophagus, colon and rectum, liver, gallbladder, pancreas, and kidney; the
same was true for death due to non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and multiple myeloma. Signif-
icant trends of increasing risk with higher body-mass-index values were observed for
death from cancers of the stomach and prostate in men and for death from cancers of
the breast, uterus, cervix, and ovary in women. On the basis of associations observed in
this study, we estimate that current patterns of overweight and obesity in the United
States could account for 14 percent of all deaths from cancer in men and 20 percent of
those in women.

conclusions
Increased body weight was associated with increased death rates for all cancers com-
bined and for cancers at multiple specific sites.

he relations between excess body
weight  and  mortality,  not  only  from  all
causes but also from cardiovascular dis-
ease,  are  well  established.
  Although  we  have
known for some time that excess weight is also an
7
important factor in death from cancer,
 our knowl-
edge of the magnitude of the relation, both for all
cancers and for cancers at individual sites, and the
public health effect of excess weight in terms of to-
tal mortality from cancer is limited.

8-12

11,13,14

Previous studies have consistently shown asso-
ciations between adiposity and increased risk of
cancers  of  the  endometrium,  kidney,  gallbladder
(in women), breast (in postmenopausal women),
and colon (particularly in men).
 Adenocarci-
noma of the esophagus has been linked to obesi-
ty.
 Data on cancers of the pancreas, prostate,
liver, cervix, and ovary and on hematopoietic cancers
are scarce or inconsistent.
 The lack of con-
sistency may be attributable to the limited number
of  studies  (especially  those  with  prospective  co-
horts), the limited range and variable categorization
of overweight and obesity among studies, bias intro-
duced by reverse causality with respect to smoking-
related cancers, and possibly real differences be-
tween the effects of overweight and obesity on the
incidence of cancer and on the rates of death from
some cancers.

We  conducted  a  prospective  investigation  in  a
large cohort of U.S. men and women to determine
the relations between body-mass index (the weight
in kilograms divided by the square of the height in
meters) and the risk of death from cancer at specific
sites. This cohort has been used previously to exam-
ine the association of body-mass index and death
5
from any cause.

methods

study population
The  men  and  women  in  this  study  were  selected
from the 1,184,617 participants in the Cancer Pre-
vention Study II, a prospective mortality study begun
by the American Cancer Society in 1982.
 The
participants were identified and enrolled by more
than 77,000 volunteers in all 50 states, the District
of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. Families were en-
rolled if at least one household member was 45 years
of age or older and all enrolled members were 30
years of age or older. The average age of the partici-
pants at enrollment was 57 years. In 1982 they com-
pleted a confidential mailed questionnaire that in-

20,21

cluded personal identifiers and elicited information
on demographic characteristics, personal and fam-
ily history of cancer and other diseases, and various
behavioral, environmental, occupational, and di-
etary exposures.

Over 99 percent of deaths that occurred from the
month of enrollment until September 1988 were as-
certained by means of personal inquiries made by
22
volunteers in September 1984, 1986, and 1988.
Approximately 93 percent of all deaths occurring
after September 1988 were ascertained by linkage
 By December 31,
with the National Death Index.
1998,  24.0  percent  of  the  participants  had  died,
75.8 percent were still living, and 0.2 percent were
dropped from follow-up on September 1, 1988, be-
cause of insufficient data for linkage with the Na-
tional Death Index. Death certificates or multiple
cause-of-death codes were obtained for 98.8 percent
of all known deaths.

22

In the base-line questionnaire, the participants
were asked their current weight, weight one year
previously, and height (without shoes). We excluded
from  the  analysis  participants  whose  values  for
height or weight were missing, whose weight one
year before the interview was unknown, or who had
lost more than 10 lb (4.5 kg) in the previous year;
65,436 men and 91,282 women were excluded for
these reasons. We also excluded participants with
below-normal weight according to World Health
Organization guidelines
 as indicated by a body-
mass index of less than 18.5 (3393 men and 15,769
women). In addition, we excluded participants who
had cancer (other than nonmelanoma skin cancer)
at base line (20,839 men and 47,120 women) and
those with missing information on race or smoking
history (14,086 men and 26,639 women). The eli-
gible participants for the current analysis included
404,576 men and 495,477 women. After 16 years of
follow-up, there were a total of 32,303 deaths from
cancer in men and 24,842 deaths from cancer in
women in this population.

23

From the final population of 900,053 partici-
pants, we defined a subgroup of those who had nev-
er  smoked  (107,030  men  and  276,564  women).
Within this subgroup, there were a total of 5314
deaths from cancer among men and 11,648 among
women. This subgroup provided us with an oppor-
tunity to evaluate whether the association between
body-mass index and mortality was subject to re-
sidual confounding by smoking status for smok-
ing-related cancers.

body-mass index
The body-mass index, a measure of adiposity, was
categorized as follows: 18.5 to 24.9, 25.0 to 29.9,
30.0 to 34.9, 35.0 to 39.9, and 40.0 or more. These
categories  correspond  to  those  proposed  by  the
World Health Organization
 for “normal range,”
“grade 1 overweight,” “grade 2 overweight” (30.0
to 39.9), and “grade 3 overweight,” respectively.
For many analyses, especially for cancers in spe-
cific sites and among participants who had never
smoked, the upper categories of body-mass index
were combined, because of the small numbers. In
our analyses and discussion, we refer to the range
of 25.0 to 29.9 as corresponding to “overweight”
and to values of 30.0 or more as corresponding to
“obesity.”

In  all  primary  analyses,  the  body-mass  index
category of 18.5 to 24.9 (“normal range”) was con-
sidered  the  reference  group.  We  also  conducted
analyses in which we divided this group into two
categories of 18.5 to 22.9 and 23.0 to 24.9 and con-
sidered the lower category to be the reference group.

24

mortality end points
The end points in our analyses were deaths from all
cancers (codes 140.0 to 195.8 and 199.0 to 208.9 of
International Classification of Diseases,
Ninth Revision
the 
 
[ICD-9])
 and from cancers at selected sites. Spe-
cific cancers accounting for at least 150 deaths in
men and 150 deaths in women included esophageal
cancer (ICD-9 codes 150.0 to 150.9), stomach can-
cer (151.0 to 151.9), colorectal cancer (153.0 to
154.8), liver cancer (155.0 to 155.2), gallbladder
cancer (156.0 to 156.9), pancreatic cancer (157.0 to
157.9),  lung  cancer  (162.0  to  162.9),  melanoma
(172.0 to 172.9), breast cancer in women (174.0 to
174.9), cancer of the corpus and uterus, not other-
wise specified (179 and 182.0 to 182.8), cervical
cancer (180.0 to 180.9), ovarian cancer (183.0 to
183.9),  prostate  cancer  (185),  bladder  cancer
(188.0 to 188.9), kidney cancer (189.0 to 189.9),
brain cancer (191.0 to 191.9), non-Hodgkin’s lym-
phoma (202.0 to 202.9), multiple myeloma (203.0
to 203.8), and leukemia (204.0 to 208.9). All other
specific  cancers  that  contributed  to  total  deaths
from cancer but that caused fewer than 150 deaths
or were coded as unspecified (199.0 to 199.1) were
analyzed as a separate category of “other” cancers.
Approximately 11 percent of cancers in both men
and women fell into the “other” category. Of these,
45 percent had a specific (coded) site and caused
fewer  than  150  deaths  and  55  percent  had  a  site

that  was  coded  as  unspecified.  Data  regarding
cancer  subsites  or  histologic  findings  were  not
available.

information on covariates
Potential  confounders  included  in  data  analyses
were age (in single years), race (white, black, or
other), smoking status (never smoked, formerly
smoked, or currently smokes, with three categories
of cigarettes smoked per day: 0 to 19, 20, and more
than 20), education (less than high school, high-
school graduate, some college, or college graduate),
physical activity (none, slight, moderate, or heavy),
alcohol use (none, less than one drink per day, one
drink per day, or two or more drinks per day), mar-
ital status (not married or married), current aspirin
use (use or nonuse), a crude index of fat consump-
tion (estimated grams per week for 20 food items,
with  the  participants  divided  into  three  roughly
equal groups),
 and vegetable consumption (the
frequency per week of consumption of nine vege-
tables — not including potatoes — with partici-
pants divided into three roughly equal groups), and
status with respect to estrogen-replacement therapy
in women (never used, currently used, or formerly
used).

25

statistical analysis
Age-adjusted death rates were calculated for each
category  of  body-mass  index  and  were  directly
standardized  to the age distribution of the entire
male or female study population. Relative risks (the
age-adjusted death rate in a specific body-mass-
index category divided by the corresponding rate in
the reference category [18.50 to 24.99]) were com-
puted; the 95 percent confidence intervals used ap-
proximate variance formulas.

26,27

We also used Cox proportional-hazards model-
28
 to compute relative risks and to adjust for oth-
ing
er potential risk factors reported at base line. The
Cox models were stratified according to age at en-
rollment by the inclusion of age (in single years) in
the strata statement of the Cox model. The relative
risks we report are from the multivariate Cox mod-
els,  unless  otherwise  noted.  Tests  of  linear  trend
were performed by scoring the categories of body-
mass index, entering the score as a continuous term
in the regression model, and testing the significance
of the term by the Wald chi-square test.

29

We present results for all cancers combined and
for cancer at each site on the basis of analyses of the
total populations of men and women. For most in-

* Participants with any of the following features at study entry were excluded: missing data on height or current weight; unknown weight one 
year before entry; weight loss at least 10 lb (4.5 kg) in the previous year; body-mass index under 18.50; existing cancer (other than nonmela-
noma skin cancer); unknown race or missing data; and missing data on smoking status. RR denotes relative risk, and CI confidence interval.
† The highest body-mass-index category examined varies for cancer at different sites; higher categories have been combined when necessary 

because of small numbers.

‡ The rate per 100,000 is given, standardized to the age distribution of men in the Cancer Prevention Study II.
§ The Cox proportional-hazards model was adjusted for age, education, smoking status and number of cigarettes smoked, physical activity, 

alcohol use, marital status, race, aspirin use, fat consumption, and vegetable consumption.

¶This value is for the 35.0–39.9 and ≥40.0 groups combined and is provided to facilitate comparison with the types of cancer.

dividual cancer sites, the association of body-mass
index and mortality was similar whether the analy-
sis was based on the total population or on the pop-
ulation of those who had never smoked. However,
for several cancers known to be related to smoking,
the association between body-mass index and mor-
tality was substantially different in the total popu-
lation and the population of those who had never
smoked. For these cancers (in men, all cancers, lung
cancer, esophageal cancer, pancreatic cancer, and
other cancers; in women, all cancers, lung cancer,
esophageal cancer, and other cancers), the results
from the population of those who had never smoked
are also presented.

Because weight is a modifiable risk factor, we
calculated the population attributable fraction (also
termed population attributable risk, population at-
30
tributable–risk proportion, and excess fraction),

32

an estimate of the proportion of all cancer deaths in
the United States that might be avoided if the adult
population maintained a body-mass index in the
31
normal range. We used methods derived by Walter
and presented by Kleinbaum et al.
 for a multiple-
category  exposure.  In  this  analysis,  calculations
were  based  on  the  multivariate-adjusted  relative
risks for the total population in the Cancer Preven-
tion  Study  II  and  for  the  population  of  those  in
that study who had never smoked and on preva-
lence estimates of overweight and obesity in U.S.

tional  Health  and  Nutrition  Examination  Survey

weight and obesity that were observed in the cur-
rent study were causal and are generalizable to the

body-mass index and mortality
from cancer in the total population
of men and women
The numbers of deaths among men were sufficient
to permit only the death rates from all cancers to be

examined separately for the two highest body-mass-
index categories of 35.0 to 39.9 and 40.0 or more.
The relative risks of death for these categories, as
compared with the group of men of normal weight
(body-mass index, 18.5 to 24.9), were 1.20 (95 per-
cent confidence interval, 1.08 to 1.34) and 1.52 (95
percent confidence interval, 1.13 to 2.05), respec-

tively (Table 1). We observed significant positive lin-
ear trends in death rates with increasing body-mass
index for all cancers, esophageal cancer, stomach
cancer, colorectal cancer, liver cancer, gallbladder
cancer, pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer, kidney
cancer, non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, multiple myelo-
ma, and leukemia (Table 1). As compared with men
of normal weight, men with a body-mass index of
at least 35.0 had significantly elevated relative risks
of death from cancer, which ranged from 1.23 (95
percent confidence interval, 1.11 to 1.36) for death
from any cancer to 4.52 (95 percent confidence in-
terval, 2.94 to 6.94) for death from liver cancer (Ta-
ble 1). In the total population of men, a significant
inverse association was observed between body-
mass index and death from lung cancer. We did not
find significant associations between body-mass in-
dex and death from brain cancer, bladder cancer,
melanoma, or “other” cancers. Among men within
the normal weight range, those with a body-mass
index  of  23.0  to  24.9  were  not  at  higher  risk  for
death from cancer than the leanest men (those with
a body-mass index of 18.5 to 22.9), and the observed
associations in men were not larger when a leaner
group of men was used as the reference group (data
not shown).

The results for the total population of women
were similar. Women with a body-mass index of at
least 40.0 had a relative risk of death from any can-
cer of 1.62 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.40 to
1.87), as compared with women of normal weight
(Table 2). Significant positive linear trends in death
rates were observed for colorectal cancer, liver can-
cer, gallbladder cancer, pancreatic cancer, breast
cancer, cancer of the corpus and uterus, not oth-
erwise specified, cervical cancer, ovarian cancer,
kidney cancer, non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, multiple
myeloma, and “other” cancers (Table 2). The high-
est relative risk we observed was for death from uter-
ine cancer (relative risk, 6.25 for women with body-
mass index of at least 40.0; 95 percent confidence
interval, 3.75 to 10.42). As in men, a significant in-
verse  association  between  body-mass  index  and
death from lung cancer was seen in the total popu-
lation, which included smokers. Significant asso-
ciations with body-mass index were not observed
for death from esophageal cancer, stomach cancer,
melanoma, bladder cancer, brain cancer, or leuke-
mia. Although the results for total cancer mortality
in women were virtually unchanged when a leaner
reference group was used (body-mass index, 18.5 to
22.9), there were significant differences within the

normal weight range for cancers of the gallbladder,
breast, and corpus and uterus, resulting in larger
elevations in risk for these cancers throughout the
entire range of overweight and obesity as compared
with the leanest reference group (the relative risk of
death from gallbladder cancer for a body-mass in-
dex of at least 30.0 was 2.44 [95 percent confidence
interval, 1.73 to 3.44]; the relative risks of death
from breast and uterine cancers for a body-mass in-
dex of at least 40.0 were 2.32 [95 percent confidence
interval, 1.54 to 3.50] and 6.87 [95 percent confi-
dence interval, 4.09 to 11.55], respectively).

body-mass index and mortality
from cancer in men and women
who had never smoked

The association between body-mass index and death
from  several  smoking-related  cancers  changed
when the analysis was restricted to men who had
never smoked. The positive associations with death
from any cancer, esophageal cancer, pancreatic can-
cer, and “other” cancers were of greater magnitude
among those who had never smoked than in the
total population, and the apparent inverse associ-
ation  with  death  from  lung  cancer  disappeared
(Table 3).

As  in  men,  the  positive  association  between
body-mass index and death from any cancer, esoph-
ageal cancer, and “other” cancers became stronger
when the analysis was restricted to women who had
never smoked, and the seemingly protective effect
of high body-mass index on mortality from lung
cancer  was  attenuated  (Table  3).  Among  women
who had never smoked, the relative risk of death
from any cancer was 1.88 (95 percent confidence
interval, 1.56 to 2.27) for those with a body-mass
index of at least 40.0, as compared with women of
normal weight.

The relative risks of cancers for which we found
significant trends of increasing death rates with in-
creasing body-mass index are summarized for the
highest categories of body-mass index that we were
able to examine in men (Fig. 1) and women (Fig. 2).

population attributable fraction
We  estimated  the  proportion  of  all  deaths  from
cancer in the U.S. population that are attributable
to overweight and obesity to be from 4.2 percent to
14.2 percent among men and from 14.3 percent
to 19.8 percent among women (Table 4). The lower
estimates are based on relative risks for the entire
population, whereas the higher estimates are based

rentheses) and men in the reference category (body-mass index, 18.5 to 24.9). Asterisks indicate relative risks for men

estimates based on relative risks among men and
women who never smoked (Table 4) do not describe
the fraction of deaths attributable to overweight and
obesity  among  this  population  only.  Rather,  they
are estimates of the fraction of deaths attributable
to overweight and obesity in the total U.S. popula-
tion,  on  the  assumption  that  the  relative  risks
among  those  who  never  smoked  offer  the  most
valid estimates of the true effect of overweight and
obesity on mortality from cancer.

discussion

The heaviest men and women (those with a body-
mass index of at least 40.0) in the large cohort we
studied prospectively had death rates from all can-
cers that were 52 percent and 62 percent higher, re-
spectively, than the rates in men and women of nor-
mal weight. This finding is consistent with those of
previous studies, but the magnitude of the effect is
somewhat larger.
 The stronger associations
we found probably reflect our ability to examine
deaths from cancer across a wider range of over-
weight and obesity than has been possible previ-
ously. It is also likely that the stronger associations

7,16,17

seen in our study reflect a greater effect of body-
mass index on mortality than on incidence of cancer
at some sites.
 These risk estimates are proba-
bly conservative, since they are based on the total
population, including current and former smokers.
Among women who never smoked, the relative risk
associated with a body-mass index of at least 40.0
was 88 percent; however, there were not enough
deaths among men in this category for us to deter-
mine the relative risk.

The proportion of all deaths from cancer that is
attributable to overweight and obesity in U.S. adults
50 years of age or older may be as high as 14 percent
in men and 20 percent in women. These estimates
are based on the relative risks in our study and the
current patterns of overweight and obesity in the
United States. Under the assumption that these re-
lations are causal, the public health implications for
the United States are profound: more than 90,000
deaths per year from cancer might be avoided if ev-
eryone  in  the  adult  population  could  maintain  a
body-mass index under 25.0 throughout life.

The International Agency for Research on Cancer
(IARC) has concluded that there is sufficient evi-
dence of a cancer-preventive effect of avoidance of
weight gain for cancers of the colon, breast (in post-

 Our study

Two studies that examined obesity and liver can-
cer found an excess risk in both men and women,
 — a
with relative risks in the range of 2.0 to 4.0
result similar to our findings. Our results and those
 suggest that this
of a prospective study in Sweden
excess risk is higher among men than among wom-
en. Obesity also increases the risk of adenocarcino-
ma of the gastric cardia,
 but the data are lim-
ited and inconsistent for noncardia cancers of the
stomach.
 In an earlier American Cancer Society
cohort, as in our study, mortality from stomach can-
cer  was  associated  with  body-mass  index  among
7
men but not among women.
 This difference may
reflect the greater contribution of the cardia to all
cases of gastric cancer in men than in women. Our
results for cervical cancer are also similar to those in
7
 where-
the earlier American Cancer Society cohort,

as the increased risks observed in two cohorts of
hospitalized patients with a diagnosis of obesity,

Data are scarce on the relation between hematopoi-
etic cancers and body-mass index, and the findings
have not been consistent.

7,16,17,53

Our results are based on data on mortality and
reflect the combined influence of body-mass index
both  on  the  incidence  of  cancer  and  on  survival,
whereas most of the available literature on site-spe-
cific cancers is based on incidence data. Our results
may be influenced by adiposity-related differences
in the diagnosis or treatment of cancer, as well as by
true biologic effects of adiposity on survival. For ex-
ample, adiposity has been shown to be adversely as-
sociated with the incidence of breast cancer, survival

what stronger than those in previous studies of in-

Smoking profoundly alters the relation between
body-mass index and many causes of death. We be-
lieve that public health recommendations regarding
optimal body mass are most valid when they are
based on data from studies of persons who have
never smoked.5,57,58 For smoking-related cancers,
the prospective effects of body-mass index on the
risk of death among smokers cannot be separated
from the prospective effects of smoking — namely,
decreased body mass and increased risk of death.
Previous analyses of the Cancer Prevention Study II
cohort demonstrated that the apparent inverse as-
sociation of body-mass index and mortality due to
lung cancer was incrementally attenuated with in-
creasingly complex statistical control for smoking
in multivariate models, and it disappeared entirely
when the analysis was restricted to those who had
never smoked.59 Thus, for smoking-related can-
cers, we believe that the estimates of relative risk
and population attributable fraction presented for
the total population (Tables 1, 2, and 4) are likely
to be underestimates, whereas those presented for
the population of those who never smoked (Tables 3
and 4) offer the most valid estimates of the true ef-
fect  of  overweight  and  obesity  on  mortality  from
these cancers.

We used self-reported weight and height at study
entry to calculate the body-mass index, a widely used
index of weight adjusted for height.60,61 Although

self-reported weight and height are highly correlat-
ed with measured weight and height,62-64 the small
error  that  exists  is  generally  systematic,  with  an
overestimation of height and an underestimation
of weight, especially at higher weights.62-64 Thus,
our measure of body-mass index probably under-
estimated the true body-mass-index values among
overweight persons. We had no direct measure of
adiposity or of lean body mass and no measure of
central adiposity, such as the waist-to-hip ratio. We
also could not evaluate the effect of weight change
or weight cycling throughout the follow-up period,
and we could not estimate the extent of misclassifi-
cation that weight change might introduce. The as-
sociations observed in this study were not changed
in models that excluded deaths in the first two years
of follow-up.

The large size of our cohort allowed us to inves-
tigate the effect of overweight and obesity on the
occurrence  of  57,000  deaths  from  cancer  among
900,000 men and women who were free of cancer
at base line. Overweight and obesity are associated
with  the  risk  of  death  from  all  cancers  and  with
death from cancers at many specific sites. From our
results, we estimate that 90,000 deaths due to cancer
could be prevented each year in the United States if
men and women could maintain normal weight. It
is unlikely that this goal can be achieved without
concerted effort and substantial investment on the
part of policymakers, educators, clinicians, employ-
ers, and schools to promote physical activity and
healthful dietary practices as a cultural norm.
