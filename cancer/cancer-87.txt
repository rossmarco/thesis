Accruing evidence on beneﬁts of adherence to the Mediterranean diet
on health: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis1,2

Francesco Soﬁ, Rosanna Abbate, Gian Franco Gensini, and Alessandro Casini

ABSTRACT
Background: The Mediterranean diet has long been reported to
be protective against the occurrence of several different health
outcomes.
Objective: We aimed to update our previous meta-analysis of pub-
lished cohort prospective studies that investigated the effects of
adherence to the Mediterranean diet on health status.
Design: We conducted a comprehensive literature search through
electronic databases up to June 2010.
Results: The updated review process showed 7 prospective studies
published in the past 2 y that were not included in the previous
meta-analysis (1 study for overall mortality, 3 studies for cardiovas-
cular incidence or mortality, 1 study for cancer incidence or mor-
tality, and 2 studies for neurodegenerative diseases). These recent
studies included 2 health outcomes not previously investigated (ie,
mild cognitive impairment and stroke). The meta-analysis for all
studies with a random-effects model that was conducted after the
inclusion of these recent studies showed that a 2-point increase in
adherence to the Mediterranean diet was associated with a signiﬁ-
cant reduction of overall mortality [relative risk (RR) = 0.92; 95%
CI: 0.90, 0.94], cardiovascular incidence or mortality (RR = 0.90;
95% CI: 0.87, 0.93), cancer incidence or mortality (RR = 0.94;
95% CI: 0.92, 0.96), and neurodegenerative diseases (RR = 0.87;
95% CI: 0.81, 0.94). The meta-regression analysis showed that sam-
ple size was the most signiﬁcant contributor to the model because it
signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced the estimate of the association for overall
mortality.
Conclusion: This updated meta-analysis conﬁrms, in a larger num-
ber of subjects and studies, the signiﬁcant and consistent protection
provided by adherence to the Mediterranean diet in relation to the
Am J Clin
occurrence of major chronic degenerative diseases.

INTRODUCTION

The Mediterranean diet has long been reported to be the
optimal diet for preventing noncommunicable diseases and
preserving good health (1–3). The Mediterranean-style diet is not
a speciﬁc diet, but rather a collection of eating habits traditionally
followed by people in the different countries bordering the
Mediterranean Sea. The diet refers to a dietary proﬁle commonly
available in the early 1960s in the Mediterranean regions and
characterized by a high consumption of fruit, vegetables, le-
gumes, and complex carbohydrates, with a moderate consump-
tion of ﬁsh, and the consumption of olive oil as the main source of
fats and a low-to-moderate amount of red wine during meals. A

great deal of attention has been given to tools that estimate the
adherence of individuals to the Mediterranean diet because of the
usefulness of these tools to identify the whole dietary pattern
instead of single foods or nutrients (4). Hence, computational
scores have been created and used in several large epidemiologic
studies to seek whether they could be useful to estimate the risk of
disease in the general population (5). Some large epidemiologic
studies conducted in different cohorts evidenced an association
between a greater adherence to Mediterranean diet, a reduced risk
of mortality, and the incidence of major chronic diseases (6–9). In
2008, we performed a meta-analysis that included all cohort
prospective studies that investigated this issue, and we observed
that a 2-point
increase of adherence to Mediterranean diet
conferred a signiﬁcant protection against mortality, the occur-
rence of cardiovascular diseases, and major chronic degenerative
diseases (3). However, the previous meta-analysis is 3 y old, and
more prospective cohort studies have since been published.

Therefore, the aim of this study was to update our previous
systematic review and meta-analysis conducted in cohort pro-
spective studies that investigated the effects of adherence to
Mediterranean diet on several health outcomes and to use these
data to conduct a meta-regression analysis to explore a potential
source of heterogeneity in studies.

METHODS

Literature search

According to the statement of the Preferred Reporting Items for
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (10), we systematically
searched published cohort prospective studies that investigated
the association between adherence to the Mediterranean diet and
health outcomes in electronic databases: MEDLINE (source:
PubMed, 1966 to June 2010; www.pubmed.com), EMBASE (1980
to June 2010; www.embase.com), Web of Science (isiweb
ofknowledge.com), The Cochrane Library (source: The Cochrane

Central Register of Controlled Trials, 2010, issue 2; www.the
cochranelibrary.com/), clinicaltrials.org, and Google Scholar
(scholar.google.com). Relevant keywords relating to the Medi-
terranean diet in combination as MeSH terms and text words
(“Mediterranean diet,” or “diet” or “dietary pattern” “Mediterra-
nean,” or “adherence” or “score” and their variants) were used in
combination with words relating to health status (“health,” or
“mortality” or “morbidity,” or “cardiovascular diseases,” or
“neoplastic diseases,” or “cancer,” or “neoplasm,” or “de-
generative diseases,” or “Alzheimer’s disease,” or “Parkinson’s
disease,” or “cerebrovascular disease,” or “dementia,” or “cog-
nition disorder,” or “stroke,” or “outcome,” or “prospective,” or
“follow-up,” or “cohort” and their variants). The search strategy
had no language restrictions. References from the extracted articles
and reviews were also consulted to complete the data bank. When
multiple articles for a single study were present, we used the latest
publication and supplemented it, if necessary, with data from the
most complete or updated publication.

Study selection

We identiﬁed studies that prospectively evaluated the asso-
ciation of an a priori score used for assessing adherence to
Mediterranean diet and adverse clinical outcomes. We excluded
studies if they had a cross-sectional or case-control design, if they
analyzed adherence to a nonspeciﬁc dietary pattern or to a rec-
ommended dietary guideline and not to Mediterranean diet, if
they evaluated cohort of patients who suffered from a prior
clinical event (ie, in a secondary prevention), if they did not adjust
for potential confounders, and if they did not report an adequate
statistical analysis.

Data extraction

Two investigators (FS and AC) assessed potentially relevant
articles for eligibility. The decision to include or exclude studies
was hierarchical and initially made on the basis of the study title,
then of the study abstract, and ﬁnally of the complete study
manuscript. Two researchers independently completed searches,
identiﬁcation of studies, data abstraction, and tabulation, and
discordances were resolved by discussions. The following base-
line characteristics were extracted from the original articles by
using a standardized data extraction form and included in the
meta-analysis: lead author, year of publication, cohort name,
country of origin of the cohort, sample size of the cohort, number
of outcomes, duration of follow-up, age at entry, sex, outcomes,
components of the Mediterranean diet adherence score, and
variables that entered into the multivariable model as potential
confounders (Table 1).

Outcomes of interests were overall mortality, mortality and/or
incidence from cardio- and cerebrovascular diseases, mortality
and/or incidence from cancer, and incidence of neurodegenera-
tive diseases.

Quality assessment

Study quality was assessed according to the following criteria:
1) number of study participants, 2) duration of follow-up, and 3)
adjustment for potential confounders. Studies with a high
number of participants, long duration of follow-up, and adjust-

ment for confounders that include demographic, anthropometric,
and traditional risk factors were considered of high quality.

Statistical analyses

We used the Review Manager program (RevMan, version
5.0.18 for Macintosh, 2008; The Cochrane Collaboration,
Copenhagen, Denmark) and the Statistical Package for Social
Sciences software (SPSS, version 18.0 for Macintosh; SPSS,
Chicago, IL) to pool and analyze results from the individual
studies. The methods and results of all recently identiﬁed cohort
prospective studies were added to the previous table, and data
were formally combined. Pooled results were reported as relative
risks (RRs) and presented with 95% CIs with 2-sided P values by
using a random-effects model (DerSimonian and Laird method)
and the general variance-based method. P , 0.05 was consid-
ered statistically signiﬁcant. When available, we used the results
of the original studies from multivariate models with the most
complete adjustment for potential confounders; the confounding
variables included in the analyses are shown in Table 1.

Statistical heterogeneity was evaluated by using the I2 statistic,
which assessed the appropriateness of pooling the individual
study results. The I2 value provided an estimate of the amount of
variance across studies because of heterogeneity rather than
chance. Where I2 was .50%, the heterogeneity was considered
substantial. A small study bias or publication bias was appraised
by visual inspection of the funnel plot of effect size against the
SE and, analytically, by the Egger’s test. Moreover,
to in-
vestigate possible sources of heterogeneity across studies, we
performed a meta-regression analysis to investigate the effects
of various characteristics of studies on the study estimates of
RRs.

RESULTS

The updated search from recent years resulted in the identi-
ﬁcation of 7 additional prospective studies (11–17) published up
to June 2010 that were not identiﬁed and included previously.
Characteristics of these recent studies are displayed in Table 1. Of
these, 1 study presented the overall mortality as a clinical out-
come (14), 3 studies presented the incidence and/or mortality
from cardiovascular diseases (13, 15, 16), 1 study presented the
incidence and/or mortality from neoplastic diseases (17), and 2
studies presented the incidence of neurodegenerative diseases
(11, 12). Notably, 2 of the 7 studies reported clinical outcomes not
previously investigated, such as mild cognitive impairment and
stroke (12, 13). On the other hand, one study was an updated
analysis of a study already reported in the previous meta-analysis
for the overall mortality outcome;
therefore, only the most
updated study was added to this updated ﬁnal analysis (14). Taken
altogether, a total of 18 cohort prospective studies were included
and entered into the ﬁnal analysis. As a whole, the updated
analysis determined a study population that reached a total of
2,190,627 subjects analyzed. Included samples ranged in size
from 161 to 485,044, with a follow-up time that ranged from 4 to
20 y.

Considerable variations among studies were observed in the
number of participants, sex and age of participants, length of
follow-up, and dietary components used to measure the adher-
ence score to the Mediterranean diet. Studies conducted in

UPDATED META-ANALYSIS ON MEDITERRANEAN DIET

1193

European countries increased to 9 studies (50% of the total
number of studies included).

By grouping the studies according to the different clinical
outcomes, the overall mortality did not change for the number
of studies evaluated (ie, 9 studies that included an updated
analysis of the Greek cohort of the EPIC (European Prospective
Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition) with a total of 514,118
subjects and 34,322 deaths, whereas a consistent increase of
studies and subjects analyzed for the other clinical outcomes
has been reported. Indeed, cardiovascular mortality and in-
cidence were consistently augmented by the number of studies
and subjects analyzed, with a total of 7 cohorts, 534,064
subjects, and 8739 deaths or incident cases. Similarly, the
mortality from and incidence of neoplastic diseases reached
1,006,410 subjects and 11,378 events, whereas the number of
studies that evaluated the association between adherence to the
Mediterranean diet and neurodegenerative diseases increased
from 3 to 5 cohorts, with a total of 136,235 subjects and 1074
cases, including an additional clinical outcome such as mild
cognitive impairment.

from and incidence of neoplastic diseases (Figure 3), a greater
adherence to the Mediterranean diet still determined a signiﬁ-
cant amount of protection, with a similar extent than that of
previous meta-analysis (RR = 0.94; 95% CI: 0.92, 0.96; P ,
0.00001) and again no signiﬁcant heterogeneity (I2 = 6%; P =
0.38). The results of the previous meta-analysis were also
conﬁrmed for the occurrence of neurodegenerative diseases
(Figure 4), which extended to mild cognitive impairment, with
a 13% reduced risk of individuals who most adhered to the
Mediterranean diet (RR = 0.87; 95% CI: 0.81, 0.94; P ,
0.00001) and no signiﬁcant heterogeneity across studies (I2 =
0%; P = 0.73).

Publication bias

The funnel plots of effect sizes compared with SEs that were
performed to investigate possible publication biases were sym-
metric for all different clinical outcomes, which suggested the
absence of possible publication biases.

Meta-analysis

Meta-regression analysis

Meta-analytic pooling under a random-effects model con-
ﬁrmed the already reported signiﬁcant association between a 2-
point increased adherence to the Mediterranean diet and a reduced
risk of mortality from all causes (RR = 0.92; 95% CI: 0.90, 0.94;
P , 0.00001) (Figure 1) with no evidence of statistical
heterogeneity across studies (I2 = 33%; P = 0.15). When studies
that evaluated different clinical outcomes were grouped, we
observed that a 2-point increase of adherence to the Mediter-
ranean diet still remained associated with a reduced risk of
mortality from and incidence of cardiovascular diseases (RR =
0.90; 95% CI: 0.87, 0.93; P , 0.00001) (Figure 2), which
showed no signiﬁcant heterogeneity across studies (I2 = 35%;
P = 0.15). Likewise, in studies that investigated the mortality

Finally, to investigate the effects of various study character-
istics on the study estimates of the RRs, we conducted a meta-
regression analysis by grouping studies according to some
characteristics, such as the number of subjects studied, number of
cases observed, country of origin of the patients, age of the
patients, and length of follow-up. The sample size of the included
studies was the only contributor to the protection compared with
the overall mortality (b = 0.059 6 0.018; P = 0.013) in the
present model. By plotting the estimates of associations for
overall mortality with the number of subjects analyzed for each
study, it was shown that the average protection compared with
the overall mortality was reached with studies that investigated
.2000 subjects (Figure 5).

DISCUSSION

In this updated meta-analysis of prospective studies that in-
vestigated the association between adherence to the Mediterranean
diet and health status, ﬁndings were pooled from .2 million
subjects and 50,000 deaths or incident cases from any causes and/
or from any cardiovascular, neoplastic, and neurodegenerative
diseases. We conﬁrmed the results of our previously published
meta-analysis, which suggested a signiﬁcant protection against
major chronic degenerative diseases for subjects who reported
a greater adherence to the Mediterranean diet (3). Indeed, a 2-
point increase of adherence to the Mediterranean diet signiﬁcantly
determined a 8% reduction of death from any causes, a 10% re-
duction from death and/or incidence of cardio- and cerebrovas-
cular diseases, a 6% reduction from death and/or the incidence
of neoplastic diseases, and a 13% reduction of the incidence of

neurodegenerative diseases. Furthermore, in this updated meta-
analysis, which included 7 articles published in the past 3 y that
could not be considered in the previous meta-analysis, some other
clinical outcomes, such as stroke and mild cognitive impairment,
were included, and a meta-regression analysis to investigate the
possible role of confounding factors was also conducted.

Several studies over the past decades showed the Mediterra-
nean diet to be signiﬁcantly associated with different health
outcomes, such as a favorable health status, better biochemical
proﬁle, and quality of life (1–3, 26, 27). Accordingly, over-
whelming evidence on the health effects of such a dietary proﬁle
has been reported in many different study cohorts by stimulating
both scientiﬁc and lay communities to promote this dietary
pattern as
the ideal dietary pattern for preventing non-
communicable diseases (3, 27).

In this context, with the aim of identifying a practical tool to
estimate how populations follow the guidelines of Mediterranean
diet, adherence scores were computed (4). Many different scores
were created and tested in different study cohorts, but the most
important was deﬁnitely that created in 1995 and developed in
its ﬁnal form in 2003 by Trichopoulou et al (6, 18). In their
studies, which investigated the Greek cohort of the EPIC study,
Trichopoulou et al showed, for the ﬁrst time to our knowledge,
a signiﬁcant association between an increase of such an adher-
ence score and the reduction of overall mortality. Subsequently,
many studies that used this kind of epidemiologic approach have
been released by extending the evidence to many different health
outcomes (3).

The results of the ﬁrst meta-analysis published in 2008, which
comprised a total of 12 studies and .1.5 million subjects, were
that a 2-point increase of score that estimated adherence to the
Mediterranean diet signiﬁcantly determined protection com-
pared with premature death and various diseases. In the past 3 y,

the interest of researchers on this issue rose, and a total of 7 new
cohort prospective studies were added to the literature (11–17).
On the other hand, the issue has been shown to be of extreme
interest for the general population as well as for health admin-
istrators and governments for better tailoring their prevention
strategies and policies.

The present updated meta-analysis has some advantages with
respect to the previous one: ﬁrst, it present, to out knowledge, the
most comprehensive and updated assessment on this issue, with
inclusion of new studies and an update of previously reported
studies; second, the association between the Mediterranean diet
and health outcomes was extended to other relevant disease states
that were not previously investigated, such as stroke and mild
cognitive impairment. These clinical outcomes are of clinical
relevance for the ever-increasing age of the general population.
Third, it reinforces the ﬁndings that a slight increase of the
adherence score to the Mediterranean diet, as was observed by an
increase of 2 points of the adherence score, is signiﬁcantly

updated meta-analysis, we performed a meta-regression analysis
to give deeper insight into the nature of the association between
the adherence score and health status. The meta-regression
analysis showed that studies with larger study populations were
more signiﬁcantly associated with a lesser degree of heterogeneity
and a higher estimate of association. In particular, studies with
populations of .2000 subjects seemed to be more signiﬁcantly
related to the mean outcome observed in the meta-analysis. This
ﬁnding could be easily explained by the increased power of the
studies related to the higher number of subjects analyzed.

information,

In contrast, although we believe that

this updated meta-
analysis provides useful
the ﬁndings must be
interpreted with caution because of some weaknesses. First, the
short interval of time that passed from the ﬁrst meta-analysis and
the present meta-analysis, as well as the not so high number of
new studies, did not allow us to be conﬁdent that these updated
data can be used for all studied outcomes. Second, the use of
meta-analysis technique to evaluate the protection of a dietary
pattern, such as the Mediterranean diet, compared with the oc-
currence of several and different diseases can lead to an over-
estimation of the results. Third, the transferability of such an
adherence score to the general population and the day-to-day
clinical practice is not free of practical problems. The adherence
score’s ease of use is low because the method of calculation
implies the analysis of raw data that comes from a cohort study,
and the real amount of each food category to consume is not
established. Some relevant differences among the studies are
present, and the transferability to the clinical practice is difﬁcult
to understand. However, with the use of such meta-analyses, we
are able to understand the real estimate of the association between
the adherence score to the Mediterranean diet and health status
and to stimulate the interest of researchers to make uniform and
standardize, if possible, the score and its components.

In conclusion, we updated the results of our previous meta-
analysis and were able to conﬁrm the estimates of the association
of adhering to the Mediterranean diet in terms of protection
against overall mortality and incidences of various chronic de-
generative diseases, with an extension of the ﬁndings to some
other health outcomes such as stroke and mild cognitive im-
pairment. Moreover, the results of the meta-regression analysis
indicated that the number of subjects enrolled in a population
study is the most important contributor to the statistical model of
association. These results will likely help researchers and health
administrators to better tailor forthcoming studies in the ﬁeld of
nutrition and public health.
