Abstract

Background: Few prospective studies have examined the preventive role of fruit and vegetable intakes against cancer in

Asian populations.

Objective: This prospective study evaluated the associations between total fruit intake, total vegetable intake, and total

fruit and vegetable intake and total cancer incidence and mortality.

Methods: This prospective cohort study included 14,198 men 40–59 y of age enrolled in the Seoul Male Cohort Study

from 1991 to 1993. Fruit and vegetable intakes were assessed by a validated food-frequency questionnaire. We used Cox

proportional hazard regression models to compute RR ratios and 95% CIs.

Results: During the follow-up period from 1993 to 2008, 1343 men were diagnosed with cancer, and 507 died of cancer. Total

vegetable intake was linearly associated with cancer incidence but was nonlinearly associated with cancer mortality; by comparing
$500 g/d with <100 g/d of total vegetable intake, the multivariable-adjusted RR for total cancer incidence was 0.72 (95% CI: 0.58,
0.90; P-trend: 0.02; P-nonlinearity: 0.06). For total cancer mortality, the multivariable-adjusted RRs comparing 100 to <200 g/d, 200
to <300 g/d, 300 to <500 g/d, and $500 g/d with <100 g/d of total vegetable intake were 0.68 (95% CI: 0.53, 0.88), 0.75 (95% CI:
0.57, 0.98), 0.72 (95% CI: 0.54, 0.95), and 0.67 (95% CI: 0.47, 0.95), respectively (P-trend: 0.09; P-nonlinearity: 0.01). No
associations were found between total fruit intake and total cancer incidence and mortality; $300 g/d vs. <50 g/d, RR: 1.04 (95%
CI: 0.87, 1.25; P-trend 5 0.56) for incidence and RR: 0.89 (95% CI: 0.66, 1.21; P-trend 5 0.71) for mortality.

Conclusions: Our ﬁndings suggest that total vegetable intake is linearly associated with cancer incidence but

nonlinearly associated with total cancer mortality in middle-aged Korean men. However, total fruit intake is not associated
with total cancer incidence or mortality. J Nutr 2015;145:1249–55.

A diet rich in fruits and vegetables has been suggested to
decrease cancer risk, and this hypothesis was extensively

examined in epidemiologic studies in Western populations (1).
In the 1990s, the WHO and the World Cancer Research Fund
and the American Institute for Cancer Research (WCRF/AICR)
emphasized the beneﬁcial effect of fruit and vegetable intake on
cancer prevention because a relatively large number of case–
control studies supported this hypothesis (2, 3). The ﬁrst report
by the WCRF/AICR (1997) concluded that the preventive effects
of high fruit and vegetable consumption against cancer risk were
convincing, showing at least a 20% reduction in total cancer risk
with $400 g/d of fruit and vegetable intake (3). However, the
evidence was limited because most of the reviewed studies were
case–control studies, which are susceptible to recall and selection

bias. Because the cumulative results from prospective cohort
studies have not provided similar evidence of the beneﬁts of fruit
and vegetable intake in cancer prevention as the previous case–
control studies, the second WCRF/AICR report downgraded the
level of evidence for several cancer types from convincing to
probable, limited, or suggestive in 2007 (4, 5–13, 27). Large
prospective studies have shown weaker evidence, such as weak
or null associations (5–8). A meta-analysis that evaluated the
association between total fruit and vegetable intake and colo-
rectal cancer risk showed no overall signiﬁcance (9); however,
the study also suggested that a reduction in risk was consistent
with a 100–200 g/d threshold, and there was no further beneﬁt
of increasing the intake above this level (9). Previous prospective
studies on the relation between total fruit and/or vegetable
intake and total cancer mortality have shown inconsistent
results (10–13).

Fruit and vegetable intake varies markedly across various
geographic locations, and Asian populations are estimated to
consume a diet with a relatively high content of vegetables (14).
To the best of our knowledge, this investigation is the ﬁrst study
to evaluate the associations between total fruit and vegetable
intake (combined and separately) and total cancer incidence and
mortality in a prospective study of middle-aged Korean men.

Methods

Study cohort. The study population consisted of participants in the
Seoul Male Cohort Study, a prospective cohort study designed to
investigate the association between lifestyle and dietary factors and
the incidence and mortality of cancer and additional chronic disease
outcomes (15). Between 1991 and 1993, we mailed a baseline
questionnaire to a random sample of 29,918 healthy men residing in
Seoul who received regular biennial general health screenings in 1990 as
beneﬁciaries of the Korea Medical Insurance Corporation. A total of
14,533 men 40–59 y of age returned the baseline self-administered
comprehensive questionnaires. Of these men, we excluded those who did
not complete the FFQs (n = 4), those who were diagnosed with cancer
before enrolling in the study (n = 22), those who had an implausible total
energy intake (>3 SDs from the log-transformed mean energy intake;
n = 100), or those with missing information about the main exposures
(n = 209). After these exclusions, 14,198 men were included in the
analysis. The Institutional Review Board of the Seoul National
University approved the protocol for this study, and all of the study
subjects provided written informed consent.

Dietary assessment. Habitual dietary intake was assessed at baseline
by using an 84-item self-administered FFQ designed and validated for
use in Korea (16). Participants were asked to report how often, on
average, they consumed food or beverage items during the previous year,
using 3 standard serving sizes. The FFQ included 8 possible responses
about frequency of consumption, ranging from ‘‘never or less than once
per month’’ to ‘‘two or more times per day.’’ Average daily fruit and
vegetable intake (in g/d) was calculated by multiplying intake frequency
(servings of food per day) with serving size (grams per serving), and the
sum was calculated from all relevant items. In the present analysis, we
included 13 vegetables (green vegetables,
lettuce, Chinese cabbage,
boiled vegetables, raw green vegetables, tomato, garlic, onion, ginseng,
kimchi, kimchi soup, white kimchi, or radish or cucumber seasoned with
soy sauce) and 12 fruits (tangerine, orange, peach, apple, plum, banana,
pear, melon, watermelon, strawberry, grape, kiwi). We excluded
potatoes from the vegetable group because of their high-starch and
-protein content (17). Total fruit intake only considered fresh fruit, not
fruit juice.

Assessment of nondietary factors. At baseline, participants com-
pleted a questionnaire on demographics, lifestyle, anthropometry, use of
level,
dietary supplements, medical and family history, educational

socioeconomic status, and occupational factors. BMI (in kg/m2) was
calculated on the basis of directly measuring height and weight collected
during their health examination. Pack-years of smoking were calculated
by multiplying the reported average number of cigarettes smoked per day
by the number of years of smoking and dividing by 20.

Ascertainment of cancers and cause of death. Men were followed
from the date of study entry until the date of cancer diagnosis, date of
death, or the end of follow-up period (31 December 2008). The
incidence of cancer was ascertained through unique 13-digit personal
identiﬁcation numbers in the Seoul Cancer Registry, a population-based
cancer registry, and the National Cancer Registration Program, a
nationwide hospital-based cancer registry (18). Incident cancer cases
were coded and classiﬁed according to the International Classiﬁcation of
Diseases for Oncology, 2nd edition (19) and converted according to the
International Classiﬁcation of Diseases, 10th edition (20). The dates and
underlying causes of death were identiﬁed through data linkage to
Korean death certiﬁcate data (21).

Statistical analysis. We used Cox proportional hazards regression
models to estimate the RRs and 95% CIs of the associations between
total fruit intake, total vegetable intake, and total fruit and vegetable
intake with total cancer incidence. In this prospective cohort study, we
also evaluated site-speciﬁc cancer risks in relation to total combined fruit
and vegetable intake, focusing on the following common types of cancers
in Korean men: stomach, colorectal, liver and bile duct, and lung
cancers. In the cancer incidence analyses, the number of person-years of
follow-up was calculated from the date of study entry until the date of
cancer diagnosis, death, or the end of the follow-up period, whichever
occurred ﬁrst. For total cancer mortality, the number of person-years of
follow-up was calculated from the date of study entry until the date of
death from cancer, death from any other cause, or the end of the follow-
up period, whichever occurred ﬁrst. The participants were classiﬁed into
categories of absolute intake. The following cutoffs were used to identify
the intake categories: <50, 50 to <100, 100 to <200, 200 to <300, and
$300 g/d for fruit intake; <100, 100 to <200, 200 to <300, 300 to <500,
and $500 g/d for vegetable intake; and <200, 200 to <300, 300 to <400,
400 to <600, 600 to <800, and $800 g/d for total combined fruit and
vegetable intake in the main analysis. In analyzing the common site-
speciﬁc cancers (22), we combined the two highest categories of total
combined fruit and vegetable intake because of the small number of
cases. We also chose different intake levels as the reference category
because of the small sample size.

All of the models were stratiﬁed by age at baseline and were further
adjusted for vigorous physical activity (<1, 1–2, or $3 h/wk), total
calorie intake (kcal/d, continuous), alcohol intake ( <0.1, 0.1 to <15, 15
to <30, or $30 g/d), red meat intake (g/d, continuous or missing
indicator), multivitamin use (none, 1–6 times/wk, daily, 2–3 times/d, or
missing), pack-years of smoking (, <0.1, 0.1 to <20, 20 to <40, or $40
pack-years), BMI (<18.5, 18.5 to <23, 23 to <25, $25, or missing),
educational level (less than high school, high school graduate or higher,
or missing), family history of cancer (yes or no), and history of diabetes
or cardiovascular disease at baseline (yes or no). In the additional
analyses, we simultaneously adjusted for total fruit and vegetable intake
in analyzing total vegetable intake or total fruit intake. If needed, missing
indicator variables were used to impute missing responses for each
measured covariate (red meat 0.5%, multivitamin use 2.4%, BMI 0.7%,
education level 2.6%). A test for linear trends across fruit and vegetable
intake categories was conducted by ﬁtting the median value of each
category as a continuous variable in the model and evaluating the
relation by using the Wald test. To examine for a possible nonlinear
relation, we examined the nonparametric regression curve by using
restricted cubic splines. Tests for nonlinearity were performed by using
the likelihood ratio test and comparing the model that only included the
linear term with the model that included the linear and cubic spline
terms. The models were visually inspected by using the restricted cubic
spline graphs (23, 24).

In addition, we repeated the analyses after excluding kimchi (a
traditional fermented Korean dish prepared with cabbage, radishes,
onions, and a variety of seasonings) from the primary analyses. We also

intake and total cancer

We stratiﬁed the analyses for the total combined fruit and vegetable
intake and total vegetable intake by BMI ($25 and <25), smoking habits
(never or ever), or history of diabetes or cardiovascular disease at
baseline (yes and no) and tested the statistical signiﬁcance of the cross-
product terms with an effect modiﬁer variable in the multivariable
models by using the likelihood ratio test. We conducted a sensitivity
analysis by excluding cancer cases or cancer deaths that occurred during
the ﬁrst 2 y of follow-up to examine the possibility of reverse causality.
All of the analyses were conducted with SAS version 9.3 (SAS Institute,
Inc.). All P values were 2-sided and were considered to be statistically
signiﬁcant at a level of <0.05.

Results

The mean intake of total fruits and vegetables was 449.0 g/d
(191.8 g/d and 257.2 g/d of total fruit intake and total vegetable
intake, respectively). During the 15.3 y of follow-up for total
cancer incidence and 15.6 y for total cancer mortality among
14,198 men, we ascertained a total of 1343 total cancer cases
and 507 cancer deaths. Compared with men who consumed
<200 g/d of fruits and vegetables combined, men who consumed
$800 g/d were more likely to be educated, perform vigorous
physical activity, and take multivitamins and were less likely to
smoke and have a history of cardiovascular disease or diabetes
(Table 1). Men who consumed larger amounts of total combined
fruits and vegetables tended to consume more total energy,
alcohol, red meat, ﬁsh, dietary calcium, and dietary ﬁber than
men who consumed smaller amounts of fruits and vegetables.

the multivariable-adjusted RR of

We found a signiﬁcant risk reduction of total cancer incidence
only for 600–799 g/d of fruit and vegetable intake combined
(Table 2);
total cancer
incidence that compared 600–799 g/d with <200 g/d of fruit
and vegetable intake combined was 0.80 (95% CI: 0.65, 0.99;
P-trend: 0.67). To minimize the potential inﬂuence of preclinical
disease on diet, we conducted additional analyses after exclud-
ing 67 men who had a cancer diagnosis within the ﬁrst 2 y of
follow-up. The results were similar to the results of the main
analysis (data not shown). No association was found between

combined total fruit and vegetable intake and the risk of total
cancer mortality ($600 to <800 g/d vs. <200 g/d, RR: 0.79; 95%
CI: 0.56, 1.12; P-trend: 0.80).

After excluding kimchi, which comprised 36.9% of the fruit
and vegetable intake (mean intake: 166 g/d), we found no
associations for total cancer incidence or mortality; $ 500 g/d
vs. <100 g/d, RR: 0.96 (95% CI: 0.80, 1.15; P-trend 5 0.94) for
incidence and RR: 0.84 (95% CI: 0.62, 1.14; P-trend 5 0.49) for
mortality. However, when we analyzed the associations between
kimchi intake and total cancer incidence and mortality, we found
signiﬁcant inverse associations (Supplemental Table 1). The
multivariable-adjusted RR of total cancer incidence that compared
300 g/d with <50 g/d of kimchi intake was 0.73 (95% CI: 0.59,
0.91; P-trend: 0.004). For total cancer mortality, the multivariable-
adjusted RRs that compared 50 to <100, 100 to <150, 150 to
<300, and $300 g/d with <50 g/d of kimchi intake were 0.60
(95% CI: 0.45, 0.79), 0.65 (95% CI: 0.51, 0.84), 0.60 (0.46,
0.79), and 0.67 (95% CI: 0.48, 0.94; P-trend: 0.12), respectively.
The age-adjusted Spearman correlation coefﬁcient between kimchi
and non-kimchi vegetable intake was 0.32 (P < 0.001).

Total vegetable intake, but not

intake, was
associated with a reduction in the risk of total cancer incidence
(Table 3); by comparing $500 g/d with <100 g/d of total
vegetable intake, the multivariable-adjusted RR of total cancer
incidence was 0.72 (95% CI: 0.58, 0.90; P-trend: 0.02, model
2). A reduction in the risk of total cancer incidence was
produced between 100 and 199 g/d in the cubic spline curve,
which corresponded to the results from the multivariable
regression analyses (Figure 1A). For total cancer mortality, the
multivariable-adjusted RRs that compared 100 to <200, 200 to
<300, 300 to <500, and $500 g/d with <100 g/d of total
vegetable intake were 0.68 (95% CI: 0.53, 0.88), 0.75 (95% CI:
0.57, 0.98), 0.72 (95% CI: 0.54, 0.95), and 0.67 (95% CI: 0.47,
0.95), respectively (model 2); both multivariable proportional
hazards models (P-trend: 0.09) and the cubic spline curve (P-
nonlinearity: 0.01; Figure 1B) showed a nonlinear relation
between total vegetable intake and total cancer mortality.

We examined whether the associations between total vege-
table intake (Table 4) and combined fruit and vegetable intake

(yes or no).
3 Adjusted additionally for a baseline history of diabetes or cardiovascular disease (yes or no).

(Supplemental Table 2) varied by BMI, smoking habits, or
history of diabetes and cardiovascular disease at baseline. We
found an apparent inverse association between total vegetable
intake and total cancer incidence and mortality among ever-
smokers, whereas no association was found among never-
smokers (P-interactions were 0.04 and 0.01, respectively).
Among ever-smokers, the multivariable-adjusted RRs of total
cancer incidence and mortality that compared $500 g/d with
<100 g/d of total vegetable intake were 0.73 (95% CI: 0.57,
0.93; P-trend: 0.08) and 0.68 (95% CI: 0.46, 0.99; P-trend:
0.18), respectively. Among never-smokers, the corresponding
RRs were 0.55 (95% CI: 0.28, 1.07; P-trend: 0.09) and 0.58
(95% CI: 0.21, 1.59; P-trend: 0.23), respectively. We found that

the associations between total combined fruit and vegetable
intake and total cancer incidence or mortality did not vary by
these characteristics.

In the site-speciﬁc analysis of common cancers in Korea
(stomach, colorectal, liver and bile duct, and lung cancers), we
did not observe a statistically signiﬁcant inverse association of
total combined fruit and vegetable intake with any speciﬁc
cancer incidence or mortality (Supplemental Table 3).

Discussion

In this prospective study of Korean middle-aged men, we
observed that vegetable intake was linearly associated with a

lower risk of
associated with a lower risk of total cancer mortality. However,
our results did not support a possible beneﬁt of fruit intake in
preventing total cancer. We evaluated the total combined fruit
and vegetable intake and the association with subtypes of major
cancers and found no signiﬁcant inverse associations. However,
because of the small number of deaths, our study might lack
sufﬁcient statistical power to detect a true association. The
results of the present study should be interpreted with caution,
and further studies with larger sample sizes and that include
women are needed to conﬁrm these results.

lycopene, dithiolethiones,

Fruit and vegetable intake is considered to be a likely
protective factor against cancer because of the large number
of beneﬁcial bioactive compounds in fruits and vegetables,
including carotenoids, vitamins C and E, selenium, folic acid,
b-carotene,
isothiocya-
nates, ﬂavonoids, allium compounds, isoﬂavones, protease
inhibitors, and dietary ﬁber. These components may protect
cells against carcinogenesis through antioxidant activity,
modulating the detoxiﬁcation enzymes, stimulating the im-
mune system, transferring the methyl groups in the DNA
methylation, modulating steroid hormone metabolism, and
antiproliferative effects (25, 26).

indoles,

A few prospective studies have examined the association
between total fruit and vegetable intake and total cancer risk(5–
8, 27). The European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and
Nutrition study showed a signiﬁcant linear association but with
a small reduction in the risk of total cancer incidence associated
with total vegetable intake [RR for Q5 ($307 g/d) vs. Q1

(<97 g/d): 0.93; P-trend: <0.001] (5). A similar association was
observed for the association between fruit intake and total
cancer incidence [RR for top quintile ($367 g/d) vs. bottom
quintile (<90 g/d): 0.94; P-trend: 0.006]. In the NIH-AARP Diet
and Health Study, elderly men who consumed large quantities of
vegetables had a slightly lower risk of total cancer incidence than
elderly men who consumed low quantities [RR for top quintile
(1.10–3.25 cup equivalents/1000 kcal) vs. bottom quintile
(<0.44 cup equivalent/1000 kcal): 0.94; P-trend: 0.004] (27).
In this study, fruit intake was not associated with total cancer
risk among men. However, other cohort studies conducted in
Japan, Sweden, and the United States did not ﬁnd any signiﬁcant
associations between total fruit and vegetable intake and total
cancer risk, regardless of whether the intakes were evaluated
separately or combined (6–8). We found that total vegetable
intake was linearly associated with total cancer risk. Several
characteristics of our population may differ from Western
populations, such as low BMI, high rate of smoking, and low red
meat intake, which could yield a clear inverse association with
total vegetable intake, as we observed here. This ﬁnding
warrants further studies. In addition, the differences in the types
and number of food items included in the FFQs, ethnicity, the
proportion of supplement use, measurement error, and the
potential presence of residual or unmeasured confounding factors
could be considered.

A few prospective studies reported the association between total
fruit or total vegetable intake with the risk of cancer mortality. Two
prospective studies have shown that higher vegetable intake
conferred an 8% (12) to 70% (11) lower risk of total cancer

mortality with a linear association. In addition, the European
Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition study found a
10% lower risk of cancer mortality with intake of raw vegetables
but not with cooked vegetables (13). The Shanghai WomenÕs and
MenÕs Health Study (10) reported no evidence of this association. A
study in Japan (12) found a signiﬁcant inverse association between
total fruit intake and cancer mortality, but studies conducted in
China (10) or Europe (13) did not.

We found a lower risk of total cancer incidence and mortality
with kimchi intake. Although the antimutagenic and anticarci-
nogenic effects of kimchi were reported in both in vitro and in
vivo studies (28–31), the effect of kimchi on cancer prevention
remains equivocal because of limited evidence from clinical
trials or epidemiologic studies.

The strengths of this study include the use of a prospective
cohort design and the long follow-up period. The consistent results
between the main analysis and the secondary analysis, excluding
diagnosed cancer cases within the ﬁrst 2 y of follow-up, suggest
that reverse causality is unlikely. We included a Korean population
that consumes many vegetables (32), allowing a large contrast
between total fruit and vegetable intake. To the best of our
knowledge, this investigation is the ﬁrst prospective study to
examine the association of fruit and vegetable intake and total
cancer risk and mortality in Korean middle-aged men. This study
has several limitations. First, we cannot rule out the possibility that
random measurement errors inherent in dietary assessment could
have attenuated the association, although fruit and vegetable
intake was investigated with a validated FFQ. Second, because
dietary intake was assessed only at baseline, any changes in dietary
intake during the follow-up period were unknown, and measuring
long-term usual intake may not be as accurate as the cumulative
average dietary intake (33). However, the average total fruit
and vegetable consumption measured in our study was similar to

1254 Choi et al.

the consumption in middle-aged men in the Korea Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (34), a nationwide dietary survey
conducted among a representative sample of Korean adults. Third,
although we attempted to adjust for important confounders, we
could not rule out the possibility that residual or unmeasured
confounding factors may exist. However, a more pronounced
inverse association among nonsmokers, albeit not statistically
signiﬁcant possibly due to small sample size, compared with past or
current smokers may suggest the possibility of minimal residual
confounding variables that may explain the observed inverse
association between total combined fruit and vegetable intake and
total cancer risk. Although red meat intake was not a confounding
factor in the association between total fruit and vegetable intake
and the risks of total cancer incidence and mortality, we cannot rule
out the possibility that the weak association observed for >800 g/d
could be partially explained by the residual effect of risk factors
correlated with fruit and vegetable intake. Finally, this study
consisted of middle-aged men; therefore, the results may not
be generalized to women.

In conclusion, our ﬁndings suggest that vegetable intake was
linearly associated with a lower risk of total cancer incidence
but was nonlinearly associated with a lower risk of total cancer
mortality. However, our results did not support the association
between fruit intake and total cancer incidence and mortality.
The ﬁndings from our study need to be corroborated in large
prospective studies and in the Korean female population.
