Abstract

Background: Lower levels of global DNA methylation in tissue and blood have been associated with increased cancer

risk. Conversely, cross-sectional analyses of healthier lifestyle patterns have been associated with higher levels of

global DNA methylation.

Objective: In this trial, we explored the associations between changes in lifestyle modiﬁcations (diet, weight loss),

metabolic markers, and global epigenetic biomarkers in white blood cells.

Methods: Study participants were Hispanic, African American, and Afro-Caribbean overweight and sedentary female breast
cancer survivors (n = 24) who participated in a larger randomized, crossover, pilot study of a 6-mo weight loss intervention and

who had available blood specimens. Anthropometric measures, a food-frequency questionnaire, and peripheral blood were

collected at baseline, 6 mo, and 12 mo. Plasma samples were analyzed for metabolic markers (insulin, glucose). We

measured DNA methylation of long interspersed nucleotide element 1 (LINE-1) and satellite 2 by pyrosequencing and

MethyLight, respectively, and global DNA methylation by the luminometric methylation assay (LUMA).
Results: DNA methylation of LINE-1 was statistically signiﬁcantly elevated at 6 mo [75.5% vs. 78.5% (P < 0.0001)] and 12 mo [75.5%
vs. 77.7% (P < 0.0001)], compared to baseline. Over a 12-mo period, changes in percentage body fat and plasma glucose concentrations
were positively associated with LINE-1 DNA methylation (b = 0.19, P = 0.001) and LUMA DNA methylation levels (b = 0.24, P = 0.02),
respectively. Similarly, 12-mo changes in dietary measures such as vegetable (b = 0.009, P = 0.048), protein (b = 0.04, P = 0.001), and
total caloric (b = 0.05, P = 0.01) intake were positively associated with changes in LUMA DNA methylation, as was intake of fruit
positively associated with changes in LINE-1 DNA methylation (b = 0.004, P = 0.02).

Conclusions: Our hypothesis-generating results suggest that lifestyle modiﬁcations may be associated with changes in

global DNA methylation detectable at 6 and 12 mo. These biomarkers may be useful intermediate biomarkers to use in future
intervention trials. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00811824. J Nutr 2015;145:783–90.

to have lower breast cancer survival than non-Hispanic whites,
possibly because of postdiagnosis lifestyle behaviors (1). Al-
though there is conﬂicting evidence, several studies have shown
that changes in dietary patterns and physical activity may improve
breast cancer survival (2–6). However, the biological mechanisms
through which changes in lifestyle behaviors may improve breast
cancer survival are not well understood.

Epigenetic modiﬁcations such as DNA methylation have been
proposed as a biological mechanism by which alterations of
lifestyle including diet and exercise can modify predisposition to
chronic disease (7, 8). DNA methylation involves the addition of

a methyl group at the 5# position of cytosine (5mC)9 in cytosine
guanine dinucleotides (CpGs). Global or genomic DNA meth-
ylation levels refer to DNA methylation levels throughout all
genomic CpG sites (9). Measures of global DNA methylation
biomarkers in peripheral tissue, such as blood, have been shown
to respond to environmental and dietary exposures. Studies have
shown that exposures to chemicals such as benzene, polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbons, persistent organic pollutants, and heavy
metals can affect DNA methylation proﬁles (10–16). Differ-
ences in health behaviors have also been related to differences
in global DNA methylation measures in a small number of
studies (9). Exercise and diet were both investigated in the North
Texas Healthy Heart Study, and increases in long interspersed
nucleotide element 1 (LINE-1) DNA methylation was associated
with higher fruit/vegetable intake and higher physical activity
(17, 18). Speciﬁc dietary changes, such as ﬁsh oil intake, have
been associated with the differential methylation of 27 speciﬁc
CpG sites in a study of the YupÕik Alaskan natives (19). Other
studies have found that increased physical activity during
childhood is associated with higher DNA methylation of
LINE-1; however, increased exercise frequency in the elderly
has been related to lower global methylation as measured by
the luminometric methylation assay (LUMA) (20, 21). Most
studies have found that current smoking is not related to
changes in global DNA methylation, whereas alcohol con-
sumption seems to be related to an increase in DNA methyl-
ation of CpG sites within CCGG sequences, but not in the
LINE-1 promoter region in some studies (11, 12, 18, 22–26).
Similarly, 2 studies found no associations when investigating
BMI and LINE-1 DNA methylation (11, 22), whereas another
study among women found that lower DNA methylation of
LINE-1 was correlated with increased BMI (27). Different
epigenetic biomarkers have yielded differing results when
measuring the effects of environmental exposures and health
behaviors, suggesting that several epigenetic markers should be
investigated when assessing changes because of these environ-
mental and behavioral factors.

In this study, we used anthropometric measures, health
behavior measures, and blood samples collected in a pilot study
of a dietary change and physical activity weight loss intervention
among overweight and sedentary minority breast cancer survivors
(28). We conducted hypothesis-generating analyses to assess the
associations between changes in anthropometric measures, met-
abolic biomarkers, diet, and physical activity with changes in 3
separate measures of DNA methylation that have previously been
associated with environmental and behavioral exposures: global
levels of DNA methylation measured by LUMA and levels of
DNA methylation at the repeated sequences LINE-1 and satellite
2 (Sat2). To our knowledge, this is one of the ﬁrst reports
examining changes in DNA methylation after a lifestyle modiﬁ-
cation intervention.

Methods

effects of a 6-mo weight loss program using physical activity and dietary
change. The study was targeted to Hispanic, African American, and Afro-
Caribbean cancer survivors who met the following eligibility criteria:
aged 21–70 y; diagnosis of stage 0–IIIa breast cancer; no evidence of
recurrent or metastatic disease; completed surgery, chemotherapy, and
radiation therapy at least 6 mo prior; BMI (in kg/m2) >25; sedentary
(deﬁned as physically active to the point of sweating <20 min/wk); not
actively engaged in a weight loss program; nonsmoker; hemoglobin A1c
<8%; blood pressure <140/90; and LDL cholesterol <150 mg/dL). Breast
cancer diagnosis and treatment and all clinical measures were conﬁrmed
by medical record review. Clinical data and blood samples were collected
at baseline, 6 mo, and 12 mo. The current analyses were restricted to the
subset of 24 women who provided buffy coat samples at baseline and 6
and/or 12 mo. For all variables presented in Table 1, we compared values
for women who did (n = 24) and did not (n = 18) provide buffy coat
samples. We found no statistically signiﬁcant differences other than in the
proportion of African American women (33% in subset with samples,
6% in subset without samples, P = 0.03). The Columbia University
Medical Center Institutional Review Board approved the study, and all
participants provided written informed consent in English or Spanish.

Anthropometric measures. Weight and height were measured at
baseline, 6 mo, and 12 mo with use of a calibrated electronic scale (FR
Instruments) and stadiometer (Accustat). Waist and hip circumferences
were measured by trained study staff using a Gulick II tape measure
(Country Technology). Body composition was measured by DXA with
use of the Hologic QDR 4500 densitometer (Hologic). Measurements
were available at baseline, 6 mo, and 12 mo for weight, waist and hip
circumference, and waist-to-hip ratio. Body composition was only
measured at baseline and 6 mo.

Physical activity, dietary, and weight
loss intervention. The
intervention has been described in detail elsewhere (28). Brieﬂy, the
6-mo weight loss program encouraged increasing physical activity to
90 min/wk, reducing caloric intake (1200 kcal/d for 1–2 wk, followed by
1600 kcal/d), and distributing caloric intake as 45% protein/30%
carbohydrates/25% fat. The following daily behaviors were emphasized
to promote adhering to a reduced-calorie diet: eat breakfast, eat 5 small
meals, eat $2 servings fruit, eat $3 servings vegetables, drink 2 L water,
read food labels when choosing foods, and pay attention to intake of
total calories, protein, fat, and carbohydrates.

Dietary assessment. Dietary intake at baseline, 6 mo, and 12 mo was
assessed with use of the Hispanic version of the Block FFQ, which
includes foods commonly consumed by African Americans (29).

Physical activity assessment. Physical activity was assessed with use
of a self-administered adaptation of the Kaiser Physical Activity Survey.
The survey provides global summary activity indexes for housework/
caregiving, active living habits, sports/exercise, and occupation (score:
1–5; 1: low activity, 5: high activity) (30). All 4 indexes were assessed at
baseline and sports/exercise was assessed at 6 and 12 mo.

Serum metabolic marker analyses. Serum samples were analyzed in
batches after all samples were collected. Glucose was measured via an
Integra 400 Plus automated chemistry analyzer (Roche Diagnostics).
RIA was used to measure insulin (Siemens). Insulin resistance was
calculated with use of HOMA-IR (31).

Study design and population. Analyses used data and blood samples
from breast cancer survivors who participated in the parent weight loss
intervention trial, which has been described elsewhere (28). Brieﬂy, a
group of 42 minority breast cancer survivors participated in a random-
ized, crossover, waitlist-controlled pilot and feasibility study to test the

DNA extraction and bisulﬁte treatment. Blood was collected at

analyzed at the completion of the study. Genomic DNA was extracted
from the total WBC fraction by a standard salting out procedure. Aliquots
of DNA (500 ng) were bisulﬁte-treated with the EZ DNA methylation kit
(Zymo Research) following the manufacturerÕs protocol. The DNA was
resuspended in 20-mL distilled water and stored at 220°C until use.

percentage of DNA methylation was expressed as:

The interassay coefﬁcient of variation was 1.5%.

Pyrosequencing for LINE-1 methylation levels was performed with
use of PCR and sequencing primers as previously described (34).
Pyrosequencing was conducted with use of a PyroMark Q24 instrument
(Qiagen) with subsequent quantitation of methylation levels determined
with the PyroMark Q24 1.010 software. Three CpG sites were included in
the analysis. Each set of ampliﬁcations included bisulﬁte-converted
CpGenome universal methylated, unmethylated, and nontemplate con-
trols. The interassay coefﬁcient of variation was 0.67%.

The MethyLight assay was used to determine Sat2 methylation
levels. The MethyLight real-time PCR reactions were performed with use
of sequences of probes and forward and reverse primers of Sat2-M1, as
described by Weisenberger et al. (35). Universal methylated DNA served as
a methylated reference, and an Alu-based control reaction was used to
measure the concentrations of input DNA to normalize the signal for each
methylation reaction also described by Weisenberger et al. (35). Fully
methylated DNA to be used as the fully methylated reference sample, was
obtained by enzymatically methylating DNA extracted from human DNA
methyl transferases double knock-out (DKO) human cell line HCT116
DKO (Zymo Research). Each MethyLight reaction was performed in
duplicate, and the percent of methylated reference (PMR) values represent
the mean. The interassay coefﬁcient of variation was 1.2%. MethyLight
data for Sat2 was expressed as PMR values. The PMR is a relative
quantitative measure, and obtained percentages can be above 100%
considering the variable number of the consensus sequence used as control
and the number of repeats in individual samples.

Statistical analysis. Given the modest changes in health behaviors and
metabolic markers in both arms of the parent study (28), and the relatively
small number of women for whom baseline and follow-up buffy coat
samples were available (n = 24), participant data were analyzed as a cohort.
Paired t tests were performed to compare the baseline values to 6- and
12-mo values for anthropometric measures, health behaviors, metabolic
biomarkers, and DNA methylation measures. For each of the anthropo-
metric measures, health behaviors, and metabolic biomarkers, a generalized
estimated equation (GEE) model with repeated measures nested with
participants was used to examine the effect of its percent change on the
percent change of DNA methylation from baseline to 6 mo and 12 mo.
Each of the GEE models was adjusted by using the baseline value of the
predictor of interest and the randomization arm as covariates. We de-
termined that the randomization arm was a confounder between percent
change of some, but not all, of the predictors of interest and the percent
change of DNA methylation. Confounding was deﬁned as changing the b
estimate for the predictor by >10%. GEE model b estimates are based on
associations with a 1% change in the speciﬁed variable. To increase the
interpretability of results, in the results section we discuss changes in
anthropometric, metabolic biomarker, and dietary measures in terms of
10% changes in the speciﬁed variable. Statistical signiﬁcance was set at
P < 0.05. Analyses were conducted with use of SAS 9.2.

Global DNA methylation and lifestyle changes

785

52 y (range: 35–69 y) and 83% were postmenopausal. Partic-
ipants were 67% Hispanic and 33% African American. On
average, women were 3.4 y postdiagnosis (range: 1.2–9.4 y). Mean
BMI was 32.8 (range: 26.3–43.7). On average, reported caloric
intake was 1250 kcal/d, which is less than the recommended
1600 kcal/d intake for women over age 50 (36), and is likely an
underreporting given that all participants were overweight or
obese at baseline. On average, 38% of reported caloric intake
was derived from fat, which is higher than the recommended
<30% of intake from fat (37). Daily intake of vegetables averaged
1.4 servings/d (;70 g/serving), and, on average, participants
ate fruit 1.4 times/d, indicating that the combined intake of
vegetables and fruit was well below the recommended 5–9
daily servings (37).

Change in anthropometric measures, dietary intake, and
metabolic biomarkers. Mean changes in anthropometric
measures, dietary intake, and plasma metabolic biomarkers
from baseline to 6 and 12 mo have been reported elsewhere for
all study participants. In Table 2, we report results for this study
sample for objective measures including anthropometric and
metabolic markers and subjective measures including diet and
physical activity. During the course of this study, on average,
participants lost ;2% of their body weight from baseline to 6
and 12 mo (both P = 0.01; Table 2). There were corresponding
changes in waist, but not hip, circumference. At 6 mo, there was
a mean percentage loss in body fat of 2.4% (P = 0.03). At 12 mo,
we observed a 10.6% decrease in plasma insulin concentration
(P < 0.01) and an 11.4% decrease in insulin resistance as
assessed by HOMA-IR (P < 0.01). In addition, there was an
increase in the sports/exercise index at 6 and 12 mo (P < 0.001).

Change in DNA methylation biomarkers. DNA methylation
levels for each marker at baseline, 6 mo, and 12 mo are shown in
Table 2. Increases in percent methylation of the repetitive
element LINE-1 were observed from baseline to 6 and 12 mo
(4.2% and 3.0%, respectively; both P < 0.0001). There were no
statistically signiﬁcant differences observed in percent methyl-
ation measured by LUMA or percent methylation of the tandem
repeat Sat2.

Associations between changes in anthropometric mea-
sures, metabolic markers, diet, and physical activity and
changes in markers of DNA methylation. GEE models were
used to estimate the individual effects of changes in anthropo-
metric measures, metabolic biomarkers, diet, and physical
activity on measures of DNA methylation (Table 3). Weight
loss itself was not associated with changes in any of the global
DNA methylation markers. Of the objective measures, changes
in body fat and glucose were associated with changes in
methylation. A 10% decrease in body fat was associated with
a 1.9% (95% CI: 0.8%, 3.1%) decrease in DNA methylation of
the repetitive element LINE-1. We also observed an association
between a 10% increase in glucose with a 2.4% (95% CI: 0.4%,
4.4%) increase in global DNA methylation, as measured by
LUMA. No other associations were observed between changes
in anthropometric or metabolic markers and changes in other
epigenetic biomarkers.

Of the subjective diet and physical activity measures, only
changes in diet were associated with changes in LUMA and
LINE-1, and no other associations were observed. A decrease in
caloric intake of 10% was associated with a 0.48% (95% CI:
0.10%, 0.86%) decrease in DNA methylation. A 10% increase in
servings of vegetables and protein was associated with an

786 Delgado-Cruzata et al.

increase in LUMA DNA methylation of 0.85% (95% CI: 0.01%,
1.7%) and 0.41% (95% CI: 0.12%, 0.70%), respectively. A 10%
increase in the frequency of eating fruit was associated with an
increase in LINE-1 DNA methylation of 0.42% (95% CI: 0.06%,
0.77%).

Discussion

In this study, we evaluated 6- and 12-mo changes in global DNA
methylation in Hispanic, African American, and Afro-Caribbean
breast cancer survivors who were part of a larger study
examining the effects of a speciﬁc dietary change and physical
activity weight loss program among sedentary and overweight/
obese minority breast cancer survivors (28). A decrease in
percentage of body fat, an increase in plasma glucose concentra-
tions, and changes in diet were associated with changes in global
markers of DNA methylation. Although the magnitude of these
associations was small, these results are hypothesis generating
and suggest that changes in diet, body fat mass, and the
subsequent metabolic changes may affect epigenetic biomarkers.
Furthermore, results suggest that DNA methylation biomarkers
may be suitable intermediate biomarkers for lifestyle intervention
trials.

A decrease in global DNA methylation is associated with
increased genomic instability and chromosomal rearrangements
(38, 39), a common biological mechanism in several diseases
including cancer. DNA methylation is a mechanism to suppress
the expression of repetitive and viral DNA sequences that can
affect cell functioning (40). Reduced DNA methylation in WBCs
may be an indicator of systemic hypomethylation and of cumu-
lative environmental impacts. Conversely, an increase in DNA
methylation levels of repetitive elements may have a protective
effect against genomic instability and unwanted chromo-
somal rearrangements (41).

Our ﬁnding that LINE-1 DNA methylation levels increased at
the end of our intervention is supported by recently published
data of a statistically signiﬁcant increase in LINE-1 methylation
resulting from a dietary intervention (42). In the study by
Scoccianti et al. (42), all groups experienced a moderate increase
in LINE-1 DNA methylation levels after 4 wk. However, the
authors found no relation between LINE-1 DNA methylation
and speciﬁc diets, such as one with enriched ﬂavonoids and
isothiocyanates (particularly a cruciferous vegetable-based diet), or
one supplemented with ﬂavonoids (green tea and soy products). A
study by Zhang et al. (17) also found that a high fruit and vegetable
intake was associated with high DNA methylation of LINE-1 in
blood. In addition, higher LINE-1 DNA methylation was found in
individuals with higher exercise levels in the same population (18)
and in other studies (20, 21), suggesting an increase in LINE-1 DNA
methylation might be associated with healthy lifestyle habits. Future
studies are needed to conﬁrm these associations and to understand
the importance of the biological mechanisms at play.

Results of previous studies suggest changes in glucose
concentration can induce epigenetic changes. Increased LINE-1
and global DNA methylation have been associated with higher
glucose concentrations and HOMA insulin resistance, respec-
tively (43–45). In addition, chromatin modiﬁcations (46) and
altered DNA methylation at speciﬁc sequences such as the leptin
and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (CDKN2A) promoters
(47, 48) have also been shown to be related to changes in glucose
concentrations. A study that investigated DNA methyltransfer-
ase levels in a colon cancer cell line found that hypoglycemia
lead to a decrease in the concentrations of this enzyme, and
conversely, studies in mouse cells have shown higher DNA

methyltransferase activity and higher DNA methylation of
cytosines as a result of exposure to increased glucose concentra-
tions, proposing a biological mechanism through which decreases
in glucose can lead to a decrease in overall DNA methylation (48,
49). Our study adds to the growing evidence that suggests glucose
concentrations may result in increases in global DNA meth-
ylation levels; however, unlike previous studies, our ﬁndings were
restricted to measurements by LUMA and not DNA methylation
at repetitive sequences such as LINE-1. This might be due to the
fact that we observed only a small change in glucose concentra-
tions over our intervention period, which might not be enough to
trigger a change in LINE-1 DNA methylation levels. Previous
research investigated DNA methylation of LINE-1 and Alu re-
petitive elements (43–45). To our knowledge, our study is the ﬁrst
to explore a global measure of DNA methylation in association
with variations in glucose concentrations. Our current results
and the published evidence suggest glucose concentrations and
metabolism might play a role in epigenetic changes. However,
additional studies are needed to further explore this association.
In this study we assessed 3 different global epigenetic bio-
markers to investigate differential effects of our intervention on
blood DNA methylation levels. The epigenetic biomarkers used
here target different genomic sequences representing different
biological constructs that possibly respond differently to envi-
ronmental and behavioral changes. We measured global DNA
methylation by the LUMA assay, which targets CCGG se-
quences throughout the genome, and DNA methylation of the

repetitive element LINE-1 and tandem repeat Sat2. CCGG
sequences measured by LUMA account for ;7% of all CpG sites
on the genome and are used frequently as a surrogate measure of
global DNA methylation levels (50–53). However, because it
detects such a small fraction of the overall 5mC content, this
method may underestimate changes in 5mC levels, possibly
explaining why we did not observe an overall change in LUMA
levels at the different time points but detected an association
with individual dietary measures and glucose concentrations.
However, although data are available on the effect of vegetable-
based chemicals increasing DNA methylation markers such as
LINE-1 (42), no data to date support caloric intake changing
DNA methylation or epigenetic modiﬁcations. A previous study
highlighted the high number of promoter sequences covered by
LUMA (54). Therefore, LUMA might provide an indication of
changes in the regulation of expression of speciﬁc genes. The
estimates of the associations between changes in dietary factors
and LUMA measures are statistically signiﬁcant, but quite small,
which raises two additional concerns. First, although we took
precautions when performing laboratory measurements, we
might be observing an effect related to the technical variation of
the assay, which is higher than the observed change. Second, the
biological signiﬁcance of very small changes in DNA methylation
is not known, and, even if these associations exist, their
contribution to the epigenome may be negligible. Overall, we are
cautious in our interpretation of these ﬁndings and believe they
should be investigated in future studies.

Our study has several limitations. The sample size is small,
which limits our ability to detect associations between these
epigenetic marks and lifestyle modiﬁcations. It is also unclear
how the duration of the intervention affects changes in epige-
netic biomarkers. Increases in LINE-1 DNA methylation were
observed at 6 mo after the initiation of the intervention and
persisted to month 12, suggesting stability after the initial
change. However, a longer intervention could provide informa-
tion about the sustained effect of lifestyle changes in blood DNA
methylation levels. An additional limitation is the assessment of
dietary information, which was obtained from a self-reported
questionnaire. As we previously noted about this particular study,
given that the majority of the participants were overweight or
obese and the mean reported caloric intake was 1250 kcal/d, it is
likely that study participants underestimated their dietary intake
(28). Inaccurate reporting at baseline for total caloric intake could
result in an underestimation or an overestimation of mean percent
change at 12 mo, which would affect the association with DNA
methylation. Lastly, a common challenge using total WBCs is the
heterogeneity in cell type composition (55). The relative amounts
of the different blood cell fractions vary across individuals and
might affect global DNA methylation biomarker levels (22).
Therefore, care should be taken when comparing results to other
studies.

Future studies should include a larger sample, with a poten-
tially extended intervention and intermediate monitoring points
to better assess the rate at which changes to epigenetic marks take
place in blood. In addition, it is important to consider that the
changes we expect to observe as a result of dietary interventions

788 Delgado-Cruzata et al.

will not be large and most likely would be cumulative as a result of
additional interactions with environmental, lifestyle, and demo-
graphic factors (56). Despite its limitations, our study contributes
to the growing evidence that suggests that the health impacts of
changes in dietary habits and other lifestyle factors may be
mediated through epigenetic modiﬁcations. Our study provides
preliminary evidence for the use of WBC DNA methylation
biomarkers to monitor lifestyle interventions. However, larger
and longer lifestyle interventions are needed to clearly assess the
effects on global DNA methylation levels.
