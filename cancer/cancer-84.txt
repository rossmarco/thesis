A Meta-analysis of Alcohol
Consumption in Relation
to Risk of Breast Cancer

Matthew P. Longnecker, MD; Jesse A. Berlin, ScD; Michele J. Orza, SM; Thomas C. Chalmers, MD

Epidemiologic findings regarding the relation between alcohol consumption and
risk of breast cancer have been inconsistent. We performed a meta-analysis (a
quantitative review) of the available data. To evaluate whether there was a
dose-response relation between alcohol consumption and risk of breast cancer,
we fitted mathematical models to the pooled data. There was strong evidence to
support a dose-response relation in both the case-control and follow-up epide-
miologic data. Using the dose-response curves that we calculated, the risk of
breast cancer at an alcohol intake of 24 g (1 oz) of absolute alcohol daily (about
two drinks daily) relative to nondrinkers was 1.4 (95% confidence interval, 1.0 to
1.8) in the case-control data and was 1.7 (95% confidence interval, 1.4 to 2.2) in
the follow-up data. We interpret these findings not as proof of causality, but as
strongly supportive of an association between alcohol consumption and risk of
breast cancer.

(JAMA 1988;260:652-656)

ALCOHOL consumption has been in¬
consistently associated with an in¬
creased risk of breast cancer.121 To eval¬
there is evidence to
uate whether
support a dose-response relation be¬
tween alcohol consumption and an in¬
creased risk of breast cancer, we com¬
bined the epidemiologic data and
analyzed it as two data sets—one for
case-control studies and one for follow-
up studies.
METHODS

Original data for inclusion in the
meta-analysis were identified through a
MEDLINE search of literature from
1966 through 1987, supplemented by at¬
tention to all references in the articles
recovered through MEDLINE. Addi¬
tionally, all potentially relevant ab¬
stracts and manuscripts in press of

which the authors were aware were in¬
cluded. Each data item (articles, letters
to the editor, abstracts, and manu¬
scripts in press) was modified before
photocopying so the quality ofthe meth¬
ods and data analysis could be judged
without knowledge of study results.
Specifically, authors' names,
study
sites, dates, distributions of alcohol con¬
sumption among cases and noncases,
relative risks, and language reflecting
the study results were removed. The
criteria for evaluating the quality of the
methods and data analysis in each study
are presented in Table 1. Two investiga¬
tors independently scored the methods
and data analysis sections and settled
differences in conference. Specific de¬
tails ofthe scoring system are presented
in the first footnote in Table 1. The over¬
all quality score assigned to each study
was a weighted average of scores from
the methods and the data analysis sec¬
tions (0.8 x percent of total possible
methods points + 0.2 x percent oftotal
possible data analysis points). Analyses
were performed separately for each of

the two types of study design—follow-
up and case-control—because of our a
priori belief that follow-up studies are,
in general, less subject to bias.
The data in Table 2 were used to de¬
rive pooled estimates of the effect of
alcohol consumption on risk of breast
cancer with a weighted, least-squares
regression model. In the model, the log
of the relative risk of breast cancer (as
adjusted for covariates by the original
in¬
authors) was a function of alcohol
take, controlling for study.
In other
words, the slope of the dose-response
curve (on a log scale) was assumed to be
the same for each study, but the relative
risk of breast cancer at a given level of
alcohol intake was allowed to vary. The
model is specified in the first footnote of
Table 3. Findings from larger studies
were given greater weight in estimat¬
ing the overall effect of alcohol con¬
sumption. The weight given to each rel¬
ative risk in Table 2 was the inverse of
the variance, calculated from the confi¬
dence intervals. The dose-response re¬
lation across studies was examined in
models with both linear and quadratic
terms. Fitted models with and without
quadratic terms were compared using F
tests. Once the best-fitting model was
the analysis was repeated
identified,
with the weight given to each relative
risk altered to reflect the quality score
of the study as well as the inverse vari¬
ance (weight = quality/variance). Addi¬
tional models were used to examine the
relation between quality score and esti¬
mate of alcohol effect. Finally, to evalu¬
ate further the relation between study
results and study quality, the analyses
of case-control studies were repeated
excluding those studies with overall
quality scores in the lowest quartile.

"Highest scores ("favorable") were given when original investigators explicitly supplied information Indicating that
the answer to the criterion question was affirmative. For most criteria, up to 5 points were awarded; for question 6
the maximum was 3 points When the answer to a question was not clearly yes or no, then an Intermediate score
was given. For an answer of unclear/probably yes, 2 points were given, and for unclear/probably no,
1 point was
given; 0 points were given when the answer was clearly no. The total number of points awarded to a given study
was a function of which criteria were applicable and how many points were awarded for each of the applicable
criteria. For example, a case-control study with hospital controls would have a total possible methods score of 48
points (questions 1, 2, 5, 7 through 10, 14, and 15, 5 points each; and question 6, 3 points) and a total possible
data analysis score of 5 or 10, depending on whether a matched study design was used (questions 11 and 15,5
points each). See text for method of calculating overall quality score. Further details of scoring system are available
from the authors.

RESULTS

The readers evaluated 21 articles, ab¬
letters, and manuscripts in
stracts,
press. Studies included in the meta-
analysis are summarized in Table 2 and
are listed in order of decreasing quality
score within type of study design. Five
studies were excluded from the analysis
for the following reasons:
insufficient
data to characterize exposure in terms
of grams of alcohol consumed per
day,17,19,20 insufficient data on relative
risk of breast cancer associated with al¬
cohol consumption,18 and insufficient
data by which to evaluate study quali¬
ty.21 The decision to exclude these stud¬
ies was made without consideration of
the findings.
For each criterion in Table 1, the per¬
centage of studies with the highest pos¬
sible quality score is presented. For ten
of the 15 criteria, more than 50% of the
studies received the highest possible
quality score.
In case-control studies,

three potential sources of bias were fre¬
quently present: a long delay between
diagnosis and interview,
interviewers
who were aware of the case-control sta¬
tus of the persons interviewed, and the
readers' uncertainty that the same ex¬
clusion criteria were applied to cases
and controls. Regarding follow-up stud¬
ies, our readers were unable to say that
the investigator's knowledge of alcohol
consumption did not affect the intensity
ofthe search for disease, and frequently
it was not clear that loss to follow-up
was unrelated to alcohol consumption at
baseline.
In the majority offollow-up studies on
alcohol consumption in relation to risk of
breast cancer, a direct relation is evi¬
dent, as is a dose-response relation. The
results of the case-control studies were
less consistent. Estimates of the effect
of alcohol consumption on risk of breast

cancer

cant
(linear model), the dose-response rela¬
tion was also statistically significant
(P<.05). Addition of the quadratic term
to the follow-up model resulted in a sta¬
tistically significant
in
model fit (P = .03; F = 7.08; and df, 1 and
10). The negative sign of the quadratic
coefficient indicates that the dose-re¬
sponse curve does not continue to in¬
crease linearly on a log scale at higher
doses, but plateaus. A multiple F test22
was used to see if the model with the
dose-response coefficients for alcohol
consumption fit the data significantly
better than the model without these
terms; the dose-response effect was sig¬
nificant (P<.01).
The best-fitting models (as previous¬
ly mentioned) were used to construct
average dose-response curves based on
the data in all studies (Figs 1 and 2). In
the case-control data there is a weak
direct association with risk of breast
cancer at light and moderate alcohol in¬
takes (6 to 12 g/d [0.25 to 0.5 oz/d]—or
approximately one half to one drink dai¬
ly), although the 95% confidence inter¬
vals include 1. At heavier levels of in¬
take (s=24g/d |>1 oz/d]—approximately
two or more drinks daily),
there is a
modest association and the confidence
intervals generally do not include 1. In
the follow-up data, at light alcohol
in¬
take there is again a weak association
with risk of breast cancer; the increase
in risk for moderate and heavy alcohol
intake is greater than that in the case-
control studies.
When the weights given to the results
from each study were changed to reflect
the quality score of the study as well as
the inverse variance, the results of the
linear (case-control) and quadratic (fol¬
low-up) models in Table 3 were essen¬
tially unchanged and the models did not
fit the data more closely.
The meta-analysis of the case-control
data was repeated excluding the studies
in the lowest quartile of quality score.
The coefficients predicted from this
model were not materially different
from those presented in Table 3, and, if
anything, there was a greater slope to
the dose-response curve.
Tb determine whether the slope of
dose-response curve varied by study
quality, models similar to those speci¬
fied in Table 3 were fitted with the addi¬
tion of dose-quality interaction terms.
There was essentially no relation be¬
tween quality score and slope of the

In six case-control studies,1,2,8,9,12,13 the
original authors compared the risk of
breast cancer for those who ever drank
with that for those who never drank.
Using a weighted average of the log
relative risks with inverse variance
weights, the overall estimate of relative
risk of breast cancer for ever consuming
alcohol compared with never was 1.1
(95% confidence interval, 1.0 to 1.2).
COMMENT

In this analysis, several points are
clear. First, at intakes of 24 g/d (1 oz/d)
or more, the data are strongly support¬
ive of an association between alcohol
consumption and increased risk of
breast cancer. Second, at lower levels of
intake there appears to be a weak or
modest association, although the 95%
confidence intervals generally include
1. Third, the evidence in favor of a dose-
response relation between alcohol con¬
sumption and risk of breast cancer is
compelling.
The finding of a pooled relative risk of
1.1 for ever vs never drinking, based on
case-control data, does not alter these
conclusions. Since most women who
drink are light or moderate drinkers,23
the estimate of effect for ever drinking
is close to that expected from the dose-
response curve (Fig 1).
From the distribution of alcohol con¬
sumption among women in the United
States,23 and the previously mentioned
relative risks (Figs 1 and 2), it can be

Even though moderate alcohol con¬

all effect on health of consumption at
that level may actually be favorable.
investigators have reported
Several
that moderate alcohol consumption in
both sexes is associated with a decrease
in total mortality25"27 and with a reduced
risk of hospitalization.28,29 The incidence
of cardiovascular disease is so much
greater than that of breast cancer30 that
the beneficial effect of moderate alcohol
consumption3132 on heart disease domi¬
nates the overall effect. One's particular
profile of breast cancer and cardiovas¬
cular risk factors might influence per¬
sonal decisions regarding alcohol use.
Association does not prove cause and
effect. The presence of a dose-response
relation supports causality; however,
causality is difficult to establish when
the effect is modest.33 There may be
some factor that results in both a ten¬
dency to drink alcohol and a tendency to
develop breast cancer. An experiment
in humans to address this question is not
feasible: women cannot be assigned at
random to alcohol consumption or absti¬
nence for life. Evidence to support a
mechanism in humans is, at this point,
conjectural. Using animal models is one
way to obtain experimental evidence,
but in this instance the method has not
yet been well developed.34 Even if ani¬
mals were used, the results of experi¬
ments may not be generalizable to
humans.

Legitimate questions could be raised
about the usefulness of the system for
scoring the quality of methods in follow-
up studies (questions 12 and 13, Table
1). To answer questions 12 and 13 accu¬
rately, more information on the details
of the conduct of these studies would
have been required. It is likely that
these studies were carried out properly.
The manipulation of the follow-up data
based on quality scores was of limited
value. The variation in quality among
the case-control studies was probably
reflected reasonably well by the scoring
system; inclusion of the quality score in
the weighting system did not affect the
estimate of alcohol effect. A posteriori
refinement of our scoring system might
have resulted in a quality ranking more
in keeping with expectation, but
it
would have been less consistent with
maintaining objectivity.
We note that the association between
alcohol and risk of breast cancer was
stronger in the follow-up data than in
the case-control data; we consider the
former less likely to be biased.
We are not the first to compose a list
of criteria by which tojudge the quality
of nonexperimental epidemiologic stud¬
ies.36 The criteria selected for our list
were chosen with two goals in mind: to
select questions that would reflect the
most crucial determinants of validity
and that would discriminate among the
studies considered. Since the true rela¬
tion between alcohol consumption and
risk of breast cancer in the populations
studied is not known, it is difficult to
assess with certainty the relative im¬
the various potential
portance of
sources of bias. Consequently, the crite-

awarded (for methods least likely to be
biased) represent an opinion. All
re¬
views are based on opinion. A merit of
the meta-analytic approach is that it re¬
quires stating specifically the manner in

data that led to a conclusion.
The results of a meta-analysis may
not be accurate.36 A major source of
bias,
ie, that it is a retrospective re¬
search process, we believe to have been
obviated by the methods used in this
study.37 All potentially relevant papers
were obtained by a thorough search.
The decision to include a study and as¬
sessment ofquality were determined by
two independent observers unaware of
study results and unfamiliar with the
literature on the subject. The quanti¬
tative scale for classifying alcohol
ingestion—on which the statistically
significant dose-response relations de¬
pended—was laid out without knowl¬
edge of the relative risk. The results of
meta-analyses ofexperimental epidemi-
ologic data have been shown to approxi¬
mate those of the "gold standard" of

analytic results are also reasonably re¬
producible.39 Most of the experience
with meta-analysis in the biomédical
field, however, is with randomized con¬
trol trials; examples in nonexperimental
epidemiology are rare. The meta-ana-
lytic approach to nonexperimental data
should be valid, provided that proper
precautions are taken to control bias
and that the statistical methods of anal¬
ysis are appropriate.
The results of a meta-analysis may be
invalid due to publication bias. This oc¬

quality alone, eg, statistical significance

Publication bias may influence the as¬

case-control study in this analysis is the
least supportive of an association.13 This
is consistent with the observation that
in the field of cancer chemotherapy
smaller studies tend to show larger
treatment effects, thus suggesting pub-

lication bias.43 Concern about the possi¬
bility of publication bias led us to search
for unpublished studies. We have been
able to learn of three relevant studies,
one follow-up and two case-control. We
repeated our analyses including the
data from these unpublished studies;
the conclusions were not altered.
In summary, the results of this meta-
analysis are strongly supportive of an
association between alcohol consump¬
tion and risk of breast cancer. The in¬
creased risk that is apparent from these
data should not, however, be consid¬
ered separately from the protective ef¬
fect of alcohol against cardiovascular
disease that is suggested by other stud¬
ies. With each new piece of evidence,
our understanding ofthis subtle—possi¬
bly causal—association will continue to
evolve.
