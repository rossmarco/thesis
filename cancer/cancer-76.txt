Abstract

Regular consumption of energy-dense foods predisposes to obesity and type 2 diabetes, both of which are suggested risk

factors for pancreatic cancer. The aim of this study was to investigate whether energy density of foods is an independent

risk factor for pancreatic cancer. In this population-based case-control study in urban Shanghai, 908 patients with pancreatic

cancer and 1067 normal controls, aged 35–79 y, were recruited. The energy density for overall diet was calculated from food-

frequency questionnaire data. Energy density (adjusted for age, sex, and total energy intake) was signiﬁcantly higher in cases
(6.08 6 0.04 kJ/g) than in controls (5.91 6 0.04 kJ/g) (P = 0.003). Energy density was positively associated with pancreatic
cancer risk (OR: 1.16 per unit increase; 95% CI: 1.07, 1.27; P < 0.001). In adjusted analysis, the risk of pancreatic cancer was
72% greater (OR: 1.72; 95% CI: 1.25, 2.35; P = 0.001) in the highest quintile of energy density compared with the lowest

quintile. In this case-control study, dietary energy density is positively associated with risk of pancreatic cancer. This

association should be further investigated in prospective studies. J. Nutr. 143: 1626–1629, 2013.

Introduction

Pancreatic cancer is one of the most aggressive cancers, with a
median survival time <6 mo (1). The incidence rate of pancreatic
cancer in urban Shanghai increased >2-fold from 1973 to 2000
(2). However, little is known about its etiology and risk factors.
Dietary energy density (DED) is deﬁned as the amount of
energy theoretically able to be metabolized per unit weight of
food (3). High energy density, as demonstrated by both short-
and long-term intervention trials, can lead to increased energy
intake and weight gain (3–5). Wang et al. (6) showed in the large
prospective European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and
Nutrition (EPIC) study that low dietary energy density was as-
sociated with a decreased risk of incident type 2 diabetes, which
may be a potential risk factor for pancreatic cancer (7–10). Low
energy density was also associated with intake patterns charac-
terized by relatively more fresh fruits and vegetables and less
meat and soft drinks (6).

The purpose of this study was to investigate the relation
between DED and the risk of pancreatic cancer in a large-scale,
population-based case-control study in urban Shanghai.

Participants and Methods

Study population. A population-based case-control study of pancreatic
cancer was carried out in urban Shanghai during December 2006-
January 2011. All participants were long-term residents of Shanghai and
between 35 and 79 y of age. Details of the study design and participant
recruitment have been described elsewhere (11). Brieﬂy, 908 incident
cases were recruited via an ‘‘instant case reporting system’’ in 37 urban
Shanghai hospitals. Related hospital records, pathology reports, pathol-
ogy slides, and/or imaging materials (computed tomography and/or
positron emission tomography–computed tomography and/or MRI)
were collected for case ascertainment by a group of local pathological
and clinical experts. Patients with endocrine and other nonadenocarci-
noma tumors (n = 16) were excluded, leaving 892 patients in risk
analyses. At the same time, a total of 1067 controls were randomly
selected from a list provided by the Shanghai Residents Registry, with
frequency matching by 5-y age group (i.e., 35–39, 40–44, 45–49, 50–54,
55–59, 60–64, 65–69, 70–74, and 75–79 y) and sex. The study was
approved by the institutional review boards of the Shanghai Cancer
Institute and Yale University, and written informed consent was given by
all participants.

Assessment of diet. Diet intake information on the most recent 5 y
before the interview was ascertained by using a 107-item validated FFQ
(12,13). The FFQ was developed from a similar dietary questionnaire
used in the Shanghai WomenÕs Health Study and the Shanghai MenÕs
Health Study. The validity of the questionnaire was assessed by the FFQ
and the multiple 24-h dietary recalls. In women, the correlation
coefﬁcients were 0.59–0.66 for macronutrients, 0.41–0.59 for micronu-
trients, and 0.41–0.66 for major food groups (12).

for micronutrients, and 0.35–0.72 for food groups (13). Participants
were asked how often they had regularly consumed each food, on
average, in last 5 y, choosing from 5 possible frequency responses
ranging from ‘‘never’’ or ‘‘once per year’’ to ‘‘every day,’’ and how much
they consumed each time (in ‘‘liang,’’ 1 liang = 50 g). The average intake
(g/d) of each food item was then calculated. For seasonal foods (i.e., fresh
vegetables and fruits), the duration of intake (mo/y) was also asked, and
the average intake of these foods was further multiplied by the number of
months and then divided by 12. Average nutrient intakes (per day) were
computed by multiplying the average intake (g/d) by the nutrient density
content from the China Food Composition Tables (14). The energy and
weight of each food item were summed for all caloric beverages and solid
foods (e.g., not including tea or pure water consumption, for which
energy content is almost zero) to derive the total energy intake (kJ/d) and
the total weight of foods (g/d). DED was calculated as the available
dietary energy per unit weight of foods (kJ/g) as follows:

Assessment of other factors. A detailed structured questionnaire was
completed in face-to-face interviews carried out by trained study staff. It
included questions on age, sex, educational level, disease history, family
history of cancer, cigarette smoking, tea and alcohol drinking, and
medication use. Smoking was coded as 0, 0.025 to <13.7, 13.7 to <27.4,
27.4 to <41.1, $41.1 pack-years. The following anthropometric informa-
tion was also requested: height at age 21 y, adult usual body weight, and
adult usual BMI calculated as body weight in kilograms divided by the
square of height in meters.

Calculations and statistical analyses. Results were expressed as
means 6 SDs for continuous variables and frequencies (percentages) for
categorical variables. Differences between cases and controls were tested
by t tests for continuous variables and by x2 tests for categorical
variables. DED was deﬁned both as a continuous variable and a
categorical variable (5 groups by distributions in control participants).
Associations between DED and risk of pancreatic cancer were examined
by using unconditional logistic regressions. The ﬁrst model was adjusted
for age (continuous), sex, and adult BMI (continuous). The second
model was further adjusted for the following potential confounding
factors: education (primary school or lower, middle or high school,
college or higher), family history of cancer (none, nonpancreatic cancer,
pancreatic cancer), smoking (0, 0.025 to <13.7, 13.7 to <27.4, 27.4 to
<41.1, $41.1 pack-years), self-reported history of type 2 diabetes (yes,
no), and self-reported history of pancreatitis. The third model further
included the following dietary factors: regular alcohol consumption (g/d,
continuous), total energy intake (kJ/d, continuous), and green tea
drinking (g/d, continuous). We repeated the analyses using energy-
adjusted DED computed as residuals from the regression model
developed by Willett et al. (15).

Values in the text are means 6 SEMs. All statistical analyses were
performed by using STATA statistical software (version 9.2; StataCorp).

Results

Characteristics of the cases and controls are shown in Table 1.
Pancreatic cancer patients consumed a more-energy-dense diet
than control participants. Energy density (adjusted for age, sex,
and total energy intake) was signiﬁcantly higher in cases (6.08 6
0.04 kJ/g) than in controls (5.91 6 0.04 kJ/g) (P = 0.003).

Increased risk of pancreatic cancer was associated with DED
as shown in Table 2. This was true both for the continuous
association per unit increase in energy density and according to
quintiles of energy density. A 1-unit increase in DED was

associated with a 16% increase in risk (OR: 1.16; 95% CI: 1.07,
1.27; P < 0.001). Compared with the lowest quintile of DED, the
highest quintile showed a 72% increased risk (OR: 1.72; 95%
CI: 1.25, 2.35; P = 0.001). Adjusting for percentage of energy
from fat instead of total energy intake did not materially change
the results (highest vs. lowest quintile OR: 1.84; 95% CI: 1.32,
2.56; P < 0.001). We repeated the analyses in men and women
separately and found similar trends in both sexes, although with
reduced statistical power because of smaller sample sizes: with
DED as continuous variable (OR: 1.20; 95% CI: 1.07, 1.33 in
men; OR: 1.14; 95% CI: 0.99, 1.30 in women; model 3). We
also repeated the analyses in different SEER (Surveillance,
Epidemiology, End-Stages) separately and found similar trends
in all stages (data not shown).

In analyses using energy-adjusted residuals (see Participants
and Methods), the results were unchanged. The correlation
coefﬁcient was 0.168 (P < 0.001) between raw energy density
and total energy intake and 0.0002 (P = 0.99) between energy-
adjusted residuals and total energy intake. A 1-unit increase in
energy-adjusted residuals was associated with an 18% increase
in risk (OR: 1.18; 95% CI: 1.08, 1.28; P < 0.001; model 3).
Compared with the lowest quintile of energy-adjusted residuals,
the highest quintile showed an 80% increased risk (OR: 1.80;
95% CI: 1.31, 2.47; P < 0.001).

To show the composition of an energy-diluted diet, we
summarized the mean intake of major food groups by categories
of DED (Table 3). After adjusting for age, sex, and total energy
intake, compared with the most energy-dense group, partici-
pants in the most energy-diluted group consumed signiﬁcantly
more fresh fruits, vegetables, white meat, soy products, and
dairy products; a moderate amount of alcohol; fewer staple
foods (rice, noodles, breads, etc.) and had less total energy
intake.

Discussion

We found, separate from age, sex, BMI, cigarette smoking,
family history of cancer, and total energy intake, a positive
association between DED and risk of pancreatic cancer. The risk
was elevated by 72% in the highest energy density quintile
compared with the lowest one. This ﬁnding, if conﬁrmed, could
be helpful in understanding the etiology of pancreatic cancer and
may provide scientiﬁc evidence for its prevention.

Our study adds new information on the association of dietary
intake and pancreatic cancer. In the EPIC study, Wang et al. (6)
found a low-energy-dense diet to be associated with a lower risk
of type 2 diabetes. DED assesses the quality of the whole diet
instead of its elements. There are 3 major determinants of DED.
One is fat, because fat is the most energy-dense nutrient and fat
content varies substantially between various foods (16). The
other is water, because its energy content is zero and its amount
varies greatly among foods. In addition, ﬁber also has the
potential to inﬂuence DED, because it has a low energy content
and is able to bind water, but its range of concentrations in
commonly eaten foods is much smaller. Therefore, an advantage
of our study was our evaluation of the quality of diet using DED
rather than the proportions of a single food or a group of foods.
The energy density of the whole diet accounts for the
complicated interactions between various foods in the context of
a free-living population. DED is a weighed energy density of
individual elements in a diet, and thus is less informative in

biological relations between a single food or nutrient and cancer
risk. Large proportions of foods with high energy density, such
as fatty foods, contribute to a more energy-dense diet, whereas
foods with a high water content contribute to an energy-diluted
diet. In our study, energy-diluted diets included fewer staple
foods, more fresh fruits and vegetables, more white meat, more
soy and dairy products, and more (i.e., modest amounts of)
alcohol.

Our study is the ﬁrst, to our knowledge, to examine the
association between DED and pancreatic cancer risk in a large,
population-based case-control setting of >900 cases. The
participants in our study were more representative of the urban
Shanghai population. Cases in our study were recruited from 37
major hospitals in urban Shanghai, and controls were randomly
selected from the whole population in the same area. Further-
more, the ascertainment of our cases was thorough. Patients
were included as potential cases once reported by a physician,
and then conﬁrmed by a group of pathological and clinical
experts on the basis of hospital records, pathology reports and
slides, and/or imaging material.

The limitations of our study merit consideration. Dietary
intake in our study was assessed by a semiquantitative FFQ with
its associated limitations. Disease bias (i.e., people with cancer
try to explain their disease as a consequence of their dietary
choices) also inﬂuences participantsÕ recall of food intake. For
example, patients might overestimate their intake of ‘‘un-
healthy’’ foods and underestimate their intake of ‘‘healthy’’

foods. However, to record usual dietary habits, the question-
naire asked participants about food intakes in the previous 5 y.
Given that patients might change their diet during this period
because of their as yet undiagnosed disease, the questionnaire
also asked about changes in diet during the last year. In
Shanghai, most food is home-produced (i.e., typically, house-
wives purchase raw materials from markets and cook at home,
and fast food is less available or popular than in developed
countries). Thus, if undiagnosed cases reduced their intake of
high-protein, high-fat foods, they would tend to turn to grains,
vegetables, and fruits because of their increasing inability to
tolerate foods requiring pancreatic enzymes for digestion. The
diet change questionnaire gave us some clues about how patients
changed their diets 1 y before diagnosis. We found that 57% of
cases did not change their diets (i.e., did not change any food
group intake), 39% of cases reduced their red meat consumption
(beef, lamb, and pork), 27% of cases reduced poultry consump-
tion (chicken and duck), 14% of cases increased their intake of
vegetables, and 10% increased their intake of fruits. There was
no signiﬁcant difference in total energy intake between cases and
controls (P = 0.67). Therefore, whole-diet energy density of
cases tended to decrease, which weakened the association of
DED with pancreatic cancer risk in our study. We also repeated
all risk analyses using energy-adjusted residuals of energy
density, which removed the effect of total energy intake, and
the results remained the same. Another limitation is the use of
self-reported history of type 2 diabetes, which was reported to be
a potential risk factor for pancreatic cancer. However, the
questionnaire included several other related questions to help
participants recall their medical history. In all, 339 participants
reported they had been ‘‘told by a doctor that they have type 2
diabetes’’; among these, 326 (96.2%) reported that they had
been ‘‘diagnosed based upon blood tests,’’ 309 (91.2%) reported
that they had ‘‘used oral anti-diabetic drugs,’’ and 104 (30.7%)
reported that they had ‘‘used insulin.’’ In addition, self-reported
adult height and body weight were used in statistical analyses,
which would reﬂect their normal status before cancer develop-
ment better but which is also less accurate.

The mechanism for an association between DED and risk of
pancreatic cancer is not yet understood. It has been reported that
a high-energy-dense diet increased the risk of type 2 diabetes,
which would result in insulin resistance and induced compen-
satory hyperinsulinemia (6). High concentrations of insulin
would enhance insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 synthesis and
downregulate IGF-1 binding proteins, leading to an increase in
the bioavailability of free IGF-1, which transduces its down-
stream signaling pathways to promote tumor development by
inhibiting apoptosis, stimulating cell proliferation, and enhanc-
ing angiogenesis (7). Foods that are high in DED tend to be more
palatable than foods that are low in DED, and high palatability
is associated with increased food intake in single-meal studies
and with increased energy intake at subsequent meals, so-called
passive overeating. In our study, DED was positively associated
with increased total energy intake, but with adjustment, the
association between DED and risk of pancreatic cancer was
independent of total energy intake, BMI, and self-reported
history of type 2 diabetes (Table 2). Future studies are needed to
elucidate the possible mechanisms of the association between
high DED and the development of pancreatic cancer.

In summary, we have shown in a large-scale, population-
based case-control study that higher-energy-dense diets are
associated with increased risk of pancreatic cancer risk,
independent of age, BMI, cigarette smoking, family history of
cancer, history of type 2 diabetes, and total energy intake. This
ﬁnding has potential
implications for preventing pancreatic
cancer through modiﬁcation of diet and merits further research.
