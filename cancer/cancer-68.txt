ABSTRACT The intake of ﬂavonols, ﬂavones and isoﬂavones by Japanese women was calculated from our
food-phytochemical composition table. The relationship between intake of these phytochemicals and various
anthropometric and blood chemistry data was analyzed in a cross-sectional study. The subjects were 115 women
volunteers, aged 29 –78 y, living in the northern part of Japan. Each subject completed a 3-d dietary record and
received a health check up, including urine and blood sampling for biochemical analysis. Total mean intakes of
ﬂavonoids (sum of ﬂavonols and ﬂavones) and isoﬂavones were 16.7 and 47.2 mg/d, respectively. The major
source of ﬂavonoids was onions (45.9%) and that of isoﬂavones was tofu (37.0%). Total intake of isoﬂavones
exceeded that of other dietary antioxidants, such as ﬂavonoids, carotenoids (3.5 mg/d) and vitamin E (8.2 mg/d),
and was approximately one half of the vitamin C intake (109 mg/d). The total intake of ﬂavonoids was inversely
correlated with the plasma total cholesterol concentration (TC) (r 5 20.236, P , 0.05) and plasma LDL cholesterol
concentration (LDL-C) (r 5 20.220, P , 0.05), after the adjustment for age, body mass index and total energy
intake. As a single component, quercetin was inversely correlated with both TC (r 5 20.261, P , 0.01) and LDL-C
(r 5 20.263, P , 0.01). Among Japanese, ﬂavonoid and isoﬂavone intake is the main component among
nonnutrient phytochemicals with antioxidant potential in the diet. These results suggest that a high consumption
of both ﬂavonoids and isoﬂavones by Japanese women may contribute to their low incidence of coronary heart
disease compared with women in other countries. J. Nutr. 130: 2243–2250, 2000.

The Japanese mortality rate for cardiovascular disease and
various cancers, except for gastric cancer, is lower than that of
Caucasians (WHO 1996). More than 600 food factors in
vegetables are now considered to inﬂuence human health
(Huang et al. 1994). A large number of epidemiologic studies
investigating the relationship between diet and cancer were
reviewed, and a preventive effect of the consumption of veg-
etables and fruits on various types of cancer has been con-
ﬁrmed (Steinmetz and Potter 1996). This protective effect has
been attributed in general to the antioxidative capacities of
vitamin C, E and carotenoids in food. However, the impor-
tance of other potentially protective compounds, such as ﬂa-
vonoids in vegetables and fruits, has been recognized (Hertog
et al. 1992a and 1992b). Epidemiologic studies show that
dietary ﬂavonoid intake is inversely associated with mortality
from coronary heart disease (CHD)3 (Hertog et al. 1993,

These results were supported by in vitro studies, such as the
inhibition of LDL oxidation and platelet aggregation by ﬂa-
vonoids (De Whalley et al. 1990, Tzeng et al. 1991). Fla-
vonoids are strong antioxidants and scavengers of free radicals
(Husain et al. 1987).

The Japanese consume a wide range of

isoﬂavone-rich
soybean products (Ministry of Health and Welfare 1998).
Such a high intake of isoﬂavones is assumed to protect against
cancer, especially estrogen-related cancers, such as breast, en-
dometrial, ovarian, prostatic and colon cancer (Adlercreutz et
al. 1995, Watanabe and Koessel 1993, Watanabe et al. 1997).
Isoﬂavones have shown antioxidant activity in both in vivo
and in vitro studies (Ruiz-Larrea et al. 1997, Watanabe et al.
2000a). Genistein, in particular, can inhibit the oxidative
modiﬁcation of isolated LDL (Hodgson et al. 1996).

These phytochemicals may beneﬁt human health if they are
consumed appropriately in the diet. Intake of isoﬂavone-rich

soy hypocotyl tea or isoﬂavone-rich tablets decreased phos-
phatidylcholine hydroperoxide
phosphatidylethano-
lamine hydroperoxide in red blood cells and lowered urinary
excretion of 8-hydroxy-29-deoxyguanosine in humans (Wa-
tanabe et al. 2000a), but hormonal levels were also inﬂuenced
as a result of this intervention trial (Watanabe et al. 2000b).
No guidelines exist for consumption of these phytochemicals;
thus it is not known what level of intake is appropriate for the
prevention of disease. The investigators studied an appropriate
dietary amount of ﬂavonoids and isoﬂavones for the preven-
tion of disease. Accurate estimation of phytochemical intake is
important. We created food composition tables for four ﬂa-
vonols, one ﬂavone and two isoﬂavones to estimate intake.
The validity of this table was veriﬁed by comparing the cor-
related intakes with plasma and urinary isoﬂavone levels (Arai
et al. 2000). The intake of ﬂavonols, ﬂavones and isoﬂavones
was calculated with the use of this table, and the relationship
between these phytochemicals and various anthropometric
and blood chemistry data were analyzed in a cross-sectional
study.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS

Nutrition survey and health check up program. The study was
conducted in September 1997 and 1998 in the northern part of Japan.
An urban rural community (population ;50,000) in this area has
been our ﬁeld for a population-based prospective study and nutri-
tional training since 1980. The subjects were 115 female volunteers,
who each agreed to participate to this study and gave written in-
formed consent. The study design was approved by the Ethical Com-
mittee in Tokyo University of Agriculture. All subjects were house-
wives who also worked in agriculture, such as the cultivation of
vegetables and rice. Fifteen subjects were employees of local govern-
ment and private industry. The physical activities of each subject
were classiﬁed according to guidelines of the Ministry of Health and
Welfare (1994) as follows: light, n 5 27; moderate, n 5 68; and
semiheavy, n 5 20. Ninety-one women (79%) were postmenopausal.
The prevalence of regular cigarette smoking and alcohol consump-
tion was 4 (3.5%) and 42 (36.5%) women, respectively.

Each person completed a 3-d dietary record and anthropometric
measurements were taken on d 4 of the study, including blood
sampling for biochemical analysis. Each subject recorded the amount
and kind of food and beverages consumed during the study period.
These dietary records were then checked by trained dieticians and
coded for calculating the level of energy and nutrients using the
Standard Tables of Food Composition (The Science and Technology
Agency of Japan 1982).

The anthropometric measurements were carried out for height,
weight and blood pressure. Body mass index (BMI, kg/m2) was cal-
culated from height and weight. The number of steps taken during
the study period was measured by a walking meter (EM-200, Yamasa
Watch, Tokyo, Japan). The subjects constantly wore a walking meter
from rising in the morning to bedtime at night.

After an overnight fast, blood samples were collected with a
vacuum syringe containing heparin powder. The plasma was isolated
by centrifugation (2000 3 g, 10 min, 4°C) and used for biochemical
analysis of total protein (TP), albumin, total cholesterol (TC), tri-
acylglycerol (TG), HDL cholesterol (HDL-C), uric acid, creatinine,
glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT), glutamic pyruvic transam-
inase (GPT), g-glutamyl transpeptidase (g-GTP), alkaline phospha-
tase, cholinesterase and total bilirubin. Biochemical analysis was
done with a clinical analyzer (Hitachi 7250, Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan).
Plasma LDL cholesterol concentration (LDL-C) was calculated using
the Friedewald formula (Friedewald et al. 1972). The albumin/glob-
ulin ratio was calculated from the concentration of TP and albumin.
The RBC count, hemoglobin and white blood cell count were ana-
lyzed from whole blood by an automatic analyzer (SE-9000, SYS-
MEX, Hyogo, Japan).

Analysis of ﬂavonols, ﬂavone and isoﬂavones in food. The
amounts of four kinds of ﬂavonols (myricetin, ﬁsetin, quercetin and

kaempferol) and one kind of ﬂavone (luteolin) were determined in 15
vegetables, 8 fruits, 2 legumes, 1 potato and green tea. The amounts
of two kinds of isoﬂavones (daidzein and genistein) were determined
in soybeans, bean sprouts and traditional Japanese soybean products,
such as tofu (soybean curd), natto (fermented soybean), miso (soy-
bean paste) and shoyu (soy sauce). In most cases, at least three food
samples were purchased at a local market and prepared for analysis on
the same day. The whole foods were washed in water, chopped and
homogenized. The samples were then freeze-dried and kept frozen at
280°C until analysis.

The analysis of ﬂavonols and ﬂavone was carried out by a modiﬁed
method of hydrolysis by Hertog et al. (1992b), and extraction and
HPLC condition by Terada and Miyabe (1993) and Shimoi et al.
(1997). In brief, a 0.25-g freeze-dried food sample was extracted with
25 mL of 50% methanol containing 1.2 mol/L HCl and 1.6 g/L
tert-butylhydroquinone for 2 h at 90°C. The extract was diluted to
100 mL with methanol. After centrifugation (1000 3 g, 5 min, 4°C),
a 2-mL aliquot was dried by evaporation under nitrogen gas ﬂow,
dissolved in 20 mL of methanol and added to 1.5 mL of 0.01 mol/L
oxalic acid. Finally, it was applied to Sep-Pak C18 cartridges (Waters,
Milford, MA). These were washed with 1 mL of 0.01 mol/L oxalic
acid, 1 mL methanol/water/0.01 mol/L oxalic acid (25:73:2. v/v/v)
and 10 mL water; the ﬂavonoids were eluted with 5 mL methanol and
the methanol fraction was dried by evaporation under nitrogen gas
ﬂow. The residue was dissolved in 100 mL methanol, of which 10 mL
was used for HPLC analysis. Flavonoids were measured by the JASCO
HPLC system (JASCO, Tokyo, Japan) with a Capcell Pak C18-
UG120 column (150 3 4.6 mm i.d., 5-mm particle size) (Shiseido,
Tokyo, Japan) at 50°C. Flavonoid peaks were detected at 372 nm.
The ﬂow rate was carried out at 0.7 mL/min and the mobile phase was
methanol/distilled water/0.5 mol/L oxalic acid solution (40:60:2, v/v/
v). The retention times of the ﬂavonoids were 3.4 (myricetin), 3.9
(ﬁsetin), 6.2 (quercetin), 7.5 (luteolin) and 11.0 min (kaempferol).
The isoﬂavones were analyzed using the hydrolysis and extraction
method of Mazur et al. (1996) combined with the HPLC method
described by Gamache et al. (1997). Freeze-dried samples (0.01 g)
were put in glass tubes and 0.5 mL of distilled water was added to
each. After the samples stood for 10 min, they were hydrolyzed
overnight at 37°C with 0.5 mL of an enzyme solution [0.5 mL Helix
pomatia juice (Type HP-2S, Sigma, St. Louis, MO) in 10 mL of 0.2
mol/L acetate buffer (pH 4.0) containing 0.15 g ascorbic acid]. The
hydrolyzed samples were extracted twice with 5 mL diethyl ether, and
the ether fraction was dried by evaporation under nitrogen gas ﬂow.
The residue was dissolved in 1 mL methanol, and 20 mL of that
solution was analyzed by HPLC with diode-array UV detection scan-
ning from 250 to 400 nm (Beckman Coulter K.K., Tokyo, Japan).
Isoﬂavone peaks were detected at 254 nm. The HPLC column ODS-
80Ts-Qa (150 3 4.6 mm i.d., 5-mm particle size) (Tosoh, Tokyo,
Japan) was used with a guard column (TSKguardgel ODS-80Ts, 1.5
3 3.2 mm i.d., 5 mm particle size) (Tosoh), and the temperature kept
at 25°C using a column oven. HPLC analysis was carried out by linear
gradient, from 1.5:0.5:8.0 [methanol, acetonitrile, 0.2 mol/L acetate
buffer (pH 4.0), v/v/v] to 6.0:3.0:1.0 for 45 min, and returned to the
initial condition for 5 min. The ﬂow rate was 1.0 mL/min. The
retention times of daidzein and genistein were 21.0 and 25.0 min,
respectively.

All measurements were carried out in duplicate. Quantiﬁcation of
each ﬂavonoid and isoﬂavone was done by measuring peak areas on
the basis of calibration plots of the peak area of standards at various
concentrations. HPLC standards were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
Japan K.K. (Osaka, Japan; quercetin and myricetin), Funakoshi (To-
kyo, Japan; kaempherol), Wako Pure Chemicals (Osaka, Japan; lu-
teolin and ﬁsetin) and Indoﬁne Chemical Company (Somerville, NJ;
daidzein and genistein). All solvents and chemicals used were HPLC
grade or analytical grade.

Statistical analysis. Statistical analysis was conducted using the
SPSS package (SPSS 1998). Pearson’s correlation coefﬁcients were
calculated between intake of antioxidant vitamins and phytochemi-
cals and dietary variables or various health indices, such as anthro-
pometric and blood biochemical analysis data. Two-sided P-values
, 0.05 were considered signiﬁcant. Signiﬁcant association was fur-

pre- and postmenopausal women was 24 (20.9%) and 91
(79.1%), respectively. The length of the menstrual cycle of
premenopausal women, aged 43.3 6 6.8 y, was 29 d (range
25–35 d). Postmenopausal women had signiﬁcantly higher
plasma TC (5.64 6 0.91 vs. 5.04 6 0.79 mmol/L) and LDL-C
(3.61 6 0.86 vs. 3.13 6 0.76 mmol/L) as well as systolic blood
pressure (128 6 14 vs. 116 6 18 mm Hg), and plasma hepatic

antioxidative activity and selected foods rich in phytochemi-
cals are shown in Table 3. There was no signiﬁcant difference
in dietary intake of nutrients or food groups between premeno-
pausal and postmenopausal women. The average intake of
energy and nutrients exceeded the recommended dietary al-
lowance for Japanese (Fig. 1).

Intake of total ﬂavonoids (sum of myricetin, ﬁsetin, quer-
cetin, kaempferol and luteolin) calculated from the 3-d dietary
records using our ﬂavonoid composition table (Table 4) was
16.7 6 9.2 mg/d, ranging from 2.0 to 42.4 mg/d (Fig. 2). The
composition of the total ﬂavonoid intake was 55.9% quercetin,
35.3% kaempferol, 4.6% ﬁsetin, 2.5% myricetin and 1.7%
luteolin. Among the ﬁve ﬂavonoids, the intake of quercetin
and kaempherol was greatest (Table 5).

Onions were the main source of total ﬂavonoid intake
(45.9%, 23.1 g/d), followed by molokheya (9.7%, 4.6 g/d),

apples (7.2%, 22.2 g/d) and green tea (5.4%, 206 mL/d). The
intake of ﬂavonoids was attributable to vegetables (72.3%),
fruits (15.6%), green tea (5.4%), potatoes (3.8%) and pulses
(tofu) (2.9%) (Table 5). Quercetin intake came mainly from
onions (83.6%), whereas kaempferol came from various veg-
etables and fruits. Vegetable and fruit intake, used for the
calculation of ﬂavonoid intake, consisted of 78.0 and 70.4% of
all vegetable and fruit consumption by weight, respectively, in
the dietary records.

Intake of total isoﬂavones (sum of daidzein and genistein)
calculated from the 3-d dietary records using the isoﬂavone
composition table (Table 6) was 47.2 6 23.6 mg/d, ranging
from 12.0 to 118.9 mg/d (Fig. 2). Isoﬂavone intake exceeded
100 mg/d in six subjects (5.2%). Genistein made up most of
the isoﬂavone intake (30.5 6 15.6 mg/d), and daidzein intake
(16.6 6 8.0 mg/d) was about half that of genistein (Table 7).
Isoﬂavone intake was attributable to tofu (sum of various
types, 37.0%, 49.4 g/d), natto (31.0%, 14.8 g/d) and miso
(15.7%, 17.0 g/d), which accounted for 84.3% of pulse con-
sumption by weight in the dietary records (Table 7).

Flavonoid intake was positively correlated with vitamin C
intake (r 5 0.426, P , 0.01), as was carotenoid intake (r
5 0.347, P , 0.001), vegetable intake (r 5 0.402, P , 0.001)
and fruit intake (r 5 0.210, P , 0.05). Dietary ﬁber intake
correlated positively with both total ﬂavonoid intake (r
5 0.265, P , 0.001) and total isoﬂavone intake (r 5 0.414, P
, 0.001). Vitamin E intake did not correlate with ﬂavonoid
and isoﬂavone intake. These associations remained unchanged
after adjustment for total energy intake.

After adjustment for age, BMI and total energy intake,

ﬂavonoid intake was inversely associated with plasma TC (r
5 20.236, P , 0.05) and LDL-C (r 5 20.220, P , 0.05).
Among the ﬁve ﬂavonoids, quercetin intake was inversely
correlated with plasma TC (r 5 20.261, P , 0.01) and
LDL-C (r 5 20.263, P , 0.01) (Fig. 3). After further adjust-
ment for age, BMI and total energy intake, dietary variables
(intake of fat, carotenoids, vitamin C, dietary ﬁber and cho-
lesterol), green tea consumption, number of steps taken, sys-
tolic and diastolic blood pressure, cigarette use, alcohol use
and menopausal status, the association between quercetin in-
take and plasma LDL-C was unaffected (r 5 20.316, P
, 0.01). Plasma HDL-C and TG, however, did not correlate
with the intake of any ﬂavonoids. Isoﬂavone, carotenoid,
vitamin C and E intakes were not signiﬁcantly correlated with
plasma lipid concentrations. Other blood and biochemical
data were not correlated with the intake of any ﬂavonoids,
isoﬂavones or antioxidant vitamins.

DISCUSSION

The biological function of phytochemicals has increasing
importance in nutritional science. Epidemiologic studies in
Japan have suggested the importance of isoﬂavone intake to
prevent estrogen-related cancers, osteoporosis and menopausal
symptoms (Adlercreutz and Mazur 1997, Watanabe and Koes-
sel 1993).

We estimated the intakes of ﬂavonols, ﬂavone and isoﬂa-
vones in Japanese women and tried to determine any relation-
ship that existed between these phytochemicals and various

measurements of the amount of ﬂavonoids in foods was achiev-
ing complete hydrolysis of all glycosides of ﬂavonols, ﬂavones
and isoﬂavones without substantial loss of ﬂavonoid and isoﬂa-
vone. In the case of isoﬂavones, enzymatic hydrolysis of glu-
curonidase, sulfatase and other unknown enzymes in Helix
pomatia juice yielded a maximum amount of isoﬂavones (Ma-
zur et al. 1996). In contrast, ﬂavonol and ﬂavone hydrolysis
presented some difﬁculty. Harborne (1965) reported that the
time required for complete hydrolysis depended on the binding
site of sugar on the ﬂavonoid nucleus: C7.C49.C3. Onions
contain mainly C49 glycosides and tea C3 rutinosides (rutin).
Apples contain a variety of quercetin glycosides, such as gla-
ctosides and rhamnosides (Harrmann 1976). Hertog et al.

study drawn from a population-based prospective study.

Our content table for ﬂavonols, ﬂavone and isoﬂavones
agrees well with previous reports. Hertog et al. (1992a) re-
ported that the quercetin concentration in onions was 347
mg/g, and Crozier et al. (1997) reported it to be 342 mg/g. We
obtained a similar value (337 mg/g). Toda et al. (1997) re-
ported concentrations of isoﬂavones in 24 commercial Japa-
nese soybean foods. Their isoﬂavone values and ours (sum of
daidzein and genistein) are shown as follows: tofu (momen
type), 422 vs. 435 mg/g; miso, 476 vs. 457 mg/g; and natto,

(1992 b) reported that ﬂavonoid content after .2 h of hydro-
lysis was 10% higher than that after only 2 h of hydrolysis.
Because we did not optimize conditions according to food
type, ﬂavonoid content in some foods could have been under-
estimated.

The average intake of ﬂavonoids was 16.7 6 9.2 mg/d in
this study. This value agrees well with our previous study, in
which the average ﬂavonoid intake was 16.2 6 9.5 mg/d
(Kimira et al. 1998). Shimoi and Kinae (1997) analyzed the
ﬂavonoid concentration in seven different kinds of duplicate
meals. The range of ﬂavonoid concentration was from ;5 to
30 mg/meal. Thus the intake of ﬂavonoids in the Japanese diet
is estimated to be from 10 to 90 mg/d. Hertog et al. (1995)
estimated that the average intake of total ﬂavonoids was ;65
mg/d in two areas in the western part of Japan. Tea was the
major source of ﬂavonoids in their study, in which . 80% of
ﬂavonoid intake came from about seven cups (700 mL) of
green tea per day. In our study, the main sources of ﬂavonoid
intake were vegetables,
tomatoes and
molokheya, followed by fruits and green tea. The average
intake of green tea was 206 mL/d (2 cups). The intake of

catechin [(-)-epigallocatechin gallate] from tea was estimated
to be ;40 mg/d.

Willet (1998) reported that the number of days required for
the estimation of various nutrient intakes differed greatly.
Wakai et al. (1999) calculated that the number of days re-
quired for determining 95% of the observed values of daidzein
and genistein was 34, 76 and 305 d to obtain accurate intake
estimates within a range of 30, 20 and 10%, respectively. Our
study considered only ﬁve types of ﬂavonoids out of 4000 that
are known; but these ﬁve are known to be important compo-

nents because of their antimutagenic (Kanazawa et al. 1997)
and antioxidative properties (Catapano 1997, Ho 1997).

Regardless of the above-described limitations, the present
study showed that plasma LDL-C correlated inversely with the
intake of quercetin, even after adjusting for other antioxidant
vitamins.

Igarashi and Ohmura (1995) reported that rats fed a cho-
lesterol-enriched diet had lower TC when diets were supple-
mented with isoramnetin, rhamnetin or quercetin, among
which quercetin was the most effective. The fecal excretion of
cholesterol and bile acids from rats fed quercetin was slightly
higher than that of control rats. Flavonoids have been re-
ported to have an antioxidant effect due to their ability to
scavenge free radicals or to chelate metal ions (Belguendouz et
al. 1997, Husain et al. 1987). It has been suggested that the
TC- and LDL-C–reducing effects of ﬂavonoids prevent CHD
and other chronic diseases in concert with the antioxidative
effect of ﬂavonoids.

Imai and Nakachi (1995) also reported a signiﬁcant reduc-
tion of serum TC and TG in Japanese men who consumed
.1000 mL (10 cups) of green tea per day. In our study,
however, green tea consumption was not related to plasma
lipid concentration, and adjusting for green tea consumption
did not alter the inverse correlation of ﬂavonoid intake with
plasma lipids. Cassidy et al. (1995) reported that the admin-
istration of textured soy protein signiﬁcantly reduced plasma
TC and LDL-C concentrations in premenopausal women.
Whether isoﬂavones have a cholesterol-lowering effect is still
unresolved (Bakhit et al. 1994, Carroll 1991, Hodgson et al.
1998), Nelson et al. 1997, Potter et al. 1993. In our interven-
tion study using isoﬂavone tablets, plasma cholesterol and TG
concentrations were not affected (Watanabe et al. 2000b).

Intake of isoﬂavones exceeded that of other dietary antioxi-
dants, such as ﬂavonoids (16 mg), carotenoids (3 mg) and vita-
min E (8 mg), reaching a level that was approximately one half
that of vitamin C (108 mg) (Fig. 2). Isoﬂavones in the Japanese
diet may contribute much to antioxidant effects in the body.
Although the isoﬂavones were not correlated with plasma LDL-C
in our study, these antioxidant properties would contribute to the
prevention of LDL oxidation and lower mortality from CHD (De
Whalley et al. 1990, Palinski et al. 1989, Parthasarathy et al.
1992, Witztum and Steinburg 1991).
