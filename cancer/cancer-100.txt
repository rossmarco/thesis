Garlic consumption and cancer prevention: meta-analyses of 
colorectal and stomach cancers1–3

Aaron T Fleischauer, Charles Poole, and Lenore Arab

ABSTRACT
Background: Animal and in vitro studies have provided evidence
of an anticarcinogenic effect of active ingredients in garlic.
Objective: The  objective  was  to  conduct  meta-analyses  of  the
epidemiologic literature on the association between garlic con-
sumption  and  risk  of  stomach, colon, head  and  neck,
lung,
breast, and prostate cancers.
Design: Meta-analyses were conducted for all cancers mutually
and separately for colorectal and stomach cancers in relation to
consumption  of  exclusively  raw  garlic, cooked  garlic, or  both
(RC garlic). Eighteen studies reported a relative risk estimate for
RC garlic consumption and cancer risk.
Results: In the meta-analyses of colorectal and stomach cancer,
the  reference  categories  ranged  from  no  consumption  to  con-
sumption  of  3.5  g/wk, whereas  the  highest  categories  ranged
from  any  consumption  to  > 28.8  g/wk.  The  average  difference
between  the  highest  and  lowest  categories  was  16  g/wk.  The
random-effects relative risk (RR) estimate of colorectal cancer
and RC garlic consumption, excluding garlic supplements, was
0.69  (95%  CI: 0.55, 0.89).  For  stomach  cancer, the  random-
effects RR estimate was 0.53 (95% CI: 0.31, 0.92). The hetero-
geneity among studies for the latter outcome (P = 0.0002) indi-
cates  the  questionableness  of  the  generalizability  of  this
summary estimate. An indication of publication bias for all can-
cers combined is evident from a funnel plot of RC garlic con-
sumption and cancer risk and from the results of the Begg and
Mazumdar test (P = 0.049).
Conclusions: High intake of RC garlic may be associated with a
protective effect against stomach and colorectal cancers. Hetero-
geneity of effect estimates, differences in dose estimation, publi-
cation bias, and possible alternative hypotheses (eg, confounding
by  total  vegetable  consumption)  preclude  sole  reliance  on  sum-
mary effect estimates.

INTRODUCTION

Numerous  scientific  reports  imply  that  vegetable  intake  may
affect cancer incidence. Epidemiologic studies offer evidence that
a high consumption of vegetables reduces the risk of colorectal
and stomach cancers (1). In addition, there is some evidence that

the same is true for cancers of the breast, larynx, and prostate (1).
On the basis of results of animal and in vitro studies indicating an
anticarcinogenic effect of garlic (Allium sativum), a review of the
epidemiologic literature was conducted and presented elsewhere
(2, 3). The review suggested a protective effect of high intakes of
garlic against cancers of the stomach, colon and rectum, breast,
prostate, and  larynx.  Since  the  results  of  this  review  were  pub-
lished, 3  additional  studies  of  garlic  consumption  and  cancer
reported  results  supporting  this  hypothesis  (4–6).  Motivated  by
this  and  the  findings  of  animal  experiments, we  report  results
from site-specific meta-analyses of the relation between the con-
sumption  of  raw  garlic, cooked  garlic, or  both  raw  and  cooked
garlic (RC) and the risk of cancer in humans.

METHODS

Epidemiologic  studies  included  in  these  meta-analyses
were  identified  through  a  literature  search  conducted  in
August  1999.  The  MEDLINE  database  (National  Library  of
Medicine, Bethesda, MD)  was  searched  for  articles  published
between  1  January  1966  and  15  August  1999.  The  reference
terms garlic, Allium vegetable, vegetable, diet, and nutrition in
combination with cancer, neoplasm, and individual cancer sub-
types  were  used  as  both  key  words  and  subject  terms.  The
search  was  limited  to  human  studies  published  in  English.  In
addition, journal articles cited in the primary articles were col-
lected and added to the review. From the ⬇300 studies of veg-
etable consumption and cancer risk, 22 reported a relative risk
(RR)  estimate  for  RC  garlic  intake  and  cancer  risk.  Two  of
these studies examined the combination of RC garlic and total
Allium vegetable  consumption  and  4  studies  examined  garlic
supplements only. The adjusted RR estimate, CI, P value, year
of publication, country, number of subjects, and RC garlic cat-
egorization and covariates were abstracted from these studies.
From each published report, RR estimates and 95% CIs for the

procedure were described elsewhere (25, 26). In brief, the pro-
cedure assumes that large studies are more prone to yield results
close to the true value than are smaller studies. Larger studies,
with  smaller  SEs  and  increased  power  to  detect  a  true  effect,
will form the spout of a funnel. Smaller studies with larger vari-
ance will tend to disperse, forming the cone. Gaps that appear in
this  graph  are  an  indication  of  publication  bias.  Gaps  are
hypothesized to be particularly likely among studies with high
SEs  and  implausible  point  estimates.  In  addition, two-sided
P values were obtained for a log-rank test of publication bias,
developed by Begg and Mazumdar (27). Results for all cancers
are presented in Figure 1.

A  meta-analysis  of  multiple  groupings  of  the  published  epi-
demiologic  studies  was  performed.  The  SEs  were  calculated
from the extracted RR estimates and 95% CIs by using the fol-
lowing equation:

SE = [ln(RRupper) ⫺ ln(RRlower)]/3.92

(1)

However, when the 95% CI was not reported, an estimate of the
SE was calculated from an exact P value (to ≥ 2 decimal places)
by using the following equation:

SE = [ln(RR)]/z

(2)

where  z is  the z score  of  the  normal  distribution  for  the  exact
P value. In converting RC garlic consumption frequency (ie, the
number of times RC garlic was consumed in a given time period)
into grams consumed per week, one serving size was considered
to equal one clove of garlic, or ⬇3 g. Average differences in RC
garlic  consumption  between  the  highest  category  of  intake  and
the  reference  group  were  computed  by  assigning  a  midrange
dose to each category and averaging values across all reports.

Fixed-  and  random-effects  estimates  were  computed  by
using  inverse  variance  weighting  (Table  5)  (26, 28).  Fixed-
effects  estimates  assume  that  the  effect  measures  in  the  study
populations have a uniform value. Random-effects estimates do
not  assume  that  the  effect  measures  are  uniform  across  study
populations (26, 28); an additional component of among-study
variance  is  added  to  each  study-specific  variance  estimate.
Tests  of  homogeneity  were  conducted  for  each  meta-analysis.
The P values are presented in Table 5.

Seven  meta-analyses  were  performed.  The  first  aggregated
all cancer sites and included data from 20 studies; the studies
that examined total Allium vegetable consumption were excluded
because  these  reports  examined  the  combination  of  Allium
vegetable  and  RC  garlic  consumption  (18, 20).  Two  separate
RR  estimates  for  males  and  females  from  the  studies  by  Le
Marchand et al (12) and Zheng et al (19) were used. A second
meta-analysis of all cancers was performed, excluding 4 cohort
studies of the relation between garlic supplement consumption
and  cancers  of  the  stomach, colon, lung, and  breast.  These
4 studies, all  published  by  Dorant  et  al  (10, 16, 23, 24),
analyzed one population—the Netherlands follow-up cohort.
Site-specific  meta-analyses  were  subsequently  conducted  on
colorectal and stomach cancers. Three separate meta-analyses
of the colorectal cancer studies were conducted: one included
all  8  of  these  studies, one  included  all  8  of  these  studies
except  that  by  Dorant  et  al  (16), and  one  included  all  8  of
these studies except those by Dorant et al (16) and Iscovich et
al (11). The latter study examined the relation between cancer
risk and the combined consumption of RC garlic, peppers, and
onions. A similar procedure was used for the studies of stomach
cancer.  All  5  stomach  cancer  studies  were  aggregated  for

analysis, and then a separate analysis was made after the study

RESULTS

The funnel plot suggests a deficit of studies with a low number
of subjects with results indicating a positive association between
RC garlic consumption and cancer risk (Figure 1). This was fur-
ther evidenced in the log-rank test by Begg and Mazumdar (27)
for all studies of RC garlic and cancer risk (n = 17; P = 0.049).

The results of the meta-analyses are presented in Table 5. The
mean (± SD) intake of the highest consumers of RC garlic across
all  published  reports  was  18.3 ± 14.2  g/wk, or  ⬇6  cloves  gar-
lic/wk. In the meta-analyses of colorectal and stomach cancer, the
reference  categories  of  RC  garlic  consumption  ranged  from  no
consumption to consumption of 3.5 g/wk (⬇1 clove), whereas the
highest categories of RC garlic intake ranged from any consump-
tion  to  > 28.8  g/wk  (⬇9–10  cloves). The  difference  between  the
midrange dose of the highest consumption categories and the mid-
range dose of the reference groups was ⬇16 g/wk (⬇5–6 cloves).
Each meta-analysis, except for the most reduced colorectal model
(n = 6;  2-sided  homogeneity;  P = 0.17), yielded  considerable
evidence of heterogeneity (P < 0.0001 to 0.02). As a result of the
limited number of studies, a meta-regression using the aforemen-
tioned extracted variables was not performed.

Given  these  limitations, the  random-effects  RR  estimate  for
all sites of cancer represented in the literature, after removal of
the 4 garlic-supplement studies, was 0.54 (95% CI: 0.43, 0.67).
The  random-effects  estimate  for  the  reduced  colorectal  model

(n = 6) was 0.69 (95% CI: 0.55, 0.89). This suggests that high
consumption of RC garlic decreases the risk of colorectal cancer
from  10%  to  nearly  50%, with  a  point  estimate  of  an  approxi-
mate 30% reduction. The random-effects RR estimate from the
stomach cancer model was 0.53 (95% CI: 0.31, 0.92), ie, the RR
of developing stomach cancer was reduced by ⬇ 50% (95% CI:
10%, 70%) with a high consumption of RC garlic.

DISCUSSION

The published epidemiologic evidence suggests that protec-
tion  against  stomach  and  colorectal  cancers  is  conferred  by
consumption  of  RC  garlic.  Because  the  studies  we  reviewed
were observational, and many did not control for other dietary
differences, a review of interventional studies may be required
to confirm the effect, especially because garlic supplements did
not  show  a  similar  association. Although  the  mean  consump-
tion in the highest categories in all the studies was reported, it
is unclear what the minimum dose of garlic necessary to elicit
a  protective  effect  might  be  because  there  was  great  hetero-
geneity of frequency categories among the highest categories,
and some reports did not provide quantitative cutoffs. Evidence
of heterogeneity of RC garlic intake among studies is not evi-
dence against an effect; rather, it suggests that there are appre-
ciable  differences  among  the  results  beyond  those  expected
from chance and thus that a single summary estimate does not
adequately  reflect  the  literature.  It  can  be  argued  that  these
studies may be subject to biases and that the sample sizes at the
higher  exposure  levels  were  too  small.  Thus, the  strongest

with null or positive (RR estimate > 1.0) results. If the funnel plot
for all studies, both published and unpublished, had the symmet-
ric  shape  expected  by  chance, the  summary  estimates  of  effect
would be closer to the null value.

In addition to evidence of publication bias, interpretation of
these  meta-analyses  is  further  limited  by  other  considerations.
First, the full cancer model should not be considered represen-
tative  of  all  cancers  because  the  literature  heavily  favors  colo-
rectal and stomach cancers; other cancer sites were scant or not
represented. The most homogeneous models of colorectal cancer
(n = 6) and stomach cancer (n = 4) consist of only a small num-
ber  of  reports.  Furthermore, the  stomach  cancer  model  of  RC
garlic consumption consists of only 4 case-control studies. The
RR  estimates  for  both  stomach  and  colorectal  cancers  never
exceeded  1.0  for  the  highest  level  of  RC  garlic  consumption
compared with the lowest, suggesting either a protective associ-
ation across all reports or publication bias.

It  is  possible  that  residual  confounding  accounts  for  some
degree of the association because several reports did not con-
trol for total vegetable consumption, the known risk factors for
these diseases, or both. Promising results for a potentially pro-
tective effect of RC garlic consumption against prostate, laryn-
geal, and breast cancers were observed, although these results
were based on only 4 case-control studies. There was divergent
evidence to support a relation with esophageal cancer, in which
one smaller report showed a protective effect whereas the other
2 showed no association.

On visual inspection of the few studies of garlic supplements,
there appeared to be no association with risk of cancer. A positive
relation  was  reported  for  exclusive  users  of  garlic  supplements
and risk of lung cancer. This result may be either a spurious asso-
ciation or the outcome of a physiologic or behavioral interaction
with known risk factors for lung cancer, such as smoking. Garlic
supplement use has been associated with higher levels of educa-
tion, physical  activity, health  complaints, and  recent  dietary
change (29). Further research of the association between garlic
supplement consumption and cancer risk is necessary before any
definitive conclusions can be made (30).

An  alternative  hypothesis, which  may  explain  the  consistent
effect seen in meta-analysis, is the protective effect of total veg-
etable  consumption  against  cancers  of  the  stomach  and  colon
(31). Total vegetable consumption may be positively correlated

and prostate cancers. RR, relative risk; OR, odds ratio.

evidence for a protective effect of RC garlic consumption exists
for stomach and colorectal cancers.

Unlike evidence of heterogeneity, evidence of publication bias
does  detract  from  the  evidence  of  an  effect.  Publication  bias
almost undoubtedly inﬂuenced the results, particularly for stom-
ach and colon cancers, for which several studies were available for
analysis. The funnel plot indicated that the apparently protective
effect  found  between  RC  garlic  consumption  and  cancers  of  the
stomach  and  colon  may  have  been  overestimated  or, in  extreme
cases, entirely due to an absence in the published record of reports

with  RC  garlic  consumption.  In  addition, garlic  is  most  often
used  as  a  condiment  in  recipes  and  dishes  such  as  pasta  sauce
and is rarely consumed as a single food. Because of the absence
of  information  on  total  vegetable  consumption  in  the  present
meta-analyses, it was not controlled for. The random-effects RR
estimates presented are adjusted inasmuch as the individual stud-
ies controlled for confounding factors. No further adjustment for
confounders  was  made  in  the  meta-analyses.  However, except
for one study (13) in which the RR estimate was unadjusted, the
estimates included in the meta-analysis were the most-adjusted
estimates presented in the studies. Typical adjustments were for
known cancer confounders such as age, sex, and other factors.

In the present meta-analyses, the inverse association between
RC garlic consumption and stomach and colorectal cancers was
consistent.  In  contrast, garlic  supplement  consumption  in  one
case-control study of prostate cancer and in 4 studies from the
Netherlands  cohort  of  colorectal, stomach, lung, and  breast
cancers did not appear to be associated with cancer risk. Addi-
tional studies are required before definitive conclusions can be
drawn about the role of RC garlic and garlic supplement con-
sumption in cancer etiology.

We  thank  Neal  Simonsen  for  reviewing  the  manuscript  and  E  Buiatti  and
L Le Marchand for contributing data additional to those of their published reports.
