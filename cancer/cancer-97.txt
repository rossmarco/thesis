Background
We  tested  the  hypothesis  that  die-
tary intervention can inhibit the development of re-
current  colorectal  adenomas,  which  are  precursors
of most large-bowel cancers.
Methods
We  randomly  assigned  2079  men  and
women who were 35 years of age or older and who
had had one or more histologically confirmed colo-
rectal adenomas removed within six months before
randomization to one of two groups: an intervention
group  given  intensive  counseling  and  assigned  to
follow a diet that was low in fat (20 percent of total
calories) and high in fiber (18 g of dietary fiber per
1000 kcal) and fruits and vegetables (3.5 servings per
1000 kcal), and a control group given a standard bro-
chure on healthy eating and assigned to follow their
usual diet. Subjects entered the study after undergo-
ing complete colonoscopy and removal of adenom-
atous polyps; they remained in the study for approx-
imately four years, undergoing colonoscopy one and
four years after randomization.
Results
A total of 1905 of the randomized subjects
(91.6 percent) completed the study. Of the 958 subjects
in the intervention group and the 947 in the control
group  who  completed  the  study,  39.7  percent  and
39.5 percent, respectively, had at least one recurrent
adenoma; the unadjusted risk ratio was 1.00 (95 per-
cent confidence interval, 0.90 to 1.12). Among subjects
with recurrent adenomas, the mean (±SE) number of
such lesions was 1.85±0.08 in the intervention group
and 1.84±0.07 in the control group. The rate of recur-
rence of large adenomas (with a maximal diameter
of at least 1 cm) and advanced adenomas (defined as
lesions that had a maximal diameter of at least 1 cm
or at least 25 percent villous elements or evidence of
high-grade  dysplasia,  including  carcinoma)  did  not
differ significantly between the two groups.
Conclusions
Adopting a diet that is low in fat and
high  in  fiber,  fruits,  and  vegetables  does  not  influ-
ence the risk of recurrence of colorectal adenomas.

influence carcinogenesis.
 Observational epidemio-

and dietary fat increases the risk of colorectal cancer,
whereas the ingestion of vegetables, dietary fiber, and
certain micronutrients lowers the risk.
 These re-

conclusive.

We studied whether adults can reduce their risk of
colorectal cancer by modifying their diet. Because ad-
enomatous polyps are considered precursors of most
large-bowel cancers, we chose recurrence of adenomas
as the primary end point.

Some earlier trials tested the effects of dietary sup-
plements, rather than an explicit dietary change, on
the recurrence of adenomas.
 Two pioneering stud-
ies did not find that low-fat diets (coupled with fiber
supplementation) reduced the recurrence of adeno-
mas,
 but these small trials had limited statistical
power. We report the results of the Polyp Prevention
Trial, a large multicenter, randomized, controlled trial
of  the  effect  of  a  comprehensive  dietary  interven-
tion — counseling of patients and assignment to a
diet low in fat and high in fiber, fruits, and vegeta-
bles — on the recurrence of large-bowel adenomas.

METHODS

Study Design and Subjects

25,26

Details of the study design, eligibility criteria, randomization pro-
cedures, dietary intervention, and end-point assessment have been
previously reported.
 In brief, we recruited subjects who were
at least 35 years old and who had had one or more histologically
confirmed colorectal adenomas removed during a qualifying co-
lonoscopy (in which the cecum was visualized, all polyps were re-
moved, and the bowel was adequately prepared) within six months
before randomization. Eligible subjects had no history of colorectal
cancer, surgical resection of adenomas, bowel resection, the poly-
posis syndrome, or inflammatory bowel disease; weighed no more
than 150 percent of the recommended level; were taking no lipid-
lowering drugs; and had no medical condition or dietary restrictions
or practices that would substantially limit compliance with the pro-
tocol. The institutional review boards of the National Cancer In-
stitute and each participating center approved the study. All sub-
jects provided written informed consent.

Staff members at eight clinical centers (listed in the Appendix)
identified potential subjects through referrals by endoscopists or re-
views of the records of the endoscopy service. Of 38,277 poten-
tial subjects, we enrolled 2079 (5.4 percent) in the trial. A total of
1037 were randomly assigned to adopt a diet that was low in fat
and high in fiber, fruits, and vegetables (the intervention group),
and 1042 were randomly assigned to follow their usual diet (the
control  group).  The  base-line  characteristics  of  these  subjects
have been reported previously.

25,26

Collection of Data

At one of two clinic visits before randomization, we measured
each subject’s weight and height. At the base-line visit and at sub-
sequent annual visits at years 1, 2, 3, and 4, each subject answered
a questionnaire assessing a variety of demographic, clinical, and be-
havioral characteristics and provided a venous blood specimen after
an overnight fast.

Dietary Goals and Follow-up

For subjects in the intervention group, the dietary goals were
to provide 20 percent of total calories from fat, 18 g of dietary
fiber per 1000 kcal, and 3.5 servings of fruits and vegetables per
1000 kcal (range, 5 to 8 daily servings, depending on total energy
intake). The intervention program included nutritional informa-
tion and behavior-modification techniques. We offered each sub-
ject more than 50 hours of counseling sessions during the four-
year intervention period, including 20 hours in the first year. Each
subject in the intervention group was assigned to one nutritionist
for counseling and another for dietary assessment. We provided
subjects in the control group with general dietary guidelines from
the National Dairy Council but gave them no additional nutrition-
al or behavioral information.

We followed the subjects for approximately four years after ran-
domization. Each year all subjects completed a four-day food record
followed by a food-frequency questionnaire, the Block Health Hab-

1150

its and History Questionnaire,
 which was modified slightly to
reflect the intake of low-fat and high-fiber foods. In addition, sub-
jects in the intervention group completed a four-day food record
six months after randomization. Each year we administered un-
scheduled 24-hour dietary-recall questionnaires to a newly select-
ed random sample of 10 percent of subjects.

Colonoscopy

Subjects  returned  to  their  usual  endoscopist  for  colonoscopy
one and four years after randomization. The one-year colonoscopy
had to be performed at least 180 days after randomization but less
than 2 years afterward. This colonoscopy served to detect and re-
move any lesions missed by the base-line colonoscopy. We obtained
data on any unscheduled endoscopic procedure carried out in ad-
dition to the follow-up procedures at one and four years. We asked
all investigators and subjects not to discuss a subject’s randomiza-
tion status with the endoscopists.

Assessment of Adenomas

Two  central  pathologists,  who  were  unaware  of  the  subjects’
group assignment, determined the histologic features and degree of
atypia (low-grade vs. high-grade) of all lesions. The endoscopists’
reports provided information on the size, number, and location
of all polyps.

We defined an adenoma as recurrent if it was found during any
endoscopic procedure after the one-year colonoscopy or, for sub-
jects who missed the one-year colonoscopy, during any endoscopic
procedure performed at least two years after randomization. Ad-
enomas found during the one-year colonoscopy were not consid-
ered  recurrent.  An  end-points  committee  of  gastroenterologists
who were unaware of the subjects’ group assignment evaluated com-
plicated cases, including those involving lost tissue specimens or
failure to reach the cecum. The few colorectal cancers diagnosed
after the one-year colonoscopy were counted as recurrent lesions.

Statistical Analysis

29

We used the intention-to-treat principle to compare the inter-
vention and control groups, defining groups according to the ini-
tial random assignment rather than according to actual or report-
ed compliance with the protocol.
 The primary end point was the
recurrence of adenomas during the interval from the one-year to
the four-year colonoscopy. Secondary end points were the num-
ber, size, location, and histologic features of the adenomas that
were found. We calculated risk ratios and 95 percent confidence in-
tervals in order to compare end-point events in the two groups.
30
We used logistic regression to adjust the effect of intervention for
base-line prognostic factors. We used logistic-regression models to
determine whether there was an interaction between dietary in-
tervention and various covariates, and where appropriate, we per-
formed covariate stratum-specific analyses.

RESULTS

Characteristics of the Subjects

The  base-line  demographic,  clinical,  nutritional,
and behavioral characteristics were similar in the 958
subjects in the intervention group and the 947 sub-
jects in the control group who completed the study
(Table 1). Of these 1905 subjects, 1768 (92.8 per-
cent) underwent a colonoscopy during year 1; the pro-
cedure was performed in 93.8 percent of the subjects
in  the  intervention  group  and  91.8  percent  of  the
subjects in the control group (Table 2). The median
observation period (3.05 years) and the mean num-
ber of colonoscopic examinations after randomization
(2.31) were the same in both groups (Table 2).

Subjects in the intervention group reduced their

*The reasons for withdrawal were as follows: no colonoscopy at year 4 in
29 subjects in the intervention group and 43 subjects in the control group;
refusal to participate in the case of 5 and 4 subjects, respectively; and illness
in 1 subject in the control group.

†Among  subjects  in  the  intervention  group  who  underwent  follow-up
colonoscopy, in 38 the cecum was not visualized; in 22 the bowel was poor-
ly prepared, which might have caused small polyps to be overlooked; and in
53 one or more tissue specimens were lost during the procedure and there-
fore were not analyzed, no slides were available for pathological review, or
data on histologic findings were unknown. The respective numbers in the
control group were 40, 25, and 44. Five subjects (three in the intervention
group and two in the control group) underwent sigmoidoscopy as the fol-
low-up procedure.

‡P=0.10 for the difference between groups.

Subjects in the intervention group raised their fi-
ber intake by nearly 75 percent; subjects in the con-
trol group had a slight increase (Table 3). By the end
of the study, the difference between the two groups
in the change in fiber consumption was 6.9 g of di-
etary fiber per 1000 kcal (95 percent confidence in-
terval, 6.4 to 7.3). As compared with subjects in the
control group, those in the intervention group who
consumed 2000 kcal per day increased their fiber in-
take by nearly 14 g on average. Data from the four-
day food records were similar to those from the food-
frequency questionnaires.

The number of servings of fruits and vegetables per
1000 kcal increased by about two thirds in the in-
tervention group; subjects in the control group raised
their fruit and vegetable intake only slightly (Table 3).
The difference between the two groups in the change
in  fruit  and  vegetable  intake  was 1.13  servings  per
1000  kcal  (95  percent  confidence  interval, 1.04  to
1.21). As compared with subjects in the control group,
subjects  in  the  intervention  group  who  consumed
2000 kcal per day increased their fruit and vegetable
intake by approximately 2.25 servings. Data from the

four-day  food  records  showed  a  difference  in  the
change between groups of 1.8 servings per 1000 kcal.
Changes in the intake of fat, fiber, and fruits and
vegetables generally occurred within the first year and
were subsequently maintained. Data from the food-
frequency questionnaire showed that during the first
year subjects in the intervention group obtained 24.6
percent of calories from fat, consumed 17.7 g of die-
tary fiber per 1000 kcal, and ate 3.3 servings of fruits
and  vegetables  per 1000  kcal.  These  changes  were
similar for men and women. As compared with sub-
jects in the control group, subjects in the interven-
tion group also significantly altered their intake of oth-
er nutrients and foods, including red and processed
meat, whole grains, legumes, calcium, and folate (Ta-
ble 3). Data from the 24-hour dietary recall were sim-
ilar to those from the four-day food records.

Over the four-year period of observation, the sub-
jects in the intervention group had a significant in-
crease  in  serum  carotenoid  concentrations  and  de-
crease in weight (Table 3), as compared with changes
measured in subjects in the control group. The small
reductions in plasma total cholesterol concentrations
did not differ significantly between the two groups.
The  differences  in  the  changes  in  total  cholesterol,
total carotenoids, and weight (calculated as the change
in the control group over time minus the change in
the  intervention  group  over  time)  were  somewhat
greater after one year than after four years.

cent of subjects in the intervention group and 39.5
percent of subjects in the control group; the unad-
justed risk ratio was 1.00 (95 percent confidence in-
terval, 0.90 to 1.12; P=0.98) (Table 4). Of these re-
current adenomas, the mean number was 1.85±0.08
in the intervention group and 1.84±0.07 in the con-
trol group (P=0.93). Among the 638 subjects in the
intervention group and 550 subjects in the control
group who underwent colonoscopy only at year 1 and
year  4  after  randomization,  36.7  percent  and  35.8
percent, respectively, had one or more recurrent ade-
nomas; the unadjusted risk ratio was 1.02 (95 per-
cent confidence interval, 0.88 to 1.19; P=0.81).

The intervention and control groups did not dif-
fer significantly with respect to the number with re-
current  large  adenomas  (with  a  maximal  diameter
of at least 1 cm) or advanced adenomas (defined as
those that had a maximal diameter of at least 1 cm
or at least 25 percent villous elements or evidence of
high-grade dysplasia, including carcinoma); this was
true when the analysis included all those who com-
pleted the study (Table 4) as well as when it included
those who underwent only the scheduled colonos-
copies at year 1 and year 4 after randomization (data
not shown). In both groups, approximately 27 per-
cent of subjects had at least one recurrent adenoma
proximal to the splenic flexure (Table 4). Sixty-three
percent of recurrent adenomas were proximal to the
splenic flexure, whereas 58 percent of base-line ade-
nomas were distal to that site (data not shown).

Colorectal cancer was diagnosed in 14 subjects af-
ter randomization (10 in the intervention group and
4  in  the  control  group);  the  unadjusted  risk  ratio
was 2.5 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.8 to 7.9;
P=0.19). Of these 14 subjects, 6 (4 in the intervention
group and 2 in the control group) were given a diag-
nosis after the one-year colonoscopy; the unadjusted
risk  ratio  was  2.0  (95  percent  confidence  interval,
0.4 to 10.8; P=0.69).

To adjust for an imbalance in influential base-line
variables between the groups, we used logistic-regres-
sion models that included as covariates the random
group assignment and the base-line characteristics list-
ed in Table 1. Adjustment for these factors had no
effect on the risk of recurrence.

For all but one of the covariates listed in Table 1,
we found on logistic-regression analysis that there was
no statistically significant (P<0.01) interaction with
group assignment. We observed a significant interac-
tion (P=0.005 before adjustment for multiple com-
parisons) between the randomization group and sex.
We therefore examined the recurrence of adenomas
among men and women separately. Among men, the
recurrence rate was lower in the intervention group
than in the control group (41.9 percent vs. 46.7 per-
cent); the unadjusted risk ratio was 0.89 (95 percent
confidence interval, 0.79 to 1.02; P=0.11). Among
women, the rate of recurrence was higher in the in-
tervention group than in the control group (35.4 per-
cent vs. 27.2 percent); the unadjusted risk ratio was

1.30 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.04 to 1.63;
P=0.03). With respect to both large and advanced
recurrent lesions, the differences between groups were
not significant for either men or women; the inter-
action between the randomization group and sex was
not significant for either end point. There were also no
significant (P<0.05) differences between the groups
in  the  number  of  either  deaths  or  hospitalizations
(for all causes and for specific diagnoses).

DISCUSSION

We found that the rate of recurrent adenomas was
not changed by dietary intervention. Our results are
compatible with, at most, an absolute reduction re-
lated to the intervention of about 4 percent in the
incidence of recurrent adenomas (Table 4). We also
found no effect of the dietary intervention on the in-
cidence of large or advanced recurrent lesions.

Two previous trials also found that dietary changes
had no effect on the overall risk of recurrence of co-
lorectal adenomas. The Toronto Polyp Prevention Tri-
al reported no significant difference in recurrence af-
ter  two  years  between  subjects  in  the  intervention
group and those in the control group (a total of 201
subjects) who reported ingesting 25 and 33 percent
of calories from fat and 35 and 16 g of fiber per day,
respectively.23  In  the  Australian  Polyp  Prevention
Project, which included 424 subjects, none of the in-
terventions (a reduction in dietary fat, use of a wheat-
bran–fiber  supplement,  and  supplementation  with
beta carotene) resulted in a statistically significant re-
duction in the risk of recurrence after 48 months of
observation.24 The Australian trial did report a mar-
ginally significant reduction in the recurrence of large
adenomas (»1 cm in diameter) among subjects eat-
ing a low-fat diet, but in that study large recurrent
adenomas  developed  in  only  17  subjects,  as  com-
pared with 100 in our study.

The straightforward interpretation of our finding is
that a diet that is low in fat, and high in fiber, fruits,
and vegetables does not reduce the risk of recurrent
adenomas or, by inference, colorectal cancer. Alter-
native explanations, however, merit consideration.

Most recurrent adenomas were small; only about
5 percent of subjects had a recurrent lesion 1 cm or
more in diameter (Table 4). Adopting a diet that was
low  in  fat  and  high  in  fiber,  fruits,  and  vegetables
might affect only the growth of small adenomas into
large adenomas or the transformation of large ade-
nomas into invasive carcinomas.31

The dietary-assessment data indicated that the in-
tervention and control groups differed substantially
in the consumption of fat, fiber, and fruits and veg-
etables. The findings regarding carotenoid concentra-
tions and weight were consistent with such differenc-
es. (The changes in blood lipid concentrations were
minimal but compatible with the results of other stud-
ies of dietary intervention as well as with predictions

1154 · Apr il 20, 2000

based on the equation of Keys et al.32) These data,
however, do not preclude the possibility that in the
light of the dietary expectations fostered by the trial,
subjects in the intervention group systematically un-
derreported their intake of fat or overreported their
consumption  of  fiber  or  fruits  and  vegetables.  An-
other possibility is that the dietary intervention was
inadequate; a reduction in fat intake to no more than
15 percent of calories or a greater intake of fiber or
fruits and vegetables might be required to reduce the
risk  of  recurrent  adenomas.  Moreover,  we  may  not
have chosen the optimal set of dietary targets. The 20
percent  reduction  in  the  consumption  of  red  and
processed meat among subjects in the intervention
group may have been too small to affect the risk of
recurrence of adenomas. The same may be true for
reductions  in  the  consumption  of  meat  cooked  at
high temperatures (which contains high concentra-
tions of heterocyclic amines)33 or sugar.11

The mean age of the subjects at base line was 61
years.  If  nutritional  factors  influence  critical  events
in colorectal neoplasia at the molecular, cellular, or
tissue level only earlier in life, then a change in diet
later in adult life may be ineffective. A relatively short
period of dietary intervention (four years) might also
fail to reduce the risk of recurrent adenomas. A longer
period of intervention as well as follow-up might al-
low the development of enough adenomas to reveal
the protective effect of the intervention, if there were
one. In a recent clinical trial of calcium supplementa-
tion to prevent colorectal adenoma,22 however, the av-
erage age of the subjects, the duration of the interven-
tion, and the length of follow-up were similar to those
in our study, but that study did find a lower recur-
rence rate among subjects in the intervention group.
Bias is an unlikely explanation for our results. Sub-
jects in the intervention and control groups who com-
pleted the study did not differ appreciably with re-
spect to base-line characteristics, and the main results
did not change after adjustment for multiple covari-
ates in logistic-regression analysis. Although we could
not  disguise  the  group  assignments  from  the  sub-
jects or guarantee that the endoscopists were unaware
of these assignments, we have no reason to suspect
that  endoscopists  tended  to  search  more  diligently
for — and therefore find more — adenomas among
subjects in the intervention group than in the control
group. A series of imputations based on the age and
sex of subjects who did not undergo follow-up co-
lonoscopy made no appreciable difference in estimates
of recurrence.34

The  higher  rate  of  recurrent  adenomas  among
women in the intervention group than among those
in the control group and the interaction between sex
and group was not affected by a multivariate adjust-
ment for age and the number of adenomas at base line
(both of which were predictive of the risk of recur-
rence) and other covariates listed in Table 1. Never-

theless, we conclude that this interaction resulted from
chance  observations  arising  from  repeated  testing.
In the Toronto trial, the rate of recurrence was lower
among women in the intervention group but higher
among men in that group, as compared with the risk
in the control subjects, though these differences were
not statistically significant.23

In summary, our study provided no evidence that
a diet low in fat and high in fiber, fruits, and vegeta-
bles reduces the risk of recurrent colorectal adeno-
mas.  Nevertheless,  we  cannot  definitively  conclude
that  a  change  in  diet  is  ineffective  in  reducing  the
risk of colorectal cancer. Nor should we overlook the
abundant data indicating that a diet low in saturated
fats and rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains has
a favorable influence on the risk of chronic disease
and mortality.35-37
