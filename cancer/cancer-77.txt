MATERIALS AND METHODS

background,

of respondents

The Lutheran Brotherhood Cohort. In 1966. a cohort (n = 26,030) of
white male policy holders of the Lutheran Brotherhood
Insurance
Society who were at least 35 years of age was selected for a mortality
follow-up study (median age at entry into the cohort, 51). In September
1966, a questionnaire was mailed to members of the cohort with
questions on demographic
frequency of use of dietary
items, and tobacco habits. A response rate of 68.5% was achieved after
three mailings. A comparison
and nonrespondents,
using original
insurance records, found little difference in age, urban/
rural residence, or policy status (24).

Since the LBS2 cohort was a self-selected group, having purchased
life insurance, several characteristics of the cohort members were dif
ferent
from those of the United States population. The cohort was
primarily from the upper midwest, particularly Minnesota, and north
eastern areas of the United States (45 and 39%, respectively), with 30%
of Norwegian and other Scandinavian heritage.
In addition, compared
to United States white males in the mid-1960s,
the LBS cohort was
more rural (37 versus 29%). and more were farmers (38 versus 4%) (25).
Mortality. The LBS cohort was followed for mortality from 1966 to
1986. for a total of 286,731 person-years. Death certificates, which
were received semiannually from the Lutheran Brotherhood Insurance
Society, were coded for underlying cause of death, all other contributory
causes of death, and all other significant conditions by the nosologist
of the Minnesota State Department
of Health. During the 20-year
follow-up, 4513 deaths,
including 1033 cancer deaths, were identified.
The two major causes of death were heart disease and cancer. Among
the cancer deaths,
the distribution of anatomic sites was similar to that
among United States males, with the most common being malignancies
of the lung (n = 203), prostate (n = 149). and large intestine (n = 120).
The overall mortality experience of this cohort was similar to that of
United States white males, although the number of prostate cancer
deaths was slightly lower than expected (standard mortality ratio. 0.92)
(26). During the follow-up, 4027 subjects (23%) were lost to follow-up
due to lapsed policies or discontinuation
of policies after premium
maturity. A comparison of cancer mortality at 11.5 years of follow-up
showed no significant differences between original
and
nonrespondents

and those whose policies lapsed (24).

respondents

Tobacco and Alcohol. Information on tobacco use. including the use
of cigarettes, pipes, cigars, and smokeless
tobacco (snuff or tobacco
chewing), was elicited in the 1966 questionnaire. Since no subsequent
information on tobacco use was obtained,
smoking exposure in the
analysis pertained to the smoking experience of cohort members
in
1966. Thus, current smokers were defined as those smoking in 1966.
Information on the use of beer and whiskey was also asked in the 1966
questionnaire:
persons who used either beer or liquor (whiskey, gin,
cognac, etc.) at least 6 times a year were defined as users.

Dietary Data. The respondents were asked about

the frequency of
their current
(in 1966) monthly intake of foods. Thirty-five individual
food items, including vegetables (potatoes, cabbage, rutabagas, carrots.

One hundred eighty-five individuals were excluded because they had
more than 10 unknown responses
to the food item questions. The
excluded individuals were older, more likely to reside in rural areas,
and less educated as compared to the 17,633 subjects who remained in
the final analysis. For the included subjects. 71% had no missing data
on any food items; of the remaining 29% (87% of whom had fewer
than 5 items missing), we imputed intake for missing food items, using
the median values of the remaining subjects, stratified by urban/rural,
education, and age categories. The imputation is unlikely to greatly
affect the nutrient analysis, since, for example,
it contributed to only
about 1% of the vitamin A index. Consumption of food groups and
nutrients was divided into quartiles based on the intake of all 17.633
subjects.
