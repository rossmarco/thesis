Background:  Experimental  animal  studies suggest  that  olive
oil  consumption,  as  contrasted  to  consumption  of  other  fat
types,  does  not  enhance  the  occurrence  of  chemically  in-
duced  mammary  tumors,  but  human  data  are  sparse.  Fur-
thermore,  evidence  is  inconclusive  concerning  the  role  of
food  groups, as distinct  from  that of major  nutrients, in the
etiology  of  breast  cancer  in  women. Purpose:  This  analysis
was  conducted  to  evaluate  and  quantify  the  effect  of  con-
sumption of olive oil, margarine, and a range of food  groups
on  the  risk  of  breast  cancer.  Methods:  Data  from  a  com-
prehensive,  semiquantitative  food-frequency  questionnaire
administered  to  820  women  with  breast  cancer  and  1548
control  women  from  the  study  base  were  used  to  calculate
odds ratios (ORs) and A' statistics of linear trend for the con-
sumption  of olive oil, margarine, and a series of food  groups
classified 
the  effects  of
for 
reproductive  risk 
intake,  and  mutual
confounding  influences  was  implemented  through  uncondi-
tional  logistic  regression  modeling.  Results:  Vegetable  con-
sumption  and 
independently
associated  with  statistically  significant  reductions  of  breast
cancer  risk  by  12%  and  8%,  respectively,  per  quintile  in-
crease; no significant  associations were evident for the other
food  groups examined.  Increased  olive oil  consumption  was
associated  with significantly  reduced  breast cancer  risk  (OR
=  0.75  [95%  confidence  interval  = 0.57-0.98]  for  more  than
once a day versus once a day), whereas increased  margarine
consumption  was associated  with significantly  increased  risk
(OR  =  1.05  [95%  confidence  interval  =  1.00-1.10]  for  an
increment  of  four  times  a  month). The  olive  oil  association
was  apparently 
concentrated  among  postmenopausal
women, but the relevant interaction  term was not statistical-
ly  significant;  there  was  no  suggestion  of  interaction  with
menopausal  status  for  consumption  of  either  vegetables,
fruits,  or  margarine.  Conclusions:  Although  major  categor-
ies  of  macronutrients  do  not  show  significant  associations
with breast cancer risk in most studies, including the present
one,  vegetables  and  fruits  are  inversely,  significantly,  and
strongly associated with this risk. There also is evidence that
olive  oil  consumption  may  reduce  the  risk  of  breast  cancer,
whereas  margarine  intake  appears  to  be associated  with  an
elevated  risk for the disease. [J Natl Cancer Inst 87:110-116,
1995]

The evidence concerning  an inverse association  between con-
sumption  of  vegetables  and  fruits  on  the  one  hand  and  breast
cancer risk on the other is generally  considered  inconclusive (1-
3),  although a meta-analysis  (4) has reported  a protective  effect.
There  are  several  reasons  for  the  widespread  hesitation  to  at-
tribute  a  major  protective  role  to  fruits  and  vegetables  in  the
context  of breast cancer.  Early  case-control  studies  on diet  and
breast cancer  [reviewed  by Steinmetz and Potter (3)] did not ac-
count  for  energy  intake  in  the  analysis;  adjustment  for  energy
intake (5,6) controls for the consequences of general overreport-
ing or underreporting by case patients of their food  consumption
in case-control  investigations (7). Furthermore, since the impor-
tance of energy  intake as a critical  factor  in epidemiologic  anal-
yses  was  recognized  and  procedures  to  account  for  it  were
formulated  (5,6,8),  the  emphasis  has  moved  away  from  food
items  and  food  groups  to  macronutrients  and  micronutrients
believed  to represent  the  biologically  active  ingredients  (9-11).
This  approach  is justifiable  in  certain  geographic  and  cultural
settings  where  dietary  supplements  are  extensively  used  (12).
However,  this  approach  may  not  be  appropriate  in  other  situa-
tions, since the protective effect,  if any, of vegetables and  fruits
could  be  mediated  by  factors  biologically  independent  of  their
content in fiber  or antioxidant vitamins (13). Another reason  for
the diminished  interest in vegetables and fruits  as potentially im-
portant  factors  in  cancer  etiology  and  prevention  is  that  the
scientific  and  public  debate  on  the  nutritional  etiology  of  this
disease  has focused  on  the  possible  role  of  fat  and  on  the  most

tulated role (10,14,15).

A  similar  issue  may  have  hindered  the  evaluation  of  poten-
tially  different  effects  of  various  types  of  fat  on  breast  cancer
risk.  Most  major  studies  and  meta-analyses  have  concentrated
on  total  fat  as  well  as  on  saturated,  monounsaturated,  and
polyunsaturated  fat  and have found  only  minor quantitative  dif-
ferences  among  the  fat  type-specific  measures  of  association
with breast cancer  risk  (10,16,17). However, evidence  from  ex-
perimental  studies in animals (18-21) suggests that consumption
of  olive  oil  per  se, as contrasted  to that  of  other  fat  types, may
not  enhance  the  yield  of  various  types  of  tumors,  including
breast  cancer.  Moreover,  in  Mediterranean  countries  monoun-
saturated fats  reflect  mostly olive oil, whereas in North  America
they are derived mostly from other foods, in particular meat.

In  this  article,  we have  analyzed  the  data  from  a  large  case-
control  study  undertaken  in Greece,  in order  to assess the inde-
pendent  associations  with  breast  cancer  risk  of  consumption  of
vegetables, fruits,  other food  groups, and types of  fat  according
to their origin (i.e., olive oil, butter, seed oils, and margarine). In
previously  published  papers based  on  these data,  there  were  no
statistically  significant,  consistent, or substantial  associations of
breast  cancer  risk  with  any  of  the  macronutrients  (saturated,
monounsaturated,  or  polyunsaturated  fat,  carbohydrates,  or
protein)  (22), although  ethanol  intake  of  more  than  30 g/d  was
associated  with  a  small  but  statistically  significant  elevation  in
risk (25).

Subjects and Methods

During a 3-year  period  (1989-1991), all women  with newly diagnosed  breast
cancer,  admitted  in  four  major  hospitals  in  the  greater  Athens  area,  were  iden-
tified.  Of  the  873 histologically  confirmed  cases,  820 were eventually  included
in the  study  (94% participation  rate). Each  case  patient  was  interviewed  in  the
hospital  before  her  first  discharge.  For  each  case  patient,  two  control  subjects
were identified:  One was from  among hospital  visitors in the same hospital  (not

including first-degree relatives or women  who ever had breast cancer); the other
was from  among orthopedic  patients  from  the major accident  hospital of  Athens
or Piraeus (depending on the residence of the case patient). Each control  subject
had to be within ±5 years of the age of the index case patient and  from  the same
area  of  residence.  Eight  hundred  thirty  eligible  hospital  control  subjects  were
identified,  of  whom  795 (96%) were  interviewed;  similarly, 808 eligible  visitor
controls were  identified,  of  whom  753 (93%) were  interviewed. Thus, a total of
1548 control  subjects  from  both series were eventually  included  in the study. All
control  subjects  were  interviewed  in  the  hospital  by  use  of  the  same  question-
naire as used for the case patients; every case-control  triplet was interviewed by
the same specially trained interviewer. Earlier reports (2223)  have presented ad-
ditional  details  concerning  study  design,  data  collection,  comparability  of  the
control series, and analysis with respect to macronutrients and alcohol intake.

The  interview  covered  demographic  and  reproductive  information  and  also
included a validated, semiquantitative  food-frequency  questionnaire  (24). Based
on  an  analysis  using  a series of  twelve  24-hour  diet  recalls  as the  standard,  the
correlation  coefficients  for  data  derived  from  the  food-frequency  questionnaire
were  around  .40  for  most  macronutrients  and  food  groups,  including  monoun-
saturated fat and total fruits  and vegetables (24). All subjects in the present study
were asked to indicate the average frequency  of consumption, during a period of
1 year before  onset of the present disease or before  the interview  for visitor con-
trol  subjects, of  115 food  items  or  beverage categories  per month,  per  week, or
per day. For analysis, the frequency  of consumption  of different  food  items was
quantified  approximately  in  terms  of  the  number  of  times  per  month  the  food
was consumed  (25). Thus, daily  consumption  was multiplied  by  30 and  weekly
consumption  by 4, while a value of 0 was assigned  to food  items rarely or never
consumed.

Food  items  were  considered  in  groups  as  recommended  by  Davidson  and
Passmore  (26)  and  used  by  Manousos  et  al.  (27)  and  Trichopoulos  et  al.  (28).
The  individual  values for  monthly  consumption  were added, and the sums were
approximately  distributed  into  quintiles  based  on  the  distribution  of  the  entire
study population.  (For starchy  roots, i.e., potatoes, the distribution  was extreme-
ly skewed, making quintile distribution  impractical and even quartile distribution
suboptimal.)  Hsieh et al. (29) have shown that  there  is virtually  no difference  in
statistical  efficiency  if quantiles  are  based  on case  patients, control  subjects,  or
both groups combined; however, calculation of quantiles using the entire popula-
tion  (case  patients  and  control  subjects)  respects  the  usual  tenet  of  statistical
analysis that  the null  hypothesis  is presumed  true until  there  is evidence  against
it.  The  food  groups  formed  were  as  follows:  cereals;  starchy  roots  (i.e.,
potatoes);  sugars  and  syrups;  pulses, nuts, and  seeds; vegetables;  fruits;  meats,
fish, and eggs; milk and milk products; oils and fats; and nonalcoholic  beverages
(Table  1). Some  cooked  meals  were  allocated  to  two  food  groups  (one  half  in

each);  e.g.,  moussaka  was apportioned  into both  vegetables  and  the group  con-
taining  meats,  fish,  and  eggs,  and  cheese  pie  was  apportioned  into  cereals  and
milk  products  (Table  1). A number of  important  items, notably olive oil, butter,
margarine, and seed oils, were also considered  individually.

The  data  were  modeled  through  unconditional  logistic regression  (30) using
the  SPSS  statistical  package  (Statistical  Package  for  Social  Sciences, Chicago,
111.). The  effects  of  several  established  demographic  and  reproductive  risk  fac-
tors for  breast cancer were evident  in the present  study  (22). Thus, a core model
was used that included age (years), place of birth (urban or rural), Quetelet  index
(kg/m2),  parity  (parous  or  nulliparous),  age  at  first  pregnancy  (years,  among
parous  women),  age  at  menarche  (years),  and  menopausal  status  (postmeno-
pausal  or  premenopausal).  Exogenous  estrogens  are  used  very  infrequently  in
Greece;  thus, exposure  to oral  contraceptives  and/or  menopausal  estrogens  was
not  included  in the core model. Since intake of most food  items and food  groups
is positively correlated  with total energy  intake, caloric adjustment  also was util-
ized  (5,6,822).  The  statistical  significance  of  the  linear  trend  in  quantiles  of
consumption  of a food group was tested by dividing the regression coefficient  by

its standard  error to generate  an X  statistic (50). In addition,  the likelihood  ratio
test, which is the difference  of the maximized  log-likelihood  statistics, was used
to assess the  statistical  significance  of  additional  covariates  in a model  (28 JO).
Because odds ratios (ORs) for  reproductive  variables, macronutrients, and etha-
nol  intake were very  similar  when  cases  were compared  with either of the con-
trol  series  (2223),  all  results  presented  in  this  article  were  derived  from
comparisons  between  the  cases  and  the  combined  control  series.  All  P  values
reported in this article are two-tailed.

Results

Table  2  shows  the  distribution  of  case  patients  and  control
subjects by frequency  of consumption of each major food group.
The  X  values  for  log-linear  trend,  after  adjustment  for  age, are
also  given. These  data  are  not  directly  interpretable  because  of
confounding  by  demographic  and  reproductive  breast  cancer

that fruits  and vegetables were both inversely  and  independently
associated with breast cancer risk.

in 

We then  added  to the model that  included  the core  variables,
energy  intake, fruits, and vegetables  the other eight food  groups
that,  individually  taken,  were  not  significantly  associated  with
breast  cancer  risk  (Table  3).  This  procedure  allowed  us  to
evaluate  whether these eight  food  groups collectively  were con-
founding  the previously demonstrated  associations for consump-
tion  of  fruits  and  of  vegetables.  The  difference 
the
log-likelihood  was  13.9, which, with 8 degrees of freedom,  does
not represent  a statistically  significant  reduction. The  regression
coefficients  for  either  fruits  (b = —.08, corresponding  to an  8%
risk reduction per quintile increase) or vegetables (Jb -  -.13, cor-
responding  to  a  12%  risk  reduction  per  quintile  increase)
remained  virtually  unchanged. Furthermore, the addition  of any
one  of  the  eight  food  groups  did  not  lead  to  a  statistically  sig-
nificant  reduction  in deviance. Introduction  of total ethanol con-
sumption  in  the  model  also  had  no discernible  effect  (data  not
shown);  although  most  women  in  the  study  occasionally  con-
sumed alcoholic beverages, only  12% drank more than one glass
of  alcohol  per day (25). Moreover, alternative and  simultaneous
inclusion  of  olive  oil,  butter,  margarine,  and  seed  oils  did  not
appreciably  alter  the  regression  coefficients  for  either  fruits  or
vegetables.  We  conclude  that  the  inverse  associations  for  con-
sumption  of  fruits  and  vegetables  are  neither  mutually  con-
founded  nor confounded  by the collective  influence  of the other
eight food groups or by intake of various types of  fat.

Table  5  presents  the  frequency  distribution  of  case  patients
and  control  subjects  by  reported  consumption  of  the  main
specific  types  of  oils  and  fats  represented  in  the  Greek  diet.
Since  olive  oil  is  abundantly  consumed  in  Greece,  only  three
categories could be constructed: less than once per day, once per
day,  and  more  than  once  per  day.  In contrast,  for  consumption
of  butter,  margarine, and  seed  oils,  uniform  categorization  was
used.

Table 6 shows  logistic  regression-derived  coefficients  for  the
specific  oil or fat, controlling  for the core model  variables, total
energy intake, and consumption of fruits  and vegetables (but not
for  confounding  among  the  specific  oils  and  fats  themselves).
The  regression  coefficients  and ORs  are expressed  per  increase
of  one consumption  level  (increment  of  four  times  per  month),
except  for  olive  oil  where  two  indicator  variables  were  con-
structed. There was evidence that frequent  consumption  of olive
oil was associated  with reduced risk of breast cancer (OR = 0.75
[95%  confidence  interval  =  0.57-0.98]  for  more  than  once  per
day  versus  once  per  day),  whereas 
increasing  margarine
consumption  was  associated  with  increasing  risk  (OR  =  1.05
[95% confidence  interval  =  1.00-1.10] for  an  increment  of  four
times  per  month)  (Table  6).  Simultaneous  inclusion  of  all  four
specific  types  of  fat  into  the  model  did  not  reveal  appreciable
confounding  in  the  estimates  for  these  oils  and  fats.  Thus,  the
regression  coefficient  for  consumption  of  olive  oil  more  fre-
quently  than  once  per  day  changed  from  -.286  {P = .04)  to
-.274  (P  =  .05)  and  for  margarine  consumption  from  .046  to
.047  (P  = .05  in  both  instances).  Residual  confounding  of  the
apparent  effects  of  olive  oil  and  margarine  by  vegetables  or
fruits  is unlikely, since the nonparametric  correlation  coefficient

We  also  tried  to  assess  whether  any  of  the  associations
reported  above  were more  striking  in  premenopausai  women  or
in postmenopausal  women.  Among the study  subjects,  270 case
patients  and  505 control  subjects  were premenopausal,  whereas
550  case  patients  and  1041  control  subjects  were  postmeno-
pausal. No statistically  significant  effect  modification  of the risk
of breast cancer by menopausal  status was noted  with respect to
fruits,  vegetables, or types  of  fat:  P values  for  interaction  in all
instances  were  >.10,  although  the  protective  effect  of  olive  oil
consumption  was  apparently  concentrated  among  postmeno-
pausal women (P = .10).

Discussion

This  analysis  is  based  on  data  from  one  of  the  largest  case-
control  studies  that  have  examined  the  role  of diet  in  the  etiol-
ogy  of  breast  cancer.  The  high  rates  of  response  among  case

patients  and  control  subjects  alike  indicate  that  overt  selection
bias has not occurred. Moreover, the OR estimates for the estab-
lished  breast  cancer  risk  factors  as  well  as  for  macronutrients
(22) and  ethanol  intake  (23)  were  similar  with  the  use of  either
control  series.  The  interviewers  were  unblinded  as  to  the
subject's  case  or  control  status,  but  the  dietary  questionnaire
responses  were precoded,  requiring  little, if any, probing  by the
interviewer.  Moreover, an hypothesis  linking types of fat,  rather
than  total  fat,  to breast  cancer  has  not  been  widely  entertained.
There  was  no evidence  in  terms  of  weight  loss  or  otherwise  to
suggest  that  women  in the study  groups changed  their diet sub-
sequent  to  their  diseases. The  results  were  essentially  identical
when  women  with  fractures  [43% of  the hospital  controls (22)]
were excluded  to control  for  a possible  association  between os-
teoporosis and diet among the orthopedic patients.

Adjustment  for  energy  intake  controls  for  systematic  over-
reporting  of  cases  (7), unless  there  is selective  systematic  over-
reporting  or  underreporting  with  respect  to  particular  foods  or
food  groups;  however,  the  latter situation  seems  unlikely,  since
olive  oil, margarine, fruits,  or  vegetables  are  not  generally  per-
ceived by the public as having a role in breast cancer. Fruits and
vegetables  have  low  nutrient  densities,  and  control  for  energy
intake  may  be  less  efficient  for  these  groups  than  for  energy-
dense food  groups (31). However, there was no evidence of un-
derreporting  by case patients  in this study, and overreporting by
women  with  breast  cancer  could  have  only  attenuated  a
genuinely  stronger, inverse association  between consumption of
vegetables  and  fruits  and  the  disease.  Recommendations  to
reduce total fat  intake in order to reduce  the incidence of breast
cancer have been made in Greece, but they have not emphasized
different  types  of  fat,  making  it  unlikely  that  there  would  be a
fat  type-specific  differential  recollection  by  case  patients  and
control  subjects.  Lastly,  adjustment  for  socioeconomic  and  re-
productive  risk  factors  as  well  as  for  intercorrelations  among
food  groups  controls  for  the  mutual  confounding  effects  of  the
study  variables,  although  in  any  case-control  study,  concerns

about  residual  confounding  and  unidentifiable  selection  bias
cannot be eliminated.

The  biologic  plausibility  of  a protective  effect  of  vegetables
and  fruits  against  breast  cancer  is  strong;  Steinmetz  and  Potter
(13)  examined  more  than  a  dozen  categories  of  substances  in
vegetables  and  fruits  that  may  inhibit  the  process  of  carcino-
genesis  at  various  stages. The  epidemiologic  evidence  also ap-
pears supportive (3,4 J2),  although earlier  studies (33-35) either
were  small  or  did  not  use  a  dietary  questionnaire  sufficiently
comprehensive  to  allow  control  for  energy  intake  and  mutual
dietary  confounding.  Other  studies  (9,11,3640) 
that  have  ad-
justed  for  energy  intake  have  reported  inverse  associations  be-
tween  consumption  of  vegetables  and  fruits  and  breast  cancer
risk, although the authors of these studies have invoked  different
physiologic  processes  and  effector  compounds  to  explain  the
empirical associations.

The different  effects  of fat  types on the promotion  of chemi-
cally  induced  mammary cancer have been  studied  mostly  in ex-
perimental  animals, particularly  in female  Sprague-Dawley  rats
(2,20,21).  The  experimental  evidence  appears  to  suggest  that a
minimum  of essential  fatty  acids  (about 4% of energy  intake as
linoleic  acid)  is required  before  saturated  fat  can display  its  full
promoting  potential  at 20% of  total energy  intake. It  is interest-
ing  that,  in  these  studies  (2,18,20,21,41),  olive  oil  either  was a
poor promoter or had a protective  effect.

The epidemiologic  data with respect to olive oil  consumption
and  breast  cancer  appear  compatible  with  the  animal  evidence.
Ecologic  analyses  do  not  suggest  a  positive  correlation  with
breast  cancer  incidence  or  mortality  for  olive  oil  consumption
(42),  as  they  seem  to  do for  consumption  of  saturated  fat  (14).
Indeed,  Greek  women  with  42%  of  energy  intake  from  fat,
mostly from  olive oil (43,44), have substantially  lower mortality
from  breast cancer  than  U.S. women  whose energy  intake  from
fat 
is  at  present  around  35%  (45).  Results  of  analytic
epidemiologic  studies  are  relevant,  in  this  context,  only  if  they
refer  to olive oil per se or to monounsaturated  fat  in populations
who consume  large amounts of olive oil. Studies examining  the
association  of  monounsaturated  fat  consumption  with  breast
cancer  in  the  United  States  (10),  Finland  (46),  and  China  (47)
may  be  perfectly  valid,  but  they  do  not  address  the  olive  oil
issue. (In the United States, most monounsaturated  fat  is derived
from  meat.)  Studies  in Italy, Spain, and Greece are better suited
to  examine  the  role  of  olive  oil,  since  it  is  in  these  countries,
together  with  Libya,  that  olive  oil  is  consumed  in  substantial
quantities, particularly  among  the less Westernized  segments of
the population (21,43).

To  our  knowledge,  two  case-control  studies,  one  in  Spain
(48)  and  the  other  in  Italy  (49),  as  well  as  the  present  Greek
study  are  the  only  ones  that  meet  the  criteria  of  examining  the
role of olive oil per se in olive oil-consuming countries, of being
reasonably  large, and of being  analyzed  with  procedures  allow-
ing  control  for  energy  intake  and  mutual  confounding  among
food  groups. The Spanish  study  (48) and  the  Greek  study  have
generated  very  similar  results, suggesting  a protective  effect  of
olive  oil; the  Italian  study  (49)  found  a strong  positive  associa-
tion  between  saturated  fat  intake  and  breast  cancer  risk, but  no
association  with  respect to monounsaturated  fat  intake. The im-
portance  of  adjustment  for  energy  intake cannot  be  overempha-

sized.  In a study  in  France  (50), a positive,  but  not  statistically
significant,  association  was  found  between  breast  cancer  and
consumption of olive oil. However, in that study, total food  con-
sumption  was  positively,  significantly,  and  strongly  related  to
breast  cancer  risk,  indicating  that general  overreporting  by  case
patients was a distinct possibility.

Previous studies have not systematically examined  the role of
margarine  consumption  in  the  etiology  of  breast  cancer.  How-
ever, five case-control  studies  (51-55) that  were  identified  in a
literature  search  as  having  considered  margarine  consumption
all  reported  positive  associations,  although  these  associations
were  not  always  statistically  significant  and  were  not  always
substantiated  by  optimal  procedures.  It  would  be  premature  to
speculate  in  biologic  terms  what  role  margarine  consumption
could play  in the etiology of breast cancer. It is possible that the
positive  association  observed  in this  study  is  due  to  chance  or
mirrors  the  inverse association  noted  for  olive  oil  intake.  Alter-
natively,  margarine  may  have  distinct  biologic  properties  that
have not been  fully  characterized  in experimental  research. The
priority  at  this  stage  is  to  attempt  to  replicate  this  finding  in a
different  population.

There  is  some  evidence  that  premenopausal  and  postmeno-
pausal  women  may  have  breast  cancers  of  different  etiojogic
components  (56),  and  indeed  the  international  variation  in  the
incidence of this disease  is larger among  postmenopausal  wom-
en  (57). Several  studies (58-60) have focused  on the role of diet
in  the  occurrence  of  breast  cancer  among  postmenopausal
women,  although  the  data  remain  inconclusive.  In  the  present
study, there  was no suggestion  of an  interaction  between  meno-
pausal  status  and  consumption  of  vegetables,  fruits,  or  mar-
garine  in  relation  to  breast  cancer  risk.  However,  the  apparent
protective  effect  of  olive  oil  consumption  was  concentrated
among  postmenopausal  women,  although  the  interaction  term
was not statistically  significant  (P = .10). In the absence  of an a
priori  hypothesis  focusing  on  postmenopausal  women,  it  would
not  be  prudent  at  this  time  to  interpret  this  apparent  effect
modification  in biologic terms.

We conclude  that consumption  of  vegetables  and  fruits  is in-
versely, significantly,  and strongly associated  with breast cancer
risk  and  that  olive  oil  consumption  may  also  reduce  this  risk,
whereas  margarine  intake  appears  to  be  associated  with  an
elevated risk for the disease.
