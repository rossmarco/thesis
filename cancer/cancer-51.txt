ABSTRACT Estrogen is a major factor in the development of breast cancer. In situ estrogen production by
aromatase/estrogen synthetase in breast cancer plays a dominant role in tumor proliferation. Because natural
compounds such as ﬂavones and isoﬂavones have been shown to be inhibitors of aromatase, it is thought that
vegetables that contain these phytochemicals can inhibit aromatase activity and suppress breast cancer cell
proliferation. Heat-stable extracts were prepared from vegetables and screened for their ability to inhibit aromatase
activity in a human placental microsome assay. The white button mushroom (species Agaricus bisporus) sup-
pressed aromatase activity dose dependently. Enzyme kinetics demonstrated mixed inhibition, suggesting the
presence of multiple inhibitors or more than one inhibitory mechanism. “In cell” aromatase activity and cell
proliferation were measured using MCF-7aro, an aromatase-transfected breast cancer cell line. Phytochemicals in
the mushroom aqueous extract inhibited aromatase activity and proliferation of MCF-7aro cells. These results
suggest that diets high in mushrooms may modulate the aromatase activity and function in chemoprevention in
postmenopausal women by reducing the in situ production of estrogen.

KEY WORDS:

● breast cancer ● aromatase ● white button mushrooms ● diet and cancer prevention

Breast cancer is the most common cancer affecting women.
Despite earlier detection and improved adjuvant therapies, the
breast cancer incidence was 109.7 cases per 100,000 women
and the death rate was 25.6 per 100,000 women between 1990
and 1997 (1). Emerging evidence suggests that in situ estrogen
production in the breast of postmenopausal women may play
an important biological role in carcinogenesis (2–7). Aro-
matase, a cytochrome P450 enzyme complex, converts andro-
gens to estrogens. Aromatase expression occurs in breast tu-
mors (2,6) and may play a more dominant role in tumor
proliferation than circulating estradiol (8 –10).

A major effort to reduce breast cancer mortality and mor-
bidity is focused on developing better breast cancer prevention
strategies. Hormonal blockade with tamoxifen has reduced the
incidence of invasive and noninvasive breast cancer in high
risk women (11). An alternative drug-based strategy for hor-
monal modulation is the inhibition of aromatase (12). Aro-
matase inhibitors reduce serum estradiol levels in healthy
female volunteers and in animal studies (13–16).

Although pharmaceutical agents have therapeutic and pre-
ventative roles in breast cancer, the use of foods and dietary
compounds to prevent breast cancer is currently being ex-
plored. A variety of complementary substances including plant

extracts, fruits and vegetables, vitamins, minerals and minor
dietary constituents are undergoing vigorous evaluation as
promising sources of anticancer agents (17). Plants contain a
variety of compounds that block the formation of carcinogens,
alter membrane structure, suppress DNA synthesis, enhance
cell differentiation and compete with estrogen for estrogen
receptors (18). Cohort and case-controlled epidemiologic
studies have investigated the effect of certain vegetables and
fruits on the incidence of cancer (18 –20). The contribution of
fruits and vegetables in relative risk reduction of breast cancer
is conﬂicting and it is difﬁcult to draw absolute conclusions
from the current data. A recent meta-analysis did suggest an
inverse relationship between intake of fruits and vegetables
with the relative risk of developing breast cancer (21). This
association was greater for vegetables than for fruits. There is
compelling epidemiologic data in Asian women who have a
four- to sixfold lower risk of breast cancer than Western
women (22). One of the reported differences between these
two populations is the consumption of soy protein (23). A
possible mechanism-based explanation for the lower incidence
of breast cancer is that soy is high in phytoestrogens (24),
phytochemicals that suppress aromatase (25–31).

Our laboratory has been interested in the interaction of
ﬂavone and isoﬂavone phytoestrogens with human aromatase
and the inhibitory capacity of various compounds (32,33). In
the quest for novel compounds, we reported promising data on
the effect of grape juice on aromatase inhibition and in vivo
suppression of breast cancer cell growth in a nude mouse tumor
model (34). These exciting ﬁndings have encouraged us to
screen a variety of vegetables using aromatase inhibition as the
mechanism to identify vegetables that could be a potential

dietary source for novel aromatase inhibitors. The current
study identiﬁed the edible mushroom, Agaricus bisporus, as a
potent inhibitor of aromatase.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Materials. Androstenedione, testosterone and 4-hydroxy andro-
stenedione (4-OHA)5 were obtained from Sigma (St. Louis, MO).
[1␤-3H]androstenedione ([1␤-3H]A) was purchased from NEN Du-
pont (Boston, MA). Heat-stable extracts from green onion, celery,
carrot, bell pepper, broccoli, spinach and mushroom were prepared by
boiling in water (70 g wet matter/200 mL H2O) and centrifuging at
35,000 ⫻ g for 30 min. The supernatant was Millipore (0.45 ␮m;
Bedford, MA) ﬁltered, concentrated in a Speed-VAC centrifuge and
reconstituted in H2O at 7.5X concentration (7.5XH2O). Heat was
used to break up the compartmentalization that exists in biological
materials (35).

For the kinetic analysis, cell culture studies, step gradient separa-
tions and HPLC analysis, stock preparation of the mushroom extract
was prepared from fresh, washed white button mushrooms (Agaricus
bisporus). The lyophilized heat-stable white button mushroom extract
was reconstituted as a 10X stock concentrate in water (10XH2O) or
culture medium (10XCM) as indicated below for individual studies.
Aromatase inhibition studies were performed using human pla-
cental microsome preparations, which contain a high level of aro-
matase. Microsomes were prepared from human placenta as previ-
ously described (36,37). The MCF-7 cell line, a human estrogen
receptor positive (ER⫹) adenocarcinoma, was obtained from ATCC
(Manassas, VA). MCF-7 cells transfected with human aromatase
(MCF-7aro) were generated by stable transfection of MCF-7 cells
with the human placenta aromatase cDNA under the control of the
␤-actin promoter (38).

Placental microsome assay. Aromatase converts androgens to
estrogens through three hydroxylations (39). The third hydroxy-
lation is thought to involve position C1 of androgens, which leads
to aromatization of the A ring of the steroids. The aromatase assay
was performed in the following manner. The substrate, androst-4-
ene-3, 17-dione [1␤-3H(N)] (speciﬁc activity 37 MBq/mol) was
dissolved in serum-free cell culture medium, millipore ﬁltered and
added to the assay mixture. The assay mixture (500 ␮L) consisted
of 20 ␮g placental microsomes, 100 nmol/L [3H]-androstenedione,
10 ␮mol/L progesterone, 1 g/L bovine serum albumin and 67
mmol/L potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4 (34). After a 10-min
preincubation at 22°C, 12 mmol/L NADPH (50 ␮L) was intro-
duced and the reaction was continued at 37°C for an additional 20
min in the pilot vegetable and mushroom screening experiments.
The incubation time was reduced to 10 min for all of the exper-
iments with the white button mushroom. The enzymatic activity
was terminated with 5% trichloroacetic acid. One molecule of
[3H]-H2O is formed when one molecule of androstenedione is
converted to estrone. The supernatant containing the aromatase
product, [3H]-H2O, was extracted with chloroform and with dex-
tran-treated charcoal. The suspension was centrifuged (700 ⫻ g for
10 min) and an aliquot of the supernatant was counted for radio-
[3H]-H2O
activity. Aromatase activity was calculated as pmol
formed/(mg protein 䡠 h). Analyses were performed in triplicate and
the data are expressed as the mean ⫾ SD. The [3H]-H2O release
assay was veriﬁed in our laboratory by the product extraction assay
(38).

Kinetic determinations. The inhibition kinetic studies were
performed using unfractionated white button mushroom extract. The
concentration range of [1␤-3H]A ranged from 10 to 200 nmol/L. The
rate of the reaction was previously established in our laboratory to be
linear under these conditions (31–33,40,41). Analyses were per-
formed in triplicate and the data are expressed as the mean ⫾ SD.

Aromatase “in cell” activity in MCF7aro cells. MCF7aro cells
are androgen-responsive through aromatase-dependent conversion of
testosterone to estrogen. MCF7aro cells (2 ⫻ 105 cell/well) were
cultured in 6-well plates in Eagles’s minimum essential medium
(MEM) with Earle’s salts (Irvine Scientiﬁc, Santa Ana, CA) with 1
mmol/L pyruvate, 2 mmol/L glutamine (Irvine Scientiﬁc) and 10%
heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (⌬FCS) (Omega Scientiﬁc, Tarzana,
CA) overnight. The following day the medium was changed to
phenol red minus MEM (␾⫺MEM) (Irvine Scientiﬁc) with 10%
charcoal dextran–treated heat-inactivated serum (cd⌬FCS) for 24 h.
The medium was removed and fresh cd⌬FCS medium containing the
additives was introduced. Cells were cultured in cd⌬FCS (5 mL/well)
alone (control), with 2.5, 5 or 10 ␮L of 10X mushroom extract
reconstituted in culture medium (10XCM)/mL cd⌬FCS or 4-OHA
(100 ␮mol/L) as a control inhibitor. After the cells were cultured for
48 h, the medium was removed and the cells were washed twice with
5 mL PBS. The “in cell” aromatase assay was performed with [1␤-
3H]A in ␾⫺MEM without calf serum for 1 h as described (42). The
supernatant was removed and extracted as previously described (42)
with 1 mL chloroform to remove unreacted [1␤-3H]A. The aqueous
layer containing the aromatase product, [3H]-H2O, was extracted
with dextran-treated charcoal. An aliquot of the supernatant was
taken for radioactive determination. The cells were solubilized with 1
mL of 0.5 mol/L NaOH. Protein concentration was determined by
the Bradford assay (43). Aromatase activity was expressed as pmol
[3H]-H2O produced/(mg protein䡠h). Analyses were performed in trip-
licate and the data are expressed as the mean ⫾ SD.

Cell proliferation in the presence or absence of white button
mushroom extract. MCF7aro cells were cultured in 6-well plates
under the conditions described above for the “in cell” aromatase assay
with or without mushroom extract for 48 h. Cells were washed twice
with 5 mL PBS and solubilized with 1 mL of 0.5 mol/L NaOH.
Cellular proliferation was determined by quantiﬁcation of protein
synthesis by the Bradford assay (43). The data are reported as mean
mg protein/L ⫾ SD. The use of protein measurements for aromatase-
mediated cell proliferation studies was previously conﬁrmed by cell
count analyses (42).

Fractionation of mushroom extract. Mushroom extract (5 mL of
10XH2O) was fractionated using a Sep-Pak C18 solid phase cartridge
(Waters, Milford, MA) by sequential elution with a step gradient
solvent system ranging from 5 to 90% acetonitrile/H20. Fractions
were lyophilized and reconstituted in 500 ␮L water for fractions
between 5 and 60% acetonitrile or in 10% dimethyl sulfoxide:H2O
for the fractions collected from 70 to 100% acetonitrile/H20. Solvent
controls were assayed. Incremental fractions were assayed for inhibi-
tion of aromatase in the placental microsome assay as described above
for a 10-min incubation time. Dose-response quantiﬁcation was per-
formed using three volumes (10, 25 and 50 ␮L) in triplicate.

Statistical analysis. The data were analyzed by ANOVA or
student’s t test for the “in cell” aromatase activity and for total protein
in the presence or absence of testosterone. Differences were consid-
ered signiﬁcant when P ⬍ 0.05.

RESULTS

Inhibition of aromatase by vegetable extracts. Recent
data from our laboratory demonstrated that phytochemicals in
grape juice could suppress aromatase activity (34). No data are
available on the effect of speciﬁc vegetables on aromatase
activity. Seven common vegetables were selected to test the
hypothesis that vegetables may contain inhibitors of aromatase
activity. The aqueous extraction method for natural com-
pounds has been described (35). This method was selected to
avoid toxic solvents that would require removal before use in
subsequent “in cell” assays. To enhance the recovery of natural
compounds from biological materials, heat was used to break
up the compartmentalization found in these materials (35). In
addition, heat inactivates plant enzymes that could potentially
interfere with the aromatase enzyme assay. Preparations of
heat-stable compounds are also valuable for later biological
applications in animal and human trials in which sterility is

essential. Of the seven vegetable extracts tested, the extract
from white button mushroom (Agaricus bisporus) was the most
effective in inhibiting human placental aromatase (Fig. 1). A
50% inhibition of aromatase activity was achieved with 50 ␮L
of 7.5XH2O mushroom extract. The active component in the
mushroom extract appeared to be water soluble and heat
stable. Of the other extracts evaluated, celery had a modest
inhibitory effect. Extracts prepared from green onion, carrot,
bell pepper, broccoli and spinach did not inhibit aromatase
under these experimental conditions.

stufﬁng (Agaricus bisporus),

Aromatase inhibition by extracts from different varieties of
mushrooms. To determine whether aromatase inhibition was
unique to the white button mushroom, ten additional varieties
of mushrooms were evaluated, i.e., woodear (Auricularia spp.),
crimini (Agaricus bisporus), white button mushroom (Agaricus
bisporus), oyster (Pleurotus ostreatus), Italian brown (Pleurotus
spp.), enoki (Flammulina velutipes), baby button mushrooms
(Agaricus bisporus),
shiitake
(Lentinula edodes), chanterelle (Cantharellus spp.) and porto-
bello (Agaricus bisporus) (Fig. 2). The studies identiﬁed that
the stufﬁng mushroom had the most potent inhibitory effect
against aromatase activity. The shiitake, white button mush-
room, portabello, crimini and baby button mushrooms also
demonstrated signiﬁcant antiaromatase effects. These ﬁndings
suggest that a number of varieties of mushroom possess inhib-
itory effects on aromatase activity in an in vitro assay. All
subsequent studies were performed using heat-stable extracts
from the white button mushroom.

Aromatase inhibition kinetic analysis with white button
mushroom extract. The double reciprocal plot of aromatase
inhibition with respect to androstenedione by white button
mushroom extract is shown in Figure 3. The mixed-type
inhibition kinetic proﬁle for the whole-mushroom extract
suggested the presence of one or more inhibitors in the extract
and/or more than one inhibitory mechanism.

extraction cartridges (Fig. 4). Dose-response experiments were
performed using the human placental microsome assay. The
maximum inhibition was identiﬁed in the 15% elution frac-
tion. These results indicate the presence of more than one
antiaromatase chemical in the white button mushroom ex-
tract. Scale-up isolation, puriﬁcation and structural character-
ization of these antiaromatase chemicals are currently under-
way in our laboratory.

“In cell” aromatase assay. The “in cell” aromatase assay
was performed to determine the feasibility of introducing the
extract in a whole-cell system. The dose-response effect of
white button mushroom extract on “in cell” aromatase activity
was determined in MCF7aro cells cultured in the presence or
absence of testosterone (Fig. 5). The cells were cultured with-
out mushroom extract or in the presence of increasing con-
centrations of mushroom extract. The aromatase inhibitor,
4-OHA, was used as the known inhibitor for a positive inhib-
itory control. Mushroom extract inhibited aromatase activity
in a dose-dependent manner with all three concentrations of
white button mushroom extract evaluated. In the presence of
testosterone, an aromatase substrate, the basal aromatase ac-
tivity was increased. This testosterone-dependent increase in
aromatase activity remained in the presence of the lowest
concentration (2.5 ␮L) of mushroom extract. When the
mushroom extract concentration was increased, there was a
proportional decrease in the testosterone-dependent aro-
matase activity with the intermediate dose of mushroom ex-
tract (5 ␮L). In the presence of the highest concentration of
mushroom extract (10 ␮L), the aromatase activity was inhib-

Aromatase “in cell” assay in MCF7 cells transfected

in the presence of white button

The dose-response effect of mushroom extract on “in cell” aromatase
activity was evaluated in MCF7aro cells (2 ⫻ 105 cells/well) cultured in
six-well plates with and without 1 nmol/L testosterone. The cells were
cultured without mushroom extract or with 2.5, 5 or 10 ␮L lyophilized
mushroom extract reconstituted in culture medium (10XCM)/mL of cell
culture medium (5 mL/well). The aromatase inhibitor, 4-hydroxyandro-
stenedione (4-OHA), was used as the inhibitor control. The assay was
done in triplicate and the results are expressed as mean ⫾ SD. Aro-
matase activity differed among groups for cells grown in the absence (P
⬍0.001) and in the presence (P ⬍0.001) of testosterone. The vehicle
control without testosterone differed from the testosterone control (P

were treated with mushroom extract at 5 ␮L with and without testos-
terone tended to differ (P ⫽ 0.06).

enzyme. These cells are ER⫹ and demonstrate increased cell
proliferation in the presence of testosterone. Cell proliferation
was determined by measuring total cellular protein in the
presence or absence of the mushroom extract as has been
previously described (42). The dose-response effect of mush-
room extract on total protein expression in MCF7aro cells
cultured in the presence or absence of testosterone is shown in
Figure 6. The aromatase inhibitor, 4-OHA, was used as the
known inhibitor. Cells grown in the presence of testosterone
demonstrated increased proliferation. This is the expected
response in MCF7aro cells that are transfected with aromatase
and are ER⫹. Exposure to low doses of mushroom extract did
not decrease the total amount of protein below the control
conditions at 48 h. The highest dose of mushroom extract,
however, decreased the advantage gained by the addition of
testosterone to a level similar to that seen with 4-OHA. These
ﬁndings suggest that the inhibitory effect of white button
mushroom extract is through a speciﬁc antiaromatase action,
not a cytotoxic effect.

DISCUSSION

In the search for new approaches to breast cancer chemo-
prevention, known pharmaceutical agents have been tested for
their potential beneﬁcial effects. Chemoprevention aims to

seasons. Furthermore, the white button mushroom is less costly
than other varieties of mushrooms, making it more readily
purchased by the average consumer.

MCF7aro cells are estrogen dependent for growth. Trans-
fection with human aromatase provides them with the ability
to synthesize estrogens and leads to enhanced growth. Deter-
mination of the effect of white button mushroom extract on
cellular proliferation has revealed that the heat-stable extract
suppresses only the androgen-induced cellular proliferation as
determined by total cell protein. The total protein determina-
tion in cells without androgen did not demonstrate a decrease
at the three doses of mushroom extract evaluation, indicating
that the extract was not toxic. The use of protein measure-
ments for aromatase-mediated cell proliferation studies has
been previously conﬁrmed by cell count analyses (42).

Mushrooms have been recognized for their edible and func-
tional properties for centuries (47). Edible mushrooms have
beneﬁcial effects on health and in the treatment of disease
through their immunomodulatory, antineoplastic and lipid-
reducing properties (47). The shiitake mushroom has served as
the model for investigating functional mushrooms and isolat-
ing pure compounds for pharmaceutical use. Water extracts of
the shiitake mushroom prevent tumor growth in mice (48).
We have demonstrated that a water-soluble extract from the
white button mushroom can suppress aromatase activity.

The data from our study suggest that the white button
mushroom may have potential therapeutic beneﬁt as a func-
tional food by reducing the activity of aromatase, the putative
enzyme for converting androgens to estrogens. These studies
have been performed using the crude extract to avoid potential
changes in efﬁcacy by the puriﬁcation process and to maintain
a close resemblance to the composition as a food source. The
whole extract demonstrates efﬁcacy in an “in cell” assay system
producing aromatase inhibition without toxic side effects. The
limitation of this approach is that this extract contains a
spectrum of compounds that are further metabolized and may
produce potent intermediary molecules that participate in
alternative mechanisms.

Future work will focus on isolation, puriﬁcation and char-
acterization of the components. Animal studies using time-
course and dose-response data are being designed to test the
whole extract and compare it to the most potent puriﬁed
components. Speciﬁc site-directed mutants of the aromatase
binding pocket will serve to characterize the binding charac-
teristics of the puriﬁed components and compare the inhibi-
tory activity and binding capacity of the mushroom extract
with known aromatase inhibitors (31,32,41,49,50). The white
button mushroom demonstrates the ability to inhibit aro-
matase activity in vitro and in a cell culture system, but like
other mushroom varieties, it may contain a number of other
bioactive compounds with diverse biological activity. The
puriﬁed compound(s) may be very different from the whole
mushroom in their inhibitory activity on aromatase. The in-
evitable questions that follow are whether eating the whole
mushroom has preventative or therapeutic value, and if so,
how much mushroom should be consumed to achieve a ben-
eﬁcial effect. Future studies should answer some of these ques-
tions and provide guidelines for incorporation of mushrooms
and/or their extracts into the diet for their “nutraceutical”
properties.

The dose response effect of mushroom extract on total protein expres-
sion was determined in MCF7aro cells (2 ⫻ 105 cells/well) cultured in
six-well plates with and without testosterone. Cells were cultured and
protein determined as described in Materials and Methods. 4-Hy-
droxyandrostenedione (4-OHA) was used as the aromatase inhibitor
control. The experiments were performed in triplicate and the results
are expressed as mean ⫾ SD. Total protein levels differed among
groups of cells grown in the presence of testosterone (P ⬍0.001). Total

modulate speciﬁc steps in the neoplastic process including
prevention of DNA damage by free radicals, inhibition of
cellular proliferation and promotion of cellular differentiation
(44). A major strategy for breast cancer chemoprevention is
directed at abolishing the estrogen effects. The in situ reduc-
tion of estradiol synthesis by inhibition of aromatase could
reduce estrogen-dependent cellular proliferation and estrogen
conversion to genotoxic metabolites (12).

The present study was undertaken to screen and evaluate a
number of vegetables as potential natural sources of aromatase
inhibitors. Heat-stable, water-soluble extracts were prepared.
A recent study reported that serum concentrations of ␣-caro-
tene and lutein were higher when raw vegetable juice was
consumed than when raw vegetables or cooked vegetables
were consumed (45). The current approach was undertaken to
maximize extraction of small molecules but avoid toxic sol-
vents (35). Using an in vitro human placental microsome
aromatase assay, the white button mushroom was found to be
a potent inhibitor of aromatase. The assay of aromatase activ-
ity in human placental microsomes in the presence of a variety
of compounds is an established model to measure relative
inhibitory effects of a series of chemopreventive compounds
(46). We further conﬁrmed the biological activity of white
button mushroom in an aromatase-transfected breast cancer
cell line to conﬁrm the inhibitory effect in an “in cell” model.
The white button, shiitake, portabello, crimini and baby but-
ton mushroom varieties demonstrated the ability to inhibit
aromatase activity in an in vitro assay. The work presented
here focused on the white button mushroom because it dem-
onstrated potent inhibition and is easily available during all
