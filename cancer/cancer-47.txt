Abstract

Background: Chronic inﬂammation is one of the mechanisms involved in carcinogenesis. Diet is a major source of pro- and

anti-inﬂammatory compounds. The Dietary Inﬂammatory Index (DII) was designed to estimate its overall inﬂammatory potential.

Objective: Our objective was to investigate the associations between the DII and overall, breast, and prostate cancer

risks.
Methods: This prospective study included 6542 participants [3771 women and 2771 men with a mean 6 SD age of 49.2 6
6.4 y and a BMI (in kg/m2) of 24.0 6 3.6 at baseline] from the Suppl ´ementation en VItamines et Min ´eraux AntioXydants

(SU.VI.MAX) cohort who completed at least six 24-h dietary records during the ﬁrst 2 y of follow-up. The DII was based on

36 food variables. Higher scores corresponded to more proinﬂammatory diets. A total of 559 incident cancers were

diagnosed (median follow-up, 12.6 y), including 158 female breast and 123 prostate cancers (the 2 main cancer sites in this

cohort). Associations were characterized by multivariable Cox proportional hazards models. Stratiﬁed analyses were

performed according to the median of usual daily alcohol intake.

Results: Sex-speciﬁc quartiles of the DII were positively associated with prostate cancer risk [quartile (Q) 4 compared with

Q1, HR: 2.08; 95% CI: 1.06, 4.09] but not with overall or breast cancer risks. There was an interaction between the DII and
alcohol intake (grams per day) on overall cancer risk (P-interaction = 0.02): the DII was positively associated with overall
cancer risk in low-to-moderate alcohol drinkers (Q4 compared with Q1 HR: 1.75; 95% CI: 1.15, 2.68; P-trend = 0.02),
whereas no association was detected in higher consumers of alcohol (P-trend = 0.8). This interaction was also observed
for breast cancer (P-interaction = 0.001).

Conclusion: Consistent with mechanistic data, ﬁndings from this study indicated that proinﬂammatory diets are

associated with increased prostate cancer risk and, in low-to-moderate alcohol drinkers, with increased overall and breast
cancer risk. The SU.VI.MAX trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00272428. J Nutr 2016;146:785–91.

Introduction

The involvement of chronic inﬂammation in carcinogenesis is
increasingly acknowledged.
In many experimental studies,
inﬂammatory mechanisms involving inﬂammatory cells and
signaling pathways also have been described as promoting
carcinogenesis (1). Moreover, as reported by 2 meta-analyses (2,
3), epidemiologic studies have shown associations between
inﬂammatory biomarkers such as C-reactive protein (CRP)10
and IL-6 and an increased risk of overall and lung cancer. A

previous prospective study nested in the Suppl´ementation en
VItamines et Min´eraux AntioXydants (SU.VI.MAX) cohort
found that baseline high-sensitivity CRP was associated with an
increased overall cancer and prostate cancer risk (4).

A growing body of literature has investigated the inﬂuence of
diet on chronic inﬂammation (5–8). Indeed, diet is a major
source of bioactive compounds for which either pro- or anti-
inﬂammatory properties have been identiﬁed (9). The Dietary
Inﬂammatory Index (DII) is a literature-derived scoring system

that was developed to estimate the pro- and anti-inﬂammatory
potential of the overall diet and to investigate its possible
relations with chronic diseases (9).

Globally, cancer is one of the leading causes of death, with
about one-third of cancers attributed to unhealthy lifestyle and
dietary behaviors,
i.e., modiﬁable risk factors (10). To our
knowledge, few studies have investigated the pro- or anti-
inﬂammatory potential of the diet, measured with the DII, in
relation to cancer risk (11–23). Moreover, only 4 of these studies
were based on a prospective design and focused on colorectal
cancer (16, 18, 19) or lung cancer (14). The associations
between DII and female breast cancer (13) or prostate cancer
(12, 17) have only been explored in nonprospective case-control
studies.

Therefore, our objective was to investigate the relations
between the DII and overall, female breast, and prostate cancer
risks in a large French prospective cohort.

Methods

Study population. The SU.VI.MAX study is a population-based
double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial (NCT00272428)
initially designed to assess the effect of a daily antioxidant supplemen-
tation on coronary heart disease and cancer incidence. All participants
took a single daily capsule containing a combination of 120 mg of
ascorbic acid, 30 mg of vitamin E, 6 mg of b-carotene, 100 mg of
selenium, and 20 mg of zinc, or a placebo (24). Participants were advised
against taking any self-prescribed supplements during the trial. The
study was conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki guidelines
and was approved by the Ethics Committee for Studies with Human
Subjects at the Paris-Cochin Hospital (CCPPRB No. 706) and the
Commission Nationale de lÕInformatique et des Libert´es (French
National Commission for Computed Data and Individual Freedom)
(CNIL No. 334641). During the ﬁrst-year study, 13,017 subjects were
enrolled (1994–1995) and health events monitoring was pursued until
September 2007. Written informed consent was obtained from all
participants.

Baseline data collection. At enrollment, all participants completed
questionnaires on sociodemographics, smoking status, physical activity,
and medication use. They also underwent a clinical examination and
anthropometric measurements by study nurses and physicians. Age at
menopause (natural or artiﬁcial) was self-reported by women during
follow-up.

Dietary data were collected with the use of the Minitel Telematic
Network (an Internet prototype), which was widely used in France as an
adjunct to the telephone at the beginning of the study. During the trial

phase, participants were invited to provide a 24-h dietary record every
2 mo (randomly distributed over weekend and week days). In order to
comply with the prospective design, dietary records from the ﬁrst 2 y of
follow-up were used in the present study. The participants selected the
foods consumed at breakfast, lunch, dinner, and/or any other occasion
throughout the day from a predeﬁned list of ;1000 items. Portion sizes
were estimated with the use of a validated picture booklet distributed at
enrollment (25). Energy, alcohol (grams per day), and nutrient intake
was estimated with the use of a published French food composition table
(26).

DII computation. The computation of the DII was previously described
in detail (9). Steps involved in the DII calculation can be found in
Supplemental Figure 1. Brieﬂy, the DII is a score initially designed with
45 dietary variables determined from a literature review of 1943 articles
published up to 2010. A literature-derived inﬂammatory effect score was
assigned to every micronutrient, macronutrient, or food variable
associated with an increase (+1), a decrease (21), or no effect (0) on 6
major inﬂammatory biomarkers, including IL-1b, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-a,
and CRP.

Mean intake of every food variable was transformed with standard-
ized values from a world database into a z score, then converted to a
percentile and centered. Finally, the centered percentile score for each
food variable was multiplied by its associated coefﬁcient, then these were
summed across the 45 dietary variables, thus providing an individual DII
score. In the present study, the DII was based on 36 dietary variables
available in the database. Total intake of energy, protein, carbohydrate,
total fat, SFAs, cholesterol, vitamin B-12, and iron were computed into
the score as proinﬂammatory factors, whereas dietary intake of MUFAs,
PUFAs, n–3 FAs, n–6 FAs, alcohol, ﬁber, magnesium, niacin, thiamin,
riboﬂavin, vitamin B-6, vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin D, vitamin E, folic
acid, b-carotene, anthocyanidins, ﬂavan-3-ol, ﬂavonols, ﬂavanones,
ﬂavones, isoﬂavones, garlic, ginger, pepper, onions, and tea were entered
as anti-inﬂammatory factors. Theoretical DII scores ranged from 28.9
(maximally anti-inﬂammatory diet) to +8.0 (maximally proinﬂamma-
tory diet). Higher DII scores indicated a more proinﬂammatory diet.

Case ascertainment. Major health events were self-reported by subjects
during follow-up (between inclusion in 1994 and September 2007).
Investigations allowed collection of medical case data from participants
themselves, physicians, and/or hospitals. An independent expert com-
mittee of physicians reviewed the medical information. Cases were
validated through a pathologic report and classiﬁed with the use of the
International Classiﬁcation of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modiﬁ-
cation (27). All ﬁrst-incident primary cancers were considered as cases in
this study, except for basal cell carcinoma (not considered to be cancer).

Statistical analysis. Of the 13,017 participants of the SU.VI.MAX
study, 161 were excluded because of a cancer diagnosis reported before
the start of the follow-up. Of the remaining participants, 6542 provided
$6 valid 24-h dietary records within the ﬁrst 2 y of follow-up, and thus
were available for analysis. For all covariates, <5% of values were
missing and were replaced by the respective mode value.

Baseline characteristics of participants were compared between cases
and noncases with the use of x2 tests or StudentÕs t tests, as appropriate.
HRs and 95% CIs obtained from Cox proportional hazards models
with age as the primary time variable were used to characterize the
association between sex-speciﬁc quartiles of the DII and overall, female
breast, and prostate cancer risk. Participants contributed person-time
until the date of diagnosis of the studied cancer, the date of the last
completed questionnaire, the date of death, or 30 September 2007,
whichever occurred ﬁrst. Participants who reported a cancer other than
the one studied during the follow-up were included and censored at the
date of that diagnosis (except for basal cell carcinoma, which was not
considered to be cancer). We conﬁrmed that the assumptions of
proportionality were satisﬁed through examination of the log–log

(survival) compared with log–time plots. The SAS macro %RCS_Reg
(28) was used to test for a possible threshold effect and to select the most
appropriate cutoff.

Multivariable models were adjusted for age (time-scale in the Cox
model), sex, intervention group of the initial SU.VI.MAX trial (antiox-
idant or placebo), number of dietary records (continuous), BMI (in kg/
m2) (<25, $25 to <30, or $30), height (continuous), physical activity
(irregular, <1 h/d, or $1 h walking or equivalent/d), smoking status
(never, former, or current), educational level (primary, secondary, or
university), family history of cancer in ﬁrst-degree relatives (yes or no),
daily mean energy intake without alcohol
(kilocalories per day;
continuous), and daily mean alcohol intake (grams per day; continuous).
For breast cancer analyses, additional adjustments were performed for
menopausal status at baseline (yes or no), use of hormonal treatment for
menopause at baseline (yes or no), number of live births (continuous),
and family history of breast cancer in ﬁrst-degree relatives (yes or no).
For prostate cancer analyses, additional adjustments were applied for
prostate-speciﬁc antigen concentration at baseline (continuous) and
family history of prostate cancer in ﬁrst-degree relatives (yes or no).

Because alcohol intake is an important risk factor for several cancer
sites (29) and is considered to be an anti-inﬂammatory factor in
formulating the DII (9), we tested the interaction between alcohol intake
(sex-speciﬁc population median) and DII (sex-speciﬁc quartiles). Anal-
yses were conducted overall and then stratiﬁed by alcohol intake. Two-
factor interactions were also tested between the DII and the intervention
group of the initial SU.VI.MAX trial, BMI, and sex.

Models also were computed separately for premenopausal and
postmenopausal breast cancer (women contributed to the premeno-
pausal model until their age of menopause, or from their age of
menopause, respectively). Sensitivity analyses were carried out while
excluding cancer cases diagnosed during the ﬁrst year of follow-up. All
tests were 2-sided, and P < 0.05 was considered to be statistically
signiﬁcant. SAS software version 9.3 was used for analyses.

The interaction between sex-speciﬁc quartiles of the DII and
alcohol intake (sex-speciﬁc median, i.e., 6.6 g/d for women and
24.1 g/d for men) on overall cancer risk was statistically
signiﬁcant (P-interaction = 0.02) (Table 3). In stratiﬁed analyses,
the DII was positively associated with overall cancer risk in low-
to-moderate alcohol consumers (Q4 compared with Q1 HR:
1.75; 95% CI: 1.15, 2.68; P-trend = 0.02), but not in higher
consumers of alcohol (P-trend = 0.8). This interaction was also
observed for breast cancer (P-interaction = 0.001): DII was
positively associated with breast cancer risk in low-to-moderate
alcohol consumers (Q4 compared with Q1 HR: 3.82; 95% CI:
1.51, 9.64; P-trend = 0.002). An inverse association was detected
in higher consumers of alcohol (Q4 compared with Q1 HR: 0.31;
95% CI: 0.15, 0.65; P-trend = 0.005). The P-interaction between
the DII and alcohol intake was 0.8 for prostate cancer.

The interaction test between sex-speciﬁc quartiles of the DII
and the antioxidant supplementation group from the initial
SU.VI.MAX trial was not statistically signiﬁcant (P-interaction =
0.9 for overall cancer, P-interaction = 0.4 for breast cancer, and
P-interaction = 0.4 for prostate cancer). DII scores ranked from
25.0 to 5.8 in the antioxidant supplementation arm (mean 6
SD: 0.7 6 1.8) and from 25.1 to 6.0 in the placebo arm (mean 6
SD: 0.7 6 1.9). No interaction was observed between the DII
and sex (P-interaction = 0.3 for overall cancer) or BMI (P-
interaction = 0.4 for overall cancer, P-interaction = 0.1 for breast
cancer, and P-interaction = 0.6 for prostate cancer). Exclusion of
in situ cancer cases (n = 47) or exclusion of cancer cases
diagnosed during the ﬁrst year of follow-up (n = 11) provided
similar ﬁndings (data not shown). Breast cancer results were
similar in pre- and postmenopausal women (data not shown).

Results
Median follow-up was 12.6 y. DII scores ranked from 25.1 to
6.0 for women (mean 6 SD: 1.0 6 1.8) and 25.0 to 5.3 for men
(mean 6 SD: 0.3 6 1.8). A total of 5.2% of the subjects were lost
to follow-up. During follow-up, a total of 559 incident cancers
(512 invasive and 47 in situ) were diagnosed, including 158
female breast, 123 prostate, and 278 other cancers (including 51
skin, 32 colorectal, 19 thyroid, 15 lung, and 161 other cancers).
Regarding female breast cancer cases, 59% were estrogen
receptor–positive and 43% were progesterone receptor–positive.
Among prostate cancer cases, 5% had a Gleason score between
2 and 4, 87% between 5 and 7, and 8% between 8 and 10. Study
population characteristics are described in Table 1. Compared
with those without cancer, those with cancer (overall) were older
and taller; were more frequently male; had a slightly higher
number of children, higher alcohol intake, and a higher baseline
plasma prostate-speciﬁc antigen concentration (in men); and had
more family members with a history of cancer.

The associations between sex-speciﬁc quartiles of the DII and
risk of overall, female breast, prostate, and nonbreast/
nonprostate cancers are represented in Table 2. Higher sex-
speciﬁc quartiles of the DII were positively associated with
prostate cancer risk [quartile (Q) 4 compared with Q1 HR: 2.08;
95% CI: 1.06, 4.09]. The observed results suggested a possible
threshold effect, conﬁrmed in a dose–response analysis with the
use of restricted cubic splines (see Supplemental Figure 2). A
cutoff of 21.0 was selected. An increased risk of prostate cancer
was observed for a DII value greater than or equal to 21.0
compared with a DII less than 21.0 (HR: 2.31; 95% CI: 1.35,
3.95; P = 0.002). No signiﬁcant relation was found regarding
overall, female breast, and nonbreast/nonprostate cancer risks.

Discussion

In this prospective study, a proinﬂammatory diet corresponding
to higher DII scores was associated with an increased prostate
cancer risk. In addition, when analyses were stratiﬁed by alcohol
intake, which is a major risk factor for several cancer sites, the
DII also was associated with increased overall and breast cancer
risk in low-to-moderate drinkers of alcohol. These results
support a role of inﬂammation in mechanisms underlying
established nutrition–cancer relations (29).

To our knowledge, few studies have explored the relations
between the DII and cancer risk. Most of them were non-
prospective case-control studies: 1 showed positive associations
of the DII with pancreatic cancer (15); 2 with prostate cancer, in
line with our results (12, 17); 2 with colorectal cancer (20, 21);
and 2 with esophageal cancer (11, 22). A recent case-control
study in postmenopausal women observed no association
between the DII and breast cancer (13). Only 4 prospective
studies investigated the relations between the DII and cancer
risk: 1 found a direct association with lung cancer risk (14), and
3 found a direct association with colorectal cancer risk (16, 18,
20). All of these studies used an FFQ (11–19, 21, 22) or a dietary
history questionnaire (20), but none used repeated 24-h records
or recalls. To our knowledge, no prospective study has previ-
ously investigated the relation between the DII and overall,
female breast, and prostate cancer risks.

Our analysis resulted in a positive association between the
proinﬂammatory potential of the individual diets assessed with
higher DII scores and increased prostate and,
in low-to-
moderate alcohol drinkers, overall and breast cancer risks.
These associations were statistically signiﬁcant from the Q2 of
the DII compared with Q1, suggesting a threshold effect. These

results are consistent with epidemiologic studies that demon-
strated 1) correlations between the DII and inﬂammatory
biomarkers, and 2) associations between these inﬂammatory
biomarkers and cancer risk. Indeed, the DII has been signif-
icantly and positively associated with several
inﬂammatory
biomarkers, such as IL-6 and CRP (5, 7, 30, 31). Moreover, in a
meta-analysis published in 2013, Guo et al. (3) concluded that
elevated concentrations of CRP were associated with an
increased risk of all cancers, lung cancer, and possibly breast,
prostate, and colorectal cancer. Since then, several prospective
studies corroborated these ﬁndings. We previously showed that
baseline high-sensitivity CRP concentrations were positively
associated with subsequent overall and prostate cancer risk in
the SU.VI.MAX cohort (4). In a nested case-control study from
the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition
cohort, colorectal cancer cases were characterized by a ‘‘reactive
oxygen metabolites and CRP’’ pattern (32), and several inﬂam-
matory biomarkers were associated with elevated endometrial

cancer risk in postmenopausal women (33). Zuo et al. (34) found
that plasma neopterin, kynurenine-to-tryptophan ratio, and CRP
were interrelated and positively associated with overall cancer
risk. Shiels et al. (35) observed a positive association between
inﬂammatory markers and lung cancer risk. However, this point
remains debated because recent studies also reported no associ-
ation between CRP and/or IL-6 and prostate (36) and epithelial
ovarian cancer risk (37).

Experimental evidence strongly supports the involvement of
inﬂammation in carcinogenesis (1, 38–40). Reactive oxygen and
nitrogen intermediates, prostaglandins, and inﬂammatory cyto-
kines were found to be associated with chronic inﬂammation
(39). These molecules are involved in neoplastic tumor processes
through immune responses (1). Genetic polymorphisms in
inﬂammation-related genes [IL1B, IL10, tumor necrosis factor
(TNF), IL6, IL8, and cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2)] and inﬂam-
matory molecules expressed may be implicated in prostate
cancer initiation and progression (38).

Based on the results of numerous experimental and observa-
tional studies (9), alcohol intake contributes to the DII compu-
tation as an anti-inﬂammatory marker. Nevertheless, alcohol
is acknowledged to be a major risk factor in many cancers and
to be involved in several procarcinogenic mechanisms (DNA
damage, generation of reactive oxygen species,
increase in
circulating estrogens, etc.) (29, 41). For these reasons, we tested
the interaction between the DII and alcohol intake, which was
statistically signiﬁcant for overall and breast cancer risk. Thus,
we stratiﬁed our analysis by the sex-speciﬁc median of daily
alcohol intake. A higher DII was associated with increased
overall and breast cancer risk in low-to-moderate drinkers only.
Several hypotheses can be formulated to explain these results.
First, the pro- or anti-inﬂammatory potential of the diet may
inﬂuence cancer risk in low-to-moderate drinkers while being
exceeded by the deleterious effect of alcohol in heavier drinkers.
Second, because of the DII design, higher alcohol intake makes
DII scores lower and may scramble the results because alcohol
simultaneously increases cancer risk. This also may explain the
inverse association between the DII and breast cancer risk

observed in higher alcohol drinkers, which is unlikely to be
causal. Indeed, although analyses were adjusted for alcohol
intake, it may be difﬁcult to disentangle the effect of alcohol. In
addition, in the SU.VI.MAX cohort, we previously showed an
interaction between several classes of polyphenols and alcohol
intake on breast cancer risk (42). Although an inverse associ-
ation was observed between polyphenols and breast cancer risk
in women with an alcohol intake below the median, a direct
association was observed with higher consumption of alcohol.
Because several classes of polyphenols are included in the DII
calculation as anti-inﬂammatory factors,
this adds further
complexity to the association between the DII, alcohol, and
breast cancer risk.

Strengths of our study included its prospective design with
long follow-up and the implementation of a literature-derived
index to assess the overall inﬂammatory potential of the diet. In
addition, usual dietary intake was assessed with a high degree of
accuracy by using repeated 24-h dietary records (with a mean
of 10 records/subject) that accounted for intraindividual day-
to-day and seasonal variability. Nevertheless, some limitations
should be acknowledged. First, the limited number of cases
may have impaired our ability to detect some of the hypothesized
associations. Moreover, speciﬁc cancer sites other than the 2

primarily represented in the cohort (i.e., breast and prostate)
could not be investigated separately. Second, subjects were
volunteers involved in a long-term nutrition study and thus were
more highly educated, less likely to smoke, and more health-
conscious than the general French population. Despite this
healthier proﬁle (low baseline risk), the number of incident
cancers was larger than in the general population. The study
protocol included a yearly check-up that may have encour-
aged early diagnosis (in particular for breast cancer in
women, for whom screening mammograms were performed
during follow-up). Therefore, caution is needed when extrap-
olating these results to the entire French population. Third, all
self-reported cases were validated by an expert committee.
However, it is possible that some individuals with cancer
did not report their cancer events. Next, although most of
the 45 DII variables were taken into account (n = 36), some
items (n = 9) were missing in our database and thus could
not be included, such as caffeine, eugenol, saffron, selenium,
turmeric, zinc,
thyme or oregano, and rosemary (anti-
inﬂammatory factors), and trans FAs (proinﬂammatory fac-
tor). However,
it is unlikely that these missing variables
drastically inﬂuenced the results, because it has been shown
that the ability of the DII to predict inﬂammation remained
the same when the number of food variables was decreased
from 45 to 28 (5). Finally, residual confounders could not be
ruled out. However, a large range of confounding factors was
taken into account, thus limiting potential bias.

To our knowledge, this study was the ﬁrst to investigate the
prospective association between the overall pro- or anti-
inﬂammatory potential of the diet, assessed with the DII, and
overall, female breast, and prostate cancer risk. Consistent with
mechanistic data, our results suggest that a proinﬂammatory
diet may be associated with increased prostate cancer risk. When
models were stratiﬁed by alcohol intake, a major cancer risk
factor, a proinﬂammatory diet also was associated with in-
creased overall and breast cancer risk in low-to-moderate
drinkers. These results provide interesting insights for the
understanding of the relations between diet and cancer risk,
and inﬂammation-based underlying mechanisms. They suggest
that promoting an anti-inﬂammatory dietary pattern may
contribute to cancer prevention.
