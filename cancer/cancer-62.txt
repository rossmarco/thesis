Abstract

Background: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States, with a 5-y
survival rate of ;65%. Therefore, the identiﬁcation of modiﬁable health factors to improve CRC survival is crucial.

Objective: We investigated the association of 4 prediagnostic a priori diet quality indexes with CRC-speciﬁc and all-cause

mortality in the Multiethnic Cohort (MEC).

Methods: The MEC included >215,000 African-American, Native Hawaiian, Japanese-American, Latino, and white adults

living in Hawaii and California who completed a validated quantitative food-frequency questionnaire in 1993–1996. CRC

cases and deaths were identiﬁed through linkages to cancer registries and to state and national vital registries. Sex-

speciﬁc HRs and 95% CIs were estimated for the Healthy Eating Index (HEI) 2010, the Alternative HEI (AHEI) 2010, the

alternate Mediterranean Diet (aMED) score, and the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) index with

CRC-speciﬁc and overall mortality as the primary outcomes. Ethnicity-speciﬁc analyses were the secondary outcomes.

Results: Among 4204 MEC participants diagnosed with invasive CRC through 2010, 1976 all-cause and 1095 CRC-speciﬁc

deaths were identiﬁed. A higher aMED score was associated with lower CRC-speciﬁc mortality in women [HR continuous

pattern score divided by its respective SD (HR1SD): 0.86; 95% CI: 0.77, 0.96] but not in men (HR1SD: 1.01; 95% CI: 0.92,
1.11). A higher aMED score was also associated with lower all-cause mortality in women (HR1SD: 0.88; 95% CI: 0.81, 0.96)
but not in men (HR1SD: 1.00; 95% CI: 0.93, 1.07). The HEI-2010, AHEI-2010, and DASH index were not signiﬁcantly
associated with CRC-speciﬁc or with all-cause mortality. The inverse relation for the aMED score was limited to African

Americans and to colon (compared with rectal) cancer.

Conclusions: The aMED score was related to lower mortality only in African-American women (1 of 5 ethnic groups

studied). The results should be interpreted with caution due to the small numbers of cases within ethnic groups and the
issue of multiple testing. J Nutr 2016;146:1746–55.

Introduction

Colorectal cancer (CRC)8 is the fourth most commonly diag-
nosed malignancy and the second leading cause of cancer-related
death in the United States, with a 5-y survival rate of ;65% (1).
Understanding the impact of modiﬁable health behaviors, such

as physical activity and optimal nutrition (2), on prognosis is
therefore critical. In recent years, dietary patterns have been
promoted as a way to better capture the complexity of dietary
intake than single foods or nutrients (3). A priori indexes

evaluate dietary quality on the basis of dietary recommendations
and existing scientiﬁc evidence, whereas a posteriori–derived
dietary patterns are identiﬁed through exploratory data-driven
approaches (3). Studies investigating diet quality and CRC
etiology reported that higher scores on the Healthy Eating Index
(HEI) and the Alternative HEI (AHEI), as well as certain a
posteriori patterns, were associated with a lower risk of developing
CRC (4, 5). The few studies that investigated dietary indexes in
relation to CRC survival are contradictory. One US study reported
lower CRC-speciﬁc mortality among rectal cancer cases with higher
prediagnostic HEI-2005 scores but not among colon cancer cases
(6). In a European cohort, greater prediagnostic concordance with
the World Cancer Research Fund guidelines was associated with a
lower CRC-speciﬁc mortality (7). Although higher postdiagnostic
AHEI-2010 scores predicted lower all-cause mortality in 1201
women with CRC (8), the AHEI-2010, the alternate Mediterranean
Diet (aMED) score, the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension
(DASH) index, and a posteriori Western and prudent patterns were
not signiﬁcantly related to CRC-speciﬁc mortality. In contrast, a
posteriori patterns rich in meat as well as higher meat consumption
predicted a poorer CRC prognosis and all-cause mortality in several
analyses (9–12).

Poor prediagnostic diet quality is linked to a suboptimal
micronutrient status that is likely to become even worse after
diagnosis (e.g., due to adverse effects from treatment). Certain
micronutrients have an impact on oxidative stress (13) and cell
differentiation (14), both predictors of CRC risk and progres-
sion. Micronutrient status may therefore be a potential under-
lying biological mechanism of the association of dietary patterns
with survival. Recent studies also point toward a role of the
human gut microbiome composition as a potential mediator of
diet and CRC development and progression (15, 16). Most of
the published studies were conducted in relatively homoge-
nous populations composed of non-Hispanic whites. Given that
Japanese Americans and African Americans are at a higher risk
to develop CRC than whites (17) and that African Americans
experience higher CRC mortality (1), research in ethnically
diverse populations is of great interest. We therefore investi-
gated the association of 4 prediagnostic a priori indexes—the
HEI-2010 (18), the AHEI-2010 (19), the aMED score (20), and
the DASH index (21)—with all-cause and CRC-speciﬁc mor-
tality among white, African-American, Japanese-American,
Native Hawaiian, and Latino participants with CRC in the
Multiethnic Cohort (MEC).

Methods

Study population. The MEC is an ethnically diverse prospective cohort
designed to investigate the association of lifestyle and genetic factors
with the incidence of cancer. The design and implementation of the MEC
have been described elsewhere (22). Brieﬂy, >215,000 men and women
aged 45–75 y at recruitment, and residing in Hawaii or California
(primarily Los Angeles County), were enrolled in the cohort between
1993 and 1996. To obtain a multiethnic sample of whites, African
Americans, Native Hawaiians, Japanese Americans, and Latinos, a
population-based sampling frame used drivers’ license ﬁles, supplemented
with voter registration lists and Health Care Financing Administration

(Medicare) ﬁles. The institutional review boards at the University of
Hawaii and the University of Southern California approved the study
protocol.

Incident colon and rectal cancer cases were identiﬁed through regular
linkages to the Los Angeles County Cancer Surveillance Program, the
State of California Cancer Registry, and the statewide Hawaii Tumor
Registry, all members of the National Cancer InstituteÕs Surveillance,
Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program. Dates and causes of
death were identiﬁed by routine linkages with California and Hawaii
vital records and the National Death Index databases. Information on
incident cases and/or death ascertainment was available up to 31
December 2010. Among eligible participants of the 5 major ethnic
groups who had not developed colon or rectal cancer before cohort
entry, 4832 newly diagnosed invasive CRC cases were identiﬁed through
2010. After exclusions [272, not adenocarcinoma; 179, invalid diet; 1,
did not survive after diagnosis; 69, missing BMI at cohort entry; and 166,
with BMI (in kg/m2) <18.5, with some overlap], 4204 cohort members
diagnosed with invasive CRC during follow-up were included in the
current analysis.

Data collection. At cohort entry, participants completed a self-
administered, 26-page questionnaire [questionnaire at cohort entry
(Qx1)] that collected self-reported demographic characteristics, height
and body weight, medical history, family history of colon and rectal
cancer, physical activity, and a diet history by using a quantitative FFQ
(QFFQ). The QFFQ asked participants to report their average frequency
of consumption and serving sizes for >180 food items during the past
year. A calibration study indicated acceptable correlations between the
QFFQ and 24-h recalls for all sex and ethnic groups (23). Between 1999
and 2002, ;85% of eligible MEC members completed a brief follow-up
questionnaire [questionnaire 2 (Qx2)] providing updated information on
self-reported body weight. In 2003–2008, a subset of MEC participants
responded to a follow-up questionnaire [questionnaire 3 (Qx3)] that
included a full QFFQ. Information on stage at diagnosis and ﬁrst course
of treatment but not recurrence was available from the SEER registries in
Hawaii and Los Angeles.

Dietary indexes. Dietary indexes were a priori deﬁned and based on
work conducted by the Dietary Patterns Methods Project (24–26).
Scoring was based on food groups from the MyPyramid Equivalents
Database. The portion sizes were converted to cup and ounce equivalents
as required for MyPyramid Equivalents Databases. The 4 indexes, as
described in detail previously (26), use different scoring systems and
focus on diverse aspects of the diet, although they share an emphasis on
several major food groups (Supplemental Table 1). The HEI-2010
includes 12 components (total fruit, whole fruit, total vegetables, dark
green vegetables and legumes, whole grains, dairy, total protein foods,
seafood and plant proteins, ratio of PUFAs and MUFAs to SFAs, reﬁned
grains, sodium, and empty calories) and reﬂects the 2010 Dietary
Guidelines for Americans, with higher scores reﬂecting better adherence
to federal dietary guidelines (18). The AHEI-2010 includes 11 foods and
nutrients [total vegetables excluding potatoes, whole fruit, whole grains,
sugar-sweetened beverages and fruit juice, nuts, soy and legumes, trans
FAs, long-chain (n–3) FAs (EPA + DHA), PUFAs, sodium, alcohol, and
red and processed meat] predictive of chronic diseases such as type 2
diabetes or cardiovascular disease (19).

The aMED score, as developed by Fung et al. (20), includes 9
components (total vegetables excluding potatoes, total fruit, nuts,
legumes, ﬁsh, whole grains, MUFA to SFA ratio, alcohol, and red and
processed meat) and was an adaptation of the Mediterranean Diet Score
developed by Trichopoulou et al. (27) that takes into account scientiﬁc
literature on diet and chronic disease risk. The DASH index as outlined
by Fung et al. (21) includes 8 components (total vegetables excluding
potatoes; total fruit; nuts, seeds, and legumes; low-fat dairy; whole
grains; sodium; sugar-sweetened beverages and fruit juices; and red and
processed meat) that are emphasized in the DASH diet designed for
hypertension management.

All 4204 CRC cases in this study had information on dietary patterns
derived from the questionnaire at cohort study (Qx1; 1993–1996). Of
these, 35.8% completed Qx3; 953 participants did so after their CRC

diagnosis (with 77 CRC-speciﬁc and 212 all-cause deaths) and 552 CRC
cases before their CRC diagnosis (with 97 CRC-speciﬁc and 151 all-
cause deaths). Given the low number of CRC cases with information on
postdiagnostic diet, we used prediagnostic dietary index scores derived
from Qx1 for the current analysis. Nevertheless, correlations between
prediagnostic (Qx1) and postdiagnostic (Qx3) dietary index scores
indicated acceptable consistency with the following correlation coefﬁ-
cients: HEI-2010 = 0.50, AHEI = 0.52, aMED = 0.46, and DASH = 0.55
(all P < 0.0001). The mean differences between pre- and postdiagnostic
dietary index score points indicated a slight improvement of the
HEI-2010 score after diagnosis (HEI-2010: 4.3 score points) and no
substantial changes in the AHEI-2010, aMED, and DASH scores
(AHEI-2010: 1.3 score points; aMED: 20.21 score points; and DASH:
20.22 score points).

Statistical analysis. To evaluate the association of dietary indexes with
all-cause and CRC-speciﬁc death, we computed multivariable-adjusted
HRs and 95% CIs with the use of Cox proportional hazards models of
mortality separately for men and women as our primary outcome. Given
sex differences in a previous study (10), we decided a priori to analyze
men and women separately. We formally tested the Schoenfeld residual
regression and found that the proportional hazards assumption of the
Cox model was fulﬁlled. Age was used as the time metric, beginning with
the age at CRC diagnosis and ending with the age at death or censoring
on 31 December 2010. For CRC-speciﬁc death, deaths due to other
causes were censored. The dietary index scores were divided into
quartiles on the basis of the baseline distribution of CRC cases. However,
due to the limited range in scores for the aMED and DASH the 4
categories may be slightly different. To evaluate possible dose-response
relations and to compare the regression parameters across indexes, trend
variables based on the ratio of each index value by its respective standard
deviation were tested. In addition, trend tests were performed across
index score quartiles while modeling the medians as continuous variable.
Self-reported hypertension, heart disease, and stroke from Qx1 were
used to create a variable for comorbidity (0, 1, or 2+). Various covariates
were included in the models as potential confounders based on previous
publications and on survival analyses within the MEC (28, 29). In the
minimally adjusted model, we included age at CRC diagnosis in 10-y age
groups, ethnicity, and SEER tumor stage (local, regional, distant, or
unknown). In the fully adjusted model, we additionally included
education, family history of CRC, BMI, smoking status and number of
pack-years, physical activity, total energy intake, comorbidity, SEER
tumor stage (local, regional, distant, or unknown), radiation and
chemotherapy treatment, and nonsteroidal anti-inﬂammatory drug
(NSAID) use. Physical activity was divided into <0.5 or $0.5 h/d spent
performing moderate or vigorous activities. Family history of colon or
rectal cancer included a self-report of the cancer in the participantÕs
natural father, mother, or full siblings. Education was coded as high
school or less, vocational school or some college, and undergraduate or
graduate degree. Cigarette smoking was classiﬁed as never, past, or
current and pack-years were also computed. On the basis of questions
about aspirin or other pain medication, excluding acetaminophen,
NSAID use was coded as ever ($2 times/wk for $1 mo) or never. BMI
based on self-reported height and weight measures was classiﬁed as
normal weight (18.5 to <25), overweight (25–29.9), or obese ($30). For
covariates with missing values (i.e., education, smoking status, physical
activity, NSAID use, tumor stage, and treatment variables), a missing
category was created. BMI was treated as a time-varying exposure by using
values from the questionnaire at cohort entry (Qx1) and Qx2, as
appropriate (30). BMI at Qx1 was modeled for risk sets before the age at
Qx2, and BMI at Qx2 was modeled for risk sets after the age at Qx2. To
exclude the possibility that a broad categorization of physical activity and
BMI introduced residual confounding, we re-conducted the main analysis
with physical activity and BMI as continuous variables. The results were
virtually unchanged (data not shown) as were the risk estimates when the
year of diagnosis was included to control for cohort effects in dietary
patterns and treatment regimens (data not shown).

We investigated the importance of individual score components
for the association of the dietary pattern scores with CRC-speciﬁc and
all-cause mortality separately for men and women by including all

individual components simultaneously in a model for each of the 4
indexes. For signiﬁcant components, we performed conﬁrmatory anal-
yses with the respective individual component only. We examined
potential interactions of dietary indexes with ethnicity by using a global
Wald test of the cross-product terms modeling dietary indexes as a
continuous variable.

In secondary analyses, we explored ethnicity-speciﬁc models and
performed analyses stratiﬁed by postmenopausal estrogen treatment,
which was categorized as never estrogen use compared with past/current
use as reported at cohort entry (Qx1). In addition, cancers of the colon
and the rectum were examined separately in relation to dietary indexes,
which were signiﬁcantly related with mortality in the main analysis.
Finally, we stratiﬁed the analysis by stage of disease at diagnosis.

For our main analyses, Bonferroni correction was used to adjust for
multiple comparison (8 tests: 4 dietary indexes 3 2 sexes) for each
hypothesis (CRC-speciﬁc mortality and all-cause mortality), and P-trend
< 0.0065 was deemed signiﬁcant. For all other analyses, signiﬁcance was
deﬁned as P < 0.05. All of the analyses were conducted in SAS version 9.3
(SAS Institute).

Results

Of the 4204 CRC cases (Table 1), 1441 were Japanese American,
842 African American, 840 white, 805 Latino, and 276 Native
Hawaiian. The mean 6 SD age at diagnosis was 71.4 6 8.7 y.
Cases were diagnosed between cohort entry (1993–1996) and
December 2010, and the mean follow-up time was 6.0 6 4.7 y.
The majority of cases were diagnosed at a localized (n = 1854) or
regional (n = 1605) stage compared with a distant (n = 647) or
unknown (n = 98) stage. The sample included 1645 men and
1580 women with colon cancer, 591 men and 354 women with
rectal cancer, and 22 men and 12 women with a mixed form
of cancer. The respective percentages of overweight and obese
participants at cohort entry were 40% and 22%, respectively.
Men and women in the highest dietary index quartile had
lower BMIs, were more likely to be never smokers, and reported
higher physical activity. The 4 indexes were strongly associated
with each other (Supplemental Table 2), with the highest cor-
relations between HEI-2010 and DASH scores and the lowest
between HEI-2010 and aMED scores.

In our primary analysis, the multivariable-adjusted model in
women but not in men (Tables 2 and 3), continuous aMED score
divided by its SD predicted a 14% lower CRC-speciﬁc mortality
[HR continuous pattern score divided by its respective SD
(HR1SD): 0.86; 95% CI: 0.77, 0.96]. The results for all-cause
mortality were similar and showed signiﬁcant associations only
for the aMED score in women (HR1SD: 0.88; 95% CI: 0.81,
0.96). The HRs for HEI-2010 indicated a weak inverse
association with disease-speciﬁc mortality in women that did
not reach signiﬁcance (HR1SD: 0.91; 95% CI: 0.83, 1.00),
whereas CRC-speciﬁc mortality was not associated with the
AHEI-2010 or the DASH index. HEI-2010, AHEI-2010, and
DASH scores were not related to all-cause mortality. In the
minimally adjusted model, none of the index scores was
signiﬁcantly related with CRC-speciﬁc mortality. The continu-
ous HEI-2010 was signiﬁcantly inversely related to all-cause
mortality in both sexes, and 1 SD of aMED score was signif-
icantly inversely associated with all-cause mortality in women.
After correcting for multiple testing with the Bonferroni
method, signiﬁcant trends were observed across aMED quar-
tiles in women for CRC-speciﬁc (P-trend = 0.004) and all-cause
(P-trend = 0.0008) mortality in the fully adjusted model and for
aMED score and all-cause mortality (P trend = 0.005) in women
in the minimally adjusted model. With regard to individual
components, the most prominent ﬁnding for the aMED score was

that fruit consumption was related to better CRC-speciﬁc and all-
cause mortality in women but not in men (data not shown).

In men, none of the interaction terms for any of the dietary in-
dexes with ethnicity were signiﬁcant for CRC-speciﬁc or all-cause
mortality. In women, the interaction terms for the HEI-2010,
the AHEI-2010, the aMED score, and the DASH index with eth-
nicity were signiﬁcant for CRC-speciﬁc mortality (P-interactions =
0.01, 0.02, 0.04, and 0.04, respectively) and the interaction terms
for the HEI-2010, the AHEI-2010, and the DASH index with
ethnicity were signiﬁcant for all-cause mortality (P-interactions =
0.002, 0.01, and 0.005, respectively).

In our secondary analysis, ethnicity-speciﬁc results (Figure 1)
indicated that African Americans experienced lower mortality
with higher scores for the HEI-2010, aMED, and DASH, but
the risk estimates with regard to CRC-speciﬁc mortality were
signiﬁcant only in women. Higher aMED scores predicted lower
all-cause mortality among African-American women, whereas
higher DASH scores were associated with lower all-cause mortal-
ity among African-American women and men. When women
were stratiﬁed by postmenopausal estrogen treatment at cohort
entry, all 4 index scores were signiﬁcantly related to a lower CRC-
speciﬁc mortality in past and current users, whereas no associa-
tions were observed in nonusers; the results for all-cause mortality
were weaker but also reached signiﬁcance in all index scores
except for the AHEI-2010 (Table 4).

Separate models for the aMED score by cancer site indicated a
lower CRC-speciﬁc (HR: 0.85; 95% CI: 0.75, 0.97) and all-cause
(HR: 0.86; 95% CI: 0.79, 0.95) mortality for colon but not for
rectal cancer in women (data not shown). Stratiﬁcation by stage of
disease at diagnosis showed a signiﬁcant inverse association of
higher aMED scores in women but not in men with distant disease;
the respective HRs for women per a 1-SD unit were 0.82 (95% CI:
0.68, 0.98) and 0.84 (95% CI: 0.71, 1.00) for CRC-speciﬁc and all-
cause mortality, respectively. No signiﬁcant associations were
detected for localized and regional disease (data not shown).

Discussion

In this large multiethnic cohort composed of 5 major ethnic
groups, the prediagnostic aMED score was associated with lower
CRC-speciﬁc mortality and all-cause mortality in all women
as a group but not in men. No signiﬁcant associations of the
HEI-2010, the AHEI-2010, or the DASH scores with CRC-
speciﬁc mortality or all-cause mortality were detected. A number
of secondary analyses showed signiﬁcant associations of the
HEI-2010, aMED, and DASH scores with lower CRC-speciﬁc
mortality in African-American women, inverse associations of
all 4 dietary indexes with mortality in estrogen users but not in
nonusers, and stronger inverse associations for advanced than
for localized stage of disease at diagnosis.

In the current analysis, higher aMED scores but none of the
other examined dietary indexes were related to a lower CRC-
speciﬁc and all-cause mortality in women. None of the dietary
indexes were related to all-cause or CRC-speciﬁc mortality in
men. Note that the dietary indexes investigated in this analysis
were not developed speciﬁcally for cancer survival but for other
chronic conditions such as hypertension. The high correlations
of the dietary indexes in this study suggest some level of
agreement. Still, the less than perfect correlations conﬁrm that
each index represents a unique combination of dietary compo-
nents. The aMED score differs in many important ways from the
other indexes (Supplemental Table 1). The scores are more
determined by foods than nutrients, only 9 components are
emphasized, vegetables exclude potatoes, and alcohol intake
is part of the score. Another distinct property is that the con-
sumption of nuts and legumes makes a stronger contribution
than to any other index. Each is counted separately as ‘‘1’’ whereas
they are scored together in the AHEI-2010 and the DASH index
and nuts are not present in the HEI-2010. Legumes include
soy beans, a source of isoﬂavones that might affect cancer initi-
ation and progression through estrogenic and antiestrogenic activ-
ities (31). Nuts are sources of bioactive compounds, including

1 HRs (95% CIs) for an increase of 1 SD in the HEI-2010, AHEI-2010, aMED, and
DASH scores were obtained by Cox regression and adjusted for age at diagnosis,
smoking status, pack-years, physical activity, total energy intake, education, stage at
diagnosis, radiation, chemotherapy, NSAID use, family history of CRC, and comorbid-
ities. Data were missing for n = 178 for estrogen use at cohort entry. AHEI, Alternative

high prediagnostic serum folate was associated with lower CRC-
speciﬁc and all-cause mortality (37), ﬂavonoid supplements reduced
CRC recurrence (38), and patients with CRC with high circulating
25-hydroxyvitamin D had a lower risk of CRC-speciﬁc and all-cause
mortality in a meta-analysis of cohort studies (39). As another
potential mediator, the composition of the human gut microbiome is
known to be inﬂuenced by diet (15) and might be linked to CRC
development and progression (16).

The Mediterranean Diet Score was previously inversely
related with CRC risk and all-cause cancer mortality in a meta-
analysis of cohort and case-control studies (40). However,
no associations of the postdiagnostic AHEI-2010, aMED, and
DASH scores with CRC-speciﬁc mortality were detected among
1201 women from the NursesÕ Health Study (NHS) diagnosed
with stage I–III CRC (8). The index versions were similar and
cannot explain the observed differences across studies, but the
NHS used postdiagnostic diet, whereas we used prediagnostic
diet due to the small sample size of MEC participants with
information on postdiagnostic diet. Because pre- and postdiagnos-
tic dietary index scores showed minimal differences and signiﬁcant
correlations, it appears that no major dietary changes occurred.

Signiﬁcant ﬁndings were mainly restricted to women in this
study. Sex differences were also reported in an a posteriori
pattern and with CRC-speciﬁc survival analysis: for instance, the
adverse inﬂuence of the processed-meat pattern on survival was
more pronounced among women than men (10). The results of
the stratiﬁed analysis by postmenopausal estrogen use might
partly explain the observed sex differences, because inverse
associations for all 4 dietary indexes were limited to current or
past postmenopausal estrogen users. These ﬁndings point toward a
synergistic effect of diet and estrogen use as also seen in research
from the WomenÕs Health Initiative Estrogen-plus-Progestin Study
in which women taking hormone therapy had a lower risk of CRC
than did women taking a placebo (41). Current postmenopausal
estrogen use before CRC diagnosis was also associated with
improved CRC-speciﬁc and all-cause survival in the NHS (42).
There are several mechanisms for hormone exposure to protect
against development and progression of colon cancer. For example,

phytoestrogens and MUFAs. Only the aMED score includes the
component the ratio of MUFAs to SFAs, which was related to
lower all-cause mortality in a meta-analysis of cohort studies (32).
In addition, dichotomous scoring in the aMED may lead to greater
contrasts and better discrimination of eating patterns within the
population and provide more power for detecting differences. It
should be noted that due to differences in the median intakes of
foods, aMED results from studies conducted in the United States
are likely to differ from those of European studies.

The single-component analyses from our study suggest that
consumption of fruit may be a crucial component to lower
mortality in women. As a potential biological mechanism, fruit
is rich in phytochemicals (e.g., carotenoids), which were related
to a lower mortality in patients with CRC in the MEC (33) but
showed mixed results in other studies (34, 35). With regard to
other speciﬁc micronutrients, prediagnostic plasma concentra-
tions of the biologically active form of vitamin B-6 were not
associated with CRC-speciﬁc or all-cause mortality (36), whereas

cell studies suggest that exogenous estrogens could lead to slower
disease progression (43, 44).

Signiﬁcant associations of the HEI-2010, aMED, and DASH
scores with a lower CRC-speciﬁc mortality were seen in African-
American women only. Considering that most dietary indexes
were originally created and tested among participants of
European and African-American (for DASH) heritage, food
preferences of Japanese Americans, Native Hawaiians, and
Latinos might not be as well represented in the indexes. This
may partly explain the lack of associations among these ethnic
groups but not among white participants. Our ﬁndings are of
particular relevance given that African Americans are more
likely to be diagnosed with CRC than whites and have lower
survival rates (1). To our knowledge, no study has investigated
by using an ethnicity-speciﬁc design the associations of a priori
indexes with CRC-speciﬁc survival. In previous studies, white
and African-American participants showed different results in
analyses of exploratory dietary patterns with the risk of colon
(45) and rectal (46) cancer; for instance, the ‘‘Western-Southern,’’
‘‘fruit-vegetable,’’ and ‘‘metropolitan’’ intake patterns were identi-
ﬁed in both ethnic groups, but the ‘‘fruit-vegetable’’ pattern was
associated with colon cancer risk in whites only (45). In rectal
cancer, the ‘‘high fat/meat/potatoes’’ intake pattern was identiﬁed in
both ethnic groups; however, this was associated with risk only in
whites (46). Associations between single foods and CRC risk also
differed by ethnicity [e.g., ﬁber consumption was signiﬁcantly
associated with lower CRC risk in African Americans but not in
whites (47)]. Ethnicity-speciﬁc differences in the bacterial coloni-
zation of the gut (48) and the frequency of genetic polymorphisms
(49) may play a role in these ﬁndings.

In contrast to the associations among colon and not rectal
cancer cases in the current study, the predominantly white NIH-
AARP Diet and Health Study reported better CRC-speciﬁc survival
for rectal cancer cases with higher prediagnostic HEI-2005 scores,
whereas no association was observed among colon cancer cases
(6). Discrepancies in the results might be explained by different
HEI versions (HEI-2005 compared with HEI-2010), which differ,
for instance, by the introduction of the food groups ‘‘seafood and
plant proteins’’ and ‘‘reﬁned grains’’ in the HEI-2010 and the
replacement of the food group ‘‘oils and saturated fat’’ in the HEI-
2005 by the food group ‘‘ratio of unsaturated fatty acids to SFAs’’
in the HEI-2010. Different ﬁndings might also be explained by
differences in sample size and ethnic composition of the study
populations. The latter may be particularly relevant because of the
higher relative proportions of African Americans diagnosed with
colon cancer (22.0%) than rectal cancer (13.9%) in the MEC.

To our knowledge, this study is the ﬁrst to investigate the
association of 4 a priori–deﬁned dietary indexes with survival
among participants diagnosed with CRC from different ethnic
backgrounds. A strength of this study was its prospective design.
Because of the large number of cases, we were able to examine
tumors at speciﬁc anatomic sites. In addition, the use of a QFFQ
designed for the relevant ethnic populations enabled us to study
heterogeneous populations with wide variations in dietary
habits and allowed for differences in usual portion sizes.
Although the validation of the QFFQ with 24-h recalls indicated
acceptable results (23), self-reported diet by QFFQ is always a
limitation that may result in nondifferential misclassiﬁcation
and attenuated risk estimates (50). Small sample sizes in some
ethnic groups may have limited our ability to detect associations
or led to spurious ﬁndings due to multiple testing. However,
when Bonferroni-corrected, the reported dietary score associations
of our main analysis in women of all ethnic groups combined
remained signiﬁcant. Given the possibility of false-positive results

1754 Jacobs et al.

due to multiple testing, the ﬁndings of our secondary analyses (i.e.,
by ethnic group, hormone treatment, and disease stage) should be
interpreted with caution. These analyses are hypothesis-generating
only and need to be replicated in other cohorts.

Given that dietary patterns may change after cancer diagnosis,
another weakness of this study is that the exposure assessment
was distant to the outcomes. Signiﬁcant correlations and small
differences between pre- and postdiagnostic dietary index scores
in a subset of 953 patients in our study indicate an acceptable
consistency, however. Covariate exposures, such as smoking
status, may also change after cancer diagnosis. However, in our
study subset with information on postdiagnostic confounders,
the vast majority of prediagnosis nonsmokers and former
smokers remained in the respective group after diagnosis,
whereas 83 current smokers stopped smoking after the diagnosis
and pre- and postdiagnostic BMI correlated well (r = 0.82).

In this multiethnic cohort, African-American women diag-
nosed with CRC whose prediagnostic diet at cohort entry was
more closely aligned with the aMED experienced lower CRC
mortality. The observed ethnicity-speciﬁc associations could
be a result of true biological differences in metabolism, genetics,
and eating patterns or due to the smaller sample sizes for
ethnicity-speciﬁc analysis, particularly for Native Hawaiians.
Our ﬁndings highlight the importance of examining relations
between dietary patterns and CRC mortality in ethnically
diverse populations but also indicate that the associations between
prediagnostic diet quality and prognosis appear to be fairly weak.
Given the multiple testing issues and small numbers of cases
within ethnic groups, the current ﬁnding of an inverse association
between the aMED and mortality in 1 of 5 ethnic groups may be
due to chance and needs replication in other cohorts.
