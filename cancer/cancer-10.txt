Background:  Epidemiologic  evidence  indicates  that  diets
high 
in  fruits  and  vegetables  are  associated  with  a
reduced  risk  of  several  cancers,  including  cancers  of  the
esophagus  and  stomach.  Vitamins  and  minerals  in  these
foods  may  contribute  to  the  reduced  cancer  risk.  The
people  of  Linxian  County,  China,  have  one  of  the  world's
highest  rates  of  esophageal/gastric  cardla  cancer  and  a
persistently  low  intake  of  several  micronutrients.  Pur-
pose:  We  sought  to  determine  if  dietary  supplementation
with  specific  vitamins  and  minerals  can  lower  mortality
from  or  incidence  of  cancer  as  well  as  mortality  from
other  diseases  in  Linxian.  Methods:  Individuals  of  ages
40-69  were  recruited 
four  Linxian
communes.  Mortality  and  cancer  incidence  during  March
1986-May  1991  were  ascertained  for  29584  adults  who
received  daily  vitamin  and  mineral 
supplementation
throughout  this  period.  The  subjects  were  randomly
assigned  to  intervention  groups  according  to  a  one-half
replicate  of  a  24  factorial  experimental  design.  This
design  enabled  testing  for  the  effects  of  four  combina-
tions  of  nutrients:  (A)  retinol  and  zinc;  (B)  riboflavin  and
niacin;  (C)  vitamin  C  and  molybdenum;  and  (D)  beta
carotene,  vitamin  E,  and  selenium.  Doses  ranged  from
one  to  two  times  U.S.  Recommended  Daily  Allowances.
Results:  A  total  of  2127  deaths  occurred  among  trial
participants  during  the  intervention  period.  Cancer  was
the  leading  cause  of  death,  with  32%  of  all  deaths  due  to
esophageal  or  stomach  cancer,  followed  by  cerebrovascu-
lar  disease  (25%).  Significantly  (P  =  .03)  lower  total
mortality  (relative  risk  [RR]  =  0.91;  95%  confidence
interval  [CI]  =  0.84-0.99)  occurred  among  those  receiving
supplementation  with  beta  carotene,  vitamin  E,  and

selenium.  The  reduction  was  mainly  due  to  lower  cancer
rates  (RR  =  0.87;  95%  CI  =  0.75-1.00),  especially
stomach  cancer  (RR  =  0.79;  95%  CI  =  0.64-0.99),  with
the  reduced  risk  beginning  to  arise  about  1-2  years  after
the  start  of  supplementation  with  these  vitamins  and
minerals.  No  significant  effects  on  mortality  rates  from
all  causes  were  found  for  supplementation  with  retinol
and  zinc,  riboflavin  and  niacin,  or  vitamin  C  and
molybdenum.  Patterns  of  cancer  incidence,  on  the  basis
of  1298  cases,  generally  resembled  those  for  cancer
mortality.  Conclusions:  The  findings  indicate  that  vitamin
and  mineral  supplementation  of  the  diet  of  Linxian
adults,  particularly  with  the  combination  of  beta  car-
otene,  vitamin  E,  and  selenium,  may  effect  a  reduction  in
cancer  risk  in  this  population.  Implications:  The  results
on  their  own  are  not  definitive,  but  the  promising
findings  should  stimulate  further  research  to  clarify  the
potential  benefits  of  micronutrient  supplements.  [J  Natl
Cancer  Inst  85:1483-1492,  1993]

Linxian,  a rural  county  in  Henan  Province  of  north-central
China,  has  one  of  the  world's  highest  rates  of  esophageal
cancer  (7).  Mortality  rates  from  this  cancer  exceed  the
Chinese  national  average  by  10-fold  and  the  American
average  for  Whites  by  100-fold  (2).  The  tumors  arise  not
only  as  squamous  cell  carcinomas  in  the esophagus,  but  also
beyond  the  esophageal-gastric  junction  as  adenocarcinomas
in  the  cardia  region  of  the  stomach.  Historically,  esophageal
and  gastric  cardia  cancers  have  been  considered  as  a  single

Table  1.  Types  and  daily  doses  of  micronutrients  by  treatment  factor

Reasons  for  the  clustering  of  esophageal-gastric  cardia
cancer  in  Linxian  are  unknown;  case-control  studies  (3,4)
have  failed  to  detect  strong  dietary  or  other  risk  factors.  A
number  of  investigations  (5)  conducted  in  other  areas  of  the
world  have  found  that  consumption  of  fresh  vegetables  and
fruits  is  associated  with  a  reduced  risk  of  both  esophageal
and  stomach  cancers.  The  particular  constituents  of  vegeta-
bles  and  fruits  responsible  for  the  protective  effect  have  not
been  determined,  but 
trends  have  been  shown
between  cancer  risk  and 
intake  of  several
micronutrients  found  in  these  foods,  especially  vitamin  C
and  beta  carotene

Food  availability  and  variety  in  Linxian  have  historically
been  limited.  Although  completion  of  a  massive  agricultural
irrigation  system  in  1965  resulted  in  increased  production  of
several  foods,  diets  typically  have  remained  low  in  intake  of
fresh  fruits  and  meat  and  other  animal  products.  The  major
staples  are  corn,  millet,  sweet  potatoes,  and  wheat.  In
surveys  {8-11)  of  Linxian  residents  during  the  1970s  and
early  1980s,  blood  levels  of  various  micronutrients,  includ-
ing  retinol,  beta  carotene,  riboflavin,  vitamin  C,  and  vitamin
E  were  consistently 
low  by  Western  standards,  although
overt  clinical  deficiencies  were  not  common.

subclinical

multiple  vitamins  and  minerals  might  reduce  the  rates  of
cancer.  One  trial  involved  approximately  3300  participants
with  esophageal  dysplasia  and  is  the  subject  of  another
article  in  this  issue  of  the  Journal  (12).  In  this  presentation,
we  describe  results  from  a  larger  trial 
involving  nearly
30000  residents  from  the  high-risk  Linxian  general  popula-
tion.  We  present  tests  of  the  initial  effectiveness  of  four
specific  combinations  of  vitamins  and  minerals  in  reducing
cancer  incidence  and  mortality  as  well  as  mortality  from
other  diseases  during  the  course  of  the  intervention.

While  a  separate  evaluation  of  each  of  the  nine,  and  perhaps  additional,
nutrients  listed  in  Table  1  would  have  been  desirable,  a  29  or  higher
factorial  experiment  was  impractical.  The  feasible  options  were  to  delete
certain  nutrients  or  to  combine  them  into  a  smaller  number  of  groups.  We
chose  the  latter  approach,  combining  zinc,  which  enhances  the  delivery  of
retinol  to  tissues,  and  retinol  (Factor  A);  the  B  vitamins  riboflavin  and
niacin  (Factor  B);  vitamin  C  and  molybdenum,  which  are  thought  to  inhibit
the 
formation  of  carcinogenic  nitrosamines  and  nitrosamine-induced
esophageal  carcinogenesis,  respectively  (Factor  C);  and  the  fat-soluble
antioxidants  beta  carotene,  vitamin  E,  and  selenium  (Factor  D). A  fractional
factorial  design  was  selected  because  it  permitted  testing  of  the  main
effects  of  four  factors  at  less  cost  and  complexity  than  a  full  24  factorial
design.  The  eight  intervention  groups  in  this  fractional  design  were  defined
by  the  following  combinations  of  supplements:  AB,  AC,  AD,  BC,  BD,  CD,
ABCD,  or  placebo.  Thus,  persons  in  group  AB,  e.g.,  received  retinol,  zinc,
riboflavin,  and  niacin,  while  those  in  group  ABCD  received  all  nine
vitamins  and  minerals  and  those  in  the  placebo  group  received  none.  This
choice  of  groups  resulted  in  half  the  participants  receiving  each  of  the  four
factor  nutrient  combinations.  For  example,  half  received  factor  A  (AB,  AC,
AD,  ABCD)  and  half  did  not  (BC,  BD,  CD,  placebo),  and  the  subjects  that
received  versus  those  that  did  not  receive  factor  A  were  balanced  with
respect  to  receipt  of  all  other  nutrients.

The  eight  vitamin/mineral  combinations  were  packaged  in  coded  bottles
containing  a  1-month  supply  and  were  distributed  monthly  by  approx-
imately  200  village  doctors  beginning 
in  March  1986  and  continuing
through  May  1991.  Compliance  was  assessed  in  two  ways:  by  counting
unused  pills  and  by  assaying  nutrient 
from
approximately  120  individuals  randomly  selected  without  replacement  every
3  months  during  the  course  of  the  trials.

Subjects  and  Methods

Participants  in  the  trial  were  recruited  in  1985  from  four  communes  in
Linxian.  Residents  aged  40-69  years  without  debilitating  diseases  or  prior
esophageal  or  stomach  cancer  who  were  willing  to  take  part  in  a  multiyear,
daily  pill-taking  regimen  were  sought  for  enrollment.  These  individuals
were  given  a  brief  physical  examination,  had  a  10-mL  blood  sample
collected  and  stored,  and  were  interviewed  regarding  aspects  of  their
medical,  family,  dietary,  and  tobacco  and  alcohol  consumption  histories.
The  participants  were  randomly  assigned  to  receive  one  of  eight  vitamin/
mineral  supplement  combinations  in  the  form  of  individual  oral  tablets.  The
treatment  combinations  were  randomly  assigned  within  blocks  defined  by
commune  (four  communes),  sex,  and  age  (by  single  years).  The  eight
intervention  groups  were  derived  from  a  one-half  replicate  of  a  2*  factorial
design  (13).  The  factorial  design  allowed  us  to  assess  four  factors  (i.e.,
nutrient  combinations)  in  a  single  experiment.  The  four  factors,  which  we
designate  by  the  letters  A,  B,  C,  and  D,  are  defined  in  Table  1.  Doses  of
each  nutrient  ranged  from  one  to  two  times  U.S.  Recommended  Daily
Allowances  (RDAs).

(RRs)  of  mortality  and  cancer  incidence  and  corresponding  95%  confidence

variables.  Additional  adjustment  for  baseline  data  on  cigarette  smoking  and

in  this  population,  resulted  in  essentially  no  change  and  is  not  presented.

allowed  for  a  latency  period  before  a  treatment  effect  might  occur.  Tests
for  pairwise  interactions  between  factors  were  able  to  be  calculated,  but
with  the  fractional  design,  only  three  of  the  six  two-way  interactions  could
be  evaluated.  Furthermore,  because  the  interaction  between  any  two  of  the
four  factors,  say  A  and  B,  is  mathematically  equivalent  to  the  interaction
between  the  remaining  two  factors  (i.e.,  C  and  D),  interactive  effects  for
one  pair  cannot  be  distinguished  from  the  other.  Thus,  these  tests  were  not

mortality  and  incidence  by  calendar  quarter  throughout  the  study  period.
All  P  values  associated  with  comparisons  of  those  receiving  versus  those
not  receiving  a  particular  vitamin/mineral  factor  are  nominal  and  based  on
two-sided  tests,  even  though  one-sided  tests  would  have  been  appropriate
because  of  the  a  priori  hypotheses  of  beneficial  effects  of  the  supplements.

Results

Of  the  approximately  50000  potentially  eligible  partici-
pants,  16% refused  to  participate,  12%  were  out  of  the  area,
3%  were  too  sick,  and  8%  did  not  join  the  trial  for  other
reasons.  In  addition,  1.4%  were  excluded  due 
to  self-
reported  cancer  at  screening  or  death  or  diagnosis  of  cancer
prior  to  the  start  of  intervention.  After  these  exclusions,  the
study  population  consisted  of  29584  randomly  assigned
participants.  Characteristics  of  these  individuals  are  given  in
Table  2.  The  various  treatment  groups  were  well  balanced
with  regard  to  sex,  age,  smoking,  alcohol  consumption,  and
diet  and  familial  cancer  history.

Compliance  assessed  by  monthly  pill  counts  and  bio-
chemical  measures  was  excellent  throughout  the  study.  The
overall  pill  disappearance  rate  was  93%  for  all  participants,
with  no  difference  by  treatment  group  (range,  92%-93%)  and
little  change  during  the  trial  (range,  92%-93%  in  year  1;

showed 
for
individuals  who  received  supplementation  compared  with
those  who  did  not;  the  proportional  increase  was  greatest  for
beta  carotene  (Table  3).  In  contrast,  there  were  no  significant
differences 
in  baseline  levels,  except  for  lower  ascorbate
levels  in  those  who  received  vitamin  C  and  molybdenum.
A  total  of  2127  deaths  (7.2%  of  the  study  participants)
occurred  during  the  period  March  1986-May  1991.  The
percentages  of  deaths  were  higher  among  men  (9.3%)  than
women  (5.5%)  and  rose  with  age  at  start  of  follow-up  (2.3%
age  <50,  7.3% age  50-59,  and  17.3% age  5=60). Cancer  was
the  leading  cause  of  death,  accounting  for  37% of  all  deaths.
Of  the  792  cancer  deaths,  87%  (or  32%  of  all  deaths)  were
attributed 
the  esophagus  (360  deaths)  or
stomach  (331  deaths;  253  from  gastric  cardia  and  78  from
other  stomach  cancers).  There  were  101  deaths  from  other

observed  among  persons  receiving  pills  with  beta  carotene,

There  was  a  9%  reduction  in  overall  mortality  (RR  =  0.91;
95%  CI  = 0.84-0.99)  among  those  receiving  factor  D.  Cancer
mortality  among  this  group  was  reduced  13%  (RR  =  0.87;

reduced  10%  (RR  =  0.90;  95%  CI  =  0.77-1.05).  The
decrease  in  cancer  mortality  among  those  receiving  beta
carotene,  vitamin  E,  and  selenium  was  more  pronounced  for
stomach  (RR  =  0.79)  and  other  (RR  =  0.80)  cancers  than  for
esophageal  cancers  (RR  =  0.96),  but  differences  between
these  RRs  were  not  significant  (/>>.10).  The  lower  risk  for

vitamin  E,  and  selenium.  Cancer  rates  overlapped  until
approximately  1  year  (total  cancer;  Fig.  1)  or  2  years
(stomach  cancer;  Fig.  2)  after  the  start  of  the  intervention
and  then 
tended  to  diverge.  None  of  the  other  factors
showed  a  progressive  benefit  of  the  kind  seen  in  Figs.  1 or

cantly  (f  =  .02)  lower  among  those  receiving  retinol  and
zinc,  but  cardia  cancer  rates  were  elevated  and  there  was  no
overall  reduction  in  stomach  cancer  death  rates  in  this  group.
Patterns  for  cancer  incidence  resembled  those  for  cancer
mortality  (Table  6).  In  total,  1298  persons  were  diagnosed

Discussion

The  findings  from 

trial  provide
support  for  the  hypothesis  that  intake  of  specific  micro-

this  large  randomized 

in  cancer  mortality  and 

nutrients  may  inhibit  cancer  development.  Reductions  in
total  mortality  and 
incidence,
especially  for  stomach  cancer,  were observed  over  a  5'/4-year
period  for  the  nearly  15000  individuals  who  received  daily
supplements  containing  beta  carotene,  vitamin  E,  and
selenium.  A  reduction  in  esophageal  cancer  incidence  was
also  suggested  among  those  receiving  riboflavin  and  niacin.
No  other  nutrient  combination  demonstrated  any  clear
beneficial  effects  on  cancer  rates.

intervention  groups  guaranteed  equity  between 

nutrients  and  an  extraordinarily  high  incidence  of  epithelial
cancers  thought  to  be  influenced  by  diet  and  nutritional
status.  The  random  allocation  within  strata  of  individuals  to
the

groups  by  age  and  sex,  facilitated  balance  with  respect  to
unmeasured  factors,  and  helped  to  avoid  confounding.  The
participant  compliance  was  exceptional:  Pill  disappearance
(implying  apparent 
ingestion)  exceeded  90%,  and  blood
collections  from  randomly  selected  individuals  every  quarter
provided  biochemical  confirmation  of  excellent  compliance.

1300  cancers—yielded  excellent  power  and  precise  estima-

There  are  several  caveats,  however, 

that  should  be
considered  in  interpreting  the  trial  findings.  Some  concern
the  study  design.  An  advantage  of  the  factorial  design  is  the
ability  to  test  several  hypotheses  simultaneously.  However,
with  four  independent  tests  of  main  effects,  the  chance  that
one  will  be  significant  at  the  P=£.03  level  is  .11  (i.e.,  1  -
.974)  as  a  result  of  the  multiple  comparisons.  Secondly,  the
fractional  factorial  design  confounds  main  effects  with  three-
way  interaction  effects,  so  what  we  attribute  to  factor  D
might  actually  be  an  ABC  interaction.  Such  interactions  are
typically  rare  and  seem  much  less  likely  than  an  effect  due
to  a  single  factor,  however,  and  can  likely  be  dismissed.
Finally, 
the  Linxian  setting,  a
relatively  remote,  rural  area  of  China  with  a  population
marginally  deficient 
in  a  number  of  nutrients,  suggest
caution  in  extrapolating  the  findings  to  other  populations.

mortality  from  stomach  cancer  (21%  reduction)  and  other

Studies  in  experimental  animals  (6,7)  have  demonstrated
the  cancer  inhibitory  properties  of  beta  carotene,  vitamin  E,

and  selenium.  For  example,  beta  carotene  has 
inhibited
formation  of  UV-induced  skin  cancers,  oral  carcinomas
caused  by  dimethylbenzanthracene  exposure,  and  colon
tumors  that  develop  following  dimethylhydrazine  exposure.
Vitamin  E  and  selenium  have  also  lowered  the  incidence  of
tumors  in  a  number  of  experiments  involving  exposure  to
different  carcinogens,  although  some  studies  (6,7)  suggested
either  no effect  or  enhancement  of  carcinogenesis.  Vitamin  E
has  been  shown  to  inhibit  nitrosamine-induced  esophageal
cancer  in  mice  (75).

The  epidemiologic  evidence 

is  also  consistent  with  a
beneficial  role  of  beta  carotene,  vitamin  E,  and  selenium  on
cancer  risk  (5,6).  It  has  repeatedly  been  shown  that  intake  of
fresh  fruits  and  vegetables  is  associated  with  reduced  risks
of  esophageal,  stomach,  and  total  cancer  (5).  Risks  among
persons  having  the  highest  intakes  often  are  as  low  as  one
half  of  those  having  the  lowest  intakes  for  several  foods,
especially  citrus  and  other  fruits  and  fresh  green,  orange,  and
yellow  vegetables.  Although  it  has  been  difficult  to  identify
specific  components  of  these  foods  that  may  be  responsible
for  the  decreased  risk,  a  role  for  beta  carotene  and  possibly
other  carotenoids  has  been  suggested  by  case-control  studies
of  esophageal  and  stomach  cancers,  including  studies  in
China  (5,6,16-18).  Difficulty  in  estimating  dietary  intakes  of
vitamin  E  and  selenium  has  limited  evaluation  of  their
effects.  However,  in  Italy,  the  largest  case-control  study  (19)
of  stomach  cancer  conducted  to  date  found  that  risks  of
cancers  of  the  stomach,  including  gastric  cardia,  were  more
closely  correlated  with  an  index  of  dietary  vitamin  E  than  of
beta  carotene,  although  the  opposite  pattern  was  reported  in
Canada  (20).

Further  supporting  evidence  for  a  protective  effect  of  beta
carotene,  vitamin  E,  and  selenium  comes  from  observations
of  inverse  associations  of  blood  levels  of  these  nutrients  with
risk  of  several  cancers,  including  those  of  the  esophagus  and
stomach.  Ecologic  surveys  (21-23)  across  rural  Chinese
counties  found  that  plasma  levels  of  selenium  were  inversely
correlated  with  mortality  rates  for  both  esophageal  and
stomach  cancers,  while  plasma  beta  carotene  was  signifi-
cantly  lower  in  counties  with  high  stomach  cancer  rates.  In
Linxian,  blood  levels  of  beta  carotene  and  alpha-tocopherol
are  consistently  lower  than  Western  norms,  while  levels  of
selenium  are  near  normal  or  only  marginally  lower  (8-11).  In

Only  a  few  observational  studies  have  evaluated  risk  of
cancer  in  relation  to  use  of  vitamin  or  mineral  supplements.
In  a  U.S.  hospital-based  study  (26)  of  133  male  esophageal
cancer  patients,  risk  was  50%  lower  among  users  of  vitamin
E  supplements.  A  50%  reduction  in  risk  of  oral  cancer  also
was  reported  among  users  of  vitamin  E  supplements  in  a
national  study 
that  enrolled  over  1000  American
patients.

(27) 

Several  clinical  trials  have  shown  beneficial  effects  of
beta  carotene  or  vitamin  E  on  precancerous  lesions.  In  a  20-
month  randomized  trial  in  Uzbekistan  (28),  daily  doses  of  40
mg  of  beta  carotene  together  with  weekly  supplements  of
100000  IU  of  retinol  and  80  mg  of  vitamin  E  were
associated  with  endoscopically  determined  regression  of
chronic  esophagitis  (although  the  effect  was  not  statistically
significant) 
in  oral
leukoplakia.  Several  other  trials  (29-31)  have  also  reported
reversals  in  oral  leukoplakia,  thought  to  be  a  precursor  to
oral  cancer,  following  supplementation  with  beta  carotene  or
vitamin  E.  Furthermore,  beta  carotene  combined  with  retinol
lowered  the  frequency  of  buccal  micronuclei  among  betel
chewers  in  the  Philippines  (32),  while  beta  carotene  alone
reduced  the  prevalence  of  micronuclei 
in  the  sputum  of
smokers  in  the  Netherlands  (55).

No  other  randomized  clinical  trials  have  reported  on  the
effects  on  esophageal  or  stomach  cancers  of  supplementation
with  beta  carotene,  vitamin  E,  or  selenium.  In  the  only
reported  cancer 
(34),  daily  50-mg  beta  carotene
supplementation  was  not  found  to  be  effective  in  inhibiting
second  primary  basal  or  squamous  cell  skin  cancers  among
patients  with  nonmelanoma  skin  cancer.  In 
the  smaller
parallel 
that  we  conducted  among  persons  with
esophageal  dysplasia  in  Linxian,  described  in  a  companion
paper  (12),  total  cancer  mortality  and  incidence  rates  were
similar  between  those  receiving  6  years  of  supplementation
with  26  vitamins  and  minerals  (including  beta  carotene,
vitamin  E,  and  selenium)  and  those  receiving  placebo.  Inter-
vention  trials  involving  beta  carotene,  vitamin  E,  and/or
selenium  and  assessing  cancer  end  points  are  ongoing  in
populations  in  the  United  States  and  Finland.  Although  the
numbers  of  esophageal  or  stomach  cancers  likely  to  arise  in
these  trials  will  be  considerably  smaller  than  in  Linxian,
evaluation  of  the  effects  of  supplementation  on  these  cancers
should  be  possible.

The  mechanisms  by  which  beta  carotene,  vitamin  E,  or
selenium  inhibit  cancer  development  are  not  clear,  but  might
involve  their  antioxidant  properties  (6).  These  compounds,
especially  beta  carotene,  can  quench  free  radicals  and  protect
against  oxidative  damage  to  DNA.  The  nutrients  also  inhibit
the  endogenous  formation  of  N-nitroso  compounds,  some  of
which  are  potent  carcinogens  in  animal  experiments  and  are

suspected  risk  factors  for  stomach  and  esophageal  cancers  in
human  populations,  including  Linxian's  (35,36).  Beta  car-
otene,  vitamin  E,  and  selenium  may  also  possess  immu-
nologic  and  other  properties  that  influence  carcinogenesis
(6).  We  could  not  directly  evaluate  mechanistic  pathways,

stomach  cancer  mortality  was
observed  among  those  receiving  retinol  and  zinc,  but  it  was
counterbalanced  by  an  increase 
in  gastric  cardia  cancer

cancer  risk  has  been  postulated  on  the  basis  of  its  role  in
maintaining  cell 
integrity  and  on  the  ability  of  certain
retinoids  to  inhibit  chemically  induced  tumors  in  laboratory
animals,  although  in  some  experimental  models,  vitamin  A

(6).
Epidemiologic  support  for  a  beneficial  effect  of  vitamin  A,
although  suggestive  at  one  time,  has  waned  since  the  trial
began.  Several 
found  no
evidence  of  a protective  effect  of  dietary  or  serum  retinol  for
esophageal  or  stomach  cancers,  with  the  consensus  suggest-
ing  that  benefits  are  associated  with  the  vitamin  A  precursor
beta  carotene  (37).  In  clinical  trials  (38),  however,  high
isotretinoin  have  proven

incidence  of  second  primary

in  oral  cancer  patients.
Although  human  data  on  the  relationship  between  zinc  and
cancer  are  limited,  zinc  was  included  because  it  enhances
delivery  of  retinol  to  body  tissues  and  because  esophageal
carcinogenesis  is  promoted  in  zinc-deficient  rats  (39).  It  is
noteworthy 
that  in  a  randomized  trial  (40)  in  a  county
neighboring  Linxian,  13  months  of  supplementation  with
retinol  (50000  IU  per  week)  and  zinc  (50  mg  per  week)
along  with  high  doses  (200  mg  per  week)  of  riboflavin  had
no  effect  on  the  prevalence  of  precancerous  esophageal
lesions.  The  frequencies  of  buccal  micronuclei  also  were

elevated  esophageal  cancer  rates  is  low  dietary  intake  of  B
vitamins,  particularly  riboflavin  and  niacin  (42).  Indeed,
riboflavin  status  as  measured  by  erythrocyte  glutathione
reductase  activity  was  severely  depressed  in  Linxian  when
compared  with  the  United  States;  over  90%  of  the  Linxian
population  was  termed  deficient 
(8-11).
Riboflavin  deficiencies  have  induced  esophageal  hyperplasia
in  baboons  and  altered 
the  metabolism  of  nitrosamines
(43,44).  Supplementation  with  riboflavin  and  niacin,  along
with  zinc,  magnesium,  and  molybdenum,  inhibited  esopha-
geal  carcinogenesis  in  corn-fed  rats  (45).  In  Uzbekistan,

however,  supplementation  with  riboflavin  for  20  months  was
not  successful 
in  reversing  chronic  esophagitis  (28).  We
found  that  esophageal  cancer  incidence  and  mortality  were
14%  and  10%  lower,  respectively,  among  those  receiving
daily

reduction 
incidence  of  borderline
statistical  significance.  Total  cancer  incidence  or  mortality,
however,  was  only  slightly  reduced  among  those  receiving  B
vitamin  supplementation,  thus  providing  only  weak  support
for  a  protective  effect.  On  the  other  hand,  the  limited  a
priori  evidence  suggests  that  a  benefit  from  riboflavin  and
niacin  may  be  more  pronounced  for  esophageal  cancer.
Thus,  we  view  the  finding  of  lowered  esophageal  cancer
incidence  as  an  encouraging  sign  worthy  of  additional
investigation.

Vitamin  C  has  been  suggested  as  protective  against
several  cancers,  particularly  stomach  cancer  (6).  Although
results  of  experimental  studies  are  mixed,  most  case-control
studies  of  stomach  and  esophageal  cancers  have  shown  that
adult  diets  of  the  patients  typically  are  low  in  intake  of

showed  no evidence  of  reduced  cancer  mortality  or  incidence
(in  fact,  the  RRs  were  above  1.0)  among  persons  receiving
daily  vitamin  C  and  molybdenum  supplements  at  doses

The  failure  of  this  trial  to  find  significant  reductions  in

protective  effect  on  the  early  stages  of  carcinogenesis,  our
focus  on  concurrent  events  in  adults  taking  the  supplements
would  not  be  expected  to  show  a  mortality  differential.  The
data  suggest  only  that  supplementation  with  these  particular
nutrients  resulted  in  no  demonstrable  short-term  mortality
benefit.  Continued  monitoring  of 
the  participants  will
determine  whether  any  reductions  in  cancer  or  other  disease
may  emerge  in  the  coming  years.

from  cerebrovascular  disease  was  10% 

Several  reports  have  suggested  that  antioxidant  nutrients
may  reduce 
the  risk  or  progression  of  cerebrovascular
disease,  a  common  cause  of  death  in  Linxian,  and  perhaps
lower  the  rate  of  hypertension,  a  strong  risk  factor  (6,47-49).
We  found  no  significant  treatment  group  differences,  but
mortality 
lower
among  those  receiving  supplements  with  the  antioxidants

of  antioxidants  on  cerebrovascular  disease  may  be  caused  by

lowered  risk  of  cardiovascular  disease  has  been  reported
among  American  men  and  women 
taking  vitamin  E
supplements  (51,52).  Furthermore, 
trial
among  U.S.  physicians  (53),  beta  carotene  was  found  to

plasma  levels  of  carotene  and  vitamins  E  and  C  have  been
inversely  related  to  risk  of  angina  (54).  Only  1%  of  the
deaths  among  Linxian  trial  participants  were  attributed  to
ischemic  heart  disease,  limiting  evaluation  of  intervention
effects,  but  we  found  little  or  no  reduction  in  mortality  from
cardiovascular  disease  among  those  receiving  beta  carotene,
vitamin  E,  and  selenium.

the  Linxian 

In  summary,  when 

trial  observations  are
combined  with  the  epidemiologic,  experimental,  and  biolog-
ical  evidence  at  hand,  it  seems  plausible  that  the  lowered
cancer  rates  represent  a  protective  effect  of  beta  carotene,
vitamin  E,  and  selenium  intervention.  Although  pill  supple-
mentation  ceased  in  the  summer  of  1991, continued  follow-
up  of  the  Linxian  participants  over  the  coming  years  is
planned.  In  this  manner,  persistence  of  the  lowered  mortality
associated  with  beta  carotene,  vitamin  E,  and  selenium  and
the  reduced  esophageal  cancer  incidence  associated  with
riboflavin  and  niacin  can  be  evaluated  along  with 
the
potential 
long-term  effects  of  each  of  the  four  nutrient
combinations  after  intervention.  Shorter-term  trials  are  also
planned  in  the  context  of  a  gastric  screening  project  in
another  high-risk  area  of  China  to  assess  the  effectiveness  of
beta  carotene  versus  vitamin  E  versus  selenium  in  inhibiting

results  should  be  considered  preliminary  in  nature,  they  offer

Nutrition  Intervention  Trials  in  Linxian,  China:
Multiple  Vitamin/Mineral  Supplementation,
Cancer  Incidence,  and  Disease-Specific  Mortality
Among  Adults  With  Esophageal  Dysplasia

Background:  A  number  of  vitamins  and  minerals  have
been  shown  to  influence  carcinogenesis  in  experimental
animals.  In  humans,  epidemiologic  evidence  suggests  that
intake  of  fruits  and  vegetables  may  reduce  risk  of
esophageal  and  other  cancers.  Vitamins  and  minerals  in
these  foods  may  contribute  to  the  reduced  cancer  risk.
The  people  of  Linxian,  China,  have  persistently 
low
intake  of  multiple  nutrients  and  exhibit  one  of  the
world's  highest  rates  of  esophageal/gastric  cardia  cancer,
with  an  exceptionally  high  risk  of  esophageal  dysplasia.
Purpose:  To  determine  whether  supplementation  with
multiple  vitamins  and  minerals  may  reduce  esophageal/
gastric  cardia  cancer  among  persons  with  esophageal
dysplasia,  we  conducted  a  6-year  prospective  intervention
trial  in  Linxian.  Methods:  Mortality  and  cancer  incidence
were  ascertained  from  May  1985  through  May  1991  for
3318  persons  with  cytologic  evidence  of  esophageal
dysplasia  who  were  randomly  assigned 
to  receive,
throughout  that  period,  daily  supplementation  with  14
vitamins  and  12  minerals  or  placebo.  Doses  were
typically  two  to  three  times  U.S.  Recommended  Daily
Allowances.  Compliance  was  assessed  by  counting  unused
pills  monthly  for  all  trial  participants  and  by  assaying
nutrient 
from  samples  of
individuals  randomly  selected  without  replacement  every
3  months  throughout  the  trial.  Cancers  were  identified
through  routine  surveillance  and  by  special  cytology  and
endoscopy  screenings  after  2lA years  and  6 years.  Results:
A  total  of  324  deaths  occurred  during  the  6-year  inter-
vention  period;  167  occurred  in  the  control  (placebo)
group  and  157  occurred  in  the  supplement  group.  Cancer
was  the  leading  cause  of  death  (54%  of  all  deaths);  18%
were  due  to  cerebrovascular  diseases  and  29%  to  other
causes.  Cumulative  esophageal/gastric  cardia  death  rates
were  8%

receiving  supplements  rather  than  placebo,  a  nonsignifi-
cant  (P>.IO)  difference.  Risk  of  total  mortality  was  7%
lower  (RR  =  0.93;  95%  CI  =  0.75-1.16;  P>.10), 
total
cancer  4%  lower  (RR  =  0.96;  95%  CI  =  0.71-1.29;
P>.10),  cerebrovascular  disease  38%  lower  (RR  =  0.62;
95%  CI  =  0J7-1.06;  P  =  .08),  and  other  diseases  12%
higher  (RR  =  1.12;  95%  CI  =  0.74-1.69;  P>.10)  among
the  treated  group.  Cumulative  cancer  incidence  rates
were  nearly  the  same  in  the  two  groups.  Conclusions:  No
substantial  short-term  beneficial  effect  on  incidence  or
mortality  for  this  type  of  cancer  occurred  following  daily
supplementation  with  multiple  vitamins  and  minerals
among  adults  with  precancerous  lesions  of  the  esophagus.
Implications:  Although  no  statistically  significant  short-
term  benefits  were  observed,  longer  follow-up  should  be
more  informative  about  the  effectiveness  of  this  6-year
supplementation  on  cancer  and  other  diseases  among
individuals  with  esophageal  dysplasia.  [J  Natl  Cancer

Rates  of  esophageal/gastric  cardia  cancer  in  Linxian,  a
rural  county  in  Henan  Province,  north-central  China,  are
among  the  highest  in  the  world  (7).  The  excess  risk  is
especially  pronounced  among  persons  with  esophageal
dysplasia,  a precancerous  lesion  affecting  over  20% of  adults
in  this  area  (2,5).  The  excess  cancers  occur  not  only  as
squamous  cell  carcinomas  of  the  esophagus,  but  also  as
adenocarcinomas  of  the  gastric  cardia.  Traditionally,  both
tumors  have  been  called  "esophageal  cancer"  in  Linxian
because  of  their  proximity  to  one  another  and  similarity  in
symptoms.
