Cancer Causes and Control 1994, 5, 73 - 82 Alcoholic beverage consumption in relation to risk of breast cancer: meta-analysis and review Matthew P. Longnecker (Received 16 August 1993; accepted in revised form 5 October 1993) The objective was to evaluate the association between alcohol consumption and risk of breast cancer. Data from 38 epidemiologic studies on alcohol consumption in relation to risk of breast cancer in women were included in a meta-analysis. A qualitative literature review also was conducted. The results showed strong evidence of a dose-response relation; however, the slope of the dose-response curve was quite modest. For example, daily consumption of one alcoholic drink was associated with an 11 percent increase (95 percent confidence interval, seven to 16 percent) in the risk of breast cancer compared with nondrinkers. An expla-nation for the marked variation in results across studies was not found. The modest size of the association and variation in results across studies leave the causal role of alcohol in question. The evidence that alcohol con- sumption affects the risk of breast cancer, however, appears to be growing stronger.

We conduc- ted a meta-analysis of the alcohol/breast cancer-asso- ciation in 1988 and found strong evidence of a dose-response association but insufficient evidence to determine whether the association were causal. 1 Since the original meta-analysis, the number of published studies on this topic has more than doubled. The goal of the present study was to reevaluate the alcohol/ breast cancer-association after (i) including the newer data in a meta-analysis, (ii) employing newer meta- analytic methods, (iii) searching for factors that might explain the variation in findings across studies, and (iv) reviewing qualitatively all the available data. Materials and methods Data from case-control and follow-up studies on alcohol consumption in relation to risk of breast cancer were eligible. We considered results presented in manuscripts, letters, and abstracts that were published in English. Specifically, studies potentially eligible for inclusion were identified as follows: (i) a literature search using the MEDLINE database from 1966 through September 1992; (ii) an examination of the ref- erences in reports found by the first method; and (iii) a search of all abstracts presented at the Society for Epi- demiologic Research in the past five years. The relative risks (RR) and associated variances, which had been adjusted for the greatest number of potentially confounding variables were abstracted from the original reports and included in the meta- analysis. For each RR, a median alcohol consumption for the corresponding category of alcohol intake was estimated. The calculations were based on the age-specific distribution of alcohol consumption among female participants in the Alcohol Supplement of the 1983 National Health Interview Survey. 2 Dr Longnecker is with the Department of Epidemiology, UCLA School of Public Health, 10833 Le Conte Avenue, Los Angeles, CA 90024-1772, USA, The author is a recipient of an American Cancer Society Junior Faculty Research Award.

Vol 5. 1994 73 M. P. Longnecker A slope for the (log) linear 'dose-response' curve in each of the original studies was calculated as follows. The log RR of breast cancer was modeled as a function of alcohol intake? Weighted least-squares regression was used with weights equal to the inverse variance of the log RR for each category of alcohol consumption. For each series of RRs that were calculated using a common reference category of alcohol consumption (abstainers), we estimated their covariance and incor- porated this into our estimates of the slopes. 4 We then fitted weighted least-square fixed-effects models of the study-specific summary-effect estimates (slopes), adding covariate terms to represent study character- istics? The weights in this case were the inverse vari- ances of the slope estimates. Similar methods were used to fit models of log RR that allowed fitting of quadratic dose-response models. 4,5 We also checked that use of a linear dose-response model was appropriate by using a nonparametric approach (see Appendix I). Considerable variation-in the effect size across studies was evident. We, therefore, also summarized the association using random effects models. 6 Under the random effects model, a Gaussian distribution of study effects (slopes) is assumed, and the overall sum- mary reflects the average of this hypothetical distribution. The quality of the studies included in the analysis was evaluated according to criteria that have been pub- lished elsewhere. 1 Results presented in abstracts were not evaluated for quality because their brevity pre- cluded a complete assessment. Results Meta-analysis We identified 50 publications with data that were potentially eligible for inclusion in the meta-analysis TM (Tables 1 and 2). Thirteen reports were excluded for one of the following reasons (Table 2): if, for subjects in a given category of alcohol consumption, the amount of alcohol consumed daily was not clear; 12,24,32 this exclusion also applied to studies that presented the RR for drinkers compared with nondrinkers without further analysis; ~8,3s,38,ss if data in a study were super- seded by that in a subsequent report; ~3,2~,26 if the results were implausible 5~ (subjects who drank less than 0.5 g of alcohol daily had RRs of breast cancer from two to seven); if the RRs associated with categories of alcohol consumption were not presented; 23 and if the study was an analysis of pooled data. 4~ In the latter case, the separ- ate studies included in the pooled analysis are listed in Table I under the names of the original investigators. After the exclusions described above, data from 38 74 Cancer Causes and Control. Vol 5. 1994 studies remained. This included two separate studies that were presented in one publication? 6 Of the 38, 10 were follow-up studies and 28 were case-control studies. The results of three studies were published as abstracts 41,42,49 and three as letters; 14,15,22 the remainder were peer-reviewed journal articles. All of the results included in the meta-analysis had been published since 1982. Nineteen studies had been conducted in the United States, five in Italy, and the remainder in other developed western countries, including Argentina and Greece. The coefficients reflecting the study-specific sum- mary measures of association (the/3 coefficient for change in log RR per gram of alcohol consumed daily) varied from -0.04331 to 0.05617 (Table I). For 13 g of alcohol (about one drink) daily, this corresponds to RRs of 0.57 (e13176 and 2.07 (e13176176 respectively. The test for trend in effect across exposure categories was significantly positive for 15 studies, significantly negative for three studies, and nonsignificant for 20 studies. (/3/SE[/3], the trend statistic, follows a standard normal distribution.) The studies in which the associ- ation was greatest (positive or negative) tended to be the studies with the smallest sample size; the studies by Schatzkin 1~ and Van't Veer ~7 are good examples. The relative size of the studies is clearer when the inverse variances of their effect estimates are considered. The weight of the studies in Table 1 ranges from 2.50 x 10 s (1/0.00022) for the Garfinkel study, ~9 to 1.29 x 10 ~ (1/0.02792) for the Schatzkin study. 1~ In other words, the range in study weight is about 200-fold. The weighted histogram, which shows the weight of evidence for an association of a given size, looks some- what Gaussian (Figure 1), although several obser- vations were outliers. The evidence in most studies suggests that for one drink daily the RR was greater than one. Based on the appearance of this distribution alone, the average RR associated with one drink daily is about 1.1. Below an RR of 0.9, there were few obser- vations, suggesting publication bias27 However, assuming a symmetrical distribution, the omitted studies were probably small. In the fixed-effects model of log RR in all studies combined, the/3 coefficient was 0.0074 (SE 0.00064) per gram of alcohol daily (linear model). For one alcoholic drink daily, this gives an RR of 1.10, with a 95 percent confidence interval (CI) of 1.08-1.17. When a quadratic term was fitted to these data, the fit of the model was improved (P < 0.005). For one drink daily, the RRs predicted by the two models were 1.10 (linear) and 1.13 (quadratic); for two drinks daily, the values were 1.21 and 1.25; and for three, the RRs were 1.33 and 1.37. Because the linear and the quadratic models pre- dicted nearly equivalent RRs for a given dose of alcohol Table 1.

The slope for the random effects model was 0.0083 (standard error [SE] --0.0015) per gram of alcohol daily. Multivariate fixed-effects models were used to evaluate sources of variation in the study findings. Variation in the size of the association by study design (case-control cf follow-up) was not evident. Among case-control studies, whether the controls were from the community or from a hospital did not matter. After stratifying by design and source of controls, study quality was not associated with results. In all studies together, the year in which data were collected from subjects was not related to results. Per capita alcohol intake in the country where the study was done was an important modifier of the dose-response slope, with stronger associations evident in countries where the per capita intake was highest. Among follow-up studies, studies with the greatest length of follow-up showed the weakest alcohol/breast-cancer association. While some of the variation in study results was due to per capita alcohol intake and length of follow-up, there was still much unexplained variation in the results of the studies (residual heterogeneity) even after taking the effects of these covariates into account. We used random effects models to assess the sensi- tivity of the results to publication bias. We assumed that there were unpublished studies the size of Willett's cohort, 9 and calculated that if the RR per drink per day in these was 0.85--as suggested by the weighted histo- gram-and if seven such studies existed and were included in the calculations, the overall summary esti- mate would be reduced by half (but would still be sig- nificant). We also calculated that if data from hypothetical unpublished studies with an RR of one were included, 25 such studies would have to exist for the overall summary estimate to be reduced by half (as before, the summary estimate would still be signifi- cant). In either case, it seems implausible that so many large unpublished studies exist with an inverse or null finding. Because of the possibility that the results of the large Cancer and Steroid Hormone (CASH) study were biased, 58 we recalculated the random effects (RE) sum- mary after excluding the data from the report of Chu et al. 29 The B coefficient for change in log RR per gram of alcohol consumed daily was 0.0086 (SE = 0.0015), compared with 0.0083 (SE = 0.0015) before the exclusion. (Corresponding RRs for one drink daily are 1.12 and 1.11.) Similarly, since the possibility that mis- classification may have been greater in the American Cancer Society study 39 because alcohol consumption was reported to acquaintances, we recalculated the RE summary after excluding those data. The ~3 coefficient was 0.0085 (SE = 0.0016). Finally, we recalculated the RE summary after including the data from the study by Zaridze et a156 (excluded because it was implausibly positive); the 13 coefficient was then 0.0083 (SE = 0.0015). We also note that in the studies excluded from the meta-analysis (Table 2), that an association be- tween alcohol and breast cancer was found in the majority. We recalculated the random effects summary after basing estimates of intake on category means instead of medians;/3 in this case was 0.0073 (SE = 0.0013). As noted elsewhere, 5 use of ad hoc methods to assign exposure scores to intake categories, as was done in the earlier meta-analysis, 1 would have given a slope greater than that obtained using category medians. Medians were used here because they are less in- fluenced by the assumption that risk increases linearly on the log scale at higher intakes. The better fit of the quadratic model (and the negative sign for the quadratic term) suggests this assumption did not hold. Qualitative literature review In nearly all the studies, the results were adjusted for established risk factors for breast cancer such as age at first birth. Similarly, socioeconomic status was con- sidered as a potentially confounding factor in 16 $tudiesT, lo-12,t6,28,32,34,35,39,41,4~ 45,47,48 and adjustment for this did not decrease the alcohol/breast-cancer association. In studies with dietary data, adjustment for dietary fac- tors did not diminish the association of alcohol with breast cancer. 9,1~ If an as yet unrecognized, con- founding factor accounted for the association of alcohol with breast cancer, this factor would have to be associated strongly with alcohol consumption and be a strong risk factor for breast cancer. As none of the known risk factors for breast cancer (other than age) are particularly strong, 59,6~ bias due to confounding seems an unlikely explanation for the association. Consumption of beer, wine, and spirits each have been implicated in at least several stud-ies. 8'9'11'I6'20,24,29,30,32,34,43-48 If results are considered only from positive studies in which comparisons among beverages were made after considering dose and intake of other beverages, 9,4s the results suggest that risk increases with consumption of alcohol in general, regardless of beverage type. The data in several studies suggests that alcohol con- sumption early in life has a particularly strong relation with subsequent risk of breast cancer. 8,11,27,28 However, a special effect of early drinking has not been found consistently.43,44. 49 The risk of breast cancer among those who have drunk longer has been found not to be elevated. 43,44 The relation of cumulative intake to risk, however, has not been examined in any study. Ferraroni et al ~8 expressed alcohol intake per kilogram of bodyweight and found this made no difference in their results. As alcohol is distributed into the total body water, 61 the results of Cancer Causes and Control. Vol 5. 1994 77 M. P. Longnecker other investigations that take this into account would be of interest. The association between alcohol and breast cancer was greater in younger women in two early studies; 9,~~ however, subsequent reports have not confirmed this. 32,34,43,47,48 In several studies, the association was greater in premenopausal women; ~~ however, in other studies the opposite was true 8,48 or there was no important difference by menopausal status. 43,47 A larger association among thin women, which had been iden- tified in two early studies, 9,1~ has either been supported weakly ~9,s4 or not supported by additional reports. 39,43,~7 Colditz and colleagues from the Nurses' Health Study 62 reported that an association between replace- ment estrogen use and increased risk of breast cancer occurred only in women who drank alcohol. In another report on this topic, also from a cohort study, the alcohol/breast cancer-association was evident only among users of replacement estrogen24 In data from a third cohort study, Freidenreich et at 53 (and Freidenreich, personal communication, 1993) did not find effect modification by replacement estrogen use. Other investigators may have examined this associ- ation and opted not to report their findings because notable effect modification was not present. One of the most perplexing observations in the meta-analysis was that the two follow-up studies by Schatzkin 1~ both showed extreme effects, but in opposite directions (Table 1). These two follow-up studies were among the least precise of all studies; thus, chance may account for the divergence. Plausible rea- sons for the inverse effect in the Framingham study, 31 other than chance, are hard to fathom. On the other hand, measurement of a true positive association in the Framingham study might have been attenuated because the follow-up was relatively long (up to 32 years). Although data are available fr01~ ecologic corre- lation studies of national breast-cancer rates in relation toper capita alcohol consumption,63 per capita alcohol consumption may not reflect intake by women. Simi- larly, cohort studies of alcoholics 64,65 are small, impre- cise, and intake among alcoholics is measured inaccurately. Therefore, data from both of these types of studies are much less informative than the analytical epidemiologic studies considered here, and little is gained by considering their contribution. One case- control study of risk factors for breast cancer in males found alcohol not to be a risk factor. 66 Discussion The meta-analysis showed strong evidence of a dose- response relation; the slope of the dose-response curve, 78 Cancer Causes and Control. Vol 5. 1994 however, was quite modest. The studies with stronger alcohol/breast cancer-associations tended to be from countries with high per capita alcohol intakes. While per capita alcohol intake reflects primarily the alcohol consumption of men, this variable may reflect a national pattern of drinking. For example, in western European countries where alcohol consumption is greatest, women may have begun drinking alcohol earlier in life or may have drunk more consistently throughout their lives than in countries whereper cap- ita intake is lower. The problem in interpreting this finding resembles that encountered in ecologic or international correlation studies; alternative expla- nations for the association are possible. The slope cal- culated from the results of US studies was 0.0076 (SE -- 0.0017) (compared with 0.0083 [SE = 0.0015] overall), i.e., the European studies did not drive the overall association. The dose-response relation in the present study is less strong than in a previous analysis, but this difference is due primarily to improved methods of analysis. 5 Another finding from the meta-analysis was that in the cohort studies with the longest follow-up period, the association between alcohol and breast cancer was less strong. With time, the baseline measure of intake may have carried less information about intake during a more etiologically relevant period. The qualitative literature review revealed that evi- dence for effect modification was not strong for any factor except perhaps estrogen replacement therapy, for which few observations are available. Rothman and Poole 67 have proposed that when weak effects are being examined they may be seen more plainly among those at low risk of the disease in question. Some investigators have examined the alcohol/breast cancer-association in women at low risk of breast cancer (defined by the level of several risk fac- tors, all present or not) and found that the association was stronger in women in the low risk group, 9,29 how- ever not all have found this2 ~ Alcohol might increase risk of breast cancer by mechanisms that are not organ-specific. 68 Among such mechanisms are increased hepatic metabolism of car- cinogens by ethanol-induced enzymes, immunologic effects, membrane effects, inhibition of DNA repair by acetaldehyde, congener effects, etc. However, evidence for mechanisms that relate specifically to breast cancer also exists. In a recent experiment in women, after three months of consuming about two drinks daily, peri- ovulatory serum-estrogen levels increased. 69 In a recent cross-sectional study among postmenopausal women, serum estrogen levels were associated with alcohol intake. 7~ However, the relation of serum estrogen to risk of breast cancer, while suspected, is not estab- lished. 7' In animal experiments, alcohol has been shown to enhance the development of mammary can- cer. ~2,73 While alcohol itself does not induce cancer in animal models, alcohol does alter the rate of prolifer- ation of cells in the mammary gland. 73 Increased cell division is thought to enhance the effect of cancer- causing agents. TMWhile the animal data are provocative, they are inconsistent ~s and their relevance to humans is unclear. One study on alcohol and benign prolifer- ative breast-disease in humans suggests there is no association. 76 Imperfect self-reports of alcohol use influence the observed slope of the dose-response relation between alcohol and breast cancer. Thus, the precise slope of the dose-response association is not clear. However, that the slope is positive is not at issue. If we consider the error in assessment of alcohol intake that has been mea- sured in one validation study, 9 this information can be used to deattenuate the slope of the dose-response be- tween alcohol and breast cancer. 77 Such correction increases the slope by about 50 percent. In other words, the true RR associated with two drinks daily may be closer to 1.38 than the observed estimate of 1.24. If the error in measurement of alcohol consumption is taken into account, 77 the proportion of all breast can- cers in the US attributable to alcohol consumption is about four percent (see Appendix II). Thus, alcohol consumption, if causal, accounts for only a small pro- portion of all cases of breast cancer. The proportion is small because US women, in general, do not drink much, and because the association between alcohol consumption and breast cancer risk is modest. Marked variation among study, results was present even after we accounted for the two effect modifiers that were identified (per capita alcohol intake and length of follow-up). Some might view this as evidence of an incomplete analysis; we submit that if a diligent effort to account for all heterogeneity fails, this itself is a notable finding. A traditional, scientifically conservative assessment of whether alcohol consumption causes breast cancer, 78 is as follows. Favoring causality is that (i) on average, the data support a dose-response relation, (ii) plausible biologic mechanisms have been identified, and (iii) the association appears not to be due to bias. Arguing against causality is that (i) even at heavy doses, the increase in risk in most studies is only moderate, leav- ing open the possibility that the association is due to confounding by an unknown factor, and (ii) the marked variation in the findings of studies, with some data showing no association. From this perspective, evidence for alcohol being a cause of breast cancer remains inconclusive. The requirement for causality that the observation be observed consistently is debatable. 79 The variation in study findings has four explanations: chance; biased study results; publication bias; and effect modification. The variation is greater than what would be expected due to chance alone. Variation in study quality (bias) has not explained the variation--though our ability to measure quality is limited. Publication bias could account for the heterogeneity. However, because the omitted studies, if any, were probably small, effect modification may well be the most likely explanation for the variation in results across studies, although the effect modifier(s) remains largely unidentified. If effect modification is present, this requires the presence of an effect. Assume that effect modification causes an association to be observed in some populations. In several such cases the association is sufficiently strong that confounding is an unlikely explanation; further, because the association has been demonstrated in good follow-up studies, this supports that the finding is not due to selection bias or information bias. From this perspective, the evidence for alcohol as a cause of breast cancer is becoming stronger. A wealth of epidemiologic data on alcohol and breast cancer already exists. Quite possibly the issue of causality will not be resolved by additional studies in the near future. Future studies are likely, however, to identify subgroups at high risk, or to determine if par- ticular drinking patterns or cumulative intake are especially associated with risk. We are unlikely to have substantially better basic data upon which to make a decision about causality for some time. Perhaps it is time to consider more seriously what should be done if alcohol does cause breast cancer. Before any recommendations are made to change alcohol consumption to reduce risk of breast cancer, a risk-benefit analysis is in order. While heavy alcohol consumption is clearly unhealthy, the effect of light and moderate alcohol consumption on overall mortality appears to be favorable in men and women. 39,s~ However, women who are at high risk of breast cancer and low risk of heart disease may benefit from stopping light or moderate alcohol consumption. A model is needed that can provide an estimate of the overall benefits and risks of light and moderate alcohol consumption for women with a given risk profile. N.B. We know of one study 82 that has appeared since we completed our literature review; in those data, a modest association between alcohol and breast cancer was evident. Acknowledgements--The author is grateful to Drs Walter C.

For example, log relative risks for categories of consumption with a median intake be- tween six and 19 g of alcohol daily (about one alcoholic drink daily) were combined across studies, using an inverse-variance weighted average and random effects models. By repeating application of this approach for other categories of alcohol consumption, a 'nonpara- metric' dose-response curve was obtained. The non- parametric dose-response curve was nearly identical to the parametric results presented. Thus, the model we assumed (linear response on a log scale) was an appro- priate summary of the shape of the dose-response curve. Appendix II. In calculating the population attributable risk, we made the following assumptions. Thirty-five percent of US women do not drink alcohol, 47 percent drink lightly (<6 g/day), 15 percent drink moderately (6-25 g/day), and three percent drink heavily (26 g/day or more)? 3 The median daily alcohol consumption (in g) in these categories is 0, 1.7, 11, and 28. 2 The increase in log relative risk of breast cancer per gram of alcohol consumed daily is 0.008 (see main paper). The measurement error-adjusted slope was estimated by dividing 0.008 by 0.672. zz,84 Standard population attributable risk calculations were then employed? 5 82 Cancer Causes and Control.
