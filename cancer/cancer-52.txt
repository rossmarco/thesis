ABSTRACT We hypothesized that the risk of colorectal cancer associated with meat preparation methods
producing heterocyclic amines or polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons is modiﬁed by the CYP1A1 genotype alone or
in combination with the GSTM1 genotype or the NAT2 imputed phenotype. A total of 952 rectal cancer cases and
1205 controls (between September 1997 and February 2002) and 1346 colon cancer cases and 1544 controls
(between October 1991 and September 1994) from Utah and Northern California were recruited from a population-
based case-control study. Detailed interviews ascertained lifestyle, medical history, and diet and we extracted DNA
from whole blood. Risk of colorectal cancer decreased among men with the CYP1A1 *2 any variant genotype and
the lowest intake of poultry and men and women with high use of white meat drippings. Risk increased among men
with the CYP1A1 *1 (no variant) allele and high white meat mutagen index, but decreased among those with the
CYP1A1 *2 genotype. Risk increased with a high white meat mutagen index among women with the CYP1A1 *2
genotype and the GSTM1 present genotype. Risk of colorectal cancer decreased with the CYP1A1 *2 genotype,
the NAT2 slow phenotype, and the use of white meat or its drippings. The association of risk for colorectal cancer
and selected red and white meat mutagen indices and the use of white meat drippings, or fried white meat variables
was more evident within select combinations of the CYP1A1 genotype and either the GSTM1 genotype or NAT2
than with the CYP1A1 alone. Genetic susceptibility may modify the associations of some meat or meat preparation
factors with the risk of colorectal cancer.

Heterocyclic amines (HCAs)3 are formed as a by-product of
reactions during the cooking of meat, especially when it is
well-done, char-broiled, or pan-fried (1–5). Dietary exposure
to HCAs has been a suspected risk factor for colorectal cancer
since the 1970s (6). Food is one of the primary sources of
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) exposure in the
United States, and grilled or barbecued meats contribute much
of the carcinogenic PAH in the diet (7). Inherited variation in
the metabolism of HCA and PAH compounds appears to be
responsible for between-individual variation in systemic expo-
sure and may modify cancer risk associated with these expo-
sures. Metabolism of certain PAH compounds to mutagenic

(8,9). However, other CYP enzymes,

forms is initiated by a cytochrome p-4501A1 (CYP1A1)-
catalyzed hydroxylation. Reactive intermediates can be detox-
iﬁed by the glutathione S-transferase M1 (GSTM1) enzyme.
We hypothesized that variants that increase CYP1A1 activity,
and the GSTM1 null variant, associated with no enzymatic
activity, are also associated with increased risk of cancers.
Initial N-hydroxylation of HCA compounds in liver is primar-
ily catalyzed by CYP1A2; to date, no known CYP1A2 genetic
variants explain the interindividual variation in CYP1A2 ac-
tivity
including
CYP1A1, are capable of some metabolism of HCA and are
expressed in extrahepatic tissues (10). Further, CYP1A en-
zymes are coordinately regulated and a CYP1A1 polymor-
phism may be correlated with a difference in CYP1A2 activity
(11). The N-acetyl transferase (NAT) enzymes catalyze the
next step of activation of HCAs, O-acetylation, to form com-
pounds that covalently bind to DNA. Therefore, we hypoth-
esized that CYP1A1 and the inherited low-activity NAT2
variants may be associated with decreased risk of colorectal
cancer (12).

We used genotype information from large, population-
based case-control studies of cancers of the colon (13) and
rectum (14) for our previous reports that a high index for
mutagen exposure from meat in diet was associated with an

increased risk of colon (15) and rectal cancer (16) in men. In
men, consumption of well-done meat was associated with an
increased risk for rectal cancer (16). There was no association
between mutagen index and colon or rectal cancer for women
(15,16). We found that the risk of colon cancer was not
associated with the NAT2 phenotype or the GSTM1 genotype
alone, but was modestly increased among those men with the
NAT2 intermediate or rapid type acetylator phenotype and
high processed meat consumption or high mutagen index
(15). Use of red meat drippings by women was associated
with a decreased risk of rectal cancer, and this decrease was
greater among women with the slow NAT2-imputed phe-
notype and the GSTM1 absent genotype (16). We previ-
ously reported that genotypes of phase II metabolizing en-
zymes
interacted with associations of meat and meat
preparation variables differentially by gender with risk for
colon (15) and rectal cancer (16).

Studies considering combinations of phase I and phase II
metabolizing enzymes might be necessary to determine sub-
stantial increases in risk (8,17,18). However, the variants in
the human CYP1A1 gene are infrequent in Caucasian popu-
lations, so studies of association with cancer have had little
power to detect an association (19 –22). In the present report,
we investigated whether polymorphisms in CYP1A1, indepen-
dently and in combination with GSTM1 genotype or NAT2
imputed phenotype, modify the association of meat consump-
tion and/or preparation with risk of colorectal cancer in men
and women from Utah and northern California. Speciﬁcally
we hypothesized that CYP1A1 variants increasing activity
would be independently associated with increased risk of colo-
rectal cancer. We hypothesized that those with the activity
increasing variants in CYP1A1 and GSTM1 null genotype
would be at increased risk of colorectal cancer and that those
with the fast/intermediate NAT2 imputed phenotype would be
at increased risk of colorectal cancer.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Participants. Cases with a ﬁrst primary tumor in the rectosig-
moid junction or rectum were identiﬁed between May 1997 and May
2001 using a rapid-reporting system (14). Cases with ﬁrst primary
colon cancer were identiﬁed between October 1991 and September
1994 (13). Case eligibility was determined in northern California by
the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results Cancer Registries and
in Utah using a rapid-reporting system. An on-line pathology report-
ing system was searched for rapid case ascertainment of rectal cancer
cases at Kaiser Permanente Northern California Cancer Registry
(KPMCP). Cases identiﬁed were conﬁrmed through linkage to the
KPMCP. Cases with a previous colorectal tumor were not eligible for
the study. Cases with known (as indicated on the pathology report)
familial adenomatous polyposis, ulcerative colitis, or Crohn’s disease
were not eligible. In addition to these criteria, participants were
between 30 and 79 y of age at the time of diagnosis, English speaking,
and mentally competent to complete the interview.

Controls were matched to cases by sex and by 5-year age groups.
At the KPMCP, controls were randomly selected from membership
lists, and in Utah controls 65 y and older were randomly selected from
social security lists and controls younger than 65 were randomly
selected from driver’s license lists. A total of 952 rectal cancer cases
and 1205 matched controls and 1346 colon cancer cases and 1544
matched controls are included in the analyses presented. Response
rates for the rectal study were 65.2% for cases and 65.3% for controls;
cooperation rates, or the number of people who participated from
those who we were able to contact, were 73.2% for cases and 68.8%
for controls. For the colon cancer study response rates were 71.8% for
cases and 68.0% for controls.

Data collection. Data were collected by trained and certiﬁed
interviewers using laptop computers. The interview took approxi-
mately 2 h. Quality control methods used in the rectal cancer study

Diet. We obtained dietary intake using an adaptation of the
Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults diet history
(24 –26). Participants were asked to recall foods eaten for the calen-
dar year occurring 2 y before their cancer diagnosis (cases) or recruit-
ment into the study (controls), the frequency that they were eaten,
serving size, and whether fats were added in the preparation. Food
intake data were converted to nutrient data using the Minnesota
Nutrition Coordinating Center nutrient database Version 4.02_30.
Additional information was gathered on usual doneness of red meats
(rare, medium rare, medium well done, and well done). Participants
were asked how frequently they fried, broiled, baked, or barbequed
(cooked at high temperatures) and how frequently drippings were
used in other foods or gravies. Variables included servings of partic-
ular foods or food groups (i.e., red meat, poultry, red meat drippings)
consumed per day, week, or year. The mutagen index was calculated
as the frequency of red meat, poultry, and ﬁsh consumption prepared
by frying, broiling, baking, or barbecuing plus the use of drippings
from red meat, poultry, or ﬁsh, multiplied by the usual doneness of red
meat, poultry, and ﬁsh (1 ⫽ rare, 2 ⫽ medium rare, 3 ⫽ medium well,
and 4 ⫽ well done) and the microwave factor (1 ⫽ microwave never
used or used for thawing, 0.75 ⫽ sometimes used, 0.50 ⫽ often used,
0.25 ⫽ always used) (15). A higher index reﬂects higher intake of
potentially mutagenic compounds.

Genetic data. DNA was extracted from whole blood. The
CYP1A1 thymine (T) ⬎ cytosine (C) (*2A allele) transition in the
3⬘-untranslated region was detected using the PCR method described
by Hayashi et al. (27), in which the 343 basepair (bp) PCR product
was digested with MspI. The common allele (T) is uncut and is ⬃340
bp in length. The C allele is digested and leads to 2 smaller bands of
200 and 140 bp. The CYP1A1 A4889G (Ile462Val, *2B allele) was
detected using allele-speciﬁc PCR and was performed with one up-
stream primer and 2 downstream primers as described by Rebbeck et
al. (28) with the following modiﬁcations. The downstream primer
speciﬁc for the uncommon allele guanine (G) was modiﬁed with a
GC clamp to increase the melting temperature (CGCCCGCCGC-
CGCCCGCCGCGTGTATCGGTGAGACCG); the downstream
primer speciﬁc for the common allele adenine (A) is the same as in
Rebbeck et al. (28) (GAAGTGTATCGGTGAGACCA). The
common upstream primer used was (TTCCACCCGTTGCAG-
CAGGATAGCC) (29). PCR was performed and analyzed using the
iCycler iQ real-time detection system. PCR conditions were 35 cycles
of 15 s each at 95, 61, and 72°C. This was followed by 10 s at 95°C
and then by 80 cycles of half degree decrements for 10 s for analysis
of melting temperature. The melting temperature of the common
allele was 85.5°C, whereas the melting temperature of the uncommon
(G) allele, due to the GC clamp, was 90.5°C. This assay utilizes Sybr
green dye and the 2.3 version of the software. Any genotype with a
G allele was veriﬁed by PCR ampliﬁcation with the following primers:
CTGTCTCCCTCTGGTTACAGGAAG (29) and GGCACGC
TGAATTCCAC GCAATGCAGC AGGATAGC, which was
then followed by BsrDI restriction digestion. PCR conditions for this
reaction were the same as for the above iCycler reaction except that
30 cycles were performed. The uncut product is 215 bp in length. The
G allele leads to loss of the restriction site and a 192-bp band due to
digestion of the control BsrDI site. Amplicons with the A allele are
further digested to 149/43 bp.

The GSTM1 null genotype was detected using the PCR method
described by Zhong et al. (30). To determine acetylator status we
assessed the presence of the *5, *6, or *7 alleles of NAT2, using the
method of Bell et al. (31). These 3 variants account for ⬃90 to 95%
of the slow acetylation phenotype in Caucasians. All 3 variants could
be identiﬁed from 1 PCR product that is digested with 3 different
restriction enzymes. The C481T variant (*5 allele) was determined
using a KpnI digest; the G590A variant (*6 allele) using a TaqI digest;
and the G857A variant (*7 allele) using a Bam HI digest. Because
genotype, not phenotype, is measured, we deﬁne imputed phenotype
as follows: those carrying two *5, *6, or *7 variant alleles were
classiﬁed as slow acetylators; those with 1 or 0 of these alleles were
classiﬁed as rapid/intermediate acetylators. Detailed descriptions of
the methods have been previously reported (15,16,32).

Height and weight were measured at the time of interview. The
BMI (kg/m2) was calculated for men and women. Weight was also
reported for the 2 and 5 y prior to interview. Physical activity data
were collected using a physical activity questionnaire that has been
described elsewhere (33). All procedures were approved by the Uni-
versity of Utah Institution Review Board.

Statistical methods. Descriptive statistics of continuous variables
are presented as means ⫾ SD with comparisons made by Students t
test. Descriptive statistics for categorical variables are presented as
percentages and comparisons are made using chi-square tests. Differ-
ences were considered signiﬁcant at P ⬍ 0.05. Unconditional logistic
regression models were used to estimate risk (odds ratios, 95% CI) of
colon and rectal cancer and dietary meat consumption and meat
preparation methods. Associations were explored in men and women
separately based on previous gender-speciﬁc ﬁndings (15,16). Asso-
ciations with the mutagen index were similar for colon and rectal
cancer; therefore, to increase power we pooled colon and rectal
cancer cases by gender for further analysis.

We assessed dietary data by determining risk across medians,
thirds, or quartiles of intake or cutoffs used for previous papers (15)
depending on the distribution of the data. The medians, thirds, or
quartiles were determined by the sex-speciﬁc intake distribution in
the control population. In these models the following variables were
included: age at selection, BMI, physical activity, energy intake,
dietary ﬁber, dietary calcium, and cigarette smoking status. To eval-
uate the potential inﬂuence of ethnicity on results, analyses were
repeated in Caucasians only. Odds ratios and interpretation of the
data were not substantially different, although statistical signiﬁcance
(P ⬍ 0.05) and CI were inﬂuenced by the smaller cell sizes. Results

are reported for all race/ethnicities without race/ethnicity as a covari-
ate.

Linear trend was determined by evaluating the signiﬁcance of
linear association across the categorized variable. We assessed the
CYP1A1 as no variant (*1 neither variant) or any *2 variant (het-
erozygous/variant) of the MspI or Ill462Val polymorphisms. The
GSTM1 was assessed as present or absent and the NAT2 was analyzed
as slow or rapid/intermediate imputed phenotype. Interaction, or
effect modiﬁcation, between meat-related variables and the CYP1A1
alone and with the GSTM1 or NAT2 genotype was evaluated as the
excess risk on both additive (34) and multiplicative scales with trend
variables.

RESULTS

Participants in the colon cancer study were between 64 and
65 y of age, whereas participants in the rectal cancer study
were between 61 and 62 y of age. The majority of participants
were non-Hispanic white (Table 1). Men and women with
colon cancer consumed more fat and a higher percentage of
energy from fat than their gender-matched controls. Men and
women with colon and rectal cancer consumed more choles-
terol than controls. Men with rectal cancer consumed more
animal protein than male controls. Men with colon or rectal
cancer and women with rectal cancer consumed more red and
processed meats than their gender-matched controls.

Seventy-six percent of controls were homozygous for the
CYP1A1 wild type (*1 allele). There was no interaction

among red meat consumption, use of red meat cooked at high
temperatures or use of red meat drippings, use of well-done red
meat, or red meat mutagen index and CYP1A1 genotype. The
association of colorectal cancer and poultry consumption ap-
peared to be modiﬁed by the CYP1A1 genotype in men; risk
was constant across the range of poultry intake in men with
the CYP1A1 no variant genotypes and increased across the
range of poultry intake in men with any *2 variant (any
variant of MspI or Ill462Val) of the CYP1A1 genotypes (Table
2). The association of colorectal cancer with white meat
drippings appeared to be modiﬁed by CYP1A1 genotype in
both men and women. In men and women with the CYP1A1
no variant alleles (*1), use of white meat drippings was asso-
ciated with no change in risk, but in men with any *2 variant
of the CYP1A1 genotypes, risk decreased with use of white
meat drippings. In women with any *2 variant alleles of the
CYP1A1 genotypes risk of colorectal cancer increased with use
of white meat drippings 1–36 times per year, but decreased
with more frequent use. Risk of colorectal cancer increased

among women with any *2 variant alleles of the CYP1A1
genotypes and a low white meat mutagen index. The risks of
colorectal cancer associated with CYP1A1 genotype and meat
consumption and preparation were not modiﬁed by age or
estrogen status (data not shown).

The association of red meat consumption with risk for
colorectal cancer was not signiﬁcantly modiﬁed by the com-
bination of CYP1A1 genotypes and GSTM1 genotype (Table
3). Risk of colorectal cancer increased with preference for
well-done red meat among men, but did not differ between
wild and any *2 variant CYP1A1 genotypes. There was a
signiﬁcant interaction among use of white meat drippings,
CYP1A1 genotypes, and risk of colorectal cancer in men.
There was a decreased risk of colorectal cancer associated with
the highest use of white meat drippings in men who had the
CYP1A1 any *2 variant genotype and the GSTM1 present
genotype. The interaction of white meat mutagen index,
CYP1A1 genotype, and GSTM1 genotype indicated an in-
crease in risk among men with a high white meat mutagen

index and any combination of CYP1A1 genotypes and
GSTM1 genotype except any CYP1A1 variant genotypes and
the GSTM1 present genotype where risk was neither elevated
nor decreased. In women, there was a nearly 2-fold increase
with a high red meat mutagen index, with any CYP1A1
variant and GSTM1 present genotypes (OR 1.98, 95% CI
1.06, 3.67).

We found increased risk associated with low white meat
mutagen index and CYP1A1 variant genotype among women
who had the GSTM1 present genotype.

The combination of CYP1A1 genotype and NAT2 imputed
phenotype modiﬁed the association of white meat consump-
tion and use of white meat drippings with risk for colorectal
cancer. Men with the highest consumption of white meat, the
CYP1A1 wild-type genotypes, and the NAT2 slow imputed
phenotype had an increased risk of colorectal cancer (OR
1.40, 95% CI 1.01, 1.95, Table 4). The risk for colorectal
cancer decreased (OR 0.61, 95% CI 0.14, 1.03) among men
with the most frequent use of white meat drippings and the
CYP1A1 variant genotype and the NAT2 rapid imputed phe-
notype. The increased risk associated with a high white meat
mutagen index and CYP1A1 wild genotype occurred primarily
among those men who also had the NAT2 rapid imputed
phenotype (P for multiplicative interaction ⬍ 0.02). An in-
creased risk was also associated with a low white meat mutagen
index in women with the CYP1A1 variant genotype and the
NAT2 slow imputed phenotype, although neither the odds
ratio (OR 1.47, 95%CI 0.88, 2.46) nor the interaction was
signiﬁcant (P ⬎ 0.14).

DISCUSSION

We hypothesized that the risk of colorectal cancer would
increase with consumption of meats cooked at high tempera-
tures and the CYP1A1 22 MspI or Ill462Val polymorphisms.

We detected a decrease in risk of colorectal cancer with any *2
variant alleles of CYP1A1 and white meat drippings in men
and women. Examination of any *2 variant alleles of CYP1A1
with polymorphisms
in phase II metabolizing enzymes
(GSTM1 genotype and NAT2 imputed phenotype) associa-
tions were not always in the direction hypothesized. Previous
studies have found both that NAT2 fast acetylators are not at
greater risk for colorectal cancer when exposed to high levels
of well-cooked meat (35) and that risks associated with con-
sumption of processed meats and a high mutagen index were
strongest with those with the intermediate or fast NAT2
acetylator genotype (15). Characterization of multiple poly-
morphisms in phase I and phase II metabolizing enzymes may
be needed before substantial increases in risk of colorectal
cancer are identiﬁable, even with high exposure to dietary
sources of mutagens.

CYP1A1 plays a role in activation of PAHs and HCAs;
therefore we hypothesized a greater risk of colorectal cancer
with CYP1A1 variants tending to increase enzymatic activity
and greater intake of meats, especially well-done meats or
those cooked at high temperatures. Although red meat is a
suspected risk factor for colorectal cancer (36), and we previ-
ously found a positive association of red meat with colon
cancer (P ⬎ 0.05) and red meat doneness (P ⫽ 0.04) with the
risk of rectal cancer (16) among men, we found that the more
consistent associations detected in this study were with white
meat and white meat drippings. The association of white meat
to colorectal cancer is not consistent, with reports that white
meat is both a signiﬁcant risk factor for colon cancer in men
and women (37) when analyzed separately (15) and associated
with a decreased risk of colorectal adenomas (38). Levels of
HCAs in beef and chicken did not differ (39). Cooking
methods also affects levels of HCA, and a recent report sug-
gested that baked versus pan-fried red and white meats have

different relations to colorectal cancer (40). In the present
study, we asked about the frequency of consumption of baked,
broiled, and fried red and white meats, leaving the possibility
that the associations with fried red meat could be masked by
pooling with baked and broiled meats. We observed an in-
creased risk among men with the CYP1A1 wild type and a
high white meat mutagen index instead of with the variant
genotype, suggesting that activation of HCA by the CYP1A1
variant is not a critical determinant of colorectal cancer risk.
Nonetheless, an increase in DNA adducts from normal mu-
cosa has been reported to be associated with consumption of
white meat in men (41), supporting a role for white meat in
colorectal carcinogenesis. Whether these unexpected results
stem from differences in other aspects of diet that we did not
account for or whether the inﬂuence of the single genotype, in
the context of the complexity of carcinogen metabolism, is not
strong enough for detection is yet unknown.

Whereas CYP1A1 is involved in metabolism of both HCAs
and PAHs, NAT2 plays a role in both detoxiﬁcation and
activation of HCAs, and GSTM1 is involved in the detoxiﬁ-
cation of PCAs. We also found an increased risk of colon, but
not rectal cancer among individuals with at least one variant
allele of the CYP1A1 genotypes examined, GSTM1, null, and
the NAT2-imputed phenotype (17). These ﬁndings support
the notion that modiﬁcation in risk of colon cancer may be
more evident when phase II metabolizing enzymes are exam-
ined in combination with CYP1A1 genotype (17,20,22,35,42–

44). Whereas a Japanese study reported no univariate associ-
ation of CYP1A1 MSP1 or GSTM1 null genotype to colorectal
adenomas in smokers (42), examination of multiple phase I
and phase II metabolizing enzymes previously suggested that
individuals with multiple polymorphisms were at nearly5-fold
greater risk of colorectal cancer (20). Although NAT2 alone
has generally not been reported to be associated with risk of
colon (45), rectal, (32) or colorectal cancer (40,46,47), 2
studies reported an increase in risk of colorectal cancer in
individuals with both the CYP1A2 rapid phenotype and the
NAT2 rapid phenotype (35,43).

We previously reported that the associations of rectal can-
cer, NAT2, and GSTM1 with meat and meat preparation were
not always in the hypothesized direction (16). However, al-
though it is generally thought that risks would increase with
the NAT2 rapid phenotype, the role of NAT2 in both acti-
vation and detoxiﬁcation of HCAs (8,44) makes ﬁndings with
both slow and rapid phenotypes believable. In women, we
found no association of CYP1A1 polymorphisms alone,
GSTM1 polymorphisms alone, or red meat mutagen alone
with colon (15)and rectal cancer (16), but we did ﬁnd a
positive association with the CYP1A1 *2 genotype, the
GSTM1 present genotype, and the red meat mutagen index.
Previous ﬁndings include inverse associations of poultry and
ﬁsh with colorectal cancer among those with GSTM1 pheno-
types, which was attributed to confounding of other healthy
habits (47). Lin and colleagues described a lower risk of

colorectal adenomas among GSTM1 absent genotypes with
high broccoli intake, presumably due to higher isothiocyanate
levels (48). Therefore, it is difﬁcult to discern which associa-
tions might be spurious and which might appropriately reﬂect
activation or detoxiﬁcation activities.

We did not directly measure heterocyclic amines and poly-
cyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, but inferred their intake by
asking questions about preference for doneness of meat and
preparation method. Strengths of the study include rigorous
quality control procedures (23) and in-depth dietary assess-
ment that included detailed meat preparation questions (24 –
26). Gender differences in association are difﬁcult to reconcile;
however, few studies have reported gender-speciﬁc interac-
tions of gene environment associations, likely due to sample
size issues. Biological plausibility of gender differences is sup-
ported by reports that estrogen may stimulate manganese and
superoxide dismutase (antioxidants), inﬂuence gastrointestinal
motility in pregnancy (49), protect against microsatellite in-
stability in colorectal cancer (50), and be associated with
increased risk of Crohn’s disease (51). We cannot rule out the
possibility of recall bias for information recalled for up to 2 y
prior to cancer diagnosis or case selection. It is possible that
the time frame of measurements of exposure (diet and lifestyle)
does not coincide with the pathological process and, if so,
meaningful associations may be missed. Random measurement
error and misclassiﬁcation in measurement of diet, as well as
lifestyle factors, generally results in attenuation of associations
whereas multiple comparisons increase the likelihood of spu-
rious ﬁndings. Given the unexpected directions of some of the
ﬁndings, the possibility that one or more of the reported
associations might be spurious should be the subject of further
research.

These data suggest a modest decrease in the risk of colo-
rectal cancer among individuals who have the CYP1A1 any *2
variant genotype and consume white meat prepared at high
temperatures or white meat drippings. Risk increased among
women with a high red meat mutagen index, CYP1A1 any *2
variant genotype, and the GSTM1 present genotype. Associ-
ations of white meat mutagen index and white meat dripping
use with risk of colorectal cancer was more evident within
select subgroups of individuals with the CYP1A1 any *2 vari-
ant genotype combined with one of the GSTM1 present
genotype or the intermediate/rapid NAT2 imputed phenotype
than with CYP1A1 alone. Genetic susceptibility conferred by
polymorphisms in CYP1A1 alone and in combination with
NAT2 intermediate/rapid imputed phenotype and GSTM1
present genotype may modify the association of meat and meat
preparation variables with risk for colorectal cancer.
