Red Meat Consumption and Risk of Stroke in

Swedish Women

Susanna C. Larsson, PhD; Jarmo Virtamo, MD; Alicja Wolk, DMSc

Background and Purpose—High red meat consumption has been associated with increased risk of some cancers and may
also be a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. However, epidemiological studies of red meat consumption in relation
to risk of stroke are very limited. Our objective was to examine the association between red meat consumption and
stroke incidence in the Swedish Mammography Cohort.

Methods—We prospectively followed 34 670 women without cardiovascular disease and cancer at baseline. Participants
completed a self-administered questionnaire on diet and other risk factors for cardiovascular diseases in 1997. Cox
proportional hazards models were used to estimate multivariable-adjusted relative risks (RR) and 95% CI.

Results—During a mean follow-up of 10.4 years, we ascertained 1680 incident cases of stroke, comprising 1310 cerebral
infarction, 154 intracerebral hemorrhage, 79 subarachnoid hemorrhage, and 137 unspecified stroke. Total red meat and
processed meat consumption was associated with a statistically significant increased risk of cerebral infarction, but not
of total stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, or subarachnoid hemorrhage. The multivariable RR of cerebral infarction for
the highest versus the lowest quintile of consumption were 1.22 (95% CI, 1.01–1.46) for red meat and 1.24 (95% CI,
1.04 –1.49) for processed meat. Fresh (unprocessed) meat consumption was not associated with total stroke or with any
stroke subtype.

Conclusion—Findings from this study suggest that red and processed meat consumption may increase the risk of cerebral

infarction in women. (Stroke. 2011;42:324-329.)

High consumption of red meat and/or processed meat has

been associated with increased risk of some cancers1–3
and may also be a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases.3,4
Red meat is a source of saturated fat, cholesterol, and heme
iron and has been positively associated with blood pressure5
and with incidence of hypertension,6,7 the metabolic syn-
drome, and inflammation.8 A recent meta-analysis found that
processed meat consumption was associated with increased
risk of coronary heart disease and type 2 diabetes.4 To date,
only 3 studies have examined red meat consumption in
relation to stroke incidence or mortality, with a positive
association observed in 1 study,9 but not observed in the other
2 studies.10,11

Given the paucity of epidemiological data on red meat
consumption in relation to incidence of stroke, we examined
this association in the Swedish Mammography Cohort, a
population-based prospective cohort of Swedish women.

Methods

Study Population
Details of the Swedish Mammography Cohort have been reported
elsewhere.12 Briefly, the cohort was established between 1987

and 1990, when all women born between 1914 and 1948 who
were living in central Sweden (Va¨stmanland and Uppsala coun-
ties) were mailed questionnaire on diet. In the autumn of 1997,
the 56 030 participants who were still alive and resided in the
study area received a new expanded questionnaire that included
⬇350 items concerning diet and other lifestyle factors; 39 227
women (70%) completed the 1997 questionnaire. Because data on
several potential confounders (eg, smoking, diabetes, hyperten-
sion, and physical activity) were obtained for the first time in
1997, only women who completed the 1997 questionnaire were
included in the present study. We excluded women with an
erroneous or missing national identification number; those with a
history of stroke, coronary heart disease, or cancer before
beginning of follow-up; and those with implausible values for
total energy intake (ie, 3 SDs from the log-transformed mean
energy intake in the cohort). This left 34 670 women age 49 to 83
years for analysis. The study was approved by the Regional
Ethical Review Board at the Karolinska Institutet (Stockholm,
Sweden).

Baseline Data Collection
The 1997 questionnaire included questions on education, weight,
height, cigarette smoking, physical activity, aspirin use, medical
history, family history of myocardial infarction before 60 years,
alcohol consumption, and diet. Body mass index was calculated
by dividing weight in kilograms by the square of height in meters.

*All values are means if not otherwise indicated.
MET, indicates metabolic equivalent of energy expenditure (kcal/kg⫻h).

Pack-years of smoking history were calculated by number of
packs of cigarettes smoked per day multiplied by number of years
smoking. The participants reported their level of activity at work,
home/housework, walking/bicycling, and exercise in the year
before study enrollment. The questionnaire also included ques-
tions on inactivity (watching television/reading) and hours per
day of sleeping and sitting/lying down. The reported time spent at
each activity per day was multiplied by its typical energy
expenditure requirements expressed in metabolic equivalents and
added together to create a metabolic-equivalent hours per day
(24-hour) score.13

Dietary Assessment
Diet was assessed with a 96-item food-frequency questionnaire.
Participants were asked to indicate how often, on average, they
had consumed various foods over the previous year, with 8
predefined frequency categories ranging from “never” to “3 or
more times per day.” For this study, we grouped meats into red
meat, fresh meat, and processed meat. Fresh meat intake was
calculated using frequency of consumption and portion size
information of all types of fresh and minced pork, beef, and veal.
Processed meats included sausages, hot dog, salami, ham, pro-
cessed meat cuts, liver pate´, and blood sausage. Red meat was the
sum of fresh meat and processed meat. Participants were also
questioned about chicken/other poultry consumption.

Case Ascertainment and Follow-Up
Incident cases of first stroke that occurred between January 1, 1998
and December 31, 2008 were ascertained by linkage of the study
cohort with the Swedish Hospital Discharge Registry, which pro-
vides virtually complete coverage of discharges. The International
Classification of Diseases 10th revision (ICD-10) was used to
identify stroke events. Strokes were classified as cerebral infarction
(ICD-10 code I63), intracerebral hemorrhage (I61), subarachnoid
hemorrhage (I60), and unspecified stroke (I64). Data on dates of
death were obtained from the Swedish Death Registry.

Statistical Analysis
Each participant accrued follow-up time from January 1, 1998, until
the date of the first stroke event: death or December 31, 2008,

whichever came first. We used Cox proportional hazard models with
age as the time scale to estimate relative risks (RR) with 95% CI of
stroke by quintiles of red meat consumption. Entry time was defined
as a subject’s age in months at start of follow-up, and exit time was
defined as a subject’s age in months at stroke diagnosis or censoring.
The proportional hazards assumption was tested and was met for all
variables except diabetes. We adjusted for diabetes by stratification
in the Cox model. The multivariable model included the following
variables: smoking status and pack-years of smoking (never; past:
⬍20, 20 –39, or ⱖ40 pack-years; or current: ⬍20, 20 –39, or ⱖ40
pack-years), education (less than high school, high school, or
university), body mass index (⬍20, 20 –24.9, 25–29.9, or ⱖ30
kg/m2), total physical activity (by quartiles), self-reported history of
hypertension (yes or no), aspirin use (yes or no), family history of
myocardial infarction before 60 years of age (yes or no), and intakes
of total energy (kcal/d, as a continuous variable), alcohol (nondrink-
ers,⬍3.4, 3.4 –9.9, or ⱖ10.0 g/d), coffee (⬍1, 1–2, 3– 4, or ⱖ5
cups/d), fish (5 categories), fruit (by quartiles), and vegetables (by
quartiles).

Tests for linear trends across quintiles were conducted by model-
ing red meat consumption as a continuous variable in the model with
the median value of each quintile. We conducted analyses stratified
by age (⬍70 or ⱖ70 years), history of hypertension (yes or no),
smoking (never or ever), body mass index (⬍25 kg/m2 or ⱖ25
kg/m2), and history of diabetes (yes or no) to assess possible effect
modification by these variables. Tests for interaction were performed
using the log likelihood ratio test. Statistical analyses were per-
formed using SAS version 9.1 (SAS Institute Inc.). All probability
values were 2 sided.

Results

During a mean follow-up of 10.4 years, we ascertained
1680 incident strokes, comprising 1310 cerebral infarction,
154 intracerebral hemorrhage, 79 subarachnoid hemor-
rhage, and 137 unspecified stroke. There was ⬎5-fold
difference in mean red meat consumption between the
highest and lowest quintile (Table 1). In general, women in
the highest quintile of red meat consumption were younger
and less likely to have a university education, but were

more likely to have diabetes and a history of hypertension
compared with those in the lowest quintile. Women who
reported high red meat consumption also had higher body
mass index and higher intakes of energy, alcohol, coffee,
fish, fruits, and vegetables.

Red meat consumption was positively associated in a
statistically significant way with risk of cerebral infarction,
but not with total stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, or sub-
arachnoid hemorrhage (Table 2). Compared with women in
the lowest quintile of red meat consumption, the multivari-
able RR of cerebral infarction for women in the highest
quintile was 1.22 (95% CI, 1.01–1.46). Additional adjustment
for intakes of whole grains and dairy foods did not change
results appreciably (highest versus lowest quintile: RR⫽1.23;
95% CI 1.02–1.48). The association between red meat con-
sumption and cerebral
infarction was stronger when we
excluded the first 3 years of follow-up (RR⫽1.35; 95% CI,
1.10 –1.66; P⫽0.005).

When we stratified the analysis by smoking status, red
meat consumption was positively associated with risk of
cerebral infarction among never-smokers (highest versus
lowest quintile: RR⫽1.37; 95% CI, 1.08 –1.79), but not
among ever-smokers (corresponding RR⫽1.07; 95% CI,
0.79 –1.44); a test for interaction was not statistically
significant (P⫽0.16). Likewise, red meat consumption was
positively associated with risk of cerebral
infarction
among women without diabetes (RR⫽1.25; 95% CI, 1.03–
1.52), but not among women with diabetes (RR⫽0.88;
95% CI, 0.44 –1.78), although a test for interaction was not
statistically significant (P⫽0.21). There was a clear dose-
response relationship between red meat consumption and
risk of cerebral infarction among never-smokers without
diabetes (n⫽17 659); the multivariable RRs across quin-

tiles of red meat consumption were 1.00 (reference), 1.27
(95% CI, 1.02–1.57), 1.22 (95% CI, 0.97–1.53), 1.32 (95%
CI, 1.03–1.69), and 1.43 (95% CI, 1.11–1.83) (P⫽0.007).
The association between red meat consumption and stroke
was not modified by age or by hypertension.

To examine more extreme levels of red meat consumption,
we categorized participants into deciles of red meat consump-
tion. Compared with women in the lowest decile of red meat
(⬍25 g/d, mean 15.7 g/d), the multivariable RR of cerebral
infarction for those in the highest decile (ⱖ102 g/d, mean
150.7 g/d) was 1.42 (95% CI, 1.11–1.81). Among never-
smokers without diabetes, the corresponding RR was 1.68
(95% CI, 1.21–2.34).

Consumption of processed meat, but not of fresh meat, was
associated with an increased risk of cerebral
infarction;
however, there was no dose-response relationship (Table 3).
Risk of cerebral infarction was 10% to 28% higher among
women in the highest 4 quintiles of processed meat consump-
tion compared with those in the lowest quintile. We found no
significant associations between fresh meat or processed meat
consumption and risk of intracerebral hemorrhage or sub-
arachnoid hemorrhage (Table 3). Poultry consumption was
not associated with risk of total stroke or of any subtype, but
consumption of poultry in this population was very low
(median 0.5 servings/week).

Discussion

In this prospective cohort of Swedish women, consumption of
red meat and processed meat was associated with an in-
creased risk of cerebral infarction but not of total stroke,
intracerebral hemorrhage, or subarachnoid hemorrhage.
Women who consumed 102 g or more of red meat per day
(highest decile) had a 42% higher risk of cerebral infarction

compared with those who consumed less than 25 g/d (lowest
decile). Among never-smokers without diabetes, those in the
highest decile of red meat consumption had 68% increased
risk of cerebral infarction.

To our knowledge, only 3 previous studies have assessed
the association between red meat consumption and stroke. In
the Nurses’ Health Study, women who consumed ⱖ1 serving
of red and processed meats per day had an RR of ischemic
stroke of 1.86 (95% CI, 0.90 –3.83; P⫽0.005).9 Red meat
consumption was not associated with incidence of ischemic
or hemorrhagic stroke in the Health Professional Follow-up
Study10 or with total stroke mortality in a cohort of Japanese
men and women.11

There are several potential mechanisms whereby red
meat consumption may increase the risk of stroke. Hyper-
tension is the most important risk factor for stroke. In a
prospective study of 28 766 US women,
the risk of
incident hypertension rose with increasing baseline total
red meat consumption.7 Women who consumed 1.5 serv-
ings/d or more of red meat had a statistically significant,
35% higher risk of developing hypertension compared

with those who consumed no red meat. Similarly, in a
cohort of 4304 women and men, red and processed meat
consumption was positively associated with risk of ele-
vated blood pressure.6 Moreover, mean blood concentra-
tions of total cholesterol,
low-density lipoprotein cho-
lesterol, very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and
triglycerides were decreased in persons who substituted
red meat with fish.14,15

Red meat is a major source of bioavailable heme iron.
Iron is a redox-active transitional metal that can catalyze
the formation of hydroxyl radicals, which are powerful
pro-oxidants. Vascular inflammation and monocyte re-
cruitment are initiating events in atherosclerosis that have
been suggested to be caused partly by iron-mediated
oxidative stress. An experimental study showed that the
intracellular iron chelator desferrioxamine inhibited in-
flammation and atherosclerosis in mice, suggesting that
iron may play a role in atherogenesis.16 Elevated iron
stores may impose oxidative injury and have been associ-
ated with inflammation,17,18
the
metabolic syndrome,21 and type 2 diabetes.22 Red meat is

insulin resistance,19,20

also a source of saturated fat and cholesterol. Whether
saturated fat affects markers of vascular function, insulin
resistance, inflammation, or risk of stroke is unclear.23
Dietary cholesterol was not associated with risk of stroke
in 2 prospective studies.24

In this study, processed meat was positively associated
more strongly with risk of cerebral infarction than was
fresh meat. Sodium in processed meats could plausibly
account, in part, for these findings. A reduction in dietary
sodium intake has been shown to decrease significantly
blood pressure in hypertensive individuals.25 A low-
sodium diet has also been found to decrease oxidative
stress and to improve vascular function in salt-sensitive
individuals,26 and a high sodium intake may promote
vascular stiffness.27 Several prospective studies have ob-
served a positive association between processed meat
consumption and risk of type 2 diabetes,4,28,29 which is a
risk factor for cerebral infarction.

Strengths of

this study include its prospective and
population-based design and nearly complete follow-up of
study participants by linkage with population-based Swed-
ish registers. Although our study was much larger with
regard to the number of incident stroke cases compared
with previous studies, the number of cases of intracerebral
infarction and subarachnoid hemorrhage was still rela-
tively small; this leads to limited statistical power and
unstable risk estimates. Because diet was assessed using a
self-administered questionnaire, some measurement error
in assessing meat consumption was inevitable. Given the
prospective design, any measurement errors are likely to
be nondifferential and would have tended to attenuate the
association between red meat consumption and risk of
cerebral infarction. Another limitation is that our assess-
ment of medical history and other covariates was based on
self-report. It is possible that women with high consump-
tion of
increased risk of cerebral
infarction because of other unhealthy habits and behaviors.
However, our findings persisted after adjustment for a
wide variety of potential confounders,
including other
dietary factors. Women with high red meat consumption
reported higher consumption of fish, fruits, and vegetables,
which have been inversely associated with risk of
stroke.30,31 Thus, any residual confounding because of
imprecise measurement of those food items would tend to
attenuate rather than exaggerate the observed positive
association between red meat consumption and stroke.
Moreover, results persisted and were even stronger among
never-smokers and women without diabetes.

red meat were at

In conclusion, results from this prospective study of
women suggest that consumption of red and processed
meats may increase risk of cerebral
infarction. These
findings merit confirmation in additional large prospective
studies and in experimental studies on possible biological
mechanisms.
