Summary

The relation between cancer and metabolic disorders was recognized several
decades ago, but the underlying mechanisms involved in cancer development
and progression remain obscure. In the last years, many groups have been
studying systemic adipose tissue markers in cancer patients. However, few con-
sistent results were obtained. On the other hand, several studies revealed
many aspects of adipose tissue physiology in obesity. Nowadays,
is
recognized that excessive lipid uptake in adipocytes leads to hypertrophy and
consequently to metabolic dysregulation, hypoxia,
impaired
adipocytokine expression and angiogenesis, insulin resistance and macrophage
recruitment. In obese patients, tumours commonly colocalize with excessive
adipose tissue accumulation, and most of the features of hypertrophic adipose
tissue are observed in cancer patients, namely breast and colon. This
review aimed to summarize pathological adipose tissue alterations that may
contribute to cancer aetiology and development. Copyright © 2013 John Wiley

Epidemiology

The link between metabolic disorders and cancer was
proposed more than 80 years ago and is still under intense
investigation. The prevalence of obesity is rapidly increasing
worldwide; 71% of US men and 62% of US women are
overweight or obese. In Europe, metabolic syndrome affects
individuals, and this will
25–31% of
further increase
because of
the increasing prevalence of obesity in
children and young adults [1–4]. Obesity increases the
risk of multiple health conditions, including diabetes,
hypertension and cancer. However, BMI does not
distinguish adipose tissue from other tissues, nor does
it inform fat distribution [1–4].

Epidemiological studies have shown that high BMI
values were strongly associated with increased incidence
of several types of cancer and also premalignant lesions
[5,6]. However, colorectal cancer was shown to be more
strongly associated with waist circumference and visceral
adipose tissue [1,7]. This link is stronger in men because
they have more visceral fat. However, when considering
waist circumference (marker of visceral obesity), differences
between sexes disappear [1,7–11]. Women and men with
waist circumferences >99 and 101 cm, respectively, have
50% higher colon cancer risk [1,7,8,10].
In addition,
infantile obesity was also demonstrated to increase colon
cancer risk in adult life [9,12]. On the other hand, gastric
bypass surgery was shown to decrease the risk of cancer
mortality [13]. In postmenopausal women, obesity has
been associated with higher incidence of breast cancer,
reduced likelihood of survival and increased likelihood of
recurrence [9].

Adipose tissue in obesity and cancer

Adipose tissue contains several cell
types including
adipocytes, preadipocytes, ﬁbroblasts, endothelial cells
and resident macrophages, which produce a broad range
of cytokines, adipocytokines and growth factors, such as
adiponectin, leptin, resistin, visfatin, VEGF, PAI-1, MCP-1
or TNF-a (Figures 1 and 2) [3,9,11,14,15]. Recent studies
correlated pathological
alterations with adipocyte
hypertrophy, rather than hyperplasia. During adipocyte
hypertrophy, activation of NF-kB leads to inactivation of
PPARg and insulin receptor. This conduces to decreased
lipid and glucose uptake, adiponectin secretion and adipo-
genesis. In addition, increased expression of inﬂammatory,
chemoattractant, growth and matrix remodelling factors is
also observed (Figure 2) [1,9,11,15–17]. Consequently, FFAs
accumulate in other tissues such as liver and muscle, causing
hepatic and peripheral lipotoxicity and insulin resistance [18,19].

During this process, adipose tissue localization appears
to be critical. As already discussed, visceral adiposity
has been considered a major risk factor for metabolic
syndrome and apparently for cancer.

It has been suggested that adipose tissue may support
tumour cell growth. Adipose tissue-derived factors have
been shown to inﬂuence the behaviour of tumour cells.
Mature adipocytes promote proliferation of tumour cells
in tridimensional cultures, and adipocyte-conditioned
medium also promotes tumour cell invasion and prolifera-
tion [20]. Further, Carter and Church recently demonstrated
that conditioned medium of adipocytes isolated from breast
adipose tissue increased cell motility of both normal and
malignant breast epithelial cells [21]. In mice, simultaneous
(but not separate) injection of tumoral cells with adipose
tissue results in tumour formation and metastasis [14]. In
addition, Hirose and co-workers showed that db/db mice,
which have hyperleptinaemia and hyperinsulinaemia, have
an increased susceptibility to colon premalignant lesions
induced by azoxymethane [22]. Authors from the same
laboratory also showed that these effects were prevented
by antioxidants [23,24]. Despite the fact that the model
used on these studies has hyperleptinaemia, Aparicio and
colleagues showed that leptin may reduce the development
of premalignant lesions in the colon [25]. Thus, besides
increasing tumour progression, obesity and diabetes
apparently contribute to increased formation of premalignant
lesions, but the role of the different players is still unknown.
The formation of hypoxic regions has a major effect on
cell metabolism. Thus,
it is expected that metabolic
intermediates resulting from hypertrophy may somehow
regulate angiogenesis. In the last decades, many studies
have shown that inﬂammation is the link between them.
Cells respond to metabolic alterations by mechanisms
involved in innate immunity, activating inﬂammatory
pathways [18,19]. Besides resulting in insulin resistance,
this also contributes to angiogenesis. Inﬂammation and
angiogenesis
share common pathways, as most of
cytokines and adipocytokines have pro-angiogenic effects,
contributing to tissue irrigation and also to cancer
progression [9,18–20]. Moreover, both adipose tissue
and tumours recruit macrophages, whereas the tumour
also recruits adipose stroma cells, showing a strong
relation between adipose tissue and the tumour [8]. The
integration of such mechanisms in adipose tissue and
tumour physiology will be discussed in the following
sections.

Metabolic dysregulation in adipose
tissue and tumour cells

Dysregulation of lipid metabolism
Adipocyte hypertrophy results in the accumulation of
secondary metabolites (such as long-chain acetyl-CoA or
diacylglycerol) involved in the activation of several stress and
inﬂammatory pathways, consequently leading to insulin
resistance and triglyceride hydrolysis (Figure 2) [19,26–28].
Like adipocytes, macrophages have the ability to change

cytoplasmatic accumulation of FFAs and hypoxia, leading to activation of inﬂammatory and stress pathways and inactivation of
insulin signalling. These mechanisms involve increased TNF-a, MCP-1, VEGF, resistin and leptin and decreased adiponectin
expression, contributing to increased macrophage inﬁltration. Tissue macrophages regulate matrix degradation and collagen
deposition. These mechanisms constitute a hypoxia feedback mechanism to increase angiogenesis and inhibit continuous adipocyte
growth, decreasing hypoxia. However, most of angiogenic and chemoattractant mediators and macrophages also regulate tumour
growth

lipids,
their phenotype and store large amounts of
leading to foam cell formation, which are common in
hypertrophic adipose tissue. These macrophages have
an increased inﬂammatory potential, creating a positive
inﬂammatory loop in adipose tissue [9]. Importantly,
PPARg controls lipid storage in both adipocytes and
macrophages but is inactivated by such inﬂammatory
pathways (Figure 2). On the other hand, the amount
of lipids that the adipocyte has to process and store
depends on the ability of peripheral organs to oxidize
fatty acids, which is mainly controlled by AMPK
[1,9,11,29,30].

PPARg and diet regulation. PPARg is a nuclear receptor and
transcription factor activated mostly by lipids, increasing
the expression of several proteins involved in fatty acid
uptake and storage [11,15,30] (Figure 2). Furthermore,
PPARg directly inhibits nuclear translocation of the NF-k
B, thereby inhibiting the expression of cytokines and other
inﬂammatory mediators [11,15,30,31]. Although most tu-
mour cells express PPARg, it has not been yet established
whether its expression is related to tumour differentiation
and metastasis [1]. PPARg ligands,
including TZDs, are
known to inhibit proliferation of cancer cells, increasing nu-
clear levels of tumour suppressor BRCA1 [1,14]. Positive
effects of PPARg activators on cancer progression may also
be due to decreased ectopic accumulation of substrates in cy-
toplasm, namely glucose and lipids, and to decreased in-
ﬂammation and insulin resistance.

As PPARg is a diet-regulated transcription factor, the
involvement of dietary lipids in adipocyte homeostasis
appears to be obvious. In fact, saturated FFAs can activate
NF-kB through TLR4 signalling, whereas PUFAs bind to
and activate PPARg [30,31]. Despite PUFAs such as o-3
and o-6 activating PPARg, they were described to have
distinct effects on cancer development and growth. o-3
PUFAs inhibit cancer growth and cell motility, increasing
PPARg activation in cell lines and enhancing cancer cell
apoptosis in mice [11]. On the other hand, o-6 PUFAs
were positively correlated with tumour development in
breast and were shown to promote tumour cell motility
[11]. Thus, diet regulation of PPARg is important for
tumour development, but the underlying mechanisms
remain unknown.

AMP-activated kinase. AMPK, a major energy regulator
activated by adiponectin, increases glycolysis and fatty
acid oxidation and inhibits gluconeogenesis and fatty acid
and cholesterol synthesis [29,32]. However, obese and
type 2 diabetic individuals usually have decreased
adiponectin levels, AMPK activity and fatty acid oxidation.
AMPK inhibits SREBP1c and activates PPARa. This results
in increased expression of several enzymes involved in
fatty acid oxidation and decreased expression of ACC
and FAS, key enzymes of
fatty acid synthesis [33].
Furthermore, AMPK directly inactivates ACC, thereby
decreasing malonyl-CoA formation (inhibitor of CPT-
1-mediated mitochondrial
from
acetyl-CoA, resulting in higher rates of mitochondrial

acid uptake)

fatty

fatty acid uptake and oxidation [9,29,32,34]. AMPK
activates PI3K and Akt and induces GLUT-4 transloca-
tion to the cell membrane, thereby increasing glucose
uptake [29,32,35]. Moreover, Abbot and colleagues recently
showed that AMPK is necessary for Akt-mediated fatty acid
uptake in the muscle [35].

Several authors suggested AMPK-induced inhibition of
lipid synthesis as a good strategy to decrease lipid
availability for cell membranes during tumour growth [34].
AMPK also activates p53,
inhibiting the cell cycle [34].
Furthermore, AMPK inhibits aromatase expression in
adipose tissue, contributing to decreased oestrogen
levels and preventing the development of oestrogen-
dependent tumours [34]. Thus, AMPK activation has been
proposed as an effective strategy for cancer therapy, and
positive results have been observed after metformin
treatment, a known activator of AMPK [34].

Hypoxia
A reliable feature of hypertrophic adipose tissue is hypoxia
(resulting from decreased blood supply), which is also
conducive to the activation of inﬂammatory pathways,
macrophage recruitment and dysregulation of adipocyto-
kine secretion [9,36,37]. However, hypoxia is also
common in tumours. HIF-1 is the key factor in cell
response to hypoxia,
stimulating inﬂammation and
angiogenesis
(discussed in the following sections)
[38,39]. These mechanisms are likely to support tumour
growth [9]. Furthermore, HIF-1 exerts signiﬁcant effects
on cellular metabolism. Cancer cells have a signiﬁcant
shift away from oxidative phosphorylation in mitochon-
dria towards glycolysis, a state involved in the ‘Warburg
effect’ [40–42]. Warburg ﬁrstly described that cancer cells
have increased glucose uptake and ATP formation (see
comprehensive revisions about this issue in [92–94]).
As tumour is mostly hypoxic, HIF-1 increases the transcrip-
tion of the cell-surface glucose transporter GLUT-1 and
contributes to the expression of several glycolytic enzymes,
including lactate dehydrogenase, and inhibits acetyl-CoA
formation, which would be used in the oxidative phosphor-
ylation [40,42]. In addition, because of the high rate of
glucose consumption, malignant cells accumulate high
amounts of pyruvate, which can be used to fuel the
tricarboxylic acid cycle for biosynthetic processes, and even
earlier by-products of glycolysis will enter the pentose
phosphate pathway for the maintenance of DNA, RNA
and fatty acids. Recently, our colleagues showed that
methylglyoxal, a metabolite of glycolysis, increases HIF-1
degradation in hypoxic conditions [43]. However, cancer
cells develop resistance mechanisms
such as elevated
expression of glyoxalases, which degrade methylglyoxal [44].
Glyoxalase expression is inhibited in most cells in
hyperglycaemic conditions, possibly accounting for the
different ability of normal and tumoral cells to adapt to
hypoxic conditions [44,45]. The contribution of adipose
tissue hypoxia to tumour development is unknown, but
tumours are usually surrounded by adipose tissue; thus,
it is likely that such an environment may contribute to
a better tumour adaptation [46].

Adipose Tissue Dysfunction and Cancer

Cytokines and adipocytokines –
metabolism, inﬂammation and
angiogenesis

Activation of inﬂammatory pathways as a consequence of
accumulation of intracellular metabolites and formation
of hypoxic regions leads to altered cytokine and adipocy-
tokine secretion. This conduces to inhibition of continued
lipids and glucose uptake and stimulates angiogenesis.
However, most of the products released by the adipose
tissue under such conditions may also affect tumour
physiology [30,47–49]. In this section, we review the
alterations of these factors as a result of adipose tissue
dysfunction and how they inﬂuence tumour formation
and development.

Adiponectin
Adiponectin circulates in three distinct molecular forms,
trimeric, hexameric and high-molecular-weight
forms
(several hexameric forms), and it is mainly produced by
the adipose tissue [50–52]. Adiponectin levels, especially
high-molecular-weight forms, were found to be lower in
obesity,
insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes and
inversely correlated with abdominal perimeter and fat
mass, more than BMI [1,14,15,53]. Adiponectin expression
is decreased by TNF-a and IL-6 (NF-kB activators) and
increased by PPARg
(Figure 2). However,
adiponectin also inhibits TNF-a and IL-6 expression in macro-
phages,
inactivating the inﬂammatory cascade [14,20].
Adiponectin increases fatty acid oxidation and insulin
sensitivity
it
activates AMPK and PPARa [1,20].

Adiponectin decreases proliferation of several cell types
including adipocytes, endothelial cells and cancer cells [20].
Beyond inhibition of tumour cell growth and survival,
adiponectin inhibits angiogenesis through decreased
VEGF and Bcl-2 expression (anti-apoptotic) and increased
p53, Bax and caspase activation (pro-apoptotic), leading
to endothelial cell apoptosis [1,20]. Likewise, adiponectin
was shown to reduce TNF-a-induced effects on cell
proliferation and migration [53]. In fact, several studies
showed hypoadiponectinaemia as a determinant for larger
tumours with increased angiogenesis [1,14,20]. Thus,
adiponectin may
only
inﬂammation but also angiogenesis, and these effects
may be crucial for regulation of neovascularization in
pathological conditions such as obesity, type 2 diabetes
and also cancer. However, it is not known yet whether
hypoadiponectinaemia is a risk factor for cancer or
hypoadiponectinemia and cancer development are
parallel events of metabolic dysregulation.

Leptin
Leptin is currently at the centre of the obesity–cancer link,
as it is produced in proportion to fat mass (almost
exclusively in adipocytes) and potently induces cell
(normal
and
motility [14,20,48,54–57]. Leptin activates JAK/STAT

inhibiting insulin and its own signalling cascade
[1,15,56,57]. This mechanism is chronically activated in
obesity and is one of the major causes of leptin and insulin
resistance [1,14,58].

independently of BMI

Clinical studies in Norwegian and Japanese populations
showed leptin correlation with increased risk of breast
and colon cancers,
[45,59].
Furthermore, leptin was also positively correlated with
increased metastization [1,20,51,60]. In most of the patients,
tumour cells express the Ob-Rb. Insulin, IGF-1 and oestradiol
were observed to activate its expression [61]. In addition,
leptin also promotes aromatase expression in adipose
tissue and ER on tumour cells [14,62]. However, leptin
is mitogenic for both ER-positive and ER-negative
tumour cell lines, inhibiting apoptosis and increasing cell
proliferation [14,20,48,53,62].

From this, we may conclude that leptin promotes
tumour cell proliferation both directly and indirectly
(through an increase of oestrogen levels and insulin
resistance). However, leptin effects on cancer development
are still controversial. Several studies reported elevated
leptin levels in cancer patients, but these studies compared
cancer patients with healthy controls without separation of
the obesity component
in the experimental design.
Furthermore, existing studies did not reveal a pattern of
leptin variation between premenopause and postmeno-
pause. Zucker rats, which have a mutation in Ob-Rb and
exhibit hyperleptinaemia, have increased formation of
benign neoplasies but minimal
formation of malign
tumours [53]. In fact, it is possible that leptin does not
act as a tumour inducer but more as a supporter of already
formed tumours.

Resistin
Resistin has been pointed as a major link between innate
immunity and glucose metabolism as it was shown to
inhibit hepatic, muscle and adipose insulin signalling,
consequently leading to inﬂammation and insulin
resistance. Its circulating levels are usually increased in
models of obesity. Antibody neutralization, overexpres-
sion of nonfunctional resistin or gene knockout in mice
results in improved glucose metabolism and insulin
sensitivity [15,18,63–65]. However, extrapolating possible
effects of human resistin from murine experiments has
several caveats. Murine resistin is produced in adipocytes,
whereas human resistin is mainly produced in macrophages
(Figure 2) [15,18,65]. Furthermore, human and murine
resistin genes are located in different chromosomes, and
studies searching for a human gene more similar to murine
resistin have been unsuccessful [15].

Recently, Qatanani and colleagues developed mice with
suppressed expression of endogenous resistin and transgenic
expression of human resistin in macrophages [18].
After consuming a high-calorie diet, these rats had
increased lipolysis in adipose tissue. They also developed
increased triglyceride and diacylglycerol levels and insulin
resistance in muscle, due to PKC-induced serine phosphor-
ylation of insulin receptor and IRS-1 (Figure 2) [18].
Resistin promotes foam cell formation from macrophages

through increased lipid uptake, resulting from activation
of scavenger receptors (SR-1 and CD36) involved in
recruiting lipoproteins and FATP. Conversely, resistin
increases proteasomal degradation of ABCA1 involved
in cholesterol efﬂux [15,66].

Human resistin stimulates proliferation of vessel muscle
cells and VECs [15,65,67]. In endothelial and choriocarci-
noma cells, resistin also increases the expression of VEGF
and its receptors while also elevating MMP, possibly
through NF-kB activation [65,68]. Thus,
resistin
overexpression is a physiological response to adipose
tissue hypertrophy and hypoxia, but it may also contribute
to tumour angiogenesis. Despite the data about this issue
still being scarce, several studies have implicated resistin
in the aetiology of obesity-related cancers, namely breast
and colon [50,51,64,69–72]. Resistin may provide unique
insights to the link between obesity, inﬂammation, insulin
resistance and cancer risk in humans.

Visfatin
Visfatin is highly expressed in visceral fat of rodents and
humans, whose plasma circulating levels are positively
correlated with the size of visceral fat deposits [73].
Several studies reported increased visfatin levels in
various pathological conditions, such as obesity, inﬂamma-
tion, diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome and cardiovas-
cular diseases [74–78].

phosphoribosyltransferase,

Visfatin was originally isolated from lymphocytes as
an enzyme
nicotinamide
that
synthesizes nicotinamide mononucleotide from
nicotinamide [79]. The following studies reported an
insulin-mimetic effect through binding to a different
region of
insulin receptor, activating IRS-1 tyrosine
phosphorylation [73,80–86]. However, the original study
reporting these effects was later retracted [73], and the
mechanisms of visfatin action, beyond NAD+ synthesis,
remain obscure. Nevertheless, visfatin expression was found
to be stimulated by HIF-1 and the JNK/NF-kB pathway,
promoting angiogenesis
through MMP expression in
endothelial cells and VEGF expression in tumour cells
[79,87–89]. Visfatin is also expressed in tumoral cells, and
its circulating levels were found to be increased in breast
and colon cancer patients [82,87]. Furthermore, visfatin
was observed to increase cell proliferation and invasion
during breast cancer progression [87]. Visfatin inhibitors
have been clinically evaluated as anticancer agents, but
new epidemiological and cellular studies are needed to
understand the mechanisms of visfatin action on cancer [90].

Tumour necrosis factor alpha
TNF-a was the ﬁrst recognized adipose-derived cytokine
to be involved in metabolism regulation. In this ﬁeld,
Hotamisligil’s laboratory has been particularly active,
producing data and reviews about TNF-a’s role on
adipocyte metabolism (see reviews in [31,47]). TNF-a is
produced mainly in macrophages, but also in adipocytes
and preadipocytes, after excessive lipid accumulation,
activating several serine kinases (JNK and IKK). This
results in NF-kB activation and inhibition of
insulin

signalling (Figure 2) [1,14,15,20]. NF-kB stimulates the
production of other cytokines and inhibits PPARg activity
and subsequent expression of adiponectin, CD36 and
LPL. Thus, TNF-a inhibits preadipocyte differentiation,
lipid and glucose uptake and fatty acid esteriﬁcation and
increases lipolysis [1,53]. These mechanisms aim to
inhibit continued adipocyte growth but may also be
important for cancer progression because they lead to
metabolism dysregulation (as focused on in Section 2.1)
and hyperinsulinaemia, when chronically active. In fact,
a link between TNF-a levels and breast and colon cancer
has been suggested [14]. Beyond its metabolic effects,
TNF-a seems to contribute to tissue alterations necessary
for tumour growth and metastasis, namely cell proliferation.
TNF-a stimulates aromatase expression in adipose tissue,
increasing oestrogen-mediated tumour cell proliferation
[20,91–93]. Furthermore, TNF-a stimulates VEC prolifera-
tion and migration in rat cornea [53]. Clinical trials with
several TNF-a antagonists and antibodies have shown
promising effects in reducing tumour development and
metastasis [94].

Monocyte chemoattractant protein 1
MCP-1 is a protein that recruits and activates circulating
monocytes to the adipose tissue [95–98]. Initially, MCP-1
was considered an activator of antitumour cytotoxic
functions of macrophages. However, identiﬁcation of two
types of TAMs and the revelation of MCP-1 angiogenic
potential altered the perspective of MCP-1 physiology on
cancer (Figure 2) [95,99,100]. In the last years, several
studies have found elevated MCP-1 levels, especially in
advanced stages [96,99]. However, it is not established
whether MCP-1 circulating levels are a systemic marker
of poor prognosis or not. Some discrepancies may be
caused by different studied populations, experimental
designs, degree of metastasis, tumour phase and time of
sample collection [99].

In adipose tissue, MCP-1 expression correlates with
increased macrophage inﬁltration and angiogenesis
[19,28,36]. In epithelial cells, MCP-1 expression is low,
but it is acquired along with the transformation [98,99].
MCP-1 is also secreted by tumour stroma cells, such as
macrophages and ﬁbroblasts, acting through paracrine
and autocrine pathways [95,99]. Recently, Niu and
colleagues showed that MCP-1 promoted in vitro tube
formation in HUVEC. In addition, Hong and colleagues
showed that these effects were dependent on VEGF
activation [101,102]. Furthermore, MCP-1 was observed
to increase angiopoietin (Ang)-2 levels and MMP
expression on monocytes, T cells and tumour cells, which
also contributes to angiogenesis [96,99,103]. On tumour
cells, MCP-1 does not induce proliferation but increases
their migration ability. MCP-1 was also suggested to be
involved in epithelial-to-mesenchymal
transformation,
an event essential for cell transformation [99]. Higher
levels of MCP-1 are correlated with increased macrophage
inﬁltration, MSC migration, vascularization,
tumour
progression and lymphatic invasion [95,96,99,104]. An
anti-MCP-1 antibody decreased MSC migration to tumour,

angiogenesis and lung metastasis, increasing the survival
ratio [99,104]. Thus, as
in adipose tissue, MCP-1
and recruited macrophages change the tumour microenvi-
ronment to support cell proliferation and migration and
angiogenesis.

Angiogenic mechanisms – growth
factors and matrix remodelling

Adipose tissue profoundly depends on angiogenesis as it is
subjected to constant expansion/regression. Capillary
growth is a complex process involving matrix degradation,
endothelial cell migration and tube formation and depends
on the anastomosis of two growing tubes. This process is
regulated by several factors, namely ﬁbroblast growth
factors, hepatic growth factor (HGF), VEGF, Angs (Ang-1
and Ang-2), epithelial growth factors, adipocytokines,
insulin/IGF-1, oestrogens and MMP, some of them already
discussed in this review [53].

Several adipose-derived factors have paracrine effects,
acting directly on neighbouring endothelial cells to
promote angiogenesis. Most of these factors are produced
in response to adipocyte hypertrophy and consequent
metabolic dysregulation and regional hypoxia. As we
already discussed, the unifying point is inﬂammation,
which results from both of these conditions. Inﬂammatory
mediators directly induce angiogenesis and increase the
expression of several angiogenic factors. Furthermore,
most of these factors also recruit macrophages, which also
produce their own set of angiogenic factors (VEGF, TNF-a,
ﬁbroblast growth factors, MMPS and resistin), further
contributing to angiogenesis (Figure 2) [53,105,106].

Tumour angiogenesis is important for its growth, but
vessels are usually dysfunctional with abnormal ramiﬁca-
tions, probably due to the imbalanced expression of growth
factors in hypertrophic adipose tissue and in the tumour.
Furthermore, these vessels are usually very permeable and
allow the passage of ﬂuids, proteins and tumour cells,
favouring metastization.

Growth factors
VEGF is the only angiogenic factor speciﬁc for VECs.
Obese individuals commonly have increased VEGF levels
[see review at 53]. VEGF is produced by adipose tissue
cells, namely adipocytes, preadipocytes and macro-
phages, stimulating VEC proliferation and migration, ex-
pression of proteolytic enzymes and tube formation and
inhibiting apoptosis (Figure 2) [53]. VEGF expression is
stimulated by regional hypoxia (through HIF-1 stabiliza-
tion), factors from the EGF family and insulin (via PI3K
and Akt), to compensate for insulin-induced nutrient
deposition and tissue expansion [53,107,108]. Recently,
our group described the VEGF/Ang-2 ratio to determine
vascular integrity. The imbalance of this ratio caused
endothelial cell apoptosis and loss of vessel
integrity
[109]. However, increased tumour VEGF levels are also
associated with poor prognosis [53]. Consequently,

several antitumour drugs based on its neutralization
were developed. Antibody neutralization of VEGF recep-
tor 2 also decreased both angiogenesis and preadipocyte
differentiation [53].

Other growth factors such as bFGF and HGF have also
been studied as possible players in tumour growth. bFGF
and HGF are produced in adipocytes and stimulate VEC
proliferation and MMP expression [20,53,110]. For bFGF,
no correlations with BMI were found in previous studies,
probably because it acts mainly through paracrine
mechanisms [53]. HGF is known to act on its receptor
Met (product of c-met gene) and to promote proliferation,
motility and invasion of hepatic tumour parenchymal cells
[53,110,111]. However, HFG is produced proportionally
to BMI and correlates with bigger tumours and increased
lymphatic invasion [20,53]. Furthermore, HGF promotes
cell invasion independently of VEGF and also increases
its expression [20,53,110,111]. HGF is highly produced
in tumour or peritumoral adipose tissue, decreasing after
tumour excision [20].

Proteolytic matrix degradation – plasminogen system
Besides MMPs, the plasminogen system also regulates
extracellular matrix degradation, to allow vessel growth.
This system is formed by the plasminogen, cleavage
enzymes (tissue plasminogen activator and uPA and
serine proteases), PAI-1 and membrane uPA receptor
(uPAR), regulating ﬁbrinolysis and matrix proteolysis
[see review at 11]. Plasminogen is cleaved to plasmin by
its tissue plasminogen activator in arterial walls and
by uPA in the extracellular matrix,
increasing matrix
degradation [11]. Furthermore, uPA binding to uPAR
leads to integrin binding and cytoskeleton arrangement
favouring cell migration [11]. Thus, uPA and uPAR are
markers of invasiveness and poor prognosis. uPA inhibition
results in decreased tumour invasiveness. On the other hand,
PAI-1 binds to and inhibits uPA. This complex binds to uPAR
and is internalized [11]. Despite uPA inhibition effects, circu-
lating PAI-1 levels are a marker of poor prognosis in breast
cancer, and it was suggested as a potential target in cancer
therapy [11]. Although the reasons for elevated PAI-1 levels
are not known, it is known to be highly produced in dysfunc-
tional adipose tissue, and it has been suggested to promote
cell growth and migration, angiogenesis and migration of
smooth muscle cells [11,112].

Insulin – mitogenesis and IGF-1
regulation

Insulin resistance is common in patients with elevated
BMI and is a hallmark of type 2 diabetes, being usually
associated with visceral obesity and inﬂammation in
adipose tissue [7,14,15]. Also, the effects of insulin analogues
in type 1 diabetic patients have been discussed in the last
years. Long-action insulin analogues, such as glargine, are
widely used because they do not cause hypoglycaemia.
However, attempting to efﬁciently control postprandial
glycaemia with these medications, authors have found that

patients are episodically hyperinsulinaemic [113]. Hyperin-
sulinaemia has been pointed as a major risk factor for breast,
colon and prostate cancer [7,14,15,114–116]. Also, elevated
C-peptide levels were found to be associated with a threefold
increase in colon cancer risk [1,12].

that

Insulin has been shown to increase cell survival and
growth (through the IRS-1–PI3K–Akt pathway), supporting
[113]. Furthermore, Chen and
tumour development
colleagues
recently
reported
insulin-mediated
activation of this pathway causes chemotherapy resistance,
originating new questions about the role of insulin on
cancer [117,118]. However, the impact of insulin mitogenic
effects on obesity-related cancer through this pathway is
controversial, as IRS-1 is partially inhibited on insulin
resistance. Thus,
the discovery of a noncanonical
pathway for insulin-stimulated mitogenesis is a major
hallmark on metabolism-related cancer. Most growth
factors activate the canonical Ras–Raf–MAPK pathway.
Besides increasing IGF-1 and VEGF circulating levels
and aromatase expression in adipose tissue, insulin was
also observed to increase isoprenylated (active) Ras
levels in the cell membrane, thereby increasing cell
response to other growth factors (see review in [113]).
The IGF family components include IGF-1 and 2,
membrane receptors (IGFR1 and 2), IGFBPs (IGFBP1 to
IGFBP6) and IGFBP proteases [14]. Like insulin, IGF-1
regulates cell survival, growth and differentiation and
inhibits apoptosis [9]. On the other hand,
IGFBPs
decrease IGF bioavailability,
inhibiting its effects and
promoting apoptosis [14]. However, IGFBP1 and IGFBP2
expressions are downregulated by insulin,
increasing
free/active IGF-1 levels [3,8]. Insulin-resistant individuals
commonly have higher IGF-1 circulating levels [3,8,9].

On epithelial cells, IGF-1–IGFR binding leads to receptor
dimerization and to PI3K and Ras–Raf–MAPK activation
[14]. Furthermore, oestrogens increase IGF-1 and IGFR1
expressions, acting synergistically in favour of
tumour
growth [14]. As insulin, IGF-1 also activates VEGF expres-
sion and thus indirectly acts on endothelial cells [1].
Elevated IGF-1 and decreased IGFBP-1 levels were
previously correlated with increased cancer risk, tumour
invasion and poor prognosis [1,14]. Also, breast tumours
with elevated IGFR-1 levels, both premenopause and
postmenopause, usually are more invasive [14]. In mice,
IGF-1 overexpression resulted in increased tumour growth,
whereas disruption of IGFR1 prevented it [8,9,14].

The role of macrophages on tissue
remodelling – implications in adipose
tissue and tumour

In obese individuals, adipose tissue commonly has
extensive macrophage inﬁltration, recruited by TNF-a
and particularly by MCP-1 (Figure 2). On the other hand,
macrophage-secreted products such as TNF-a or resistin
induce insulin resistance and promote angiogenesis
(Figure 2). Macrophage coculture results in impaired

adipocytokine expression and increased production of
pro-inﬂammatory cytokines in adipocytes [8].

Tumour environment is formed by several cell types,
namely ﬁbroblasts, cells from hematopoietic lineage,
endothelial cells and adipocytes. These cells strongly
interact, creating a microenvironment that is conducive
to tumour growth [119,120]. Adipose-related tumours
have large amounts of macrophages (up to 50% of the
tumour cells) [100,105,119,120]. More than 80% of
cancers have elevated macrophage inﬁltration, correlating
with increased vessel density, tumour progression and poor
prognosis [53,99,100,104,105,119]. Genetic macrophage
elimination reduces tumour progression and metastasis in
mice [8].

A tumour commonly has two distinct populations of
macrophages: M1 macrophages are pro-inﬂammatory
and secrete antitumour cytokines and M2 macrophages
are immunosuppressive and produce a broad range of
angiogenic and growth factors, including MCP-1, MMPs,
TGF-b, VEGF and PDGF, promoting proliferation and
migration of tumour cells and VEC, matrix degradation
and ultimately angiogenesis
[8,49,104–106,119–121].
The reason why this macrophage population acquires this
behaviour is still unknown. However, this is also observed
in macrophages recruited to the hypertrophic adipose
tissue, which are involved in tissue remodelling and
angiogenesis [36].

Macrophages

intensely populate the ﬁbrotic ring
surrounding the tumour and regions of basal membrane
rupture. They seem to regulate collagen synthesis in
ﬁbroblasts and also support blood vessel formation close
to collagen ﬁbres [119]. This leads to increased collagen
deposition, anchored to blood vessels, allowing faster
tumour cell migration to the circulation (Figure 1)
[100,119]. These features are not found in macrophage-
deﬁcient mice [8,119]. Importantly, adipose tissue from
obese animal models was recently described to develop
extensive ﬁbrotic regions, which may support growth of
adipose-associated tumours
from
tumour periphery also have high aromatase expression,
which is increased by macrophage-released cytokines
such as TNF-a [14,20].

[121]. Fibroblasts

The close relation between tumour cells and macrophages
in the invasive front involves CSF-1 and EGF signalling
[100,120]. Tumour
cells express CSF-1 to increase
macrophage activity, and macrophages express EGF to
stimulate migration of tumour cells. Accordingly, macro-
phages express CSF-1R whereas tumour cells express
EGFR1 [119]. Mice with CSF-1 depletion have decreased
VEGF and MMP expression and metastization and more
benign phenotypes. CSF-1 expression restores phenotype,
and CSF-1 overexpression in normal mice leads to more
TAM and increased tumour growth and metastization
[100,119]. Moreover, macrophage depletion results in 40%
decreased angiogenesis
even in advanced tumours,
suggesting that macrophages are involved in the formation
of new blood vessels and in the remodelling of those already
existing, as observed during adipose tissue expansion
[36,100,119]. Macrophage-derived VEGF, beyond VEC

stimulation, also recruits other macrophages to support
tumour growth [100,119]. Present data show that TAM
and adipose tissue macrophages share important similari-
ties, promoting tissue remodelling and angiogenesis. In
addition, adipose tissue macrophages may possibly support
tumour development.
