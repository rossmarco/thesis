Abstract

Cancer prevention guidelines recommend limiting intake of red meat and avoiding processed meat; however, few studies

have been conducted on the effects of speciﬁc red meat subtypes on colon cancer or rectal cancer risk. The study aim was

to evaluate associations between intake of red meat and its subtypes, processed meat, ﬁsh, and poultry and risk for colon

cancer or rectal cancer in the Danish Diet, Cancer and Health cohort study. We also evaluated whether ﬁsh or poultry

should replace red meat intake to prevent colon cancer or rectal cancer. During follow-up (13.4 y), 644 cases of colon

cancer and 345 cases of rectal cancer occurred among 53,988 participants. Cox proportional hazards models were used to

compute incidence rate ratio (IRRs) and 95% CIs. No associations were found between intake of red meat, processed

meat, ﬁsh, or poultry and risk for colon cancer or rectal cancer. The risk associated with speciﬁc red meat subtypes

depended on the animal of origin and cancer subsite; thus, the risk for colon cancer was signiﬁcantly elevated for higher

intake of lamb [IRRper 5g/d = 1.07 (95% CI: 1.02–1.13)], whereas the risk for rectal cancer was elevated for higher intake of
pork [IRRper 25g/d = 1.18 (95% CI: 1.02–1.36)]. Substitution of ﬁsh for red meat was associated with a signiﬁcantly lower
risk for colon cancer [IRRper 25g/d = 0.89 (95% CI: 0.80–0.99)] but not rectal cancer. Substitution of poultry for red meat did
not reduce either risk. This study suggests that the risks for colon cancer and potentially for rectal cancer differ according

to the speciﬁc red meat subtype consumed. J. Nutr. 143: 464–472, 2013.

Introduction

In 2007, the World Cancer Research Fund/American Institute
for Cancer Research (WCRF/AICR)6 concluded that red and
processed meat were ‘‘convincing’’ risk factors for colorectal
cancer (1). This expert conclusion is supported by the results of
an updated dose-response meta-analysis of epidemiological
studies published up to March 2011, which showed signiﬁcant
17 and 18% higher risks for colorectal cancer with red and
processed meat, respectively, when analyzed separately for every
100 g/d increase in intake (2). Based on the current evidence, the
WCRF/AICR recommends limiting the intake of red meat and

avoiding processed meat (1). The recommendation, however,
makes no distinction between different types of red meat (i.e.,
beef, pork, veal, and lamb).

In contrast to red and processed meat (which is mainly based
on red meat), white meat (i.e., ﬁsh and poultry) has not been
associated with increased risks for colorectal cancer (3). This
difference was proposed to be due to endogenous formation of
intestinal carcinogenic N-nitroso compounds (NOCs) (4). In
controlled dietary intervention studies, intake of red meat, but
not white meat, has been shown to increase endogenous formation
of NOCs in a dose-response manner (5). It has been suggested that
this effect is mediated by heme iron, which is highly abundant in
red meat (6). Although all red meat contains heme iron, there are
species variations: the highest amounts have been reported in beef
and lamb and lower levels in pork and veal (7). Thus, if the
potential carcinogenic effect of red meat is driven by heme iron,
the risk might vary according to red meat subtype. Individual
associations between speciﬁc red meat subtypes (e.g., beef and
pork) and risks for colon and rectal cancer have, however, been
evaluated in only 3 previous prospective studies, which gave
conﬂicting results (8–10). In addition to heme iron, exogenously
formed NOCs in processed meat and compounds created by
cooking of meat, including heterocyclic amines (HCAs) and

polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), offer further potential
underlying biological mechanisms (11,12).

An effect modiﬁcation by other lifestyle factors on the
associations between red and processed meat and risk for colon
and rectal cancers has been hypothesized. In some studies, stronger
positive associations were found between either red meat intake or
heme iron intake and colorectal cancer risk among alcohol drinkers
(13,14). Also, the association between red and processed meat and
colorectal cancer risk was less pronounced in people with a higher
intake of dietary ﬁber (10).

Within the Danish Diet, Cancer and Health study, we aimed
to examine associations between intake of red meat and its
subtypes (i.e., beef, pork, veal, and lamb), processed meat, ﬁsh,
and poultry and the risks for colon and rectal cancer and
investigated whether the associations were modiﬁed by alcohol
or dietary ﬁber intake. Furthermore, because different types of
meat may contribute to different amounts of potential meat-
derived carcinogens, e.g., heme iron, we also examined the effect
of replacing red meat with ﬁsh or poultry and the effect of the
mutual replacements between speciﬁc red meat subtypes on the
risks for colon and rectal cancer.

Subjects and Methods

Study population. Diet, Cancer and Health is a large, ongoing,
prospective cohort study that was designed to primarily investigate the
relations among diet, lifestyle, and the incidence of cancer (15). Between
1993 and 1997, 160,725 Danish men and women were invited to
participate. The study inclusion criteria were: age 50–64 y, living in the
greater Copenhagen and Aarhus areas, born in Denmark, and not
registered with a cancer diagnosis in the Danish Cancer Registry (16,17).
Invitees were identiﬁed by the unique 10-digit identiﬁcation number
allocated to every Danish citizen by the Danish Civil Registration System
(18). Of those invited, 57,053 (27,178 men and 29,875 women) agreed
to participate (35.5%). They completed 2 questionnaires on diet and
lifestyle, provided biological samples (e.g., blood samples), and under-
went anthropometric measurements. Approval for this study was obtained
from the regional ethical committees on human studies in Copenhagen and
Aarhus and by the Danish Data Protection Agency.

For the present analysis, people were excluded if they had a previous
cancer diagnosis (because of delayed registration in the Danish Cancer
Registry) before baseline (n = 571), if they had not ﬁlled in a lifestyle
questionnaire (n = 37), or if information was missing on the variables
(meat exposures or confounders) considered in the analyses (n = 2456).
After all exclusions, the cohort comprised 53,988 participants (25,832
men and 28,156 women).

Data assessment. Habitual diet during the 12 mo before the study
baseline was determined from a 192-item FFQ sent to each cohort
participant by mail before their visit to 1 of 2 established study centers in
Copenhagen and Aarhus. The development and validation of this FFQ
were previously described (19,20). Dietary consumption was assessed in
12 categories of predeﬁned responses, ranging from ‘‘never’’ to ‘‘eight
times or more per day.’’ Daily intakes of foods and nutrients were
calculated for each participant with the software program FoodCalc
(21). Standard gender-speciﬁc portion sizes speciﬁcally developed for the
cohort population were used (22,23).

Of the 192 foods and recipes in the FFQ, 63 covered intake of meat
items and meat dishes. The exposure variables considered for the present
analysis were intake in grams per day of red meat, processed meat, ﬁsh,
and poultry. Red meat consisted of fresh and minced beef, veal, pork,
lamb, and offal; we further subdivided red meat into 4 subgroups
reﬂecting their animal of origin: beef, pork, veal, and lamb. Intake of
processed meat was calculated by adding up intake of red meat that had
undergone some form of processing, such as salting, smoking, or curing;
this included bacon, smoked or cooked ham, other cold cuts, salami,
frankfurter, Cumberland sausage, and liver p^at´e. Processed meat was

further subgrouped into sausages, cold cuts, and liver p^at´e. Because
intake of bacon was not speciﬁed in the FFQ, it was estimated from
recipes; bacon could therefore not be considered a separate exposure.
As processed meat was mostly pork, we were unable to differentiate
processed meat by origin. Fish comprised all fresh and processed ﬁsh.
Poultry was assessed as the sum of chicken and turkey.

The lifestyle questionnaire contained detailed questions on several
social factors, health status, reproductive factors, and lifestyle habits.
From this questionnaire, we extracted the following information: years
of schooling, use of hormone replacement therapy, sports activity, smoking
status, alcohol consumption, and use of nonsteroidal antiinﬂammatory
drugs (NSAIDs). The waist circumference of all participants was measured
by trained health professionals at the study clinic visit.

During the visit to the study clinic, the 2 self-administered question-
naires were processed by optical scanning and checked for missing values,
so that unclear information could be clariﬁed with each participant. A
few missing values were accepted in the lifestyle questionnaire but not in
the FFQ.

Follow-up and case ascertainment. The personal
identiﬁcation
numbers of all cohort members were linked to the Danish Civil Registration
System (18) to obtain information on vital status and emigration. Each
study participant was followed up for colon or rectal cancer from the date
of entry into the study, taken as the date of visit to the study center, until the
date of diagnosis of any cancer (except nonmelanoma skin cancer), date of
death, date of emigration, or December 31, 2009. Loss to follow-up was
minor (0.7%). Information on cancer incidence was obtained by linkage to
the Danish Cancer Registry (16,17), which contains data on all cancers
diagnosed in Denmark. The deﬁnitions of colon and rectal cancer were
those of the 10th Revision of the International Classiﬁcation of Diseases.
Cancers of the colon were tumors with codes C18.0–C18.9 and C19;
proximal colon tumors included the cecum, appendix, ascending colon,
hepatic ﬂexure, transverse colon, and splenic ﬂexure (C18.1–C18.5),
whereas distal colon tumors included those in the descending (C18.6)
and sigmoid (C18.7) colon and at the rectosigmoid junction (C19.9).
Colon tumors at overlapping lesions (C18.8) and colon tumors not
otherwise speciﬁed (C18.9) were grouped with all colon cancers only.
Rectal cancers were tumors of the rectum (C20); anal canal tumors were
not considered in this study.

Statistical analyses. Analyses of the relations between red meat and its
subtypes, processed meat and its subtypes, ﬁsh, and poultry and colon
and rectal cancer rates were based on Cox proportional hazards models
(including time-dependent variables), with age as the time axis to ensure
that the estimation procedure was based on comparisons of people of the
same age, which allowed for age adjustment to prevent confounding by
age. The other time variable, time under study, was included as a time-
dependent variable modeled by a linear spline with boundaries at 1, 2,
and 3 y after entry into the study cohort to allow the hazard rate to
change with time (24). Initially, separate analyses were done for men and
women, but because no substantial differences emerged, we tested
whether the results could be presented for both genders combined. Tests
for interaction between intake of meat (i.e., red meat, processed meat,
poultry, and ﬁsh) and gender were performed by testing whether the
slopes differed signiﬁcantly by estimating separate slopes for intake of
meat in the 2 categories of gender. This model was compared with a
model estimating a single, common slope for intake of meat by using the
likelihood ratio test. Because the tests for interaction between intake of
meat and gender were not signiﬁcant (all P-interaction > 0.11), the data
were combined. In all analyses, however, stratiﬁcation according to
gender was performed so that the basic (underlying) hazards were gender
speciﬁc.

Models evaluating the individual associations between intake of red
meat and its subtypes, processed meat and its subtypes, ﬁsh, and poultry
and risk for colon or rectal cancer are presented with and without
adjustment for potential colon and rectal cancer risk factors and meat
exposures mutually adjusted for each other. The following baseline
values of potential colon and rectal cancer risk factors were included as
covariates in the adjusted models: waist circumference (cm; continuous);
schooling [low (#7 y), medium (8–10 y), and high ($11 y)]; smoking

status (never, former, or current smoker); hormone replacement therapy
status in women only (never, former, or current user); sports activities
[entered as 2 variables: an indicator variable (nonactive/active), in which
nonactive was deﬁned as reporting no hours of sports activities per week
and active was reporting sports activities (the lowest possible reported
activity level being half an hour), and a linear variable (number of hours
per week; continuous)]; alcohol intake [entered as 2 variables: an indicator
variable (alcohol abstainer: yes/no) separating those reporting no intake of
alcohol from those reporting drinking any alcohol, and a linear variable
(g/d; continuous)]; NSAID intake (nonuser or user); dietary ﬁber intake
(g/d; continuous); and total energy (kJ/d; continuous) by the standard
method. Use of the nutrient density method to adjust for total energy (i.e.,
adjusting dietary variables for total energy) resulted in similar risk estimates
(data not shown). Further adjustment for saturated fat intake and fruit
and vegetable intake did not change the risk estimates and these variables
were therefore not included in the ﬁnal adjusted model.

We further tested for interactions between intake of red meat, processed
meat, ﬁsh, and poultry and alcohol intake and dietary ﬁber intake (total
and source speciﬁc). This was done by testing whether the slopes for the
intake of meat signiﬁcantly differed by estimating separate slopes for the
intake of meat in 3 groups of either alcohol or dietary ﬁber intake. This
model was compared with another model estimating a single common
slope for the intakes of meat by the likelihood ratio test.

Because different types of meats may contribute different amounts of
potential meat-derived carcinogens, e.g., heme iron, we further estimated
the risks for colon and rectal cancer associated with replacing red meat
with either ﬁsh or poultry and after replacing one red meat subtype with
another. Cox proportional hazards models were ﬁtted, all including
intake of total meat, the meat exposure of interest, and all other meat
except the meat substituting for (i.e., kept out of the model). All models
were adjusted for the same covariates described above.

In all models, red meat and its subtypes, processed meat and its
subtypes, ﬁsh, and poultry were included as either continuous or categorical
variables. When they were included as continuous variables, the increments
used were 50 g/d for red meat, 25 g/d for processed meat, ﬁsh, poultry, beef,
and pork, 10 g/d for sausages and cold cuts, and 5 g/d for veal, lamb, and
liver p^at´e intakes. When they were included as categorical variables (tertiles
or quartiles), the categorization was based on the intake distribution among
cases. Use of a categorization based on the intake distribution in the entire
cohort to deﬁne categorical variables resulted in similar risk estimates (data
not shown). Lamb, sausage, and liver p^at´e were eaten by only a relatively
small fraction of the cohort, and a large fraction had zero consumption
of these speciﬁc subtypes. For these items, we therefore created indicator
variables reﬂecting nonconsumption.

The linearity of all quantitative variables (exposure and covariate
variables) was graphically evaluated in linear spline models with 3 or 9
boundaries placed at the quartiles or deciles among cases (24). None of
the associations showed signs of deﬂection, and quantitative variables
could be entered linearly into the Cox models (25).

Two-sided 95% CIs for the incidence rate ratios (IRRs) were calculated
based on WaldÕs test of the Cox regression parameter, i.e., on the log rate
ratio scale. The procedure PHREG in SAS (release 9.1; SAS Institute) on a
TextPad platform was used for the statistical analyses.

Results

During a median follow-up of 13.4 y (5th–95th percentile: 4.6–
15.0 y), 644 incident cases of colon cancer and 345 of rectal
cancer were diagnosed. The colon cancer cases comprised 266
cancers of the proximal part of the colon, 328 cancers of the
distal part, and 50 with no deﬁnitive site information. The baseline
characteristics across intake groups of red meat for men and
women separately are shown in Table 1. Both men and women
with the highest reported level of red meat consumption were
more likely to be current smokers, NSAID users, have a higher
waist circumference, and consume more dietary ﬁber and total
energy than those in the lowest intake group; furthermore, men
in the highest intake group consumed more alcohol and women

466 Egeberg et al.

in the highest intake group were less likely to have a high
education and to be physically active than those in the lowest
intake groups.

Table 2 presents the IRRs (95% CI) for colon and rectal
cancers associated with intake of meat. Intake of red meat was
not associated with colon cancer risk. In the analyses of red meat
subtypes, higher intake of lamb was signiﬁcantly associated with
a higher risk for colon cancer, when comparing the highest to the
lowest intake group [adjusted IRRGroup 3 vs. Group 1 for lamb =
1.35 (95% CI: 1.07–1.71); P-trend = 0.01]. This association
persisted in the continuous analysis; for an increment in intake
of 5 g/d of lamb, the adjusted IRR for colon cancer was 1.07
(95% CI: 1.02–1.13). An elevated colon cancer risk was observed
among participants in the highest compared to the lowest intake
group of beef [adjusted IRRGroup 4 vs. Group 1 for beef = 1.30
(95% CI: 1.00–1.70)]; however, the P-trend was not signiﬁcant
(P-trend = 0.33) and there was no association in the continuous
model. In addition, intake of neither pork nor veal was associated
with risk for colon cancer. There were no consistent associations
between intake of processed meat overall or processed meat
subtypes and risk for colon cancer. Furthermore, there was no
evidence of an association between intake of poultry [adjusted
IRRper 25g/d = 1.04 (95% CI: 0.93–1.15)] or of ﬁsh [adjusted
IRRper 25g/d = 0.93 (95% CI: 0.85–1.01)] and colon cancer risk.
Analyses with continuous variables were also performed for
the 2 colon cancer subsites: proximal and distal. No association
was found between intake of overall red meat, overall processed
meat or its subtypes, poultry, or ﬁsh and risk for either proximal
or distal colon cancer (data not shown). For proximal colon
cancer, a higher risk was seen with each increment of intake of 5
g/d of veal [adjusted IRRper 5g/d = 1.14 (95% CI: 1.03–1.26)].
Intake of lamb was signiﬁcantly associated with a higher risk for
distal colon cancer, with an adjusted IRR of 1.11 (95% CI: 1.04–
1.18) for each increment of intake of 5 g/d.

Overall red meat intake was not associated with risk for
rectal cancer. Both intake of beef and pork affected the risk but
in opposite directions: a higher intake of beef was signiﬁcantly
associated with a lower risk for rectal cancer [adjusted IRRper
25g/d = 0.83 (95% CI: 0.70–0.98)], while a higher intake of pork
was signiﬁcantly associated with a higher risk [adjusted IRRper
25g/d = 1.18 (95% CI: 1.02–1.37)]. No association was found
between rectal cancer risk and intake of processed meat or its
subtypes, ﬁsh, or poultry (Table 2).

Neither intake of alcohol nor total dietary ﬁber modiﬁed the
associations between red meat, processed meat, poultry, or ﬁsh
and risks for colon and rectal cancer (all P-interaction > 0.19).
The association between processed meat and colon cancer risk
tended to differ by cereal ﬁber intake (P-interaction = 0.06), the
risk for colon cancer being elevated only among participants
with a low intake (>0 to #8 g/d), but not among those with
higher intakes (>8 g/d). Thus, participants with a low cereal ﬁber
intake had a signiﬁcant, 13% (95% CI: 1.01–1.28) higher risk
for colon cancer per each increment of 25-g/d intake of processed
meat. A higher intake of ﬁsh was associated with a signiﬁcantly
lower risk for colon cancer among people with a low fruit ﬁber
intake [>0 to #2 g/d; adjusted IRRper 25 g/d = 0.77 (95% CI:
0.65–0.90)] but not among those with a higher fruit ﬁber intake
(>2 g/d; P-interaction = 0.01). Dietary ﬁber intake from either
source did not affect the risk for rectal cancer associated with red
meat, processed meat, poultry, or ﬁsh intake (all P-interaction >
0.14).

rectal cancer from the substitution models, representing the risks
for colon or rectal cancer associated with a higher intake of one

Discussion

In this prospective cohort, no signiﬁcant associations between
intake of red meat, processed meat, ﬁsh, or poultry and the risks
for colon or rectal cancer risk were shown. With regard to speciﬁc
red meat subtypes, we found signiﬁcant positive associations
between intake of lamb and risk for colon cancer and intake of
pork and risk for rectal cancer, whereas a higher intake of beef
was associated with a signiﬁcantly lower risk for rectal cancer.
This study also suggests that replacing red meat with ﬁsh, rather

than poultry, is associated with a signiﬁcantly lower risk for
colon cancer.

The strengths of this study include its prospective design, the
availability of comprehensive information about the intake of a
wide range of meats, and detailed information about potential
confounding factors. Follow-up was 99.3%. The potential
limitations include the small numbers of cases of proximal and
distal colon cancer and rectal cancer compared with the consid-
erable number of colon cancer cases. Furthermore, the partic-
ipation rate was 35.5% and participants reported a higher
socioeconomic position than nonparticipants (15); therefore, the
study results may not apply to the entire source population. The
participant self-selection may have resulted in a more homoge-
neous study population with less variation in dietary intake,
including meat, than the source population. Although the FFQ
was validated (19), dietary intake based on FFQs is by deﬁnition
affected by measurement errors and could contribute to expo-
sure misclassiﬁcation. In this study, the problem would have been
of particular concern for meats eaten in small quantities and
sporadically, such as lamb, veal, sausages, and liver p^at ´e. In
addition, dietary intake was assessed only once, at study baseline.
Although we would not expect middle-aged participants to make
major changes in their dietary habits over time, a single FFQ may
not represent long-term diet; therefore, the lack of multiple dietary
assessments during follow-up might have resulted in some degree

of exposure misclassiﬁcation. Such errors are probably non-
differential (due to the study design) and might attenuate true
associations. Lastly, we cannot rule out the possibility of residual
confounding despite our attempts to adjust for several suggested
risk factors for colon and rectal cancer.

We observed no association between intake of red or processed
meat and risk for colon or rectal cancer. These ﬁndings are in
contrast to those of a study within the European Prospective
Investigation into Nutrition and Cancer (EPIC) that included data
from our Danish cohort (only 18% of our cases) and a recent
dose-response meta-analysis of 21 prospective studies (2). In their
meta-analysis, Chan et al. (2) found that intake of red and
processed meat was associated with signiﬁcantly higher (by 17
and 24%, respectively) risks for colon cancer per every 100-g/d
increment in intake; the risks for rectal cancer were elevated
with intake of both red and processed meat, but the associations
did not reach signiﬁcance. Possible explanations for the different
ﬁndings of our study and others may relate to differences in the
study populations, the grouping of meats, or the range of meat
intake. Most of the studies included in the meta-analysis by
Chan et al. (2) were conducted in the US. In the largest cohort,
the NIH-AARP study, in which a positive association was found
between intake of red meat (including processed red meat) and
risk for colorectal cancer, the highest category of daily intake was
61.6 g/1000 kcal (median, ;123 g/d) (12). This is considerably

lower than the intake of our cohort (medians in the highest intake
category, 139 g/d red meat and 57 g/d processed meat). Therefore,
our ﬁndings of no associations are unlikely to be related to low
intakes, although the narrow variation in intakes may be implicated.
Intake of ﬁsh or poultry has not been associated with higher
risks for colon or rectal cancer (1,3,26), consistent with our
ﬁndings. The higher heme iron content of red meat represents
one main difference between red meat and ﬁsh and poultry. Heme
iron is thought to stimulate endogenous formation of NOCs (6),
which are suspected carcinogens (4). Furthermore, heme iron
induces cytotoxicity of colonic content and compensatory hyper-
proliferation of the colonic epithelium (27,28); it also induces
colorectal cancer in rodents (29), may act as a prooxidant, and
may catalyze lipid peroxidation and DNA damage (30). Heme
iron intake has been positively associated with the risk for colorectal
cancer in most (12–14,31) but not all studies (32,33). Although
we found no association between intake of all red meat and risk
for colon cancer, a higher intake of lamb was consistently related
to a higher risk, and an elevated risk for colon cancer was suggested
for high beef consumption. Because heme iron amounts differ in
red meat subtypes, being highest in lamb and beef and lowest in
pork and veal (7), these ﬁndings support a possible role of heme
iron. Few other studies have examined associations of risk with
speciﬁc red meat subtypes. The Netherlands Cohort Study
suggested that intake of beef was related to a higher risk for
colon cancer and intake of pork to a lower risk (9). No association
with beef or pork intake and colon cancer risk was reported in a
Japanese cohort study; however, the very low meat consumption
of the participants might explain this unexpected ﬁnding (8). In
the EPIC study (10), a signiﬁcantly higher risk for colorectal
cancer was found for participants in the group with the highest
intake of pork and a positive association with lamb consumption
was suggested; no association was found with beef or veal
consumption. In the EPIC study, however, the effects of red meat
subtypes were not examined by colorectal cancer subsite or by
country, only EPIC-wide (10). Whereas intake of pork was
associated with a signiﬁcantly higher risk for rectal cancer in our
study, intake of beef was associated with a signiﬁcantly lower
risk. The ﬁnding for beef was unexpected, because beef belongs
to the red meat category not considered preventable. Because we
conducted multiple tests, we cannot rule out chance; however,
this applies to all our results. Also, as mentioned previously, the
small number of rectal cancer cases might have reduced the
power of this analysis. Nevertheless, the risk factors for colon
and rectal cancer may vary, because these structures arise from
different embryonic tissue and serve different functions (34).
Besides heme iron, any effect of meat on risk for colon and
rectal cancer could be associated with exposure to exogenous
NOCs, HCAs, or PAHs (11,12). Whereas exogenous NOCs are
derived mainly from processed meat, HCAs and PAHs occur as a
result of cooking meat at high temperature, over an open ﬂame,
or by certain cooking and smoking methods applied to processed
meat (35–38). We were unable to consider associations between
HCAs and PAHs and risks for colon and rectal cancer, because
we had no data on meat cooking; however, other data indicate
that our cohort might have had high exposure to these compounds.
In an analysis of 24-h dietary recalls by a subsample of our cohort
(7%), high-temperature meat-cooking methods (i.e., frying,
grilling, and barbecuing) were used for 43% of meat and ﬁsh
eaten (39), whereas the reported frequencies in other Europeans
populations range from 11.5 to 46.5% (39). Thus, our overall
ﬁndings are unlikely to be explained by the meat cooking method,
if the mechanism by which red meat affects the risk for colon and
rectal cancer is due to HCAs and PAHs.

The WCRF/AICR recommends dietary changes that focus on
increasing the intake of other sources of meat, such as ﬁsh and
poultry, to prevent cancer (1). Our ﬁnding that the risk for colon
cancer is lowered when red meat is replaced with ﬁsh is in line
with the results of previous prospective studies (40–42). In 2 of
these, the ratio of higher red meat to lower combined poultry
and ﬁsh intake was associated with a higher risk for colorectal
cancer (41,42). Another study found that a 10-g (per 1000 kcal)
higher intake of white meat combined with an equal lower intake
of red meat intake was associated with lower risks for both colon
and rectal cancer (40).

In conclusion, we found no association between intake of red
meat, processed meat, ﬁsh, or poultry and the risk for colon or
rectal cancer. Our study suggests, however, that different types
of red meat differ in their associations with colon cancer risk and
potentially also rectal cancer risk. Further evaluations in larger
studies should be made of the potential associations between types
of red meat and the risks for cancers of the colon and rectum. The
ﬁnding of a lower risk for colon cancer when ﬁsh replaced red
meat underscores the importance of the recommendation of the
WCRF/AICR to replace red meat with other meat sources in the
diet for cancer prevention.
