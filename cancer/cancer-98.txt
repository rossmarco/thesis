The association between meat consumption and risk of
colorectal cancer has been controversial. We examined this
question in a large prospective cohort study in Japan. From
June through August 1990, 47 605 residents, aged 40–64
years, of Miyagi Prefecture in northern Japan completed
a self-administered questionnaire, including a food
frequency questionnaire. In the study population, we
observed 474 incident cases of colorectal cancer during 11
years of follow-up, to March 2001. We used the Cox
proportional hazards model to estimate the relative risk of
colorectal cancer (colorectum, colon, rectum and proximal
colon and distal colon) according to each of the categories
of meat intake (total meat, beef, pork, ham or sausage,
chicken and liver), with adjustment for sex, age and other
potentially confounding variables. The multivariate relative
risk of colorectal cancer in the highest category of total
meat consumption compared with the lowest was 1.14
[95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.85–1.53; P-trend = 0.22].
We also found no significant association between
total meat consumption and the risk of sub-site of

colorectal cancer. In conclusion, our data do not
support the hypothesis that meat consumption is a risk
factor for colorectal cancer. European Journal of Cancer

Introduction
Colorectal cancer was the fourth most common cause of
cancer death in Japanese men (20 265 deaths) and the
second most common cause of cancer death in Japanese
women (16 682 deaths) in 2001. Furthermore, mortality
due to colorectal cancer has been increasing in Japan.
Between 1950 and 2001, the age-adjusted mortality rates
per 100 000 population increased from 2.9 to 14.2 for
colon cancer and from 5.6 to 9.2 for rectal cancer in men,
and from 3.3 to 9.5 for colon cancer in women, but not for
rectal cancer in women (the corresponding rate was from
4.2 to 4.1) (Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare,
Japan, 2002a; Kono, 2004).

In 1997, the World Cancer Research Fund and the
American Institute for Cancer Research examined the
association between diet and colorectal cancer (WCRF/
AICR, 1997). Based on 26 case–control and seven
prospective cohort studies, the report suggested that
red meat
‘possibly’
increased the risk of colorectal cancer. However, some
recent prospective cohort
studies have found null
increased association between meat intake and the risk
of colorectal cancer (Kato et al., 1997; Hsing et al., 1998;
Sellers et al., 1998; Knekt et al., 1999; Pietinen et al., 1999;
0959-8278 c 2006 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins

‘probably’ and processed meat

Flood et al., 2003), although other studies have reported a
positive association of some kind (Gaard et al., 1996;
Singh et al., 1998; English et al., 2004; Wei et al., 2004;
Chao et al., 2005; Larsson et al., 2005). Although
consumption of red meat or processed meat might be
related to the risk of distal colon and rectal cancer, the
association of meat type with colorectal cancer risk by
sub-site has been under discussion (English et al., 2004;
Chao et al., 2005; Larsson et al., 2005). Thus, evidence of
an association between meat consumption and the risk of
colorectal cancer, both overall and by sub-site, has
remained unclear. Most previous studies were conducted
in Western countries, where dietary habits and genetic
background differ from those in Asian countries. To our
knowledge, only one previous prospective cohort study
has been carried out in an Asian country (Hirayama,
1990). The report showed no increased risk of colorectal
cancer mortality with increased meat consumption
(Hirayama, 1990; Truswell, 2002). However, the results
were based on a census, mortality data were used, and the
results reflected lifestyle 40 years previously.

The objective of the present population-based prospec-
tive cohort study was to examine the association between
total meat consumption, and the risk of colorectal cancer

212 European Journal of Cancer Prevention 2006, Vol 15 No 3

in Japan, where mortality rates due to cancers have
increased rapidly in recent years. We further examined
the association between the consumption of different
types of meat and sub-site of the colorectal tract.

Methods
Study cohort
The design of the present cohort study has been
described in detail elsewhere (Fukao et al., 1995; Nakaya
et al., 2003; Sato et al., 2005). Briefly, we delivered a self-
administered questionnaire on various health habits to
51 921 subjects (25 279 men and 26 642 women) aged
40–64 years at the baseline, who lived in 14 munici-
palities of Miyagi Prefecture in rural northern Japan
between June and August 1990. Usable questionnaires
were returned from 47 605 subjects (22 836 men and
24 769 women), yielding a response rate of 91.7%.

The study protocol was approved by the institutional
review board of Tohoku University Graduate School of
Medicine, and we considered return of a signed self-
administered questionnaire to imply each subject’s
consent to participate in the study.

Dietary assessment
We assessed dietary intake with a self-administered
40-item food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). As for
meat, five items (beef, pork, ham or sausage, chicken and
liver) were included in the questionnaire. Thus we used
these five items to assess meat intake in our study, and
calculated the total weight of each type of meat
consumed per day. The questionnaire asked about the
average frequency of consumption of various foods. For
seasonal foods, the subjects were asked to report the
intake frequency during the high season. Five frequency
categories were used for the majority of food items
(almost never, 1–2 times per month, 1–2 times per week,
3–4 times per week, almost every day). We determined
the portion size for each food item based on the median
values observed in 12-day dietary records collected from
sub-samples of the subjects, men and women, separately.
The number of sub-sample subjects was 119 (59 men and
60 women). For subsequent analysis, six subjects who
failed to complete the full 12 days of the dietary record or
the FFQs were excluded, leaving 113 subjects (55 men
and 58 women).

The design of the sub-study has been described in detail
elsewhere (Ogawa et al., 2003). The validity of food
consumption was assessed by calculating Spearman
correlation coefficients between the dietary records and
the FFQs for the relevant factors (Ogawa et al., 2003).
The age-adjusted,
sex-adjusted, energy-adjusted and
de-attenuated Spearman correlation coefficients were
0.18 for total meat consumption and, correspondingly,
0.25 for beef, 0.44 for pork (excluding ham or sausage),

0.38 for ham and sausage, 0.04 for chicken and 0.25
liver. As for beef, we calculated the correlation
for
coefficients without de-attenuation because of
large
within-person to between-person variance in the dietary
records. In addition, the age-adjusted, sex-adjusted and
energy-adjusted Spearman correlation coefficients be-
tween two FFQs administered 1 year apart (which acted
as a measure of reproducibility) was 0.54 for total meat
consumption, and correspondingly 0.67 for beef, 0.50 for
pork (excluding ham or sausage), 0.56 for ham and
sausage, 0.38 for chicken and 0.41 for liver.

Follow-up
We identified cases of colon or rectal cancer that occurred
in our study cohort from the baseline to March 2001 by
linkage of computerized records, using four characteri-
stics (name in Chinese characters (kanji), sex, birthday
and municipality of dwelling), with the Miyagi Prefectural
Cancer Registry, which covers the study area (Nishino
et al., 2004).

Of the 47 605 subjects who responded to the question-
naire, we excluded 1113 subjects with a previous
diagnosis of cancer (including non-melanoma skin cancer)
ascertained either by self-reporting in the health habit
questionnaire or from cancer registry records. We also
excluded 4657 subjects who had extreme levels of energy
intake, probably reflecting careless completion of the
dietary questionnaire (5% below or above of the range for
all subjects).

Consequently, 41 835 subjects (20 174 men and 21 661
women) with 474 colorectal cancers (280 colon cancers,
198 rectal cancers and four cases of colon and rectal
cancer) were included in the present analysis. Cases were
identified by the International Classification of Diseases
code (2nd edition; ICD-O-2); colon (C18.0, C18.2–C18.9)
and rectum (C19.0, C20.9) (Percy et al., 1990).

We counted person-years of follow-up for each subject
from the beginning of follow-up (1 June 1990) until the
date of diagnosis of each colon cancer, the date of death,
the date of moving out of the study area, or the end of the
follow-up period (31 March 2001), whichever occurred
first. The total number of person-years of follow-up
accrued for the colorectal cancer analyses was 431 591.
A total of 1888 subjects (4.5% of the analytical cohort)
were lost of follow-up during the study period.

Statistical analysis
We carried out separate analyses for each site of colorectal
cancers. Daily consumption of total meat was grouped
into quartiles. Energy adjustment of food intake was
performed using the residual method (Willet
and
Stampfer, 1986). For each type of meat, it was difficult
to divide the subjects into adequate quartiles because of

unequal distribution, and therefore we used categories of
frequency. We re-categorized the categories of frequency
from five to four: almost never, 1–2 times per month,
1–2 times per week, or 3–4 times per week or more. We
used the Cox proportional hazards models to calculate
relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for
developing cancer, and to adjust for potentially confound-
ing variables (Rothman et al., 1998). These analyses were
performed using the SAS version 8.2 statistical software
package (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, North Carolina, USA).
The multivariate analyses were adjusted for sex, age (in
years), smoking status (never, past, currently smoking
1 to 19 cigarettes per day, or currently smoking 20 or
more cigarettes per day), alcohol consumption (never,
past, currently drinking 22.7 g or less ethanol per day, or
currently drinking 22.8 g or more ethanol per day), body
mass index in kg/m2 (18.4 or lower, 18.5–24.9, or 25.0 or
higher), education (in school until 15 years of age, from
16 to 18 years of age, or 19 years of age or older), family
history of cancer (presence or absence), time spent
walking (less than 1 h per day, or 1 h or longer per day),
consumption of
fat, calcium and dietary fibre (in
quartiles).

We repeated all analyses after excluding all subjects with
colorectal or each site the cancer diagnosed within the
first 3 years of follow-up; colorectal (81 cases), colon
(45 cases) and rectum (37 cases), and one case diagnosed
with both colon and rectum, in order to eliminate the
possibility that undiagnosed colon or
rectal cancer
present at the baseline might have influenced the results
for meat consumption. For evaluating the risk on a sub-
site specific basis, we analysed 142 cases of proximal
(caecum to splenic flexure) and 100 cases of distal
(descending to sigmoid) colon cancer. The cases of cancer
diagnosed within the first 3 years of follow-up were
proximal colon (17 cases) and distal colon (17 cases).

The P-values for the test of linear trend were calculated
by setting the meat consumption category as an ordinal
variable. All P-values were two-tailed. Differences at
P < 0.05 were accepted as statistically significant.

Results
The baseline characteristics of
subjects
according to quartiles of meat consumption are shown
in Table 1. The median consumption of total meat in this
cohort was 52.1 g/day, and the median values in the lowest
and highest quartiles were 40.3 and 70.4 g/day, respec-
tively. Compared with those in the lowest quartile, those
in the highest quartile were more likely to be men, to be
younger, to have never smoked, to consume less alcohol,
to have a more normal physical constitution, to spend less
time walking, to have been educated to a high level, and
to consume more fat, calcium and dietary fibre. No
appreciable difference was observed in family history.

We conducted stratified analyses of
colorectal cancer according to sex, 10-year age class,
smoking status, alcohol consumption, body mass index,
education, family history of cancer, time spent walking,
and consumption of
fat, calcium and dietary fibre.
However, the associations between meat consumption
and the risk of colorectal cancer were not significantly
modified by any of these variables (data not shown).

Table 2 presents the relative risk for colorectal cancer and
each site of colorectal cancer according to quartiles of
meat consumption. Increased meat consumption was not
associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer. The
age-adjusted and sex-adjusted RR for the highest versus
the lowest quartiles for meat consumption was 1.15
(95% CI = 0.89–1.49; P-trend = 0.14) for colorectal cancer,
1.23 (95% CI = 0.87–1.73; P-trend = 0.11) for colon cancer
and 1.01 (95% CI = 0.68–1.50; P-trend = 0.86) for rectal
cancer. Neither multivariate adjustments nor the exclu-
sion of subjects with total or each site of colorectal cancer
diagnosed during the first 3 years of follow-up yielded any
substantial changes to the findings. For proximal colon
cancer, we found no significant association with meat
consumption, or any linear trend. For distal colon cancer,
point estimates of multivariate RR increased, but they
did not reach statistically significant levels. In addition,
no statistically significant linear trend was observed
(P-trend = 0.14). When men and women were analysed
separately, the quartiles being based on sex-specific levels
of intake, we did not observe an apparent association
between risk of colorectal cancer, either as a whole or by
sub-site, and total meat consumption (data not shown).

We further examined associations between the consump-
tion of five specific types of meat (beef, pork, ham or
sausage, chicken, and liver) and the risks of colorectal
cancer and by sub-site (Table 3). A certain type of meat
showed a significant dose–response relationship for colon
cancer
there was no
significant relationship overall between meat type and

Discussion
In this population-based prospective cohort study in
Japan, we found no significant associations between meat
consumption and the risk of colorectal cancer. Moreover,
meat consumption was not significantly associated with
the risk of cancer in either colon or rectum. We also
investigated intake of various types of meat. No specific
meat type showed a dose–response relationship to the
risk of colorectal cancer, but intake of chicken showed a
significant dose–response relationship to the risk of colon
cancer (P-trend = 0.03).

Several recent prospective cohort studies have investi-
gated the association between meat intake and the risk of

English et al., 2004; Wei et al., 2004; Chao et al., 2005;
Larsson et al., 2005). Two of four studies conducted in
northern Europe reported no association (Knekt et al.,
1999; Pietinen et al., 1999). However, US studies have
often shown some association (Singh et al., 1998; Wei
et al., 2004; Chao et al. 2005). Chao et al., (2005) suggested
that European studies have reported no association of
colorectal cancer with total meat consumption, but
positive associations with processed meat consumption.
The ratio of each meat type to total meat would give a
different result. Among studies that excluded ‘processed
meat’ from ‘total red meat’, European subjects consumed
more ‘processed meat’ or ‘sausage’ than ‘beef and pork (or
lamb)’ (Pietinen et al., 1999), whereas US subjects
showed an opposite tendency (Wei et al., 2004). In our

The amount of meat consumed is an important point
when referring to other studies. The median consump-
tion of total meat in the present cohort was 52.1 g/day,
and the median values in the lowest and highest quartiles
were 40.3 and 70.4 g/day, respectively. Therefore there
was a 1.7-fold difference across the meat consumption
quartiles in our subjects. A study of a US population,
which suggested a positive association between meat
consumption and colorectal cancer, reported a wide range
of meat consumption with a difference of over 10-fold
(Chao et al., 2005). Also, in our study, a few subjects
reported eating meat ‘almost every day’. Most of the
subjects reported their intake as ‘1–2 times/month’ or
‘1–2 times/week’, in contrast to Western subjects, many
of whom consumed meat
‘5 or more times/week’

*Reference category. RR: relative risk. RR1: the multivariate relative risk with all cases of colorectal or each site of colorectal cancer in analysis. RR2: the multivariate
relative risk with cases diagnosed in the first 3 years of follow-up excluded from analysis. Values in parentheses are 95% confidence intervals. Total meat included five
items: beef, pork (excluding ham or sausage), ham or sausage, chicken, and liver. Multivariate models included sex; age (in years); smoking status (never, past, currently
smoking 1–19 cigarettes per day, or currently smoking more over 20 cigarettes per day); alcohol consumption (never, past, currently drinking 22.7 g or less ethanol per
day, or currently drinking 22.8 g or more ethanol per day); body mass index in kg/m2 (18.4 or lower, 18.5–24.9, or 25.0 or higher); education (in school until 15 years of
age, from 16 to 18 years, or 19 years or older); family history of cancer (presence or absence); time spent walking (less than 1 h per day, or 1 h or longer per day);
consumption of fat, calcium, and dietary fibre (in quartiles).

(Wei et al., 2004). Thus, there is a possibility that the
comparatively low meat consumption among our subjects
may not have been enough to produce strong and positive
effects.

Our study had some methodological strengths. As for
selection bias, selection of participants had a low degree
of bias because the rate of response to the questionnaire
was high (91.7%). Potential diet recall bias was avoided in
this study because the intake data were collected before
colorectal cancer was diagnosed. Our study used cancer
incidence data by linkage of highly precise records with
the Miyagi Prefectural Cancer Registry. Meanwhile, we
should also consider some methodological weaknesses of
the present study. Some misclassification of exposure
would have been unavoidable because meat consumption
was estimated by self-reported questionnaire. The
validation of meat consumption indicated a moderate
level in some, but not as a whole. Thus, misclassification
of subjects might be considered inevitable. A possible
reason for the low correlation for some meat items may be
the lack of variation in the questionnaire responses owing
to a limited number of frequency categories, for liver as
an example, the majority of subjects (approximately

60.0%) chose the lowest category (‘almost never’).
Nevertheless, because the information on meat intake
was collected before subjects developed colorectal cancer
and other serious disease, the misclassification of meat
intake would have likely been non-differential, and
resulting in conservative estimates for the association
between meat intake and the risk of colorectal cancer.

The risk of colon cancer may differ according to sub-site
(Inoue et al., 1995; Iacopetta, 2002; English et al., 2004;
Wei et al., 2004; Chao et al., 2005; Larsson et al., 2005).
We investigated the association between total meat
consumption and sub-site-specific risk of colon cancer.
Although there was no significant linear association
between total meat consumption and proximal or distal
colon cancer, we could not fully exclude the possibility of
a positive association between total meat consumption
and distal colon cancer because point estimates of RR
were increased, although not to a significant degree.

For certain types of meat, such as beef and chicken, we
found some significant association with the risk of colon
cancer, or distal colon cancer. As for chicken, these results
were unexpected because they were not in agreement

*Reference category. RR: relative risk. Values in parentheses are 95% confidence intervals. Energy intakes were adjusted as continuous variable in all of analysis.
Multivariate models were adjusted for variables denoted in Table 2. Subjects who gave no response to the frequency of consumption of each meat type were excluded
from the analysis item by item. As for beef and liver, there were few cases of colorectal cancer in the ‘3–4 times/week or more’ category, so we combined the cases with
‘1–2 times/week’ to calculate relative risks.

with those of recent prospective cohort studies (Chao
et al., 2005; Larsson et al., 2005). One interpretation is
that this increased risk occurred by chance because the
RR did not increase linearly. Another interpretation is
that the statistical power was insufficient when analysis
was done according to the sub-site of colon cancer.

that might

The biological mechanisms by which meat might increase
the risk of colorectal cancer have been discussed for years
(WCRF/AICR, 1997; Bingham 1999; Potter 1999; Norat
et al., 2002; Cross et al., 2003). Most concern has been
focused on the type of meat (especially red meat and
processed meat) and the method used for processing and
cooking it. Some biological studies have reported that fat
intake and the fat content of red meat could influence
the risk of colorectal cancer (Chomchai et al., 1974;
Narisawa et al., 1974; Mastromorino et al., 1976; Reddy
et al., 1980), although epidemiological studies have failed
to demonstrate a consistent relationship (Giovannucci
et al., 1997; WCRF/AICR, 1997; Potter, 1999; Kono, 2004).
Specific substances
such as heterocyclic amines or
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in well-done meat, and
also N-nitroso compounds in processed meat, have been a
focus of constant attention as possible mutagens and
carcinogens
cancer
(Bingham et al., 1996; Singh et al., 1998; Knekt et al.,
1999; Norat et al., 2002). However, the epidemiological
evidence is weak (Norat et al., 2002; Larsson et al., 2005)
and the distribution of these substances does not differ
from that in fresh meat (Knekt et al., 1999). Unfortu-
nately, we did not have any information about exposure in
our study. Furthermore, these substances would not have
made a great contribution to our study subjects because
the amounts of meat or meat products they consumed
were very low in comparison with the amount consumed
by Western people. Another possibly relevant substance is
iron, especially heme iron, as it may enhance the
production of free oxygen radicals, and a high concentra-
tion of heme iron in the colorectum may increase the risk
of colorectal cancer (Siegers et al., 1991; Nelson, 1992;
Knekt et al., 1994; Wurzelmann et al., 1996; Doyle et al.,
1999; Liu et al., 2003; Larsson et al., 2004; Milman et al.,
2004). Intake of heme iron appears to be associated with
increased risk of distal colon and rectum cancer (Larsson
et al., 2004), or of proximal colon cancer (Lee et al., 2004),
although the data were obtained in two studies that
examined postmenopausal women. Further investigations
on the association between heme iron and colorectal
cancer risk are needed.

Some studies of Japanese populations have reported a risk
of colorectal cancer related to meat (Tajima et al., 1985;
Hirayama, 1990; Kono et al., 1993; Inoue et al., 1995),
although the results were inconsistent. The dietary habits
of Japanese have gradually become more Westernized and
this has led to an increase of meat intake (Matsumura,

Meat consumption and colorectal cancer risk Sato et al. 217

2001; Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, Japan,
2002b). Nevertheless, we found no association between
meat intake and the risk of colorectal cancer.

In summary, we have found no association between the
consumption of meat and the risks of colon and rectal
cancers in Japan. The findings are in general agreement
with the results of several similarly designed studies from
Western countries, and provide further evidence to clarify
the relationship between meat consumption and colo-
rectal cancer.
