ABSTRACT To examine the effect of food restriction on immune functions in the tumor-bearing state, mice were
divided into a control group (fed 5.0 g diet/d; 71 kJ/d) and a 60% food-restricted group (fed 3.0 g diet/d; 43 kJ/d)
at 8-wk of age, and 4 wk later, L1210 tumor cells were inoculated intradermally. In the food-restricted mice, tumor
growth was signiﬁcantly suppressed, and mean survival time after the tumor inoculation was prolonged (P ⬍ 0.05).
The plasma concentrations of two antitumor cytokines, interferon-␥ (IFN-␥) and tumor necrosis factor-␣ (TNF-␣),
were greater in the food-restricted group before tumor inoculation (P ⬍ 0.05). Furthermore, the food-restricted mice
had signiﬁcantly higher plasma levels of IFN-␥ and TNF-␣ after tumor inoculation, although the treatment
signiﬁcantly increased these cytokine levels in both groups. Splenic natural killer cell cytotoxicity was also higher
in the tumor-bearing food-restricted mice than in controls (P ⬍ 0.05). Food-restricted mice have strong antitumor
immunity, and as a result, tumor growth is suppressed and survival time is prolonged in these mice. J. Nutr. 130:

Food restriction (FR)2 prolongs the mean and maximal life
spans of rats, mice and other species (Cheney et al. 1980,
Comfort 1963, Ross 1961, Weindruch and Walford 1988). In
addition, FR of rodents results in a reduced incidence and
delayed onset of tumors and other age-associated diseases
(Weindruch 1989, Yu et al. 1982).

FR results in the activation of cellular immunity, altered
subsets of T cells (Gartner et al. 1992), enhanced responses of
T cells to mitogens and interleukin-2 (Hishinuma et al. 1990),
and altered production of antibodies and interleukin-2 (Spear-
Hartley and Sherman 1994). It has been proposed that host
immune surveillance mechanisms effectively suppress the in-
cidence of tumors in FR animals (Konno et al. 1991). FR also
has been shown to greatly reduce white blood cell (WBC)
number, particularly the lymphocyte count (Kubo et al. 1984).
Although mechanisms by which FR reduces WBC number
have not yet been clariﬁed, it has been reported that the
incidence of leukemia is lowered in FR mice due to the
reduction of leukocytes (Volk et al. 1994). Moreover, strong
immune responses and a high resistance to developing spon-
taneous tumors in FR mice are thought to be closely related to
the reduction of lymphocyte number (Weindruch and Walford
1988).

Effects of FR on immune functions in tumor-bearing ani-
mals have not yet been well elucidated so we inoculated L1210

tumor cells intradermally into 60% FR mice, and studied host
immune functions after the tumor inoculation.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Animals. Male BDF1 mice (5-wk-old) were obtained from Clea
(Osaka, Japan). These mice had free access to water and to a diet
reported by Konno et al. (1991), which was composed of 20% casein,
64% potato starch, 5% soybean oil, 5% cellulose powder, 4% salt
mixture and 2% vitamin mixture.3 These mice were kept at con-
trolled temperature (23 ⫾ 2°C), humidity (60 ⫾ 10%) and lighting
(12-h light and 12-h dark cycle), and housed individually. When
8-wk-old, mice were randomly divided into control and 60% FR
groups. Mice in the control group were fed 5.0 g of the diet daily (71
kJ/d), whereas 60% FR mice received 3.0 g (43 kJ/d). All experimen-
tal procedures involving laboratory animals were approved by the
Animal Care and Use Committee of Osaka Prefecture University.

Inoculation of tumor cells. L1210 leukemia cells (America Type
Culture Collection, CCL219), obtained from Riken Cell Bank
(Tsukuba, Japan), were maintained in Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle’s
medium, supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and
10 mmol/L HEPES. At 12 wk of age (4 wk after the initiation of FR),

TNF-␣ data, values were logarithmically transformed to improve
normality and to compensate for unequal variance, and were analyzed
by two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s test. All data are shown as
means ⫾ SD, and statistical signiﬁcance is deﬁned as P ⬍ 0.05.

RESULTS

When FR was started in BDF1 mice at 8 wk of age, body
weight was signiﬁcantly lowered within 1 wk and at 12 wk of
age, the weight in the FR group was about 75% (P ⬍ 0.05) of
that in the control (Fig. 1). The FR-induced body weight
change observed in this experiment is consistent with previous
reports (Hishinuma et al. 1988, Konno et al. 1991). Tumors
appeared at the site of the inoculation in both the FR and
control groups by 2 wk after the treatment (at 12 wk), and the
tumors progressively grew thereafter. However, the rate of the
tumor growth was signiﬁcantly slower in the FR group, and 3.5
wk (25 d) after the inoculation, tumor weight in the FR mice
was ⬍ 30% (P ⬍ 0.05) of that in controls (Fig. 2A). A
signiﬁcant difference was also seen in survival curves between
the FR and control groups (Fig. 2B). Mean survival time after
tumor inoculation in the control group was 30.7 d, and all
control mice died by 35 d. In contrast, in the FR group, the
mean survival time was prolonged to 38.5 d (P ⬍ 0.05), and
the ﬁnal mouse survived until 54 d.

Although red blood cell number was not different between

divided into control (5 g of a diet/d; 71 kJ/d) and 60% FR (3 g of a diet/d;
43 kJ/d) groups, and 4 wk later these mice were inoculated with L1210
tumor cells by intradermal injection. Values are means ⫾ SD, n ⫽ 7. *: P

mice in both the FR and control groups were inoculated with L1210
by intradermal injection of ⬃10 6 cells. For determination of tumor
growth, 2, 3 and 3.5 wk after the inoculation these mice (seven mice
in each group at each time point) were anesthetized with ethyl ether,
and tumors in these mice were isolated and weighed.

Determination of leukocyte, lymphocyte, neutrophil and mono-
cyte counts. Mice (ﬁve mice in each group) were anesthetized with
ethyl ether, and blood was collected by cardiac puncture. Blood
samples (10% in an EDTA solution) were incubated on ice until
measured with an automatic blood corpuscle count apparatus (Sys-
mex K-1000; Toua Iyou Electric, Kobe, Japan). For investigation of
differential counts, blood smears were prepared on microscope slides,
and the slides were air-dried and stained by a modiﬁed Giemsa
method (Seki et al. 1981). Leukocytes (over 200 cells) on the slides
were examined and the percentages of lymphocytes, neutrophils and
monocytes were determined.

Determination of plasma cytokine levels. Blood was collected by
cardiac puncture, and plasma interferon-␥ (IFN-␥) and tumor necro-
sis factor-␣ (TNF-␣) levels were determined by enzyme-linked im-
munosorbent assay methods using commercial kits (QuantikineTM M
Mouse IFN-␥ Immunoassay and QuantikineTM M Mouse TNF-␣
Immunoassay; R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN).

Cytotoxicity assay for natural killer (NK) cells. Spleen cells
were prepared according to a published method (Weindruch et al.
1983). NK-sensitive YAC-1 cells were used as target cells for the
assay of NK cell cytotoxicity. Spleen and target cells were co-cultured
in a 96-well microtiter plate at the effector to target ratio of 100:1 for
4 h at 37°C in 5% CO2, and NK cell cytotoxicity was measured by a
lactate dehydrogenase-release method using a commercial kit (Cyto-
Tox 96® Non-Radioactive Cytotoxicity Assay; Promega, Madison,
WI) according to manufacturer’s instructions.

Statistical analysis. Statistical analyses were performed with
GB-Stat 5.4 (Dynamic Microsystems, Sliver Spring, MD). Body
weights were compared between the FR and control groups during the
experiment by two-way ANOVA for repeated measures, and post-hoc
analyses were done by Tukey’s method. Mean survival time after the
tumor inoculation, and lymphocyte, neutrophil and monocyte counts
were compared between the two groups by one-way ANOVA fol-
lowed by Scheffe´ post-hoc test. Effects of FR on tumor growth, WBC
number and NK cell activity were evaluated by two-way ANOVA,
and multiple comparisons were done by Tukey’s test. For IFN-␥ and

the control and FR groups (data not shown), WBC number
was 45% lower (P ⬍ 0.05) in the FR mice (Fig. 3), as reported
previously (Kubo et al. 1984). Tumor cell inoculation did not
affect WBC number in either group and the number was
signiﬁcantly lower in the FR mice even 3.5 wk after inocula-
tion. Lymphocytes and neutrophils were reduced in the FR
group, compared to the controls, in the tumor-bearing state
(P ⬍ 0.05) (Table 1).

Before tumor inoculation, plasma IFN-␥ concentration in
the FR mice was higher than that in the control (P ⬍ 0.05).
When L1210 tumor cells were implanted, a signiﬁcant eleva-
tion in the plasma IFN-␥level occurred which peaked at 3 wk
in both groups (Fig. 4A). However, the FR mice had a higher
plasma IFN-␥concentration even after the tumor inoculation,
and at the peak, the level in the FR mice was about 3.5-fold
greater than that in the controls (P ⬍ 0.05). The plasma
TNF-␣ concentration also was signiﬁcantly augmented by FR
in the nontumor-bearing mice (Fig. 4B). Furthermore, 3.5 wk
after tumor inoculation, plasma TNF-␣ concentration in the
FR mice was also higher (about 2.5-fold greater) than that in
the control (P ⬍ 0.05), although the tumor inoculation sig-
niﬁcantly increased the TNF-␣ level even in the control
group.

FIGURE 4 Changes in plasma interferon-␥ (IFN-␥) (A) and tumor
necrosis factor-␣ (TNF-␣) (B) levels after tumor inoculation in food-
restricted (FR) mice. FR and control mice at 12-wk-old were inoculated
with L1210 tumor cells, and changes in plasma IFN-␥and TNF-␣levels
were examined. Values are means ⫾ SD, n ⫽ 5. *: P ⬍ 0.05 compared

compared with wk 0.

Before inoculation, there was no signiﬁcant difference be-
tween the FR and control groups in NK cell cytotoxicity (Fig.
5). However, tumor inoculation signiﬁcantly augmented NK
cell cytotoxicity in the FR mice, but not in the control mice.
Thus, at 3.5 wk after inoculation, NK cell cytotoxicity was
greater in FR mice than in control mice (P ⬍ 0.05).

DISCUSSION

It has been shown that FR prevents the occurrence of
late-life spontaneous tumor development and reduces the in-
cidence of tumors induced by radiation or chemical carcino-
gens (Higami et al. 1995, Kolaja et al. 1996, Yoshida et al.
1997). In addition, it has been proposed that these effects of
FR on the onset of tumors are due to the activation of host
immune surveillance mechanisms (Konno et al. 1991, Wein-
druch et al. 1986). Our present data obtained in mice inocu-
lated with L1210 tumor cells show that the growth of the
implanted tumor is signiﬁcantly suppressed in 60% FR mice,
and survival time is longer in these mice (Fig. 2).

In the tumor-bearing state, it has been shown that tumor-
primed CD4⫹ T cells are activated to produce IFN-␥
(Yamamoto et al. 1995). IFN-␥ possesses an antiproliferative
activity against many transformed cell lines in addition to its
antiviral and immunoregulatory functions (Abe et al. 1998,
Giovarelli et al. 1986, Stark et al. 1998). TNF-␣, which was

particularly lymphocytes (Kubo et al. 1984, Weindruch and
Walford 1988). In our study, tumor inoculation did not sig-
niﬁcantly change total WBC number in either the 60% FR or
control groups, and lymphocyte number in the FR mice was
signiﬁcantly lower even in the tumor-bearing state. It has been
shown that FR induces apoptosis, and immune organs, such as
spleen and thymus, are comparatively more sensitive to apop-
tosis than other organs (Keusch et al. 1983). Thus, the low
lymphocyte count in FR mice may be closely related to apop-
tosis in spleen and thymus. Energy restriction has been sug-
gested to enhance T cell function in aged mice by maintaining
apoptosis at levels found in younger mice, thereby removing
non- or poorly functioning T cells (Spaulding et al. 1997). It
is thus thought that immunologically less effective T cells are
eliminated in the FR mice, presumably by apoptosis, even in
the tumor-bearing state. Since CD4⫹ T cells participate in the
production of IFN-␥ in tumor-bearing mice (Yamamoto et al.
1995), the elimination of nonfunctional T cells may be one of
the important factors in improving antitumor immunity in the
FR mice.

originally deﬁned by its antitumor activity in vitro and in vivo
(Carswell et al. 1975, Feinman et al. 1987, Sugarman et al.
1985), has been reported to be mainly produced by macro-
phages after stimulation with IFN-␥ (Collart et al. 1986,
Celada and Maki 1991, Han et al. 1990). L1210 leukemia
cells, which were used in this experiment, are insensitive to
TNF-␣ cytolysis in vitro (Leu et al. 1991), whereas the IFN-␥
receptor is expressed in this cell line (Wietzerbin et al. 1986).
It has also been reported that macrophage-mediated cytotox-
icity of L1210 cells is augmented by IFN-␥ in synergy with
interleukin-2 or lipopolysaccharide in vitro, and TNF-␣ par-
ticipates in the cytotoxic mechanism to produce nitric oxide
by an autocrine mechanism in macrophages (Jiang et al.
1992). Our data (Fig. 4) indicate that in the normal state,
IFN-␥ and TNF-␣ levels are signiﬁcantly greater in the 60%
FR group compared to the control. Furthermore, the FR mice
have greater abilities to produce IFN-␥ and TNF-␣ even after
inoculation of L1210 tumor cells, although this treatment
increases cytokine production in both FR and control groups.
We contend the activated production of IFN-␥and TNF-␣in
FR mice is related closely to the effective suppression of tumor
growth. However, detailed mechanisms by which IFN-␥ and
TNF-␣ production are stimulated by FR are unclear. It has
been reported that the CD4⫹ T cell subpopulation is aug-
mented in FR mice in both the normal and tumor-bearing
states (Gartner et al. 1992, Volk et al. 1994).

NK cells are important antitumor effectors both in vitro
and in vivo (Herberman 1985, Ortaldo and Herberman 1984),
and high NK cell cytotoxicity has been associated with reduc-
tions in tumor development (Reisenfeld et al. 1980). In the
60% FR group, but not in the control group, NK cell cytotox-
icity was signiﬁcantly augmented by the tumor inoculation
(Fig. 5), suggesting that NK cells improve antitumor immunity
in the FR mice. Since activated NK cells can produce IFN-␥
and TNF-␣ (Perussia 1991), it is thought that NK cells par-
ticipate in the active production of IFN-␥ and TNF-␣ in the
tumor-bearing FR mice.

It has been reported that FR reduces leukocyte number
