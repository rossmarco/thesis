ABSTRACT Red meat intake is associated with colon cancer risk. Puzzlingly, meat does not promote
carcinogenesis in rat studies. However, we demonstrated previously that dietary heme promotes aberrant
crypt foci (ACF) formation in rats given a low-calcium diet. Here, we tested the hypothesis that heme-rich
meats promote colon carcinogenesis in rats treated with azoxymethane and fed low-calcium diets (0.8 g/kg).
Three meat-based diets were formulated to contain varying concentrations of heme by the addition of raw
chicken (low heme), beef (medium heme), or black pudding (blood sausage; high heme). The no-heme control
diet was supplemented with ferric citrate and the heme control diet with hemoglobin to match iron and heme
concentrations in the beef diet, respectively. After 100 d, colons were scored for ACF and mucin-depleted foci
(MDF). Fecal water was assayed for lipoperoxides and cytotoxicity. Only diets with heme promoted the
formation of MDF, but all meat diets promoted ACF formation. The number of MDF/colon was 0.55 ⫾ 0.68 in
controls, but 1.2 ⫾ 0.6 (P ⫽ 0.13), 1.9 ⫾ 1.4 (P ⬍ 0.01), and 3.0 ⫾ 1.2 (P ⬍ 0.001) in chicken-, beef-, and black
pudding–fed rats. MDF promotion by the high-heme black pudding diet was greater than that by the
medium-heme beef diet. The number of ACF/colon was 72 ⫾ 16 in controls, but 91 ⫾ 18, 100 ⫾ 13, and 103
⫾ 14 in chicken-, beef-, and black pudding–fed rats (all P ⬍ 0.001). ACF and MDF did not differ between rats
fed the beef diet and those fed the heme control diet. MDF promotion was correlated with high fecal water
lipoperoxides and cytotoxicity (r ⫽ 0.65, P ⬍ 0.01). This is the ﬁrst study to show the promotion of
experimental carcinogenesis by dietary meat and the association with heme intake.

Colorectal cancer is a major cause of death in afﬂuent
countries, and recommendations are to reduce red meat
intake to reduce the risk (1). A meta-analysis of epidemi-
ological studies by Norat et al. (2) found a moderate but
signiﬁcant association between red meat intake and colo-
rectal cancer risk. In puzzling contrast with epidemiological
studies, experimental studies do not support the hypothesis
that red meat increases colorectal cancer risk. Among the
12 rodent studies reported in the literature, none demon-
strated a speciﬁc promotional effect of red meat (3–14).
McIntosh et al. (3) showed that rats given a diet containing
kangaroo meat, soybean protein, or casein have a similar
incidence of dimethylhydrazine-induced tumors. Clinton et
al. (4) also found the colon tumor incidence to be the same
for beef meat–(raw or grilled) and soybean diet–fed rats.

Nutter et al. (5) found beef proteins to afford signiﬁcant
protection from colon cancer in mice compared with milk
protein. Reddy et al. (6) and Pence et al. (7) found high-
protein and high-fat diets, whatever the protein source, to
increase colon tumor incidence in rats, but beef meat had a
greater protective effect than casein (7). Pence et al. (8)
found that well-cooked beef meat decreased the risk of
colon cancer compared to casein in rats fed a high-fat diet
but increased the risk in those fed a low-fat diet. Lai et al.
(9) found that a lean beef diet did not increase tumor
incidence in rats compared with a casein-iron citrate diet.
Alink et al. (10) showed that human diets containing meat
produced more colon carcinomas in rats than diets that did
not include meat. These results do not support speciﬁc meat
promotion, however, because the human diets contained
more fat and less ﬁber than the rat diets. Mutanen et al.
(11) did not ﬁnd a diet of beef meat to increase substantially
the number of intestinal tumors in Min mice, although it
contained 5 times more fat than the control diet. Kettunen
et al. (12) found fewer tumors in female Min mice fed beef
meat than in controls. Parnaud et al. (13) did not ﬁnd red
meat to promote azoxymethane-induced aberrant crypt foci

(ACF) formation compared to casein-fed controls. Belobraj-
dic et al. (14) found kangaroo meat to promote aberrant
crypt foci (ACF)4 formation in comparison with whey pro-
tein, but whey is known to protect against colon carcino-
genesis (15).

Sesink et al. (16) speculated that heme, found in red meat
myoglobin, would enhance colon carcinogenesis. They dem-
onstrated that pure hemin added to rats diet increases colonic
epithelial proliferation and that calcium phosphate inhibits
the hemin-induced proliferation (17). In line with Sesink’s
hypothesis, we showed that hemin diets increase the number
and size of azoxymethane-induced ACF in rats fed a low-
calcium diet, while hemoglobin diets increase ACF number
only (18). Dietary hemin also produces cytotoxic fecal water
and high amounts of TBARS, indicative of lumen lipoperoxi-
dation (16), while dietary hemoglobin increases fecal TBARS
only (18). ACF are putative preneoplastic lesions, and the
effect of agents on ACF is correlated with the effect on tumor
incidence in most (19) but not all studies. Recently, alterna-
tive short-term biomarkers of colon carcinogenesis were pro-
posed: mucin-depleted foci (MDF) (20). MDF are easy to score
and may predict tumor outcome better than ACF (20,21).

The present study was designed to test the hypothesis that
heme in the food matrix can promote colon carcinogenesis.
The diets used in previous animal studies (3–13) contained
high levels of calcium; we supposed that calcium inhibited the
promoting effect of red meat. Three types of meat were chosen
with different heme contents: chicken, beef, and black pud-
ding. A fourth diet, containing pure hemoglobin, was included
as a control that contained the same concentration of heme as
the beef diet. The myoglobin in beef is very close in structure
to hemoglobin.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Animals. Sixty Fisher 344 female rats were purchased at 4 wk of
age from Iffa Credo. Animal care was in accordance with the guide-
lines of the European Council on animals used in experimental
studies. They were distributed randomly in pairs into stainless-steel
wire-bottom cages. The room was kept at a temperature of 22°C on
a 12-h light-dark cycle. Rats were allowed 7 d of acclimatization to
the room and to the control diet (Table 1) before being injected i.p.
with the carcinogen azoxymethane (Sigma Chemical, 20 mg/kg body
wt) in NaCl (9 g/L). Seven days after the injection the rats were
allowed free access to their respective diets for 100 d. Feed was
changed every 2 or 3 d and water once a week. Body weights were
monitored weekly. Feed intake per cage of 2 rats was also monitored
at periodic intervals (d 5, 62, and 77). Fecal mass was measured as the
total over a 24-h period per 2 rats on d 56, 61, 62, 76, and 77.

Diets. Experimental diets, as shown in Table 1, were based on
the diet fed to control rats (n ⫽ 20 rats) consisting of a modiﬁed
AIN-76 diet (22) prepared and formulated in a powdered form by the
UPAE (INRA). Dibasic calcium phosphate was included at a low
concentration of 2.7 g/kg. Three meat diets given to 3 groups of rats
(n ⫽ 10 rats/group) were formulated to contain varying concentra-
tions of heme as hemoglobin or myoglobin by the addition of freeze-
dried beef, chicken, or black pudding at 600 g/kg meat of the total
diet. The beef and chicken (skinless) meat was obtained from UPAE.
Meat was freeze-dried by LyoFal. The beef contained 0.6 ␮mol/g of
heme while none was detected in the chicken diet (see the assay
below). The low fat black pudding (blood sausage) contained 16
␮mol/g of heme. It was specially made by Recape with 90% pork
blood and 10% starch (w:w) and contained no potentially protective
additives such as onion or milk. One group of rats (n ⫽ 10) received

3 All diets contained 140 mg/kg iron except the black pudding diet
(950 mg/kg). Iron concentration was measured in freeze-dried meat
before the diets were prepared: chicken: 37.5, beef: 172.6, and black
pudding 1527 mg/kg. Other nutrients were balanced: 50% protein,
20% fat, 18 –25% carbohydrate, and 0.8 g/kg calcium (based on added
components, no analysis was done on whole diets).

a hemoglobin diet containing the same concentration of heme as the
beef diet (0.36 ␮mol/g diet). This was achieved by adding powdered
bovine hemoglobin (Sigma Chemical) to the control diet. All diets
were balanced for protein (50%), fat (20%), calcium (0.8 g/kg), and
iron (0.14 g/kg) by the addition of casein, lard, calcium phosphate,
and ferric citrate. However, the black pudding died could not be
balanced for iron (0.95 g/kg). The diets were prepared twice a month
and maintained at ⫺20°C. A TBARS assay showed no lipoperoxi-
dation (data not shown).

ACF and MDF assays. All rats were killed by CO2 asphyxiation
in a random order on d 99 or 100. Colons were coded and then scored
for ACF by Bird’s procedure (23). ACF scoring was done in duplicate
by 2 investigators who did not know the treatment group. After being
scored for ACF, colons were stained with the high-iron diamine-
Alcian blue procedure (HID-AB) to evaluate mucin production (20).
MDF number and the number of crypts per MDF were scored by a
single reader, who did not know the rat treatment or the ACF results,
under a light microscope at 32X magniﬁcation. Lesions were identi-
ﬁed as MDF by the absence or very small production of mucins and
by at least 2 of the following criteria outlined by Caderni et al. (20):
multiplicity higher than 3 crypts, distortion of the lumen of the
crypts, and elevation of the lesion in comparison to normal mucosa.
All lesions were photographed (Fig. 1), and representative pictures
were mailed to Dr. Giovanna Caderni (University of Florence, Italy)
for conﬁrmation.

Preparation of fecal water, assay of TBARS, and heme. For
assay of TBARS, heme, and cytotoxic activity on CMT93, fecal water
was prepared from feces collected for 24 h under each cage of 2 rats,
as previously described (18), but black pudding samples were diluted
twice more than the other samples. For assay of cytolytic activity on
erythrocytes, fecal water was prepared by Sesink’s procedure and pH
was measured (16). TBARS were measured in fecal water according
to Ohkawa et al. (24), exactly as previously described (18). Heme
contents of freeze-dried feces and of fecal water were measured by
ﬂuorescence according to Van den Berg et al. (25) and Sesink et al.
(16), respectively, as already described (18).

Cytolytic assay of fecal water. The cytotoxicity of fecal water
was quantiﬁed by 2 methods, on erythrocytes and on a cell line. First,

d 30. The ﬁnal body weight of beef-fed rats was greater than
that of controls (P ⬍ 0.05, Table 2). Black pudding–fed rats
had watery stools, a known effect of dietary heme, and they
drank more water than controls (22 ⫾ 1 mL/d vs. 16 ⫾ 0.5
mL/d, P ⬍ 0.001). Furthermore, all groups had similar food
intakes; at day 75, intake was 8.4 ⫾ 0.5 g/d (full data not
shown).

ACF. All meat-based diets (chicken, beef, and black
pudding) increased the number of ACF (P ⬍ 0.001, Fig. 2A)
and the number of aberrant crypts per colon (P ⬍ 0.001, Table
2) after 100 d. Chicken and black pudding, but not beef, also
increased the number of crypts per ACF (P ⬍ 0.01, Table 2).
Aberrant crypts and ACF promotion by the black pudding diet
were more potent than promotion by the chicken diet (P
⬍ 0.05, Table 2). Rats fed the beef diet did not differ from
those fed the hemoglobin diet in aberrant crypt number or
ACF per colon. However, the ACF contained more crypts in
the hemoglobin-fed group (Table 2).

MDF. Beef- and black pudding–fed rats had more MDF
than control rats (P ⬍ 0.01), and promotion by black pudding
was more potent than promotion by beef (P ⬍ 0.05, Fig. 2B).
The chicken-based diet, the low-heme diet, did not promote
MDF formation (Fig. 2B). The effects on the number of MDF
also occurred on the number of mucin-depleted crypts (Table
2). The groups did not differ in the number of crypts per MDF.
The beef and hemoglobin groups did not differ for any of the
variables tested (Table 2).

Fecal heme, TBARS, and cytotoxicity. The fecal concen-
tration of heme matched the heme intake. As expected, no
heme was detected in feces of control and chicken diet–fed
rats (Table 3). The analysis of fecal samples stored during the
study of Parnaud et al. (13) where diet containing 60% beef
meat but 130 ␮mol/g calcium yielded similar results: No heme
was detected in feces of control and chicken diet–fed rats, but
there was 1.7 ⫾ 1.5 ␮mol/g in feces of beef-fed rats. However,
in the present study, the heme concentration was higher in the
feces of hemoglobin-fed rats than in beef-fed rats (Table 3).
This is consistent with the observation that less heme iron
reaches the colon when it is supplied as red meat rather than
in hemoglobin form (14). We measured the characteristics of
fecal water because, according to studies on bile acids, the
soluble fraction of colonic contents would interact more
strongly with the mucosa than the insoluble fraction (28). As
expected, the heme concentration in fecal water depended
directly on the level of heme in the diet (Table 3), with, as
noted above, a difference between meat- and hemoglobin-fed
rats. There was no heme in fecal waters in Parnaud’s meat
study, even in samples from rats given a 60% beef diet (13).
Heme can induce the formation of peroxyl radicals in fats,
which may be cytotoxic and cleave DNA in vivo (29). Lipid

the cytolytic activity of fecal water was quantiﬁed by potassium
release from erythrocytes as described by Govers et al. (26). Second,
the cytotoxicity of fecal water obtained with a different method (see
above) was also quantiﬁed by the 3-(4,5-dimethyldiazol-2-yl)-2,5
diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) test on a cell line according to
Bonneson et al. (27). Brieﬂy, the cancerous mouse colonic epithelial
cell line, CMT93 (ECAC), was seeded in 96-well microtiter plates
(1.6 ⫻ 104 cells per well in 200 ␮L of medium) and at conﬂuence the
cells were treated for 24 h with the fecal water sample to be tested and
diluted in the culture medium at a concentration of 10% (v:v). Each
fecal water sample was tested in 7 wells and 10 wells remained
untreated to act as controls. One hundred microliters of MTT (9% in
PBS) was added to each well. After 3 h of incubation at 37°C in the
dark, 100 ␮L of a 10% SDS-0.1 mol/L NaOH mixture was added.
After 1 h of incubation in the dark, the absorbance of each well was
read using a microplate reader at wavelength 570 nm for cytotoxicity
and 690 nm for background.

Statistical analysis. Results were analyzed using Systat 10 soft-
ware for Windows and reported as means ⫾ SD. ACF scoring was
done in duplicate. ACF variables were tested ﬁrst using 2-way (groups
and readers) ANOVA. The (group ⫻ reader) interaction was never
signiﬁcant, and when total ANOVA was signiﬁcant (P ⬍ 0.05),
pairwise differences between groups were analyzed using Fishers’s
least-signiﬁcant-difference test. MDF variables and all other data
were analyzed using 1-way ANOVA and groups were compared using
Fishers’s least-signiﬁcant-difference test. The Pearson correlation co-
efﬁcient was used to determine the relations between ACF, MDF,
heme intake, and fecal values, and P values were calculated with
Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. Because the black
pudding diet contained a very high concentration of heme, heme
values were log-transformed before statistical analysis.

RESULTS

Weight gain and feed intake. Beef-fed rats quickly became
heavier than control rats, and the difference was signiﬁcant at

PIERRE ET AL.

produced equivalent effects: no lytic activity on erythrocytes,
but a 4-fold increase in CMT93 cell toxicity (P ⬍ 0.001). The
cytotoxicity of fecal water from chicken-fed rats was not dif-
ferent from that of controls (Table 3). All meat-based diets
increased the fecal pH, which was higher when the heme
concentration was higher in the diet (Table 3). Taken to-
gether, these data suggest that cytotoxicity, pH, and lipoper-
oxides of fecal water are associated with heme intake and fecal
heme. Indeed, signiﬁcant correlations were seen between
heme intake and fecal water cytotoxicity (r ⫽ 0.98), pH (r
⫽ 0.86), and TBARS (r ⫽ 0.73, all P ⬍ 0.01, n ⫽ 30 cages of
2 rats).

DISCUSSION

This study is the ﬁrst to show that meat can speciﬁcally
promote colon carcinogenesis. In addition, the promoting
effect was stronger than other promoting agents (30) and
clearly associated with the heme concentration in meat. This
study was done with a low-calcium diet containing 60% meat
and 5% easily oxidized oil. We used 2 putative precancerous
endpoints: the established ACF and the recently described
MDF. Heme in the diet led to ACF and MDF promotion in
the colon. The low-heme chicken-based diet did not promote
MDF, but increased the ACF number.

This study is, to our knowledge, the ﬁrst non-Italian study
to use a new carcinogenesis endpoint which was recently
described by Caderni et al. (20). MDF may predict tumor
outcome better than ACF, as shown in the studies of synbi-
otics, cholic acid, and piroxicam (20,21). We found that MDF
were quite easy to score, but we detected fewer MDF per
control rat than did Caderni et al. (20). This is likely the result
of the carcinogen dose: azoxymethane was injected once in-
stead of twice, and the resulting number of ACF was 75%
fewer here than in the study of Caderni et al. (72 vs. 298
ACF/colon).

That heme content in meat was responsible for promotion
of colon carcinogenesis, at least in part, is supported by the
following facts: (i) all tested meat diets promoted ACF forma-
tion, but this was signiﬁcantly greater in rats fed the high-
heme diet, based on black pudding, than for those fed the
low-heme chicken diet (Fig. 2). (ii) Only heme-containing
diets promoted MDF formation, and the effect was dose de-
pendent, because the black pudding effect was signiﬁcantly
stronger than the beef effect. MDF per colon was correlated
with heme intake (r ⫽ 0.63, n ⫽ 60, P ⬍ 0.01). (iii) Beef and
hemoglobin diets, which provided the same amount of heme,

peroxidation was thus measured in fecal water by the TBARS
assay. Lipid peroxidation was associated with heme concen-
tration in fecal water (Table 3): The black pudding diet thus
increased TBARS in the fecal water by 23-fold. The hemo-
globin diet and beef diet increased TBARS by 2- to 4-fold (all
P ⬍ 0.01), but the chicken diet did not affect fecal water
TBARS compared with the control diet.

The fecal water of hemin-fed rats is cytotoxic, which would
explain the hemin-induced increased proliferation (18). Cy-
totoxicity of fecal water was measured by 2 methods: lysis of
erythrocytes and toxicity on CMT93 cell in culture. The black
pudding diet, a very high source of heme, enhanced erythro-
cytes cytolysis by ⬎50-fold and toxicity on CMT93 cells by
8-fold (both P ⬍ 0.001, Table 3). Beef and hemoglobin diets

RED MEAT PROMOTES COLON CARCINOGENESIS IN RATS

2715

promoted ACF and MDF equally (Table 3). This meat study is
thus consistent with our previous study, where ACF were
promoted dose-dependently by graded doses of dietary hemin
(18). We think that previous studies in rats failed to show that
red meat promotes carcinogenesis because meat was included
in a high-calcium diet. The standard AIN-76 diet contains
130 mmol/kg calcium, which is similar to the concentration
that inhibits heme-induced colonic proliferation (17) and
heme-induced ACF promotion (18). Calcium precipitates
heme in the gut lumen and reduces heme concentration in
fecal water (17,18). In the study of Parnaud et al. (13), the
heme concentration was high in the feces of beef-fed rats, but
was not detectable in the fecal water (see results above). We
suggest that this is due to high dietary calcium, and it resulted
in the lack of ACF promotion by the beef diet (13). However,
the link between heme intake and ACF yield is not a direct
one: black pudding provided a huge quantity of heme to the
gut that was not mirrored linearly in the ACF outcome.

The mechanism of heme promotion is not known, but
might be linked to peroxidation, cytotoxicity, and pH. In a
previous study, we showed that pure hemin and hemoglobin
promote ACF formation and induce lipoperoxidation and
cytotoxicity of fecal water (18). Indeed, heme promotes the
nonenzymatic peroxidation of PUFA (16,18,29). The lipid
peroxyl radicals (LOO䡠) generated from simultaneous fat and
heme iron ingestion, and the resulting oxygen radicals, can
cleave DNA or modify DNA bases, which could increase
carcinogenesis (29). The beef-based diet contained 0.36
␮mol/g heme. Its intake led to 19 ␮mol/L heme in fecal water
and a 2.5-fold increase in lipoperoxidation (Table 3). Similar
TBARS values were seen in fecal water from beef-fed rats and,
in our previous study (18), from hemoglobin diet–fed rats (138
and 187 ␮mol/L MDA equivalents, respectively). In addition,
red meat intake induced fecal cytotoxicity and increased the
pH of fecal water (Table 3). Black pudding contains 25 times
more heme than beef. Compared with beef, the consumption
of black pudding led to 60 times more heme in fecal water, 7
times more TBARS, and a much higher cytotoxicity (Table
3). Fecal water from beef-fed rats or hemoglobin-fed rats (18)
did not induce cytolysis of erythrocytes, probably because
heme intake was too low. In contrast, fecal water from black
pudding–fed rats
strikingly induced erythrocyte cytolysis.
Thus, we conclude that there was a dose-dependent effect of
the heme concentration in the diet and in fecal water on the
fecal lipoperoxidation, cytotoxicity, and pH. All correlations
among these variables were signiﬁcant. In addition, MDF and
ACF numbers per rat were also correlated with these fecal
values (all r ⬎ 0.5, all P ⬍ 0.01, n ⫽ 60 rats, highest
correlation, r ⫽ 0.65 between number of MDF and cytotox-
icity). These correlations suggest that fecal cytotoxicity, li-
poperoxides, and pH may explain heme promotion of colon
carcinogenesis. That hemoglobin and meat diets, with same
heme content as hemoglobin and myoglobin, produced the
same effects also supports this idea (Table 3). Surprisingly, a
published study with a protocol very similar to this one noted
no ACF promotion (14). Fecal heme concentrations were
similar in both studies, but the fecal TBARS value was 2 times
higher in the study of Belobrajdic et al. (14). We speculate
that lipoperoxidation was inhibited by tert-butylhydroquinone
in the AIN-93 diet used by Belobradjic et al. (14). This chance
observation supports the hypothesis that heme-induced li-
poperoxidation plays a role in the promotion of colon carci-
nogenesis.

The low-heme chicken-based diet surprisingly increased
the ACF number and size (Table 2). The chicken meat used in
this study may contain a promoter that is not heme and

remains to be explained. The prominent features of the
chicken diet were high arachidonic acid and niacin. The
chicken diet contained 1 g/kg of arachidonic acid [calculated
from (31)] compared to 0.25 g/kg in other diets. Arachidonic
acid has pro-tumorigenic properties, likely by increasing pros-
taglandin synthesis (32). In addition, the chicken diet con-
tained 207 mg/kg of niacin, 4 times the 51 mg/kg found in the
control diet and twice the value in beef diet (assays done by
LARA Lab). Niacin can afford protection against carcinogen-
esis when added to a niacin-deﬁcient diet (33), but high doses
are toxic. Here, the high dose provided by the chicken-based
diet would translate to 12 times the recommended daily al-
lowance in humans. High niacin stimulates histamine release
and prostaglandin synthesis, which might explain the ACF
promotion (34). The intake of white meat is not associated
with colorectal cancer risk in most epidemiological studies
(1,2). In contrast, dietary heme iron intake is associated with
an increased risk of proximal colon cancer (35). However, in
a prospective cohort study of 34,198 Californian Adventists,
the consumption of white meat, mostly chicken, was associ-
ated with a tripled risk of colorectal cancer (36).

In summary, this study shows for the ﬁrst time a promoting
effect of red meat on carcinogenesis. It corroborates epidemi-
ological observations: high red meat intake is associated with
increased colon cancer risk. In previous meat studies (3–13),
the promoting effect of meat was inhibited by dietary calcium,
as shown by the study of Parnaud et al. (13). Furthermore,
MDF promotion was related to heme intake. Promotion was
signiﬁcantly greater for the high-heme black pudding diet than
for the medium-heme beef diet. This heme effect is in line
with recent epidemiological data (35). The low-heme chicken
diet did not promote MDF, but did increase ACF formation.
For red meat diets, promotion was associated with high fecal
water lipoperoxidation, cytolytic activity, and increase of pH,
which may explain the increased carcinogenesis.
