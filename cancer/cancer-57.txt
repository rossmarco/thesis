Abstract

Background: Differentiated thyroid cancer (TC) is the most common endocrine cancer. Fish can be an important source of

iodine and other micronutrients and contaminants that may affect the thyroid gland and TC risk.

Objective: We prospectively evaluated the relations between the consumption of total ﬁsh and different ﬁsh types and

shellﬁsh and TC risk in the EPIC (European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition) study.

Methods: EPIC is a cohort of >500,000 men and women, mostly aged 35–70 y, who were recruited in 10 European

countries. After a mean follow-up of 14 y, 748 primary differentiated TC cases were diagnosed; 666 were in women and

601 were papillary TC. Data on intakes of lean ﬁsh, fatty ﬁsh, ﬁsh products, and shellﬁsh were collected by using country-

speciﬁc validated dietary questionnaires at recruitment. Multivariable Cox regression was used to calculate HRs and 95%

CIs adjusted for many potential confounders, including dietary and nondietary factors.

Results: No signiﬁcant association was observed between total ﬁsh consumption and differentiated TC risk for the highest
compared with the lowest quartile (HR: 1.03; 95% CI: 0.81, 1.32; P-trend = 0.67). Likewise, no signiﬁcant association was

observed with the intake of any speciﬁc type of ﬁsh, ﬁsh product, or shellﬁsh. No signiﬁcant heterogeneity was found by

TC subtype (papillary or follicular tumors), by sex, or between countries with low and high TC incidence.

Conclusion: This large study shows that the intake of ﬁsh and shellﬁsh was not associated with differentiated TC risk in
Europe, a region in which iodine deﬁciency or excess is rare. J Nutr 2017;147:1366–73.

Introduction

Approximately 230,000 new cases of thyroid cancer (TC) were
estimated in 2012 among women and 70,000 among men
worldwide, with a large variability in incidence rates in different
parts of the world (1). The traditional classiﬁcation of TC is
based on morphologic and clinical
features: differentiated
[including papillary (;80% of all TC cases) and follicular
(10–20%)
tumors], medullary (5–10%), anaplastic tumors
(<5%), and other rare tumors (e.g., thyroid lymphoma and
sarcoma) (2).

To date, the only 3 well-established risk factors for TC are
exposure to ionizing radiation (3), previous benign thyroid
hyperplasia (including goiter and thyroid nodules) (4), and high
body mass (5, 6). Among dietary exposures (7–9), potential
associations with TC have been suggested with intakes of iodine-
rich seafood (10, 11), goitrogenic vegetables (12, 13), PUFAs
(14), and alcohol (15).

Fish and ﬁsh products are considered healthy foods in several
traditional

dietary patterns [e.g., Mediterranean diet

(16),

Japanese diet (17), and Healthy Nordic Food Index (18)],
because they are rich in essential nutrients, such as protein of
high biological value and minerals (e.g., iodine, calcium, iron,
and zinc) (19, 20). Fatty ﬁsh are also a good source of n–3 PUFAs
(EPA and DHA) and lipid-soluble vitamins (retinol, vitamin D,
and vitamin E). However, ﬁsh can also contain some contam-
inants such as toxic heavy metals and polychlorinated biphenyls
(PCBs) (21–23).

A current review found no association between ﬁsh con-
sumption and TC risk in data from a pooled analysis of 15 case-
control studies (5) and 1 US-based cohort (24). However, further
prospective studies, in larger number of cases, are needed to
investigate the associations between the intakes of ﬁsh and ﬁsh
subtypes and TC etiology, especially by subtypes of TC. The aim
of the current study was to prospectively evaluate the relations
between the consumption of total ﬁsh, and ﬁsh subtypes and the
risk of developing differentiated TC in the EPIC (European
Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition) study.
EPIC is one of the largest cohorts worldwide, with a large
number of differentiated TC cases and substantial heterogeneity
in ﬁsh consumption among participants from 10 European
countries (19) and therefore constitutes an ideal setting to
investigate this association.

Methods

Study population. EPIC is a multicenter cohort that was designed to
principally investigate the role of dietary, environmental, and genetic
factors in the risk of developing cancer. This cohort has 23 centers
located in 10 European countries: Denmark, France, Germany, Greece,
Italy, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Netherlands, and the United Kingdom.
Brieﬂy, the EPIC cohort includes 521,324 participants (70.1% women),
mostly aged between 35 and 70 y, recruited between 1992 and 2000,
primarily from the general population, with the exception of France
(women who were health insurance members), Utrecht and Florence
(women attending breast cancer screening), Oxford (mostly health-
conscious volunteers including a large proportion of vegetarians), and
some centers in Spain and Italy (where the participants were mostly
blood donors) (25). All of the participants gave written informed
consent, and the project was approved by ethics review boards of the
International Agency for Research on Cancer and the local participating
centers.

Dietary and lifestyle data. At baseline, dietary data were collected with
different dietary assessment instruments (e.g., quantitative or semiquan-
titative FFQs, diet histories, or a dietary questionnaire combined with a
7-d food record) that were developed and locally validated in EPIC
previously (25, 26). Face-to-face interviews were conducted in Greece,
Ragusa and Naples (Italy), and Spain, whereas questionnaires were

self-administered in all other centers. Total energy and nutrient intakes
were estimated by using the dietary questionnaires and the standard-
ized EPIC Nutrient Database (27).

For the current analysis, we used the following categories of ﬁsh and
shellﬁsh intake: lean ﬁsh and lean ﬁsh product intake [e.g., cod, haddock,
and plaice (fat content #4 g/100 g)], fatty ﬁsh and fatty ﬁsh product
intake [e.g., salmon, tuna, and trout (fat content between 4 and
14 g/100 g)], ﬁsh and ﬁsh product intake (sum of lean and fatty ﬁsh and
ﬁsh products), shellﬁsh intake (including seafood such as prawn, crab,
and mussels), and total ﬁsh and shellﬁsh intake, which was deﬁned as the
sum of intakes of ﬁsh, ﬁsh products, and shellﬁsh (19).

Information on sociodemographic and lifestyle characteristics, such
as educational
level, tobacco and alcohol consumption, physical
activity, and medical history, was self-reported at recruitment through
standardized questionnaires (25). At baseline, anthropometric data
were measured by trained staff in all centers, except in Oxford (United
Kingdom), Norway, and France, where self-reported data were
obtained.

Follow-up and case ascertainment.
Incident cancer cases were
identiﬁed through population-based cancer registries or active follow-
up (directly from study participants or next of kin) and conﬁrmed by a
combination of methods including health insurance records and cancer
and pathology registries, depending on the center. Complete follow-up
censoring dates varied among centers, ranging between December 2010
and December 2014. Cases were deﬁned as participants with a ﬁrst
primary TC (code C73 according to the International Classiﬁcation of
Diseases, 10th Revision) during follow-up.

Of the 857 TC cases, anaplastic (n = 9), medullary (n = 37), and TC
deﬁned as lymphoma (n = 1) or ‘‘other morphologies’’ (n = 5) were
excluded. We also excluded 29,332 participants (including 45 differen-
tiated TC cases) with missing or null follow-up time or prevalent cancer
other than nonmelanomatous skin cancer, 1277 participants with
incomplete information on lifestyle, and 14,555 participants (including
12 differentiated TC cases) for whom dietary information was unavail-
able or considered to be implausible (i.e., participants who were in the
top or the bottom 1% of the distribution of the ratio of total energy
intake to energy requirement). A total of 476,108 men and women and
6,639,459 person-years of observation (mean follow-up time of 14.0 y)
were included in this analysis. In this study, we had a total of 748
primary differentiated TC cases, including 601 papillary, 109 follicular,
and 38 not-otherwise-speciﬁed TC, most likely to also be papillary TC.

Statistical analyses. Cox proportional hazard models were used to
estimate HRs and 95% CIs for the association between ﬁsh intake and
TC risk. Age was used as the underlying primary dependent time
variable, with entry time deﬁned as the participantÕs age at recruitment
and exit time as age at TC diagnosis, death, or censoring date (lost to or
end of follow-up), whichever occurred ﬁrst. Tests and graphs based on
Schoenfeld residuals were used to assess proportional hazards assump-
tions, which were satisﬁed. Model 1 was stratiﬁed by center, age at
baseline (1-y interval), and sex. Model 2 was additionally adjusted for
the following potential confounders: BMI, smoking status, educational
level, physical activity, and total energy and alcohol intakes. In women,
model 2 was also adjusted for menopausal status and type, oral
contraceptive use, and infertility problems, because these were TC risk
factors in this study (28). Because ﬁsh is a source of iodine and
contaminants, absolute ﬁsh intakes could be as important as intakes
adjusted for total energy. We conducted model 2 with and without
adjustment for total energy and the results were identical; therefore, we
only present the results including total energy in model 2.

The intake of ﬁsh, overall and by ﬁsh type, was assessed by cohort-
wide quartiles or BMI-, age-, or sex-speciﬁc quartile in stratiﬁed
analyses. For shellﬁsh consumption, because of the high number of
nonconsumers (33.6%), instead of quartiles, 3 groups were created:
nonconsumers and those below and above the median of consumers.
Tests for linear trend were performed by assigning the median of each
quartile as scores. Fish and shellﬁsh consumption was also evaluated as a
continuous variable per 10 and 1 g/d, respectively. Possible interactions

intake (0, >0–15, >15–29.9, or $30 g/d), physical activity (inactive,
active, or unknown, according to the Cambridge Physical Activity Index)
(29), and BMI (in kg/m2; <25 or $25) were examined by including the
interaction terms in the most-adjusted models. Separate sex-speciﬁc
models were ﬁtted, because borderline signiﬁcant heterogeneity between
sex and total ﬁsh and shellﬁsh consumption and differentiated TC risk
was detected. Similar models were deﬁned to assess the risk of TC by
subtype (papillary and follicular). Separate models were also computed
to check the variability between countries with a high compared with
low TC incidence. EPIC countries with TC incidence rates of >5/10,000
in women (i.e., France, Germany, Greece, Italy, and Spain) were consid-
ered to have high TC incidence. The Wald test was used to evaluate the
heterogeneity of risk between sexes and TC subtypes. Two types of
sensitivity analyses were performed by excluding the following partic-
ipants from the analyses: 1) 67,391 women from the French component
of EPIC (248 cases of differentiated TC), because French women
represented 37.2% of TC cases in women, and 2) 77 cases who were
diagnosed with TC within the ﬁrst 2 y of follow-up, because some
participants may have modiﬁed their diet during the early prediagnostic
period of the disease.

Calibration of dietary data. A single 24-h dietary recall was also taken
from an 8% random sample of the cohort (36,994 participants) by
using a detailed computerized 24-h recall method (30) to calibrate
dietary measurements of ﬁsh, ﬁsh products, and shellﬁsh intake across
countries and to correct for systematic overestimation or underesti-
mation of dietary intakes (31). The 24-h recall estimates for ﬁsh, ﬁsh
products, and shellﬁsh of the participants with these data were
regressed on the values for these foods estimated from the main dietary
questionnaire values. Age at recruitment, center, and total energy
intake were included as covariates; and data were weighted by day of
the week and season of the year during which the 24-h recall was
collected. Zero consumption values in the main dietary questionnaires
were excluded in the regression calibration models, and a 0 was directly
imputed as a corrected value. Country- and sex-speciﬁc calibration
models were used to obtain individual predicted values of dietary ex-
posure for all participants. Cox regression models were then conducted
by using the predicted (calibrated) values for each individual on a
continuous scale. The SE of the calibrated coefﬁcient was estimated
with bootstrap sampling in the calibration and disease models and
repeated 300 times (31). P values <0.05 were considered signiﬁcant.
Statistical analyses were conducted by using SAS, version 9.3, software
(SAS Institute).

Results

In our study, women represented 70.1% of the total population
and the vast majority of differentiated TC cases (89.0%).
Differentiated TC was ;3 times more common in women than
in men. The most common subtype of differentiated TC was
papillary (80.3%), followed by follicular (14.6%) and not
otherwise speciﬁed (5.1%) for both sexes (Table 1). The median
intake of total ﬁsh and shellﬁsh in men (27.7 g/d) and women
(28.0 g/d) was similar. The highest consumption of total ﬁsh and
shellﬁsh in men and women was in Spain and Norway,
respectively.

Overall, men and women in the highest quartile of total ﬁsh
and shellﬁsh intake were older and more physically active, had a
higher BMI and waist circumference, reported a higher total
energy intake, were more likely to be a current smoker and to
have a secondary education, and had a higher prevalence of
diabetes than those in the lowest quartile (Supplemental Table
1). Women in the highest ﬁsh-intake quartile reported more
infertility problems than did those in the bottom quartile
(Supplemental Table 1).

No signiﬁcant association was observed between total ﬁsh

compared with the lowest quartile in either model 1 (HR: 1.03;
95% CI: 0.81, 1.32; P-trend = 0.67) or the multivariable model 2
(HR: 1.05; 95% CI: 0.81, 1.34; P-trend = 0.62) analysis (Table
2). No signiﬁcant association was found with total intakes of ﬁsh
and ﬁsh products or with lean ﬁsh, fatty ﬁsh, or shellﬁsh
separately. Separate analyses of papillary or follicular TC also
showed no signiﬁcant associations with the intake of any type of
ﬁsh or shellﬁsh, and no evidence of heterogeneity in ﬁndings by
TC histologic subtypes.

A borderline signiﬁcant interaction in the association be-
tween the intake of total ﬁsh and differentiated TC risk with sex
was found (P-interaction = 0.07), and therefore results divided
by sex are presented (Table 3). In women, no signiﬁcant
association with total ﬁsh or ﬁsh subtypes was observed. In
men, a borderline signiﬁcant inverse trend between total ﬁsh and
shellﬁsh intake and differentiated TC risk was detected
according to model 2 (P-trend = 0.05), although the associations
for the observed continuous variable (HR: 0.95; 95% CI: 0.87,
1.05), the calibrated continuous variable (HR: 0.95; 95% CI:
0.81, 1.11) (Table 3), or the extreme quartiles (HR: 0.43;
95% CI: 0.17, 1.05; with a low number of TC cases, e.g., 9 cases
in the fourth quartile) were null (data not shown). No signiﬁcant
interaction was observed with BMI status, smoking status,
physical activity, or educational level (P-interaction = 0.12, 0.81,
0.45, and 0.73, respectively). A similar lack of heterogeneity was
observed in the association of ﬁsh intake with TC risk between
countries with low and high TC incidence rates (Table 4). In the
sensitivity analyses that excluded either the large French EPIC
component or TC cases who had been diagnosed within the ﬁrst
2 y of follow-up, the results for any ﬁsh intake and TC risk were
almost identical to those of the entire cohort (data not shown).

Discussion

In the current study, the largest prospective investigation so far
on ﬁsh intake and differentiated TC risk to our knowledge, no
associations with total ﬁsh or shellﬁsh intake were observed. The
lack of associations is especially convincing for papillary
carcinomas and women, which represented the vast majority
of TC cases in EPIC. The intake of ﬁsh and shellﬁsh was also

unrelated to TC risk in all follicular TC and in both low- and
high-TC-incidence countries.

Our results are in concordance with the previous cohort
study (24), a systematic review (5), a meta-analysis (8), and a
pooled analysis of case-control studies from the United States,
Europe, Japan, and China (11). However, a high ﬁsh intake was
associated with a signiﬁcantly lower risk of TC (OR: 0.65;
95% CI: 0.48, 0.88) in studies conducted in areas with a history
of goiter endemicity, such as Italy and certain parts of Sweden
(11). A few additional small case-control studies suggested a
protective association between ﬁsh and shellﬁsh consumption
and TC risk (10, 13, 32).

Saltwater ﬁsh and shellﬁsh are a rich source of iodine, which
is known to play a role in the onset of goiter (33). However, the
possible association with TC risk is complex. A bimodal risk
effect of iodine on the pathogenesis of TC has been suspected
for a long time (11) and was recently shown in a study from
South Korea (34) in which both insufﬁcient and extremely high
iodine intakes were associated with an increased risk of benign
nodules and TC (97.5% papillary tumors). A Danish ecological
study evaluated the incidence before and after iodine supple-
mentation and found that the incidence of TC increased after
supplementation with iodine (35). This trend can, however, be
explained by the increased ability to detect thyroid nodules and TC
after the introduction of ultrasonography (36). The lack of inﬂuence
of iodine from ﬁsh is not surprising because there are currently few
mildly iodine-deﬁcient areas in Europe and iodized salt is widely
available (37). Likewise, extremely high iodine intakes, like those
reported in Japan and other Paciﬁc countries where the intake of
seafood and seaweeds is high, are very rare in Europe (10).

Fatty ﬁsh is a rich source of PUFAs, particularly n–3 PUFAs
(EPA and DHA), that have anti-inﬂammatory properties
through their impact on prostaglandin synthesis and have been
observed to be a protective factor in some types of cancers (38),
possibly including TC (21, 39). A study of long-chain serum FAs
and the risk of TC in Norway (40) showed an inverse association
between combinations of arachidonic acid (20:4n26), EPA, and
DHA serum concentrations and the risk of developing papillary
TC. A similar inverse association between PUFA intake and TC
risk was reported in the EPIC study (14). The protection,
however, may derive from food sources other than ﬁsh
(e.g., vegetable oils and nuts).

1 Model 1 was stratiﬁed by center and age at baseline (1-y interval). Model 2 was additionally adjusted for BMI, smoking status, educational
level, physical activity, and total energy and alcohol intakes and, in women, also adjusted for menopausal status and type, oral contraceptive
use, and infertility problems. EPIC, European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition; TC, thyroid cancer.

Fish can also contain different amounts of metals, such as
copper and cobalt and toxic heavy metals such as arsenic,
molybdenum, lead, mercury, and cadmium (41, 42), and of
PCBs (39). A study on trace elements suggested that an excess in
the concentrations of heavy metals (mercury, cobalt, and iodine)
and low serum concentrations of selenium increase the fre-
quency of goiter and TC (43). In addition, a Korean study
suggested that the accumulation of cadmium in thyroid tissue
may be an important etiologic factor of TC progression and
aggravation in Korean women (44). Fish consumption, with

possible PCB contamination, did not appear to increase TC risk
in New York anglers (39). Given the absence of association, the
role of any of these contaminants is unlikely to be relevant in the
population studied.

The strengths of this study are its prospective design, the
inclusion of a large number of TC cases, and the use of country-
speciﬁc validated dietary questionnaires in a study that showed
substantial variations in ﬁsh intakes across centers (26). The
inﬂuence of prevalent TC on the null associations is unlikely,
because the exclusion of cases diagnosed within the ﬁrst 2 y of

Fish intake and differentiated thyroid carcinoma

1371

follow-up did not alter our present ﬁndings. The most important
limitations of our study include the impossibility of measuring
iodine intake through questionnaires or blood samples and of
distinguishing freshwater from saltwater ﬁsh (which represents
the most frequently consumed type of ﬁsh in Europe). Although
recall bias is unlikely to be important, an inﬂuence of dietary
measurement error in the null association with ﬁsh intake cannot
be ruled out, particularly considering the long duration between
dietary data collection and outcome. We attempted to account
for this by reanalyzing the association with calibrated ﬁsh and
shellﬁsh intakes assessed by 24-h recall with the use of an
established method (31), but the results were largely unchanged.
In conclusion, the EPIC study did not show any signiﬁcant
association between the intake of ﬁsh and shellﬁsh and differ-
entiated TC risk in Europe, where very low or very high iodine
intakes are rare. Further studies are needed to assess other
dietary factors that could lower the risk of differentiated TC,
such as fruit and vegetables, other sources of PUFAs (e.g., nuts
and vegetable oils), and bioactive compounds (e.g., antioxidant
vitamins, polyphenols).
