Context Omega-3 fatty acids are purported to reduce the risk of cancer. Studies have
reported mixed results.
Objective To synthesize published and unpublished evidence to determine estimates
of the effect of omega-3 fatty acids on cancer risk in prospective cohort studies.
Data Sources Articles published from 1966 to October 2005 identified through
MEDLINE, PREMEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and
CAB Health; unpublished literature sought through letters to experts in the neutra-
ceutical industry.
Study Selection A total of 38 articles with a description of effects of consumption
of omega-3 fatty acids on tumor incidence, prospective cohort study design, human
study population; and description of effect of omega-3 among groups with different
levels of exposure in the cohort were included. Two reviewers independently re-
viewed articles using structured abstraction forms; disagreements were resolved by
consensus.
Data Extraction Two reviewers independently abstracted detailed data about the
incidence of cancer, the type of cancer, the number and characteristics of the pa-
tients, details on the exposure to omega-3 fatty acids, and the elapsed time between
the intervention and outcome measurements. Data about the methodological quality
of the study were also abstracted.
Data Synthesis Across 20 cohorts from 7 countries for 11 different types of cancer
and using up to 6 different ways to categorize omega-3 fatty acid consumption, 65
estimates of the association between omega-3 fatty acid consumption were reported.
Among these, only 8 were statistically significant. The high degree of heterogeneity
across these studies precluded pooling of data. For breast cancer 1 significant esti-
mate was for increased risk (incidence risk ratio [IRR], 1.47; 95% confidence interval
[CI], 1.10-1.98) and 3 were for decreased risk (RR, 0.68-0.72); 7 other estimates did
not show a significant association. For colorectal cancer, there was 1 estimate of de-
creased risk (RR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.27-0.89) and 17 estimates without association. For
lung cancer one of the significant associations was for increased cancer risk (IRR, 3.0;
95% CI, 1.2-7.3), the other was for decreased risk (RR, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.13-0.76),
and 4 other estimates were not significant. For prostate cancer, there was 1 estimate
of decreased risk (RR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.22-0.83) and 1 of increased risk (RR, 1.98;
95% CI, 1.34-2.93) for advanced prostate cancer; 15 other estimates did not show a
significant association. The study that assessed skin cancer found an increased risk (RR,
1.13; 95% CI, 1.01-1.27). No significant associations between omega-3 fatty acid con-
sumption and cancer incidence were found for aerodigestive cancer, bladder cancer,
lymphoma, ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer, or stomach cancer.
Conclusions A large body of literature spanning numerous cohorts from many coun-
tries and with different demographic characteristics does not provide evidence to sug-
gest a significant association between omega-3 fatty acids and cancer incidence. Di-
etary supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids is unlikely to prevent cancer.

Sally C. Morton, PhDSTUDIES SHOW THAT TISSUE LEV-

els of arachadonic acid– and
eicosopentaenoic acid (EPA)–
derived eicosanoids influence
many physiological processes, includ-
ing calcium transport across cell mem-
branes, angiogenesis, apoptosis, cell
proliferation, and immune cell func-
tion.1-4 These processes are integral to
the immune system and hence the
pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases
such as arthritis, systemic lupus ery-
thematosus, and asthma, as well as can-
cer. Epidemiological studies have sug-
gested that groups of people who
consume diets high in omega-3 fatty ac-
ids may experience a lower preva-
lence of some types of cancer,5-8 and
many small trials have attempted to as-
sess the effects of omega-3 fatty acids
on cancer treatment by adding omega-3
fatty acid to the diet either as omega-3
fatty acid–rich foods or as dietary
supplements.9-22 In addition, dietary
omega-3 fatty acids have been found to
modulate mammary tumor formation
and proliferation in rodents.23

In response to this evidence, a num-
ber of omega-3 fatty acid–containing di-
etary supplements have appeared on the

lidity of claims that omega-3 fatty ac-
ids prevent cancer, we systematically
reviewed the literature for studies that
evaluated the effect of omega-3 fatty ac-
ids on the incidence of cancer.

METHODS
The study on which this report is based
is part of a larger systematic review of
the medical literature regarding the ef-
fects of omega-3 fatty acid supplemen-
tation on both cancer incidence and
cancer treatment in humans. Conse-
quently, our initial search was broad.
This report deals only with cancer in-
cidence.

Identification of the Literature
We used electronic databases to iden-
tify published human studies about
omega-3 fatty acids and cancer (com-
plete search terms can be viewed in Ap-
pendix A.4 at http://www.ahrq.gov
/downloads/pub/evidence/pdf/03cancer
/03cancer.pdf). We did not restrict by
language. The following databases were
searched: MEDLINE (1966 through the
fifth week of October 2003),
PREMEDLINE (Nov 7, 2003), EMBASE
(1980 through the 44th week of 2003),
Cochrane Central Register of Con-
trolled Trials (third quarter of 2003),
CAB Health (1973 through October
2003. All of these databases were
searched using the Ovid interface, ex-
cept for CAB Health, which was searched
through SilverPlatter. We subse-
quently updated our search in October
2005 using the same search strategy but
restricting to observational study de-
signs. The reference lists of studies that
met our inclusion criteria were also
searched for potentially relevant titles.
External peer reviewers of a draft of this
report were also asked to identify addi-
tional relevant studies that were not in-
cluded in the draft. We also sent letters
to industry experts recommended by the
US Office of Dietary Supplements to ob-
tain any unpublished data.

Evaluation of the Literature
Two of 4 reviewers (W.A.M., P.K.,
A.M.I., and Y.-W.L.) independently
evaluated the citations and abstracts.

The reviewers flagged article titles that
focused on omega-3 fatty acids and can-
cer. Articles that either reviewer flagged
were ordered, as were articles from
whose abstracts and titles relevance
could not be determined. Two of the 4
reviewers independently reviewed each
article that was obtained to determine
whether it met inclusion criteria using
a structured screening form. The re-
viewers resolved any disagreements by
consensus. Inclusion criteria included
description of effects of consumption
of omega-3 fatty acids on tumor inci-
dence, prospective cohort study de-
sign, human study population, and de-
scription of effects of exposure to
omega-3 with different levels of expo-
sure in the cohort. Although param-
eters of methodological quality were
evaluated, they were not used as inclu-
sion criteria. Language was not a bar-
rier to inclusion. We excluded case-
control studies because they are highly
susceptible to methodological biases, es-
pecially recall bias.

All stages of the review were per-
formed independently by reviewers
trained in health services research and
the principles of critical appraisal; at
least 1 reviewer was a physician. The
reviewers resolved differences through
consensus, and a senior physician re-
searcher (C.H.M.) resolved any dis-
agreements.

Data Extraction
For the articles that passed our screen-
ing criteria, 2 reviewers indepen-
dently abstracted detailed data about the
incidence of cancer, the type of can-
cer, the number and characteristics of
the patients, details on the exposure to
omega-3 fatty acids, and the elapsed
time between the intervention and out-
come measurements. To evaluate the
quality of the design and execution of
observational studies, we collected in-
formation about the validity of ascer-
tainment of cases and exposure, de-
scription of withdrawals and dropouts,
adjustment for confounders, and
blinded assessment of exposure and
case status when ascertaining case and
exposure status, respectively.24,25 A score

for quality was not calculated for ob-
servational studies, for there is no vali-
dated method to do so.26

Data Synthesis
For this report, we constructed a
detailed summary table, stratified by
cancer type, which describes the mul-
tivariate-adjusted risk ratios (RRs) that
were reported for the study group with
the highest intake of omega-3 fatty acid
relative to the study group with the low-
est intake. This table details the spe-
cific categories of omega-3 consump-
tion for which the RRs were reported,
ie, total omega-3, marine omega-3, lino-
lenic acid (ALA), EPA, or docosahexa-
neoic acid (DHA) and fish, which can
reasonably be used as a surrogate for
omega-3 consumption given the high
omega-3 content of fish. We describe
the median intake of the relevant
omega-3 fatty acid for the study groups,
if it was reported. The categories of
omega-3 fatty acids that we report are
those that were reported in the included
studies and were not identical across the
different studies. These studies all cal-
culated the intake of different catego-
ries of omega-3 fatty acids by compar-
ing the food frequency diaries of study
participants to validated standard tables
of nutritional components including
omega-3 fatty acids. Total omega-3
intake includes all types of omega-3 fatty
acids (ALA, EPA, and DHA) that can
be obtained from food. Fish intake
describes the amount of fish con-
sumed whereas marine omega-3 fatty
acids describe the amount of ALA, EPA,
and DHA derived from marine sources.
Given the marked heterogeneity of
the identified studies in terms of
omega-3 fatty acid components re-
ported, amount of omega-3 fatty acid
consumed and exposure time to
omega-3 fatty acids, it was not reason-
able to pool data across studies. To
evaluate the possible effect of sample
size on the reported estimates of risk,
we produced plots of the RRs on which
the point estimate for each risk esti-
mate was sized according to the in-
verse of the variance for each risk
estimate.

RESULTS
Literature Search
Results from our literature search are de-
tailed in FIGURE 1. Our search identified
5040 citations from the electronic da-
tabases;93additionalcitationswereiden-
tifiedthroughreferencemining;arequest
for unpublished data yielded one cita-
tion; peer reviewers of a draft of this re-
port identified 11 citations. In total we
reviewed 5145 citations. Our reviewers
considered 1264 of these article titles to
be potentially relevant to our research
topic. We were able to retrieve 1228
(97%) of these articles. Of the articles
retrieved, 264 were accepted for further
review because they reported on results
from observational studies of omega-3
fatty acid in the treatment of cancer. Of
the 264 articles that went to further re-
view, a total of 226 were rejected because
their study designs were either case-
controlorcaseseries,whichdidnotmeet
our inclusion criteria.

The remaining 385-8,27-60 reports de-
scribed the effect of omega-3 fatty acid
on the incidence of 11 different types of
cancer among participants enrolled in 20
different prospective cohorts. The char-
acteristics of the 20 cohorts in which can-
cer incidence was studied are summa-
rized in TABLE 1. These cohorts ranged
in size from 6000 to 121 000, with from
9000 to 1.5 million person-years of ob-
servation. Together, these cohorts in-
clude more than 700 000 participants
and 3 million person-years of observa-
tion. The observation periods in these co-
horts ranged from 3 to 30 years. Omega-3
consumption was estimated based on di-
etary questionnaires that were typically
completed once at study entry al-
though a few of the cohorts updated di-
etary intake. Omega-3 consumption was
expressed as total omega-3 fatty acid, fish
or marine omega-3 fatty acid, or as the
specific omega-3 fatty acid ALA, EPA,
DHA, or all 3. Fish consumption, which
serves as a proxy for EPA and DHA con-
sumption, was also reported in many of
the studies. Across these cohorts, can-
cer incidence was assessed during the 1
to 24 years after dietary information was
obtained and was typically ascertained
using population cancer registries.

The methodological quality of the
studies was variable. All of the cohorts
reported valid methods to ascertain
exposure to omega-3 fatty acids and
cancer incidence. Likewise, all of the
cohorts reported adjustment for con-
founders, although the variables used
in multivariable analyses varied among
the studies. All but 2 of the cohorts pro-
vided descriptions of withdrawals
and dropouts.35,41 Blinded assessment
of exposure and case status when as-
certaining case and exposure status,
respectively, was reported for only 3 co-
horts: the Health Professionals Fol-
low-up Study,36,54,57-59 the Netherlands
Health Study,7,8 and the Nurses’ Health
Study.30,31,38,48,49,52

More than half of these reports
described the effect of omega-3 fatty acid
on 1 of 3 types of cancer: breast,7,29-35
colorectal,5,36-43 and prostate.8,53-58 The
remaining publications described the
effects of omega-3 fatty acid on the inci-
dence of 8 different types of cancer with
only 1 or 2 publications describing the
effects on each of the following types of
cancer: aerodigestive, bladder, lung, lym-
phoma (non-Hodgkin), ovarian, pan-
creatic, skin (basal cell carcinoma), and
stomach. The reported effects of omega-3
fatty acids on the incidence for each type
of cancer are described below. The RRs
for developing each of these types of can-
cer for the highest consumption group
(quartile, quintile, dose group, etc) rela-
tive to the lowest consumption group for
fish, total omega-3 fatty acid, marine
omega-3 fatty acid, ALA, DHA, and EPA
are detailed in FIGURE 2 and FIGURE 3
and in TABLE 2 and TABLE 3. A com-
prehensive evidence table that includes
information about the study groups with
intermediate levels of omega-3 fatty
acid consumption can be viewed in

Aerodigestive Cancer
We identified one study27 that evalu-
ated the effect of fish consumption on
the incidence of upper aerodigestive
tract cancer, which was defined as squa-
mous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity

Bladder Cancer
We identified one study28 that evalu-
ated the effect of fish consumption on the
incidence of urinary bladder cancer
among institutionalized US men of Japa-
nese ancestry who resided on the Ha-
waiian island of Oahu. In this study, fish
consumption had no significant effect on
the incidence of bladder cancer. Using
fish consumption 1 time per week or less
as the referent group, the RR of devel-
oping bladder cancer was 0.67 (95% CI,
0.26-1.67) for men consuming fish 5
times per week or more.

Breast Cancer
We identified 8 studies7,29-35 from 6 dif-
ferent cohorts that evaluated the effect
of omega-3 fatty acid on the incidence
of breast cancer. Breast cancer inci-
dence relative to fish consumption was
reported in 4 studies,29,30,33,34 inci-
dence relative to total32,35 and marine
omega-3 fatty acid35 consumption was
reported in 2, and incidence relative to
each of the specific omega-3 fatty acid,
DHA, EPA, and ALA was reported in 1
study.7 Among the 4 studies that as-
sessed the relationship between fish in-
take and breast cancer, 1 demon-
strated an increased risk for women in
the highest quartile of fish intake rela-
tive to women in the lowest quartile (in-
cidence RR [IRR], 1.47; 95% CI, 1.10-
1.98),29 1 demonstrated a reduced risk
among women with “unknown” dried
fish intake relative to women who con-
sumed 1 or fewer servings per week
(RR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.60-0.98) but no
association with “not dry” fish33 and 2
found no association between fish con-
sumption and the risk of breast can-
cer. Neither of the 2 studies that as-
sessed the effect of total omega-3 fatty
acid consumption on breast cancer risk
reported an association with breast can-
cer. However, 1 of these studies35 found
a reduced risk for women in the high-
est quartile of marine omega-3 fatty acid
consumption relative to those in the
lowest quartile of consumption (RR,
0.72; 95% CI, 0.53-0.98). The one
study7 that assessed the effects of ALA,
EPA, and DHA consumption on breast
cancer risk reported a reduced risk for

tiles of ALA consumption (RR, 0.70;
95% CI, 0.51-0.97); associations be-
tween ALA consumption and breast
cancer incidence were not significant
for comparisons between the other
quintiles and the lowest quintiles. There
was no association between incidence
of breast cancer and consumption of
either EPA or DHA.

Among these cohorts, 2 assessed the
effect of menopausal status on the as-
sociation between omega-3 fatty acids
and cancer incidence. In stratified
analyses, the Nurses’ Health Study,
which found no association between
either fish consumption or total
omega-3 consumption among all
women, also found no association be-
tween fish intake and the incidence of
breast cancer among premenopausal or
postmenopausal women.30 In this same
cohort, marine omega-3 fatty acid con-
sumption was associated with a small
increased risk of breast cancer among
postmenopausal women (RR, 1.09; 95%
CI, 1.02-1.17), but not for premeno-
pausal women.31 The Singapore Chi-
nese Health Study reported that the re-
duced incidence of breast cancer
associated with marine omega-3 fatty
acid consumption was confined to post-
menopausal women and to women with
advanced stage disease (stage II or
greater).35

The relationship between fish in-
take, estrogen receptor positivity, and
cancer incidence was assessed in 1
study.29 In this study, the incidence RR
for breast cancer per mean intake of 25
g/d of fish was 1.14 (95% CI, 1.03-
1.26) for estrogen receptor–positive
women and 1.00 (95% CI, 0.81-1.24)
for estrogen receptor–negative women.
The relationship between breast can-
cer incidence, marine omega-3 fatty acid
intake, and omega-6 fatty acid intake
was examined in 1 study.35 In this study,
among participants in the lowest quar-
tile of marine omega-3 fatty acid con-
sumption, breast cancer risk in-
creased significantly with increasing
levels of omega-6 fatty acid consump-
tion (P for trend = .08). Relative to
women in the lowest quartile of both

cancer for women in both the lowest
quartile of omega-3 consumption and
the highest quartile of omega-6 con-
sumption was 1.87 (95% CI, 1.06-3.27).

Among the 2 studies that measured total
omega-3 fatty acid consumption, 1 dem-
onstrated a trend for reducing the risk
of colorectal cancer with higher con-
sumption of omega-3 fatty acid when
adjusting only for age40; the other did
not find an association.41 However, with
adjustment for multiple variables no sig-
nificant association was observed
between omega-3 fatty acid consump-
tion and the incidence of colorectal can-
cer. Likewise, the study that measured
marine omega-3 fatty acid consump-
tion demonstrated a trend for reduc-
ing the risk of cancer of the large bowel
with higher consumption of marine
omega-3 fatty acid when adjusting only
for age but not with adjustment for mul-
tiple variables. This same study found
no association between marine omega-3
fatty acids and adenomas or with can-
cers of the small bowel, distal colon, or
rectum. No significant association
with the incidence of colorectal cancer
was found with ALA, DHA, or EPA
consumption.42

Five of the studies5,38-41 involved 3 dif-
ferent cohorts of women, 1 involved a
cohort of men,36 and 2 included co-
horts of men and women.37,42 Among
the latter, 1 study performed sub-
group analyses among men and women
and found no association between fish
consumption and colon cancer for men
or women.37 The study that demon-
strated a favorable association be-
tween a source of omega-3 fatty acid
and incidence of colorectal cancer af-
ter adjustment for multiple variables
was performed in a cohort of women.5
Three of the studies assessed the in-
cidence of colon cancer only37,38,40 and
6 assessed the incidence of colorectal
cancer including cancers of the colon
or rectum.5,36,39,41-43 In 2 studies from the
same cohort that assessed the inci-
dence of colon cancer, rectal cancer, and
colorectal cancer,39,42 no difference was
found in the association between fish,
ALA, EPA, or DHA intake and the in-
cidence of any of these types of can-
cer, ie, there was no association in any
case. The study that demonstrated a fa-
vorable association between a source of
omega-3 fatty acid and incidence of co-

lorectal cancer after adjustment for mul-
tiple variables included both cancers of
the colon and rectum to define colo-
rectal cancer.5

Lung Cancer
We identified 3 studies6,45,46 from 3 dif-
ferent cohorts that evaluated the effect
of omega-3 fatty acid on the incidence
of lung cancer and 1 that evaluated the
effect of omega-3 fatty acid intake on
death from lung cancer.44 All of these
studies assessed lung cancer inci-
dence relative to fish consumption. In
1 study,6 fish consumption was asso-
ciated with a reduced risk of lung can-
cer (RR, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.13-0.76). In
another study, fish consumption was as-
sociated with an increased risk of lung
cancer46 (IRR, 3.0; 95% CI, 1.2-7.3). In
the other studies, no significant asso-
ciation was found between fish intake
and lung cancer incidence45,46 or death
from lung cancer.44

Each of the cohorts was population
based and included men and women.
The base population comprised resi-
dents of a single rural prefecture in Ja-
pan in 1 study,6 19 Japanese prefec-
tures in another study,44 and people
residing in Norway in the other 2.45,46
One study reported the risk of dying
from lung cancer stratified by sex.44 This
study found no significant association
between fish consumption and death
from lung cancer for either men or
women.

Lymphoma
We identified 2 studies from 2 differ-
ent cohorts that evaluated the effect of
omega-3 fatty acid on the incidence of
non-Hodgkin lymphoma.47,48 One study
assessed incidence relative to fish con-
sumption, the other relative to marine
omega-3 fat consumption. Neither
study found a significant association be-
tween fish intake and the incidence of
non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

Both cohorts were restricted to
women. The Nurses’ Health Study co-
hort includes US women who are reg-
istered nurses who responded to a
mailed questionnaire.48 The Iowa Wom-
en’s Health Study cohort includes

women who had valid Iowa driver’s li-
censes at the time of recruitment.

Ovarian
We identified 2 reports49,50 that evalu-
ated the effect of omega-3 fatty acids on
the incidence of ovarian cancer. In 1
there was no association between fish
consumption and the incidence of ovar-
ian cancer.50 The other found no effect
of different kinds of fat, including the
omega-3 fatty acids DHA, EPA, and
ALA, on the incidence of ovarian can-
cer among women enrolled in the
Nurses Health Study.49 In this latter
study, no evidence of an association be-
tween intake of any type of fat includ-
ing DHA, EPA, and ALA and the inci-
dence of ovarian cancer was found.
Secondary analyses showed that total
fat intake (ie, different levels of total fat
intake) had no effect on the develop-
ment of specific subtypes of ovarian
cancer (serous, mucinous, and endo-
metrial tumors). However, these analy-
ses were not conducted for omega-3
fatty acids specifically.

The participants in the first study
were women from a population-based
sampling of several counties in Swe-
den. The participants in the latter study
were all female registered nurses in the
United States.

The latter study assessed for several
different subpopulations the effect of
total fat intake, but not omega-3 fat in-
take, on the development of ovarian
cancer. The relation between fat in-
take and ovarian cancer risk (ie, no as-
sociation) did not differ substantially
by age or menopausal status. The ef-
fects of several covariates on the effect
of total fat intake but not omega-3 fat
were also assessed. Neither body mass
index, oral contraceptive use, smok-
ing status, nor physical activity level had
an effect on the relation between fat in-
take and ovarian cancer.

Pancreatic Cancer
We identified 2 studies51,52 from 2 dif-
ferent cohorts that evaluated the effect
of omega-3 fatty acid on the incidence
of pancreatic cancer. One study as-
sessed incidence relative to fish,

tion51; the other assessed incidence rela-
tive to ALA consumption.52 There was
no significant association between fish
intake and any of these measures of
omega-3 fatty acid in either study.

One cohort comprised women, the
other of men. In the Nurses Health
Study, participants responded to a
mailed questionnaire.52 The Alpha-
tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Pre-
vention Study cohort includes men who
smoke.

Prostate Cancer
We identified 7 studies8,53-58 from 5 dif-
ferent cohorts that evaluated the effect
of omega-3 fatty acid on the incidence
of prostate cancer. Prostate cancer in-
cidence relative to fish consumption was
reported in 4 studies,53-56 relative to ma-
rine omega-3 fatty acid consumption
in 1,57 relative to the specific omega-3
fatty acid DHA and EPA in 2,8,58 and rela-
tive to the specific omega-3 fatty acid
ALA in 3.8,57,58 Among the 4 studies that
assessed risk relative to fish consump-
tion, 1 demonstrated a favorable effect
(risk for never/seldom consumption rela-
tive to moderate consumption [RR, 2.3;
95% CI, 1.2, 4.5),56 1 showed a trend to-
ward a favorable effect,55 and 2 did not
find an association.53,54 For ALA, there
was no association with overall pros-
tate cancer risk in 2 studies,8,58 How-
ever, 1 of these studies demonstrated in-
creased risk for advanced prostate cancer
(RR, 1.98; 95% CI, 1.34-2.93) for high-
est vs lowest quintile of ALA consump-
tion).58 No significant association with
the incidence of prostate cancer was
found with marine omega-3 fats,57 EPA,
or DHA consumption.8,58

All analyses were restricted to men
of racial groups that were homoge-
neous within but that differed across the
studies. These studies followed up co-
horts that are ethnically, geographi-
cally, socioeconomically distinct. The
base populations for these studies com-
prised Hawaiian men of Japanese an-
cestry,53 Seventh-day Adventist men re-
siding in California,55 US male health
care professionals,54 Swedish male twin
pairs,56 and the Dutch population.8

EFFECT OF OMEGA-3 FATTY ACIDS ON CANCER RISK

Skin Cancer (Basal Cell Carcinoma)
One study59 evaluated the effect of
omega-3 fatty acid on the incidence of
skin cancer among male health care
professionals. This study assessed in-
cidence of basal cell carcinoma rela-
tive to omega-3 fatty acid consump-
tion. Relative to participants in the
lowest quartile of omega-3 fat con-
sumption, those in the highest quar-
tile of consumption had a small but sta-
tistically significant increase in the risk
of basal cell carcinoma (RR, 1.13; 95%
CI, 1.01-1.27).

Stomach Cancer
We identified 1 study60 that evaluated
the effect of omega-3 fatty acid on the
incidence of stomach cancer. This study
assessed incidence relative to fish con-
sumption and found no association with
the incidence of stomach cancer.

This study performed stratified analy-
ses for men and women and found no
association between fish consumption
and stomach cancer risk for either
group.

COMMENT
Among 65 estimates of association cal-
culated across 20 different cohorts for
11 different types of cancer and 6 dif-
ferent ways to assess omega-3 fatty acid
consumption, only 10 are statistically
significant. Significant associations be-
tween omega-3 fatty acid consump-
tion and cancer risk were reported for
breast cancer in 4 studies7,29,33,35; for co-
lorectal cancer in 15; for lung cancer in
26,46; for prostate cancer in 256,58; and for
skin cancer in 1.59 However, for each
breast, lung, and prostate cancer, there
were significant associations for both
increased risk and decreased risk and
far more estimates that did not dem-
onstrate any association. The study that
assessed skin cancer risk found a sig-
nificantly increased risk.59 Hence, no
trend was found across many different
cohorts and many different categories
of omega-3 fatty acid consumption to
suggest that omega-3 fatty acids re-
duce overall cancer risk.

Considering these data together,
there is no overall trend across differ-

ent cohorts and categories of omega-3
fatty acid consumption to suggest that
omega-3 fatty acids reduce overall can-
cer risk; that is, omega-3 fatty acids ap-
pear not to affect a mechanism of can-
cer development that is common across
the different types of cancers evalu-
ated in this report. Likewise, there is
little to suggest that omega-3 fatty ac-
ids reduce the risk of any single type
of cancer. Although risk reductions
were observed for breast, colorectal,
lung, and prostate cancer, the major-
ity of other studies for these types of
cancer, found no association. Indeed,
for each breast, lung, and prostate can-
cer, there were studies that reported an
increased risk of cancer. Hence, we did
not identify any specific types of can-
cer for which the composite evidence
suggests an association between
omega-3 fatty acids and cancer inci-
dence. However, for most types of can-
cer, the data are not sufficient to ex-
clude with confidence an association
between omega-3 fatty acid consump-
tion and cancer incidence.

In considering the data, the relative
strength of the data presented by indi-
vidual studies should be considered in
terms of methodological quality and
sample size. All studies that entered this
analysis were prospective in design and
reported methodological attributes sug-
gestive of high methodological quality
(Table 1). The sample size was large in
each of the studies, ranging from 6000
to 121 000. Although quantitative
methods to evaluate the effect of sample
size on overall risk were not used in this
analysis as a result of substantial het-
erogeneity across studies, qualitative
evaluation of the data does not sug-
gest differences in reported risks based
on sample size. Indeed, across all stud-
ies and across studies for each type of
cancer, those with the largest sample
size report no association between
omega-3 fatty acids and cancer risk. Vi-
sual inspection of Figure 2 and Figure 3
demonstrates that risk estimates for the
studies with the smallest variance, ie,
the largest studies, are generally at or
near the null value. Studies for which
the magnitude of the reported risk ra-

tio (positive or negative) was large and
generally had large variance and small
sample size.

The apparent absence of an associa-
tion between omega-3 fatty acid and the
incidence of cancer in humans ap-
pears to contrast with the findings from
studies of laboratory animals and in
vitro studies. Reviews of studies in labo-
ratory animal and in vitro models gen-
erally report small but significant sup-
pressive effects of dietary n-3 fatty acid
on the incidence, growth rate, or pro-
liferation of mammary, prostate, co-
lon, and pancreatic tumors.23 How-
ever, several factors make it unclear
how much light these results shed on
the development or progression of can-
cer in humans. First, the models used
to conduct these studies do not come
close to replicating human exposures
and have not yet succeeded in eluci-
dating the mechanisms by which
omega-3 fatty acids might be exerting
their effects, not to mention the stage
of tumor development. Second, the
methods used to modify dietary
omega-3 fatty acid composition in the
animal models are controversial.23 Be-
cause they generally consist of vary-
ing the ratio of omega-3 to omega-6
fatty acids or simply supplementing a
commercial diet with omega-3 fatty ac-
ids (usually in the form of fish oil), it
is impossible to assess whether posi-
tive findings are attributable to in-
creased exposure to omega-3 fatty ac-
ids, decreased exposure to omega-6 fatty
acids, or some other effect such as the
decreased caloric intake that might re-
sult from decreased dietary palatabil-
ity, since these studies almost always
provide food ad lib and seldom mea-
sure intake. An additional concern is
that the high doses of omega-3 fatty acid
frequently used in animal studies could
produce bleeding if administered to hu-
mans.23

Interpretation of the data we report
are limited by differences in the char-
acteristics of the populations that were
studied in the different cohorts and by
differences in the methods used to as-
certain exposure to omega-3 fatty acids
and tumor incidence. With regard to dif-

ferences in population characteristics,
differences in measured and unmea-
sured characteristics across cohorts
could affect the estimates of effect of
omega-3 fatty acids in studies relative to
one another. Of particular note is the fact
that omega-3 fatty acid consumption
varied a great deal across study co-
horts. However, given that basically no
effect was found in any of the cohorts,
this difference could be regarded as evi-
dence that omega-3 fatty acids have no
effect regardless of intake. With regard
to differences in the methods used to as-
certain omega-3 fatty acid exposure, with
the exception of the Health Profession-
als Follow-up Study and the Nurses’
Health Study, all other studies assessed
omega-3 exposure at a single time point.
For these studies it is not known
whether omega-3 fatty acid consump-
tion remained constant over the obser-
vation period for ascertainment of can-
cer incidence, which ranged from 1 to
27 years. Thus, the reported estimates
of effect for these studies should be in-
terpreted with caution.

With regard to publication bias, for
observational studies, publication bias
occurs as the result of preferential pub-
lication of studies with outcomes that
achieve statistical significance, with no
regard for whether such outcomes were
secondary in nature. Given that the re-
sults for the observational studies in-
cluded in this article were all essen-
tially negative, publication bias does not
appear to be present.

Regarding incomplete data, it is pos-
sible that additional information that
would change our conclusions is avail-
able in reports that we were unable to
locate or for which we were unable to
find a translator. However, it is un-
likely that our data were incomplete,
given that our screening strategy was
broad and that among the more than
1200 articles that were of possible rel-
evance to the report only 36 could not
be located.

A large body of literature spanning
numerous cohorts from many coun-
tries and with different demographic
characteristics did not provide evi-
dence to suggest a significant associa-

tion between omega-3 fatty acids and
cancer incidence. Dietary supplemen-
tation with omega-3 fatty acids is un-
likely to reduce the risk of cancer.

CORRECTIONS

Data Error: In the Original Contribution entitled “Development and Validation of
a Prognostic Index for 4-Year Mortality in Older Adults” published in the Febru-
ary 15, 2006, issue of JAMA (2006;295:801-808), a data error was published. In
the Box, the number of points assigned for diabetes should have been 1.

Incorrect Study Listed: In the Review Article entitled “Effects of Omega-3 Fatty
Acids on Cancer Risk: A Systematic Review” published in the January 25, 2006,
issue of JAMA (2006;295:403-415), a study was incorrectly identified. In Figure
2, in the “Prostate” cancer section, the “Swedish Women,42 2001” entry should
read “Swedish Twin Registry,56 2001.”

Incorrect Data: In the Original Contribution entitled “Operating Characteristics of
Prostate-Specific Antigen in Men With an Initial PSA Level of 3.0 ng/mL or
Lower” published in the July 6, 2005, issue of JAMA (2005;294:66-70), the data
in the “Race” section of TABLE 1 were incorrect. These data should have read as
follows:
