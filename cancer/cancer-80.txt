Meat consumption and risk of colorectal cancer: A meta-analysis
of prospective studies

Accumulating epidemiologic evidence indicates that high con-
sumption of red meat and of processed meat may increase the risk
of colorectal cancer. We quantitatively assessed the association
between red meat and processed meat consumption and the risk
of colorectal cancer in a meta-analysis of prospective studies pub-
lished through March 2006. Random-effects models were used to
pool study results and to assess dose-response relationships. We
identiﬁed 15 prospective studies on red meat (involving 7,367
cases) and 14 prospective studies on processed meat consumption
(7,903 cases). The summary relative risks (RRs) of colorectal can-
cer for the highest vs. the lowest intake categories were 1.28 (95%
conﬁdence interval (CI) 5 1.15–1.42) for red meat and 1.20 (95%
CI 5 1.11–1.31) for processed meat. The estimated summary RRs
were 1.28 (95% CI 5 1.18–1.39) for an increase of 120 g/day of red
meat and 1.09 (95% CI 5 1.05–1.13) for an increase of 30 g/day of
processed meat. Consumption of red meat and processed meat
was positively associated with risk of both colon and rectal cancer,
although the association with red meat appeared to be stronger
for rectal cancer. In 3 studies that reported results for subsites in
the colon, high consumption of processed meat was associated with
an increased risk of distal colon cancer but not of proximal colon
cancer. The results of this meta-analysis of prospective studies
support the hypothesis that high consumption of red meat and of
processed meat is associated with an increased risk of colorectal
cancer.

High consumption of red meat and processed meat has been
associated with increased risk of colorectal cancer in many epide-
miologic studies, although the associations were usually not statis-
tically signiﬁcant. A meta-analysis of prospective studies pub-
lished through June 1999 reported that a daily increase of 100 g of
red meat or 25 g of processed meat was associated with a 17% and
49%, respectively, increased risk of colorectal cancer.1 Similar
associations between red meat and processed meat consumption
with colorectal cancer risk were found in another meta-analysis,2
which included both case–control and prospective studies publish-
ed through 1999. These 2 meta-analyses did not report prospective
results for colon and rectal cancer separately, and there is evidence
that colon and rectal cancers as well as those in the proximal and
distal colon may have distinct etiologies.3–5

Ten prospective studies4–13 have since 1999 been published on
red meat and/or processed meat consumption in relation to risk of
colorectal cancer. The current meta-analysis updates and expands
the previous meta-analyses1,2 to include all prospective studies on
this issue published through March 2006. This meta-analysis
includes up to 6 times as many cases of colorectal cancer as the 2
earlier meta-analyses, thus providing more precise risk estimates.
Herein, we also report summary results for colon and rectal cancer
separately as well as for subsites in the colon (i.e., proximal and
distal colon).

Material and methods
Assembly of literature

To be included in this meta-analysis, studies had to (i) use a
prospective study design and (ii) provide relative risks with corre-
sponding conﬁdence intervals (or data to calculate them) of the
association of red meat or processed meat consumption with

incidence of or mortality from colon, rectal or colorectal cancer.
We omitted studies that reported results only for total meat
(including chicken or ﬁsh). Studies were identiﬁed by searching
MEDLINE for literature published in any language from 1966
through March 2006, using the search terms meat, foods, diet, colo-
rectal, colon, rectal, cancer, neoplasm, prospective, cohort and
exploded variants. References in the retrieved publications as well
as those in previous meta-analyses,1,2 were checked for any other
pertinent studies.

We identiﬁed 23 publications that reported results from prospec-
tive studies on red meat and/or processed meat consumption in
relation to risk of colon or colorectal cancer.4–26 Four publica-
tions14–17 were excluded because they were superseded by later
publication.4,6,9 There were 2 publications based on the Iowa
Women’s Health.18,25 The earlier publication by Bostick et al.18
was included in the meta-analysis because this study focused on
meat consumption and adjusted for more covariates than the latter
publication by Sellers et al.25 (the latter publication presented
results stratiﬁed by family history of colon cancer25). The remain-
ing 18 publications4–13,18–24,26 were included in the meta-analysis.

Data extraction

We extracted the following data from each publication: the ﬁrst
author’s last name, the year of publication, the country in which
the study was performed, the sample size, the age of the partici-
pants at cohort entry, the method of assessment of diet, the years
of follow-up, the categories of meat consumption, the variables
controlled for in the multivariate models, and the relative risks
and 95% CI for colorectal cancer associated with red meat and
processed meat consumption. From each study, we extracted the
relative risks that reﬂected the greatest degree of control for poten-
tial confounders.

Statistical analysis

We used the reported relative risk (RR) as the measure of asso-
ciation of red meat or processed meat consumption with colorectal
cancer risk. Reported RRs and corresponding standard errors
(SEs) were transformed to their natural logarithms to stabilize the
variances and to normalize the distributions. The SEs were derived
from the conﬁdence intervals (CIs) provided in each study. We
quantiﬁed the relations between red meat and processed meat con-
sumption with colorectal cancer risk with the method of DerSimo-
nian and Laird27 by use of the assumptions of a random-effects
model, which considers both within-study and between-study vari-
ation. For studies that provided separate RRs for colon and rectal
cancer4,6,7,9 and/or for women and men,7,26 we pooled the RRs,
weighted by the inverse of the variance, within each study.

FIGURE 1 – Relative risks of colorectal cancer comparing the highest with the lowest category of red meat consumption. Studies are ordered
by year of publication. Squares represent study-speciﬁc relative risks (RRs) and the sizes of the squares reﬂect the statistical weight that each
study contributed to the summary estimate; horizontal lines represent 95% conﬁdence intervals (CIs); diamond represents the summary estimate
and its 95% CI. *Nurses’ Health Study; **Health Professionals Follow-Up Study.

For the dose-response meta-analysis, we used the method pro-
posed by Greenland and coworkers28,29 to compute study-speciﬁc
slopes (linear trends) from the correlated natural log of the RRs
across categories of meat intake. This method requires that the dis-
tribution of cases and noncases (or person-time) and the RR with
its variance estimate for at least 3 quantitative exposure categories
are known. For studies that did not provide the number of cases
and noncases in each consumption category, we estimated the
slopes using variance-weighted least squares regression. Because
the studies included in our meta-analysis used different units to
report meat consumption (i.e., grams, servings or frequencies), we
rescaled meat consumption into grams per day. We used 120 g as
the approximate average portion size for red meat and 50 g as
the average portion size for processed meat.2 For the study by
Gaard et al.,26 120 g was used as the average portion size for
sausage. For each study, the median or mean level of consumption
for each category was assigned to each corresponding RR. When
the median or mean consumption was not reported, we assigned
the midpoint of the upper and lower bound in each category as the
average intake. If the upper bound was not provided, we assumed
that it had the same amplitude as the preceding category.

We used the Q and I2 statistics30 to examine statistical hetero-
geneity among the studies included in the meta-analysis. For the Q
statistic, heterogeneity was considered present for p  0.1. I2 is
the proportion of total variation contributed by between-study var-
iation.30 We conducted subgroup analyses to examine potential
sources of heterogeneity by cancer site, sex, study location, start
of follow-up, length of follow-up, the year of publication and con-
trol for potential confounders. Publication bias was assessed with
the use of funnel plots and with the Egger’s regression asymmetry
test31 (p  0.1 was considered representative of statistically signi-
ﬁcant publication bias). The potential inﬂuence that unpublished

studies could have on the summary results was examined using a
trim and ﬁll analysis.32 Statistical analyses were performed using
Stata (release 9.0; StataCorp, College Station, TX).

Results
Characteristics of studies

Characteristics of the 19 prospective studies (1 publication4
had 2 independent cohorts, which were included as 2 separate
studies) included in the meta-analysis are shown in Table I. Two
studies13,19 were case–control studies nested within prospective
cohorts. Nine studies were conducted in the United States, 8 in
Europe and 1 each in Australia and Japan. The study population
in 10 studies included men and women, 4 consisted entirely of
men, and 5 consisted of only women. The cohort sizes ranged
from 9,959 to 478,040, and the number of cases ranged from 73 to
1,667.

Red meat (highest vs. lowest category)

All 15 studies that examined the association between red meat
consumption and risk of colorectal cancer found a positive rela-
tionship (Fig. 1). Combined, the 15 studies included 1,042,824
participants and 7,367 cases. There was no heterogeneity among
studies (Q 5 4.86; p 5 0.99; I2 5 0%). The summary RR of color-
ectal cancer was 1.28 (95% CI 5 1.15–1.42) for subjects in the
highest category of red meat consumption compared with those in
the lowest category. Summary results did not change materially
when we excluded the 2 nested case–control studies13,19 (RR 5 1.28;
95% CI 5 1.15–1.42) or the 2 studies based on colorectal cancer
mortality7,20 (RR 5 1.27; 95% CI 5 1.14–1.42). The association

The 14 studies that investigated the association between proc-

1,153,401 participants and 7,903 cases) did not show substantial
heterogeneity (Q 5 12.41; p 5 0.50; I2 5 0%). The summary RR
of colorectal cancer was 1.20 (95% CI 5 1.11–1.31) for individu-
als in the highest relative to the lowest category of processed meat
consumption (Fig. 2). High vs. low consumption of processed
meat was associated with an increased risk of both colon and
rectal cancer (Table II). Only 3 studies5,8,9 reported results for
subsites in the colon. In these studies, high consumption of pro-
cessed meat was associated with an increased risk of distal colon

subsites 5 0.06). There were no signiﬁcant differences (p-hetero-
geneity > 0.10) in the summary RRs between subgroups deﬁned
by sex, study location, start of follow-up, length of follow-up or
year of publication (Table II). In addition, stratifying the studies
by adjustment for potential confounders, there were no signiﬁcant
differences between subgroups. Restricting the analysis to studies
that adjusted for physical activity, body mass index, smoking and
any of the considered dietary variables (alcohol, energy or calcium
intake)4,7–9,23 yielded a summary RR of 1.22 (95% CI 5 1.08–
1.38). The funnel plot suggested a possible absence of negative
studies involving small sample sizes (p 5 0.08 by Egger’s test).
According to the trim and ﬁll analysis, 2 such studies may be
missing. Adding those missing studies to the meta-analysis gave a
summary RR of 1.19 (95% CI 5 1.08–1.31).

Dose-response meta-analysis

For the dose-response meta-analysis of red meat consumption,
14 studies4,5,8–13,18–20,23,24 were included, whereas 1 study21 was
excluded because red meat consumption could not be quantiﬁed.
The estimated summary RR of colorectal cancer for an increase in
red meat consumption of 120 g/day was 1.28 (95% CI 5 1.18–
1.39), without heterogeneity among studies (Table III). The
summary RR was greater for rectal cancer than for colon cancer

(p-heterogeneity between cancer sites 5 0.07); there was hetero-
geneity among study results for rectal cancer (Table III).

Eleven studies4–8,10,11,18,23,26 were included in the dose-response
meta-analysis of processed meat consumption. Three studies9,21,22
were excluded because processed meat consumption could not be
quantiﬁed. The estimated summary RR of colorectal cancer for an
increase in processed meat consumption of 30 g/day was 1.09 (95%
CI 5 1.05–1.13), without heterogeneity among studies (Table III).
The summary RRs were similar for colon and rectal cancer, and for
studies conducted in Europe and in the United States (Table III).

Discussion

Findings of this meta-analysis involving almost 8,000 cases
from 19 prospective studies show consistent associations between
high consumption of red meat and of processed meat and an
increased risk of colorectal cancer. Individuals in the highest cate-
gory of red meat or processed meat consumption had a 28% and
20%, respectively, higher risk of colorectal cancer compared with
those in the lowest intake categories. High consumption of red
meat and processed meat was associated with an increased risk of
both colon and rectal cancer, although the association with red
meat was more pronounced for rectal cancer. The positive associa-

tion with processed meat consumption was stronger for distal
colon cancer than for proximal colon cancer. Results were consist-
ent for women and men, and for studies carried out in Europe and
in the United States.

Our meta-analysis has several strengths. First, our quantitative
assessment was based on prospective studies, which tend to be less
susceptible to bias (e.g., recall and selection bias) than retrospec-
tive case–control studies. Moreover, most of the included studies,
particularly those published since 2004, had a large sample size.
Hence, meta-analysis of these studies provides high statistical
power for estimating the relationship between meat consumption
and colorectal cancer risk. The relatively large number of included
studies also allowed us to perform subgroup analyses according to
study characteristics.

As a meta-analysis of observational studies, our ﬁndings have
several limitations. First, this type of meta-analysis leaves the pos-
sibility of confounding as a potential explanation for the observed
associations. Nevertheless, the associations between meat con-
sumption and colorectal cancer risk persisted when we restricted
the analysis to studies that adjusted for major potential con-
founders. A second limitation is that our ﬁndings were likely to be
inﬂuenced by imprecise measurement of meat consumption. Cate-
gorization of exposures that are measured with nondifferential
error may produce differential misclassiﬁcation and may bias the
relative risk toward or away from the null value.33,34 Hence, mis-
classiﬁcation of meat consumption in the original studies might
have lead to an underestimate or an overestimate of the summary
relative risks estimates. Finally, because our meta-analysis was
based on published studies, the possibility of publication bias
could be of concern. Studies with null results or small sample
sizes are less likely to be published.35 There was suggestion of
publication bias in the literature for processed meat consumption.
However, adjusting for unpublished studies had negligible effect
on the summary results.

In general, our ﬁndings for red meat consumption and risk
of colorectal cancer are in accord with those of 2 previous meta-
analyses,1,2 but are more precise because of a larger number of
cases. In the 2 earlier meta-analyses, for prospective studies
(including 2,100–2,500 cases), an increase in red meat consump-
tion of 100–120 g/day was associated with a 17–22% increased
risk of colorectal cancer.1,2 In the present meta-analysis, the mag-
nitude of the relationship of processed meat consumption with col-
orectal cancer risk was weaker than in the earlier meta-analyses,1,2

which estimated a 49–54% increase in risk of colorectal cancer
(including about 1,200 cases) for an increment in processed meat
consumption of 25–30 g/day.

Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the relation-
ship between red meat or processed meat consumption and colo-
rectal cancer risk. Red meat contains higher amounts of heme iron
than white meat. Heme damages the colonic mucosa and stimu-
lates epithelial proliferation in animal studies.36 Heme iron intake
has been positively associated with the risk of colon cancer in pro-
spective cohort studies.37,38 Ingestion of red meat and heme iron
supplementation has been shown to increase fecal concentrations
of N-nitroso compounds (NOCs),39–41 many of which are potent
animal carcinogens.42 The positive association with processed
meat consumption may be partly due to NOCs already present in
the meat. Meat cooked at high temperatures also contains other
potential mutagens and carcinogens in the form of heterocyclic
amines (HCAs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs).
The cancer risk posed to humans by HCAs and PAHs may depend
on the extent to which these compounds are activated by meta-
bolic enzymes.43 The fat content of meat may inﬂuence the risk of
colorectal cancer by increasing the production of secondary bile
acids,44 which may promote colon carcinogenesis.45 However,
epidemiologic studies have generally not shown an association
between fat intake and colon cancer risk.46

Several lines of evidence indicate that cancers occurring in the
proximal and distal colon may have distinct etiologies.3,47–49
Proximal and distal colon cancers display differences in incidence
by geographic region, age and sex.3 There are also differences
between subsites with regard to pH,50 apoptotic index,3 metabo-
lism of bile acids,3 bacterial composition and bacterial metabolic
capacity51,52 and expression of carcinogen metabolizing enzymes.3
All 3 studies that reported results for subsites in the colon showed
that the positive relationship between processed meat consumption
and cancer risk was stronger for distal colon than for proximal
colon.5,8,9 In this regard, it is noteworthy that levels of the promuta-
genic lesion O6-methyldeoxyguanosine, a marker of exposure to
NOCs, have been found to be higher in tissues from the distal colon
than from the proximal colon.53

In summary, results of this meta-analysis support the hypothesis
that high consumption of red meat and processed meat may
increase the risk of colon and rectal cancer. Whether the associa-
tion with red meat or processed meat consumption varies accord-
ing to subsites in the colorectum warrants further investigation.
