Abstract

Background: Ulcerative colitis causes recurring intestinal mucosal injury and sustained inflammation, increasing the
likelihood of colorectal cancer (CRC) development. Dietary red raspberry (RB) is a rich source of phytonutrients known
to have anti-inflammatory activity; however, the role of RB on CRC prevention in chronic colitis has not been examined.
Objective: This study examined the effects of dietary RB supplementation on inflammation, epithelium repair, and
oncogenic signaling in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)–induced chronic colitis in mice.
Methods: Six-week-old male C57BL/6J mice were fed a control or RB (5% of dry feed weight; n = 12/group) diet for
10 wk. Starting from the fourth week, mice were administered 2 repeated cycles of 1% DSS (7-d DSS treatment plus
14-d recovery) and were monitored daily for disease activity index (DAI) score. Colonic tissues were collected at the
end of the study for histochemical, immunohistochemical, and biochemical analysis of inflammation, differentiation and
proliferation markers.
Results: RB supplementation reduced the DAI score and histologic damage (by 38.9%; P ≤ 0.01), expression of in-
flammatory mediators (by 20–70%; P ≤ 0.01), infiltration of CD4 T cells (by 50%; P ≤ 0.05), and α4β7 integrin and
related adhesion molecules (by 33.3%; P ≤ 0.01). Furthermore, RB supplementation facilitated epithelium repair, as
evidenced by enhanced goblet cell density, expression of transcription factors including Kruppel-like factor 4 (Klf4) and
Hairy and enhancer of split 1 (Hes1), terminal differentiation markers, mucin 2 (Muc2), and intestinal alkaline phosphatase
(by 20–200%; P ≤ 0.01). Conversely, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (by 70%; P ≤ 0.01), β-catenin, and signal trans-
ducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling (by 19–33%; P ≤ 0.05) were reduced by RB supplemen-
tation. In addition, RB supplementation enhanced p53 stability (by 53%) and reduced oncogenic gene expression
(by 50–60%).
Conclusion: RB supplementation reduced DAI score and the risk of CRC development during recurring colitis in mice,
suggesting that RB is a possible dietary supplement for patients with ulcerative colitis and related gut inflammatory
diseases. J Nutr 2018;148:667–674.

colon, which is known to increase the risk of colorectal can-
cer (CRC) development (1). CRC is the third most common
cancer in the United States and Europe and is becoming com-
mon around the world (2, 3). Repeated mucosal injury of the
intestinal epithelium results in aberrant activation of inflamma-
tory signaling and accumulation of immune cells, further am-
plifying the disease severity (1, 4). Epithelium repair or mucosal
healing is a process of coordinated interplay between inflam-
mation, cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation of ep-
ithelial cells in the intestinal epithelium (5, 6), which requires
intricate regulatory mechanisms to prevent uncontrolled prolif-
eration that eventually can lead to hyperplasia and CRC. Under
chronic inflammation, Wingless and Int (Wnt)/β-catenin and
signal transducer and activator of transcript 3 (STAT3) signaling
pathways are activated and promote epithelial cell proliferation

(7). On the contrary, the key tumor suppressor protein p53 (8,
9) is reduced under chronic inflammation and is lost in ∼50%
of malignant tumors (10).

Among cancers, CRC etiology is unique and highly affected
by diet. Western high-calorie diets with low dietary fiber and
polyphenolic compounds are known to increase CRC incidence.
Increasing fruit consumption reduces the risk of CRC and en-
hances the efficacy of anticancer drugs and therapies (11, 12),
primarily mediated by fruit’s bioactive components. Red rasp-
berry (RB) contains ∼50 different bioactive compounds (13),
including anthocyanins, ellagitannins, sanguin H-6, and lam-
bertianin C (14, 15). RB extract exerts antioxidative (16) and
anti-inflammatory activities (17). Dietary RB reduces the sever-
ity of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)–induced acute colitis in mice
(18). In addition, in vitro studies showed that RB extract in-
hibits proliferation and induces apoptosis (19, 20), but the ef-
fects of dietary whole fruit RB on CRC prevention have not been
tested. We hypothesized that dietary whole RB supplementation
reduces the risk of CRC development in mice with chronic col-
itis, likely associated with its anti-inflammatory and antiprolif-
erative properties on intestinal epithelium.

Methods
Animal care and experimental design. Six-week-old wild-
type male C57BL/6J mice were randomly assigned into 2 groups
(n = 12/group) and were fed a standard rodent diet [control (CON);
Research Diets, Inc.] or a CON diet supplemented with RB (5% of dry
feed weight; Research Diets, Inc.) for 10 wk. The pelleted diets with or
without RB were stored at −20°C under vacuum package in the dark,
and fresh diets were fed to mice weekly. The composition of RB powder
has been published previously (18), which includes ∼11 g gallic acid

equivalents/kg dry weight. The freeze-dried RB was powdered then
shipped to Research Diets, Inc., overnight for customized rodent re-
search diet preparation. Detailed information on the diet is provided
in Supplemental Tables 1 and 2. The dietary RB dose is comparable
to a 60-kg human dose of 29.0 g freeze-dried RB/d (21). The detailed
calculation is shown in our recent publication (18), in which the same
supplemental amount of RB was used.
For chronic colitis induction, after 4 wk of the dietary treatments,
mice were treated with 1% DSS (Molecular weight = 36,000–50,000
Dalton; MP Biomedicals) in drinking water for 2 repeated cycles. Each
cycle consisted of 7 d of 1% DSS treatment in water, followed by 14 d
of recovery by providing normal drinking water. Repeated cycles of DSS
exposure were used to mimic the recurring nature of colitis in human
(22). We did not include mice that were not treated with DSS, because
our previous study showed that RB supplementation has no effect on
mice that do not receive DSS treatment (18).

After receiving DSS treatment, the mice were monitored daily for
colitis symptoms during both DSS cycles. At the end of the study, the
mice were killed and colonic tissues were collected for histologic and
biochemical analyses. Mice were housed in a temperature-controlled
room with a 12-h light and 12-h dark cycle and had a free access to diet
and drinking water. There was no difference in feed intake and water
consumption. All animal procedures were approved by the Washington
State University Animal Care and Use Committee (BAF 04316-001).
Tissues were collected and processed according to the previously pub-
lished process (18).

Colitis symptom assessment and disease activity index.
During DSS induction and the recovery stages, mice under treatment
were monitored for body-weight loss, fecal consistency, and blood in
the feces with the use of the previously published scoring criteria (18,
23). The disease activity index (DAI) score was calculated as the sum of
the above 3 scores as shown in Supplemental Table 3.

Histologic assessment of colonic ulceration and goblet
cells. The fixed distal colonic tissue sections were deparaffinized and
subjected to hematoxylin and eosin staining. The pathological scores
of the distal colon were evaluated and recorded blindly with the use of
previously published scoring criteria (23, 24). For goblet cell staining,
the colonic sections were subjected to Alcian blue (pH 2.5) staining,
examined, and quantified with the use of the Image J 1.30v software
(split color channels) (National Institute of Health, USA), as described
previously (25).

Immunoblotting analysis. Immunoblotting analyses were con-
ducted per our published method (26). Band density was quantified
with the use of the Odyssey Infrared Imaging System and Image Stu-
dio Lite software (Li-Cor Biosciences) and normalized to the β-actin
content. Antibodies used in the study are listed in the Supplemental
Material.

Immunohistochemical analysis. Immunohistochemical analy-
ses were carried out as previously described (26). CD4 and in-
tegrin α4β7 antibodies are listed in the Supplemental Material.
The CD4 T cell
infiltration scores were assessed blindly accord-
ing to the distribution and degree of CD4-positive cell staining per
crypt, ranging from 0 to a maximum of 4 (0 = no cell staining,
1 = 0–25%, 2 = >25–50%, 3 = >50–75%, and 4 = >75–100% per
crypt). The α4β7 integrin filtration score was assessed blindly with the
use of the distribution of α4β7 integrin staining per crypt, ranging from
0 to 4, plus the intensity of the stain signal per whole section, ranging
from 0 to 4 (0 = no staining signal and 1 = 0–25%, 2 = >25–50%,

3 = >50–75%, and 4 = >75–100% per whole section). This results in
the total quantified score ranging from 0 to a maximum of 8/colonic
section. Nine sections per mouse at a constant interval were used for
microscopic examination and score assessment.

qRT-PCR analysis. Total RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis, and
qRT-PCR were performed as previously described (18, 25). 18s Ribo-
somal RNA was used as the reference gene. Primer sequences are listed
in Supplemental Table 4.

Statistical analysis. Data were analyzed with the use of a 2-tailed
Student’s t test. P ≤ 0.05 was considered to be significant. Each
mouse was considered as an experimental unit. Data are expressed as
means ± SEMs.

Results
Dietary RB prevents colitis symptoms and histologic
ulceration. There was no difference in the weekly body weight
between the treatment groups before DSS treatment (Supple-
mental Figure 1). RB supplementation decreased DAI scores
during both DSS treatment cycles (Figure 1A). Morphologi-
cally, RB-supplemented mice showed improved colonic archi-
tecture with less inflammation and less crypt distortion than
CON mice (Figure 1B), which was confirmed by histopathologic
scores (Figure 1B).

Dietary RB reduces inflammation and associated sig-
naling pathways. RB supplementation reduced both mRNA
expression and protein levels of IL-6 and cyclooxygenase 2
(COX-2) in colonic tissues (Figure 2A). Consistently, the mRNA
levels of Il17 and interferon γ (Ifng) in colonic tissues were also
reduced by RB supplementation (Figure 2B). The CD4 T cell
infiltration and α4β7 integrin immunohistochemical staining,
mRNA levels of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (Icam1), vas-
cular cell adhesion molecule 1 (Vcam1), mucosal vascular ad-
dressin cell adhesion molecule 1 (Madcam1), and chemokine
(C-X-C motif) ligand 1 (Cxcl1) were all reduced in the colonic
tissues of DSS-treated mice supplemented with RB (Figure 2C–
F). Collectively, these data show that RB supplementation re-
duced DSS-induced chronic inflammation and the resultant
adaptive immune responses.

Dietary RB supplementation improves epithelium repair
as indicated by enhanced differentiation of epithelial cells
in chronic colitis. Dietary RB-enhanced goblet cell density in
colonic tissues (Figure 3A), concomitant with elevated mRNA
levels of mucin 2 (Muc2) and the goblet cell differentiation
marker Kruppel-like factor 4 (Klf4), as well as intestinal alka-
line phosphatase (Alpi), a differentiation marker of enterocytes
in colonic tissues (Figure 3B). Furthermore, both mRNA and
protein levels of Hairy and enhancer of split 1 (HES1) were
enhanced, whereas those of proliferating cell nuclear antigen
(PCNA), a marker of cell proliferation, were reduced by RB sup-
plementation (Figure 3C).

Dietary RB supplementation suppresses β-catenin and
STAT3 signaling in chronic colitis. Cytosolic β-catenin has
an important role in cell adhesion and intracellular signaling,
including cell proliferation (27). RB supplementation reduced
the protein content of phosphorylated β-catenin (Ser 552) and
β-catenin and mucin 1, and enhanced E-cadherin in colonic tis-
sues (Figure 4A–B). In addition, mRNA level of mucin 1 was re-
duced (Figure 4B, C), and phosphorylation of STAT3, involved

670 Bibi et al.

in proliferation and survival of tumor cells (7), were suppressed
by RB supplementation (Figure 4D).

Dietary RB supplementation suppresses oncogenic signal-
ing via enhancing tumor suppressor p53 expression. Di-
etary RB enhanced p53 and its phosphorylation at Ser 20 and
Ser 15, as well as the content of p19ARF, a small tumor suppres-
sor protein that stabilizes p53, in colonic tissues (Figure 5A).
The mRNA expression of p21, a cyclin-dependent kinase in-
hibitor that is a downstream target of p53, was higher in the
RB-supplemented group (Figure 5B). Consistently, mRNA ex-
pression of the p53 downstream targets, antiapoptotic B cell
lymphoma 2 (Bcl2), myeloid cell leukemia 1 (Mcl1), prolifera-
tive cyclin D1 (Ccnd1), and oncogenic myelocytomatosis (Myc)
was reduced in the colonic tissues of RB-supplemented mice
(Figure 5C, D).

Discussion
Chronic colitis is characterized by active inflammation during
relapse separated by remissions, frequently with a progressive
increase in wound region and duration of the disease, which
might eventually lead to CRC occurrence (1). The consumption
of fresh fruit, vegetables, and dietary fiber is associated with a
reduced risk of CRC development (28); phytonutrients in plant
foods potentially reduce the risk of cancer via multiple mecha-
nisms (11, 12). RB is a rich source of polyphenolic compounds,
vitamins B and C, folate, and dietary fibers (13–15, 29). Dietary
RB reduced the severity of DSS-induced acute colitis (18). In
the current study, we examined the protective effects of dietary
RB against chronic colitis, which causes colonic mucosal inflam-
mation and associated epithelial dysplasia, predisposing to CRC
(22). We found that RB supplementation reduced the severity of
chronic colitis and inflammation, modulated immune responses,
enhanced epithelium repair, and reduced oncogenic signaling,
suggesting that dietary RB can reduce the risk of CRC develop-
ment in subjects with chronic colitis.

Chronic colitis is associated with increased production
of inflammatory cytokine IL-6 (30) and other inflammatory
mediators, including COX-2, IFN-γ , and CXCL1 (31, 32).
IL-17–expressing CD4 T cells are present in the intestinal
lamina propria and produce IL-17 (33). IL-17 stimulates IL-6,
which activates STAT3, mediating CD4 T cell maturation,
proliferation, and perpetuation into inflammatory intestinal
tissues (33, 34). As a result, CD4 T cells are aberrantly acti-
vated in colitis (35, 36), and express α4β7 integrin to further
attract leucocytes (37). Vedolizumab, an integrin antagonist
antibody, significantly induces mucosal healing and enhances
remission in patients with ulcerative colitis (38). In agreement,
RB supplementation reduced the expression of inflammatory
mediators, CD4 T cell density, the content of α4β7 integrin,
and adhesion molecules in chronic colitis, clearly showing
protective effects of RB on inflammation and pathological
changes of DSS-induced colitis.

Intestinal epithelium wound healing is dependent on the
homeostasis of 3 cellular processes, including restitution, pro-
liferation, and differentiation of epithelial cells into functional
cells in the injured epithelium (6). Goblet cells are one of the
differentiated functional lineages of epithelial cells that secrete
mucin 2, the major mucin of the mucosal layer shielding the
underlying epithelium from pathogenic microbes and toxic lu-
minal content (39). The depletion of goblet cells and mucin 2
is a characteristic of intestinal inflammation in inflammatory
bowel disease (40–42). Goblet cell density and mRNA expres-
sion of Muc2 and the lineage-specific differentiation factors

such as Klf4 and Hes1, along with Alpi, were heightened in
RB-supplemented mice, indicating enhanced epithelial cell dif-
ferentiation. RB supplementation also reduced cell prolifera-
tion, thus decreasing the chance of CRC development. The to-
tal content of polyphenols could be the main contributor for
these protective effects. Indeed, polyphenolic-rich grape seed
extract protects epithelial integrity by reducing proliferation
and enhancing differentiation in the intestine of IL-10–deficient
mice (41, 42); berry extracts reduce the proliferation of LNCaP
prostate cancer cells and HT-29 and HCT116 colon cancer cells
(43).

Several major signaling pathways regulate cell prolifera-
tion and differentiation, including the Wnt/β-catenin pathway.
Intestinal inflammation is known to enhance Wnt/β-catenin
signaling, which further stimulates cell proliferation and CRC
development (44). In the current study, we found that RB
supplementation reduced the β-catenin content, which is
consistent with a previous report in which dietary black rasp-
berry reduced β-catenin concentration and colonic ulceration
(45); grape seed extract supplementation downregulated the
Wnt/β-catenin pathway and proliferation in the colon of IL-10–
deficient mice (42). STAT3 transcriptionally regulates β-catenin
expression (7) and epithelial cell proliferation and survival (30);
STAT3 is activated in 50–60% of CRC (46). RB supplemen-
tation reduced STAT3 activation, which could be partially ex-
plained by the reduced production of IL-6, an upstream acti-
vator of STAT3 signaling (30). As a result, the suppression of
STAT3 and β-catenin signaling pathways reduces the risk of

CRC. In agreement with our results, the curcumin-derivative,
small-compound FLLL32 inhibited STAT3 activity, which re-
duces CRC development (47). Triptolide (a diterpenoid triepox-
ide extracted from the traditional Chinese medicinal herb) in-
hibited CRC progression associated with STAT3 suppression
(48).

Protein p53 is a tumor suppressor protein (8), which is re-
duced or lost in cancer cells (10). Phosphorylation of p53 at
Ser 15 and Ser 20 stabilizes p53 by reducing its interaction with
mouse double minute 2 (MDM2), which mediates p53 degra-
dation (49). On the other hand, p14ARF (p19ARF in mice) stabi-
lizes p53 by acting as an inhibitor of MDM2 (49). We found
that RB supplementation stabilized the p53 protein correlated
with increased phosphorylation at Ser 15 and Ser 20 and an
upregulated level of p19ARF. These changes could be due to
the biological effects of polyphenols. Green tea polyphenols,
epigallocatechin-3-gallate, stabilized p53 by inducing its phos-
phorylation at Ser 15 and Ser 20, and p14ARF mediated down-
regulation of MDM2 in human prostate carcinoma LNCaP cells
(49). p21 is a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor and one of the
p53 downstream mediators, which initiates cell cycle arrest and
interacts with PCNA to inhibit DNA replication (50). The p53
stabilization increases transcription of p21 and the expression
of proapoptotic Bax, while reducing the antiapoptotic BCL2 (9,
49). Consistently, dietary RB enhanced p21 expression and re-
duced Bcl2, Mcl1, Ccdn1, and Myc, showing that RB suppressed
epithelial cell proliferation and oncogenic signal activation in
chronic colitis.

The bioactive components in whole fruit RB include vita-
mins, minerals, fibers, antioxidants, and polyphenols (51). RB
freeze-dried powder contains anthocyanin, ellagitannins, san-
guin H-6, lambertianin C, and other polyphenols (14, 15).
RB anthocyanin supplementation reduced the production of

IL-6, IL-1β, COX-2, and inducible NO synthase, and sup-
pressed NF-κB signaling in mice (17). RB ellagic acid showed
immunoregulatory functions in various animal studies (52) and
antiproliferative and apoptotic activities in Caco-2 cells (53, 54).
In addition, RB contains 1.6% soluble fiber and 33.5% insolu-
ble fiber (51), which provide substrates for gut fermentation to
produce SCFAs and are expected to generate additional bene-
ficial effects (55). By using the whole-fruit approach, beneficial
effects of RB could be attributed to the combined effects of the
high polyphenol and fiber contents in RB.

In summary, dietary RB reduced the severity of chronic col-
itis, colonic ulceration, inflammation, and associated signaling.
RB facilitated epithelium repair by enhancing epithelial cell
differentiation and mucin 2 production, while reducing cell pro-
liferation, which were associated with reduced β-catenin and
STAT3 signaling. Moreover, dietary RB supplementation stabi-
lized the tumor suppressor p53 and reduced oncogenic signal-
ing, suggesting that RB is a potential dietary strategy to reduce
the risk of CRC development in subjects with chronic colitis.
