Abstract
Background: Estrogen receptor-negative (ER−) breast cancer tends to have poorer prognosis than estrogen receptor-
positive breast cancer. A number of studies have examined the association between diet quality as measured by various
diet quality scores and the risk of ER− breast cancer.
Objective: This systematic review aimed to summarize existing evidence on this topic.
Methods: Medline and Embase searches were conducted until 2 April 2017 for cohort and case-control studies on diet
quality scores and ER− breast cancer.
Results: We included 6 prospective cohort studies and 1 case-control study on postmenopausal ER− breast cancer: 4
from Europe and 3 from the United States. There were 12 different diet quality scores: 2 versions of the Dietary Inflam-
matory Index, 4 versions of the Mediterranean diet score, the Healthy Eating Index, the Alternate Healthy Eating Index,
the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score, and 3 versions of low-carbohydrate diet scores that differen-
tiate between different sources of protein and fat. Of the 4 studies on Mediterranean diet scores, 3 showed a significant
inverse association with postmenopausal ER− breast cancer, whereas no consistent association was observed with the
other diet quality scores. Although most diet quality scores in this review share similar food components, most of the
non-Mediterranean diet scores were represented by only 1 study each, and the associations with postmenopausal ER−
breast cancer were mixed. All studies were adjusted for multiple covariates.
Conclusion: This systematic review shows mixed results for an association between a variety of diet quality scores
and postmenopausal ER− cancer. However, results from different versions of the Mediterranean diet scores are more
consistent and suggest an inverse relation with ER− breast cancer. J Nutr 2018;148:100–108.

Introduction
Breast cancer is one of the most commonly diagnosed can-
cers in women, with the American Cancer Society estimat-
ing 252,710 new cases of invasive breast cancer in 2017 and
∼40,610 deaths (1). About 20% of breast cancers diagnosed
in the United States are estrogen receptor-negative (ER−) (2).
Reproductive factors such as nulliparity and advanced age at

first birth were more strongly associated with estrogen receptor-
positive (ER+) than ER− tumors, whereas duration of lacta-
tion is more strongly associated with a lower risk for ER+ than
for ER− tumors (3). In addition, chemo prevention using ta-
moxifen was particularly effective for reducing the risk of ER+
but not ER− tumors (4). On the other hand, after diagnosis,
ER− tumors have been associated with a worse 5-to-10-y sur-
vival rate compared with ER+ breast cancer (5–7). In one study,
ER− patients had a 1.72-times higher risk of breast cancer–
specific mortality than ER+ patients after controlling for age at

diagnosis, race, grade of cancer, tumor size, lymph node status,
radiotherapy, and year of diagnosis (7). In another study, ER−
status was associated with ∼4 times the risk of developing first
distant metastasis, especially during the first 2 y after diagno-
sis, than that of women with ER+ tumors (8). There are also
fewer treatment options for ER− breast cancers than for ER+
tumors, because these cancers do not respond to the safer and
better-tolerated endocrine treatments (9). Tamoxifen, for exam-
ple, has been shown to have little or no effect on ER− breast
cancer recurrence or mortality (10). Postmastectomy radiother-
apy also fails to improve survival in ER− patients (11).
Given the poorer prognosis and challenges of treatment, pre-
vention of ER− breast cancer is of significant public health im-
portance. While nonmodifiable factors such as parity, age at first
birth, and other hormonal factors are strong predictors for ER+
breast cancer, they have weaker associations with ER− cancer
(12, 13). Therefore, lifestyle risk factors may have a compar-
atively greater influence in the ER− subtype and, therefore, a
potential opportunity for ER− breast cancer prevention. Previ-
ous studies found a significant association between diet quality
and the risk of ER− breast cancer, but not for ER+ breast can-
cer in postmenopausal women (14, 15). Similarly, Zhang et al.
(16) found that carotenoid intake was inversely associated with
ER− but not ER+ breast cancer.

Evaluating the whole diet offers the opportunity to capture
interaction among foods and nutrients. Systematic reviews have
examined the current literature on the association between di-
etary patterns that reflect existing eating habits and the risk of
breast cancers (17–20) and found a possible inverse association,
but ER status was not distinguished. Diet quality scores are con-
structed with predetermined intake criteria and used to evalu-
ate the healthfulness of food choices (15, 21). They are gener-
ally similar in several characteristics, such as emphasis of fruits
and vegetables and de-emphasis of red and processed meats.
The only systematic review and meta-analysis on diet quality
scores was on the Mediterranean diet, and no significant asso-
ciation was noted (22). However, estrogen receptor status was
not considered in the analysis. Because there is a fair amount
of similarities between different diet quality scores, we aim to
evaluate the literature on this method of assessing the healthful-
ness of the entire diet. The purpose of the current review is to
summarize the evidence from observational studies, specifically
cohort and case-control studies, on the association of diet qual-
ity as evaluated by preestablished diet quality scores on the risk
of ER− breast cancer. Because the incidence of postmenopausal
breast cancer is ∼5 times that of premenopausal cancer (23), this
systematic review focuses on data regarding postmenopausal
women.

Methods
This review is registered on the International Prospective Register of
Systematic Reviews (24) in 2016 (PROSPERO, registration number:
42016051570), and it followed PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) reporting guidelines for sys-
tematic reviews. A literature search in Medline and Embase was con-
ducted up to 2 April 2017, and data extraction was performed by 2
reviewers (MD and CM). Year of publication was not considered for
exclusion. This systematic review focuses on predetermined (or a priori)
diet quality scores instead of data-driven dietary patterns derived from
statistical methods such as principal component analysis. The compo-
nents of the predetermined scores are more consistent across studies and
not as highly dependent on population intake. Searches for diet quality
were conducted in the following areas: diet quality, dietary guideline,

diet index, Mediterranean, DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hyper-
tension), vegan, vegetarian, plant based, healthy eating, breast cancer
or tumor or neoplasm, estrogen receptor, postmenopausal, prospective
study, and case-control study. The full search string is listed in Supple-
mental Table 1. The language was restricted to English. Abstracts, gray
literature, and unpublished results or information were not included.
The reference lists of the studies included in this systematic review were
also screened for additional studies.

Study selection. The included studies were required to be ei-
ther prospective cohort or case-control designs and were examined
for an association between diet quality scores and the incidence of
postmenopausal breast cancer with an ER− tumor type. The publica-
tions also had to include a priori–determined diet quality indexes or
scores instead of any posteriori method of identifying dietary patterns,
such as cluster or factor or reduced rank regression analysis. A hierar-
chical approach was used to select studies based on title, abstract, and
full text. Selection was conducted independently by 2 reviewers (MD
and CM) and disagreement was resolved by consensus in consultation
with a third reviewer (TF).

Quality assessment. Each study selected from the original search
was graded using quality checklists developed based on findings from
a systematic review of the available scientific literature by the Scottish
Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) (25) (Supplemental Tables
2 and 3). SIGN develops evidence-based clinical practice guidelines for
the National Health Service in Scotland. Per SIGN guidelines, separate
and designated checklists were used for cohort and case-control studies.
Study grading was completed independently by 2 reviewers (MD and
CM), and inconsistencies in grading were resolved by consensus.

Data extraction. The following information was extracted from
each study: last name of the primary author, year of publication, coun-
try or region where the study was performed, the name of the cohort
study from which the sample was taken, follow-up period (date range
of data collection and duration of study), study size, participant char-
acteristics (sex, age, and number of cases), dietary assessment method
used, exposure variable (specific dietary score examined), characteris-
tics of the diet score, RRs and 95% CIs, and variables adjusted for in
the multivariate models of each study. Two reviewers (MD and CM) in-
dividually extracted data from each study and collaborated to organize
and synthesize the data.

Results
The PRISMA flow diagram (Figure 1) illustrates the search pro-
cess. The initial search yielded 1023 articles, and after removing
50 duplicates, 973 articles were identified for abstract screening.
There were 738 publications excluded based on titles or
abstracts. The selection process yielded 35 potentially relevant
full-text publications, of which 28 studies were excluded: 12 did
not mention any dietary score in the full text; 6 used factor anal-
ysis; 2 used reduced rank regression; 5 were abstracts with no
full texts available; and 1 was a systematic review. Two publi-
cations focused on mortality in breast cancer survivors and, as
a result, were excluded. In total, 7 studies were included in this
systematic review.

Among the 7 studies included, 1 population-based case-
control study was conducted in Germany (26); 3 prospective
cohort studies were conducted in the United States [Nurses’
Health Study (NHS) (14, 15) and Women’s Health Initiative co-
hort study (21)]; and the other 3 were conducted in European
countries [European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and
Nutrition Cohort (EPIC) study (27), Swedish Women’s Lifestyle
and Health cohort study (28), and Netherlands cohort study
(29)] (Table 1). All 7 studies included women with an age range

of 30–79 y (only postmenopausal breast cancer cases were in-
cluded in this review). All studies used an FFQ for dietary as-
sessment, with the number of items ranging from 80–176. In the
EPIC study, an additional food record was combined with the
FFQ to assess dietary intake. In the cohort studies, the follow-up
time ranged from 11 to 26 y. Regression models in each study
were controlled for multiple confounders, including energy in-
take, BMI, age, physical activity, and others. The characteristics
of each study are described in Table 1, and scoring criteria for
each diet quality scores are described in Supplemental Table 4.

Dietary inflammatory index. The Dietary Inflammatory In-
dex (DII) was developed to quantify the inflammatory poten-
tial of individual diets. The 2 studies that used the DII in this
review used 25 (26) and 32 foods (21) and nutrients. Dietary
components were assigned positive or negative points depend-
ing on the data in the literature indicating their inflammatory

potential, with a higher score indicating a more inflammatory
diet (26). The DII has been shown to be associated with circu-
lating concentrations of acute-phase high-sensitivity C-reactive
protein and plasma IL-6, both indicators of systematic inflam-
matory response (26).
study of post-
menopausal breast cancer in Germany, 428 ER−/progesterone

status, and a higher DII was associated with a higher risk

Diet quality and ER− breast cancer 105

only for ER−/PR−/human epidermal growth factor 2-positive
subtype (HR comparing extreme quintiles: 2.37; 95% CI: 1.08,
5.20).

The Healthy Eating Index and the Alternate Healthy Eat-
ing Index. The Healthy Eating Index (HEI) was developed by
using the USDA Food Guide Pyramid based on the 1995 Di-
etary Guideline for Americans (30). It contains 10 food groups
and nutrients, including fruits, vegetables, grains, milk, meat,
total fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, sodium, and diet variety.
For each component, the possible score ranges from 0 to 10,
based on the level of intake, with a possible total HEI score
of 0–100. The Alternate Healthy Eating Index (AHEI) was
adapted from the HEI, and it addresses quality within food
groups. The component was modified to fruits, vegetables with-
out potatoes, nuts and soy, white-to-red meat ratio, trans fat and
polyunsaturated fat and saturated fat ratio, cereal fiber, long-
term multivitamin use, and alcohol intake, with a score range
of 0–87.5 (15). In both indexes, a higher score represents a
healthier diet.
Only one study examined the association between the HEI
or the AHEI and ER− breast cancer risk. In the US NHS, with
71,058 women with ≤18 y of follow-up and 575 ER− cases, the
HEI showed no association with ER− tumors (15). On the other
hand, a higher AHEI score showed a significant trend for a lower
risk of ER− breast cancer (RR comparing extreme quintiles:
0.78, 95% CI: 0.59, 1.04; P-trend across 5 quintiles = 0.01).

Mediterranean diet. The original Mediterranean diet index
was developed for the Greek population. It contains 8 com-
ponents, including alcohol, vegetables, fruits, legumes, cereals,
monounsaturated-to-saturated fat ratio, and dairy and meat
products. A higher score reflects a closer resemblance to the
Mediterranean diet (31). Since then, several indexes have been
developed for different populations to reflect the Mediterranean
diet. The Alternate Mediterranean Diet (32) score was an
adaptation of the Mediterranean diet score proposed by Tri-
chopoulou et al. (31).
Four cohort studies evaluated the association between the
Mediterranean diet score and ER− breast cancer risk. All 4 stud-
ies used cutoff points specific to the study population to assign
points to their version of the Mediterranean diet score. Using
data from the EPIC (European Prospective Investigation into
Cancer and Nutrition) cohort with a mean follow-up of 11 y,
Buckland et al. (27) measured resemblance to Mediterranean
diet using the adapted relative Mediterranean diet (arMed),
which did not include alcoholic beverages. The authors catego-
rized their 16-point score into low, medium, and high groups.
The high arMed was associated with a lower risk of ER−/PR−
tumors than was the arMed (high compared with low: RR: 0.80;
95% CI: 0.65, 0.99; P-trend = 0.043). In a Swedish study with
≤16 y of follow-up, a 2-point increment of a 9-point Mediter-
ranean diet score showed no clear association with ER− can-
cer (28). In the Netherlands, an 8-point, Modified Mediter-
ranean Diet Reduced score observed a 40% decreased risk (HR:
0.60; 95% CI: 0.39, 0.93; P-trend across 5 quintiles = 0.03)
in ≤20.3 y of follow-up (29). The only study from the United
States used data from the NHS, with ≤18 y of follow-up (15).
A significant inverse trend for ER− tumors was observed with
a higher Alternate Mediterranean Diet index (RR comparing
extreme quintiles: 0.79; 95% CI: 0.60–1.03; P-trend across 5
quintiles = 0.03).
106 Du et al.

Other diet quality scores: DASH or low-carbohydrate diet
scores. The DASH diet is a healthy eating pattern originally
developed to reduce blood pressure (33). The diet emphasizes
the consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins, fruits,
and vegetables. An index based on population-specific intake
has been developed to reflect adherence to the DASH diet, which
consists of 8 components: fruits, vegetables, nuts and legumes,
low-fat dairy products, whole grains, sodium, sweetened bever-
ages, and red and processed meats (14). For each component,
the score ranges from 1 to 5, based on quintiles according to in-
dividual’s intake ranking and the score range of 8 to 40 points.
The low-carbohydrate diet (LCD) is a popular diet, and
indexes have been created to reflect variations in the diet
that emphasize animal or plant proteins (34). To com-
pute the LCD score, percentages of energy from carbo-
hydrate,
fat, and protein are divided into 11 categories
based on percentiles. The percentile rankings constitute the
points assigned for each macronutrient. For fat and pro-
tein, individuals in the highest category receive the highest,
9 points, and so forth. For carbohydrate, the lowest receives
10 points, and the highest receives 0 points. The overall score
is the summation of points from carbohydrate, fat, and protein
with a range of 0–30 points.
Only one study examined these scores and the risk of ER−
breast cancer in postmenopausal women. In the US NHS with
826 ER− cases, a significant inverse trend was observed with
the DASH diet score (quintile 5 compared with quintile 1—
RR: 0.80; 95% CI: 0.64, 1.01; P-trend = 0.02) (14). How-
ever, among the 3 versions of LCDs, only the vegetable LCD
score showed an inverse trend with ER− cancer risk (RR com-
paring extreme quintiles: 0.81; 95% CI: 0.65, 1.01; P-trend =
0.03), whereas no association was observed with the overall
LCD score or the animal LCD score.

Geographic difference. Overall, the European studies showed
mixed results, with the larger studies showing a significant in-
verse relation and the smaller studies finding no association.
Data from the United States came from only 2 cohorts, and
tended to report inverse associations between dietary quality
scores and risk of postmenopausal ER− cancer (14, 15, 21). For
the various Mediterranean diet scores, slightly more consistency
was observed, with 2 out of 3 European studies (27–29) and 1
US study (15) showing a significant inverse association.

Discussion
In this systematic review, we identified 6 prospective cohort
studies and 1 case-control study that examined the association
between diet quality scores and postmenopausal ER− breast
cancer risk. The studies were large, and the magnitude of associ-
ation comparing top to bottom score categories were moderate
to strong. The most consistent inverse association was observed
for variations of the Mediterranean diet score. Studies on the
other dietary quality scores were mostly from the United States,
and results were mixed. Even though these other dietary qual-
ity scores reflect the healthfulness of the diet, the direction of
associations was inconsistent.

The various versions of Mediterranean diet scores aimed
to examine the foods consumed in the traditional diet of the
area, which generally reflected a healthy diet. The different ver-
sions of the scores were remarkably similar in the food groups
included, although there was variability in the possible score
range. This likely contributed to better consistency in results

observed when compared with the other diet quality scores. A
recent meta-analysis that examined ER− tumors using 2 studies
showed an inverse association between the Mediterranean diet
score and ER− breast cancer (15, 29). The PREDIMED (PRE-
vención con DIeta MEDiterránea) trial examined the Mediter-
ranean diet with additional extra virgin olive oil, the Mediter-
ranean diet with additional mixed nuts, and a low-fat control
arm (35). All women were postmenopausal. In 5 y of follow-
up there were 35 incident breast cancer cases, but only 2 were
confirmed ER−; 31 were confirmed ER+ and the rest were un-
known. Breast cancer incidence was significantly lower in the
Mediterranean diet + extra virgin olive oil arm (HR: 0.62, P =
0.02) when compared with the controls. The Mediterranean diet
+ mixed nuts arm showed a possible lower risk (HR: 0.62, P =
0.24), although it was not statistically significant. These results
regarding the Mediterranean diet are promising, but translating
the findings into specific recommendations for the public would
require further confirmation and more-detailed specification of
intake quantities.

Diet quality scores other than those measuring the adher-
ence of the Mediterranean diet were constructed to measure
specific dietary attributes (e.g., LCD scores) or to reflect an
overall healthy diet (e.g., HEI and AHEI). Therefore, their
characteristics ranged from those that emphasized fruits and
vegetables while discouraging red and processed meats (e.g.,
HEI and DASH), to focusing on specific nutrients (e.g., LCDs).
In addition, the number of score components ranged from 8 in
the DASH (15) score to 32 in one of the DIIs (21). These varia-
tions likely contributed to the inconsistent results observed for
these other diet quality scores.

The studies included were high-quality observational stud-
ies. Each was controlled for multiple confounders, although
residual confounding cannot be completely avoided. The co-
hort studies had a minimum follow-up of 11 y, and the smallest
study had nearly 50,000 participants at the beginning of follow-
up. Therefore, there was a substantial amount of time for cases
to develop. Nevertheless, ER− tumors are not the predominant
type in breast cancer cases, and so there was some constraint
on statistical power. Dietary information was self-reported us-
ing validated FFQs. While some amount of inaccuracy in re-
porting cannot be avoided and the FFQ cannot precisely deter-
mine absolute intake, the FFQs used were validated and were
adequate in ranking individuals according to their level of in-
take (36). In all studies, ER− breast cancer cases were identified
or confirmed through cancer registries, or clinical or pathology
records.
A healthy diet may reduce the development of ER− breast
cancer through several mechanisms. The abundance of dietary
fiber, antioxidants, and vitamins may suppress inflammatory
responses, neutralize free radicals, and prevent DNA damage
(37, 38). The favorable association may also be mediated by
weight management because higher adiposity has been identi-
fied as a risk factor of breast cancer. In addition, the Mediter-
ranean diet has been shown to improve insulin resistance and
glycemic control (39), which are more strongly associated with
ER− than with ER+ breast cancer (40, 41).

Out of the 8 diet quality scores examined in the studies in-
cluded in this review, 6 showed a significant inverse associa-
tion with ER− breast cancer. In addition to the heterogeneity
of score construction, the mixed results might be due to rel-
evant diet components not captured by these scores, residual
confounding, or a true null association between the diet quality
scores investigated and risk of postmenopausal ER− breast can-
cer. Additional studies are needed to determine what healthy diet

characteristics are most strongly associated with a lower risk of
ER− breast cancer.

The primary limitation of this review is the few number of
studies for each diet score. Although there were 7 studies, none
of the diet scores was examined in >2 studies except for the
Mediterranean diet score, and the heterogeneity of score con-
struction made it difficult to compare the results across studies.
Whereas most studies included were cohort studies, one study
used a case-control study design. In addition, results were based
on different categorization of diet quality scores and reference
groups. The studies in this systematic review are observational
studies; therefore, causal relationships cannot be directly es-
tablished. There may also be some level of recall bias in the
case-control study included in this review because cases were
interviewed after cancer diagnosis.

In conclusion, this systematic review showed mixed results
for an association between a variety of diet quality scores and
postmenopausal ER− cancer. However, results from versions of
the Mediterranean diet scores were more consistent in suggest-
ing an inverse association.
