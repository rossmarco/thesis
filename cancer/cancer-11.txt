 Background  

 Methods  

 Results  

 The  General  Population  Nutrition  Intervention  Trial  was  a  randomized  primary  esophageal  and  gastric 
cancer prevention trial conducted from 1985 to 1991, in which 29 584 adult participants in Linxian, China, 
were  given  daily  vitamin  and  mineral  supplements.  Treatment  with  “factor  D,”  a  combination  of 
50   µ g  selenium,  30  mg  vitamin  E,  and  15  mg  beta-carotene,  led  to  decreased  mortality  from  all  causes, 
cancer overall   , and gastric cancer. Here, we present 10-year follow-up after the end of active intervention.  

 Participants were assessed by periodic data collection, monthly visits by village health workers, and quar-
terly review of the Linxian Cancer Registry. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the 
cumulative effects of four vitamin and mineral supplementation regimens were calculated using adjusted 
proportional hazards models.  

 Through  May  31,  2001,  276  participants  were  lost  to  follow-up;  9727  died,  including  3242  from  cancer 
(1515 from esophageal cancer and 1199 from gastric cancer). Participants who received factor D had lower 
overall mortality (HR   =   0.95, 95% CI   =   0.91 to 0.99;  P    =   .009; reduction in cumulative mortality from 33.62% 
to 32.19%) and gastric cancer mortality (HR   =   0.89, 95% CI   =   0.79 to 1.00;  P    =   .043; reduction in cumulative 
gastric cancer mortality from 4.28% to 3.84%) than subjects who did not receive factor D. Reductions were 
mostly  attributable  to  benefits  to  subjects  younger  than  55  years.  Esophageal  cancer  deaths  between 
those  who  did  and  did  not  receive  factor  D  were  not  different  overall;  however,  decreased  17%  among 
participants younger than 55  (HR   =   0.83, 95% CI   =   0.71 to 0.98;  P    =   .025) but increased 14% among those 
aged 55 years or older (HR   =   1.14, 95% CI   =   1.00 to 1.30;  P    =   .47). Vitamin A and zinc supplementation was 
associated with increased total and stroke mortality; vitamin C and molybdenum supplementation, with 
decreased stroke mortality.  

 Conclusion  

 The  beneficial  effects  of  selenium,  vitamin  E,  and  beta-carotene  on  mortality  were  still  evident  up  to 
10  years  after  the  cessation  of  supplementation  and  were  consistently  greater  in  younger  participants. 
Late effects of other supplementation regimens were also observed.

                    With incidence rates exceeding 100 per 10 000 person-years, the 
people of Linxian, China, have some of the highest rates of esopha-
geal squamous cell carcinoma and gastric cardia adenocarcinoma 
in the world ( 1 , 2 ). Several studies in the early 1980s showed that 
nutritional  deficiencies  were  common  in  this  area,  suggesting  a 
link between these deficiencies and the high cancer rates ( 3 ). The 
Linxian General Population Nutrition Intervention Trial (NIT), a 
large-scale,  randomized,  double-blind,  primary  prevention  trial, 
was designed to test the efficacy of four combinations of vitamins 
and  minerals  in  reducing  esophageal  and  gastric  cardia  cancer 
incidence and mortality in Linxian ( 4  –  6 ). The results of this trial, 
which  started  March  1,  1986,  and  concluded  May  31,  1991, 
showed that supplementation with the antioxidant combination of 
selenium,  vitamin  E,  and  beta-carotene  statistically  significantly 
reduced total mortality, total cancer mortality, and gastric cancer 
mortality ( 5 ). The identification of statistically significant effects 

raises  questions  about  the  durability  of  these  effects  and  also 
potential good or bad late effects related to supplementation.

  CONTEXT  AND  CAVEATS 

  Prior knowledge 
 The undernourished population of Linxian, China, has high rates of 
cancer  of  the  esophagus  and  gastric  cardia.  In  the  General 
Population Nutrition Intervention Trial of 1985 – 1991, 29 584 Linxian 
villagers aged 40 – 69 years were given daily supplements of one or 
more of four vitamin and mineral combinations. “Factor D,” which 
contained selenium, vitamin E, and beta-carotene, was associated 
with  reduced  mortality  overall,  from  cancer,  and  from  gastric 
cancer.  

  Study design 
 For 15-year follow-up, villagers were interviewed monthly concern-
ing their health and registered cancer deaths were reviewed to look 
for  sustained  and  delayed  effects  of  the  vitamin  supplements. 
Hazard  ratios  for  death  by  cancer,  stroke  and  other  causes  were 
calculated for the four supplement combinations.  

  Contribution 
 Ten years after the end of the trial, participants who took factor D 
still  had  a  5%  reduction  in  total  mortality  and  11%  reduction  in 
gastric cancer; these effects were concentrated among participants 
younger than 55 years. Esophageal cancer decreased 17% in par-
ticipants younger than 55 years, but increased 14% in those older 
than 55 years.  

  Implications 
 Sustained  benefits  were  associated  with  a  combination  of  sele-
nium, vitamin E, and beta-carotene supplementation. More subtle 
long-term  effects  were  also  observed 
for  other  vitamin 
supplements.  

  Limitations 
 It  is  not  known  which  items  in  the  supplement  combination  are 
responsible  for  the  combined  effect.  Because  the  study  was  pre-
formed  in  a  nutritionally  deprived  population  with  high  rates  of 
esophageal and gastric cancer, the findings might not be applica-
ble  to  other  populations.  It  is  possible  that  the  findings  could  be 
biased  by  a  general  improvement  in  nutrition  among  the  partici-
pants over the postintervention period. 

   

 From the Editors   

 Since the conclusion of active trial treatment in 1991, follow-up 
has  continued  on  all  participants  to  collect  data  on  cancer  inci-
dence and all-cause mortality. Here we report mortality results for 
the total 15.25 years of the trial and posttrial follow-up (through 
May 31, 2001) for the original a priori trial endpoints, that is, the 
effects of the intervention agents on esophageal and gastric cardia 
cancer mortality, and for all-cause mortality. 

  Subjects and Methods 
  Design of the Trial and Posttrial Follow-up 
 The design and conduct of the Linxian General Population NIT 
and its extended follow-up have been described elsewhere ( 4  –  6 ). In 
brief, participants were recruited in 1985 from four northern com-
munes  in  Linxian,  a  rural  county  in  Henan  Province.  Residents 
40 – 69 years of age with no history of cancer or debilitating disease 
were eligible for this trial and were asked to enroll. In all, 29 584 

subjects, 60% of those invited, were randomly assigned in the trial. 
These individuals were interviewed for medical history, family his-
tory of cancer, diet, and alcohol and tobacco consumption; were 
given a brief medical exam; and were asked to donate 10-mL blood 
sample. 

 The  nine  nutrients  studied  in  this  trial  and  their  daily  doses 
were retinol (5000 IU, as retinol palmitate), zinc (22.5 mg, as zinc 
oxide), riboﬂ avin (3.2 mg), niacin (40 mg), ascorbic acid (120 mg), 
molybdenum  (30   µ g,  as  molybdenum  yeast  complex),  selenium 
(50   µ g,  as  selenium  yeast),  alpha-tocopherol  (30  mg),  and  beta-
carotene  (15  mg).  Doses  ranged  from  one  to  two  times  US  Rec-
ommended Daily Allowances. An independent study of each of these 
nutrients  and  vitamins,  although  desirable,  was  not  practical. 
Therefore, these nine nutrients were combined into four regimens 
or factors: retinol and zinc (factor A); riboﬂ avin and niacin (factor B); 
vitamin C and molybdenum (factor C); and selenium, vitamin E, 
and beta-carotene (factor D). 

 The trial had a one-half 2 4  fractional factorial design, so partici-
pants  were  randomly  assigned  by  a  computer-generated  random 
numbers list to take one of eight combinations of the four factors. 
These eight intervention groups (treatment arms) were deﬁ ned by 
the following combinations of factors: ABCD, AB, AC, AD, BC, 
BD, CD, or placebo. With this design, half the subjects received 
and half did not receive each of the four factors (eg, half received 
and half did not receive factor A). 

 Supplements were distributed in coded pill bottles from March 
1, 1986, to May 1, 1991. Throughout the trial, the pill codes were 
kept in a secured ﬁ le at the study data management center in the 
United States and were available only to the study data manager. 
During the trial period, village health workers visited participants 
monthly to deliver pills, assess pill compliance, and ascertain vital 
and  disease  status.  Diagnostic  materials  (case  records,  pathology 
slides, and X-rays) for 85% of the cancer cases in the trial period 
were  available  and  were  reviewed  by  a  panel  of  American  and 
Chinese experts. In the subsequent 10 years posttrial, village health 
workers  or  study  interviewers  continued  to  contact  participants 
monthly. For new cancer diagnoses and deaths, diagnostic materi-
als were collected and cancer diagnoses were veriﬁ ed by the panel 
of American and Chinese experts (1991 to 1996) or senior Chinese 
diagnosticians from Beijing (1996 – 2001). Throughout the trial and 
the  posttrial  follow-up,  case  ascertainment  was  considered  com-
plete and loss to follow-up minimal (n   =   276, or <1%). Outcomes 
for  this  study  were  based  on  data  from  the  full  15.25  years  of 
follow-up, from March 1, 1986 (the start of intervention), through 
May  31,  2001  (10  years  after  the  intervention  ended).  Due  to 
delayed ascertainment of outcomes, the number of deaths reported 
here for the intervention period is higher than that in our original 
report. 

 Compliance,  measured  by  pill  disappearance  rates  and  bio-
chemical  measurements,  was  excellent.  The  overall  pill  disap-
pearance  rate  was  93%,  with  no  differences  by  treatment  arm 
(range    =    92% to 93%). Blood was analyzed in quarterly surveys 
of  a  sample  of  participants  for  retinol,  beta-carotene,  ascorbic 
acid, and glutathione reductase activation coefﬁ cient as a measure 
of  riboﬂ avin  status,  and  during  the  trial  period  all  values  were 
consistently  statistically  signiﬁ cantly  different  between  treated 
and untreated individuals (all  P  values < .001) ( 4 , 5 ).

 The  conduct  of  the  Linxian  General  Population  NIT  was 
approved by the institutional review boards of the Cancer Institute 
of  Chinese  Academy  of  Medical  Sciences  and  the  US  National 
Cancer Institute, and written informed consent was obtained from 
all  participants  for  participation.  The  trial  was  registered  as 
ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00342654.  

  Statistical Methods 
 The main outcomes of this study were esophageal and gastric car-
dia  cancer  mortality  and  total  mortality.  Participants  were  cen-
sored  at  their  last  known  follow-up  date,  date  of  death,  or  the 
administrative closure of follow-up for the study (May 31, 2001), 
whichever came first. The 15.25-year follow-up period was ana-
lyzed  as  a  whole  and  in  three  5-year  periods:  the  trial  period 
(March 1, 1986, to May 31, 1991) when the intervention agents 
were given and two other periods (June 1, 1991, to May 31, 1996, 
and June 1, 1996, to May 31, 2001) when active follow-up contin-
ued  but  no  additional  intervention  was  performed.  Among  the 
cancers,  both  esophageal  squamous  cell  carcinoma  and  gastric 
cardia adenocarcinoma occur at epidemic rates in this population, 
share  some  etiologic  risk  factors,  and  before  widespread  use  of 
endoscopy and biopsy, were diagnosed as a single disease referred 
to  as  “esophageal  cancer”  or  “hard  of  swallowing  disease”  ( 7 ). 
Through  2001,  esophageal  adenocarcinoma  was  nonexistent  in 
Linxian.  We  present  data  for  the  effects  of  the  supplements  on 
mortality  of  esophageal  squamous  cell  carcinoma,  gastric  cardia 
adenocarcinoma, gastric noncardia adenocarcinoma, and the com-
bination of esophageal and gastric cardia cancer (the original hard 
of swallowing disease). 

 We tabulated baseline frequencies and percentages of partici-
pants  by  demographics.  We  compared  risk  between  those  who 
received each factor and those who did not. In the analysis of facto-
rial trials, this kind of analysis is known as “at the margins analysis” 

and has the most power to examine the effect of each factor ( 8 ). 
Cox  proportional  hazards  models  were  used  to  calculate  hazard 
ratios (HRs) and 95% conﬁ dence intervals (95% CIs) for each fac-
tor, adjusting for the other three treatment factors, sex, age (con-
tinuous),  and  commune  (four  communes).  These  analyses  were 
conducted on 29 559 of 29 584 initial study participants; 25 were 
lost  to  follow-up  before  the  intervention  began  ( Figure  1 ). 
Interactions between each of the factors and age group or sex were 
examined by including appropriate terms in the Cox models. This 
testing of interactions between each of the treatments (factors) and 
age and sex was planned a priori ( 9 , 10 ) The 55-year age cut point 
was  chosen  because  it  is  the  midpoint  in  the  40-  to  69-year  age 
distribution  of  the  trial  population.  Kaplan – Meier  estimates  of 
cumulative event rates were plotted to compare time to death for 
each factor, for all subjects, and by sex and age group ( 11 ). In addi-
tion  to  “pure”  risks  determined  from  Cox  models  and  Kaplan –
 Meier estimates, we also estimated selected “crude” risks without 
adjustment for covariates (ie, cumulative incidence), analogous to 
the  approach  of  Fine  and  Gray  ( 12 ).  The  pure  cumulative  risks 
slightly exceeded the crude cumulative risks, as expected (data not 
shown). Indeed, the estimated pure risks exceeded the crude risk 
by no more than 0.01 for total mortality, total cancer mortality, 
gastric cancer mortality, and esophageal cancer mortality. To esti-
mate  the  calendar  time – speciﬁ c  hazard  ratios  for  the  ﬁ gures,  we 
calculated smoothed (moving) hazard ratio estimates using a gen-
eralized  additive  model  with  a  local  regression  (loess)  smoother 
with span 0.4 and a test-based conﬁ dence band.     

 The assumption of a constant treatment hazard ratio across the 
three study periods was veriﬁ ed for each of the analyses by examin-
ing  treatment  by  time  period  interactions.  All   P   values  are  two-
sided  and   P   values  less  than  .05  were  considered  statistically 
signiﬁ cant. Analyses were conducted using SAS version 9.1.3 ser-
vice pack 4 (SAS Institute, Inc, Cary, NC); ﬁ gures were produced

  Results 
 Through May 31, 2001, there were 381 954 total person-years of 
follow-up over a median of 15.25 years of observation. The base-
line  demographic  characteristics,  smoking  and  alcohol  use,  and 
family history of esophageal cancer for all subjects are shown in 
 Table 1 . As expected, there were no statistically significant differ-
ences  between  any  of  these  baseline  characteristics  by  treatment 
group assignments. Smoking prevalence was comparable and alco-
hol  consumption  was  much  less  common  than  in  the  United 
States.  A  family  history  of  esophageal  cancer  was  substantially 
more common than in the West.     

 Total and cause-speciﬁ c numbers of deaths for the entire study 
period and for the three 5-year periods are shown in  Table 2 . A 
total  of  9727  deaths  were  reported  during  the  15.25  years  of 
follow-up. Deaths due to cancer and cerebrovascular diseases each 
accounted  for  approximately  one-third  of  the  total  deaths.  The 
most common speciﬁ c causes of death were cerebrovascular events 
(n    =    2984),  esophageal  cancer  (n    =    1515),  and  gastric  cancer 
(n   =   1199). Total numbers of deaths were 2528 in the trial period 
(follow-up  period  1),  3555  in  follow-up  period  2,  and  3644  in 
follow-up period 3.     

 Adjusted hazard ratios (95% conﬁ dence intervals) for the asso-
ciations  between  each  intervention  factor  and  total  and  cause-
speciﬁ c  deaths  for  the  entire  study  period  and  for  each  of  the 
5-year follow-up periods are also shown in  Table 2 . Subjects given 
factor A (retinol and zinc) had a marginally increased risk of total 
mortality for the total follow-up period (HR   =   1.04, 95% CI   =   1.00 
to 1.09;  P    =   .035) compared with subjects not given factor A. In the

factor  A  group,  the  hazard  ratio  point  estimate  for  total  deaths 
remained  consistently  higher  than  unity  in  all  three  follow-up 
periods,  with  period-speciﬁ c  estimates  of  1.03,  1.05,  and  1.05, 
respectively,  although  none  of  the  period-speciﬁ c  estimates  was 
statistically signiﬁ cant. This increased risk was mainly due to the 
effect of factor A on noncancer deaths: The hazard ratio for cere-
brovascular deaths was 1.08 (95% CI   =   1.00 to 1.16;  P    =   .045) and 
for other causes of death was 1.06 (95% CI   =   0.99 to 1.13;  P    =   .088). 
The  hazard  ratio  point  estimates  associated  with  these  causes  of 
death  remained  higher  than  unity  (although  not  statistically  sig-
niﬁ cant) for all three follow-up periods. Neither sex (interaction 
 P    =   .372) nor age group (interaction  P    =   .757) statistically signiﬁ -
cantly modiﬁ ed the effect of factor A on total mortality. Factor A 
was also associated with period-speciﬁ c protective effects for other 
cancer  deaths  in  period  2  (HR    =    0.76,  95%  CI    =    0.58  to  1.00;  
P     =    .050)  and  for  cardia  cancer  deaths  in  period  3  (HR    =    0.73, 
95%  CI    =    0.57  to  0.93;   P     =    .012),  although  neither  effect  was 
consistent in the other time periods. 

 Intervention  with  factor  B  (riboﬂ avin  and  niacin)  was  not 
associated  with  total  deaths  in  the  overall  (HR    =    0.98,  95% 
CI    =    0.94  to  1.02;   P     =    .318)  or  period-speciﬁ c  analyses  when 
compared with lack of factor B, and hazard ratio point estimates 
remained close to 1 in all three follow-up periods ( Table 2 ). This 
factor was not associated with cause-speciﬁ c deaths overall or in 
any follow-up period, except for a marginally statistically signiﬁ -
cant protective effect on total cancer deaths in follow-up period 
2  (HR    =    0.89,  95%  CI    =    0.80  to  1.00;   P     =    .043).  The  effect 
of  factor  B  on  total  deaths  was  not  statistically  signiﬁ cantly 
modiﬁ ed by sex (interaction  P    =   .177) or age group (interaction 
 P    =   .109). 

 Factor C (vitamin C and molybdenum) was not associated with 
total deaths in overall (HR   =   0.97, 95% CI   =   0.94 to 1.01;  P    =   .177) 
or period-speciﬁ c analyses when compared with lack of factor C 
( Table 2 ). However, this factor was inversely associated with over-
all risk of cerebrovascular deaths (HR   =   0.92, 95% CI   =   0.86 to 
0.99;  P    =   .023), an effect not seen during the trial period but which 
became  apparent  during  later  follow-up.  There  were  no  statisti-
cally  signiﬁ cant  associations  between  factor  C  and  total  cancer 
mortality, esophageal or gastric cancer mortality, or other causes 
of mortality in the overall or period-speciﬁ c analyses, although a 
marginally  statistically  insigniﬁ cant  increase  in  the  combined 
esophageal and cardia cancer mortality endpoint was noted in the 
overall analysis (HR   =   1.08, 95% CI   =   1.00 to 1.17;  P    =   .052). Sex 
did not modify the effect of factor C on total mortality (interaction 
 P    =   .290), but there was a statistically signiﬁ cant interaction with 
age (interaction  P    =   .003) such that younger (<55 years at random 
assignment)  participants  had  reduced  risk  (HR  =  0.89,  95% 
CI = 0.83 to 0.96;  P    =   .001) and older ( ≥ 55 years at random assign-
ment) participants were unaffected (HR   =   1.01, 95% CI   =   0.97 to 
1.06;  P    =   .607). Statistically signiﬁ cant age group interactions were 
also seen for factor C with total cancer mortality and esophageal 
cancer  mortality;  younger  patients  were  unaffected  but  older 
participants had elevated hazard ratios ( Table 3 ).     

 Factor D (selenium, vitamin E, and beta-carotene) reduced total 
mortality (HR   =   0.95, 95% CI   =   0.91 to 0.99;  P    =   .009; reduction in 
cumulative  mortality  from  33.62%  in  the  no – factor  D  group  to 
32.19% in the factor D group). Moving hazard ratio curves ( Figure 2 )

show the smoothed hazard ratios remained less than 1.0 for most of 
the 15.25 years of observation, indicating a protective effect during 
most  of  this  period.  The  estimated  hazard  ratios  for  the  three 
follow-up periods were 0.91 (95% CI   =   0.84 to 0.99;  P    =   .023), 0.99

 P     =    .046),  respectively  ( Table  2 ).  The  hazard  ratios  for  the  three 
major group causes of mortality for the full 15.25 years of follow-up 

were also less than 1.0 but were not uniformly statistically signiﬁ cant: 
0.95 (95% CI   =   0.89 to 1.02;  P    =   .148) for cancer, 0.98 (95% CI   =   
0.98  to  1.05;   P     =    .613)  for  cerebrovascular  events,  and  0.92  (95% 
CI   =   0.86 to 0.98;  P    =   .013) for other causes. The majority of the 
overall effect was attributed to a reduced risk of death from gastric 
cancer  and  causes  of  death  other  than  cancer  or  cerebrovascular 
diseases.

   ‡     HRs (95% CIs) adjusted for the other three treatments factors, age (continuous), sex, and commune (four communes).   

 The effect of factor D on total mortality was not modiﬁ ed by sex 
(interaction   P     =    .843),  but  was  modiﬁ ed  by  age  group  (interaction 
 P    =   .024). Total and age-speciﬁ c cumulative event and moving hazard 
ratio curves presented in  Figure 2  show cumulative mortality by factor 
D.  The  hazard  ratios  were  0.95  (95%  CI    =    0.91  to  0.99; 
 P    =   .009) for all study subjects, 0.88 (95% CI   =   0.82 to 0.95;  P  < .001) 

for  subjects  younger  than  55  years  old  at  study  entry,  and  0.98 
(95% CI = 0.94 to 1.03;  P    =   .367) for subjects 55 or older at study entry 
( Table 3 ). Therefore, virtually the entire effect of factor D on total 
mortality was due to effects in individuals younger than 55 years.

mortality ( Figure 4 ), and esophageal cancer mortality ( Figure 5 ) all 
show that the effects of factor D were predominantly or exclusively 
in subjects younger than 55 years. The hazard ratios for total can-
cer mortality associated with factor D were 0.95 (95% CI   =   0.89 to 
1.02;   P     =    .148)  for  all  subjects,  0.85  (95%  CI    =    0.76  to  0.95; 
 P    =   .003) for those younger than 55, and 1.02 (95% CI   =     ⫺ 0.94 to 
1.12;   P     =    .976)  for  those  55  or  older  ( Table  3 ).  Corresponding 
hazard ratios for gastric cancer mortality were 0.89 (95% CI   =   0.79 
to 1.00;  P    =   .043), 0.83 (95% CI   =   0.69 to 1.00;  P    =   .046), and 0.93 
(95% CI   =   0.80 to 1.07;  P    =   .307). Cumulative crude gastric cancer 
mortality  for  all  subjects  was  4.28%  in  the  no – factor  D  group 
compared with 3.84% in the factor D group, an overall reduction 
of 0.44%. For esophageal cancer mortality, effect modiﬁ cation by 
age was even more pronounced. There was no overall association 
between factor D and esophageal cancer mortality for all subjects 
(HR   =   1.01, 95% CI   =   .91 to 1.11;  P    =   .905); however, in subjects 
younger  than  55  years,  factor  D  esophageal  cancer  mortality 
decreased (HR   =   0.83, 95% CI   =   0.71 to 0.98;  P    =   .025), whereas 
in individuals aged 55 years or older, it increased (HR   =   1.14, 95% 
CI   =   1.00 to 1.30;  P    =   .047) ( Table 3 ).              

  Discussion 
 The initial results of the Linxian General Population NIT, pub-
lished in 1993, showed no association between factors A, B, or C 
and  overall  mortality,  total  cancer  mortality,  or  mortality  from 

esophageal  or  gastric  cancers  ( 5 ).  However,  factor  D,  which 
included selenium, vitamin E, and beta-carotene, statistically sig-
nificantly reduced total mortality, total cancer mortality, and mor-
tality  from  gastric  cancer  ( 5 ).  An  important  question  remained, 
however,  whether  the  preventive  effects  of  factor  D  would  last 
beyond  the  trial  period.  The  results  of  the  continued  follow-up 
show  that  hazard  ratios,  as  indicated  by  moving  hazard  ratio 
curves, remained less than 1.0 for each of these endpoints for the 
majority of the follow-up period; 10 years after completion of the 
trial, the group that received factor D still showed a 5% reduction 
in total mortality and an 11% reduction in gastric cancer mortality. 
Overall, one in 70 people who took factor D was spared death from 
all causes, and one in 227 was spared death from gastric cancer. 

 Stratiﬁ cation  of  results  by  sex  and  age  was  planned  a  priori. 
There  were  no  statistically  signiﬁ cant  interactions  with  sex. 
However, when stratiﬁ ed by age, factor D had a strong protective 
effect in individuals younger than 55 years but almost no effect on 
subjects aged 55 years or older. This pattern was seen consistently 
for total mortality, total cancer mortality, gastric cancer mortality, 
and esophageal cancer mortality. Indeed, the effect of factor D on 
esophageal cancer was reversed by age, showing a protective effect 
for younger but a harmful effect for older individuals. 

 Because  this  trial  provided  selenium,  vitamin  E,  and  beta-
carotene as one factor, it was not possible to disentangle the effects 
of  these  three  supplements.  However,  observational  case – cohort 
studies  using  subjects  in  this  cohort  and  patients  with  upper

gastrointestinal tract cancers that developed during the interven-
tion period showed inverse associations between risk of esophageal 
cancer and baseline serum levels of selenium and alpha-tocopherol, 
but  not  beta-carotene  ( 13  –  15 ).  Higher  baseline  serum  selenium 
also was associated with reduced risk of gastric cardia cancer ( 13 ). 
These results suggest that the protective effects seen in the ran-
domized trial were due to the selenium and vitamin E components. 
In a subcohort of 1103 subjects from this trial followed through 
May  31,  2001,  higher  baseline  serum  selenium  levels  also  were 
associated  with  statistically  signiﬁ cant  reductions  in  esophageal 
and  gastric  cardia  cancer  mortality  ( 16 ).  A  separate  randomized 
controlled trial in Linxian ( 17 ) gave further support for a preven-
tive  effect  of  selenium  in  subjects  with  preexisting  esophageal 
squamous dysplasia, the precursor lesion of esophageal squamous 
cell carcinoma. Compared with control subjects, those with mild 
dysplasia who received 10 months of daily supplementation with 
200  µ g of selenomethionine were more likely to have regression 
and less likely to have progression of their esophageal squamous 
dysplasia. 

 In addition to evaluating the durability of the beneﬁ cial effects 
observed  during  the  trial  period  for  factor  D,  we  also  evaluated 
other postintervention events in this trial to look for late effects, 
and  several  were  noted.  When  the  full  15.25  years  of  follow-up 
were  considered,  nutritional  supplementation  with  factor  A 
(vitamin A and zinc) was associated with increased total mortality, 
mainly due to an increase in stroke deaths among subjects given 

factor  A  compared  with  those  who  were  not  given  factor  A, 
whereas supplementation with factor C (vitamin C and molybde-
num) was associated with a decrease in stroke deaths and with a 
slight increase in esophageal/cardia cancer deaths. 

 Increased mortality among factor A recipients was not expected, 
given  the  low  retinol  levels  of  the  population  at  the  start  of  the 
trial, the modest doses of both vitamin A and zinc, and the gener-
ally null or protective results from previous observational studies 
in this cohort relating high serum retinol and tissue zinc concen-
trations  to  various  cancer  endpoints  ( 15 , 18 ).  In  fact,  a  previous 
analysis of stroke (the main contributor to the observed increase in 
total mortality) in this trial showed a protective effect for persons 
who took the combination of factor A and factor D (HR    =    0.71, 
95% CI    =    0.50 to 1.00, for group AD vs placebo) ( 19 ). 

 We were surprised that factor C, a combination of vitamin C 
and molybdenum, appeared to be associated with increased risk for 
the  combined  esophageal  and  cardia  cancer  endpoint,  given  the 
well-known  role  of  vitamin  C  as  an  antioxidant  and  inhibitor  of 
carcinogenic  N -nitroso compound production in the stomach ( 20 ). 
Furthermore,  many  epidemiological  studies  have  shown  reduced 
risk  of  these  cancers  in  persons  with  high  consumption  of  fruits 
and vegetables and rich sources of vitamin C, and the only pro-
spective  study  of  plasma  vitamin  C  and  gastric  cancer  showed  a 
protective effect for high concentrations ( 21 ). No similar prospec-
tive studies of plasma vitamin C values in esophageal cancer are 
known.

 The  decreased  risk  of  stroke  among  trial  participants  who 
received factor C was not wholly unexpected. Higher plasma vita-
min C levels have been associated with reduced risk of stroke in 
prospective epidemiological studies ( 22  –  24 ), although randomized 
trials that have included vitamin C as part of an antioxidant vitamin 
treatment  arm  have  not  shown  any  effect  ( 25 , 26 ).  There  are  no 
data on molybdenum and stroke. 

 The effects of vitamin and mineral supplements on reduction of 
total  mortality  and  cancer  mortality  have  been  heavily  debated 
over the past 25 years. The results of this study need to be inter-
preted in the context of other trials of vitamin and mineral supple-
mentation. By the 1980s, it was established that antioxidants could 
quench free oxygen radicals and potentially reduce the risk of can-
cer by preventing DNA damage by these radicals. Observational 
epidemiological studies showed inverse associations between can-
cer incidence and dietary intake of several vitamins and minerals, 
but more deﬁ nitive evidence awaited the completion of random-
ized  trials  ( 27 ).  It  was  generally  assumed  that  prescribing  pills 
would be a more convenient and acceptable way to prevent cancer 
than proscribing carcinogens. These facts and assumptions moti-
vated the design and conduct of the ﬁ rst generation of randomized 
controlled cancer prevention trials, including the Linxian General 
Population NIT, to reduce cancer risk using vitamins and miner-
als. The results of the largest and most informative of these trials 
(ie, those with more than 10 000 participants) were often contrary 
to the initial expectations. Beta-carotene supplementation increased 

total  mortality  in  both  the  Alpha-Tocopherol,  Beta-Carotene 
(ATBC) Cancer Prevention Study ( 28 ) and the beta-CArotene and 
Retinol Efﬁ cacy Trial (CARET) Study ( 29 ), whereas no mortality 
beneﬁ t  for  beta-carotene  was  seen  in  either  The  Physicians ’  
Health Study (PHS) ( 30 ) or the Women ’ s Health Study ( 31 ). The 
most likely explanation for the unexpected ﬁ ndings from these four 
large trials conducted in the West is a mismatch of the design of 
the trials with the population attributes: each of these trials tested 
pharmacological doses of micronutrients in already well-nourished 
populations ( 32 ). 

 A recent meta-analysis of randomized trials of antioxidant sup-
plements  for  prevention  of  cancer  and  other  diseases  ( 33 )  com-
bined  the  results  of  these  large-scale  studies  with  many  smaller 
studies and concluded that treatment with beta-carotene, vitamin A, 
or vitamin E likely increased total mortality, and the effect of vita-
min C or selenium on total mortality needed further study. The 
results of this study agree in part with the meta-analysis conclu-
sions. In this trial, factor A (which included vitamin A) increased 
mortality, factor C (which included vitamin C) was not associated 
with  overall  mortality,  and  factor  D  (which  included  selenium) 
decreased mortality. However, beta-carotene and vitamin E, two 
supplements that were associated with increased mortality risk in 
the  meta-analysis,  were  in  factor  D,  which  reduced  mortality  in 
this trial. Several potential explanations exist for these apparently 
discrepant results. First, the protective effect of selenium may have 
been stronger than the possible deleterious effects of beta-carotene

and  vitamin  E  in  this  trial,  so  the  overall  effect  of  factor  D  was 
beneﬁ cial.  This  hypothesis  is  supported  by  medium-sized  trials 
that have shown beneﬁ cial effects for selenium in reducing mortal-
ity and cancer risk ( 34  –  36 ). 

 A  second  possible  explanation  for  these  discrepancies  is  that 
baseline  nutritional  status  of  the  populations  studied  inﬂ uenced 
the supplementation effects. The people of Linxian are nutrition-
ally deﬁ cient ( 3 , 37 ), so vitamin and mineral supplements may be 
more beneﬁ cial to them than to other populations that have been 
studied.  The  results  of  the  Dysplasia  NIT  ( 38 ),  a  medium-sized 
randomized nutrition intervention trial that was conducted among 
subjects with cytologically diagnosed esophageal squamous dyspla-
sia in Linxian at the same time as the General Population NIT, 
showed that supplementation with 26 minerals and vitamins was 
associated with a non – statistically signiﬁ cant 7% reduction in mor-
tality risk. Results from the Nutritional Prevention of Cancer Trial 
showed  that  the  beneﬁ ts  for  selenium  supplementation  on  total 
cancer mortality ( 39 ) and the development of prostate cancer ( 36 ) 
were essentially limited to participants with lower selenium levels 
at the start of the trial. Further support for this hypothesis comes 
from the data of the meta-analysis of antioxidant supplement trials 
and total mortality itself ( 33 ). We classiﬁ ed the 68 study popula-
tions included in this analysis as Western (n    =    58), East Asian (n    =    8), 
or other (n    =    2) and found statistically signiﬁ cant heterogeneity 
between the results of the studies performed in Western and East 
Asian populations. The Western studies had a combined odds ratio 
(OR) of 1.04 (95% CI    =   1.01 to 1.06) and the East Asian studies 
had a combined OR of 0.92 (95% CI    =    0.84 to 1.02) ( ␹  2  for het-
erogeneity   P      =   .02).  Because  nearly  all  of  the  events  in  the  East 
Asian group came from Linxian, which we know has borderline or 
deﬁ cient nutrition, this difference in meta-analysis results may well 
reﬂ ect differences in the baseline nutritional status of the popula-
tions evaluated. 

 A  third  possible  explanation  for  the  heterogeneity  of  results 
observed among studies that have evaluated the association of vita-
min supplements and total mortality or gastrointestinal cancer risk 
is effect modiﬁ cation by the stage of disease at study entry. Our 
results show that only individuals younger than 55 years beneﬁ ted 
from factor D. This result may indicate greater beneﬁ t earlier in 
the course of carcinogenesis and is consistent with a “point of no 
return,” beyond which supplementation with vitamins is not useful 
and  may  be  harmful,  preferentially  beneﬁ ting  the  developing 
tumor more than the host. This hypothesis may help explain why 
observational  studies,  which  reﬂ ect  long-term  intake  of  vitamins 
and vitamin-containing fruits and vegetables, have usually shown 
beneﬁ cial  associations,  whereas  trials,  which  have  largely  been 
conducted in older patients, have sometimes shown harmful effects 
from vitamin interventions. 

 Participants in the ATBC and CARET studies, in addition to 
being older than those in the Linxian general population trial (ages 
50 – 69 years for ATBC and 45 – 74 years for CARET), were heavy 
smokers and some were exposed to asbestos, both powerful carci-
nogenic exposures that may have put them beyond the point in the 
disease process that they could beneﬁ t from supplements. Detailed 
analyses of both of these studies have shown that the increased risk 
associated with vitamin use was almost exclusively seen in current 
(as  opposed  to  former)  smokers  ( 40 )  and  in  those  who  smoked 

most ( 41 ). In contrast, the PHS study, which included fewer than 
10% smokers, showed no adverse effect of beta-carotene ( 30 ). 

 In addition to this report, three other cancer prevention nutri-
tion  intervention  trials  have  reported  results  from  continued 
follow-up after the termination of intervention. Follow-up of the 
participants of the ATBC Study for up to 8 years after the end of 
the  intervention  showed  that  both  the  harmful  effects  of  beta-
carotene (ie, increased total mortality and lung cancer incidence) 
and the beneﬁ cial effect of vitamin E (ie, decreased prostate cancer 
incidence)  disappeared,  albeit  slowly  ( 42 ).  However,  analyses  of 
cerebral infarcts (80% of all strokes) among vitamin E recipients in 
the ATBC Study showed reversed effects during the trial (relative 
risk [RR]   =   0.86, 95% CI   =   0.75 to 0.99) ( 43 ) and the 6 years post-
trial  (RR    =    1.13,  95%  CI    =    1.00  to  1.27)  ( 44 ).  After  6  years  of 
postintervention follow-up in the CARET study, the relative risk 
of total mortality remained greater than 1.0, but this elevated risk 
diminished  and  was  no  longer  statistically  signiﬁ cant  ( 45 ).  Lung 
cancer  mortality,  however,  was  still  statistically  signiﬁ cantly 
increased. The Calcium Polyp Prevention Trial reported that the 
protective  effect  of  calcium  supplementation  on  colorectal  ade-
noma recurrence found during the trial period (RR   =   0.81, 95% 
CI   =   0.74 to 0.98) ( 46 ) continued up to 5 years after supplementa-
tion  ended  and  was,  if  anything,  stronger  after  than  during  the 
intervention itself (RR   =   0.63, 95% CI   =   0.46 to 0.87) ( 47 ). 

 Durability of cancer prevention effects after cessation of inter-
vention has also been observed with nonnutritional agents. In fact, 
the most consistent example of a sustained cancer prevention effect 
reported to date from any cancer prevention agent tested in trials 
is  for  tamoxifen  in  the  primary  prevention  of  breast  cancer. 
Posttrial  follow-up  from  three  tamoxifen  trials  ( 48  –  50 )  consis-
tently found beneﬁ t after the conclusion of active treatment, and 
in one trial ( 50 ), statistically signiﬁ cant reduction in risk (among 
patients  with  estrogen  receptor-positive  tumors)  was  seen  only 
after treatment had ceased. 

 This study has several strengths. It was a randomized double-
blind design and had excellent compliance and long-term follow-up 
with  virtually  complete  ascertainment  of  cases  in  a  well-deﬁ ned 
population. 

 This study also has limitations. Interventions with factors con-
taining  multiple  agents  do  not  allow  evaluation  of  the  effects  of 
individual agents alone, nor were we able to evaluate more than 
one  dose  for  each  of  the  agents  supplemented.  The  people  of 
Linxian are deﬁ cient in many micronutrients, which may limit the 
generalizability of these results to well-nourished populations. If 
the protective effects of this study are due to replacement of essen-
tial nutrients in a nutritionally deprived population, then similar 
interventions might be useful in similarly deprived populations in 
the West, including the United States, although populations with 
low rates of esophageal and gastric cancer mortality are unlikely to 
avert  as  many  deaths  as  high-rate  populations  such  as  that  in 
Linxian.  Finally,  the  smoothed  hazard  ratios  that  we  presented 
were intended to provide an alternative visual representation of the 
effects at speciﬁ c points in time and to complement the cumulative 
view offered by the Kaplan – Meier curves. These smoothed hazard 
ratios  should  be  interpreted  with  caution,  however,  because  the 
conﬁ dence intervals around these curves nearly always include 1.0. 
Thus, such curves are affected by the play of chance and may be

biased by choice of smoothing parameters, edge effects, and other 
factors. 

 It should be noted that the follow-up period occurred during a 
time of dramatic economic progress in China as a whole. Although 
documented  improvements  in  dietary  intakes  in  Linxian  during 
follow-up  were  modest  ( 37 ),  more  substantial  undocumented 
changes  almost  certainly  occurred.  Effects  of  dietary  improve-
ments should have been evenly distributed across all participants in 
the various randomized treatment groups in the trial. Thus, if the 
effects of the supplements and the dietary micronutrient intake are 
additive, any dietary changes that might have occurred should not 
bias the treatment group effects in the postintervention period. If 
instead  the  beneﬁ t  from  supplementation  was  to  correct  a  deﬁ -
ciency state to exceed some minimum required threshold, then, if 
all  people  started  to  become  less  deﬁ cient  because  of  dietary 
improvements over time, the observed treatment effects would be 
expected to weaken. It is all the more remarkable then that beneﬁ ts 
persisted  despite  this  likely  improved  nutrition  and  its  attendant 
attenuation of treatment effects. It is also possible that improved 
diet  may  have  modiﬁ ed  effects  in  the  postintervention  period, 
including the enhanced beneﬁ t widely observed in younger partici-
pants and the emergence of late effects, most notably the beneﬁ t 
for factor C on cerebrovascular deaths. 

 In summary, 10 years of postintervention follow-up of partici-
pants in this cancer prevention trial demonstrated the durability of 
previously  observed  beneﬁ cial  effects  on  mortality  from  supple-
mentation with selenium, vitamin E, and beta-carotene. The per-
sistence of risk reduction for up to 10 years after treatment in this 
trial reinforces the validity of the original trial ﬁ ndings and is con-
sistent  with  an  emerging  new  paradigm  in  cancer  prevention, 
namely,  that  prevention  may  be  achievable  with  short-term  as 
opposed  to  life-long  treatment.  Striking  age  interactions  were 
seen,  suggesting  that  supplements  may  be  more  beneﬁ cial  in 
younger age groups. Late beneﬁ cial and harmful effects on mortal-
ity not observed during the trial period of supplementation were 
also  seen  for  other  supplementation  groups.  Durability  and  late 
effects should be examined in other prevention trials.
