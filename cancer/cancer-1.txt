It has been estimated by various authorities that about one-third of cancers in Western
high-income societies are attributable to factors relating to food, nutrition and physical activity.
Identifying with conﬁdence speciﬁc associations between dietary patterns,
foods, body
composition or individual nutrients is not simple because of the long latent period for cancer
development,
its complex pathogenesis and the challenge of characterising the multi-
dimensional aspects of diet and activity over a lifetime. Reliable conclusions must therefore
be drawn not only from randomised controlled trials but from a variety of methodological
approaches,
judged within a classic framework for inferring causality. Using a newly-
developed method with a protocol for standardising the literature search and for analysis and
display of the evidence, nine independent academic centres have conducted systematic reviews
addressing the causal associations between food, nutrition and physical activity and risk of
development of seventeen cancers, as well as of weight gain and obesity. A review has also
examined the efﬁcacy of such interventions in subjects with cancer. The reviews have been
assessed by an independent Panel of twenty-one international experts who drew conclusions
with grades of conﬁdence in the causality of associations and made recommendations.
Recommendations are given as public health goals as well as for individuals.

Cancer prevention: Systematic literature reviews: Expert recommendations

In the UK cancer accounts for about one-quarter of all
deaths, second only to CVD(1). Although survival
is
increasing with improved management, many cancers still
carry a poor prognosis as they are less susceptible to sur-
gical, radiotherapeutic or chemotherapeutic intervention,
either because of their inherent characteristics or because
they may be detected at a late stage of development.

The most common cancers are diseases of adulthood,
becoming especially more common in older age. As the
population ages cancer prevalence is therefore predicted to
increase. Consequently, a policy of managing the burden of
cancer in the population based entirely on screening for
early detection and management of detected cancers is
unlikely to make a marked impact at a population level

except for a few types of cancer, and is also likely to be
increasingly, and unsustainably, expensive.

Thus, it is important to consider the role for primary
prevention in helping to reduce the clinical, personal,
economic and social burden of cancer. Approximately one-
third of all cancers in high-income countries such as the
UK are attributed to smoking(2). Authoritative reviews
have further estimated that about one-third of all cancers
in such countries might be attributable to factors relating
to food, nutrition and physical activity, including body
fatness.

In 1997 the World Cancer Research Fund (WCRF),
together with its sister organisation the American Institute
for Cancer Research, published a landmark report Food,

Nutrition and the Prevention of Cancer: a Global
Perspective(3). This report has become the most author-
itative statement on the topic and a basis for academics,
researchers and policy-makers worldwide, and has been
followed by a surge in research on the nutritional links
with cancer.

In view of the burgeoning body of evidence, in 2001
WCRF and American Institute for Cancer Research
embarked on a new report to ensure that its recommend-
ations remained a sound basis for its own and others’
activities. This report was published in November 2007(4).

Nutrition and the cancer process

Cancer develops from a clone of cells that have escaped
normal regulation of growth, proliferation, differentiation
and intercellular
relationships. These abnormalities of
function derive from disordered expression of key genes,
resulting in altered cellular phenotype. The disordered
gene expression may result from genetic mutation or from
epigenetic factors that may silence genes that should be
active or switch on genes that should be silent. Factors
relating to food and nutrition may directly inﬂuence both
processes.

Food components may act directly as mutagens, or
conversely may interfere with the action of external
mutagens either directly or by facilitating their elimination.
Nutritional factors may also alter the cellular milieu by
modulating hormonal axes, and so inﬂuencing growth and
proliferation amongst speciﬁc cell populations. Finally,
regulation of processes related to speciﬁc nutrients may
directly inﬂuence the expression of key genes, for instance
through abnormalities of methylation of
the promoter
regions of genes or of histone acetylation, which can
inﬂuence DNA structure and accessibility of genes to
mRNA for transcription.

interaction between genotype

While it is clear that at root cancer is a disease of gene
expression, only a minority of cancers appear to be related
to inherited single high-penetrance gene mutations. Con-
sequently, a major determinant of cancer risk appears to be
the
and environment.
Amongst the earliest identiﬁed indicators of the importance
of this interaction are the different patterns of cancer
around the world. Low-income countries have relatively
high rates of cancers of the cervix, stomach, liver and
oro-pharynx (all of which are at least partly related to
infections), while high-income countries are characterised
by higher rates of cancers of the breast, prostate and colo-
rectum (related to alterations in hormonal axes)(4). Most
striking is the rapid change in cancer patterns, within one
or two generations, when populations migrate. Together
with the secular changes in the incidence of some cancers
over only decades, this rapid change effectively excludes
inherited factors as a key determinant of these patterns at a
population level, although clearly they may be important in
determining individual risk within populations.

The rationale for considering food, nutrition and physi-
cal activity as key environmental factors in determining
cancer risk derives from a mass of epidemiological and
mechanistic data, and more recently with some clinical
trials as well. The second WCRF/American Institute for

Cancer Research report was commissioned with an expert
Panel to review this evidence, to draw conclusions and to
make recommendations.

The process for the report

Cancer is the result of a complex process of accumulation
of abnormal phenotypic characteristics among a clone of
cells, usually over decades. This complexity and timescale
present obstacles to the study of its pathogenesis and
natural history, especially during the preclinical stages.
Equally, it is challenging to characterise subjects’ exposure
to food and nutrients, and their trajectory of growth and
body composition, over the life course. In these circum-
stances, clinical
trials cannot realistically address more
than a short period of the whole pathogenetic process and
are usually conducted in high-risk groups who may not be
representative of the general population. Often dietary
intervention is in the form of isolated supplements rather
than real foods, as it is difﬁcult to achieve or maintain
differences between intervention and control groups for
real dietary or physical activity interventions.

Consequently, it is difﬁcult to identify single methodo-
logical approaches that can be seen as inherently superior.
With a body of evidence comprising very different
approaches,
from observational epidemiology to basic
science, and where the generalisability of clinical trials is
limited, robust conclusions can only be drawn from a
review of the totality of the relevant evidence, allowing for
the advantages and disadvantages of different methods.
There are accepted approaches to synthesising such evi-
dence and inferring the likely causality of observed associ-
ations, such as that proposed in 1963 by Bradford Hill(5).
With a view to exploring the literature so that Bradford
Hill’s framework could be applied, WCRF International
convened an expert Task Force to develop a standardised
method for searching the literature and for analysing and
displaying the evidence. This methodology Task Force met
over 2 years to develop such a speciﬁcation.

The feasibility, utility and reproducibility of the speciﬁ-
cation manual was tested and compared between two
independent academic institutes, using endometrial cancer
as a test case. As a result amendments were made to the
protocol, and the ﬁnal version(6) was used to conduct the
series of systematic literature reviews (SLR) that formed
the basis of the Panel’s deliberations.

It was decided to keep the process of data collection,
analysis and display separate from that of judging it. Thus,
nine independent SLR centres, three in the USA, four in
the UK and two in continental Europe, were commissioned
to conduct SLR on the links between food, nutrition and
physical activity and seventeen cancer sites. In addition,
SLR were conducted on the links with weight gain and
body fatness and the efﬁcacy of nutrition and activity
interventions in individuals who had already received
a diagnosis of cancer. Finally, a review was conducted
on authoritative national and international reports that
had made recommendations for the prevention of other
diseases, so that any recommendations from this report
would be set in a broad public health context.

Nutrition support in cancer therapy

Each SLR team had to include a range of expertise,
in nutrition, epidemiology, statistics, cancer biology, the
speciﬁc cancer site and systematic review. Each SLR was
peer reviewed at the protocol and draft ﬁnal report stage.
WCRF International provided a coordinator whose role
was to facilitate the process and ensure consistency in
application of the speciﬁcation.

An expert Panel was convened, comprising twenty-one
internationally-renowned scientists, with a range of exper-
tise including nutrition, epidemiology, cancer mechanisms,
clinical medicine and public health. Chaired by Professor
Sir Michael Marmot, the Panel met over 5 years to discuss
and judge the evidence from the SLR, to draw conclusions
and to make recommendations.

Judging the evidence

Given the complex nature both of the disease process of
cancer and of the characterisation of diet and physical
activity over a lifetime, a simple hierarchical approach
to evidence on causal links cannot rely on randomised
controlled trials. Apart from the obvious inability to mask
differences in dietary interventions based on real foods, in
practical terms it is equally impossible to secure sufﬁ-
ciently large or sustained differences in lifestyle including
diet between intervention groups. Where such studies are
done they often use synthetic supplements of isolated
nutrients, at high dose, in high-risk groups, with inter-
mediate outcomes. Extrapolation from such studies to
the general population is not
therefore straightforward.
However, long-term observational studies of cohorts of
healthy individuals can identify hard outcomes (cancer
incidence or mortality) in typical populations consuming
real diets over decades. Observational studies, however,
unlike randomised trials, are subject
to confounding,
making causal inferences less robust.

The issue of identifying important causal associations
from predominantly observational data where trials are
uninformative is not new. Bradford Hill
in the 1960s
elucidated a series of characteristics of the data that could
provide a framework for consideration to help infer which
associations are likely to be causal(7). The SLR speciﬁc-
ation required the data to be displayed in a way that
facilitated the application of Bradford Hill’s criteria. The
evidence displayed was then judged within that framework,
and the likelihood of any association being causal was
graded according to how well the criteria were fulﬁlled.

Before any evidence was presented, the Panel agreed a
set of minimum criteria for each grade. The grades were:
convincing; probable; limited; substantial effect on risk
unlikely. The limited category was further divided into
where it was suggestive of a causal relation and where no
conclusion could be drawn. In addition, to provide ﬂexi-
bility, certain characteristics of the evidence could be used
to upgrade or downgrade conclusions.

Once conclusions were reached, they were presented
graphically in the form of a matrix. Matrices were pre-
sented for each cancer, with all
identiﬁed exposures
categorised according to the grade of conclusion as to the
likely causality of the association. In addition, matrices
were presented for each main group of exposures, with

to their likely causality (although excluding the large
category of limited–no conclusion).

Once agreed, these conclusions provided the basis for
making recommendations. Recommendations were based
only on conclusions for which the likely causality was
judged probable or convincing.

Making recommendations

Recommendations were developed by the Panel with the
aim of being as far as possible applicable throughout the
world. Where evidence was speciﬁc to particular local
circumstances this fact was stated. In addition, all recom-
mendations were considered within the context of the
review of authoritative expert reports on other diseases, to
ensure that they were conducive generally to public health
and not restricted to cancer prevention.

The Panel made ten recommendations. Each recom-
mendation has a title to identify the broad category of
food, nutrition or physical activity addressed. This title is
followed by a brief headline to provide a sense of the
essence of the recommendation, but without detail or
quantiﬁcation. Each recommendation then has a public
health goal or goals, directed to policy-makers or health
professionals with the aim of facilitating policies or pro-
grammes and quantiﬁed to aid target setting and monitor-
ing of progress. This public health goal is followed by
personal recommendations as a basis for the population (as
communities, families or individuals) to make decisions
about their own diet and lifestyle, also quantiﬁed where
possible.

Each of these recommendations is accompanied by
explanatory footnotes, which should be considered an
integral part of the recommendation.

The headline recommendations are shown in Table 1.

Looking to the future

The conclusions and recommendations of the Panel set out
in the report form a robust basis for further research and
for public and professional education programmes. WCRF
is preparing materials and other resources that begin this
process.

However, scientiﬁc evidence is continually accumulat-
ing, and each new study needs to be considered in the
context of the existing evidence. Thus, WCRF has com-
missioned a group from Imperial College, London, UK to
combine the existing databases produced by the cancer-site
SLR, and to update them as new information accrues. This
process is overseen by a panel of independent experts, and
will be accompanied by periodic reports of updated con-
clusions and of the implications for the recommendations.
Furthermore, while food, nutrition and physical activity
are proximate causes of patterns of cancer, and of other
chronic diseases,
is clear that patterns of food con-
sumption and of activity are themselves determined by
powerful social, cultural, political and economic factors.
A further report to be published in November 2008 will
address the evidence for determinants of such patterns
and for what might be effective in inﬂuencing them. This
report, Policy and Action for Cancer Prevention: Food,
Nutrition, and Physical Activity – a Global Perspective,
will explore the evidence in a similarly rigorous way and
make further recommendations for policies and actions to
politicians, policy-makers, health professionals and others.
