Abstract

Background: Dietary energy density (ED) is a measure of diet quality that estimates the amount of energy per unit of food

(kilocalories per gram) consumed. Low-ED diets are generally high in ﬁber and fruits and vegetables and low in fat. Dietary

ED has been positively associated with body mass index (BMI) and other risk factors for postmenopausal breast cancer.

Objective: We evaluated the associations of total dietary ED and energy-dense (high-ED) foods with postmenopausal

breast cancer incidence.

Methods: Analyses included 56,795 postmenopausal women from the Cancer Prevention Study II Nutrition Cohort with

no previous history of breast or other cancers and who provided information on diet, lifestyle, and medical history in 1999.

Multivariable-adjusted breast cancer incidence rate ratios (RRs and 95% CIs) were estimated for quintiles of total dietary

ED and for the consumption of high-ED foods in Cox proportional hazards regression models.

Results: During a median follow-up of 11.7 y, 2509 invasive breast cancer cases were identiﬁed, including 1857 estrogen

receptor-positive and 277 estrogen receptor-negative tumors. Median dietary ED was 1.5 kcal/g (IQR: 1.3–1.7 kcal/g). After

adjusting for age, race, education, reproductive characteristics, and family history, high compared with low dietary ED was

associated with a statistically signiﬁcantly higher risk of breast cancer (RR for ﬁfth quintile compared with ﬁrst quintile: 1.20;
95% CI: 1.05, 1.36; P-trend = 0.03). The association between the amount of high-ED foods consumed and breast cancer risk

was not statistically signiﬁcant. We observed no differences by estrogen receptor status or effect modiﬁcation by BMI, age,

or physical activity.

Conclusion: These results suggest a modest positive association between total dietary ED and risk of postmenopausal
breast cancer. J Nutr 2016;146:2045–50.

Introduction

Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer among
American women. By the end of 2016, there will be ;245,000
incident invasive cases diagnosed, and ;40,000 women will die
from breast cancer (1). Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease.
For example, differences in risk factors, clinical characteristics,
responses to treatments, and prognoses have been observed among
subtypes determined by the estrogen receptor (ER)5 (2–4). Among
prospective cohort studies, tumors that express the ER (;70–80%

ER+) have been more strongly associated with hormone-related
inﬂuences than ER2 tumors (;20–30% ER2) (4–6).

Established risk factors for postmenopausal breast cancer
include reproductive characteristics, hormonal therapies con-
taining estrogen and progestin, alcohol consumption, and
factors related to energy balance, including physical activity,
obesity, and adult weight gain (7). For dietary components, such
as dietary ﬁber and total fat, the World Cancer Research Fund
(WCRF)/American Institute for Cancer Research (AICR) (8, 9)
concluded that there was no convincing evidence for associa-
tions with breast cancer incidence and mortality. Nevertheless,
diet continues to be an active area of research, with more studies
focusing on overall dietary patterns and considering whether
risks may differ by other attributes (e.g., ER status or other
tumor characteristics) (10–16).

Dietary energy density (ED) is a relatively new measure of
diet quality that estimates the amount of energy per unit of food

(kilocalories per gram) consumed. ED can be calculated for
individual foods, meals, and total diet (17). A low-ED diet
pattern is generally high in fruits and vegetables and ﬁber and
low in fat (large weight with less energy contribution) (17). We
recently reported that dietary ED was positively associated with
measures of body fat and established obesity-related markers for
cancer in a cross-sectional, nationally representative sample of
US adults (18). These ﬁndings support WCRF/AICRÕs judgment
that consuming high-ED food increases, whereas low-ED
decreases, the risk of weight gain, overweight, and obesity and
thereby might be associated with cancer risk (8). On average,
individuals consume a similar weight of food daily; thus,
replacing high-ED foods with low-ED foods should encourage
weight control and could ultimately reduce the risk of weight-
related cancers later in life (19–21). Other aspects of a high-ED
diet pattern may also inﬂuence cancer risk. For example, ED was
positively associated with measures of breast density among
young women independent of weight status (22). This may be
very important because women with a high breast density have a
4–6-fold increase in breast cancer risk (23).

No prospective study, to our knowledge, has evaluated the
association between consuming energy-dense foods and breast
cancer risk. Moreover, no study, to our knowledge, has evaluated
the association between total dietary ED, perhaps a better indicator
of overall diet quality than the frequency of consuming energy-dense
foods, and breast cancer. Our primary objective was to examine
associations of total dietary ED and high-ED foods with invasive
breast cancer incidence. Because BMI is positively associated with
postmenopausal cancer risk and could potentially be on the causal
pathway between a high-ED dietary pattern and risk, we also
explored whether BMI explains or modiﬁes a potential association
between ED and breast cancer risk. Last, we also assessed whether
associations differed by age, physical activity, and ER status.

Methods

Cohort description. Women in this study were drawn from the CPS-II
(Cancer Prevention Study II) Nutrition Cohort, a prospective study of
cancer incidence and mortality that was established by the American
Cancer Society in 1992 and includes ;98,000 women (24). The nutrition
cohort is a subset of the larger CPS-II mortality study initiated by the
American Cancer Society in 1982. Participants in the nutrition cohort
were recruited from 21 states and were aged 50–74 y at enrollment when
they completed a survey on demographic, medical, dietary, and lifestyle
characteristics. All living members have received follow-up question-
naires every 2 y since 1997 to update exposure information and to
ascertain newly diagnosed cancers. All aspects of the CPS-II Nutrition
Cohort have been reviewed and approved by the Emory University
Institutional Review Board.

Follow-up for this analysis began in 1999 when participants completed
and returned a comprehensive FFQ (24–26) and was calculated from the
date of receipt of this FFQ until the date of invasive breast cancer
diagnosis, death, or until June 30, 2011, whichever came ﬁrst. Of the
73,640 CPS-II Nutrition Cohort participants who completed the 1999
FFQ, 1744 were lost to follow-up, and exclusions were made for women
who reported a history of any cancer before 1999 (except nonmelanoma
skin cancer) (n = 13,624), with a menopausal status of perimenopausal,
premenopausal, or unknown (n = 189); unveriﬁed self-reported breast
cancers (n = 26); or an invalid diagnosis date (n = 6). We also excluded
women with implausible dietary data [very low (<600 kcal/d) or very high
(>3500 kcal/d) total energy intakes or missing complete sections of the
FFQ (n = 1256)], leaving a ﬁnal analytic sample of 56,795.

Breast cancer case ascertainment. Cases included invasive breast
cancer cases diagnosed between January 1999 and July 2011. Most
breast cancer diagnoses were identiﬁed through self-report on follow-up

2046 Hartman et al.

questionnaires and then veriﬁed via medical records or linkage with
state registries or computerized linkage with the National Death Index
(n = 2451) (97.7%); however, some were listed as a primary or
contributory cause of death on their death certiﬁcate and were identiﬁed
through linkage with the National Death Index only (n = 58) (2.3%)
(27). Tumor clinical characteristics, when available (e.g., ER status),
were obtained from state registries or abstracted from medical records
and were available for 2134 cases (85%).

Assessment of dietary intake. Diet was assessed in 1999 with the use
of a modiﬁed 152-item Willett FFQ. Participants were asked how often
on average (never to 6 servings/d) they consumed a speciﬁc portion of
foods and beverages over the previous year. The food energy (kilocalories),
weight (grams), and nutrient content of foods and beverages were de-
termined with the use of a nutrient database from Harvard University that
included composition values from the USDA and supplemented with other
sources. No standardized method exists, to our knowledge, for selecting
foods and beverages to include in the ED calculation; however, Johnson
et al. (28) recommended using foods only and controlling for beverage
energy when it is an important confounder. Most studies that have
observed associations between dietary ED and disease status have done so
with the use of food-only ED (28). We calculated total dietary ED from
foods only and computed ED for individual foods. We also created a
total quantity of high-ED foods consumed by summing the consumption
of individual foods with EDs $2.25 (>225 kcal/100 g) (e.g., desserts,
candy, buttered or regular microwave popcorn, chips, breakfast
quick breads, peanut butter, jam, mayonnaise and other salad dressings,
higher-fat meats, etc.) (29). Nuts, seeds, wheat germ, and olive oil met
the criteria for high-ED foods but were excluded because according to
WCRF/AICR guidelines relatively unprocessed energy-dense foods such
as these may provide valuable nutrients and have not been shown to
contribute to weight gain when consumed as part of typical diets (29).

Statistical analysis. Statistical analyses were performed with the use
of SAS version 9.2 (SAS Institute). We calculated Spearman correla-
tion coefﬁcients between continuous variables of total dietary ED and
the quantity of high-ED foods consumed and BMI (in kg/m2) and
selected dietary variables [e.g., total energy intake (kilocalories per day)].
Total dietary ED and high-ED food consumption were categorized
into quantiles (quintiles or quartiles) of intake based on the overall
distribution in the cohort, with the lowest quantile serving as the
referent. Multivariable-adjusted breast cancer incidence rate ratios (RRs
and 95% CIs) were estimated for categories of ED in Cox proportional
hazards regression models, with the lowest category as the referent. The
associations between breast cancer risk and total dietary ED and
quantity of high-ED foods consumed were evaluated in models that
adjusted for age, race/ethnicity, educational status, age at menarche, age at
ﬁrst birth and parity, age at menopause, family history of breast cancer, and
hormone replacement therapy use. Final models were evaluated with and
without BMI as a categorical variable. Several other potential covariates did
not appreciably contribute to model ﬁt or interpretation and thus were
not included in the ﬁnal models. These variables included adult weight
gain, waist circumference, smoking status, menstrual cycle regularity, oral
contraceptive use, physical activity, sitting time, total energy intake and
energy intake from beverages, alcohol consumption, history of benign
breast disease, and recent mammography. Tests of linear trends were
conducted in ﬁnal multivariable models by assigning the median value from
each quintile of ED and modeling this value as a continuous variable. The
Cox proportional hazards assumption was tested by modeling multiplica-
tive interaction terms between ED variables and time. We evaluated
interactions by BMI, age, and physical activity with ED by including each
individual factor and its cross-product term with the ED quintile in separate
multivariable models with the use of the likelihood ratio test. We also
evaluated whether the associations between total dietary ED or high-ED
foods (modeled as quartiles because of the small numbers of ER2 cases)
and postmenopausal breast cancer risk differed by ER status. For these
analyses, we used joint Cox proportional hazards models (30) and censored
women when they were diagnosed with breast cancer with the ER status
that was not the outcome of the particular analysis. Results from 2-sided
chi-square tests were considered statistically signiﬁcant at P < 0.05.

Results

During a median follow-up of 11.7 y, 2509 breast cancer cases
were identiﬁed; 2134 had information on ER status (85% cases).
Among tumors with a known receptor status, 1857 (87%) were
ER+ and 277 (13%) were ER2. Baseline participant character-
istics are presented by category of total dietary ED in Table 1.
Median dietary ED was 1.5 kcal/g (IQR: 1.3–1.7 kcal/g). Women
who consumed higher-ED diets were more likely to be heavier,
to have a larger waist circumference, and to have experienced
greater adult weight gain (i.e., from age 18 y to baseline) than
those who consumed lower-ED diets. They were also more likely
to be current smokers and less physically active. As expected,
women who consumed higher-ED diets tended to have diets that
were also higher in total energy and fat but lower in ﬁber.

Spearman correlation coefﬁcients between total dietary ED
with total energy (kilocalories), fat (percentage of energy), and
ﬁber (g/1000 kcal) were 0.15, 0.49, and 20.70, respectively (all
P < 0.05; data not presented). In contrast, Spearman correlation
coefﬁcients between the quantity of high-ED foods consumed
with total energy (kilocalories), fat (percentage of energy), and
ﬁber (g/1000 kcal) were 0.75, 0.32, and 20.32, respectively (all
P < 0.05; data not presented). The correlation between total dietary
ED with the quantity of high-ED foods was 0.49; neither measure
was highly correlated with BMI (0.10 for total dietary ED and
0.09 for the quantity of high-ED foods).

The association between total dietary ED consumption and
postmenopausal breast cancer risk is shown in Table 2. Without
adjusting for BMI, there was a statistically signiﬁcant positive
association between total ED and risk [RR for ﬁfth quintile

compared with ﬁrst quintile (Q5v.1): 1.20; 95% CI: 1.05, 1.36;
P-trend = 0.03]. Adjusting for BMI attenuated the associations,
although conﬁdence limits for the comparisons of the ﬁfth to the
ﬁrst quintiles did not cross 1.0 (RR for Q5v.1: 1.17; 95% CI:
1.03, 1.33; P-trend = 0.09). In models that adjusted for BMI
there were no statistically signiﬁcant interactions by age, phys-
ical activity, or BMI. As shown in Table 2, in stratiﬁed analyses
associations for total ED with breast cancer risk were not
statistically signiﬁcant for either ER+ or ER2 cases. Differences
between risk subtypes were also not statistically signiﬁcant.

The association between the quantity of high-ED foods
consumed and postmenopausal breast cancer risk is shown in
Table 3. Both with and without adjusting for BMI, the quantity of
high-ED foods consumed was not signiﬁcantly associated with a
higher risk of breast cancer (RR for Q5v.1: 1.06; 95% CI: 0.93,
1.21 and RR for Q5v.1: 1.09; 95% CI: 0.96, 1.24, respectively).
Adding total energy intake to the model also had little effect on

the results (data not shown). Associations for high-ED foods with
breast cancer risk were not statistically signiﬁcant for either ER+
or ER2 cases (data not shown) and did not differ by ER status.

Discussion

In this large prospective cohort, women who consumed high-ED
diets were at modestly higher risk for postmenopausal breast
cancer during >10 y of follow-up. Additional adjustment for BMI,
which may be on the causal pathway, slightly attenuated this
association. Overall, risk estimates were heightened beginning
with the second quintile and were fairly stable across the
remaining upper quintiles. There was no effect modiﬁcation by
BMI, age, or physical activity, and results did not differ by ER
status. In analyses to assess the risk of greater high-ED food
intake, risk estimates tended to be positive but not statistically
signiﬁcant.

The epidemiologic evidence for a relation between a diet high
in ED and breast cancer risk is limited (31), and no previous
study to our knowledge has speciﬁcally examined total dietary
ED. Chandran et al. (31) evaluated the association between
consuming energy-dense foods and breast cancer in a population-
based case-control study, stratifying by race, age, and ER status.
In European American postmenopausal women only (n = 366
cases and 316 controls), a statistically signiﬁcant increased breast
cancer risk (OR for fourth quartile compared with ﬁrst quartile:
2.95; 95% CI: 1.66, 5.22; P-trend = 0.001) was observed with
frequent consumption (>11 compared with #3 servings/wk) of
energy-dense foods after adjusting for confounders, including
BMI. The results were more pronounced among women with
ER+ than ER2 cancers. In comparison, we found limited evidence
for an association between ED foods and risk. Adjusting for total
energy intake in the study by Chandran et al. (31) strengthened
their results for high-ED foods, whereas adjusting for total energy
intake had a minimal impact on the risk estimates in our study.
Differences in results between our study and that of Chandran
et al. may partly be because of the study design; CPS-II is a
prospective study with diet measured before diagnosis, whereas in
the Chandran et al. case-control study diet was recalled after case
diagnoses. In addition, our analyses included additional high-ED
foods (e.g., mayonnaise, butter or margarine).

Dietary ED may play a role in breast cancer risk through a
complex interplay of correlated and modiﬁable dietary factors,
including total energy intake, diet composition, and nutrient
intakes (32). High-ED diet consumption contributes to increased
energy intake and is associated with obesity (18, 33). Insulin
insensitivity, chronic inﬂammation, oxidative stress, and unfa-
vorable effects on growth factor and sex hormone concentra-
tions are metabolic consequences that accompany obesity and
are associated with carcinogenesis (34–37). In our study, we
observed that high-ED diets were higher in total energy and total
and saturated fat but lower in ﬁber. A controlled weight-
maintenance feeding study of 48 women tested the effects of diet
composition on a series of sex hormone concentrations (38). In
comparison with a high-fat (40% energy), low-ﬁber (12 g/d)
diet,
lower-fat (20–25% energy), higher-ﬁber (40 g/d) diets
signiﬁcantly decreased (29% to 215%) serum concentrations
of sex hormones linked to breast cancer risk (38). Over a womanÕs
lifetime response to a high-ED diet could inﬂuence breast cancer
risk through the generation of mutagenic metabolites and tissue
growth stimulation (39). Last, dietary patterns characterized by
higher intakes of reﬁned starches, added sugar, and saturated
fats and lower consumption of fruits, vegetables, and ﬁber lead
to lower intakes of antioxidants (e.g., carotenoids) and other
potentially anticarcinogenic phytochemicals (8). Several studies
have reported inverse associations for plant-based dietary pat-
terns (likely low-ED), deﬁned either with the use of data-driven
approaches or a priori indexes, with the risk of ER2 breast cancers,
but associations with overall breast cancer have been inconsis-
tent (10–16). Nevertheless, diets lacking these constituents may
increase DNA damage susceptibility, unchecked cellular prolif-
eration, and systemic inﬂammation (40–42).

This large prospective study has several strengths. It included
a long follow-up time, and many covariates were available for
the analysis. Dietary data were collected before diagnosis with
the use of a well-characterized instrument designed to assess
usual dietary intake and validated with a series of four 1-wk
dietary records collected in a demographically similar group of
women. Pearson correlation coefﬁcients for comparing energy-
adjusted total fat and ﬁber (dietary ED was not assessed)
between the FFQ and means of food records were 0.53 and 0.58,

respectively (25, 43). Nevertheless, there are measurement errors
associated with all dietary assessment methods, and there were
likely measurement errors in the calculation of ED in our study.
For example, behavior changes contributing to modest but
persistent decreases in dietary ED, such as selecting lower-fat
versions of foods or adding vegetables to higher-ED foods (e.g.,
pizza, sandwiches, other mixed dishes) are challenging to capture
with FFQs. We used a single questionnaire to characterize dietary
intake to maximize our sample size; however, a subset of the
population that also had dietary data collected in 2003 demon-
strated stability in dietary ED estimates over time. For example,
;80% of respondents in the highest category of ED (i.e., ﬁfth
quintile) in 1999 reported dietary intakes that placed them in
either the fourth or ﬁfth quintile in 2003. Residual confounding
by BMI or other factors cannot be ruled out. Finally, the CPS-II
Nutrition Cohort includes mostly older, white, middle-class
women, which has implications for the generalizability of our
observations to younger and more diverse populations of women.
In summary, our results provide evidence of a modest positive
association between dietary ED and postmenopausal breast
cancer risk. To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst analysis to examine
the association between overall dietary energy density and breast
cancer risk. The quality of a wide variety of dietary patterns can
be increased through simultaneously reducing saturated fat and
increasing ﬁber and vegetable and fruit intakes. Our data support
the value of dietary patterns that incorporate fruits and vegetables
and other low-ED foods that may facilitate weight management
and reduce the risk of postmenopausal breast cancer.
