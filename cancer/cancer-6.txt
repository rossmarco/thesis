Background.

Abstract
Lung  cancer  and  cardiovas-
cular  disease  are  major  causes  of  death  in  the  United
States.  It  has  been  proposed  that  carotenoids  and  reti-
noids are agents that may prevent these disorders.

Methods.

We  conducted  a  multicenter,  randomized,
double-blind, placebo-controlled primary prevention trial
— the Beta-Carotene and Retinol Efﬁcacy Trial — involv-
ing a total of 18,314 smokers, former smokers, and work-
ers exposed to asbestos. The effects of a combination of
30 mg of beta carotene per day and 25,000 IU of retinol
(vitamin A) in the form of retinyl palmitate per day on the
primary  end  point,  the  incidence  of  lung  cancer,  were
compared with those of placebo.

Results.

A  total  of  388  new  cases  of  lung  cancer
were diagnosed during the 73,135 person-years of follow-
up (mean length of follow-up, 4.0 years). The active-treat-
ment group had a relative risk of lung cancer of 1.28 (95
percent  conﬁdence  interval,  1.04  to  1.57;  P
0.02),  as

UNG cancer is the leading cause of death from can-
cer  in  the  United  States,  accounting  for  approxi-
mately 29 percent of deaths from cancer and 6 percent
of all deaths.
New approaches are essential to prevent
1 
lung cancer in persons who have smoked cigarettes or
who have had occupational exposure to asbestos. Twen-
ty-nine percent of men and 25 percent of women who
 and at least
are 45 to 64 years of age currently smoke,
40 percent of men and 20 percent of women in this age
group are former smokers.
 An estimated 4000 to 6000
3
deaths from lung cancer per year are attributed to ex-
posure to asbestos.

On the basis of epidemiologic observations and lab-
oratory  studies,  beta  carotene  and  vitamin  A  have  at-
tracted  wide  interest  as  agents  that  may  prevent  lung
cancer.
 The Beta-Carotene and Retinol Efﬁcacy Trial
(CARET)  is  one  of  several  recent  trials  to  assess  the

compared with the placebo group. There were no statis-
tically signiﬁcant differences in the risks of other types of
cancer. In the active-treatment group, the relative risk of
death  from  any  cause  was  1.17  (95  percent  conﬁdence
interval, 1.03 to 1.33); of death from lung cancer, 1.46 (95
percent  conﬁdence  interval,  1.07  to  2.00);  and  of  death
from cardiovascular disease, 1.26 (95 percent conﬁdence
interval, 0.99 to 1.61). On the basis of these ﬁndings, the
randomized  trial  was  stopped  21  months  earlier  than
planned; follow-up will continue for another 5 years.

Conclusions.

After  an  average  of  four  years  of  sup-
plementation, the combination of beta carotene and vita-
min A had no beneﬁt and may have had an adverse effect
on the incidence of lung cancer and on the risk of death
from lung cancer, cardiovascular disease, and any cause
in smokers and workers exposed to asbestos. (N  Engl J

Study Design

9,14-16

The  study’s  strategy,  design,  detailed  methods,  eligibility,  pilot-
study ﬁndings, and recruitment information have been published else-
where.
  Brieﬂy,  CARET  was  organized  in  1983  and  began  ran-
domization in Seattle in 1985 in two pilot studies: one enrolled 816
men  with  substantial  occupational  exposure  to  asbestos,  who  were
randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either a combination of
15 mg of beta carotene per day and 25,000 IU of retinol per day (ac-
tive treatment) or placebo; the second enrolled 1029 men and women
with extensive histories of cigarette smoking, to receive 30 mg of beta
carotene per day, 25,000 IU of retinol per day, both vitamins, or nei-
ther vitamin (two-by-two design). The trial was expanded to include
additional study centers in 1988 and 1991, and all subjects were ran-
domly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either active treatment or placebo.
The  pilot  groups  receiving  active  agents  were  consolidated  in  1988
into a single group receiving a standard daily regimen of 30 mg of
beta carotene plus 25,000 IU of retinol in the form of retinyl palmi-
tate. Thus, in the pilot study with the cohort of smokers, three sub-
jects were assigned to active treatment for every subject assigned to
placebo; therefore, the rates rather than numbers of end points must
 called
be compared between active and placebo groups. The design

for active intervention until late 1997 (110,000 person-years), with re-
porting of results in 1998.

cruitment. To be eligible for the study the subjects had to have ﬁrst
been exposed to asbestos on the job 15 years before randomization,
and either have had a chest x-ray ﬁlm positive for asbestos-related
lung  disease  or  have  worked  in  speciﬁed  high-risk  trades  —  as
plumbers and pipe ﬁtters, steamﬁtters, shipyard boilermakers, non-
shipyard boilermakers, shipyard electricians, ship scalers, insulators,
plasterboard workers, or sheet-metal workers — for 5 years. The as-
; subse-
bestos pilot study had no requirements regarding smoking
quently,  subjects  were  required  to  be  current  smokers  or  to  have
smoked within the previous 15 years. For the population of smokers,
women  and  men  were  recruited  from  health  insurance  rolls  and
managed-care organizations if they were 50 to 69 years of age, had
at least 20 pack-years of cigarette smoking, and either were currently
smoking or had quit smoking within the previous six years. The par-
ticipants agreed to limit their supplemental intake of vitamin A to
less than 5500 IU per day and to take no supplemental beta caro-
tene. A total of 4060 workers exposed to asbestos and 14,254 heavy
smokers (44 percent of whom were women) were randomized. We
provided detailed information for informed consent at recruitment
and  regularly  thereafter,  including  a  letter  to  each  participant  de-
scribing  the  results  of  the  1994  Alpha-Tocopherol,  Beta  Carotene
Cancer Prevention Study (ATBC).

Active  agents  and  placebos  were  purchased  from  Hoffmann–
LaRoche and formulated by Tishcon Corporation. Both formulations
were given as capsules. Beta carotene beadlets were combined with
retinyl palmitate in a single capsule and dispensed in bottles, which
were weighed and their contents checked. We assessed the subjects’
compliance by weighing the returned bottles to estimate the number
of capsules remaining (in 85 percent of the assessments) or by relying
on the subjects’ own estimates (15 percent). Blood was collected an-
nually from the original pilot participants and every two years from
the other participants.

Subjects who stopped receiving study vitamins for any reason other
than  death  were  deﬁned  as  inactive  participants  and  were  still  fol-
lowed for end points and counted in the analyses.

Data Collection and Monitoring of Safety

and End Points
Each year active participants visited a study center once and were
telephoned  twice,  at  four-month  intervals.  Inactive  participants
were telephoned semiannually. Over 97 percent of scheduled contacts
were completed. As of December 15, 1995, ascertainment of vital sta-
tus was more than 98 percent complete.

Symptoms and signs and newly diagnosed medical conditions were
monitored  closely  by  questionnaire  at  all  contacts  and  in  limited
physical  examinations  during  study-center  visits;  laboratory  values
for  liver  function  and  serum  analytes  were  monitored  annually  in
participants  randomized  in  the  pilot  studies  (for  use  in  adjusting
estimates of relative risk with the case–cohort approach).
 The 13
17
monitored symptoms were graded according to the CARET symp-
tom-assessment scale.
 An independent safety and end-points mon-
16
itoring  committee  met  semiannually  to  review  in  blinded  fashion
data  coded  according to intervention group. When the results of the
ATBC Cancer Prevention trial
 became available, the committee re-
viewed the results of the ﬁrst interim analysis and requested that the
blinding  be  ended.  Subsequently,  the  committee  reviewed  data  un-
blinded.

10

Ascertainment and Evaluation of End Points

All  initial  reports  of  cancers  and  deaths  from  each  study  center
were submitted to the coordinating center and entered into a tracking
system. Participants and all study staff members involved in the as-
certainment and evaluation of end points and assignment of ﬁnal di-
agnoses remained unaware of the participants’ treatment assignment
throughout the trial. Clinical records and, for tumors involving the
lung, pathology specimens were obtained for independent review by
the end-points review committee, composed of two oncologists, two
internists, and a pathologist. An end point was considered conﬁrmed
when the end-point review process was completed. Through Decem-
ber 15, 1995, a total of 2420 end points had been reported: 1446 can-
cers (in 1353 participants) and 974 deaths. Of the initial reports of

lung cancer for which the end-point–review process was completed,
90 percent were conﬁrmed; most of the remainder were found to be
metastases and recurrences.

Statistical Analysis

The primary analysis, based on the intention to treat, was designed
to test for differences between treatment groups in the incidence of
lung cancer with a weighted log-rank statistic stratiﬁed according to
the risk group (workers exposed to asbestos or heavy smokers), time
of recruitment (pilot study or subsequent period), and study center
(six centers).
 Parameter estimates and the results of statistical tests
14
were similar with and without the weighting; we present here the un-
weighted results. Estimates of relative risk and conﬁdence intervals
were obtained from stratiﬁed Cox regression models with the same
strata  as  the  log-rank  statistics.  The  cumulative  incidence  of  end
⁄
points was plotted through 5
 years of follow-up because of the small
1
2
number  of  participants  beyond  that  time  and  involved  354  partici-
pants with new cases of lung cancer, 829 deaths, and 67,449 person-
years of follow-up. Follow-up for all participants began at randomi-
zation.

The prespeciﬁed monitoring policy for stopping the trial early be-
cause of a beneﬁt or adverse effect of the study vitamins was based
on O’Brien–Fleming boundaries
 applied to the weighted number of
18
conﬁrmed lung-cancer end points, the primary end point. The critical
P values were those of 0.0006 or lower for the ﬁrst interim analysis
in 1994 and those of 0.007 or lower for the second interim analysis in
1995. Results are based on active intervention through December 15,
1995, at which time the 18,314 participants had accumulated 73,135
person-years of follow-up (mean, 4.0 years; median, 3.7).

ESULTS

Characteristics of the Participants

The two randomized groups were well matched, with
a high-risk proﬁle for lung cancer and cardiovascular
disease in both the smokers and the workers exposed
to asbestos (Table 1). All smokers were encouraged and
assisted, if willing, to stop smoking, and all former smok-
ers  were  encouraged  to  maintain  that  status.  Among
current smokers, there was a net smoking-cessation rate
of 5 percent per year.

Through  December  15,  1995,  15  percent  of  the
workers exposed to asbestos who were assigned to ac-
tive  treatment  became  inactive  participants,  as  com-
pared  with  14  percent  of  those  assigned  to  placebo.
The  respective  values  in  the  group  of  heavy  smokers
were 20 percent and 19 percent. Among the active par-
ticipants, the mean rates of capsule consumption were
93 percent through ﬁve years of follow-up, with no sig-
niﬁcant  differences  between  treatment  groups.  The
percentage of participants who took non–study-relat-
ed  supplemental  beta  carotene  or  vitamin  A  in  doses
of more than 5500 IU per day was low (2 percent and
1 percent, respectively). After ﬁve years of study sup-
plementation, the median serum beta carotene concen-
tration in the active-treatment group was 2100 ng per
milliliter, as compared with 170 ng per milliliter in the
placebo group; serum retinol levels were about 10 per-

agnosed conditions.

Incidence of Lung Cancer

The  incidence  of  lung  cancer  was  the  primary  end
point. Through December 15, 1995, 388 participants —
2 percent of the total — were reported to have new cas-
es  of  lung  cancer  (5.4  per  1000  person-years).  In  the
case of 286, the end points were conﬁrmed, whereas in
the case of 102, further review by the end-points com-
mittee was pending. Among the 388, 254 had died. Five
participants  had  two  primary  lung  cancers  each.  The
388 participants represent 79 percent of the 490 partic-
ipants  projected  in  our  statistical  design  to  have  lung
cancer by the end of the intervention. The 73,135 per-
son-years  of  follow-up  accrued  correspond  to  66  per-
cent of the total of 110,000 person-years projected.
14

The active-treatment group had a relative risk of lung
cancer  of  1.28  (95  percent  conﬁdence  interval,  1.04  to
1.57;  P
0.02),  as  compared  with  the  placebo  group
(Table 2). This result includes relative risks of 1.40 (95
percent conﬁdence interval, 0.95 to 2.07) for workers ex-
posed to asbestos, 1.42 (95 percent conﬁdence interval,
1.07 to 1.87) for heavy smokers who were smoking at the
time of randomization, and 0.80 (95 percent conﬁdence
interval,  0.48  to  1.31)  for  heavy  smokers  who  were  no
longer smoking at the time of randomization. There was
no  statistical  evidence  of  heterogeneity  of  the  relative
risk among these subgroups. Figure 1 shows the cumu-
lative incidence of lung cancer after randomization; the
incidence  in  the  active-treatment  and  placebo  groups
was virtually identical for the ﬁrst 18 months. There was
no  statistically  signiﬁcant  effect  of  the  intervention  on

survival after the diagnosis of lung cancer (relative risk
of survival after diagnosis of lung cancer in the active-
treatment group as compared with the placebo group,
1.05; 95 percent conﬁdence interval, 0.80 to 1.37).

Incidence of Other Cancers

Active  treatment  had  no  statistically  signiﬁcant  ef-
fect on the risk of mesothelioma. There were 23 cases:
14 in the active-treatment group and 9 in the placebo
group.  The  remaining  1030  new  cases  of  cancer  (in-
cluding the 300 prostate cancers, the second most com-
mon cancer in this population) were distributed nearly
evenly between the two treatment groups.

Mortality Rates

⫽

⫽

As shown in Table 2 and Figure 2, the mortality rate
was  17  percent  higher  in  the  active-treatment  group
than in the placebo group (P
0.02). Among the pop-
ulation of heavy smokers, the relative risk was not sig-
niﬁcantly different between those who were smoking at
the time of randomization and those who were no long-
er smoking at that time (relative risk, 1.15 vs. 1.06).

Analysis according to the cause of death (conﬁrmed
causes  only;  n
764)  showed  that  in  the  active-treat-
ment group, as compared with the placebo group, the
relative risk of death from any cause was 1.18 (95 per-
cent conﬁdence interval, 1.02 to 1.37); of death from lung
cancer, 1.46 (95 percent conﬁdence interval, 1.07 to 2.00);
and of death from cardiovascular causes

there  was  no  signiﬁcant  difference  between  treatment
groups in the incidence of death from
all causes during the ﬁrst 24 months.
A  review  of  all  causes  of  death  re-
vealed no additional statistically sig-

test the hypothesis that beta carotene

beneﬁcial effect of beta carotene or vitamin A, in spite of
the large advantages inferred from observational epide-
miologic  comparisons  of  extreme  quintiles  or  quartiles
of dietary intake of fruits and vegetables or of dietary in-
take or serum levels of beta carotene or vitamin A.

With 73,135 person-years of follow-up, the active-treat-
ment group had a 28 percent higher incidence of lung
cancer than the placebo group, and the overall mortality
rate  and  the  rate  of  death  from  cardiovascular  causes
were higher by 17 percent and 26 percent, respectively.
These  results  conﬁrm  and  extend  the  unexpected
results reported for beta carotene in the ATBC Cancer
Prevention  Study  in  Finland.
  We  cannot  distinguish
10
the  effects  of  beta  carotene  from  those  of  vitamin  A,
since the two agents were administered in combination,
under the hypothesis that they might have a favorable
effect through complementary molecular actions.

The second interim analysis led our safety and end-
points monitoring committee and steering committee to
recognize the extremely limited prospect of a favorable
overall effect, as well as the possibility of true adverse
effects. The decision to stop the intervention was made
by the steering committee on January 11, 1996. It is pos-
sible that the excess mortality in the active-treatment
group may have vanished or become statistically insig-
niﬁcant  with  completion  of  the  intended  intervention
period plus several years of follow-up; such reversals of
ﬁndings  have  occurred  both  in  the  course  of  a  single
 and in subsequent random-
large, randomized trial
ized  trials  of  the  same  agent  or  class  of  agents.
23-25
However, it was impossible to ignore the results of the
ATBC Cancer Prevention Study
 in deciding whether
10
to stop the active-intervention phase.

We have no explanation for the possible adverse as-
sociations that we have observed to date. There was no
evidence of systemic toxicity in any organ from the vi-
tamin A or, except for the expected skin yellowing, the
beta carotene. The regimen did not produce clinically
important  hypertriglyceridemia.
  We  considered  con-
tinuing the trial with the retinyl palmitate alone; how-
ever, the need to rerandomize, the extended follow-up
required, and the uncertainty about the involvement of
the vitamin A made this plan infeasible.

In this trial, beta carotene treatment raised the me-
dian serum beta carotene levels to 12 times the base-
line levels and the placebo group’s median values. Such
levels may conceivably be toxic or at least cause serious
disequilibrium with other compounds important to re-
dox relations or other cellular mechanisms. Beta caro-
tene has been postulated to have a pro-oxidant effect
under certain nonphysiologic conditions.
 One study
reported that the administration of beta carotene dras-
tically  lowered  vitamin  E  levels,
  and  three
 have found no such effect. In prelim-
other groups
inary analyses of serum beta carotene levels during ac-
tive treatment, we could ﬁnd no support for the hypoth-
esis that subjects with the highest serum levels of beta
carotene were at greater risk for lung cancer or death
from cardiovascular causes, cancer, or any cause.

the widely accepted conclusion drawn from observation-
al epidemiologic studies that beta carotene is a primary
component responsible for the association of lower risks
of  cancer  and  death  from  cardiovascular  causes  with
high  intakes  of  fruits  and  vegetables.19,33  Such  studies
typically  compare  extreme  subgroups  for  such  dietary
features,  ignoring  or  only  crudely  adjusting  for  many
other potentially relevant variables, such as the intake of
red meat, physical activity, life situations, and other be-
havior.20 The dietary associations seemed well matched
to serum beta carotene measurements; as in other obser-
vational analyses, in our study base-line serum beta car-
otene  levels  were  inversely  correlated  with  the  subse-
quent incidence of lung cancer in both groups. However,
randomized prevention trials are needed to test the hy-
pothesis that increased beta carotene intake can be pro-
tective.

The results of four large-scale chemoprevention tri-
als of beta carotene and related agents can be summa-
rized. The ATBC Cancer Prevention Study10 tested dai-
ly supplementation with 20 mg of beta carotene and 50
mg of alpha-tocopherol (two-by-two factorial design) in
29,133  male  smokers.  The  Physicians’  Health  Study11
tested supplementation with 50 mg of beta carotene on
alternate days in 22,071 male physicians, 50 percent of
whom  had  never  smoked,  39  percent  of  whom  were
former smokers, and 11 percent of whom were currently
smoking. We tested daily supplementation with a com-
bination of 30 mg of beta carotene and 25,000 IU of ret-
inyl  palmitate.  Finally,  a  study  conducted  in  Linxian,
China,34  assessed  the  value  of  daily  supplementation
with a combination of 15 mg of beta carotene, 50 mg of
selenium, and 30 mg of alpha-tocopherol as compared
with three other combinations of vitamins and minerals
in a complex factorial design in 29,584 adults presumed

to be vitamin- and mineral-deﬁcient — a very different
population from those examined in the other studies. In
the ATBC Cancer Prevention Study, 876 new cases of
lung cancer were diagnosed, yielding a relative risk of
lung cancer of 1.18 among subjects who received beta
carotene  (with  or  without  alpha-tocopherol),  as  com-
pared with those who did not. In the Physicians’ Health
Study, 170 new cases of lung cancer were diagnosed, for
a relative risk of lung cancer of 0.93 among men taking
beta  carotene,  as  compared  with  those  who  received
placebo. In our study, there were 388 new cases of lung
cancer,  yielding  a  relative  risk  of  such  cancer  of  1.28
among the subjects who received beta carotene and ret-
inyl  palmitate,  as  compared  with  those  who  received
placebo.  The  Linxian  study  did  not  report  the  inci-
dence of lung cancer. Among the subjects who received
beta carotene, the relative risk of death from any cause
was  1.08  in  the  ATBC  Cancer Prevention Study  (3570
deaths),  1.01  in  the  Physicians’  Health  Study  (1947
deaths), 1.17 in our trial (974 deaths), and 0.91 in the
Linxian study (2127 deaths).

Reversing or overcoming lifelong metabolic or exog-
enous risk factors may require 5 to 10 years or more to
account for the latent periods of cancers. Favorable ef-
fects may be particularly difﬁcult to achieve in the face
of a continuing carcinogenic and atherogenic assault in
smokers;  alternatively,  antioxidants  and  antiprolifera-
tive  agents  might  act  on  the  constituents  of  cigarette
smoke. Long-term follow-up both during and after ac-
tive treatment with potential chemopreventive agents is
essential if we are to have any hope of observing long-
term  beneﬁts  and  evaluating  long-term  risks.  During
the postintervention follow-up of our study subjects, as
end points continue to accrue, we will conduct labora-
tory analyses and analyze various subgroups, particu-
larly former smokers.

Our ﬁndings provide important new information with
respect to public policy and public health. When these
results are combined with those from the ATBC Cancer
Prevention Study10 and the Physicians’ Health Study,11
they make it clear that there can be little enthusiasm
about the efﬁcacy or safety of supplemental beta caro-
tene  or  vitamin  A  in  efforts  to  reduce  the  burdens  of
cancer or heart disease in certain populations. Howev-
er, we still recommend the dietary intake of fruits and
vegetables.

Other agents that prevent lung cancer and coronary
heart disease must be identiﬁed and subjected to rig-
orous  trials  of  safety  and  efﬁcacy.  Meanwhile,  to  re-
duce the risk of these diseases we must rely primarily
on three approaches: smoking cessation, prevention of
smoking, and avoidance of occupational and environ-
mental exposure to carcinogenic substances.

We are indebted to the study subjects, staff members, and investi-
gators; to the members of the safety and end-points monitoring com-
mittee  over  the  past  several  years  (Anthony  Miller,  Robert  Bruce,
Julie Buring, Frank Iber, and O. Dale Williams); and to our colleagues
who provided data from the Physicians’ Health Study.
