tenure as a graduate student with the Millers at the University of  Wisconsin 
[I]. In  the  rnid-l960s,  we  discovered that  the  compound N-benzoyloxy-N- 
methyl-4-aminoazobenzene  acted as a model ultimate carcinogen for the ar- 
omatic  aminoazo  dye  carcinogens.  The  reaction  with  methionine  of  this 
compound  in  virro,  and  of  the  presumptive N-hydroxy  metabolite  in  vivo, 
laid the  basis for the  identification  of  the  metabolic activation  of  aromatic 
aminoazo dye  carcinogens  [ l ,   21.  Earlier,  for  reasons  wholly  unrelated  to 
the N-oxidation of  aromatic amines, the  Millers, in  1953, had  suggested “a 
methyl deletion hypothesis”  as a possible mechanism for aminoazo dye car- 
cinogenesis [3]. Other professors who contributed to my  interest in this area 
of  research were: Dr.  Charles Heidelberger through his  studies on  the  syn- 
thesis and  biochemical activity of  5-fluorodeoxyuridine; through  its  inhibi- 
tion of  the enzyme thymidylate synthetase, this compound upsets the labile 
I-carbon  pool  in  cells  [4]. Finally,  the  influence of  Dr.  Carl  A.  Bauman, 
who was then a professor in the Department of  Biochemistry at the Univer- 
sity of  Wisconsin, and  who emphasized the importance of  both  dietary  de- 
ficiency and  antimetabolites as means of obtaining nutritional deficiencies, 
can be  seen  throughout this presentation. 

11.  HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT PRIOR TO 1980 

The major scientific developments showing possible causal links between 
methyl  group  insufficiency  and  hepatocarcinogenesis  in  vivo  are  summa- 
rized 
in  Table  1  [5-15].  The  hepatocarcinogenic  activity  of  choline- 
deficient diets was first reported in  1946 [5]. These early observations were 
extended to  other  species  and  organs but  were eventually called  into ques- 
tion because of  the discovery of  aflatoxin contamination in the peanut  meal 
diets  used  to  achieve a  low  methyl  content  in  the  diet  [16]. From  1955 to 
1983, no  major  studies  appeared  in  the  literature  describing  the  complete 
carcinogenic activity of  choline-deficient diets. Yet,  other studies continued 
to  provide  indications  that  hepatocarcinogenesis was  frequently associated 
with  or enhanced  by  methyl  insufficiency (Table  I).  Also,  the  administra- 
tion  to  rats  of  the  methionine  antimetabolite  ethionine  [17],  of  the  low- 
lipotrope  diet  of  Newberne  [ 181,  and  of  the  amino-acid-defined,  methyl- 
deficient  diet  of  Poirier  (191,  all  provided  evidence  of  hepatic  methyl 
insufficiency either  with  low  levels of  S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) or  of 
macromolecular hypomethylat ion  [ 201.  Finally,  the  results  of  LaPeyre  and 
Becker  [ 151 clearly  showed that  the administration of  the  hepatocarcinogen 
2-acetylaminofluorene,  under  conditions  leading  to  liver tumor  formation, 
also led to  the hypomethylation of  hepatic  DNA.

Findings 

Choline-deficient diets, con- 
taining peanut meal or soy- 
bean  meal, caused  liver 
cancer in  rats and  mice. 
These diets were  later- shown 
to  be  contaminated with  the 
liver carcinogen aflatoxin. 

The methionine antagonist 

ethionine caused liver cancer 
in  rats. 

Chronic administration of  liver 

carcinogens or of  methyl- 
deficient diets to rats led to 
similar biochemical changes 
in  the  liver, including de- 
creased hepatic SAM. 
A  low-lipotrope (methyl- 

deficient) diet enhanced the 
activities of  several hepato- 
carcinogens in  rats. 

A  choline-devoid diet exerted 

both  cocarcinogenic and 
tumor-promoting activities 
toward the  livers of  rats. 

Feeding a carcinogenic regime 
of  2-acetylaminofluorene to 
rats led  to DNA  hypomethy- 
lation in  the liver. 

111.  HEPATOCARCINOGENESIS  AND 

BIOCHEMICAL CHANGES 

Beginning  in  1983,  three  publications  clearly  showed  that  carcinogen- 
free  methyl-deficient diets caused  liver cancer in  rats  [21-231.  In  the  first 
study, Mikol  et  al.  [21], using  an  amino acid-defined diet,  showed  that  a 

POI R I ER 

diet  lacking methionine and choline produced  liver cancer by  itself  and  en- 
hanced  liver tumor formation  in  rats given a single initiating dose of  dieth- 
ylnitrosame.  Ghoshal  and  Farber  [22]  and  Yokoyama  et  al.  [23],  using 
alcohol-extracted,  peanut-meal-containing  diets,  obtained  similar  tumor 
yields in the livers of  male rats. Thus, the hepatocarcinogenicity of  choline 
or methyl deprivation  seemed to be  clearly established.  In fact, most of  the 
biochemical  changes  commonly  associated  with  liver  tumor  formation  by 
chemical carcinogens were also seen during hepatocarcinogenesis by  methyl 
deprivation.  These  included: the  accumulation of  lipid  peroxides  [24, 251, 
increased levels  of  ornithine  and  SAM decarboxylases  [ 191,  increased thy- 
midine  incorporation into liver DNA  [26], decreased levels of  histidase and 
urocanase (271, and  finally, increased formation of  altered hepatic foci [28, 
291.  The  latter  findings  were  particularly  interesting  from  a  potentially 
mechanistic standpoint.  In  the absence of  diethylnitrosamine initiation,  the 
chronic feeding of  the amino-acid-defined diet, lacking both methionine and 
choline,  led  to  the  formation  of  altered  hepatic  foci  which  continuously 
increased  in  volume  but  not  in  number; this observation  is  consistent with 
the  hypothesis  that  methyl  deprivation  is  not  a  continuously  initiating 
stress,  but  rather  is a highly effective promoter of  preexisting,  initiated  he- 
patocytes  [28]. The  strong  liver-tumor-promoting activity  of  choline  defi- 
ciency  had  been  previously  described  [ 301. 

While  the  effects  of  dietary  methyl  deficiency  on  hepatocarcinogenesis 
were  being  explored,  other  investigations  were  conducted  on  the  interac- 
tions  between  hepatocarcinogens  and  liver tumor  promoters and  labile me- 
thyl  groups.  In  particular,  the  effects  of  such  interactions  in  liver  tumor 
formation,  on  the  hepatic  levels  of  SAM,  and  on  the  DNA  content  of  5- 
methyldeoxycytidine (5-MC) were determined.  The results are summarized 
in  Table 2 [8, 9,  12,  15,  18. 21,  31-39].  The hepatocarcinogenic activities 
of  three  of  the  four carcinogens  examined-ethionine, 
diethylnitrosamine, 
and  2-acetylaminofluorene-were 
shown  to  be  enhanced  by  dietary  lipo- 
trope deficiency or to be  inhibited by  high dietary  levels of  methionine and/ 
or  choline  (Table 2). In  one  study,  lipotrope deficiency  was  not  shown  to 
exert any  significant effect upon  the hepatocarcinogenic activity of  dimeth- 
ylnitrosamine [ 121. Further, the liver-tumor-promoting activity of  phenobar- 
bital  and  of  DDT was  suppressed in  rodents by  the  feeding of  high  dietary 
levels of  methionine and choline (Table 2)  1311. A11  six of  the hepatocarci- 
nogenic  stressors whose  activity  was  inhibited  by  methyl donors  were  also 
shown  to  decrease  the  hepatic  content  of  SAM  or  the  ratio  of  SAM  to S- 
adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) in  the  livers of  chronically fed  rats (Table 2). 
SAH is both  a  product of  and  a  strong inhibitor of  SAM-dependent methy- 
lations  [40]. Similarly, four such  carcinogenic regimes led  to  decreased  5- 
MC  in  hepatic  DNA  under  chronic  feeding conditions  (Table  2)  (15,  35-

IV.  ALTERATIONS IN ONCOGENES DURING 

HEPATOCARCINOGENESIS BY  METHYL  DEPRIVATION 

The early association between decreased hepatic SAM and DNA hypom- 
ethylation led  to the proposal that  increased oncogene expression caused by 
such  hypomethylat ion  was  a  causative  factor  in  hepatocarcinogenesis  by 
methyl  deficiency.  This  hypothesis  was  supported  by  a  number  of  related 
observations.  Specific gene hypomethylation has been commonly associated 
with  increased expression [41]. Two  DNA  hypomethylating agents,  the  an- 
timetabolites  ethionine  and  5-azacytidine,  altered  differentiation  of  Friend 
erythroleukemia cells in vitro [42]. 5-Azacytidine transformed cells in  vitro 
[43] and  enhanced  liver tumor formation  in  vivo [44, 451.  SAM-dependent 
DNA  methylation  inhibited  the  transforming  activity  of  the  Moloney 
sarcoma  virus  in  virro  [46].  Generalized  DNA  hypomethylation  was 

I90 

POIRIER 

commonly seen in the tumors and transformed cells compared to the tissues 
and  cells of  origin  [47].  Finally,  the  H-rus  oncogene  of  colon  carcinomas 
was hypomethylated compared to the adjacent normal tissue  1481. Our own 
studies showed that the  18-month feeding of  any of  several methyl-deficient 
amino-acid-defined diets led to hypomethylation of  the c-H-rus and c-K-rus 
oncogenes in  both  neoplastic  and  preneoplastic  liver 149). More  recent  re- 
sults showed that  1- to 32-week feeding of the carcinogenic methyl-deficient 
amino-acid-defined  diet  resulted  in  the  hypomethylation  of  CCGG  se- 
quences  in  the  c-H-rus,  the  c-K-rus,  and  the  clfos  protooncogenes  at  all 
times  investigated  [50].  In  fact,  the  methylation  changes  in  the  c-H-rus 
gene  increased  in  intensity  throughout  the  experimental  period  until  at  32 
weeks they  resembled those  seen  in  the  livers of  rats  fed  the same diet  for 
18  months.  Slot-blot  analyses of  the  same livers showed increased expres- 
sion  of  the  same  three  protoncogenes correlating  with  decreased  methyla- 
tion  [5 I].  These  results  demonstrate  early  selective  hypomethylation  of 
some  CCGG  sites,  accompanied  by  increased  gene  expression,  in  rats 
undergoing hepatocarcinogenesis  by  dietary  methyl deprivation.  All  of  the 
oncogene  changes  described  above  were 
independent  of  carcinogen 
administrat ion. 

Several  other  laboratories  have  investigated  the  correlations  between 
DNA  methylation  and  oncogene  expression  during  hepatocarcinogenesis. 
Wainfan,  Christman,  and  their  collaborators  [52,  531  showed  that  the 
chronic  administration  to  rats  of  an  amino-acid-defined,  methyl-deficient 
diet  for  1-4  weeks led  to the following: ( I )   DNA hypomethylation as mea- 
sured by  SAM-dependent, methyl acceptor activity; (2) increased DNA  me- 
thylase activity;  (3) increased expression and  decreased  methylation of  the 
protooncogenes c-myc, c-fos,  and c-Hi-rus; and  (4) no change in the expres- 
sion  of  methylation of  the  c-K-ras  oncogene.  All  of  the  changes observed 
by  this group could be reversed by  placing the animals on the corresponding 
methyl-adequate  diet  for  1-2  weeks  [52,  531. The  group  of  Locker  and 
Lombardi  has  examined  the  hepatocarcinogenenic  effects  of  a  choline- 
devoid diet on the amplification and methylation of  the c-myc protoncogene 
1541. They found that:  (1) c-myc was amplified  2-  to  70-fold  in  all  tumors 
produced  by  the diet; (2) relative c-myc transcript  levels increased with  the 
stages of neoplasia; (3) hypomethylation of  c-myc was observed in the livers 
of  rats  fed the choline-devoid diet for  12 or more months; and (4) the c-myc 
gene  in  tumors  showed  varying  degrees  both  of  hypermethylation  and  of 
specific  site hypomethylation.  In  related  studies,  Feo and  his  collaborators 
[55]  investigated  SAMEAH  ratios  as  well  as  oncogene  methylation  and 
expression in the persistent nodules produced  in the livers of  rats  treated by 
a  modified  Soh-Farber  regime  [56]. They  found  the  following changes  in 
the  persistent nodules:  (1) decreased  SAM/SAH ratios  to  40%  of  controls;

(2) decreased  5-MC content  to  50% of  control  values;  (3) 4-  to  6-fold  in- 
creases in the c-K-rus, c-H-rus, and c-myc RNA transcripts; and (4) hypom- 
ethylation of  all three protoncogenes investigated [ 5 5 ] .  Chronic treatment of 
such animals with SAM led  to partial, but marked, reversal of all molecular 
changes  noted  1571.  In  an  extension  of  these  studies,  the  same  group 
showed  that  the  chronic  administration  of  SAM  itself  markedly  inhibited 
the  tumor-promoting activity of  phenobarbital  in  rats  previously treated  by 
the Soh-Farber  regimen  (Table 3) [58]. 

While  the  changes  described  above essentially  describe  correlations  be- 
tween  oncogene  hypomethylation  and  activation,  other  results  recently 
showed  a  high  frequency of  mutations  in  the p53  gene  in  the  DNA  from 
tumors  caused  by  choline  deprivation  [59].  In  preliminary  studies,  DNA 
from tumors derived from the livers of  rats fed amino-acid-defined, methyl- 
deficient diets transformed NIH-3T3 cells [49]. However, in this study, only 
4  of  28  tumor  DNA  samples  examined  exhibited  transfecting  activity;  all 
showed  amplified  H-ras  in  the  transfectants.  However,  all  of  the  positive 
DNA  samples  came  from  diethylnitrosamine-initiated rats;  none  of  the 
DNA  samples  from  the  uninitiated  rats  fed  the  severely  methyl-deficient 
diets  transformed  NIH-3T3  cells  [49].  In  more  recent  studies,  DNA  sam- 
ples  from  liver tumors developing in  rats  fed  the  methionine- and choline- 
deficient  diet,  as  well  as  from  cells  obtained  from 
these  tumors, 
transformed NIH-3T3 cells; the cells displayed c-myc amplification  [60]. 

In  summary, the  molecular biological studies conducted to date on  hepa- 
tocarcinogenesis by  dietary  methyl deprivation  indicate that  while hypome- 
thylation  and  increased  expression  of  c-H-rus,  c-K-rus,  and  c-fos  have 
all  been  observed,  their role  in carcinogenesis,  in the absence of  an  initiat- 
ing  agent,  remains  to  be  established.  On  the  other  hand,  the  presence  of 
activated  myc  and  mutated  p53  genes  in  the  tumors  of  animals  fed  the 

192 

POIRIER 

methyl-deficient  diets  without  any  further  carcinogen  treatment  suggests 
that such changes are likely to play a causative role in carcinogenesis in this 
system. 

V.  ALTERNATE MECHANISMS 

While  the  prospective  mechanism  of  carcinogenesis  by  methyl  insuffi- 
ciency  emphasized  in  this  presentation  is  enhanced  oncogene  expression 
caused by  gene hypomethylation, other mechanisms may  be  responsible for 
such biological effects. Chief among the hypotheses proposed are mutations 
produced  by  varying  mechanisms such  as oxidative  damage  [61. 621,  ab- 
normal  DNA  methylation  [63, 641,  and  altered deoxynucleotide pool  sizes 
1651. Consistent with  a hypothesis that oxidative damage to DNA results in 
the mutations leading to cancer are the observations that the chronic admin- 
istration of choline-deficient diets leads to: ( I )   single-strand breaks 1611; (2) 
high  hepatic  levels of  peroxidized lipids  [61, 661;  (3) the  inhibition of  al- 
tered hepatic foci induced by  choline deprivation through feeding of  antiox- 
idants [67]; and (4) the formation of  8-hydroxyguanine in hepatic DNA  [62, 
681. On the other hand,  a recent elegant study of  Shen et al.  [64] has shown 
that  the  transfection  of  the  Hpa  11  methylase  gene  into  bacteria  lacking 
uracil-DNA  glycosylase  results  in  a  high  frequency  of  C  to  U  transition 
mutations  in  the  absence of  the  substrate  SAM.  Such  mutations  were  re- 
duced  to  background  levels  by  high  levels of  SAM  or  SAH  [64]. These 
results are consistent with  previous findings that a high  proportion of  inac- 
tivating mutations in the p53  gene in colorectal cancer occur at methylation 
sites on  DNA  [69] and  that the cytosine complex with  methylase is chemi- 
cally  susceptible  to  deamination  unless  it  is  rapidly  methylated  with  SAM 
[70]. Finally, the control exerted by  SAM on  folate distribution  is expected 
to alter the deoxynucleotide pool  sizes in target tissues [71]. This is clearly 
the case in the spleens of  rats fed diets deficient in  folate,  methionine,  and 
choline (Table 4) [72]. Significant decreases in the dGTP,  dATP, and dTMP 
were  noted  in  the  spleens  of  rats  fed  a  folate-deficient  or  a  methionine/ 
choline-deficient diet. 

Extensions to other organs of  such studies indicate that physiological me- 
thyl  insufficiency  may  contribute  to  carcinogenesis  to  biological  systems 
other  than  the  livers  of  choline-deficient  rats.  For  example,  a  number  of 
observations  have  linked  the  abnormal  differentiation  of  pancreatic  acinar 
cells with  an  inadequate supply of  methyl donors. Thus,  pancreatic  degen- 
eration  is a common feature of  ethionine toxicity  in  rodents  [8]. Pancreatic

acinar cells from  hamster embryos differentiate normally only  in  the  pres- 
ence of  such methyl group sources as methionine, choline, and  SAM  [73]. 
Further, hepatization  of  pancreatic  acinar cells  occurs  in  hamsters treated 
sequentially with ethionine and a choline-devoid diet 1741. Finally, such hep- 
atization of  pancreatic acinar cells is seen in  rats chronically fed an amino- 
acid-defined methyl-deficient diet  1751.  Recent results from  the  studies by 
Lyn-Cook at NCTR  176-791  have tended to  increase the number of  associ- 
ations found between methyl insufficiency, DNA  hypomethylation, and sus- 
ceptibility  to  transformation  by  pancreatic  acinar  cells  (Table  5).  For 
example, pancreatic acinar cells in  vitro  acquire hepatocyte-like properties 
following treatment with  the  DNA-hypomethylating agent  azacytidine  (Ta- 
ble  5). Also,  pancreatic acinar cells derived from rats  undergoing  hepato- 
carcinogenesis by  methyl  deprivation  seem  to  transform  more  readily  in 
vitro than do the corresponding cells from control animals [79]. 

The evidence currently available indicates that in humans, folate depriva- 
tion  may  contribute  strongly  to  a  methyl  insufficiency  in  vivo.  Our  own 
interests in this area occurred with the discovery that HIV-infected patients 
had  low  levels of  both  SAM  and  NS-methyltetrahydrofolate in  their  cere-

brospinal  fluid  (80, 811.  Normally,  low  SAM  arising  from  dietary  methyl 
insufficiency  is  accompanied  by  an  increased  proportion  of  tissue  NS- 
methyltetrahydrofolate [71]. Thus, the prospect  arose that  the  low  SAM  in 
these  patients  was  a  consequence and  not  a  cause  of  the  one-carbon  defi- 
ciency  noted  in  these patients  1821. Other  studies have  increased the  num- 
ber  of  associations  between  folate  deficiency,  physiological  methyl  group 
insufficiency in  vivo,  and  cancer  formation  in  humans  (Table 6) [83-941. 
At  present,  however, we  are unaware  of  any  clear evidence  indicating  that 
in  humans folate deficiency results in  methyl  insufficiency in  any organ. 

In  rats,  however,  the  situation  is  different.  Within  the  last  few  years, 
Walzem and Clifford (951 developed an  amino-acid-defined, folate-deficient 
diet permitting the long-term survival of  rats. The chronic administration of 
these diets to rats has resulted in: ( I )  significant general hypomethylation of

Alcohol  induces  both  hepatotoxicity and  folate  deficiency  in  humans  and 
experimental  animals;  its  hepatotoxic  effects  can  be  inhibited  by  SAM 
[ 85-90]. 

Clinical  studies  have  shown  an  association  between  folate  deficiency  and 
dysplasia  in  the  cervical,  bronchial,  and  colonic  epithelium,  as  well  as 
with  colon tumor formation  (91-941.

liver DNA  [96]; (2) 57-88%  decreases in  the pancreatic ratios of  SAM to 
SAH, chiefly by  large  increases in  SAH  1971; and (3) enhanced formation 
of  dysplasia and  of  neoplastic  lesions  in  the  colon  of  dimethylhydrazine- 
treated rats (981. Thus, it appears reasonable to propose that the physiolog- 
ical  insufficiency of  methyl donors that occurs in  rats as a consequence of 
either choline or methionine deficiency may  also be  seen  in  humans, espe- 
cially under conditions of  toxic stress.
