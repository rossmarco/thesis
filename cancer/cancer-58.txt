ABSTRACT Animal studies have, in general, been supportive of a protective effect of ﬁsh and ﬁsh (n-3) PUFA
against breast cancer risk; but the epidemiologic evidence of such a relationship is limited. Case-control and cohort
studies have rarely shown signiﬁcant associations. The association between total ﬁsh intake and the effect of fat
content and preparation method of the ﬁsh, in relation to the incidence rate ratios of breast cancer, were
investigated among postmenopausal women. We also investigated the effect of ﬁsh intake with respect to estrogen
receptor expression of breast cancer tumors. A total of 23,693 postmenopausal women from the prospective study
“Diet, Cancer and Health” were included in the study. During follow-up, 424 women were diagnosed with breast
cancer. The incidence rate ratio (IRR) and 95% CI per each additional 25 g of mean daily intake of ﬁsh were 1.13
(CI, 1.03–1.23). Analysis of fatty ﬁsh gave IRR of 1.11 (CI, 0.91–1.34), and the result for lean ﬁsh was 1.13 (CI,
0.99 –1.29). When ﬁsh intake was stratiﬁed into three types of preparation methods, the IRR for fried ﬁsh was 1.09
(CI, 0.95–1.25), for boiled ﬁsh 1.09 (CI, 0.85–1.42), and for processed ﬁsh 1.12 (CI, 0.93–1.34). The IRR per
additional 25 g of mean daily intake of ﬁsh was 1.14 (CI, 1.03–1.26) for estrogen receptor–positive (ER⫹) and 1.00
(CI, 0.81–1.24) for estrogen receptor–negative (ER⫺) breast cancer. In conclusion, this study showed that higher
intakes of ﬁsh were signiﬁcantly associated with higher incidence rates of breast cancer. The association was
present only for development of ER⫹ breast cancer.

Fish is a major food group worldwide. It is a source of high
quality protein and contains all essential amino acids, while
contributing to the intake of fat-soluble vitamins such as A and
D, and trace elements such as selenium and iodine. In many
countries, health authorities advise the population to eat more
ﬁsh; the Danish population, for instance, is advised to eat 200–
300 g of ﬁsh per week (1). In addition, a high proportion of the
population takes supplements containing ﬁsh (n-3) PUFA.

Epidemiologic investigations studying how intake of ﬁsh and
ﬁsh PUFA inﬂuences the occurrence of cancer, however, have
not been conclusive. A report by the World Cancer Research
Fund in 1997 concluded that ﬁsh may be protective against
cancers of the colon, rectum, breast and ovary; but the evidence
was considered insufﬁcient (2). Long-chain (n-3) fatty acids, of
which ﬁsh oil is a rich source, have consistently been shown to
inhibit the growth of human breast cancer cells both in culture
and in explants in immunosuppressed mice (3); but the epidemi-
ological evidence of a protective effect comes mainly from eco-
logical studies of breast cancer incidence and mortality (4–7).
Most case-control and cohort studies have focused on ﬁsh intake
rather than the intake of ﬁsh PUFA. We identiﬁed 20 case-

control studies relating ﬁsh intake to breast cancer. Although the
majority of these showed no signiﬁcant relationship (8–23), three
showed a signiﬁcant reduction in the risk of breast cancer with
increasing ﬁsh intake (24–26); in the study of Hirose et al. (26),
this was the case only among postmenopausal women. One study
actually showed a signiﬁcant increase in risk with increasing ﬁsh
intake (27). A recent pooled analysis of eight cohort studies,
including 7379 women who were diagnosed with breast cancer
during up to 15 y of follow-up, found an incidence rate of 1.01 for
a 100 g/d increment in ﬁsh consumption (28). In a recent review
of the epidemiologic literature on intake of ﬁsh and marine fatty
acids and the risks of hormone-related cancers, the authors con-
cluded that although the development and progression of breast
cancer appears to be affected by processes in which eicosapentaenoic
acid (EPA)3 and docosahexaenoic acids (DHA) play important
roles, it remains unclear whether the consumption of ﬁsh con-
taining marine fatty acids can alter the risk of these cancers (29).
Given the clinical relevance of hormone receptors, there
has been interest in determining whether epidemiologic risk
factors for breast cancer differ by estrogen and progesterone

receptor status (30). Some studies have investigated dietary
risk factors and estrogen receptor (ER)-speciﬁc breast cancer
(31–36). One of these addressed the intake of ﬁsh and found
that, among postmenopausal women, a frequent (weekly) con-
sumption of ﬁsh was associated with an increased risk of ER⫹
tumors and a reduced risk of ER⫺ tumors (32).

The aim of this study was to investigate the association of
ﬁsh intake and breast cancer among postmenopausal women,
and to evaluate whether a possible association was inﬂuenced
by fat content or preparation method of the ﬁsh. Further, we
wanted to investigate possible effects of ﬁsh intake on ER-
speciﬁc breast cancer.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS

In the prospective study “Diet, Cancer and Health,” we invited all
individuals who lived in two selected geographical areas (greater Copen-
hagen and Aarhus) and who fulﬁlled the following criteria: age between
50 and 64 y; born in Denmark; and not registered with a cancer diagnosis
in the Danish Cancer Registry. A total of 29,875 women participated in
the study between December 1993 and May 1997. This corresponds to
37% of the women invited. The study “Diet, Cancer and Health” and
the substudy reported here were approved by the Regional Ethical
Committees on human studies in Copenhagen and Aarhus, and by the
Danish Data Protection Agency.

Dietary information. Dietary information was obtained from a
detailed, 192-item food frequency questionnaire (FFQ), which study
participants received by mail before a visit to one of the two study
clinics. A description of the development and validation of the
questionnaire was published previously (37,38). The FFQ was devel-
oped to obtain information on the subjects’ habitual diet during the
preceding year. Answers to questions on intake of different foods and
dishes were given in 12 different categories, ranging from never to 8
or more times a day. For foods that come in natural units, such as
slices of bread, cups or glasses of different beverages, and pieces of
fruit, participants were asked to average their daily intake of the
relevant unit. For other foods, such as mixed dishes, a sex-speciﬁc
portion size was calculated by using the results from a calibration
study (39). A mean daily intake of foods and nutrients was calculated
by multiplying the frequencies of intake by the portion size, using the
software program FoodCalc (40). A total of 24 of the 192 foods and
recipes in the FFQ covered intakes of different types of ﬁsh, and
questions were speciﬁed according to preparation method. A biomar-
ker study was carried out to validate the information on dietary intake
of fatty acids, including ﬁsh PUFA (41).

Background information and anthropometrical measurements.
During their visit, participants also completed a lifestyle question-
naire, including questions about reproductive factors, health status,
social factors and lifestyle habits. Both the FFQ and the lifestyle
questionnaire were processed during the visit by optical scanning, and
checked so that missing or unclear information could be clariﬁed with
the participant before she left the study clinic. A few missing values
were accepted in the lifestyle questionnaire, but not in the FFQ. From
the lifestyle questionnaire, we obtained information about school
education (short: ⱕ7 y, medium: 8 –10 y, or long: ⬎10 y), parity, age
at birth of ﬁrst child, history of benign breast tumor surgery (yes/no),
use of hormone replacement therapy (HRT; never, past, or current)
and duration of HRT. Furthermore, professional staff members at the
study clinics collected biological material and obtained anthropo-
metrical measurements including height and weight. The BMI was
calculated as weight (kg) per height squared (m2).

A total of 6076 women were excluded from the analysis because
they were later reported to have had a cancer diagnosis before
invitation or were premenopausal (had reported at least one men-
struation no ⬎ 12 mo before entry and no use of HRT); or because
they did not provide complete information on either the exposure
variables or the potential confounding variables. Furthermore, we
excluded 106 women including one case who never ate ﬁsh, both
because they comprised a selected group, which may differ in an
unknown way, and because this group by deﬁnition cannot contribute
any information on how the breast cancer incidence rate differs by

the different amounts of ﬁsh intake, by the fat content of the ﬁsh, or
by the preparation methods of the ﬁsh. Thus a total of 23,693 women
were included in this study, including 5229 women with a history of
oophorectomy, hysterectomy or both (Fig. 1).

Follow-up. Cohort members were identiﬁed by the personal,
10-digit identiﬁcation number, comprising date of birth and a four-
digit running number, which is allocated to every Danish citizen by
the Central Population Register.

All 23,693 cohort members were linked to the Central Population
Register for information on vital status and migration. Information on
cancer occurrence was obtained through record linkage to the Danish
Cancer Register (42), which collects information on all individuals
with cancer in Denmark. Linkage was performed by use of the
personal identiﬁcation number. Each cohort member was followed-up
for breast cancer occurrence from the date of entry (i.e., date of visit
to the study center) until the date of diagnosis of any cancer (except
for nonmelanoma skin cancer), the date of death, the date of emi-
gration or 31 December 2000, whichever came ﬁrst.

In addition to the general Danish Cancer Register, a register
exclusively concerning breast cancer has been established in Den-
mark. Information on ER status was obtained from The Danish Breast
Cancer Co-operative Group, which holds records on a range of details
(e.g., ER status) for ⬃90% of breast cancers diagnosed in Denmark
(43). Although several medical centers were involved, a standardized
immunohistological method was used. The cut-off level used to deﬁne
positive receptor status was 10% or more positive cells. Linkage to the

Danish Breast Cancer Co-operative Group register was performed by
use of the personal identiﬁcation number as well.

Statistical analyses. The analyses of the relation between the
exposure variables and breast cancer rates were based on the Cox
proportional hazard model (including time-dependent variables) us-
ing age as the time axis to ensure that the estimation procedure was
based on comparisons of individuals at the same age. The other time
variable, “time under study,” was included as a time-dependent vari-
able, modeled by a linear spline with a boundary at 1 y after entry into
the study cohort, to allow for a possible “healthy-participants” effect.
In analyses considering ER status, the two types of breast cancer
deﬁned by the receptor status were treated as competing causes of
failure, i.e., in separate analyses, in which breast cancers of the
opposite type were censored by the age at the time of cancer diag-
nosis. Breast cancers with unknown receptor status were censored at
the cancer diagnosis in both analyses. All models were adjusted for
baseline values of established risk factors for breast cancer, such as
parity (entered as two variables; the categorical variable parous/
nulliparous and the quantitative variable number of births); age at
ﬁrst birth; previous benign breast tumor surgery (yes/no); length of
school education (low, medium, high); use of HRT (never, former,
current); duration of HRT; BMI; and alcohol intake. Two-sided 95%
CI for the incidence rate ratio (IRR) were calculated based on Wald’s
test of the Cox regression parameter, i.e., on the log rate ratio scale.
The procedure PHREG in SAS (release 6.12; SAS Institute, Cary,
NC) on a Unix platform, was used for statistical analyses.

All quantitative variables were entered linearly in the Cox model.
This is biologically more reasonable than the step functions corre-
sponding to categorization; furthermore, it increases the power of the
analyses (44). The hypothesis of a linear association was evaluated
using a linear spline with three boundaries as covariates in the Cox
model (45). For the continuous variables, the three boundaries were
placed at the quartile cut points of ﬁsh intake among cases (see Table

2 for placement of boundaries). The linearity was evaluated graphi-
cally as well as by a numerical test using the likelihood ratio test
statistic to compare the model assuming linearity with the linear
spline model. We found no signiﬁcant departure from linearity.

In the analyses, ﬁsh intake was divided according to fat content
(lean ﬁsh with ⱕ8 g fat/100 g ﬁsh and fatty ﬁsh with ⬎8 g fat/100 g
ﬁsh) and preparation method [fried (8 different questions), boiled (5
different questions) and processed ﬁsh (11 different questions)]. Pro-
cessed ﬁsh was considered a separate group because this type of
preparation differs from the two others by including ﬁsh prepared by
other methods, e.g., pickling, salting and smoking. In the analysis
comparing intake of fatty and lean ﬁsh (Table 2), women with intake
of only one type were excluded. Total energy intake was evaluated in
all models, but did not inﬂuence the estimates, and thus was not
included in the ﬁnal model.

RESULTS

The median age at entry for the 23,693 postmenopausal
women included was 57 y (range, 50 – 65 y). The median
length of follow-up was 4.8 y (1st-99th percentiles: 1.1– 6.8),
during which time 424 cases of a primary breast cancer were
diagnosed. Information about ER status of the tumors was
obtained for 394 (93%) cases of breast cancer. Of these, 303
(77%) tumors were reported to be ER⫹ and 91 (23%) tumors
ER⫺. For the remaining 30 tumors, it was not possible to
determine ER status on 10 in situ tumors; the remaining 20
tumors could not be located in the register.

The ﬁsh intake varied between 11 and 86 g (5th and 95th
percentiles) for the total cohort with a higher intake of lean
ﬁsh than fat ﬁsh. Most of the ﬁsh were fried, fresh ﬁsh or

processed, but intake of boiled ﬁsh was relatively low (Table
1). The associations between confounding variables and the
breast cancer incidence were all in the expected directions.
That is, the incidence rates decreased with number of chil-
dren, but increased with increasing values of age at ﬁrst birth,
use of HRT, duration of HRT use, length of education, intake
of alcohol and history of benign breast tumor surgery.

Total ﬁsh intake was associated with a signiﬁcant increase
in the breast cancer incidence rate per 25 g daily intake [IRR
⫽ 1.13 (CI, 1.04 –1.22); Table 2]. Adjustment for established
risk factors did not change the result. To illustrate this rela-
tionship further, the total ﬁsh intake was divided according to
quartiles. When the upper quartile group was compared with
the lower quartile group, there was an increase of 47% in the
incidence rate of breast cancer. To explore whether the ele-
vated IRR was related to the fat content, we divided the ﬁsh
intake according to fat content. This resulted in IRR of 1.11
(CI, 0.91–1.34) for fatty ﬁsh and 1.13 (CI, 0.99 –1.29) for lean
ﬁsh, both per 25 g mean daily intake. Analyzing ﬁsh intake
according to the three different types of preparation method
gave almost identical IRR when adjusted for established risk
factors. These results indicate that high total ﬁsh intake rather
than fat content or preparation method is associated with an
increased incidence of breast cancer.

High total ﬁsh intake was associated with a signiﬁcantly
increased incidence rate of ER⫹ breast cancer with an IRR of
1.14 (CI, 1.03–1.25) per mean intake of 25g/d. For ER⫺ breast
cancer, no association was present, i.e., IRR ⫽ 1.01 (CI,
0.83–1.24). Adjustment for established risk factors did not
change the result (Table 3).

DISCUSSION

This prospective study found that higher intakes of ﬁsh
were associated with higher incidence rates of breast cancer.
The association was independent of fat content and prepara-

tion method of the ﬁsh. The incidence of ER⫹ tumors was
increased for higher intakes of ﬁsh, whereas no increase was
seen for ER⫺ tumors.

Our study has several strengths. The FFQ used in this study
had 24 speciﬁc questions on ﬁsh, making this study very
comprehensive on this relationship, and providing the possi-
bility of studying the speciﬁc associations with ﬁsh according
to fat content or preparation method. Our FFQ was validated
(38). Also, a biomarker study comparing fatty acid proﬁles in
adipose tissue biopsies with dietary intake was carried out and
showed correlations between the ﬁsh PUFA measured in the
adipose tissue and in the FFQ of 0.58 for EPA and 0.49 for
DHA (41). The correlations for these speciﬁc fatty acids were
higher compared with other types of fatty acids, and compa-
rable to results from other studies (46). Danish women have
the third highest mean intake of ﬁsh among European popu-
lations participating in the European Prospective Investigation
into Cancer and Nutrition study, and the second highest mean
intake of fatty ﬁsh (47). Together with a high interindividual
variation in ﬁsh intake, it provides a unique opportunity to
study the signiﬁcance of different types of ﬁsh, including fat
content and preparation methods.

Because the data were collected in a prospective design,
differential recall for cases is highly unlikely. Follow-up rate
was nearly complete (99.8%). Adjustment for known risk
factors changed the estimates only slightly; thus, it is not likely
that residual confounding from those factors affected the esti-
mates considerably.

To our knowledge, no prospective study has examined the
signiﬁcance of fat content in ﬁsh in relation to development of
breast cancer. If the protective effect of ﬁsh PUFA shown in
experimental models could be applied to humans, we would
expect a protective effect most pronounced for fatty ﬁsh,
which was not the case in our study. Another hypothesis is
that ﬁsh might be contaminated with substances present in the
environment, such as heavy metals and pesticides, which may
have estrogenic effects. Because these agents accumulate in fat
tissue, one would expect the elevated risk to be more pro-
nounced with higher intakes of fatty ﬁsh compared with lean
ﬁsh, which was not the case in our study. The inﬂuence of
pesticides on breast cancer risk was evaluated in a recent
review of human epidemiologic studies (48). Studies on the
organochlorine pesticides dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane
(DDT) and dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE) did not
ﬁnd that these pesticides predict breast cancer risk in Cauca-
sian Western women. For another persistent organochlorine
pesticide, dieldrin, a relationship was found in Danish but not
in American women, with a doubling of the breast cancer risk

3668

STRIPP ET AL.

for women in the highest quartile group compared with
women in the lowest quartile group (49,50). The concentra-
tions of dieldrin were comparable in the two studies.

There are considerable discrepancies between the results
from experimental studies and epidemiologic studies, with
experimental studies exclusively showing a preventive effect of
ﬁsh oil on the development and progression of breast cancer.
The epidemiologic literature has not shown similar results,
when excluding the ecologic studies. An explanation of this
discrepancy could be that the ﬁsh oils and fatty acids used in
experimental models differ from those eaten by humans, e.g.,
with regard to content of contaminating substances. If this is
true, there might be a true beneﬁcial effect of ﬁsh PUFA but
it might be obscured by opposite effects of other substances
found in the ﬁsh being eaten.

If the association between ﬁsh intake and breast cancer
incidence was caused by the fat content of the ﬁsh, then a
higher rate ratio per 25 g ﬁsh should be seen for the fat ﬁsh
types. Thus, the almost identical estimates for fat ﬁsh and lean
ﬁsh indicate that the associations may be caused by other
substances that are present in equal amounts in fat ﬁsh and
lean ﬁsh. Although a recent study (51) showed that associa-
tions with dietary fat in general may be underestimated be-
cause of imprecise measurement methods, this is not applica-
ble for
study because there is very little
measurement uncertainty on the type of ﬁsh.

the present

Cooking at high temperatures has been shown to form
carcinogenic substances such as heterocyclic amines (HA) in
both animal and in vitro studies; several studies have investi-
gated how preparation methods of meat and ﬁsh affect breast
cancer risk. A prospective study with extensive information on
preparation practices found an almost ﬁve times higher risk of
breast cancer among women who consumed overcooked meats
than among women who consumed rare- or medium-cooked
meats (52). Whether this result is applicable to ﬁsh is not
clear, but it has been hypothesized that the HA content might
be even higher in well-done ﬁsh than in other meats (53).
Only one study reported on the speciﬁc relationship of ﬁsh
preparation and breast cancer risk, ﬁnding an inverse relation
with the frequency of main meals containing ﬁsh in poached
form (54). In our study, we did not ﬁnd any association with
preparation method. Our questionnaire distinguished among
preparation methods by separate questions on fried, boiled and
processed ﬁsh, and also questions on the appearance of the
surface of prepared meat, including ﬁsh, at four different levels.
There were no differences between cases and the cohort in
answers to the questions on doneness; however, our questions
might have been too unspeciﬁc to explain the degree of
exposure to HA, and factors other than the exposure itself
might be of importance. The risk of breast cancer has been
evaluated according to differential sensitivity toward HA, due
to genetic variations; one study reported that exposure to HA
may be a risk factor only among women with the high acety-
lating N-acetyltransferase 2 polymorphism (55).

To our knowledge, only one epidemiologic study previously
examined the relationship between ﬁsh intake and breast
cancer risk according to ER status of the breast cancer tissue
(32). This case-control study had results similar to ours. The
present study found no association for ER⫺ tumors but with
wide conﬁdence limits leaving the possibilities of adverse or
protective effect of ﬁsh intake on ER⫺ tumors.

Because this is the ﬁrst prospective study analyzing the
association between dietary ﬁsh intake and ER status–speciﬁc
breast cancer, the results have to be interpreted with caution,
especially because the number of ER⫺ tumors was relatively
small. In a review on pesticides and breast cancer, it was noted

that out of several studies investigating the relation of ER
status of breast tumors to body burdens of DDT or DDE, only
one found a relationship between receptor status and tissue
levels of DDE, showing that women with ER⫹ breast tumors
had substantially higher concentrations of DDE in breast ad-
ipose tissue than women with ER⫺ breast tumors; the other
studies found no relationship (56).

Because the estimated associations for fat ﬁsh and lean ﬁsh
are almost identical, even very narrow conﬁdence limits would
lead to the same conclusion; thus, lack of statistical power of
the study cannot explain the lack of difference between the
two associations. Similarly, the estimated incidence rate ratio
for ER⫺ tumors per 25 g average daily intake of ﬁsh was very
close to one, indicating that lack of statistical power in itself
cannot explain the null result.

The present study indicates that the observed association
between ﬁsh intake and incident breast cancer among post-
menopausal women cannot be ascribed to the fat content.
Furthermore, the adverse effect of ﬁsh intake was observed for
ER⫹ tumors only. Further studies are warranted to examine
which other substances in ﬁsh or other risk factors related to
ﬁsh intake may explain the observed association for ER⫹
tumors, and to evaluate a possible difference in the association
for ER⫹ breast cancer and ER⫺ breast cancer.
