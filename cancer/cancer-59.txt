ABSTRACT Overexpression of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2/neu) characterizes a molecular
subtype of breast cancer associated with poor clinical outcome. Preventive strategies for HER-2/neu–positive
breast cancer, which is often estrogen and progesterone receptor negative, remain undeﬁned. Activators of
peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ␥ (PPAR␥), a nuclear hormone receptor also expressed in breast
cancer, hold potential as cancer prevention agents. PPAR␥ ligands include speciﬁc fatty acids and synthetic
compounds, such as the thiazolidinediones, which appear to inhibit cell proliferation and tumorigenesis. We
hypothesized that a thiazolidinedione, rosiglitazone, may serve as a chemopreventive agent for HER-2/neu-
associated mammary carcinogenesis, but that efﬁcacy may be inﬂuenced by dietary fat content. We studied the
effects of diets enriched with corn or ﬁsh oil (25% of energy) with and without rosiglitazone (12 g/kg) in a 2 ⫻ 2
factorial design on mammary tumorigenesis in murine mammary tumor virus (MMTV)-HER-2/neu transgenic mice.
Despite in vitro evidence of antiproliferative effects in an MMTV-HER-2/neu tumor cell line, rosiglitazone did not
affect mammary carcinogenesis in vivo. Interestingly, ﬁsh oil– based diets markedly suppressed breast tumor
incidence (57% of mice vs. 87% of corn oil–fed mice, P ⫽ 0.0001) as well as tumor multiplicity (P ⫽ 0.001) and
mammary gland dysplasia (P ⫽ 0.001). These ﬁndings demonstrate a potent preventive effect of (n-3) PUFA on
HER-2/neu–mediated mammary carcinogenesis, without interaction with a synthetic PPAR␥ activator. Further
studies focusing on the mechanisms by which (n-3) fatty acids suppress HER-2/neu signaling pathways involved
in the pathogenesis of breast cancer are warranted.

The role of dietary fat concentration and source in breast
carcinogenesis remains speculative. Evidence suggesting that
the type of dietary fat, such as the fatty acid proﬁle, may
inﬂuence breast cancer cell biology or mammary carcinogen-
esis was derived from in vitro and rodent studies, respectively.
In general, cell culture and animal studies point to the stim-
ulatory effect of linoleic acid (LA),3 an (n-6) PUFA, on tumor
cell growth in contrast to the inhibitory effects of (n-3) fatty
acids such as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapenta-
enoic acid (EPA) (1–3). In vitro experiments demonstrated
increased proliferation of breast cancer cells as well as normal
human mammary epithelial cells in the presence of LA (4,5).
Unlike the tumor-enhancing effects of diets containing ele-
vated amounts of LA, diets enriched with the (n-3) fatty acids
EPA and DHA suppress both tumor growth and metastasis in

(6 – 8).

One potential mediator of the effects of speciﬁc fatty acids
and fatty acid metabolites on mammary tumorigenesis is per-
oxisome proliferator-activated receptor ␥ (PPAR␥), a ligand-
activated transcription factor expressed in normal and malig-
nant mammary epithelial cells (9 –13). PPAR␥is a member of
the steroid nuclear hormone receptor superfamily, with several
putative natural ligands, including speciﬁc fatty acids and
eicosanoids, as well as synthetic activators (14 –16). Fatty acid
derivatives such as 15-deoxy-⌬12,14-prostaglandin J2 (15d-
PGJ2) and 13- and 9-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid were also
identiﬁed as PPAR␥ ligands (17,18). Furthermore, PPAR␥
plays a key role in adipocyte differentiation and fat metabolism
(19,20).

Much of what is known about PPAR␥ was derived from
studies with synthetic compounds that activate PPAR␥, such
as the thiazolidinediones, a widely used class of oral hypogly-
cemic drugs (21). Rosiglitazone (Avandia®, GlaxoSmithK-
line) and pioglitazone (Actos™, Takeda Chemical Industry)
are thiazolidinediones currently utilized for the treatment of
insulin-resistant diabetes mellitus. Several studies indicate
that activators of PPAR␥ such as 15d-PGJ2 and thiazo-
lidinediones inhibit the proliferation of breast cancer cells in

vitro, which appears to involve cell cycle arrest and sensitiza-
tion to apoptosis (22,23). Thiazolidinedione treatment also
inhibited human breast cancer xenograft growth in immuno-
suppressed mice (11) and impaired the in vitro development of
preinvasive mammary lesions in mouse mammary gland organ
cultures treated with the carcinogen 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]an-
thracene (24). Administration of a synthetic ligand for
PPAR␥, GW7845, signiﬁcantly inhibited nitrosomethylurea-
induced mammary cancer in rats (25). These studies suggest
that PPAR␥ligands, either synthetic or derived from fatty acid
metabolites, may inhibit breast tumor development and pro-
gression.

Unique patterns of genetic aberration appear to account for
heterogeneity in disease progression and response to therapy.
One such genetic alteration is the ampliﬁcation of the human
epidermal growth factor receptor 2, HER-2/neu, which occurs
in 15– 40% of breast cancers (26) and portends a poorer
prognosis (27). Because tumors overexpressing HER-2/neu are
often resistant to hormone therapy, novel strategies are re-
quired for optimally preventing as well as treating this aggres-
sive molecular subtype of breast cancer.

Accordingly, this study explored the effects of 2 potentially
interacting variables that could target PPAR␥-mediated sig-
naling pathways during HER-2/neu-mediated mammary carci-
nogenesis. Using a 2 ⫻ 2 factorial design, we examined the
interactions between dietary fatty acid content [diets enriched
with (n-6) PUFAs vs. (n-3) PUFAs] and a pharmacologic
PPAR␥ligand (presence or absence of rosiglitazone) on breast
carcinogenesis in mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV)-
HER-2/neu transgenic mice.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Mouse experimental procedure. Animal care and use were in
accord with institution guidelines and approved by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee of The Ohio State University.
Virgin female FVB/N-TgN(MMTVneu)202Mul transgenic mice (28)
were obtained from Jackson Laboratory and housed in groups of up to
5 in plastic shoebox cages with autoclaved bedding and ﬁltered air,
with 12 h of darkness daily and an ambient air temperature of 22
⫾ 2°C. Mice had free access to diet and water. Mice were individually
tagged and randomly distributed into 4 (n ⫽ 15 per group) diet/
treatment groups representing a balanced 2 ⫻ 2 factorial design (ﬁsh
oil vs. corn oil and drug vs. no drug). Mice in groups were balanced
for age at the time of initiation of experimental diets at 7– 8 wk of age.
Diets were replenished daily, with removal of uneaten pellets and
daily monitoring of food intake. The health of the mice was moni-
tored daily, and mice were weighed and inspected for palpable mam-
mary tumors 1–2 times/wk. Two perpendicular diameters were mea-
sured weekly once a tumor appeared. Mice were killed by cervical
dislocation when tumors reached 1.5–2.0 cm in greatest diameter or
at 15 mo of age. Mammary glands were harvested and ﬁxed in 10%
buffered formalin for parafﬁn-embedding. Tumor histopathology was
conﬁrmed by evaluation of hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained
sections.

H&E-stained sections of mammary glands were evaluated without
knowledge of diet groups for mammary gland proliferative lesions
based on the consensus report from the 1999 Annapolis meeting on
mammary gland pathology of genetically engineered mice (29). Mam-
mary gland atypical ductular hyperplasia was graded on a scale of
minimal, mild, mild-moderate, moderate, and marked, based on the
percentage of the mammary gland affected, the thickness of the
proliferating ductular epithelium, and cellular atypia (high nuclear to
cytoplasmic ratio, cytoplasmic basophilia, cytomegaly, karyomegaly,
and cellular and nuclear pleomorphism). One representative nontu-
mor-bearing gland was examined for each mouse evaluated.

Diets. AIN-93G-based diets (30) were prepared by Research
Diets, with either 24.75% of energy as corn oil or 22.50% of energy
as menhaden (ﬁsh) oil plus 2.25% of energy as corn oil, with or

without rosiglitazone maleate (Glaxo SmithKline) at 12 mg rosigli-
tazone/kg of diet. This concentration of rosiglitazone was utilized
previously in FVB/N mice to achieve ⬃3 mg/(kg 䡠 d) (31). The 25%
of energy as fat was selected for a diet of moderate fat content without
consequential imbalance in carbohydrate and protein content rela-
tive to nonpuriﬁed diets, with corn oil as a source of (n-6) PUFA and
ﬁsh oil as a source of (n-3) PUFA. To accommodate the modiﬁcation
of fat content of the AIN-93G diet from 16 to 25% of energy, the
carbohydrate content was decreased to 55% of energy; t-butylhydro-
quinone at 0.23 g/kg and vitamin E acetate (Sigma) at 17.4 mg/kg
were added for stabilization of the menhaden oil. The diets met the
recommended dietary linoleate requirements for mice of 0.68% of
energy, and mice were monitored for signs of essential fatty acid
deﬁciency (32). The menhaden oil diets contained 2.1% of energy as
LA, and the corn oil diets contained 14.9% of energy as LA. Diets
were handled under low light conditions and stored at ⫺20°C.

Cell culture. The NT5 cell line (kind gift of Dr. R. Todd Reilly,
Johns Hopkins University) was maintained in Iscove’s Modiﬁed Dul-

the numbers of tumors in treatment groups were made using the
nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test with pairwise comparisons using
Bonferroni adjustment. Time to the development of palpable lesions
was deﬁned as the period from the initiation of treatment [at 7– 8 wk
of age] to the development of palpable lesions. Univariate compari-
sons of time-dependent data were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier plots
with logrank tests. In a multivariate setting of drug, diet, and an
interaction term of drug ⫻ diet, time to detection of palpable tumor
was analyzed using Cox proportional hazards regression. The sample
size of 15 mice/treatment group was chosen to allow detection of
hazard ratios ⱖ 4 with a power of 0.80 and 2-sided ␣ of 0.05.
Differences were considered signiﬁcant at P ⬍ 0.05.

RESULTS

Antiproliferative effects of PPAR␥ligands on HER-2/neu
transgenic mammary tumor cells. The NT5 cell line was
derived from an FVB/N-TgN(MMTVneu)202Mul transgenic
mouse mammary tumor (34). NT5 cells expressed PPAR␥
protein (Fig. 1A). By immunostaining, PPAR␥expression was
also demonstrated in formalin-ﬁxed NT5 cells and MMTV-
HER-2/neu mouse mammary tumor specimens (data not
shown). Although hormones such as progesterone or dihy-
drotestosterone can stimulate the MMTV promoter (35),
HER-2/neu receptor expression and phosphorylation in NT5
cells were not signiﬁcantly altered by PPAR␥ligand treatment
(Fig. 1B, C). However, the PPAR␥ activator, rosiglitazone,
inhibited the proliferation of NT5 cells (Fig. 1D).

PGJ2 (Cayman Chemical, Alexis Biochemicals) in IMDM with 10%
charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum.

Immunoblotting. Total protein extraction, SDS-PAGE fraction-

HER-2 (Upstate), phosphotyrosine (Cell Signaling Technology), and
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) (Chemicon).

Neither dietary fat nor drug content signiﬁcantly altered food
consumption or weight gain (P ⬎ 0.05, data not shown). Mice
fed the drug-containing diets consumed ⬃1.2 mg rosiglitazone/
(kg 䡠 d).

Dietary ﬁsh oil inhibits mammary tumor incidence. Of
60 mice, 72% (43/60) developed palpable mammary tumors.
Five of the 17 mice without clinically detectable tumors were
euthanized due to illness, and necropsy revealed 2 uterine
tumors (ﬁsh oil, corn oil ⫹ drug), 1 lung tumor (ﬁsh oil), 1
anal tumor (ﬁsh oil ⫹ drug), and lymphoma (corn oil). These
extra-mammary tumors were histologically distinct from the
mammary tumors and not representative of metastases.

Compared with the corn oil diets, dietary ﬁsh oil increased
the latency time to mammary gland tumor development in the
HER-2/neu transgenic mice (logrank P ⫽ 0.0001) (Fig. 2A);
57% (17/30) of the mice fed ﬁsh oil diets and 87% (26/30) of
mice fed corn oil diets developed clinically overt mammary
tumors. Thus, relative to the corn oil-based diets, dietary ﬁsh
oil suppressed mammary tumorigenesis by 30% (P ⫽ 0.02).

Rosiglitazone did not affect mammary tumor incidence at
15 mo (logrank P ⫽ 0.22) (Fig. 2B). In the multivariate Cox
model, the drug ⫻ diet interaction term was not signiﬁcant (P
⫽ 0.50), whereas diet was signiﬁcant (P ⫽ 0.019) and drug
treatment was not (P ⫽ 0.053).

Dietary ﬁsh oil

inhibits mammary tumor multiplicity.
Tumor multiplicity differed between diet groups as well, with
more palpable mammary tumors per mouse developing in those
fed corn oil than in those fed ﬁsh oil (P ⫽ 0.001) (Table 1).

Dietary ﬁsh oil also suppressed the number of mammary
tumors as determined by gross identiﬁcation at necropsy, when
additional macroscopic tumors were detected (P ⬍ 0.001), and
by microscopic identiﬁcation of microtumor nodules ⱖ 0.5
mm in H&E stained sections of whole mammary glands (P
⬍ 0.001). Rosiglitazone did not affect tumor multiplicity by
palpation (P ⫽ 0.40), detection at necropsy (P ⫽ 0.40), or
enumeration of microscopic tumor nodules per gland (P
⫽ 1.0).

Fish oil consumption is associated with lower-grade mam-
mary gland histopathology.
Pathologic review of H&E
stained sections of mammary glands identiﬁed atypical ductal
hyperplasia in all cases (Fig. 3). Of the 58 mice with mammary
glands available for evaluation, the degree of mammary gland
dysplasia differed between the diet groups (P ⫽ 0.001). Mam-

mary glands with less pronounced atypical ductal hyperplasia
(i.e., minimal and mild) occurred more frequently in mice fed
ﬁsh oil, representing 73% (11/15) of ﬁsh oil and 87% (13/15)
of ﬁsh oil ⫹ drug groups compared with 62% (8/13) of corn oil
and 20% (3/15) of corn oil ⫹ drug groups. In order of decreas-
ing frequency, we observed atypia of a higher grade (i.e.,
mild-moderate, moderate, and marked) in 80% (12/15) of corn
oil ⫹ drug, 38% (5/13) of corn oil, 27% (4/15) of ﬁsh oil and
13% (2/15) of ﬁsh oil ⫹ drug-fed mice. The only instances of
marked atypia occurred in 2 mice consuming the corn oil ⫹
drug diet. The degree of atypical ductal hyperplasia in mam-
mary tissue was associated with dietary fat content (P ⫽ 0.001)
although not for drug (P ⫽ 0.22), with a signiﬁcant association
of corn oil– enriched diets with atypia of increasing severity.

DISCUSSION

This study demonstrated a marked effect of dietary fat
composition on HER-2/neu-mediated mammary tumorigene-
sis. Enriched with (n-3) PUFAs, the ﬁsh oil signiﬁcantly
suppressed mammary tumor development compared with the
corn oil– based diets. Despite prior reports of the preventive
beneﬁts of EPA, DHA, and ﬁsh oil in carcinogen-induced and
transplantable breast tumor development, to our knowledge,
this is the ﬁrst report of breast cancer prevention in a trans-
genic model of mammary tumorigenesis by solely modulating
dietary fat composition. Our data indicate a potent effect of
ﬁsh oil in prolonging tumor latency and reducing tumor mul-
tiplicity in HER-2/neu overexpression-positive, estrogen re-
ceptor–negative breast cancer. Most interestingly, the lack of
effect of rosiglitazone suggests that the inﬂuence of dietary
fatty acid composition may be independent of PPAR␥ activa-
tion.

The mechanisms by which the type of dietary fat inﬂuences
mammary carcinogenesis are likely complex, with effects at
various stages of this multistep process, as summarized in
recent reviews (36,37). PUFAs may modulate diverse biologic
processes, including lipid peroxidation, eicosanoid production,
growth factor receptor function at the cell membrane level,
and signal transduction pathways affecting cell proliferation
and survival (2,38,39). Whether (n-3) PUFAs speciﬁcally
target pathways critical to HER-2/neu-mediated signaling,
such as those of mitogen-activated protein kinase and phos-
phoinositide 3-kinase (40,41), merits further investigation as

well. Indeed, certain molecular, genetic subtypes of breast
cancer might exhibit greater susceptibility to the effects of
dietary fat content.

Despite the lack of main effects of a synthetic PPAR␥
ligand or interactions with dietary fat composition, the possi-
bility of a mediating role for PPAR␥ cannot be eliminated
completely. Perhaps additional studies are required with vari-
ous PPAR␥ ligands administered over a larger dose range. For
example, the inhibitory effects of rosiglitazone in vitro oc-
curred at doses higher than those likely attained under the
conditions of our dietary study. Importantly, although rosigli-
tazone did not affect HER-2/neu-mediated breast cancer, the
corn oil ⫹ rosiglitazone combination tended to induce greater
mammary gland atypia relative to corn oil alone (P ⫽ 0.051).
Our in vitro ﬁndings in MMTV-HER-2/neu breast cancer cells
did not indicate that this potential stimulatory effect resulted
from activation of the MMTV promoter by the PPAR␥ligand.
Rosiglitazone possibly elicits a differential response of gene
expression patterns at different doses or has nonlinear dose
effects. Results of in vitro studies indicated that low, rather
than high concentrations of PPAR␥ ligands could have such
differential effects (42,43). Certainly, further studies with the
drug given over a larger dose range and increased numbers of
mice to enhance statistical power would help resolve these
issues. Interestingly, paradoxical stimulation of colon tumori-
genesis by treatment with PPAR␥ ligands was observed in
some models of colon carcinogenesis (44,45). A recent study
also demonstrated that mammary-speciﬁc expression of acti-
vated PPAR␥ in transgenic MMTV-VpPPAR␥ mice stimu-
lates tumorigenesis in mammary tissue that is cancer prone
(i.e., MMTV-PyV transgenic mice expressing polyoma virus
middle T antigen in the mammary gland) but not in tissue
from mice with a normal background (46). These reports and
our own ﬁndings underscore the importance of additional
efforts in a variety of models of cancer to understand the
molecular, biochemical, and cellular context of PPAR␥ sig-
naling.

An in vitro study indicated that PPAR␥ ligands could
inhibit neuregulin-mediated activation of HER-2/neu in
MCF-7 breast cancer cells (47). However, we did not observe
alterations in HER-2/neu expression or phosphorylation in
NT5 cells with different PPAR␥activators. Whether this lack
of suppression relates to this speciﬁc model of HER-2/neu
overexpression, both in vitro and in vivo, requires further
evaluation. A recent report also suggested that HER-2/neu
overexpression in MCF-7 breast cancer cells upregulated
PPAR␥ expression while inhibiting PPAR␥ ligand activation
(48). Thus, additional studies are warranted to investigate the
inhibitory interactions between PPAR␥ and
possibility of
HER-2/neu signaling pathways.

Taken together, our data demonstrate the strong suppres-

addition of
rosiglitazone did not alter the main effects of the (n-3) and

Because HER-2/neu overexpression represents an important
subtype of human breast cancer with particular aggressiveness,
our ﬁndings of the protective beneﬁts of diets rich in (n-3)
fatty acids in experimental HER-2/neu–mediated breast carci-
nogenesis establish a foundation for future clinical studies.
Indeed, the role of (n-3) fatty acid intake in the etiology of
HER-2/neu positive breast cancer as well as in support of
established adjuvant therapy in women with HER-2/neu breast
cancer should be considered
