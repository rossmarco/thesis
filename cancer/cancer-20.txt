Abstract

Folate metabolism supports the synthesis of nucleotides as
well as the transfer of methyl groups. Polymorphisms
in folate-metabolizing enzymes have been shown to affect
risk of colorectal neoplasia and other malignancies. Using
data from a population-based incident case-control study
(1,600 cases and 1,962 controls), we investigated associations
between genetic variants in the reduced folate carrier (RFC),
thymidylate synthase (TS), methionine synthase (MTR),
and 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) and
colon cancer risk. The TS enhancer region (TSER) variant
was associated with a reduced risk among men [2rpt/2rpt
versus 3rpt/3rpt wild-type; odds ratio (OR), 0.7; 95%
confidence interval, 0.6-0.98] but not women. When com-
bined genotypes for both TS polymorphisms (TSER and
3V-untranslated region 1494delTTAAAG) were evaluated,
ORs for variant genotypes were generally below 1.0, with
statistically significantly reduced risks among women.

Neither MTR D919G nor RFC 80G>A polymorphisms were
associated with altered colon cancer risk. Because folate
metabolism is characterized by interrelated reactions, we
evaluated gene-gene interactions. Genotypes resulting in
reduced MTHFR activity in conjunction with low TS
expression were associated with a reduced risk of colon
cancer. When dietary intakes were taken into account,
individuals with at least one variant TSER allele (3rpt/2rpt
or 2rpt/2rpt) were at reduced risk in the presence of a low
folate intake. This study supports findings from adenoma
studies indicating that purine synthesis may be a relevant
biological mechanism linking folate metabolism to colon
cancer risk. A pathway-based approach to data analysis is
needed to help discern the independent and combined
effects of dietary intakes and genetic variability in folate
(Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev 2005;
metabolism.

Introduction

Folate is an essential micronutrient in humans, the primary
function of which is as a carrier of single-carbon units. Folate-
dependent reactions include the biosynthesis of thymidylate,
purines, methionine, and glycine thus linking it to nucleotide
synthesis as well as the provision of methyl groups (1).
High dietary folate intakes, or biomarkers thereof, have
been associated with a reduced risk of colon cancer or its pre-
cursors in most, although not all, studies (2-5). Several studies
showing associations with genetic polymorphisms in folate-
metabolizing enzymes lend support to a causal relationship
between folate and colorectal carcinogenesis (6-10). Biological
mechanisms linking folate to colorectal carcinogenesis include
an altered provision of S-adenosylmethionine for methylation
reactions, including DNA methylation, and changes in the
availability of nucleotides, such as thymidylate, for DNA
synthesis and repair (11, 12).

We have previously reported on associations between
polymorphisms in 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase
(MTHFR) and risk of colon cancer (13). Here, we extend this
work to common genetic variants in thymidylate synthase
(TS), the reduced folate carrier (RFC), and methionine synthase
(MTR) in relation to colon cancer risk. TS is a key enzyme in
folate metabolism that catalyzes the conversion of dUMP to
dTMP for the provision of thymidine, a rate-limiting nucleo-

tide essential for DNA synthesis and repair (see Fig. 1). TS is
also a primary target for major chemotherapeutic agents,
including 5-fluorouracil. We investigated the role of a poly-
morphism in the 5V-untranslated region (5V-UTR) enhancer
region (three or two repeats of a 28-bp sequence), resulting in
reduced TS expression among those with fewer repeats (14)
and a 6-bp insertion or deletion (1,494 bp in the 3V-UTR) that
affects mRNA stability (15, 16).

RFC is responsible for the active transport of 5-methyl-
tetrahydrofolate from plasma to cytosol. A polymorphism in
the RFC gene (80G>A, Arg27His) seems associated with a
higher affinity for folate (17). Among 169 healthy individuals
who were stratified by MTHFR 677C>T genotype, the variant
A allele was consistently and linearly associated with higher
plasma folate concentrations (17). Furthermore, concentrations
of methotrexate 24 to 48 hours after administration were
higher among children with acute leukemia homozygous for
the variant A allele, providing additional support for differ-
ential carrier activity among those with variant genotypes (18).
MTR catalyzes the methylation of homocysteine to methi-
onine with simultaneous conversion of 5-methyl-tetrahydro-
folate to tetrahydrofolate (Fig. 1). A variant in the MTR gene
(2756A>G, Asp919Gly; ref. 19) may affect plasma homocysteine
concentrations. Some studies (20, 21) but not others (22-24)
have found that homocysteine concentrations tend to decrease
linearly across genotypes, with the AA genotype associated
with the highest homocysteine concentrations. Studies on
colorectal neoplasia have been inconsistent: the GG genotype
has been associated with a somewhat reduced risk of colo-
rectal cancer (22, 25) yet a possible increased risk of colorectal
adenoma (26).

In this large population-based case-control study of colon
cancer, we sought to evaluate the role of these polymorphisms
in defining colon cancer risk, either alone or in interaction with
specific nutrient intakes and other genotypes. Furthermore, as

some of the associations of folate metabolism may differ by
estrogen exposure (13), possibly because of mechanisms
attributable to hypermethylation of
the estrogen receptor
(27), we evaluated interactions with postmenopausal hormone
(PMH) use.

Materials and Methods

Participants were African American, Caucasian, or Hispanic
subjects from the Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Program of
Northern California, an eight-county area in Utah, and the
metropolitan Twin Cities area of Minnesota. Eligibility criteria
for cases included diagnosis with first-primary incident colon
cancer (International Classification of Diseases for Oncology, 2nd
edition codes 18.0, 18.2-18.9) between October 1, 1991 and
September 30, 1994; between 30 and 79 years of age at time of
diagnosis; and mentally competent to complete the interview.
Proximal tumors were defined as cecum through transverse
colon; tumors in the splenic flexure and descending and
sigmoid colon were categorized as distal. Cases with
adenocarcinoma or carcinoma of the rectosigmoid junction
or rectum (defined as the first 15 cm from the anal opening)
or with known familial adenomatous polyposis, ulcerative
colitis, or Crohn’s disease were not eligible. Of all cases
identified, 65% of those contacted consented to participate in
the study. Controls who had never had a previous colorectal
tumor were randomly selected in proportion to the cases
within the geographically defined areas from Kaiser Perma-
nente Medical Care Program membership lists in California;
driver’s license lists, random digit dialing, or Centers for
Medicare and Medicaid Services lists, formerly known as the
Health Care Finance Administration, for Utah; and driver’s

license or state identification lists in Minnesota. Controls were
frequency matched to cases by sex and 5-year age group.
These methods have been described in detail (28). Of all
controls selected, 64% participated.

Data Collection. Trained interviewers collected diet and
lifestyle data in person using laptop computers. Study quality
control methods have been described (29, 30). The reference
period for the study was the calendar year f2 years before
date of diagnosis (cases) or date of selection (controls). Dietary
intake data were ascertained using an adaptation of the valid-
ated Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults
diet history questionnaire (31). Participants were asked to
determine which foods were eaten and the frequency with
which foods were eaten. Nutrients were calculated using the
Minnesota Nutrition Coordinating Center’s nutrient database,
version 19.

TS, MTR, and RFC genotyping. Of 4,403 cases and controls
with valid study data, 3,680 (84%) had blood collected
primarily during the in-person interview, or during a clinical
visit (83% of cases and 85% of controls). Genomic DNA was
extracted using methods described in (refs. 14, 32). All samples
were genotyped for two polymorphisms in the TS gene (TSER,
3V-UTR 1494delTTAAAG), MTR D919G, and RFC 80G>A.
A total of 3,562 (97% of cases and 97% of controls with blood
collected) had genotype information for both TSER and 3V-UTR
1494delTTAAAG. 5V-Nuclease assays that had been previously
used to genotype other polymorphisms in the folate pathway
(MTHFR 677C>T, MTHFR 1298A>C, and MTR D919G) have
been described (13, 26).

Both TS polymorphisms were analyzed using fluorescent
the TSER 28-bp
size discrimination. For the analysis of
repeat polymorphism, a fragment containing the repeats was

6FAM-GTGGCTCCTGCGTTTCCCCC-3V; reverse primer, 5V-
GGCTCCGAGCCGGCCACAGGCATGGCGCGG-3V(14). The
PCR reactions contained 1 GeneAmp buffer (Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, CA), 1.5 mmol/L MgCl2, 200 Amol/
L deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates, 100 nmol/L each primer,
10% DMSO, 1 unit AmpliTaq DNA polymerase (Applied
Biosystems), and 100 ng of genomic DNA. Cycling conditions
were one cycle of 94jC for 2 minutes; 35 cycles of 94jC for
30 seconds, 63jC for 30 seconds, and 72jC for 30 seconds; and
a final extension at 72jC for 5 minutes. The amplified
fragments were analyzed on an ABI 3100 genetic analyzer.
A fragment containing the 3V-UTR deletion was amplified
forward primer, 5V-6FAM-
using the following primers:
CAAATCTGAGGGAGCTGAGT-3V; reverse primer, 5V-CAGA-
TAAGTGGCAGTACAGA-3V. The PCR reactions contained 1
GeneAmp buffer, 2 mmol/L MgCl2, 150 Amol/L deoxynucleo-
tide triphosphates, 300 nmol/L each primer, 1 unit AmpliTaq
DNA polymerase, and 50 ng genomic DNA. Cycling con-
ditions were one cycle of 94jC for 5 minutes; 30 cycles of 94jC
for 30 seconds, 60jC for 45 seconds, and 72jC for 60 seconds;
and a final extension at 72jC for 10 minutes. The amplified
fragments were analyzed on an ABI 3100 genetic analyzer. For
both TS polymorphisms, the correlation between fragment size
and repeat number was confirmed by sequencing.

The 80G>A polymorphism in RFC was detected by allelic
discrimination using the 5V nuclease assay on a 7900HT
sequence detection system (ABI). The 5V-nuclease genotyping
assay was validated by genotyping 100 individuals by both
5V-nuclease assay and RFLP. There were no discrepancies
between the two assays. Genotyping of the 80G>A polymor-
phism was done in 20-AL reactions containing 1 Taqman
PCR core reagents (ABI), 3 mmol/L MgCl2, 200 nmol/L
each PCR primer (forward primer, 5V-AGCCCAGCGGTGGA-
GAAG-3Vand reverse primer, 5V-AGCCGTAGAAGCAAAGG-
TAGCA-3V), 150 nmol/L MGB probe 5V-VIC-TCCTGGC-
GGCGCC-3V (Applied Biosystems; G allele), 100 nmol/L
MGB probe 5V-6-FAM-TGGCGGCACCTCG-3V (A allele), 0.5
unit AmpliTaq Gold, 0.2 unit AmpErase UNG, and 5 ng
genomic DNA. The amplification cycles were 50jC for
5 minutes, 95jC for 10 minutes, and 40 cycles of 95jC for
15 seconds and 60jC for 1 minute. Positive controls for all the
genotypes as well as four negative controls were included in
each plate. For quality control of all the polymorphisms,
genotyping for 94 randomly selected samples was repeated.
There were no discrepancies.

Statistical Methods. Logistic regression models were used
to estimate associations in various ways. We stratified the data
by sex and estimated the risk of colon cancer given a certain
TS, MTR, or RFC genotype and examined risk estimates
further stratified by other population characteristics (e.g.,
tumor site and age). The combined effects of TSER and 3V-
UTR 1494delTTAAAG were calculated using individuals who
were homozygous for the common allele at both loci as the
reference group. We assessed the joint interaction between
genotype and level of nutrient intake by using those with low
nutrient intake and homozygous for the most common (wild
type) allele for TSER, 3V-UTR, MTR, or RFC as a common
reference point. We also assessed gene-gene interactions in the
folate pathway using the homozygous genotype for the most
common allele as the reference. Similarly,
the interaction
between genotype and recent estrogen status in postmeno-
pausal women was assessed using as the reference group no
PMH use and wild-type TS, MTR, or RFC genotype.

Maximum likelihood estimates of population TS haplotype
frequencies from unphased genotype data were obtained from
an expectation maximization algorithm, assuming Hardy-
Weinberg equilibrium, according to Excoffier and Slatkin (33)
using SAS/Genetics software, 2002 (SAS/Genetics, Cary, NC).

Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI)
were calculated from unconditional logistic regression models.
In these models, age at diagnosis or selection, body mass index
reported for the reference period (kg/m2), long-term vigorous
leisure time physical activity, total energy intake, dietary fiber,
dietary calcium, and number of cigarettes smoked per day on a
regular basis were included as covariates to adjust for potential
confounding. Haplotype-specific relative risks were assessed
according to methods described in Stram et al. (34) using
logistic regression software (SAS, release 8.2).

Separate analyses were done for men and women to
determine whether differences existed by sex, as most of the
literature has focused on either men or women. Assessment of
interactions among genotypes, diet, and the risk of colon
cancer were based on departure from additive risks using the
relative risk due to interaction formulation of Hosmer and
Lemeshow extended to more than two allelic combinations
and/or environmental exposures (35). Interaction using a
multiplicative scale was also examined. Interactions between

Polymorphisms and Colon Cancer Risk

genotypes and PMH use in postmenopausal women were
m2 test of the difference between slopes
assessed using a Wald
from the (assumed linear) change in ORs, keeping the wild-
type TS genotype constant across the varying genotypes for
the respective other TS polymorphism.

Results

Selected characteristics of the study population and MTHFR
genotype frequencies by case or control status are presented in
Table 1. The study participants were predominantly self-
identified as non-Hispanic Caucasian (92%), with the remain-
der Hispanic (4%) and African American (4%). All genotypes
were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (assessed separately for
cases and controls), and allele frequencies were consistent with
previous reports (36). The TS polymorphisms were in linkage
disequilibrium (DV= 0.46 among non-Hispanic Caucasians).

Table 2 describes the main associations seen with the poly-
morphisms, stratified by gender. Among men, TSER variant
genotypes were associated with a significantly decreased risk
(3rpt/2rpt: OR, 0.8; 95% CI, 0.6-0.98; 2rpt/2rpt: OR, 0.7; 95%
CI, 0.6-0.98). No such risk reduction was observed among
women. When combined genotypes (or diplotypes) for both
TS polymorphisms were considered, almost all of the ORs for
variant genotypes among both men and women were below
1.0, with statistically significantly reduced risks for women.
Risk estimates for TS haplotypes, including variant alleles,
compared with wild-type haplotype were not significantly
different from 1.0 (data not shown).

Neither the MTR D919G nor RFC 80G>A polymorphism
was associated with altered colon cancer risk among men or
women (Table 2).

Folate metabolism involves circulation of folate metabolites
through multiple cycles, as well as feedback mechanisms
between these cycles (Fig. 1). Therefore, we evaluated gene-
gene interactions between the polymorphisms investigated
here, as well as those we have reported on previously (8, 13).
ORs different from 1.0 were seen largely for stratifications of
TS, RFC, or MTR by MTHFR 677C>T or 1298A>C genotypes,

and these are presented in Table 3. Among men, reduced
risks associated with variant TS genotypes (e.g., the presence
of TSER 2rpt/2rpt or TS 3V-UTR deletion) were most
pronounced for those with MTHFR TT genotypes. The
MTHFR 1298CC genotype was associated with a decreased
risk among women; however,
this risk reduction seemed
independent of TS genotypes. There was no evidence for
interactions between MTR D919G or RFC 80G>A and
MTHFR genotypes.

We also investigated whether risk estimates associated
with polymorphisms in these folate-metabolizing enzymes
differed by dietary intakes of folate, methionine, alcohol, or
vitamins B6, B2, or B12. Consistent with our previous report
on colorectal adenoma (37) among men, the TSER variant
conferred a reduced risk in the presence of low folate intake
(lowest tertile < 318 Ag/d; TS 2rpt/2rpt or 2rpt/3rpt: OR,
0.7; 95% CI, 0.5-0.9 compared with wild-type 3rpt/3rpt). A
similar risk reduction with the TSER variant genotypes
was observed among men with low methionine intakes (<2.0
g/d): TS 2rpt/2rpt or 2rpt/3rpt (OR, 0.6; 95% CI, 0.4-0.9)
compared with wild-type 3rpt/3rpt. However, none of these
patterns was observed among women for the TS genotypes
nor for TS haplotypes in either sex. There were no clear
patterns or associations following stratification by vitamin B6
or B12 intake. No meaningful differences in risk were
observed for MTR genotypes when stratified by nutrient
intakes.

Among women in the lowest tertile of folate intake (V273
Ag/d), the RFC variant genotypes were associated with a
decreased risk (wild-type GG: OR, 1.0; GA or AA: OR, 0.7; 95%
CI, 0.5-1.0). Among women, we observed a significant gene-
nutrient interaction in that only those with the GG genotype
benefited from a diet higher in folate, whereas no difference in
risk with variable folate intake was seen among those with the
combined GA or AA genotypes (P interaction = 0.04, multiplica-
tive scale; P = 0.01, additive scale). This pattern was not seen
among men.

Because of the observed differences in risk patterns among
men and women and our past findings regarding an inter-
action between postmenopausal hormone use (PMH use) and

NOTE: Adjusted for age, BMI, lifetime vigorous leisure activity, energy intake, dietary fiber, dietary calcium, usual number of cigarettes smoked, and other TS
polymorphisms where appropriate (TSER, TS 3VUTR). P interaction values of gene-gene associations were not statistically significant on an additive or multiplicative scale
(data not shown).

MTHFR genotype, we investigated whether risk estimates of
TS, MTR, or RFC genotypes differed by PMH use. Among
PMH users, the variant TS genotypes were associated with
substantially reduced risk of colon cancer, whereas much
weaker associations were observed among non-PMH users
(Table 4). No such interactions were observed for MTR or RFC
(data not shown).

Discussion

Within this large population-based study of colon cancer, we
investigated polymorphisms in three folate-metabolizing
enzymes (TS, MTR, and MTHFR), as well as the relevant
carrier protein (RFC), thus addressing genetic variability in
multiple key proteins in this biological pathway. There is
strong evidence for the functional effect of MTHFR 677C>T
and TSER variant genotypes (14, 38-41), with some, yet less
well defined, evidence for the in vivo functional relevance of
MTR, RFC, and the TS 3V-UTR variant (16-18, 20-23, 42). Our
evaluations of colon cancer risk confirm this assessment, in
that there were no significant alterations in risk for MTR,
RFC, and TS polymorphisms, with the exception of a risk
reduction associated with the TSER variants among men. The
ORs for TSER are comparable with those from a previous

report by Chen et al. (43) among male physicians (OR, 0.9;
95% CI, 0.6-1.3 for the 2rpt/3rpt genotype and OR, 0.6; 95%
CI, 0.4-0.98 for the 2rpt/2rpt genotype). A statistically
significant trend towards reduced risk with the variant TSER
alleles was observed both here and in that population (43).
the variant TSER 2rpt/2rpt
These results indicate that
genotype reduces risk of colon or colorectal cancer among
men to a degree comparable with that of the MTHFR 677TT
genotype (44). As risk reductions for TSER variants were only
seen among women who are on postmenopausal hormones
but not among women overall, estrogen status may play a
role.

Further complexity is added as a result of the presence of
a second functionally relevant polymorphism in TS (15, 16).
We evaluated the combined effects of these genotypes as well
as haplotypes to discern possible risk patterns. The combined
TS wild type/wild type genotype constitutes only 8.3% of our
population. When compared with this wild type/wild type
reference group of putatively highest TS expression and TS
mRNA stability, the variant TSER genotypes were associated
with statistically significantly reduced risk among women (OR,
0.6; 95% CI, 0.4-0.9) yet not among men. Our sample sizes for
these sex-specific associations were limited, and results should
be followed up in large study populations that have the ability
to investigate combined genotypes as well as sex-specific ORs.

The presence of two common functional variants within TS
suggests that it is essential to take both of these into account
simultaneously.

The MTR polymorphism is less common (allele frequency =
0.20) and has been investigated in three epidemiologic studies,
including a large Norwegian cohort (7, 25, 45). Similar to our
findings, Le Marchand et al. (45) and Chen et al. (7) did not
report any associations between this variant and colon cancer
risk, whereas Ulvik et al. (25) observed a significantly reduced
risk among those with a GG genotype compared with wild-
type AA (OR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.47-0.90). We observed reduced
risks among men (OR, 0.7), but the 95% CI included 1.0. As
only about 5% of the population have the homozygous variant
genotype, very large studies are needed to quantify the
strength of this association.

For gene-gene interactions, only combinations with the
MTHFR polymorphisms showed interesting patterns. This is
not surprising, because MTHFR is a key regulatory enzyme in
folate-mediated one-carbon metabolism, the activity of which
determines the distribution of
folate metabolites toward
nucleotide synthesis or methylation reactions. There is strong
evidence that the MTHFR 677C>T variant alters the balance of
metabolites within the pathway (39, 46). In combined analyses
of TS and MTHFR polymorphisms, we observed that men
carrying at least one variant TS allele (either TSER 2rpt or
TS 1494del) in addition to the MTHFR 677TT genotype were
at relatively lowest risk compared with all other groups (both
OR, 0.6; 95% CI, 0.4-0.9). This confirms our previous
observation in colorectal adenoma, where individuals with
low TS expression and low MTHFR activity genotypes also
experienced the lowest adenoma risk (OR, 0.56; ref. 10). If this
statistical interaction reflects biological mechanisms, then we
may hypothesize that the observed pattern suggests that a
greater diversion of
folate metabolites (specifically 5,10-
methylene-tetrahydrofolate) toward purine synthesis is pro-
tective for the development of colorectal neoplasia. Recent
findings by Quinlivan et al. suggest that folate depletion
adversely affects purine synthesis in humans and a greater
relative rate of adenine synthesis among individuals with the
MTHFR TT genotype (46). Depurination is the most common
type of DNA damage with f10,000 depurinations/cell/d
(47, 48). Although efficiently repaired, apurinic sites are
present in DNA. We recognize that one other study did not
observe this risk pattern, but their sample size was limited to
270 cases, with consequent restricted power for studying gene-
gene interactions (43).

Our investigations of gene-diet interactions confirmed, to
some extent, associations we have previously observed with
respect to TSER, and folate intake that reduced TS expression
(TSER 2rpt/2rpt) is associated with a reduced risk in the
presence of a low folate intake (10). However, this pattern was
seen only among men and also has not been observed in the

Health Professionals study (43). Again, if that pattern reflects a
biological mechanism, it would point toward purine synthesis
as a key link between one-carbon metabolism and colorectal
neoplasia. We were unable to confirm previously observed
gene-diet interactions for MTR in colorectal adenoma (26) and
did not see a clear pattern for RFC-diet interactions. However,
the RFC is the transporter for naturally occurring folates (in the
form of 5-methyl-tetrahydrofolate) but plays a smaller role in
the transport of folic acid (49). Thus, in populations, such as
the one described here, where folate intake from supplements
in the form of folic acid comprises a substantial proportion of
the overall folate intake, genetic variability in the RFC may not
be as relevant for the overall supply of folate metabolites.
Unfortunately, no quantitative information on supplement use
was available for this population.

Lastly, we observed differences in risk patterns dependent
on the past use of postmenopausal hormones. Interactions
between folate metabolism and PMH use are not implausible,
as there are links between homocysteine concentrations and
PMH use (50-53), and methylation of the estrogen receptor is
an early event in colorectal carcinogenesis, which may less
frequently occur in the presence of PMH (27, 54). We have
previously reported on a significant difference in risk patterns
of PMH-associated risks by MTHFR genotypes (13). However,
these interactions need to be confirmed by others, because
sample sizes were in parts insufficient to yield stable estimates.
Although this study is quite comprehensive with respect to
investigations of genetic variability in one-carbon metabolism
and risk of colon cancer, there are three important limitations.
First, our investigations did not include other genetic poly-
morphisms in folate-metabolizing enzymes that may be of
possible relevance, such as methionine-synthase reductase
(MTRR) or serine-hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT). Thus
far, MTRR does not seem related to colon cancer risk (45), and
the functional relevance of the cSHMT polymorphisms is
unclear. The study presented here focused on candidate
polymorphisms in key enzymes with substantial evidence for
functional effect; we hope to expand our investigations to other
relevant candidate polymorphisms as they are reported.

Second, there is now strong evidence that a subset of
colorectal cancer cases arises as part of a CpG island methylator
phenotype (55, 56). Information on CpG island methylator
phenotype status should be taken into account in future studies
investigating links between genetic variability in folate metab-
olism and risk of colorectal cancer.

A final

limitation is our current

inability to integrate
knowledge of biochemical relationships within the pathway
into the statistical analysis. Although an approach that uses
stratification for gene-nutrient or gene-gene interactions is
valuable, in that it allows for an empirical investigation of the
associations, it is also limited in that statistical power for
higher-order interactions is lacking, even within this large

study population. Because folate metabolism consists of
several interconnected cycles (see Fig. 1), such interactions
are to be expected. Our approach toward solving this problem
is to use, in the future, results from a mathematical model of
one-carbon biochemistry for investigations of multiple genetic
variants on selected biomarkers. Although this model is still
under development, preliminary results show that it replicates
the biochemical relationships in the folate cycle and methio-
nine cycle with reasonable accuracy (57, 58). Furthermore, our
group and others are developing methods to address this
key problem for molecular epidemiologic studies (59). Thus,
we hope that in the future, we will be able to achieve closer
integration of the biochemistry and statistical analysis. Because
there is strong evidence that disturbances in this biochemical
pathway can modify risk of several types of malignancies
(60-63), birth outcomes (64-66), and possibly cardiovascular
disease (67) and autism (68), a more thorough understanding
of the interplay of multiple genetic polymorphisms under
specific dietary conditions and their combined effect on bio-
markers and disease end points will be highly relevant.
