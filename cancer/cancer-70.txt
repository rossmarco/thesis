Abstract

Although experimental data suggest a potentially protective involvement of dietary ﬁber in prostate carcinogenesis, very

few prospective studies have investigated the relation between dietary ﬁber intake and prostate cancer risk, and those

have had inconsistent results. Our objective was to study the association between dietary ﬁber intake (overall, insoluble,

soluble, and from different sources, such as cereals, vegetables, fruits, and legumes) and prostate cancer risk.

Stratiﬁcations by excess weight status, insulin-like growth factors, and amount of alcohol intake were also considered.

This prospective analysis included 3313 men from the Suppl ´ementation en Vitamines et Min ´eraux Antioxydants (SU.VI.

MAX) cohort who completed at least 3 24-h dietary records. One hundred thirty-nine incident prostate cancers were

diagnosed between 1994 and 2007 (median follow-up of 12.6 y). Associations between quartiles of energy-adjusted

dietary ﬁber intake and prostate cancer risk were characterized by multivariate Cox proportional hazards models. Prostate

cancer risk was inversely associated with total dietary ﬁber intake (HR of quartile 4 vs. quartile 1 = 0.47; 95% CI: 0.27, 0.81;
P = 0.001), insoluble (HR = 0.46; 95% CI: 0.27, 0.78; P = 0.001), and legume (HR = 0.55; 95% CI: 0.32, 0.95; P = 0.04) ﬁber
intakes. In contrast, we found no association between prostate cancer risk and soluble (P = 0.1), cereal (P = 0.7), vegetable
(P = 0.9), and fruit (P = 0.4) ﬁber intakes. In conclusion, dietary ﬁber intake (total, insoluble, and from legumes but not soluble or

from cereals, vegetables, and fruits) was inversely associated with prostate cancer risk, consistent with mechanistic data. This

trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00272428. J. Nutr. 144: 504–510, 2014.

Introduction

Several mechanisms are involved in prostate cancer develop-
ment. First, experimental (1–3) and epidemiologic (3,4) data
suggest that chronic inﬂammation stimulates prostate carcino-
genesis. Second, insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia, which
lead to several metabolic modiﬁcations, such as higher insulin-
like growth factor (IGF)6-1 and IGF-2 bioactivity and lower sex-
hormone binding globulin (SHBG) concentrations (1,5,6), have

been associated with increased risk of prostate cancer in
experimental (5,7) and epidemiologic (7–11) studies. Finally,
increased concentrations of circulating estrogens and androgens
could be related to a greater risk of prostate cancer (12).

Experimental data suggested that dietary ﬁber may do the
following: 1) have anti-inﬂammatory properties (13–15); 2)
improve insulin sensitivity (16,17) and reduce IGF bioactivity,
notably by increasing insulin-like growth factor binding
protein (IGFBP) 3 concentrations (18); 3) upregulate SHBG
concentration (19); and 4) inﬂuence steroid hormone concen-
trations by decreasing circulating estrogens and androgens
(20,21), thereby supporting the hypothesis that dietary ﬁber
has a protective effect against prostate carcinogenesis.

In 2007, the World Cancer Research Fund (WCRF)/American
Institute for Cancer Research considered that the epidemiologic
evidence of an association between dietary ﬁber intake and
prostate cancer risk was too limited to allow a conclusion (22),
because only 1 unadjusted null-result prospective cohort study
was available (23). Since then, 3 prospective studies on dietary
ﬁber and prostate cancer risk have been published (24–26).
Overall, they did not detect any relation (24–26), except for an
inverse association observed in the European Prospective

Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) cohort study for
fruit ﬁber among men aged $65 y (26). However, these studies
(25,26) used FFQs to assess dietary ﬁber intakes, which may
weaken associations between food intakes and health outcomes
(27,28). Thus, new prospective studies are needed to further
investigate the relation between dietary ﬁber intake and prostate
cancer risk. In addition, ‘‘dietary ﬁber’’ refers to a large category
of molecules with various biochemical properties (such as
solubility) and fermentation products, probably resulting in
differential physiologic effects on the management of inﬂam-
mation, insulin resistance, or circulating steroid hormones and,
thus, prostate carcinogenesis (29,30). Nonetheless, only 1 pro-
spective study on prostate cancer risk has investigated separately
the different sources of dietary ﬁber (26), and none has
distinguished soluble and insoluble ﬁbers.

Furthermore, to our knowledge, previous prospective studies
on dietary ﬁber and prostate cancer risk did not take into
account IGF concentrations or stratify for alcohol intake, and
only 1 considered stratiﬁcation by BMI with null result (25).
Because overweight and obesity are linked to a low-grade
chronic inﬂammation status (2,6), IGF-1 and IGF-2 concentra-
tions are related to prostate cancer risk (7–10), and alcohol
intake is associated with higher concentrations of circulating
estrogens (31), we hypothesized that excess weight, IGF-1 and
IGF-2 concentrations, and alcohol intake may modulate the
association between dietary ﬁber intake and prostate cancer risk.
Hence, our objective was to prospectively investigate the
association between different types of dietary ﬁber (overall,
insoluble, soluble, and from different food sources, such as
cereals, vegetables, fruits, and legumes) and prostate cancer risk
using repeated dietary records, and explore its potential mod-
ulation by overweight/obesity status, IGF-1 and IGF-2 plasma
concentrations, and alcohol intake.

Materials and Methods

Participants. The Suppl´ementation en Vitamines et Min´eraux Anti-
oxydants (SU.VI.MAX) study was at ﬁrst designed as a randomized,
double-blind, placebo-controlled primary prevention trial (registered at
clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00272428) aiming to assess the effect of daily
supplementation with nutritional doses of antioxidants on the incidence
of cardiovascular diseases and cancers (32). In 1994–1995, 13,017
individuals (7876 women and 5141 men) were enrolled for an 8-y
intervention study. Follow-up of health events lasted until September
2007. The SU.VI.MAX study was conducted according to the Declara-
tion of Helsinki guidelines and was approved by the Paris-Cochin Hospital
Ethics Committee for Studies with Human Subjects (CCPPRB nos. 706 and
2364, respectively) and the French National Commission for Computed
Data and Individual Freedom (CNIL nos. 334641 and 907094, respec-
tively). Written informed consent was obtained from all participants.

Baseline data collection.
Information about sociodemographics,
smoking status, physical activity, and family history of prostate cancer
were collected by self-administered questionnaires for all participants at
enrollment. Anthropometric measures were obtained during a medical
examination by the study nurses and physicians.

Every 2 mo during the trial phase (1994–2002), participants were
invited to complete a 24-h dietary record via the Minitel Telematic
Network, a French telephone-based terminal equivalent to an Internet
prototype used widely at the beginning of the study. The records were
randomly distributed between weeks and weekends and over seasons to
take into account intra-individual variability. Participants assessed
portion sizes with the aid of a validated picture booklet (33), and the
amounts consumed from composite dishes were estimated using French
recipes validated by food and nutrition professionals. The mean daily
energy, alcohol, and nutrient intakes were estimated using a published

French food composition table (34). Total dietary ﬁber and soluble ﬁber
contents were obtained using the Association of Ofﬁcial Analytical
Chemists method (35). Dietary ﬁber intakes in the SU.VI.MAX study
were described previously (36). During the trial phase, participants were
advised against taking any self-prescribed supplementation. Fiber intake
from supplements is therefore most likely negligible in our study.

In the SU.VI.MAX cohort, a study was conducted to validate an FFQ
that was completed by the participants in 2007. This FFQ was compared
with 12 dietary records across 1 y (considered as the reference method).
Energy-adjusted deattenuated correlation coefﬁcients for total dietary
ﬁber intake between this FFQ and the 12 dietary records were 0.56 for
men and 0.63 for women (37). These coefﬁcients were similar to those
found in the EPIC cohort (0.54) (38).

A 35 mL fasting venous blood sample was collected in vacutainer
tubes. Blood samples were centrifuged immediately after blood draw,
and plasma aliquots were then preserved in sodium heparin. Less than
1 h after blood draw, plasma aliquots were stored at 220°C in dry ice for
shipment to the central biobank (maximum of 24 h), where they were
stored frozen in liquid nitrogen. These plasma samples were used to
determine the baseline concentrations of selenium, total prostate-speciﬁc
antigen (PSA) measured by immunoassay (Roche Diagnostics), IGF-
1 measured by immunometry on a Immulite analyzer (Diagnostics
Products Corporation), and IGF-2 measured by immunoradiometric
assays (Diagnostic Systems Laboratories). Coefﬁcients of variation for
the laboratory assays were 5.5% for total PSA, 5.3% for IGF-1, and
6.8% for IGF-2. Total PSA, IGF-1, and IGF-2 baseline concentrations
were measured in 2002–2003 as part of a post hoc research protocol
(39,40). The SU.VI.MAX investigators contacted the participants and
their treating physicians if their baseline PSA value was >4.0 mg/L.
Additional medical investigations were left to the discretion of the
treating physician (40).

Case ascertainment. During the follow-up period, participants were
invited to self-report health events (through a monthly questionnaire).
Investigations were then conducted to obtain medical data from
participants, physicians, and/or hospitals. All information was reviewed
by an independent physician expert committee, and cases were validated
with the pathologic reports and classiﬁed using the International Chronic
Diseases Classiﬁcation, 10th Revision, Clinical Modiﬁcation (41).
Cancers were validated by histologic reports, and all prostate cancer
cases were documented by a pathology report (32,39). All ﬁrst-incident
primary prostate cancers were considered as cases in this study.

Statistical analyses. From the 5141 male participants in the SU.VI.
MAX study, we excluded 41 men who reported a cancer diagnosis before
the start of the follow-up. Among the remaining participants, 3313
provided at least 3 valid 24-h dietary records within the ﬁrst 2 years of
follow-up and thus remained available for analysis. Participants
contributed person-time until the date of diagnosis of prostate cancer,
the date of last completed questionnaire, the date of death, or September
2007, whichever occurred ﬁrst. Participants who reported a cancer other
than prostate cancer during the study period (n = 163) were included and
censored at the date of diagnosis (except those with basal cell skin
carcinoma, which was not considered to be cancer). Nutrient intakes
were estimated by the mean intake calculated from all dietary records for
each man.

Baseline characteristics of participants were compared between
quartiles of total dietary ﬁber intake using x2 tests or Fisher tests
(ANOVA models). HRs and 95% CIs obtained from Cox proportional
hazards models, with age as the primary time variable, were used to
characterize the association between quartiles of dietary ﬁber intake and
incident of prostate cancer. We conﬁrmed that the assumptions of
proportionality were satisﬁed through examination of the log–log
(survival) vs. log–time plots. Different categories of dietary ﬁber were
tested according to their chemical properties (soluble and insoluble
ﬁbers) and according to their food sources (cereal, vegetable, fruit, and
legume ﬁbers). Tests for linear trend were performed using the ordinal
score on quartiles of ﬁber intake. Correlations between the different
types of dietary ﬁber intakes were analyzed using Spearman correlation
coefﬁcients. Multivariate models were adjusted for factors constitutive

to the study design [initial SU.VI.MAX trial intervention group (yes/no),
number of dietary records (continuous)], major sociodemographic
variables [age (timescale) and educational level (primary, secondary, or
university)], lifestyle factors [smoking status (never, former, or current),
physical activity (irregular, <1 h/d or $1 h/d walking or equivalent), and
alcohol intake (continuous)], anthropometric factors [height (continu-
ous) and BMI
factors indicating higher individual
susceptibility to prostate cancer [family history of prostate cancer (yes/
no) and baseline PSA concentration (continuous), as done previously
(4)], and dietary factors [dietary intakes of energy without alcohol,
calcium, processed meat, tomato products, and vitamin E (continuous)
and plasma selenium concentration (continuous)]. These factors were
those for which the association with prostate cancer risk was
established or suggested according to the 2007 WCRF report (22).
Adjustment for without-alcohol energy intake was performed by the
residual method (42). Stratiﬁed analyses were performed according to
overweight/obesity status (BMI <25 vs. $25 kg/m2), IGF-1 [<155 vs.
$155 mg/L (median)], and IGF-2 [<1078 vs. $1078 mg/L (median)]
intake [<23.4 vs. $23.4 g/d
plasma concentrations, and alcohol
(median)]. Interactions between these variables and quartiles of each

type of dietary ﬁber were tested by introducing the product of the
2 variables in the models. Interaction with the SU.VI.MAX trial
antioxidant supplementation group was also tested. All tests were
2 sided, and P < 0.05 was considered statistically signiﬁcant. SAS
version 9.3 (SAS Institute) was used for analyses.

Results

During a median follow-up of 12.6 y (37,877 person-years),
139 men developed a ﬁrst primary prostate cancer with a mean
age at diagnosis of 63 y. A total of 5.2% of the participants were
lost to follow-up. Table 1 presents the characteristics of the
participants according to quartiles of total dietary ﬁber intake.
Participants in the upper quartile tended to be older, taller, non-
smokers, more active physically, and had lower BMIs. The mean
dietary ﬁber intake was 21 6 7.3 g/d. Only 25% of the study
population reached the 25 g/d minimal French recommendation
(43). Main contributors to dietary ﬁber intake were cereals

(39.7%), vegetables (20.8%), fruits (19.8%), and legumes
(6.5%). Main contributors to insoluble ﬁber intake were cereals
(42%), vegetables (20%), fruits (20%), and legumes (7%), and
main contributors to soluble ﬁber intake were cereals (30%),
vegetables (26%), fruits (20%), and legumes (4%). The proportion
of insoluble/soluble ﬁber in each food source was as follows: 90/
10% for legumes, 84/16% for fruits (including nuts), 83/17% for
cereal products, and 74/26% for vegetables, respectively. Spearman
correlation coefﬁcients between the different types of ﬁber are
presented in Table 2. The ﬁber source with the highest correlation
with soluble ﬁber was vegetable ﬁber (Spearman r = 0.61, P <
0.05), and the ﬁber source with the highest correlation with
insoluble ﬁber was cereal ﬁber (Spearman r = 0.73, P < 0.05).

Table 3 summarizes the associations between dietary ﬁber
intake and prostate cancer risk. An inverse association was
found between prostate cancer risk and quartiles of total dietary
ﬁber intake (P = 0.001), insoluble ﬁber intake (P = 0.001), and
legume ﬁber intake (P = 0.04). No association was observed
between prostate cancer risk and quartiles of soluble ﬁber (P =
0.1), cereal ﬁber (P = 0.7), vegetable ﬁber (P = 0.9), and fruit
ﬁber (P = 0.4) intakes.

Legume intake (cutoffs for quartiles of the energy-adjusted
legume intake: 5.0, 16.3, and 34.1 g/d) was also associated with
decreased prostate cancer risk in our study (HR of quartile 4 vs.
quartile 1 = 0.48; 95% CI: 0.28, 0.83; P = 0.02; data not tabulated).
Although no interaction was statistically signiﬁcant between
ﬁber intake and BMI, IGFs, and alcohol intake, differences were
observed in stratiﬁed analyses (despite similar numbers of
participants in the compared groups). Total,
insoluble, and
legume ﬁber intakes were associated with decreased prostate
cancer risk in men with higher alcohol intake but not in men
with alcohol intake below the population median. The associ-
ation between legume ﬁber intake and prostate cancer risk
also tended to be stronger in overweight men and in those with
higher IGF-2 concentrations compared with normal-weight men
and those with IGF-2 amounts below the population median
(Supplemental Tables 1–4).

In sensitivity analyses, results remained unchanged after
exclusion of incident cases diagnosed within the ﬁrst 4 y of
follow-up (118 cases in 3292 men) or when considering only
men who completed more than 6 24-h dietary records during the
ﬁrst 2 y of follow-up (123 cases in 2771 men). Likewise, there
was no modiﬁcation when excluding soy and soy products from
legumes (for the association between legume ﬁber and prostate
cancer risk, HR of quartile 4 vs. quartile 1 = 0.56; 95% CI: 0.33,
0.97; P = 0.03), when adjusting for dairy product intake instead
of calcium intake or when including without-alcohol energy
intake (kilocalories per day) in all our models in addition to the

Discussion

In a context of scarce literature on the topic, this prospective
study investigated the association between different types of
dietary ﬁber and prostate cancer risk. We observed that total
dietary ﬁber intake and more speciﬁcally insoluble and legume
ﬁber intakes were associated with reduced prostate cancer risk.
In addition, to our knowledge, this study was the ﬁrst to consider
stratiﬁcation by IGF-1 or IGF-2 concentrations and by alcohol
intake and only the second to consider BMI subgroups despite
plausible mechanistic hypotheses. Although interactions were
not statistically signiﬁcant and overall similar trends were observed
in the studied subgroups, associations tended to be slightly stronger
in overweight/obese men and in those with IGF-2 concentra-
tions (legume ﬁber intake) and alcohol intake higher than the
population median (total, insoluble, and legume ﬁber intakes).
The few available prospective studies (23–26) showed
contrasting results. Three of them did not detect any association
between total dietary ﬁber intake and prostate cancer risk (23–
25), but no distinction was made between the type and source of
dietary ﬁber in these studies, and 1 of these studies provided only
unadjusted results (23). In men $65 y in the EPIC cohort, a
statistically signiﬁcant inverse association was observed between
fruit ﬁber and prostate cancer risk (26). A potential explanation
for these discrepancies could lie in the dietary assessment
method. Repeated 24-h dietary records (at least 3, mean of 9.7 6
3.3) were used in the present study, whereas other prospective
studies used an FFQ (25,26), which may attenuate the estimated
relative risks, as observed in 2 recent prospective studies on
dietary ﬁber intake and colorectal cancer risk (27) and on dietary
ﬁber intake and coronary heart disease risk (28). In these studies,
food diaries and FFQs were used within the same study
population, and statistically signiﬁcant associations were ob-
served when dietary ﬁber was measured by food diaries but not
by FFQs.

Our results are supported by mechanistic data. First, exper-
imental data suggested that inﬂammation has a pro-carcinigenic
role in prostate cancer development (1–3,44). Consistently, in a
prospective case-control study nested in the present cohort,
we observed previously that prediagnostic high sensitivity
C-reactive protein plasma concentration was directly associated
with increased prostate cancer risk (4). Experimental studies
showed that dietary ﬁbers exert a down-regulation role on
inﬂammation (15,45), probably through the production of
short-chain FAs when ﬁbers are fermented in the colon (46).
Fermentation products, particularly butyrate (47) and propio-
nate (48), have shown anti-inﬂammatory properties. Soluble
ﬁbers are highly fermentable, and colonic fermentation of
resistant starch, an insoluble ﬁber type, seems to produce
substantial amounts of butyrate (49) that enter the circulation
(50), thereby exerting anti-inﬂammatory activity.

Second, experimental studies also suggested that insulin
resistance and hyperinsulinemia, by increasing IGF concentra-
tions, may stimulate prostate carcinogenesis (5). Dietary ﬁber
may not be directly associated with IGF concentrations, but
several studies suggested that soluble ﬁber, insoluble ﬁber, and
resistant starch in particular may reduce insulin resistance
(16,17), notably through a decrease in carbohydrate absorption
rate (30,49,51), and increase IGFBP3 concentrations (18),
leading to decreased IGF bioactivity (1,5).

2 Cutoffs for quartiles of energy-adjusted dietary ﬁber intakes were 17.6, 20.4, and 23.7 g/d for total ﬁber; 14, 16.3, and 19 g/d for insoluble ﬁber; 3.4, 4, and 4.8 g/d for soluble
ﬁber; 6.6, 7.9, and 9.6 g/d for cereal ﬁber; 3, 4.1, and 5.5 g/d for vegetable ﬁber; 2.2, 3.7, and 5.6 g/d for fruit ﬁber; and 0.2, 0.8, and 2 g/d for legume ﬁber.
3 The crude model is adjusted for age (timescale), energy intake without alcohol (residual method), intervention group, and number of 24-h dietary records.
4 The multivariate model is adjusted for age (timescale), energy intake without alcohol, intervention group, number of 24-h dietary records, smoking status, educational level,
physical activity, height, BMI, alcohol intake, family history of prostate cancer, prostate-speciﬁc antigen, calcium intake, processed meat intake, tomato product intake, vitamin E
intake, and blood selenium.

Finally, increased concentrations of circulating androgenic or
estrogenic hormones could be associated with a greater risk of
prostate cancer (12). Dietary ﬁber may reduce concentrations of
circulating estrogens and androgens, notably through increased
SHBG concentration (19), modiﬁed enterohepatic circulation of
steroid hormones (decreased reabsorption of deconjugated
molecules) (30,52,53), and increased fecal excretion of these
hormones, resulting from binding to insoluble ﬁbers (21).

In this study, we observed an inverse association between
legume ﬁber intake and prostate cancer risk. Legume intake (in
grams per day) was also signiﬁcantly associated with a decreased
prostate cancer risk in our analyses, which was consistent with
the suggested inverse association between legume intake and
prostate cancer risk in the 2007 WCRF meta-analyses (22). It
may be difﬁcult to disentangle the effect of legume ﬁber from the
potential effect of other components found in legumes. Notably,
a role of soy phytoestrogens has been postulated to explain this
association (22). However, in our study, soy and soy product
intakes were very low; thus, they were not likely to entirely
explain the association between legumes and prostate cancer
risk. Furthermore, one prospective study (54) observed a signif-
icant inverse association between legume intake and prostate

508 Deschasaux et al.

cancer risk even after exclusion of soy, suggesting that phytoes-
trogens might not be the only explanation for the observed
association. In addition, mechanistic data support a potential role
of legume ﬁber in prostate cancer risk reduction because legume
ﬁber intake has been associated with improved glucose tolerance
(49), which may reduce prostate cancer risk (5). Moreover,
because legume ﬁber is mainly insoluble (49,55), results with
respect to insoluble and legume ﬁber intakes are consistent. The
proportion of insoluble ﬁber in cereals is also high (83%),
although lower than in legumes (90%). In addition, legumes
have a higher mean ﬁber density than cereal products (3.5 vs. 0.9
g/100 kcal). In the mid 1990s, whole-grain product intakes were
low, especially in men (56); thus, ﬁber intake from cereals was
also accompanied by relatively high lipid, sugar, and energy
intake. Even if we adjusted for these cofactors, it may be difﬁcult
to disentangle ﬁber intake from intake of these other compo-
nents. In a recent study, Hansen et al. (57) observed a decreased
risk of colon cancer associated with high cereal ﬁber intake,
more speciﬁcally from high-ﬁber cereal products but not from
low-ﬁber cereal products. This suggests that dietary ﬁber intake
might be more beneﬁcial when ﬁber intake comes from high-
ﬁber sources. This may explain why we observed an inverse

association between prostate cancer risk and legume ﬁbers but
not cereal ﬁbers.

Results from stratiﬁed analyses (although exploratory) sup-
port the abovementioned mechanical hypotheses: inverse asso-
ciations between legume ﬁber consumption and prostate cancer
risk were stronger in overweight men (inﬂammation pathway)
and in men with IGF-2 (insulin-resistance pathway) above the
population median, and inverse associations were stronger
between total, insoluble, and legume ﬁber intakes and prostate
cancer risk in men with alcohol consumption (circulating
estrogens pathway) above the population median.

Our study presented several strengths that pertained to its
prospective design, the diversity of types and sources of dietary
ﬁber investigated, and its originality with respect to existing
literature, notably regarding stratiﬁcations by BMI status, IGFs
concentrations, and alcohol intake.

Nevertheless, some limitations should be acknowledged.
First, the relatively small number of cases may have limited our
ability to detect some of the hypothesized associations, espe-
cially in stratiﬁed analyses. However, this is unlikely to explain
the observed relations that were statistically signiﬁcant despite
the potential power limitation. Second, only 1 IGF concentra-
tion measurement was available at baseline, and no information
was available for IGFBP3 concentrations, even though such
information could have provided additional arguments in terms
of mechanisms involved. Also, it would have been interesting to
stratify our analyses according to the amount of circulating
estrogens, but this information was not available. Third, the
observed relations could be partly affected by unmeasured or
residual confounding. However, main potential confounding
factors for prostate cancer risk have been accounted for in this
study [notably lifestyle factors indicating ‘‘healthy behaviors,’’
anthropometric factors, established or suspected dietary factors
according to the 2007 WCRF report (22), and factors indicating
higher susceptibility to prostate cancer risk]. Thus, it is unlikely
that residual confounding explains entirely the observed asso-
ciations. Finally, in the SU.VI.MAX study, PSA was measured in
2002–2003 from all baseline plasma samples. This systematic
testing may have introduced differences between our population
study and the general French population, with higher diagnosis
probability and overrepresentation of early-stage prostate can-
cers. Another limitation of our study was that the Gleason score
was not coded for all participants and thus could not be analyzed
in association with ﬁber intake. Because it has been suggested
that risk factors may differ according to the stage and aggres-
siveness of prostate cancer (2), this aspect should be investigated
in future cohort studies.

In conclusion, this prospective study observed that dietary ﬁber
intake (total, insoluble, and from legumes) was inversely associated
with prostate cancer risk, consistent with mechanistic data. These
results suggest a potentially protective involvement of dietary ﬁber
intake in prostate carcinogenesis. This must be conﬁrmed by
additional mechanistic and prospective epidemiologic studies,
especially taking into account the grade of prostate cancers.
