Abstract

Vitamin E (a -tocopherol) plays a key role in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation and has been studied as a

potential chemopreventive agent for prostate cancer. The association of serum vitamin E concentrations with cancer risk

may be modiﬁed by genetic variations in vitamin E–related genes. We examined whether variants in vitamin E–related genes

were associated with risk of prostate cancer in a nested case-control study using 483 prostate cancer cases and 542

matched controls of European ancestry from a large U.S. multicenter trial that had available measurements of serum vitamin

E concentrations and genotyping of 3 genome-wide association study meta-analysis–identiﬁed single-nucleotide polymor-

phisms (SNPs) associated with circulating vitamin E. ORs and 95% CIs were calculated using unconditional

logistic

regression adjusted for age, family history of prostate cancer, and serum total cholesterol. Findings suggest lower prostate

cancer risk for men whose genotypes reﬂect higher vitamin E (i.e., a-tocopherol) status. An SNP (rs964184) near budding-
site selection protein 13 (yeast) (BUD13), zinc ﬁnger protein 259 (ZNF259), and apolipoprotein A5 (APOA5) on 11q23.3 was
signiﬁcantly associated with prostate cancer risk (per-allele OR = 0.75; 95% CI: 0.58, 0.98; P-trend = 0.03). The association

between rs964184 and prostate cancer risk was stronger among homozygous carriers of the minor allele (OR = 0.27; 95%
CI: 0.09, 0.83). Another variant, rs11057830 in scavenger receptor class-B member 1 (SCARB1) on 12p24.31, approached
statistical signiﬁcance (OR = 0.32; 95% CI: 0.10, 1.01, P = 0.05; 2 minor allele copies). This study suggests that
polymorphisms near BUD13/ZNF259/APOA5, involved in vitamin E transport and metabolism, may be associated with lower

risk of prostate cancer. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00002540. J. Nutr. 144: 729–733, 2014.

Introduction

Vitamin E is a fat-soluble micronutrient consisting of 8 forms, a-,
b-, g-, and d- tocopherols and -tocotrienols (1). Some functions of
vitamin E include antioxidative and anti-inﬂammatory activities
(2–7), inhibition of cell proliferation and angiogenesis (8), and
induction of apoptosis (9). Cancer prevention studies with vitamin
E have focused primarily on a-tocopherol, and, although the bio-
logic effects of a-tocopherol have been investigated, our under-
standing of its role in inhibiting carcinogenesis remains incomplete.
Prostate cancer is the most common malignancy and the
second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in U.S. males;
however, the etiology and pathogenesis of prostate cancer remain

poorly understood. The association between circulating vitamin E
and risk of prostate cancer has been inconsistent in 12 prospective
studies, as summarized by Key et al. (10); the majority (n = 8) suggest
a protective association with RRs for high quantiles ranging from
0.49 to 0.85. The RRs for the remaining studies were 0.98, 1.00,
1.06, and 1.40. Furthermore, the association between vitamin E
supplementation and prostate cancer risk has been inconsistent
in randomized trials. Findings from the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-
Carotene Cancer Prevention Study suggest a signiﬁcant 32%
reduction in prostate cancer risk after 6-y trial supplementation
of 50 IU/d a-tocopherol in male smokers (11, 12), which was
supported by a subsequent trial examining 30 mg/d for 8 y (13).
In 2 recent trials, however, a-tocopherol doses of 400 IU/d for ;6
y (3) and 400 IU on alternate days for ;8 y (14) did not prevent
prostate cancer. Several studies suggest that the vitamin E–prostate
cancer association may be limited to smokers (11,15–18), and recently,
genetic variation in oxidative stress regulatory enzymes has been
shown to modify the association of circulating a-tocopherol
with aggressive prostate cancer among current smokers (16).

The association of vitamin E with prostate cancer risk might be
modiﬁed by genetic variations in vitamin E–related genes.

Genetic variants in genes involved in vitamin E transport or
metabolism may be important determinants of potential beneﬁcial
effects of vitamin E supplementation on prostate cancer risk (19).
In our previous genome-wide association studies (GWASs)6, we
identiﬁed regions of the genome that inﬂuence vitamin E bio-
chemical status, providing a framework for investigation of this
membrane-integrated micronutrient that is important in com-
plex chronic diseases, such as prostate cancer (20,21). To our
knowledge, no studies on the association between these GWAS-
identiﬁed vitamin E–associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) (i.e., rs964184, rs2108622, and rs11057830) and devel-
opment of prostate cancer have been published. The purpose of
this study is to examine whether variants in vitamin E–related
genes are associated with risk of prostate cancer.

Materials and Methods

Study participants. The Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian
(PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial was a multicenter, randomized con-
trolled trial of ;155,000 men and women conducted in the United States
to test the efﬁcacy of screening for prostate, lung, colorectal, and ovarian
cancers (22). Enrollment occurred from November 1993 through June
2001. Screening was performed at 10 centers located across the United
States, including the following: 1) Birmingham, Alabama; 2) Denver,
Colorado; 3) Detroit, Michigan; 4) Honolulu, Hawaii; 5) Marshﬁeld,
Wisconsin; 6) Minneapolis, Minnesota; 7) Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; 8)
Salt Lake City, Utah; 9) St. Louis, Missouri; and 10) Washington, DC.
Men in the screening arm received both serum prostate-speciﬁc antigen
(PSA) and digital rectal examination at study entry and then annually for
3 y and continued to receive PSA screening for years 4 and 5. Men with a
positive screening result (PSA > 4 mg/L or digital rectal examination
suspicious for prostate cancer) were referred to their medical care
providers for prostate cancer diagnostic evaluation. All men were
followed from their initial cancer screening to the occurrence of prostate
cancer, loss to follow-up, or death, whichever came ﬁrst. Clinical and
pathologic records, related to diagnostic follow-up of prostate cancer,
were obtained by certiﬁed tumor registrars at each screening center using
a standardized protocol. Aggressive cancers were deﬁned as Gleason
score $ 7 or stage III or IV of the tumor-node-metastasis staging system,
as deﬁned by the American Joint Committee on Cancer, at the time of
diagnosis because of our interest in the more clinically signiﬁcant but less
common aggressive forms of prostate cancer. Participants from a previous
nested case-control study on prostate cancer consisting of Caucasian
men, aged 55–74 y, with no previous history of prostate cancer before
random assignment were included in the present study if they were from
the screened arm of the study trial and had serum a-tocopherol con-
centration measured in provided blood samples (n = 1536 individuals)
(23). For our present analytic cohort, genotype data on vitamin E–related
polymorphisms were available for 483 cases and 542 controls (n = 1025;
97% of those with baseline serum). The institutional review boards of
the U.S. National Cancer Institute and the 10 study centers approved the
trial, and all participants provided written informed consent.

Phenotypic measurements and genotype data. Nonfasting baseline
blood specimens collected at the clinical centers were processed and
frozen within 2 h of blood draw and stored at 270°C. Serum concen-
trations of a-tocopherol were determined using reversed-phase HPLC
with UV detection (24). The estimated CV for a-tocopherol concentra-
tions was 5.8%. Total serum cholesterol was measured enzymatically by
a standard procedure at 37°C on a Hitachi 912 autoanalyzer. Genotyping
for SNPs was conducted previously using the TaqMan assay (Applied

tein A5 (APOA5) on 11q23.3, rs2108622 in cytochrome p450, family 4,
subfamily F, polypeptide 2 on 19pter-p13.11, and rs11057830 in scavenger
receptor class B member 1 (SCARB1) 12p24.31, which were found to be
associated with higher circulating vitamin E concentrations at the genome-
wide signiﬁcance level in our previous GWAS meta-analysis (19). The
overall completion rate was between 92% and 99%. Details for each
TaqMan assay may be found at http://variantgps.nci.nih.gov.

Statistical methods. Descriptive statistics were calculated for the
characteristics of prostate cancer cases and controls. The genotype
frequencies between the 2 groups were compared using x2 or FisherÕs
exact tests. There were no signiﬁcant deviations from Hardy-Weinberg
equilibrium observed (P > 0.05). Unconditional
logistic regression
models, adjusted for established risk factors of prostate cancer (age and
family history of prostate cancer) and serum concentrations of total
cholesterol, were used to estimate ORs and 95% CIs for the association
of each vitamin E–related SNP with overall prostate cancer risk assuming
an additive mode of inheritance. We adjusted for total cholesterol be-
cause it is well established that vitamin E concentrations are affected by
circulating lipids; inclusion of cholesterol in the models slightly at-
tenuated results, albeit not signiﬁcantly. Additional covariates consid-
ered included BMI, smoking status (never, former, or current smoker),
and history of diabetes. None of the additional covariates markedly
changed the results (<10% change in OR) and therefore were not
included in the ﬁnal parsimonious regression models. Sensitivity analyses
were conducted for aggressive and non-aggressive disease, in which
aggressive disease was deﬁned as Gleason score $ 7 or tumor stage III or
IV (25). The P value for trend was generated by entering the three-level
ordinal variable coded as the number of minor alleles (zero, 1, or 2) as a
single term in the model (i.e., 1 df). To more closely examine the results
of the tests for trend, we also report the ORs by genotype. Because of the
smaller number of cases with 2 copies of the minor allele, those with 1 or
2 copies were combined. In addition, a polygenic score was used to
examine the combined genetic effect of the 3 SNPs. Potential effect
modiﬁcation by smoking status (ever vs. never) and serum a-tocopherol
concentrations (above vs. below median cut point based on the
distribution among controls) was examined using stratiﬁed analyses
and by additionally including an interaction term in the same regression
model that included the SNP and potential effect modiﬁer. All statistical

Results

Among the 1025 men in this study sample, the mean age at study
entry was 64.8 y. A total of 116 (8%) men, 76 cases and 40
controls, reported having a family history of prostate cancer
(Table 1). Cases were also less likely to have a history of diabetes
or to be current smokers. The mean serum a-tocopherol con-
centration was 19 mg/L (44.1 mmol/L). Mean concentrations did
not vary signiﬁcantly between cases and controls.

The associations (per-allele ORs) between each of the 3 vitamin
E–related SNPs (rs964184, rs2108622, and rs11057830) and
prostate cancer risk are summarized in Table 2. The strongest
association was observed for rs964184, located at 11q23.3 (per-
allele OR = 0.75; 95% CI: 0.58, 0.98; P-trend = 0.03). We found
no strong evidence that associations between the 3 SNPs and
prostate cancer differed according to disease status, with risks for
aggressive cancer being similar to those for non-aggressive cancer
(Table 2). The results did not change after further excluding 4 cases
with stage III disease, which may represent non-lethal, local invasion.
Genotype associations for each SNP are reported in Table 3.
Minor allele carriers [i.e., men with 1 or 2 copies of the variant
(G) allele] of rs964184 had lower risks of prostate can-
cer compared with men with the more common genotype (CC)
(OR = 0.79; 95% CI: 0.59, 1.05). This ﬁnding was marginally
not statistically signiﬁcant (P = 0.06). However, homozygous
carriers of the G allele of rs964184 had a substantially reduced
risk of prostate cancer compared with homozygous carriers of
the common C allele (OR = 0.27; 95% CI: 0.09, 0.83). For
rs11057830, on 12q24.31, a marginally signiﬁcant association
was observed; men who carried 2 copies of the variant allele
(AA) had a lower risk of prostate cancer compared with men
with the wild type (GG) (OR = 0.32; 95% CI: 0.10, 1.01; P =
0.05). Although the associations between rs2108622 genotypes
and prostate cancer risk were in the same direction as the other
vitamin E–related SNPs, no signiﬁcant association was observed
(TT vs. CC; OR = 0.75; 95% CI: 0.44, 1.29). The analysis of a
combined genetic effect of the 3 SNPs as a score suggested a
decreased risk for men with 2 or more copies of minor alleles,
with an ORs of 0.25 among men with 4 or more copies;
however, results should be interpreted with caution given the

small number of men who had 4 or more copies of minor alleles
across the 3 SNPs (n = 10).

A signiﬁcant interaction was observed for rs11057830 (P-
interaction = 0.02), with the strongest association observed for
men with baseline serum a-tocopherol below median concentra-
tion values (per-allele OR = 0.71; 95% CI: 0.50, 1.01) (Table 4).
There was no effect modiﬁcation by serum concentrations of
a-tocopherol or smoking status for rs964184 and rs2108622,
partly because of the small sample sizes. The per-allele association
for rs964184 appeared to be stronger among men whose circu-
lating vitamin E concentrations were below the median value at

Discussion

The present study examined whether genetic variants identiﬁed
in our previous GWAS meta-analysis of circulating vitamin E
modiﬁed risk of prostate cancer. Speciﬁcally, we examined the
association between rs964181, rs2108622, and rs11057830 and
prostate cancer risk in a case-control study nested within the
PLCO Cancer Screening Trial. We found that a higher vitamin E
variant in a SNP near the BUD13/ZNF259/APOA5 region
(rs964184) was associated with a decreased risk of prostate
cancer as well as a suggested protective association for homo-
zygous carriers of the higher vitamin E allele (A) of rs11057830
in SCARB1. The cancer-risk associations for these SNPs were
directionally consistent with their relation to circulating vitamin
E (a-tocopherol) (20,21) (i.e., SNPs were associated with higher
concentrations of serum a-tocopherol, an antioxidant, assuming
an additive model in previous GWAS studies).

The mechanisms involved in the potential beneﬁts of vitamin
E in cancer may function at multiple levels. For example, its
antioxidant properties may protect against oxidative damage or
inhibit free radical–mediated lipid peroxidation within lipid-rich
regions of the cell. Alternatively, vitamin E may modify the signal
transduction cascade of proinﬂammatory cytokines through in-
hibition of NF-kb activation (26). Recent studies suggest that
polymorphisms in speciﬁc genes involved in vitamin E trans-
port, metabolism, and molecular action may also be important
determinants for the protective effects of vitamin E supplemen-
tation (16,19,27,28). In the present study, men who carried 2
copies of the minor allele for rs964184 had lower risks of
prostate cancer when compared with men with the wild-type
genotype. These results suggest that the BUD13/ZNF259/APOA5
variant allele may be associated with a reduction in prostate cancer
risk.

However, to our knowledge, no previous study has examined
the association between these GWAS-identiﬁed vitamin E–associated
genetic variants and prostate cancer risk. An association of serum
a-tocopherol and an effect modiﬁcation by polymorphisms in
oxidative stress regulatory enzymes has been reported in relation
to aggressive prostate cancer risk among current smokers (16).
Cigarette smokers with genetic variation in myeloperoxidase (GA
or AA genotypes; genotypes downregulating oxidative stress),
who had high serum a-tocopherol concentrations, had a reduced
risk (OR = 0.34; 95% CI: 0.15, 0.80) (16).

Strengths of the present study include the prospective design
of the PLCO Cancer Screening Trial in which blood samples
were collected years before the development of prostate cancer
and that the analyses were adjusted for established risk factors of
prostate cancer, including age and family history of prostate
cancer. A potential limitation is that our study was based on
older men of European ancestry and may not be generalizable to
younger and ethnically diverse populations. Furthermore, the
men in this analysis came from a highly screened population
with PSA-detected prostate cancer that may not be representa-
tive of all prostate cancers. Because of the limited statistical
power to detect associations among smokers, larger-scale studies
of these and other genetic variants yet to be identiﬁed that may
inﬂuence a-tocopherol concentrations may help reliably deter-
mine their association with prostate cancer risk among current
smokers.

In summary, we found that an SNP near the BUD13/
ZNF250/APOA5 region was associated with lower prostate
cancer risk among men of European ancestry. The association
for a second SNP, rs11057830 in SCARB1, was restricted to men
who had low serum a-tocopherol concentrations at study baseline.
These ﬁndings support the hypothesis that the variant allele may
enhance antioxidant enzyme activity or other functions; however,
more research is needed to substantiate this ﬁnding.
