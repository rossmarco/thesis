Abstract
The relation between meat consumption and colorectal
cancer risk remains controversial. In this report, we
quantitatively reviewed the prospective observational
studies that have analyzed the relation between meat
consumption and colorectal cancer. We conducted
electronic searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and
CANCERLIT databases through to the end of June 1999
and manual searches of references from retrieved
articles. We used both fixed and random-effects meta-
analytical techniques to estimate the overall association
and to investigate possible sources of heterogeneity
among studies. Thirteen studies were eligible for inclusion
in the meta-analysis. Pooled results indicate that a daily
increase of 100 g of all meat or red meat is associated
with a significant 12–17% increased risk of colorectal
cancer. The marginally significant between-study
heterogeneity for all meat and red meat was explained by
a number of study-level covariates. A significant 49%
increased risk was found for a daily increase of 25 g of
processed meat. The individual study estimates for
processed meat showed no detectable heterogeneity. On
the basis of this quantitative review of prospective
studies, the overall association between meat consumption
and risk of colorectal cancer appears to be positive, with
marginal heterogeneity between studies. The finding for
processed meat and data from experimental studies
suggests that it may also be an important predictor of
colorectal cancer risk. However, because only a few of the
studies reviewed here attempted to examine the
independent effect of meat intake on colorectal cancer
risk, the possibility that the overall association may be

Introduction
The relation between meat consumption and colorectal cancer
risk remains controversial (1–10). Subsequent to the report of
the National Academy of Sciences, “Diet and Health” (11),
which implicated red meat as a causative factor in the etiology
of colorectal cancer, two subsequent reports have reviewed the
epidemiological evidence on meat and colorectal cancer risk (4,
7). The report of the WCRF3 concluded: “The evidence shows
that red meat probably increases risk and processed meat pos-
sibly increases risk of colorectal cancer” (7). The report from
COMA judged that “there is moderately consistent evidence
from cohort studies of a positive association between the con-
sumption of red or processed meat and risk of colorectal can-
cer” (4). A WHO consensus statement reached a similar con-
clusion, stating that “consumption of red meat is probably
associated with increased colorectal cancer risk,” but also stated
that epidemiological studies on meat and colorectal cancer risk
are not consistent (2).

Both the COMA and WCRF reports made dietary recom-
mendations based on their qualitative assessments of the epi-
demiological literature. The WCRF report recommended lim-
iting “intake of red meat to less than 80 g daily.” The COMA
report, targeted at the population of the United Kingdom, ad-
vised that consumption of red and processed meat for those
consuming population average levels (;90 g/day for the United
Kingdom population) should not rise. It also recommended that
people who are consuming high levels (.140 g cooked weight/
day) should consider a reduction.

In contrast, other researchers have noted that “it remains
uncertain whether meat is a risk factor for cancer” (12) and that
the current prospective evidence on meat and colorectal cancer
risk “is now clearly negative for this association” (3). It has also
been suggested that any association between high meat con-
sumption and colorectal cancer may be as a result of deficien-
cies in other protective dietary factors, such as vegetables and
fruits (1, 13). References to studies in many of these reports,
reviews, and discussion articles are incomplete and limited;
therefore, we aimed to review prospective cohort studies that
have investigated the relation between meat and colorectal
cancer risk. In addition, given that quantitative recommenda-
tions— based on qualitative assessments of the literature— have
been made, we sought to use quantitative review methods to

both confirm the current recommendations and to investigate

Materials and Methods
Inclusion Criteria. We sought to include both published and
unpublished prospective cohort studies that contained risk es-
timates of colorectal cancer associated with meat consumption.
A broad definition of “meat” was used, which was taken to
include red meat, lamb, beef, pork, and processed meats, such
as sausages, meat burgers, ham, bacon and other meat products,
but which, where possible, excluded white meat, such as poul-
try. Eligible outcomes were colon or colorectal cancer inci-
dence or mortality.
Exclusion Criteria. We excluded case-control and ecological
studies. Case-control studies, where diet is assessed after the
onset of disease, may be subject to information (recall) and
selection bias, and inaccurate or biased measurements of die-
tary exposure attributable to dietary changes as a result of
disease (14). Ecological studies, which analyze aggregated data
at the level of the population, may be subject to confounding
and cannot reliably be extrapolated to the individual level (15).
Studies that only classified people as to whether they ate meat
or not were also excluded from the analysis, because the level
of exposure in the exposed group is not quantified (16).
Search Strategy. We conducted electronic searches of MED-
LINE, EMBASE, and CANCERLIT databases through the end

of June 1999. A search strategy that included both truncated
free-text and exploded MeSH terms was used. MeSH headings
included “colorectal,” “colon,” “bowel,” “rectum,” “diet,”
“meat,” “cancer,” “neoplasm,” “prospective,” “follow-up,” or
“cohort” and their variants. All references that matched the
inclusion criteria were retrieved and the references of those
articles were checked for other relevant publications. Refer-
ences contained in recent reviews of the literature were also
consulted (4, 7, 8). Finally, principal investigators responsible
for the collated studies and authors of recent reviews were
contacted for any unpublished or missed research.
Data Extraction and Classification. Rate ratios, 95% confi-
dence intervals, and various study characteristics were ex-
tracted from the original reports and included in the meta-
analysis (Table 1). The extracted data for each study were then
sent to the original investigator for review and to request any
additional data that were required for the meta-analysis.

For each study, the median level of meat consumption
(g/day) for each quantile was assigned to each corresponding
rate ratio. This was either taken from the report or requested
from the investigators (17–26). If the data were unavailable, the
median was estimated as the midpoint of each quantile (22, 25,
27, 29), and the amount consumed in g/day was estimated by
multiplying the median frequency of consumption by the av-
erage portion (serving) size for the cohort population (18, 21,
22, 24 –27, 29). If they were unavailable, portion sizes were

estimated using data from another cohort from the same country
(18, 24, 26, 27, 29). For the Hirayama study (28), 100 g was
used as the average portion size.
Exposure Definition. Because “meat” has no common defi-
nition, meat was defined and analyzed in several ways. Risk
estimates obtained from the publications were collectively cat-
egorized into “All meat.” This included meat defined in the
individual publications as “all meat,” “meat,” “other meat,”
“fatty meat,” “fresh meat,” “red meat,” and “total meat.” In
addition, meat was also categorized into more specific defini-
tions, i.e., “Red meat” and “Processed meat,” Risk estimates
categorized as red meat included meat defined in the individual
publications as “red meat” or “fatty meat,” and for processed
meat as “processed meat,” “cured meat,” “nitrate meat,” or
“sausages.”
Statistical Methods and Analyses. Standard weighted least-
squares regression was used to model the log rate ratios for
colorectal cancer risk as a linear function of meat intake,
adjusting for covariance (30 –32). This provided an estimate of
the regression coefficient and its SE for each study. Risk
estimates for portion sizes were based on approximations for
comparison purposes only and on amounts that fitted the data
range: 100 g for all meat and red meat, and 25 g for processed
meat.

An overall summary estimate of the individual study es-
timates of bwas calculated using both fixed and random-effects
meta-analysis (33, 34). Heterogeneity among studies was as-
sessed using the Q statistic (34) and by comparing both ran-
dom- and fixed-effects estimates (35). To test the appropriate-
ness of a linear model, individual study estimates were grouped
into quartiles of exposure (36 –38). Because there was no de-
tectable heterogeneity among risk estimates within quartiles
(P . 0.10), we used standard fixed-effects meta-analysis to
estimate the overall relative risk for each quartile of exposure
for all meat, red meat and processed meat separately (36). This
method gave almost identical results to the full parametric
method, suggesting that the linear model was appropriate.

Random-effects meta-regression was used to investigate
sources of heterogeneity and to provide an estimate of unex-
plained or residual heterogeneity, t2 (39 – 41). Only those a
priori study-level covariates that denoted significant linear de-
pendency are reported here. Study-level covariates included
outcome definition (incidence or mortality), cancer definition
(colon or colorectal), loss to follow-up, duration of follow-up,
magnitude of exposure differential between exposed and unex-
posed, diet validation, adjustment for energy intake, and the
number of confounders included in the analysis. We made no
attempt to use a scoring system for study “quality”; instead, the
components of study quality were used as covariates in the
investigation of heterogeneity (42). Publication bias was as-
sessed using the methods outlined by Egger et al. (43).

Results
A total of 17 publications were identified with data that were
potentially eligible for inclusion in the review and meta-anal-
ysis (17–29, 44, 47). Fifteen of the studies were published in
peer-reviewed journals, one as a book (28), and one as part of
a congress report (29). Studies were excluded if they classified
people only as to whether they ate meat or not (44, 45), if they
were pooled analyses of original studies (44), and if the data in
the reports were superseded by later publications (46, 47). This
left 13 publications. Table 1 lists the studies and selected
characteristics. On request, additional information was supplied
by authors (17–22, 24 –27, 29).

All Meat. For all meat, 12 of 17 estimated regression coeffi-
cients were positive (Table 2). For a 100-g portion, the esti-
mated rate ratios ranged from 0.55 (0.20 –1.55; Ref. 28) to 1.73
(1.25–2.39; Ref. 22). Fig. 1 shows the estimated rate ratios and
95% confidence intervals for each study for an increment of one
portion of all meat using a random-effects model. The com-
bined OR for all studies was 1.12 (1.05–1.20) for the fixed-
effects model and 1.14 (1.04 –1.25) for the random-effects
model. A formal test for heterogeneity among studies was not
significant [Q 4 statistic (Q) 5 22.48; df, 16; P 5 0.13].
However, because of the low power of the test, additional
analysis of heterogeneity was warranted. When we fitted a
random-effects meta-regression model with no covariates, we
estimated the between-study variance as t2 5 0.0052. The
estimate of t2, in comparison to that when the covariate is
omitted, allows the proportion of the heterogeneity explained
by the covariate to be calculated. Including whether the study
outcome was mortality or incidence as a covariate explained all
of the between-study variance and was nearly statistically sig-
nificant (P 5 0.06). Therefore, for a comparable level of
exposure, the summary OR for studies reporting incidence was
higher than the summary OR for studies reporting mortality
(Table 3). No other explanations of heterogeneity were found.
Processed Meat. For processed meat, 9 of 10 estimated re-
gression coefficients were positive. For a 25-g portion, the
estimated rate ratios ranged from 0.88 (0.49 –1.57; Ref. 18) to

and 95% confidence intervals for each study for an increment
of one portion of processed meat using a random-effects model.
The combined OR for all studies was 1.49 (1.22–1.81) for both
the random- and fixed-effects models. A formal test for heter-
ogeneity among studies was not significant (Q 5 5.24; df, 9;
P 5 0.81), and we estimated no between-study variance, t2 5
0. As expected, no significant explanations of heterogeneity
were found.
Red Meat. For red meat, all eight of the estimated regression
coefficients were positive. For a 100-g portion, the estimated
rate ratios ranged from 1.03 (0.88 –1.20; Ref. 24) to 1.73
(1.25–2.39; Ref. 22). Fig. 3 shows the estimated rate ratios and
95% confidence intervals for each study for an increment of one
portion of red meat using a random-effects model. The com-
bined OR for all studies was 1.13 (1.05–1.21) for the fixed-
effects model and 1.17 (1.05–1.31) for the random-effects
model. A formal test for heterogeneity among studies suggested
near significance (Q 5 12.6; df, 7; P 5 0.08). Using a random-
effects meta-regression model with no covariates, the between-
study variance was estimated as t2 5 0.0095. Including
whether the study outcome was mortality or incidence as a
covariate explained all of the between-study variance (P 5

0.02). A similar effect was seen when we substituted outcome
for a covariate indicating whether a dietary validation study had
been undertaken (P 5 0.03), or whether studies had adjusted for
energy intake (P 5 0.02). Therefore, for a comparable level of
exposure, the summary ORs for studies that reported incidence,
undertook a diet validation study, or adjusted for total energy
intake were significantly higher than the summary ORs for
studies that reported mortality or did not undertake a diet
validation study or adjust for total energy intake, respectively
(Table 2). No other explanations of heterogeneity were found.

Discussion
Summary of Main Findings. In this exploratory meta-analy-
sis, we found a positive association between all meat and red
meat consumption and risk of colorectal cancer. Pooled results
indicate that a daily increase of 100 g of all meat or red meat
is associated with a significant 12–17% increased risk of colo-
rectal cancer. The marginally significant between-study heter-
ogeneity for all meat and red meat was explained by a number
of study-level covariates (Table 3). A significant 49% increased
risk was found for a daily increase of 25 g of processed meat.

comparable levels of exposure, showed no detectable hetero-
geneity.
Limitations. The pooled estimates reported here are based on
estimates derived from observational prospective cohort stud-
ies; therefore, the possibility of residual confounding or bias
cannot be excluded (48). Because only 13 studies with 17 risk
estimates were included, the power to discriminate among
different covariates was limited. Also, as a result of collinearity
among study-level covariates and similarities among study
characteristics (Table 1), we were unable to determine whether
their effects were independent of other study-level covariates.
Tests for publication bias have generally low power and, be-
cause of the potential for biases and residual confounding, may
not be appropriate for observational studies (41). Only studies
for red meat showed significant publication bias favoring a
positive association (P 5 0.03). Although we sought to include
both published and unpublished studies, a potential for selec-
tion bias exists because we did not include non-English lan-
guage and abstract-only publications, and we may have missed
unpublished data.

Interpretation of Heterogeneity. Validity or relative validity
studies are used to determine the magnitude of error of an
exposure measure and evaluate its effect on the relation under
study (49). The effect of random measurement error is to make
the observed disease/exposure relation weaker than the true
relation. If we take the viewpoint that studies with validated
exposure assessments are studies with better measures of ex-
posure and, therefore, less random error in exposure measure-
ment, then higher risk estimates would be expected (Table 2).
This attenuation of the estimated risk has led researchers to
apply a correction or deattenuation factor based on relative
validity studies of exposure assessment. However, rarely is the
measure of association between the test and reference measure
used in the adjustment of risk estimates (50). Earlier methods to
correct for measurement error assumed that the reference meas-
ure contains only random within-person errors uncorrelated
with errors in the test measure; assumptions which may not be
true (49). Recent findings have indicated that failure to account
for person-specific biases in the reference and test measures,
and correlated errors among measurements, could lead to sig-

444 Meat Consumption and Colorectal Cancer Risk

nificant distortions in the estimation of the corrected relative
risk of disease for a dietary exposure (49, 51). Errors in the
measurement of potential confounders may also be a possible
source of bias. This bias could result from both the extent of
measurement error and from correlation among measurement
errors of the exposure and potential confounders (52). The latter
could be especially likely in food-frequency questionnaires,
because individual perceptions could influence responses to a
number of questions. Furthermore, the possibility of residual
confounding attributable to unmeasured confounders may also
exist.

It is unlikely that there is any real difference among
incidence and mortality studies (Table 2). In this analysis, the
pooled estimate is lower for mortality studies, implying that
meat consumption reduces case-fatality. If meat consumption is
a risk factor for etiology and not survival, then we would expect
the ratio of disease rates among unexposed and exposed groups
to be similar for both incidence and mortality studies. To
complicate any additional interpretation, there is also the addi-
tional factor of changes in diet as a result of disease. In addition,
because studies analyzing incidence were also studies that had,
in general, undertaken diet validation studies, collinearity be-
tween these two study-level covariates may explain the differ-
ence between incidence and mortality studies. These method-
ological covariates may also be indicative of study “quality.”
An earlier qualitative comparison of low- and high-quality
studies on meat and cancer found that high-quality studies, as
defined, found stronger associations than low-quality studies
(53).

Total energy intake is positively correlated to consumption
of most foods, including meat, and may also be an independent
risk factor for colorectal cancer (7). In addition, much of the
variation in energy intake relates to factors such as body size
and physical activity, which may also independently influence
the risk of colorectal cancer (4, 7, 54). This added interindi-
vidual variation may produce an additional source of error (14).
Therefore, failure to adjust for total energy intake and its
correlates may confound the reported associations, and the
independent effect of meat consumption would be difficult to
determine. However, the effect of this confounding would be
dependent upon the relation and strength of association among
correlates of energy intake within the individual studies.
Meat and Other Dietary and Associated Factors. The esti-
mation of disease risk associated with a particular dietary factor
may be influenced by the presence of other dietary and asso-
ciated factors. High-meat diets have been negatively associated
with food groups rich in antioxidants and fiber (55); compo-
nents which have been associated with a reduced risk of colo-
rectal cancer (4, 7, 56). Two of the studies included in the
review (19, 28) suggested interaction with other dietary and
associated factors. Singh et al. (19) found that individuals with
a high meat intake, a low legume (pulses), intake and high body
mass experienced a .3-fold increase in risk relative to other
patterns based on these variables. The study by Hirayama (28),
in a separate analysis, found an increased risk of colon cancer
in men consuming meat daily but rarely eating green-yellow
vegetables, and a decreased risk in men consuming both red
meat and green-yellow vegetables daily. However, the current
prospective epidemiological data show only a weak negative
association between vegetables and fruits consumption and risk
of colorectal cancer (4, 7). Four recent studies, two randomized
trials on adenoma recurrence (57, 58) and two large prospective
studies on colorectal cancer (59, 60) found no association
among fiber, vegetables, and fruits consumption and risk of

colorectal cancer. The two prospective studies based on the
Nurses’ Health Study (59) and a combined analysis of the
Nurses’ Heath Study and the Health Professionals’ Follow-up
Study (60) both adjusted for red meat intake when ascertaining
the effect of fiber and vegetables and fruits consumption on
colorectal cancer risk, respectively. The multivariate estimates
did not materially differ from the unadjusted estimates. Both
studies found no association among vegetables and fruits or
fiber intake and risk of colorectal cancer. Thus, the effect of
meat consumption on the risk of colorectal cancer may be
modified or confounded by other dietary and associated life-
style factors. However, although they may be correlated, it is
unlikely that vegetables and fruits consumption may signifi-
cantly confound this relation.
Biological Mechanisms. The biochemical mechanisms and
genetic models by which high consumption of red and pro-
cessed meat may increase the risk of colorectal cancer have
been discussed in numerous reports (9, 61– 63). These include
the formation from meat products of carcinogenic agents such
as N-nitroso compounds, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons,
and HCAs. The finding for processed meat is consistent with a
role for N-nitroso compounds (64). N-nitroso compounds,
which are also produced via endogenous synthesis (64), are
found almost exclusively in foods containing nitrites or which
have been exposed to nitrogen oxides, such as processed meats
(65). HCAs, which have been shown to be strong mutagens, are
formed on the surface of meat when it is cooked in direct flame
or at high temperatures (62). HCAs require metabolic activation
to function as mutagens, and genetic polymorphisms for these
enzymes have been shown to interact with meat consumption
and modify the risk of colorectal cancer (66, 67).
Conclusions. In the context of cancer prevention only, our
findings are in general agreement with the conclusions outlined
in the COMA and WCRF reports (4, 7). On the basis of this
quantitative review of prospective studies, the overall associa-
tion between meat consumption and risk of colorectal cancer
appears to be positive, with marginal heterogeneity among
studies. The finding for processed meat and the data from
experimental studies suggest that it may also be an important
predictor of colorectal cancer. However, whether meat con-
sumption is an independent risk factor for colorectal cancer is
uncertain. Colorectal carcinogenesis is a multifactorial and
multistep process that may involve several biological pathways
and an accumulation of genetic alterations (62, 68), and it is
unlikely that determinants of colorectal cancer work in isolation
from each other. Indeed, frequent consumption of meat is
associated with a number of predictors of colorectal cancer (19,
55). Moreover, because only a few of the studies attempted to
examine the independent effect of meat consumption, we can-
not exclude the possibility that the association may be con-
founded or modified by genetic or dietary and associated fac-
tors (4, 7, 62, 66).
