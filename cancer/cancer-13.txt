Context Evidence is lacking that a dietary pattern high in vegetables, fruit, and fiber
and low in total fat can influence breast cancer recurrence or survival.
Objective To assess whether a major increase in vegetable, fruit, and fiber intake
and a decrease in dietary fat intake reduces the risk of recurrent and new primary breast
cancer and all-cause mortality among women with previously treated early stage breast
cancer.
Design, Setting, and Participants Multi-institutional randomized controlled trial
of dietary change in 3088 women previously treated for early stage breast cancer who
were 18 to 70 years old at diagnosis. Women were enrolled between 1995 and 2000
and followed up through June 1, 2006.
Intervention The intervention group (n=1537) was randomly assigned to receive a
telephone counseling program supplemented with cooking classes and newsletters that
promoted daily targets of 5 vegetable servings plus 16 oz of vegetable juice; 3 fruit serv-
ings; 30 g of fiber; and 15% to 20% of energy intake from fat. The comparison group
(n=1551) was provided with print materials describing the “5-A-Day” dietary guidelines.
Main Outcome Measures Invasive breast cancer event (recurrence or new pri-
mary) or death from any cause.
Results From comparable dietary patterns at baseline, a conservative imputation analy-
sis showed that the intervention group achieved and maintained the following statis-
tically significant differences vs the comparison group through 4 years: servings of veg-
etables, ⫹65%; fruit, ⫹25%; fiber, ⫹30%, and energy intake from fat, −13%. Plasma
carotenoid concentrations validated changes in fruit and vegetable intake. Through-
out the study, women in both groups received similar clinical care. Over the mean
7.3-year follow-up, 256 women in the intervention group (16.7%) vs 262 in the com-
parison group (16.9%) experienced an invasive breast cancer event (adjusted hazard
ratio, 0.96; 95% confidence interval, 0.80-1.14; P=.63), and 155 intervention group
women (10.1%) vs 160 comparison group women (10.3%) died (adjusted hazard ra-
tio, 0.91; 95% confidence interval, 0.72-1.15; P=.43). No significant interactions were
observed between diet group and baseline demographics, characteristics of the origi-
nal tumor, baseline dietary pattern, or breast cancer treatment.
Conclusion Among survivors of early stage breast cancer, adoption of a diet that
was very high in vegetables, fruit, and fiber and low in fat did not reduce additional
breast cancer events or mortality during a 7.3-year follow-up period.

high in vegetables and fruit and low in
total fat and prevention of cancer pro-
gression has been mixed in epidemio-
logical studies.3-17 An interim analysis
of data from the Women’s Interven-
tion Nutrition Study (WINS), which as-
sessed the effect of a dietary interven-
tion designed to reduce fat intake on
relapse-free survival in breast cancer pa-
tients,18 found that the intervention was
associated with a marginally statisti-
cally significant improvement in re-
lapse-free survival. To our knowledge,
no other clinical trials investigating di-
etary change and breast cancer sur-
vival have been reported.

The Women’s Healthy Eating and
Living (WHEL) Study was a random-
ized trial assessing whether a dietary
pattern very high in vegetables, fruit,
and fiber and low in fat reduces the risks
of recurrent and new primary breast
cancer and all-cause mortality among
women with previously treated early
stage breast cancer. The study was based
on the recommendations of a national
committee of experts called to re-
spond to a 1993 challenge grant from
a private philanthropist who believed
that the role of diet in preventing can-
cer progression deserved scientific study
to enable cancer survivors to make de-
cisions without having “to rely on folk-
lore, rumor and hearsay.”19

METHODS
Details of the study design, eligibility
criteria, randomization procedures, and
dietary intervention have been re-
ported previously.20,21 In brief, we com-
pared 2 dietary patterns: an interven-
tion group that was intensively
counseled to adopt a dietary pattern
very high in vegetables, fruit, and fi-
ber and low in fat21 and a comparison
group advised to follow the 5-A-Day
diet.22,23 The study tested primary hy-
potheses of whether the intervention di-
etary pattern was associated with (1) a
longer breast cancer event–free inter-
val and (2) increased overall survival
among women previously treated for
early stage breast cancer. Based on the
6 epidemiological studies that had been
published at the time of the trial de-

sign, we estimated the likely effect size
of this multicomponent diet.20 Follow-
ing Lachin and Foulkes,24 we deter-
mined that a sample size of 3000 would
have 82% power to detect a 19% re-
duction in additional breast cancer
events in the intervention group (ex-
pected comparison group rate=24%)
and a 24% reduction in all cause mor-
tality (expected comparison group
rate=15%).

Participants
Participants were enrolled at 7 study
sites between 1995 and 2000. Eligibil-
ity criteria included diagnosis of a pri-
mary operable invasive breast carci-
noma categorized using American Joint
Committee on Cancer (edition IV) cri-
teria as stage I (ⱖ1 cm), stage II, or stage
IIIA within the past 4 years; age at di-
agnosis between 18 and 70 years; treat-
ment with axillary dissection and total
mastectomy or lumpectomy followed
by primary breast radiation; no cur-
rent or planned chemotherapy; no evi-
dence of recurrent disease or new breast
cancer since completion of initial lo-
cal treatment; and no other cancer in
the past 10 years. Eligible women were
randomly assigned to either the study
dietary pattern or the comparison group
(FIGURE 1). The institutional review
boards at the 7 clinical sites approved
the study protocol and consent forms,
and all participants provided written in-
formed consent.

Dietary Intervention
The intensive intervention was deliv-
ered primarily by telephone counsel-
ing, supplemented with 12 cooking
classes in the first year and monthly
newsletters throughout the study.
Trained counselors21 followed a com-
puter-assisted protocol that was based
on social cognitive theory25 and had 3
phases of decreasing intensity. During
the first phase (3-8 calls in 4-6 weeks),
counselors focused on building self-
efficacy to implement the study tar-
gets, which consisted of daily intake of
5 vegetable servings plus 16 oz of veg-
etable juice, 3 fruit servings, 30 g of fi-
ber, and 15% to 20% of energy intake

from fat. Phase 2 (through 5 months)
focused on self-monitoring and dealt
with barriers to adherence. Phase 3
(through study completion) focused on
retaining motivation for the study di-
etary pattern and preventing setbacks.
During the first year of the interven-
tion, participants received an average
of 18 counseling calls, attended an av-
erage of 4 of 12 offered cooking classes,
and received 12 study newsletters. By
4 years, a key point for assessing long-
term effect, these participants had re-
ceived an average of 31 calls and 48
newsletters.

Women randomized to the compari-
son group were provided with print ma-
terials (from the US Department of Ag-
riculture26 and the National Cancer
Institute22,23) describing a diet with a
recommended daily intake of 5 serv-
ings of vegetables and fruit, more than
20 g of fiber, and less than 30% total
energy intake from fat. The compari-
son group attended an average of 1 of
4 offered cooking classes in the first year
and received 24 newsletters tailored to
the comparison group during the first
4 years.

Data Collection
Dietary Assessment. Dietary intake was
assessed by sets of 4 prescheduled 24-
hour dietary recalls conducted by tele-
phone on random days over a 3-week
period, stratified for weekend vs week-
days.20 These dietary recalls were sched-
uled for all participants at baseline, 1
year, 4 years, and 6 years and on 50%
random samples at 6, 24, and 36 months.
We report data for participants complet-
ing follow-up assessments. We also con-
ducted additional analyses as follows: for
participants who did not complete fol-
low-up assessments we imputed esti-
mates by assuming that they changed di-
etary intake in a manner similar to
comparison group respondents, using
the expectation maximization algo-
rithm in SAS software, version 9.1 (SAS
Institute Inc, Cary, North Carolina).27 As
previously described,20 dietary asses-
sors completed a training program and
used the multipass software-driven re-
call protocol of the Nutritional Data Sys-

tem software (NDS-R, 1994-2006, Uni-
versity of Minnesota, Minneapolis). To
assess overall adherence, we developed
an adherence score.20 A completely ad-
herent participant would score 600
points: 300 points reflected vegetable
consumption and the remaining 300
points were divided equally among fi-
ber, fruit, and energy from fat.

Other Data Collection. We collected
adetailedfamilyhistoryofcanceratbase-
line and used the mutation prevalence
tables from Myriad Genetic Laboratories
(Salt Lake City, Utah)28 to classify fami-
lies with at least a 10% risk of a BRCA1/2
mutation as high-risk. Clinic visits con-
ducted at baseline, 1 year, 2 or 3 years
(randomly determined), 4 years, and 6
years included measured weight and ve-
nipuncture. Separated blood samples
were stored in cryovials in −80°C freez-
ers for later analysis. Participants were
mailed a set of study questionnaires to
complete and bring to each clinic visit,
including a health status questionnaire
with questions on recent physician vis-
its and 2 questionnaires used in the
Women’s Health Initiative: the Personal
Habits Questionnaire,29 which included
a9-itemmeasureofphysicalactivityvali-
dated for our study30 and from which we
calculatedmetabolicequivalenttaskmin-
utes per week,31 and the Thoughts and
FeelingsQuestionnaire,32whichincluded
measures of psychosocial functioning.
Each participant self-reported race/
ethnicity as 1 of 8 categories.

Assessment of Study Outcomes
Primary study end points were (1) the
combined outcome of invasive breast
cancer recurrence or new primary
breast cancer and (2) death due to any
cause. Recurrences were further clas-
sified as local/regional or distant me-
tastasis. Carcinoma in situ was not
counted as a study outcome. The breast
cancer event–free interval was defined
as the time from date of enrollment to
development of a new breast cancer
event. Follow-up time was censored at
the time of the participant’s death, at
the last documented staff contact date,
or at the study completion date (June
1, 2006).

During semiannual telephone inter-
views, clinical site staff queried study par-
ticipants regarding the occurrence of out-
come events, any hospitalization, or new
or existing medical diagnoses. Any re-
port of a breast cancer event or death trig-
gered a confirmation interview and col-
lection of medical records and/or death
certificates. Two independent oncolo-
gists reviewed the medical records (pa-
thology reports and physician notes) to
confirm reported recurrences. In cases
of disagreement, the coordinating cen-
ter pathologist adjudicated the out-
come. Finally, we searched the Na-
tional Death Index using Social Security
number, name, and date of birth.

Statistical Analysis
Participants were randomly assigned to
the intervention or comparison group
using a random permuted-block design
stratified by tumor stage, age, and clini-
cal site. The allocation of participants was

conducted by the clinical site coordina-
tor running the study’s randomization
computer program, which automati-
cally stamped the assigned study group
in the database. An independent data and
safety monitoring committee con-
ducted a blind review of potential post-
randomization exclusions.20

Baseline group comparisons of demo-
graphic, anthropometric, clinical, and
dietary measures were conducted with
2-sided t tests, rank-sum tests, or ␹2
tests. We based the primary analysis of
disease-free survival on the intention-
to-treat principle using time-to-event
methods. A 2-sided log-rank test was
performed with P⬍.041 considered sta-
tistically significant (to account for in-
terim analyses undertaken at the re-
quest of the data and safety monitoring
committee). Both unadjusted and ad-
justed hazard ratios were computed. We
fit a Cox model stratified by stage, age,
and clinical site.

The frequencies of antiestrogen
therapy use and bilateral oophorecto-
mies differed marginally between study
groups at baseline; therefore, these co-
variates were also included in the model.
However, the antiestrogen therapy vari-
able did not satisfy the proportional haz-
ards assumption; hence, the analysis was
stratified by this covariate.33 Thus, the fi-
nal model was stratified by stage of ini-
tial tumor, age at randomization, clini-
cal site, and antiestrogen use and was
adjusted for oophorectomy status.

The a priori analysis plan20 in-
cluded fitting a Cox proportional haz-
ards model to evaluate the effect of the
intervention on key covariates. These
included stage of disease (classified as
I, II, or III), age at randomization (⬍55
years vs ⱖ55 years), hormone recep-
tor characteristics of initial tumor, body
mass index, and years from diagnosis
to randomization. Product terms be-
tween randomization assignment and
indicator variables for covariate cat-
egories were included in Cox regres-

were formally tested for significance
with likelihood ratio tests. The results
are presented as hazard ratios and 95%

In additional analyses, we exam-
ined possible interactions between
study group and the baseline dietary
factors targeted by the intervention
(vegetable, fruit, fiber, and fat in-
takes) to address whether the effects of
the dietary intervention might vary by
baseline intake level.

Analyses were conducted in the sta-
tistics software package R, version 2.3.1
(R Foundation, Vienna, Austria; http:
//www.r-project.org) or SAS, version 9.1.

RESULTS
Recruitment and Baseline
Characteristics
Study staff screened 7572 potential par-
ticipants and randomized 3107 be-
tween March 1995 and November 30,
2000 (Figure 1). There was no differ-
ence in postrandomization exclusions
by study group (9 vs 10). The final
study sample included 1537 women in
the dietary intervention group and 1551
in the study comparison group.

The study end date was June 1, 2006.
Number and frequency of reported phy-
sician visits did not differ significantly
between groups at any point during the
study. We confirmed vital status on the
study end date (Figure 1) for 95% of
the intervention group and 96% of the
comparison group. Breast cancer sta-
tus was confirmed for 96% of the in-
tervention group and 97% of the com-
parison group.

Randomization achieved highly com-
parable groups (TABLE 1) with regard
to demographics (ie, age, minority sta-
tus, and education), breast cancer char-
acteristics (ie, stage, grade, nodal in-
volvement, hormone receptor status,
time from breast cancer diagnosis to
randomization, and eligibility for
BRCA1/2 testing), and treatment (ie,
surgery and radiation). Slight imbal-
ances were observed between groups in
bilateral oophorectomy, antiestrogen
use, and chemotherapy treatment, all

of which favored an intervention effect;
however, no between-group differ-
ence was observed in the percentage of
women who received at least 1 of these
therapies (intervention, 93.6%; com-
parison, 92.3%; P=.12). Fourteen per-
cent of women self-identified as mi-
nority race/ethnicity, and these were
fairly equally divided among African
Americans, Hispanics, and Asian
Americans.20

Dietary Changes Between Groups
In analyses of dietary change, only par-
ticipants without a study end point at
the time of assessment were included.
A high proportion of women com-
pleted the dietary assessments
(TABLE 2). At baseline, no between-
group differences were observed in in-
takes of vegetables, fruit, or fiber or en-
ergy intake from fat, with both groups
consuming a daily mean of more than
7 servings of vegetables and fruit. No

between-group differences were ob-
served in measured mean body weight
or in energy intake.

In the comparison group, consump-
tion of vegetables, fruit, or fiber changed
only modestly over the 6 years follow-
ing randomization, while relative en-
ergy intake from fat increased 13%, re-
flecting an identified secular trend
( J.P.P., V.A.N., L.N., et al, unpub-
lished data, May 2007). In the inter-
vention group, the dietary pattern
changed substantially and a large
(P ⬍ .001) between-group difference
was achieved and maintained for each
dietary target across the 6 years of the
intervention. From no difference at
baseline, the overall adherence score
was 91% higher in the intervention
group at 6 months and remained 61%
higher than the comparison group at 6
years. Details of changes in dietary tar-
gets are presented elsewhere (J.P.P.,
V.A.N., L.N., et al, unpublished data,

May 2007). Using the more conserva-
tive imputed data approach,27 at 1 year,
the intervention group had increased
average total vegetable and fruit in-
take to 12 servings/d. This change in
total vegetable and fruit intake re-
flected a major increase in vegetable in-
take, averaging 7.8 vegetable serv-
ings/d at 1 year and remaining relatively
high at 6 servings/d at the 4-year
follow-up.

At 4 years, relative differences in
mean intake between study groups were
⫹65% for vegetable servings, ⫹25% for
fruit servings, ⫹30% for fiber, and −13%
for energy intake from fat. All differ-
ences were statistically significant at
P⬍.001. Total plasma carotenoid con-
centration, a biomarker of vegetable and
fruit intake, was 73% higher in the in-
tervention group than the comparison
group at 1 year and 43% higher at 4
years, differences that were statisti-
cally significant (P ⬍ .001). In addi-

resenting 256 participants (16.7%) in
the intervention group and 262 par-
ticipants (16.9%) in the comparison
group. The disease-free survival curves
were virtually identical across groups
(FIGURE 2). The unadjusted hazard ra-
tio is presented in Figure 2. The
hazard ratio after adjustment for anti-
estrogen use, oophorectomy status, and
stratification factors (including tumor
stage, clinic site, and age) at baseline
was 0.96 (95% confidence interval,
0.80-1.14; P=.63). The likelihood ra-
tio test statistics for group interac-
tions with age, body mass index, physi-
cal activity, energy intake, char-
acteristics of the original tumor (in-
cluding hormone receptor status), and
years from diagnosis to study entry were
not significant (TABLE 4). Further-
more, hazard ratios for intervention ef-
fects within covariate strata were not
significant (Table 4).

Overall Mortality
There were 315 deaths reported within
the study period, with 155 (10.1%) in
the intervention group and 160 (10.3%)
in the comparison group (Figure 2).
More than 80% of all deaths were due

to breast cancer (Table 3). The treat-
ment-associated hazard ratio was 0.91
(95% confidence interval, 0.72-1.15;
P=.43) after adjusting for antiestrogen
use, bilateral oophorectomy, and strati-
fication factors. The likelihood ratio test
statistics for the group interactions with
age, body mass index, physical activ-
ity, energy intake, characteristics of the
original tumor (including hormone re-
ceptor status), and years from diagno-
sis to study entry were not statistically
significant, nor were significant effects
of the intervention on mortality ob-
served for any subgroups of women clas-
sified by major covariates (TABLE 5).

Group Effects by Baseline Quartiles
of Dietary Intake
Within each quartile of the targeted di-
etary components, the intervention
group achieved significant change from
baseline (TABLE 6). However, there was
no evidence of a consistent pattern of
an intervention effect for either breast
cancer events or mortality according to
any baseline diet subgroup, and the
findings that are statistically signifi-
cant in 2 of the 40 compared strata are
what one might expect due to chance.

COMMENT
In this randomized trial of a dietary in-
tervention to achieve a substantial change
to a diet very high in vegetables, fruit, and
fiber and low in fat, the risk of develop-
ing additional breast cancer events and
survival were not altered in women pre-
viously treated for early stage disease. No
significant benefit in recurrence was ob-
served overall among population sub-
groups characterized by demographic
characteristics, baseline diet, or initial tu-
mor types. Although breast cancer mor-
tality rates in the United States declined
during the study period,35 the similarity
in survival patterns between the WHEL
Study groups suggests that continued fol-
low-up would not alter the study re-
sults.

It is unlikely that our results were ma-
terially affected by bias in assessing the
main study end points. Follow-up of par-
ticipants was nearly complete and did not
differ between study groups, and we con-
sidered only reports of recurrence and
new primary tumors that were vali-
dated by medical record review. We ob-
served large and sustained between-
group differences in vegetable and fruit
intake, as assessed by self-report and
plasma carotenoid concentrations, a bio-
marker of vegetable and fruit intake. We
also observed significant differences in
fiber and fat intake. Although weight has
been associated with health outcomes,
we observed less than a 1-kg difference
in average weight between WHEL Study
groups at any time point. While psycho-
social factors have been linked with
health outcomes, we found no between-
group differences for depression, social
support, or quality of life during year 1,
when the intervention was most in-
tense.36 Therefore, we believe that our in-
vestigation provides an adequate test of
whether the study dietary pattern (very
high in vegetables, fruit, and fiber and
low in fat) provided an added benefit over
the dietary pattern of the comparison
group women.

Many WHEL Study participants had
likely changed their dietary pattern
since receiving a diagnosis of breast can-
cer37; 75% were consuming at least 5
servings of vegetables and fruit a day

was consuming less than 5 daily serv-
ings of vegetables and fruit at base-
line, despite a major change in dietary
pattern that was specific to the inter-
vention group. Previously, in longitu-
dinal analyses of the comparison group
only, we observed a possible thresh-
old effect on recurrence for low levels
of baseline plasma carotenoid concen-
tration13 and also that a baseline com-
bination of 5 fruits and vegetables a day
and physical activity equivalent to walk-
ing at a moderate pace for 30 minutes,
6 d/wk, was associated with lower mor-
tality.14 However, in this analysis of data
from the randomized trial, a major in-
crease over the 5-a-day dietary pattern
was not associated with reduced breast
cancer events or mortality.

We suggest caution in applying our
findings to groups of women other than
those represented in our study, which
was confined to women who had al-
ready completed initial therapy for
breast cancer and excluded women with
diagnoses after age 70 years and those
with stage 1 tumors smaller than 1 cm.
Also, only 14% of our study popula-
tion was self-identified as from Afri-
can American, Hispanic, and Asian
American racial/ethnic groups.

Our finding that reducing dietary fat
intake did not benefit breast cancer out-
comes appears at odds with the in-
terim analyses from the Women’s In-
tervention Nutrition Study (WINS),
which concluded that reducing di-
etary fat intake was marginally associ-
ated with longer relapse-free survival
of breast cancer patients, an effect most
noted in the subgroup with estrogen-
negative tumors. However, differen-
tial follow-up between intervention and
comparison groups may have influ-
enced the WINS finding.40 Further-
more, the reduced body weight ob-
served only in the intervention group
might partially account for the im-
proved relapse-free survival in WINS.41
In addition, although WINS reported
an 8% to 9% between-group differ-
ence in energy intake from fat main-
tained through 5 years, they reported
a higher rate of missing dietary intake
data in the intervention group. At the

3-year point, data were available for
67% of the intervention group vs 74%
of the comparison group. At 5 years,
data were available for 39% of the in-
tervention group and 44% of the com-
parison group. If even moderate pro-
portions of nonresponders increased
their fat intake, the between-group
effect could well be less than the abso-
lute 4% difference that we observed. Fi-
nally, it is important to note that the
women enrolled in WINS differed from
those in the WHEL trial regarding prog-
nosis following the original diagnosis,
age, and treatment regimen.

Although the WHEL Study’s inter-
vention diet focused mainly on increas-
ing vegetable, fruit, and fiber intake,
there was a significant between-group
difference in fat intake. However, this
difference may not have been sufficient
to test the dietary fat hypothesis ad-
equately. Unlike the changes observed
for intakes of vegetables, fruit and fi-
ber, the smallest dietary fat change was
made by participants in the quartile that
was furthest from the study target at
baseline. Nonetheless, our analyses did
not suggest an effect across quartiles of
fat intake at baseline, nor did our re-
sults indicate an intervention effect in
subgroups defined by hormone recep-
tor status, as was seen in WINS.

The absence of an observed effect on
breast cancer events or all-cause mor-
tality over a 7.3-year follow-up period
in this study does not rule out the pos-
sibility of improved longer-term sur-
vivorship within this cohort. We did not
explore the possibility that increased ex-
ercise and weight loss might benefit
breast cancer survivors. Finally, our
study did not address whether consum-
ing the high–vegetable/fruit/fiber and
low-fat diet of our study intervention
early in life would alter risk of pri-
mary breast cancer.

In conclusion, during a mean 7.3-year
follow-up, we found no evidence that
adoption of a dietary pattern very high
in vegetables, fruit, and fiber and low in
fat vs a 5-a-day fruit and vegetable diet
preventsbreastcancerrecurrenceordeath
among women with previously treated
early stage breast cancer.
