Context Secondary analyses of 2 randomized controlled trials and supportive epi-
demiologic and preclinical data indicated the potential of selenium and vitamin E for
preventing prostate cancer.
Objective To determine whether selenium, vitamin E, or both could prevent pros-
tate cancer and other diseases with little or no toxicity in relatively healthy men.
Design, Setting, and Participants A randomized, placebo-controlled trial (Sele-
nium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial [SELECT]) of 35 533 men from 427 par-
ticipating sites in the United States, Canada, and Puerto Rico randomly assigned to 4
groups (selenium, vitamin E, selenium ⫹ vitamin E, and placebo) in a double-blind
fashion between August 22, 2001, and June 24, 2004. Baseline eligibility included age
50 years or older (African American men) or 55 years or older (all other men), a serum
prostate-specific antigen level of 4 ng/mL or less, and a digital rectal examination not
suspicious for prostate cancer.
Interventions Oral selenium (200 µg/d from L-selenomethionine) and matched vi-
tamin E placebo, vitamin E (400 IU/d of all rac-␣-tocopheryl acetate) and matched
selenium placebo, selenium ⫹ vitamin E, or placebo ⫹ placebo for a planned fol-
low-up of minimum of 7 years and a maximum of 12 years.
Main Outcome Measures Prostate cancer and prespecified secondary outcomes,
including lung, colorectal, and overall primary cancer.
Results As of October 23, 2008, median overall follow-up was 5.46 years (range,
4.17-7.33 years). Hazard ratios (99% confidence intervals [CIs]) for prostate cancer
were 1.13 (99% CI, 0.95-1.35; n=473) for vitamin E, 1.04 (99% CI, 0.87-1.24; n=432)
for selenium, and 1.05 (99% CI, 0.88-1.25; n=437) for selenium ⫹ vitamin E vs 1.00
(n=416) for placebo. There were no significant differences (all P⬎.15) in any other
prespecified cancer end points. There were statistically nonsignificant increased risks
of prostate cancer in the vitamin E group (P=.06) and type 2 diabetes mellitus in the
selenium group (relative risk, 1.07; 99% CI, 0.94-1.22; P=.16) but not in the sele-
nium ⫹ vitamin E group.
Conclusion Selenium or vitamin E, alone or in combination at the doses and formula-
tions used, did not prevent prostate cancer in this population of relatively healthy men.

of cancer death) estimated for 2008.1
An effective prevention strategy for
prostate cancer would have substan-
tial public health benefits, including the
potential to reduce the incidence of bio-
logically indolent prostate cancer,
which is significantly overdetected by
widespread screening with prostate-
specific antigen (PSA) and for which
most newly diagnosed men still un-
dergo curative-intent therapy involv-
ing substantial morbidity despite sur-
gical and other advances.2-6

Important secondary results of 2 ran-
domized controlled trials, the Nutri-
tional Prevention of Cancer (NPC)
study and the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-
Carotene Cancer Prevention (ATBC)
study, showed prostate cancer risk re-
ductions of 63% for selenized yeast and
32% for ␣-tocopherol (or vitamin E).7-10
In addition, a large-scale randomized
controlled trial11 involving several dif-
ferent regimens found that a combina-
tion of selenium, vitamin E, and beta
carotene reduced overall cancer mor-
tality. These clinical data, supported by
epidemiologic and preclinical data,12-19
led to the design of the Selenium and
Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial
(SELECT).20

Investigators in the United States and
Canada from major cooperative groups
of the National Cancer Institute and De-
partment of Veterans Affairs used the
Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial
(PCPT) accrual infrastructure (200
clinical sites, with 18 882 randomized
men) in designing and activating
SELECT. We report herein the effects
of selenium and vitamin E, alone or in
combination, on the risk of prostate
cancer and secondary end points in
SELECT.

METHODS
Study Design
SELECT is a phase 3 randomized, pla-
cebo-controlled trial of selenium (200
µg/d from L-selenomethionine), vita-
min E (400 IU/d of all rac-␣-tocoph-
eryl acetate), or both (planned fol-
low-up of minimum of 7 years and
maximum of 12 years) for prostate can-
cer prevention. The major eligibility re-

quirements included age 50 years or
older for African American men and 55
years or older for all other men, no prior
prostate cancer diagnosis, 4 ng/mL or
less of PSA in serum, and a digital rec-
tal examination (DRE) not suspicious
for cancer. No current use of antico-
agulant therapy other than 175 mg/d or
less of acetylsalicylic acid or 81 mg/d
or less of acetylsalicylic acid with clo-
pidogrel bisulfate, no history of hem-
orrhagic stroke, and normal blood pres-
sure were also required because of
antiplatelet effects of vitamin E and re-
lated findings of the ATBC study.

Participant characteristics were based
onself-report,includingself-identification
of race and ethnicity which were defined
by the US Census Bureau. Race and eth-
nicity data were collected mainly for the
generalizability of trial results. All poten-
tially eligible men were required to pro-
vide written informed consent before
being allowed to participate in the trial.
Thelocalinstitutionalreviewboardofeach
study site approved the study for activa-
tion and reviewed its progress annually.
The trial was activated in July 2001 and
follow-upblindedtothetrialresultsended
on October 23, 2008.

Baseline blood and toenail speci-
mens and a 5-year blood sample were
collected for future biological studies.
Prostate tissue samples collected dur-
ing the trial were submitted for confir-
mation by central pathology review (no
samples were collected at baseline). Par-
ticipants without prostate cancer had
clinic visits once every 6 months
throughout the trial; with prostate can-
cer, annually. Adherence and adverse
events were monitored every 6 months
and a limited physical examination in-
cluding assessments of blood pres-
sure, weight, and smoking status was
conducted annually. Prespecified ad-
verse events known to be associated
with vitamin E or selenium were graded
according to the National Cancer In-
stitute Common Toxicity Criteria.

Although eligible PSA and DRE re-
sults were required at study entry, an-
nual prostate cancer screening with PSA
and DRE was not mandatory because
the benefits of this screening were un-

der debate when the trial opened and
community screening standards were
expected to change during the trial. Par-
ticipants were recommended during an-
nual clinic visits to undergo a PSA test
and DRE according to the standard of
care at their study sites and the partici-
pant’s preferences. A formal preran-
domization period (28-90 days; no pla-
cebo run-in capsules) gave potential
participants time to decide if they would
agree to stop disallowed over-the-
counter supplements of selenium or vi-
tamin E throughout the study and to
demonstrate, by returning for random-
ization, their willingness to adhere to
the trial. Other adherence methods in-
cluded offering each participant a free
multivitamin containing no selenium
or vitamin E and assessing serum lev-
els of vitamin E and selenium in all par-
ticipants at a subset of study sites (22
sites representing 7.8% of the trial
population). These sites were chosen
a priori to be representative of the broad
range of sites in the trial.

End Point Assessment
Participants reported prostate cancers
to the study site staff. Study staff ob-
tained medical records supporting the
diagnosis and abstracted the diagnos-
tic method and clinical stage. Tissue and
the corresponding pathology report
were sent to the central pathology labo-
ratory for confirmation. Gleason Score
was based on central pathology review.
Men were asked at their first 6-month
clinic visit to report new events since
entering the trial and thereafter to re-
port new events since their last visit.
Cardiac-event data were collected in de-
tail from the trial beginning (2001); data
on diabetes were added through self-
reported glitazone medication use (be-
ginning in 2003) and self-report of dia-
betes (beginning in 2005) via the
following question at each clinic visit:
“Does the participant report having dia-
betes (either his doctor told him he has
diabetes or he is taking medication for
diabetes)?”

A general question regarding any
events considered severe or life-
threatening (grade 3 or 4), regardless

of attribution to the study supple-
ments, was also asked. A Social Secu-
rity Death Index search was con-
ducted in July 2008 for participants who
had a last contact date of more than 18
months before the search. Other spe-
cifically queried events (known at study
inception to be related to either of the
study supplements) included alope-
cia, dermatitis, fatigue, halitosis, nail
changes, and nausea.

Statistical Analysis
The primary end point was prostate can-
cer incidence as determined by routine
clinical management. Cancers that were
not confirmed centrally were included
in the analysis. SELECT was designed as
a 4 group trial with 5 prespecified com-
parisons (selenium vs placebo, vitamin
E vs placebo, selenium ⫹ vitamin E vs
placebo, selenium vs selenium ⫹ vita-
min E, and vitamin E vs selenium ⫹ vi-
tamin E). With a sample size of 32 400
men, using a 1-sided ␣=.005 level
(equivalent to a 2-sided ␣=.01 level),
there was 96% power to detect a 25% re-

duction in prostate cancer for either of
the single agents (vs placebo), 89% power
to detect a 25% reduction for selenium
⫹ vitamin E (vs an active single agent)
and more than 99% power to detect a
44% reduction of selenium ⫹ vitamin E
(vs placebo).

Design assumptions were based on
the PCPT, ATBC, and NPC trials.
The details of the statistical design
have been described elsewhere.20
Important elements included (1)
constant accrual over 5 years; (2)
prostate cancer incidence in the pla-
cebo group based on PCPT for the
first 3 years and the 1995 Puget
Sound SEER registry afterward; (3)
adherence to the study supplements,
which was assumed to decrease over
the course of the trial with a 5-year
rate of 68% and 12-year rate of 51%;
(4) a constant 10% drop-in rate,
defined as participants receiving pla-
cebo who are taking active supple-
mentation off-study; (5) loss to
follow-up of 0.5% per year; and (6)
deaths estimated from PCPT for

years 1 to 3 and from the 1995 US
standard rates of men aged 63 years
and all races for year 4 onward. The
sample size was calculated to be
32 400 men and the number of pros-
tate cancers expected in the placebo
group was 533 over 12 years. Under
the assumed conditions, the required
median time under observation was
estimated to be 8.8 years.

The primary analysis consisted of the
5 prespecified comparisons detailed
above. These comparisons allowed for
a meaningful analysis of the study re-
sults whether an interaction between vi-
tamin E and selenium occurred. Each
individual test was conducted at a
1-sided ␣=.005 level (equivalent to a
2-sided ␣=.01 level) using a Bonfer-
roni factor of 5 to preserve an overall
1-sided ␣=.0025 level (equivalent to a
2-sided ␣=.05 level).

An independent data and safety
monitoring committee met yearly and
reviewed data on safety, adherence, and
diagnosis of prostate cancer. In addi-
tion to the final analysis, interim analy-

ses were planned for years 5, 7, 9, 10,
and 11 after the first participant was
randomized; the percentages of the ex-
pected total number of prostate can-
cer events in the placebo group at each
interval were 14%, 35%, 61%, 74%, and
88%, respectively. Each interim analy-
sis resulted in recommendations that
could have included modifications to
the study, including termination of ac-
crual, modifications to data collec-
tion, or early reporting of results. Rec-
ommendations were made to the
steering committee, which made the fi-
nal decisions.

The interim analyses tested the null
hypothesis at a 1-sided ␣=.0005 level
(equivalent to a 2-sided ␣=.001 level)

using the Cox proportional hazards re-
gression model. In addition, the alter-
native hypothesis of a 25% reduction in
prostate cancer incidence was tested at
a 1-sided level of ␣=.0005 (equivalent to
a 2-sided ␣=.001 level) using an exten-
sion of the Cox proportional hazards re-
gression model that allows for testing a
relative risk (RR) not equal to 1. The pur-
pose of the second analysis was to al-
low for the study to stop if it was deter-
mined that the expected reduction in
prostate cancer would not be observed.
The frequencies of the number of car-
diovascular events and cases of diabe-
tes were tested with a ␹2 test. For car-
diovascular event and diabetes analyses,
we did not capture the report of the date

of the event, which thus was not incor-
porated into the analysis.

Participants were randomized in a
randomized block scheme, in which
the block was the study site. This
ensured a balance of the 4 interven-
tion groups within each study site. All
analyses were performed by using an
intention-to-treat analysis in which
men were classified according to the
group to which they were random-
ized. All men were followed up until
death or loss to follow-up. For cancer
end points, men were censored at the
time of their last follow-up or death.
The analysis did not incorporate
adjustments for baseline covariates.
Data were analyzed by using SAS ver-

Supplement Quality Control
and Quality Assurance
The Pharmacy Coordinating Center
received the study supplements for
bottling as finished capsules in
shipments containing lots of ac-
tive capsules along with the ap-
propriate matching placebo. As
required by current good manufac-
turing practice,21 each lot of capsules
was quarantined upon receipt until
testing was performed to ensure that
capsules labeled “active” by the

manufacturer contained the ap-
propriate active agent and that cap-
sules labeled as “placebo” did
not contain an active agent. In addi-
tion, each time the capsules were
bottled, production-run-verification
testing was performed to ensure that
bottles labeled as an active agent or
placebo contained the appropriate
material. To ensure that the quality
of the blind was maintained, cap-
sules received in each subsequent
lot were compared with the previous
lot and with matching capsules in
the current shipment for their char-
acteristics of weight, shape and size,

color and external marking, odor,
and comparability of contents of
opened capsules. Whether the par-
ticipant guessed or had an external
validation of whether he was getting
the active agent or placebo was not
assessed.

RESULTS
On September 15, 2008, the indepen-
dent data and safety monitoring com-
mittee met, reviewed data as of August
1, 2008, for the second formal interim
analysis, and recommended the discon-
tinuation of study supplements be-

2001, and June 24, 2004. FIGURE 1
shows the SELECT randomization
scheme including participants who
were excluded from analyses; all 621
participants at 2 study sites were re-
moved from the analysis because of se-
vere problems that were detected early
on including poor data and partici-
pant management and regulatory is-
sues. These participants differed sub-
stantially from the rest of the SELECT
population in being from sites in the
south of the United States, 99% Afri-
can American, younger (median age 57
years), and of a lower education level
(67% had ⬍high school education), and
in having lower PSA levels (57% had
⬍1.0 ng/mL) and a higher prevalence
of current smokers (33%). An addi-
tional 9 participants were removed be-
cause they were found to have had pros-
tate cancer at randomization and 15
were removed because their informed
consent was never received. More men
were accrued (35 533 in 3 years) than
initially planned (32 400 in 5 years)
mainly because of a faster-than-
expected accrual rate and the admin-
istrative time it takes to close down
accrual.

The baseline characteristics of
SELECT participants by each of the 4
groups (placebo, vitamin E, selenium,
and selenium ⫹ vitamin E) are shown
in TABLE 1. All potentially important
risk factors were well balanced among
the groups. A total of 2.6% of SELECT
men were former PCPT men random-
ized to finasteride; during the trial,
4.8% of the non-PCPT participants
reported use of finasteride at 5 mg
(n=1602) or 1 mg (n=86).

The median overall follow-up was
5.46 years (range, 4.17-7.33 years). The
percentages of participants with a re-
cent last-contact date were more than
88% within 7 months and 92% within
13 months of the SELECT data analy-
sis. Loss to follow-up, defined as hav-
ing a last contact date of more than 24
months before analysis, involved 5.1%
of participants, which was higher than
had been estimated for the trial design
(3.5% at 7 years after trial activation).

Compared with placebo, there was a statistically nonsignificant increase in prostate cancer in the vitamin E
group (P=.06) and not in the selenium ⫹ vitamin E group (P=.52) or the selenium group (P=.62).

Adherence to both study agents as de-
termined by pill count was similar across
all study groups, and averaged 83% at
year 1 and 65% at year 5. Adherence to
at least 1 of the 2 agents was 87% at year
1 and 72% at year 5 (the design-
estimated adherence rates were 90% at
year 1 and 68% at year 5). Bioadher-
ence was measured in a subset of par-
ticipants by serum levels of selenium and
cholesterol-adjusted ␣-tocopherol and ␥-
tocopherol (which is suppressed by ␣-
tocopherol) and showed a good separa-
tion in agent serum levels between the
groups (TABLE 2). The drop-in rate was
assessed by a direct question to the par-
ticipants about taking either of the
supplements. Positive responses were
3.1% or less for vitamin E and 1.8% or
less for selenium in each year (below the
design drop-in estimate of 10%). Pros-
tate tissue samples were sent to the cen-
tral pathology laboratory for confirma-
tion in 86% of cases. The central
laboratory agreed with the clinical site’s
prostate cancer diagnosis in 99% of these
cases.

Prostate Cancer
There were no statistically significant dif-
ferences in the rates of prostate cancer
between the 4 groups (placebo, 416 cases
[5-year rate of 4.43%]; selenium, 432

cases [4.56%]; vitamin E, 473 cases
[4.93%]; selenium ⫹ vitamin E, 437
cases [4.56%]) (TABLE 3 and FIGURE 2).
Compared with placebo, the hazard ra-
tios (HRs) for prostate cancer were 1.13
(99% confidence interval [CI], 0.95-
1.35; 95% CI, 0.99-1.29; P=.06) in the
vitamin E-alone group, 1.05 (99% CI,
0.88-1.25; 95% CI, 0.91-1.20; P=.52)
in the selenium ⫹ vitamin E group, and
1.04 (99% CI, 0.87-1.24; 95% CI, 0.90-
1.18; P = .62) in the selenium-alone
group. The data and safety monitor-
ing committee had some concern over
the statistically nonsignificant in-
crease in prostate cancer in the vita-
min E-alone group (P=.09 per interim
data of August 1, 2008) and over a non-
significant increase in diabetes melli-
tus associated with selenium (P=.08 per
interim data of August 1, 2008).

The majority of prostate cancers di-
agnosed during the trial were early-
stage and low-grade, and cancer stage
and grade were similar across all groups
(Table 3). The percentage of patients
who had an annual PSA examination
and DRE was similarly high and the bi-
opsy rate was similar across all groups,
indicating that the prostate cancer find-
ings were not due to screening-
associated detection bias. More than
95% of prostate cancers were diag-

nosed by biopsy, the triggers for which
(based on PSA and other factors) are
shown in Table 3 and were similar
across all groups. The number of pros-
tate cancers in the placebo cohort was
higher than what was estimated at study
inception. This was due to the faster
than expected accrual, the larger than
expected sample size, and higher base-
line PSA levels than anticipated.

Secondary Outcomes
There were no significant differences
(all P⬎.15) in any prespecified second-
ary cancer end points (FIGURE 3 and
TABLE 4). At 5 years, the cumulative

death rate in the placebo group was 38
deaths per 1000 participants (95% CI,
34 deaths per 1000 participants to 42
deaths per 1000 participants); the es-
timated rate at trial inception was 48
deaths per 1000 participants. The num-
bers of deaths from any cause were simi-
lar across the 4 groups (382 in pla-
cebo group, 358 in vitamin E group,
378 in selenium group, and 359 in se-
lenium ⫹ vitamin E group).

The study agents had no significant
effects on the overall incidence of car-
diovascular events (Table 4). A statis-
tically nonsignificant increase in type
2 diabetes mellitus (diagnosed after ran-

domization) occurred in the selenium-
alone group vs placebo group (n=724;
10.0%; 99% CI, 9.1%-11.0%; vs n=669;
9.3%; 99% CI, 8.5%-10.2%, respec-
tively; RR, 1.07; 99% CI, 0.94-1.22;
P=.16). The number (percentage) of
cases of diabetes mellitus was 700
(9.7%; 99% CI, 8.8%-10.6%) in the vi-
tamin E group and 660 (9.1%; 99% CI,
8.2%-10.0%) in the selenium ⫹ vita-
min E group (P values of these data
compared with placebo were 0.47 for
vitamin E and 0.61 for selenium ⫹ vi-
tamin E). Data on known, clinically less
significant adverse effects of the study

COMMENT
In SELECT, neither 200 µg of selenome-
thionine or 400 IU of synthetic DL ␣-
tocopherol,givenorallyaloneorcombined
for a median of 5.5 years had significant
effects on the primary or secondary end
points. A statistically nonsignificant in-
creased incidence of prostate cancer
(P=.06) was observed in the vitamin E
group but not in the selenium ⫹ vitamin
E group. The trial supplements were dis-

continued early (in year 7 of the overall
12-yearstudy)inaccordancewithaunani-
mous recommendation of the data and

no evidence of a benefit from either study
agent and no possibility of a benefit to

supplement adherence and drop-in
rates, prostate cancer incidence, death

rate, and loss to follow-up were largely
met and gave the trial significant power
to detect the estimated preventive ef-
fects. Furthermore, the large sample
size, inclusion of a substantial propor-
tion of non-white men, and equal dis-
tribution of known risk factors across
all trial groups make the conclusions
drawn from SELECT especially ro-
bust and generalizable.

limitations inherent in secondary analy-
ses, such as chance findings due to mul-
tiple testing, especially because the over-
all NPC sample size was relatively small
(1312 men and women vs 29 133 men
in the ATBC study). Second, the formu-
lation (high-selenium yeast) given in the
NPC trial may have been more active
than the l-selenomethionine given in
SELECT (both trials gave an equivalent
selenium dose). In designing SELECT,
we carefully evaluated the choice of l-
selenomethionine vs high-selenium yeast
(and other formulations),20 and our ra-
tionale for selecting l-selenomethio-
nine included the following consider-
ations: selenomethionine was the major
component of apparently active high-
selenium yeast; evidence indicated sub-
stantial batch-to-batch variations in spe-
cific organoselenium compounds in
samples of NPC yeast, making it un-
likely that we could duplicate the sele-
nium yeast formulation used in the NPC
study; potential genotoxicity of highly ac-
tive inorganic selenium compounds,
such as selenite, made them potentially
unsuitable for long-term prevention; low-
ering (vs selenomethionine) of overall
body selenium stores with selenite, which
is neither absorbed nor retained well;
practical and safety concerns over newer
selenium compounds, such as mono-
methylated forms (eg, lacking availabil-

ity, investigational new drug certifica-
tion, and clinical data); and in vitro data
indicating that selenomethionine was ef-
fective in suppressing malignant and not
normal prostate cells.15

Despite this careful rationale, it is im-
possible to know now whether sele-
nized yeast would have been more ac-
tive than l-selenomethionine was in
SELECT. Finally, the NPC trial was con-
ducted in men chosen for deficient lev-
els of selenium, finding that selenium was
most preventive in the men with the low-
est baseline selenium levels9; SELECT
men generally were replete in selenium
at baseline, with median serum sele-
nium levels of 135 ng/mL vs 113 ng/mL
in NPC. The NPC cutpoint for the low-
est 2 tertiles was 121.6 units; 78% of
SELECT men were above this level. The
NPC trial found a nonsignificant in-
crease in overall cancer rate in its high-
est tertile (HR, 1.20; 95% CI, 0.77-1.86).22
There are potential reasons why vita-
min E did not prevent prostate cancer in
SELECT. First, the high dose (400 IU/d)
of the ␣-tocopherol form of vitamin E in
SELECT may have been less effective
than a lower dose such as the 8-fold lower
50 mg/d (roughly equivalent to 50 IU/d)
that produced the earlier positive sec-
ondary findings in the ATBC study.7 (The
vitamin E formulation, synthetic all rac-
␣-tocopheryl acetate, was the same in

SELECT and the ATBC study.) A sec-
ondary analysis of the HOPE trial23 found
that a relatively high dose of natural vi-
tamin E did not reduce prostate cancer
incidence. Achieving higher plasma or
tissue levels of ␣-tocopherol within the
physiological range, such as through a
50-mg/d supplement, may have some
prostate cancer (or other) preventive
effect such as cell proliferation or tu-
mor growth inhibition.24 Furthermore,
high pharmacological doses of ␣-
tocopherol may have an adverse effect on
cytochrome p450 enzyme and other
regulatory mechanisms25 that a lower
dose would not have. It is also possible
(but not certain) that the known effect
of ␣-tocopherol in suppressing poten-
tially beneficial plasma ␥-tocopherol lev-
els would have been less with the lower
than higher dose of ␣-tocopherol.20 Nev-
ertheless, men taking vitamin E with the
highest baseline (and thus total) serum
vitamin E levels in the ATBC study had
the highest reduction in prostate and
lung cancer,26 which supported our
choice of the higher dose. A higher dose
also was associated with potential ben-
efits such as reductions in aging-related
Alzheimer disease and macular degen-
eration.

Second, several studies have sug-
gested that vitamin E is more protective
against prostate cancer in smokers, and

rent or former smokers (whereas all men
in the ATBC study were smokers). For
example, observational analyses in a trial-
based cohort of the Prostate, Lung, Co-
lorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening
Trial (PLCO),27 a trial of screening vs
standard health care routines, showed a
71% reduction in the incidence of ad-
vanced prostate cancer associated with
supplemental vitamin E use in current
and recent smokers. A subgroup analy-
sis of current and former smokers in
SELECT, however, did not show a smok-
ing-related benefit (placebo, 4.6% [223/
4863] vs vitamin E alone, 4.8% [232/
4853]). As with selenium in the NPC
study, vitamin E effects on prostate can-
cer incidence in the ATBC study could
have been due to chance findings in sec-
ondary analyses.

Selenium was not associated with sig-
nificant effects on cardiovascular events,
lung cancer, other cancers, or overall
mortality in SELECT. One safety con-
cern with selenium is a potential asso-
ciation with increased risk for type 2
diabetes mellitus, for which there are
mixed data from prior studies.28,29 A re-
cent analysis of the NPC study popu-
lation showed a significant increase in
type 2 diabetes mellitus (by self-
report and medical records), largely lim-
ited to the top tertile of plasma sele-
nium levels at baseline.30

In SELECT, a nonsignificant in-
crease in risk (RR, 1.07; P=.16) of dia-
betes mellitus compared with placebo
was observed in the selenium group but
not in the selenium ⫹ vitamin E group
(RR, 0.97; P=.62). Concerns about the
safety of vitamin E supplementation
arose during SELECT. One meta-
analysis31 found that vitamin E at doses
of at least 400 IU/d increased all-cause
mortality, and another study32 found evi-
dence that vitamin E supplementation,
alone or in combination with other an-
tioxidants, may increase mortality. Nei-
ther study is directly relevant to the doses
and population studied in SELECT;
many studies included in these meta-
analyses were in patients with serious dis-
ease, and the finding of increased mor-
tality was driven by studies using doses

SELENIUM AND VITAMIN E FOR CANCER PREVENTION

far higher than 400 IU/d. In more rel-
evant, placebo-controlled trials com-
pleted in healthy men and women, there
were no associations of vitamin E supple-
mentation with increased risks of either
cardiovascular disease or overall mor-
tality.33 SELECT results support the
safety of vitamin E at 400 IU/d in healthy
men, because there were no increases in
either cardiovascular disease or total mor-
tality in the vitamin E groups.

The 35 533 randomized men of
SELECT were needed because of the ro-
bust statistical design accommodating 4
study groups with 5 primary compari-
sons; this large trial population made
SELECT the largest cancer chemopre-
vention trial ever conducted to our
knowledge. African American men have
among the highest prostate cancer risks
in the world, and SELECT had the high-
est participation of African American
men (13%) of any large-scale cancer che-
moprevention trial to date.

The statistical rigor of the trial was
matched by the rigor of its implementa-
tion. Features of this implementation in-
cluded the SELECT Workbench, a se-
cure Web site administered by the
SELECT statistical center and used by
study-site staff and investigators. The
SELECT Workbench was used to ac-
cess participant and site-specific re-
ports, the study protocol, and a detailed
study manual and to submit data using
Web-based forms. Form submission in-
cluded detailed edit checks and a track-
ing system to identify all expected forms.
Training and monitoring consisted of
semi-annual workshops, quality assur-
ance audits at least once every 3 years,
and mentoring by trained statistical cen-
ter staff and experienced clinical re-
search associates. SELECT also main-
tained a public Web site initially designed
to recruit participants and later used to
promote participant adherence and to
keep SELECT in the public’s eye.20

Potential limitations of SELECT in-
clude that it did not test different for-
mulations or doses of selenium and vi-
tamin E and that it did not definitively
assess results in subgroups of men who
may have responded differently than did
the overall population. Because of ac-

tive annual screening (eg, PSA in 85%;
Table 3) and early detection (eg, 99.4%
stage T1 or T2; Table 3), SELECT could
not assess effects in reducing advanced
or fatal prostate cancer, which recent data
suggest may be a potential benefit of vi-
tamin E and selenium.18,27,34-36 SELECT
also could not assess intervention ef-
fects in a population deficient in vita-
min E, selenium, or both since our trial
population was well-nourished at base-
line, or in current smokers since they rep-
resented only 7.5% of the SELECT popu-
lation, a substantial difference from the
ATBC study in predominantly heavy
smokers.

Cancer chemoprevention is an im-
portant approach for reducing cancer
burden.37 Several randomized con-
trolled trials have demonstrated sig-
nificant cancer or premalignancy risk
reductions in the breast, colon-
rectum, prostate, and stomach.38-44 Pros-
tate cancer is a particularly attractive
target for chemoprevention because of
its clinical ubiquity, substantial treat-
ment-associated morbidity, and step-
wise molecular pathogenesis. In the
large-scale PCPT, which was reported
2 years after SELECT was activated, fi-
nasteride produced a 25% relative re-
duction in the 7-year period preva-
lence of prostate cancer (vs placebo),43
and recent data suggest that finaste-
ride reduces the risk of clinically sig-
nificant disease and may not induce
high-grade cancers despite initial con-
cerns to the contrary.45-49

CONCLUSION
In conclusion, SELECT has definitively
demonstrated that selenium, vitamin E,
or selenium ⫹ vitamin E (at the tested
doses and formulations) did not pre-
vent prostate cancer in the generally
healthy, heterogeneous population of
men in SELECT. These data under-
score the prudence that is needed in con-
sidering recommendations to use agents
for the prevention or control of disease
in the absence of convincing clinical trial
results. These findings also compel the
medical research community to con-
tinue the search for new, effective agents
for prostate cancer prevention.
