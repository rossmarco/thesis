Review

Several epidemiological investigations have been conducted to evaluate the relationship
between dietary cholesterol
intake and risk of breast cancer, but the results are
inconsistent. This meta-analysis was performed to summarize the evidence from
observational studies to test the hypothesis that dietary cholesterol intake increases the
risk of breast cancer. PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and China National Knowledge
Infrastructure were searched for relevant articles published up to July 2015. Pooled relative
risks were calculated with random effects model. Dose-response relationship was assessed
by restricted cubic spline model. Overall, 9 articles involving 6 cohort studies and 3 case-
control studies were included in this study. The pooled relative risk with 95% confidence
intervals of breast cancer for the highest vs lowest category of dietary cholesterol intake
was 1.29 (1.06-1.56). For dose-response analysis, a nonlinear relationship was found
between dietary cholesterol and breast cancer, and the association became statistically
significant when the cholesterol intake was greater than 370 mg/d. Results from this meta-
analysis indicated that dietary cholesterol was associated with an increased risk of
breast cancer.

Introduction

Breast cancer is the second most common cancer in women
worldwide, with about 1.7 million new cases diagnosed yearly,
and remains the leading cause of cancer death among women
in both the developed and developing world. Reproductive,
hormonal factors and unhealthy lifestyles are considered as
risk factors of breast cancer [1]. Furthermore, observational
studies have indicated that obesity, as a potentially modifiable

risk factor, could increase the risk of breast cancer in women
[2–4]. Because obesity is primarily diet induced and a comor-
bidity of hypercholesterolemia, a Western diet which is rich in
fat and cholesterol may increase the risk of breast cancer [5,6].
Since the 1980s, many epidemiological studies have investigat-
ed the relation of high-fat/high-cholesterol diet and the risk of
breast cancer. Although a pooled analysis of 7 cohort studies in
1996 showed no evidence of an association between total
dietary cholesterol intake and the risk of breast cancer, recent

studies from animal models found a link between high-fat/
high-cholesterol diet and the development of breast cancer
[7–9], and results from in vitro and in vivo studies indicated that
27-hydroxycholesterol (27HC), a cholesterol metabolite, could
induce breast cancer [10]. However, recent epidemiologic
evidence from cohort studies [11,12] and case-control studies
[13–15] are inconsistent. In addition, the dose-response rela-
tionship of fat and cholesterol with breast cancer, which is the
strong evidence for a causal relationship, is unknown.

To our best knowledge, no meta-analysis of dietary
cholesterol intake and breast cancer has been published.
Therefore, we reviewed observational studies including co-
hort studies [11,12,16–19] and case-control studies [13–15] to
(1) first assess the breast cancer risk for the highest vs lowest
dietary cholesterol consumption and then explore the poten-
tial dose-response relationship,
(2) assess the potential
between-study heterogeneity, and (3) investigate the poten-
tial publication bias. The hypothesis that dietary cholesterol
intake could increase the risk of breast cancer was tested in

this study. The findings of the study might be meaningful for
the possible prevention of breast cancer.

Literature search strategy

A comprehensive literature search up to July 2015 was
performed for pertinent available articles from the
following databases: PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science,
and China National Knowledge Infrastructure. The fol-
lowing search terms were used without
limitations:
breast cancer OR breast neoplasm OR breast carcinoma OR
breast tumor and dietary cholesterol OR cholesterol intake OR
cholesterol consumption OR fat intake. Moreover, we also
reviewed the reference lists of reviews and relevant
articles to identify additional studies not captured by
our database searches.

the study was performed, RRs (we presented all results as RR
for simplicity) with corresponding 95% CIs for the highest vs
lowest categories of dietary cholesterol, the cut points for
cholesterol exposure, and variables adjusted for in the
analysis. The RRs adjusted for most of confounding factors
were extracted. The Newcastle-Ottawa quality assessment
scale was used to assess the quality of the original studies.

2.4.

Statistical analyses

Pooled RRs were calculated as the inverse variance-weighted
means of the logarithm of RRs with corresponding 95% CIs to
assess the strength of
the association between dietary
cholesterol and breast cancer risk. The I2 of Higgins and
Thompson was used to assess between-study heterogeneity
[20]. The random-effect model was used as the pooling
method. Meta-regression was conducted to assess the poten-
tially important covariates that may exert substantial impact

on between-study heterogeneity [21]. “Leave one out” analysis
[22] was conducted using I2> 50% as the criterion to evaluate
the influence of the key study on between-study heterogene-
ity. Influence analysis was performed with 1 study removed
at a time to evaluate whether the results could have been
affected markedly by a single study. Publication bias was
evaluated using the Egger [23] regression asymmetry test and
the funnel plot. Subgroup analyses were performed by study
design (cohort study or case-control study) and menstrual
status (premenopausal or postmenopausal). The power (1 − β)
of the pooled RR was calculated using the sample size,
incidence of control group, the pooled RR, and the fixed α (α=
.05), and the incidence was obtained from the study with the
smallest incidence of control group.

For dose-response analysis, a 2-stage random-effects
dose-response meta-analysis was performed to compute the
trend from the correlated log RR estimates across levels of
dietary cholesterol [24]. In the first stage, a restricted cubic
spline model with 3 knots at the 10th, 50th, and 90th centiles

[25] of the levels of cholesterol consumption was estimated
using generalized least square regression, taking into account
the relationship within each set of published RRs. Then the
restricted maximum likelihood method was used in a
multivariate random-effects meta-analysis to combine the
study specific estimates [26]. A P value for nonlinearity was
calculated by testing the null hypothesis that the coefficient
of the second spline is equal to 0.

All statistical analyses were performed using STATA
version 12.0 (Stata Corporation, College Station, TX, USA). All
reported probabilities (P values) were 2-sided with a statistical
significance level of .05.

Characteristics of studies

The detailed steps of the literature search are shown in Fig. 1. A
total of 9 studies from 9 articles [11–19]
including 387,069
participants and 8668 cases were included in this meta-
analysis. The characteristics of the 9 included studies are
shown in Table 1. There are 6 cohort studies with 377,909
participants, and the follow-up duration ranged from 3 to 20
years. Three studies with 9160 participants were case-control
design. Most of the studies were conducted in Europe and United
States. The quality assessment showed that the Newcastle-
Ottawa score of each study was not less than 7, indicating that
the methodological quality was generally good (Table 2).

3.2.

Quantitative synthesis

lowest dose of cholesterol ranged from 80 to 247 mg/d, and
the median dose was 138 mg/d. For the highest vs lowest
cholesterol consumption, data from 9 studies [11–19] includ-
ing 8668 breast cancer cases were used, and the pooled RR of
all included studies was 1.29 (95% CI, 1.06-1.56; I2= 71.3%,
Pheterogeneity= .001) (Fig. 2). The power (1 − β) of the pooled RR is
higher than 99%.

In subgroup analysis by study design, data from 6 studies
[11,12,16–19] including 5442 breast cancer cases for cohort
studies and 3 studies [13–15] including 3226 breast cancer
cases for case-control studies were used. The pooled RR was
1.07 (95% CI, 0.98-1.17; I2= 5.8%, Pheterogeneity= .380) for cohort
studies and 2.12 (95% CI, 1.17-3.84; I2= 75.6%, Pheterogeneity=
.016) for case-control studies (Fig. 3), respectively.

In subgroup analysis by menstrual status, there were 3
including 6631 breast cancer cases for
studies [12,15,27]
premenopausal woman and 4 studies [12,15,18,27] including
7090 breast cancer cases for postmenopausal woman. The
pooled RR was 1.24 (95% CI, 1.05-1.47; I2= 0.0%, Pheterogeneity=
.736) for premenopausal women and 1.12 (95% CI, 0.91-1.39; I2=
50.6%, Pheterogeneity= .108) for postmenopausal women (Fig. 4).

In dose-response analysis, data from 3 studies [13,14,18]
were adopted. Evidence of a nonlinear association was
found (Pnonlinearity= .0003) between dietary cholesterol and
risk of breast cancer. The association became significant
when the cholesterol consumption was greater than 370
mg/d. The RRs with 95% CIs of breast cancer risk were 1.00
(95% CI, 0.95-1.05), 1.06 (95% CI, 0.95-1.07), 1.18 (95% CI, 1.04-
1.34), 1.27 (95% CI, 1.10-1.45), and 1.70 (95% CI, 1.34-2.16) for
201, 315, 370, 394, and 480 mg/d of cholesterol consump-
tion, respectively (Fig. 5).

with breast cancer. However, univariate meta-regression
analysis showed that no covariates of age, location, and
study design had a significant impact on between-study
heterogeneity. The “leave one out” sensitivity analysis indi-
cated that the study conducted by De Stefani et al
[14]
contributed to the between-study heterogeneity. After ex-
cluding the article, low heterogeneity (I2= 50.0%, Pheterogeneity=
.051) (Fig. 6) was found, and the pooled RR was 1.18 (95% CI,
1.02-1.36). No individual study was found to have an excessive
influence on the pooled effect in influence analysis (Fig. 7).

Publication bias

3.2.3.
The visual inspection of the funnel plot (Fig. 8) and Egger test
(P= .084) showed no evidence of publication bias for all
included studies on the association between dietary choles-
terol and the risk of breast cancer.

Discussion

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis to
examine the association between dietary cholesterol and
breast cancer risk. The results were consistent with our
hypothesis that high cholesterol intake could increase the
risk of breast cancer. The pooled RR with 95% CI of breast
cancer for the highest vs lowest category of dietary choles-
terol was 1.29 (1.06-1.56). A significant positive association
was observed in the subgroup of case-control studies (2.12
[1.17-3.84]), and a marginally significant association was
found in subgroup of cohort studies (1.07 [0.98-1.17]). In
premenopausal women, the pooled RR was 1. 24 (95% CI,
1.05-1.47; I2= 0.0%, Pheterogeneity= .736); and in postmenopausal
women, the pooled RR was 1.12 (95% CI, 0.91-1.39; I2= 50.6%,

that 27HC, a metabolite of cholesterol, can function as an
estrogen and increase the proliferation of estrogen receptor–
positive breast cancer cells. With mouse model, McDonnell's
team also found that mice on a high-cholesterol diet showed
high blood cholesterol and then high blood 27HC, and they had
a 30% larger tumor after 15 days than mice on a control diet. The
findings may explain the mechanism that links high blood
levels of cholesterol and breast cancer pathogenesis. The serum
level of cholesterol is closely related to biosynthesis. But some
studies indicated that elevated dietary cholesterol consump-
tion could increase the serum level of cholesterol [31]. And a
meta-analysis published in 2015 showed that elevated serum
level of cholesterol may be associated with the risk of breast
cancer [32]. So it is recognized that dietary cholesterol intake
may increase risk of breast cancer.

Between-study heterogeneity is common in meta-analysis. It
is necessary to detect the potential sources of between-study
heterogeneity. Thus, we used both meta-regression and the
“leave one out” sensitive analysis to explore the potential sources
of the between study heterogeneity. Characteristics such as
publication year, sample size, and study design might be the
sources of between-study heterogeneity. We found that no
covariates of age, publication year, sample size, study design, or
measurements of cholesterol exposure were important contrib-
utors to the between-study heterogeneity. For analysis between
the risk of breast cancer and dietary cholesterol, 1 study [14] was
found to be the key contributor to this moderate between-study
heterogeneity by the “leave one out” sensitivity analysis. After
further excluding this article, no significant between-study
heterogeneity (I2= 50.0%, Pheterogeneity= .051) was found. Although
the pooled RR was modestly attenuated, the result revealed no
substantial change compared to the one based on all studies,
indicating that our results were stable and reliable.

Our study had several strengths. First, our study included a
large number of participants, reducing sampling error to a great

lesterol and breast cancer risk. The solid line and the long

Pheterogeneity= .108). The result showed no association between
dietary cholesterol and breast cancer in postmenopausal
women, and it might be caused by the limited number of
cohort studies. For dose-response analysis, a nonlinear
association was found between dietary cholesterol and breast
cancer, and the association became significant when the
cholesterol consumption was greater than 370 mg/d.

Epidemiological evidence indicates that elevated cholester-
ol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and very low-density
lipoprotein cholesterol are comorbidities of obesity and may be
independent risk factors of breast cancer [28,29].However,
robust mechanisms behind these observations are absent.
Recently, McDonnell's team and Shaul's team [10,30] reported

Fig. 6 – “Leave one out” analysis of dietary cholesterol and risk of breast cancer in which the pooled RR is reestimated after
removing 1 study that had a strong effect on between-study heterogeneity.

control studies are subject to but cohort studies are not.
Second, even though the researchers had adjusted for some
confounding factors in the original studies, including age,
smoking, BMI, and energy intake, the possibility of residual
confounding cannot be ruled out.

In conclusion, this meta-analysis provides evidence that
dietary cholesterol is a significant risk factor for breast
cancer. Given the high prevalence and incidence of breast
cancer worldwide, the observed association between die-
tary cholesterol and breast cancer has clinical and public
health value. A low-fat/low-cholesterol diet and avoidance
of overweight/obesity will be beneficial. Besides, in the
future investigations, 27HC, as a metabolite of cholesterol,
should be paid more attention, especially in postmeno-
pausal women with estrogen receptor–positive breast
cancer.

reasonable conclusions. Second, we extracted RRs that reflected
the greatest degree of control for potential confounders,
increasing the credibility of the results. Third, almost all studies
in this meta-analysis adjusted for major risk factors, including
age, energy intake, body mass index (BMI), and smoking,
making the results more credible. Fourth, we conducted a
dose-response analysis to explore the relationship between
cholesterol consumption and breast cancer.

and 3 case-control studies were included in this study, and
the pooled RR was 1.07 (95% CI, 0.98-1.17) for the cohort study
and 2.12 (95% CI, 1.17- 3.84) for case-control studies. The most
likely explanation for this difference is recall bias that case-
