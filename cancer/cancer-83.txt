META-ANALYSIS OF EPIDEMIOLOGICAL STUDIES

The hypothesis that consumption of red and processed
meat increases colorectal cancer risk is reassessed in a meta-
analysis of articles published during 1973–99. The mean rel-
ative risk (RR) for the highest quantile of intake vs. the lowest
was calculated and the RR per gram of intake was computed
through log-linear models. Attributable fractions and pre-
ventable fractions for hypothetical reductions in red meat
consumption in different geographical areas were derived
using the RR log-linear estimates and prevalence of red meat
consumption from FAO data and national dietary surveys.
High intake of red meat, and particularly of processed meat,
was associated with a moderate but signiﬁcant increase in
colorectal cancer risk. Average RRs and 95% conﬁdence in-
tervals (CI) for the highest quantile of consumption of red
meat were 1.35 (CI: 1.21–1.51) and of processed meat, 1.31
(CI: 1.13–1.51). The RRs estimated by log-linear dose-re-
sponse analysis were 1.24 (CI: 1.08 –1.41) for an increase of
120 g/day of red meat and 1.36 (CI: 1.15–1.61) for 30 g/day of
processed meat. Total meat consumption was not signiﬁ-
cantly associated with colorectal cancer risk. The risk frac-
tion attributable to current levels of red meat intake was in
the range of 10 –25% in regions where red meat intake is high.
If average red meat intake is reduced to 70 g/week in these
regions, colorectal cancer risk would hypothetically decrease
by 7–24%.

Experimental and epidemiological studies have shown that food
and nutrition modify colorectal cancer risk. The scientiﬁc evidence
has been evaluated and summarised in recommendations by dif-
ferent expert groups that conclude that red meat consumption is
likely to be related to increased risk of colorectal cancer. In 1996,
the Colon Cancer Panel of the World Health Organisation-consen-
sus conference on Nutrition in Prevention and Therapy on Cancer1
concluded that consumption of red meat and processed meat was
probably associated with increased risk for colorectal cancer and
recommended that consumption of ﬁsh and poultry should be
preferred to red meat. In the same year,
the Centre national
d’E` tudes et de Recommandations sur la Nutrition et l’Alimentation
(CNERNA) in France published an evaluation of the scientiﬁc data
on nutrition and cancer, in which the experts concluded that a diet
poor in vegetables and rich in meat or fat of animal origin (ex-
cepting ﬁsh) is usually associated with an increased risk of colon
cancer.2 More recently, 2 major reports by the World Cancer
Research Fund (WCRF)/American Institute for Cancer Research
Report (AICR)3 and the Working Group on Diet and Cancer of the
Committee on Medical Aspects of Food and Nutrition Policy
(COMA)4 of the United Kingdom, recommended that western
populations should decrease their consumption of red meat and
increase consumption of vegetables in order to reduce colorectal
cancer risk. Both panels agreed that the epidemiological results on
meat were not consistent, but recognised that the studies conducted
so far found either increased colorectal cancer risk or no associa-
tion with risk, while no study has found a reduction in risk
associated with high meat consumption.

Several hypotheses have been developed to explain the associ-
ation between colorectal cancer risk and red meat.5 The fat content
of red meat could inﬂuence colon cancer risk by increasing the
excretion of bile acids, whose products may act as tumour pro-
moters by a non-speciﬁc irritant effect that increases cell prolifer-

ation in the colonic mucosa.6,7 Other products of fat digestion,
such as diacylglycerides, could selectively induce mitogenesis of
adenomas and some carcinoma cells.8 Fat could act by increasing
saturated fatty acid content, or decreasing polyunsaturated fatty
acid content in cell membranes leading to a reduction of the
number and activity of insulin receptors.9,10 Hyperinsulinemia
could act as a growth factor and tumor promoter11,12 and recent
epidemiological evidence supports the association of insulin resis-
tance with colon cancer risk.13 The meat fat-hypothesis is consis-
tent with the ﬁnding that lean beef did not promote colon carci-
nogenesis in rats14 and that high consumption of beef could
increase the concentration of secondary faecal bile acids.15,16 Nev-
ertheless, epidemiological studies have failed to show a consistent
relationship between fat intake and colorectal cancer.5,17

During digestion, dietary protein is broken down into amino
acids that are further degraded to ammonia, which may be carci-
nogenic to the colon.18 There is, however, very limited evidence
that protein per se increases colorectal cancer risk and some
epidemiological studies have even reported a protective associa-
tion between dietary protein and colon cancer. A possible expla-
nation for this unexpected ﬁnding is that low intake of methionine
may contribute to DNA methylation abnormalities, which might
appear to be important in the initiation and progression of colon
cancer.19 Meat can be a major source of protein, but there is no
evidence of an effect of meat protein on colorectal cancer risk.

Red meat has a higher iron content than white meat. Dietary iron
enhances lipid peroxidation in the mouse colon and augments
dimethylhydrazine-induced colorectal tumours in mice and rats20
but the results of epidemiological studies are still insufﬁcient.21,22
Red meat intake23 enhances the production of endogenous pro-
moters and possible carcinogens24,25 such as N-nitroso compounds
(NOC), which have been shown to induce the formation of DNA
adducts in human colonocytes.26 The same effect has not been
observed with white meat.23,27 NOC are also formed endogenously
because the amines and amides produced primarily by bacterial
decarboxylation of amino acids can be N-nitrosated in the presence
of a nitrosating agent.28 –30 Nitrosamines have been detected in
foods with added nitrates or nitrites, including salt-preserved ﬁsh
and meat and in food processed by smoking or direct-ﬁre dry-

ing.31,32 Supplements of nitrate have been shown to elevate faecal
NOC levels.27

A mechanism that has attracted particular attention is the for-
mation of heterocyclic amines (HCA) and polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons (PAH) in meat when it is cooked at high temperature
for a long time or over an open ﬂame. HCA and particularly the
2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo (4,5-b) pyridine (PhIP) and
the 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (MeIQx) are
powerful mutagens and carcinogenic in mice, rats and non-human
primates in a wide variety of organs, mainly the liver, but also skin,
lung, colon and mammary gland.23,33 The carcinogenic potential of
heterocyclic amines in humans has not been established. PAHs are
widely believed to make a substantial contribution to the overall
burden of cancer in humans via tobacco smoking, occupational and
environmental exposures. The major dietary sources of PAHs are
cereals and vegetables rather than meat due to environmental
contamination, except where there is high consumption of meat
cooked over an open ﬂame, as when barbecuing.34,35 Information
on dietary practices, such as cooking methods (frying, broiling,
smoking and barbecuing), meat doneness and surface browning
has been used to evaluate the potential relationship of dietary
exposure to HCAs and PAHs with colorectal cancer or colorectal
adenoma risk,36 –50 but the epidemiological evidence is still limited
and many methodological issues need to be solved. The fact that
the metabolism of heterocyclic amines can be more or less efﬁcient
depending on the genetic variability of at least three enzymes
involved in N-acetylation (NAT1, NAT2 and CYP1a2) makes the
problem more complex and data from epidemiological stud-
ies45,51–57 on acetylation status and colorectal cancer risk are
sparse and somewhat conﬂicting.

In this article, the epidemiological literature on meat and colo-
rectal cancer is reviewed and the results quantitatively summarized
with two purposes. The ﬁrst is to reassess the status of the meat/
colorectal cancer hypothesis based on the global epidemiological
evidence. The second aim is to provide estimates of the proportion
of colorectal cancer attributable to current red meat consumption,
as well as estimates of the effect that hypothetical changes in red
meat consumption could have on colorectal cancer incidence in
different geographical areas of the world, assuming that the asso-
ciation is causal and that the simulated change in meat consump-
tion levels could be achieved.

Search methods

MATERIAL AND METHODS

The criteria for inclusion of epidemiological studies were: case-
control or cohort studies evaluating the relationship between total
meat, red meat or processed meat and colon, rectal or colorectal
cancer risk; in males, females or in both sexes combined; with
incidence or mortality as the endpoint; providing the information
required for the statistical analysis; published in English between
1973 and 1999 and referenced in the Medline database (National
Library of Medicine, Washington, DC). Besides the MEDLINE
search, we systematically examined the list of references in the
identiﬁed articles.

The deﬁnition of exposure varied between studies. In most of
the articles, total meat (sometimes simply called meat) included
white and red meat from all sources while in others, fresh meat
only was considered. Red meat was sometimes deﬁned as the
intake of beef, veal, pork, mutton and lamb consumed fresh,
whereas in others, processed red meat was also included as part of
the red meat group. Processed meat was deﬁned in our article as
the group including any of the following foods: ham, raw ham,
cured or smoked bacon, sausage, cured or smoked lunch meat,
salami, nitrite-treated meats and meat-products. “Charcuterie” and
“delicatessen” were also considered equivalent
to “processed
meat.”

Statistical methods

The overall effect-size statistics estimated were the average of
the logarithm of the observed relative risks (estimated as the odds
ratio in most of the studies) associated to the highest versus the
lowest level of consumption, as reported in the papers. The RR
was weighted by the inverse of its variance. A random effect
meta-analysis was performed in situations where heterogeneity
was present58 to incorporate the between-study component of
variance in the weight.59 Only studies reporting RR estimates with
conﬁdence intervals or quantitative information allowing their
computation were included in the meta-analysis.

For the dose-response analysis, the method proposed by Green-
land and Longnecker60 was used, that accounts for the correlation
between risk estimates for separate exposure levels depending on
the same reference group. The summary estimate was the pooled
coefﬁcient b in the linear-logistic regression model lnRR ⫽ bX,
where X is the difference of meat intake between each category
and the reference category. The individual slopes of each study
were combined by weighted average, using the inverse of their
variances as weights. Random effect models were assumed when
there was evidence of heterogeneity. 95% conﬁdence intervals (CI)
were calculated for the common regression slopes. An SAS macro
was written for this purpose.

We extracted from the studies the risk estimates that reﬂected
the greatest degree of controlling for confounders (i.e., risk factors
or energy). The method required that the number of case subjects,
the number of control subjects, the adjusted logarithm of the RR
and its variance estimates for three or more exposure levels were
known. Some extra-computation was performed to complete the
required data, provided that the paper gave the information to do
so. If this was not possible, the paper was not included in the
dose-response analysis. The log-rank test of Begg and Mazumdar61
were used to explore publication bias.

Interstudy variation was analyzed by performing subgroup iden-
tiﬁcation62 and meta-regression analysis60 using the Genmod pro-
cedure in SAS. The main sources of heterogeneity examined were
design (case-control or cohort), site (colon, rectum or colorectal),
geographical area (USA, Europe or other), gender (males, females
or both genders combined) and meat deﬁnition (fresh meat and
fresh plus processed meat together).

Rescaling of exposure

For the dose-response analysis the intake was rescaled to grams
per day. If the highest category was open-ended, the open-ended
boundary was calculated using as interval length the width of the
closest interval. When the lowest category was open-ended, the
lowest boundary was considered as zero. The value of X of each
category was then calculated as the mid-point of the logarithm of
the boundaries, retransformed to grams per day.

When the exposures were expressed on a qualitative scale (e.g.,
high, medium, low), we used the mean consumption and the
variance given in the article to estimate midpercentiles of each
category assuming lognormal distribution. When exposure was
expressed as the frequency of consumption, we used 120 g as the
approximate average “portion size” of meat and of red meat and
50 g as “serving size.” The portion size of processed meat was 50 g
as well. We based our decision on the results of the Continuing
Survey of Food Intakes by Individuals 1989 –91 of the United
States63 and preliminary results of the Dietary Survey of the
European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition
(EPIC) (Riboli, unpublished data).64

Fraction of colorectal cancer risk attributable to red meat
consumption

We obtained estimates of the proportion of risk attributable to
red meat consumption (AP) using the relative risks estimated with
the dose-response curve associated to quartiles of consumption of
red meat using non-consumption as reference category. The for-
mula provided by Miettinen was applied.65

reasons: odds ratios reported only when they were signiﬁcant,84 no
conﬁdence intervals,80 or no odds ratios provided.37 The excluded
RR were not signiﬁcant with the exception of a study reporting a
signiﬁcant risk decrease for cancer of the rectum, but not of the
colon80 and the signiﬁcant values found in another study for 2 of
the 8 odds ratios reported.84

The pooled estimate of the average RR was 1.14 (95% CI
0.99 –1.31) (Fig. 1). There was evidence of lack of homogeneity
when all studies were considered together. The estimates by sub-
groups together with the results of the heterogeneity tests are given
in Table I. Only one cohort study on an Adventist population42
found a signiﬁcant association. In this study, both red meat and
white meat contributed independently to a risk increase of 85% in
subjects consuming meat once a week or more often, compared
with non-consumers. Studies in which meat was deﬁned as fresh
meat have a lower average relative risk (RR: 1.01; 95% CI:
0.64 –1.60) than studies deﬁning meat as fresh plus processed meat
(1.16; 95% CI: 1.01–1.34). The subgroups of cohort studies, the
subgroups of males, females and of cancer of the rectum were the
only subgroups not heterogeneous.

Dose-response meta-analysis

Eighteen studies (5 cohort and 13 case-control) were included in
the dose-response meta-analysis and 9 were excluded, of which
284,93 found a signiﬁcant risk increase associated with high con-
sumption. In addition to 3 case-control studies that were excluded
from the previous analysis,37,80,84 7 more studies were excluded
because the exposure was classiﬁed in 2 categories69,71,74 or be-
cause the distribution of cases and control subjects by exposure
level78,87,93,97 was not provided.

Among the 18 studies included in the meta-analysis, only 4
case-control and 1 cohort study reported exposure in grams per
day. For case-control studies the inter-quantile mean range of
intake was 126 g/day for studies reporting consumption in g/day

As estimates of the prevalence of red meat consumption by
geographical area, we used per caput intakes provided in Food
Balance Sheets by the Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO,
http://apps.fao.org), corrected for overestimation with data pub-
lished from 18 national dietary surveys.66,67 The correction factor
was computed as the ratio between the per caput calorie intake
estimated in a dietary survey in a given country and the per caput
calorie intake published by the FAO for that country in the same
year as the survey. Caloric intake was chosen to deduce an overall
“correction factor,” even if its overestimation is not exactly the
same as for red meat, because energy values were available in all
the surveys. For geographical areas for which we were not able to
ﬁnd dietary surveys, the correction factor of the closest region was
applied (Appendix 1). A ratio of male/female consumption was
computed in the surveys providing the information and its average
applied for those regions for which this information was not
available.

Quartiles of consumption were calculated assuming a lognormal
distribution. To do that, we applied the total coefﬁcient of variation
of red meat consumption by gender estimated in the EPIC cohort
study, that is, 83% for women and 85% for men.

Finally, the exercise included an estimation of the proportion of
cancer cases that could potentially be prevented assuming a hypo-
thetical reduction in red meat consumption in each population to
an average of 70 g/week, i.e., a small portion of red meat once a
week. The preventable proportion (PP) was estimated as proposed
by Miettinen.65

Attributable risk could not be estimated for processed meat
consumption because we could not ﬁnd estimates of processed
meat consumption worldwide.

Characteristics of studies

RESULTS

Thirty-four case-control studies37,39,41,43,47,54,68 –95 and 14 cohort
studies19,40,42,44,48,50,57,96 –102 were identiﬁed in our search. The
main characteristics of the studies are presented in Appendix 2.
Fourteen case-control studies were carried out in Europe, 11 in the
USA (including 2 in Hawaii), 3 in Japan, 2 in Australia and 1 each
in Canada, China, Singapore and Argentina. Nine out of the 14
cohort studies were conducted in USA, 2 of which were based on
Adventist Populations. Four cohorts were European and 1 was
Japanese. Twenty-two of the case-control studies reported results
on colon cancer risk, but only 16 provided also results on rectal
cancer risk. Twelve studies reported the results for the 2 sites
combined and not separately for colon and rectum. Ten case-
control studies gave the results separately for men and women and
2 case-control studies were carried out only in men. The remaining
reported odds ratios for both sexes combined. Seven of the cohorts
reported results for colorectal cancer, only 1 analysed colon and
rectal cancer separately and 6 focused only on colon cancer. Four
cohort studies were carried out in men; 3 in women and 3 cohort
studies reported the results separately for both men and women.
Total meat was deﬁned as fresh plus processed meat in 19
studies, whereas only fresh meat was evaluated in 8 studies. Fish
was reported together with meat in 4 case-control studies and eggs
in 2. Red meat was deﬁned as fresh beef, pork and lamb consump-
tion in 13 studies whereas processed red meat was also included in
this category in 11 studies.

Total meat

Twenty-one case-control and 6 cohort studies investigated total
meat consumption and colorectal cancer risk, of which 3 case-
control and one cohort study found a signiﬁcant positive associa-
tion. Only 1 study found a signiﬁcantly reduced colorectal cancer
risk for meat consumption.

Average relative risk

All cohort studies were included in the estimation of the average
RR. Three case-control studies were excluded for the following

and slightly lower, 114 g/day for studies where the rescaling was
applied. In cohort studies the mean ranges were 100 g/day and 94
g/day respectively.

The results for all studies combined and for subgroups are given
in Table II. The RR estimated from the beta pooling that is
associated with a consumption of 120 g/day of meat compared to
no consumption is RR: 1.12 (95% CI: 0.98 –1.30). On average, the
epidemiological studies included in the analysis found no increase
in colorectal cancer risk associated with this level of meat intake.
The publication bias test was not statistically signiﬁcant (p ⫽
0.58).

There is heterogeneity between all studies, but homogeneity
is not rejected for cohort studies. Meta-regressions using the
beta estimates for each study as the dependent variable, and the
design, geographical area, cancer site, sex and meat deﬁnition
as explanatory variables were tested in different models using
as weight the inverse of the variance of the beta estimate. The
only signiﬁcant predictor of beta was geographical area, with
North American studies ﬁnding lower slopes than studies from
other geographical areas. When the two variables, geographical
area and meat deﬁnition were included together in the model,
the difference between American studies and the other geo-
graphical areas disappeared. The slope for studies on fresh meat
was lower than for fresh plus processed meat, but they were not
signiﬁcantly different.

Red meat

Fifteen case-control and 9 cohort studies investigated red meat.
Six case-control studies reported a signiﬁcant risk increase or
signiﬁcant trend associated with higher levels of red meat intake.
In 2 of them the association was signiﬁcant for cancer of the
rectum but not for the colon. In 1 study there was a signiﬁcant
trend in females but not in males or in both sexes combined. Two

out of 9 cohort studies reported relative risks signiﬁcantly higher
than 1.

Average relative risk

Only 1 case-control study,80 which did not provide conﬁdence
intervals, was excluded from the analysis (Fig. 2). In contrast with
the results for total meat, the estimated averaged RR for red meat
was signiﬁcantly higher than one (RR: 1.35; 95% CI: 1.21–1.51).
As for total meat, homogeneity was not rejected for cohort studies,
while case-control studies were heterogeneous and, on average,
provided higher RR estimates than cohort studies (Table I). The
subgroups of European and North American studies are internally
heterogeneous, with Europeans having a larger average relative
risk. Within North American studies, cohort studies have a larger
average relative risk (RR: 1.45; 95% CI: 1.20 –1.76) than case-
control studies (RR: 1.28; 95% CI: 0.87–1.89). Studies on males
and on cancer of the rectum were homogeneous. For the remaining
subgroups homogeneity was rejected. When considering the def-
inition of exposure, a higher average RR was obtained from studies
that included processed meat in the red meat group (RR: 1.49;
95%CI: 1.26 –1.77), compared to studies that did not (RR: 1.28;
95% CI: 1.11–1.47).

Dose-response meta-analysis

Eighteen studies (9 case-control and 9 cohort) were included in
the dose-response meta-analysis whereas 5 studies had to be ex-
cluded. The reasons for exclusion are: no conﬁdence interval,80
only 2 levels of exposure,74,90 no distribution of cases and control
subjects by exposure level87 and RR not reported.39 One of the
excluded studies found a signiﬁcant risk increase associated with
high consumption90 and the others found no signiﬁcant risk in-
crease. The inter-quantile mean ranges of intake were 116 g/day
for 3 cohort studies that reported intake in g/day and 101 g/day for
the remaining cohort studies for which we estimated intake by

rescaling. The three case-control studies that reported intake in
g/day had the same inter-quantile mean range as the remaining
case-control studies after rescaling (93 g/day).

The results are presented in Table II. The estimated risk asso-
ciated with consumption of 120 g/day of red meat compared to no
consumption was 1.24 (95% CI: 1.08 –1.41). Based on the studies
included in the meta-analysis, there was no evidence of publication
bias (p ⫽ 0.52). There was heterogeneity between all studies
together but homogeneity was not rejected for cohort studies
(p-heterogeneity ⫽ 0.17). In the meta-regression analysis, only the
model with geographical area as predictor produced statistically
signiﬁcant estimates: the estimate of relative risk was higher for
European than for North American studies. The signiﬁcance of
geographical area disappeared when meat deﬁnition was included
in the model.

The dose-response was stronger and statistically signiﬁcant for
studies that included processed meat in the red meat group (RR:
1.28; 95%CI: 1.11–1.48) compared to studies that investigated
only fresh red meat, for which the estimated risk was not signiﬁ-
cant (RR: 1.19 95% CI: 0.91–1.55). If the American studies are
considered separately, studies evaluating only fresh meat reported
lower risks on average (RR: 1.05; 95%CI: 0.55–2.00) than studies
where the red meat category included processed meats (RR: 1.24;
95%CI: 1.07–1.43) but the homogeneity was rejected for both
groups. The results are similar for European studies, where the RR
estimated for studies on fresh red meat is lower (RR: 1.41; 95%CI:
0.91–2.20) than for studies on fresh red meat plus processed meat
(RR: 2.07; 95% CI: 1.25–3.42).

Processed meat

Processed meat was evaluated in 29 studies, 22 case-controls
and 7 cohorts. Two cohort studies found a signiﬁcant trend, one
cohort found a signiﬁcantly increased risk for consumption be-
tween 2 and 4 times/week compared to no consumption and 12
case-control studies reported odds ratios signiﬁcantly higher than 1.

FIGURE 3 – Relative risks (highest vs. lowest category) for case-

control and cohort studies (processed meat).

Average relative risks

Six studies were not included in the estimation of the average
relative risks because either they did not provide conﬁdence inter-
vals,69,75,80 each type of processed meat was evaluated separate-
ly79,85 or the number of subjects was very small.82 The average RR
for the 23 studies included in the analysis was 1.31 (95% CI:
1.13–1.51) (Fig. 3). The results were heterogeneous and, similarly
to what was found for total meat and red meat, homogeneity was
not rejected within cohort studies. Subgroup analysis within case-
control studies showed that homogeneity was not rejected for the
subgroups of males, females and for rectal cancer (Table I).

Dose-response meta-analysis

Sixteen studies (9 case-control and 7 cohort) were included in
the dose-response meta-analysis and 13 case-control studies were
excluded, of which 6 studies had also been excluded from the
previous average RR estimation. The reasons for exclusion were:
only 2 categories of exposure,74,78,88 RR estimated only for the
highest level of consumption37,41 and distribution of case and
control subjects not provided.39,87 Five of the excluded studies
reported a signiﬁcant risk increase associated with increased con-
sumption, 1 a non-signiﬁcant decrease and the remainder found
non-signiﬁcant risk increases. There is no evidence of publication
bias (p ⫽ 0.75). The mean range of intake for case-control studies
was 39 g/day for the 3 studies that reported intake quantitatively
and 34 g/day when rescaled; for cohort studies the mean range was
60 g/day (2 cohorts) and 30 g/day respectively.

The association estimated with the pooled dose-response meta-
analysis was stronger for processed meat than for any other meat
type considered in this study (Fig. 4). The relative risk estimated
for a consumption of 30 g/day compared with no consumption was
1.36 (95% CI: 1.15–1.61) (Table II). The same relative risk would
be associated with a consumption of 170 g/day of red meat,

246

according to the results of the dose-response meta-analysis on red
meat. Overall, the studies are not homogenous (p-heterogeneity ⬍
0.001), but heterogeneity was not rejected for cohort studies. None
of the variables evaluated in the meta-regression analysis ex-
plained the heterogeneity.

Estimation of the fraction prevented by current consumption of
red meat worldwide

The per caput intake of red meat by geographical area estimated
for 1995 is presented in Table III. The regions with the lowest
correction factor, i.e., with the highest discrepancy between FAO
data and current consumption, are Europe, United States and High
Income Asia (correction factors of 0.69, 0.60 and 0.70 respec-
tively). These discrepancies can be explained in part because food
waste in these countries is high and possibly because the surveys
from which the correction factors were deduced are of better
quality. The correction factor for Middle East Asia was similar to
the value for Europe and America, but was based only on a survey

FIGURE 4 – Dose-response analysis of relative risk of colorectal

cancer for meat consumption.

in Turkey. FAO per caput intakes were lower than the mean
consumption reported in dietary surveys for India and for males in
Low Income Asia, China, India, South America, Caribbean, North
Africa and Sub-Saharan Africa.

The proportion of colorectal cancer incidence attributable to
current levels of red meat intake was computed using the beta-
pooled estimates in the dose-response analysis. The same slope
was used for all geographical areas and for both sexes for two main
reasons: ﬁrst the overall estimate had the advantage of being based
on a larger number of studies and second, the subgroups deﬁned by
geographical area and by sex were not homogeneous.

The proportion of cancer risk attributable to current red meat
consumption compared to non-consumption, as well as the pre-
ventable proportion simulating a shift of average consumption to
70 g/week are presented in Table III. The attributable proportion
ranges from almost 25% for men in some countries of South
America, followed by Australia and New Zealand (19.6%) and
North America (13.9%) where consumption of red meat is high, to
2–3% in Chinese and Indian women, who eat very little red meat.
When a hypothetical reduction to an average consumption of 70
g/week is simulated, the proportion of preventable risk ranges from
25–11.9% in men and from 17.2–7.5% in women in countries
where the consumption is very high. In countries where the con-
tribution of red meat to the diet is very low, as in India, Africa and
some regions of Asia, less than 5% of the incidence could be
potentially prevented.

DISCUSSION

The quantitative summary of the published literature on the risk
of colorectal cancer and meat consumption suggests that high
intakes of red meat and of processed meat are associated with
increased risk of colorectal cancer. No signiﬁcant association was
found for total meat consumption and colorectal cancer risk. These
results are consistent for case-control and cohort studies, for Amer-
ican, European and Asian studies (with the exception of one
Argentinean study), for studies on males, females and both genders
combined, and for studies on colon, rectal and colorectal cancer.
The use and interpretation of meta-analysis in epidemiology has
raised methodological debates and controversial opinions. The
most obvious limitation is that results are combined from studies
conducted with different methods in different populations, result-
ing in heterogeneity. In our meat-analyses, heterogeneity was more
often present within case-control than within cohort studies, which

could be explained to some extent by the fact that most of the
cohorts are North-American and used similar methodologies for
dietary assessment. Case-control studies from North America and
also from Europe remained heterogeneous, however, when studies
in the two geographical areas were analyzed separately. Homoge-
neity was not always rejected when composing subgroups by sex
and by cancer site. It is not clear how much of it could be explained
by publication bias, because it may be that results are reported
separately by sex or cancer site only when they correspond to a
certain expectation.

Even though the effect-size estimates differed slightly between
case-control and cohort studies, recall bias is very unlikely to
account for the positive association we found between red and
processed meat and colorectal cancer risk because the direction-
ality of the summary measure of association was the same for both
types of studies. Differences between the 2 study designs can
partially explain the differences. The time interval between the
period covered by the dietary assessment and diagnosis of the
disease is usually 1 year (recent diet) in case-control studies
although it can be as large as 10 –20 years (current diet at the time
of subject recruitment) in cohort studies.

Additional methodological issues concern the dietary measure-
ment methods and their validation. We did not attempt to stratify
studies by type of questionnaire or by results of their validity
studies, because the information given in the papers was very often
insufﬁcient to do so. The imprecision of dietary assessment meth-
ods causes random measurement errors, which lead to underesti-
mation of the magnitude of the relationship between dietary intake
and cancer risk. It has been estimated that, for typical degrees of
measurement error, the underestimation is roughly 2-fold ,103 but
this may be larger if dietary intake was not assessed during the
period of exposure most relevant to cancer etiology, which is not
known with any precision. We decided not to apply formal cor-
rections for measurement error, which would have increased the
pooled relative risk estimates because, with very few exceptions,
no data from dietary questionnaire validation studies were avail-
able for the different types of questionnaire used and for the
speciﬁc underlying study population.

There is the theoretical possibility that the association between
red meat and processed meat and colorectal cancer risk could be
due to uncontrolled confounding factors. Known or suspected risk
factors were controlled for in many of the studies. It is the opinion
of the authors that the diversity of the populations where the
studies were carried out argues against the hypothesis that un-
known confounders can entirely explain the association.

We found that relative risks for total and red meat were more
elevated in studies that included processed meat in the deﬁnition of
these 2 meat groups than in studies that evaluated fresh meat and
fresh red meat (Fig. 4), that could be a support for an increased
effect of processed meat. These results should be taken with
caution for different reasons: these subgroups were set up a pos-
teriori, after the data had been seen, and the ﬁnding could be
spurious; besides, the deﬁnition of meat groups is not always clear
in the publications. Nevertheless, this ﬁnding is in agreement with
the summary relative risk per gram of intake estimated from the
dose-response relationship, which was higher for processed meat
than for red meat consumption.

The calculation of population attributable risks for diet has
speciﬁc methodological limitations, particularly due to the fact that
the population distribution by exposure level
is not precisely
known and the association with cancer risk is measured with some
approximations. We estimated the prevalence of red meat con-
sumption using data that do not refer to individuals, but to popu-
lations. In order to estimate the attributable risk fraction, we used
the overall slope estimated in the dose-response analysis instead of
slopes estimated for subgroups of different geographical areas, sex
or cancer sub-sites. Our decision was mainly due to the fact that
most of the studies were carried out in the USA and in Western
Europe, and there were not enough studies to obtain meaningful

estimates for speciﬁc geographical areas of the world. The overall
slope had the advantage of being the result of the largest number
of available studies. The coefﬁcient of variation applied for the
estimation of quartile distribution of red meat intake was the value
found in the preliminary analysis of EPIC data. The application of
a lower coefﬁcient of variation will not change the estimates
substantially, but if the variability is much higher than the hypo-
thetical value used, our estimates of attributable risk and prevent-
able proportion would be an overestimation of the real unknown
corresponding values. For North America, for example, if a coef-
ﬁcient of variation of an extreme value such as 200% is applied,
instead of 85% as we did, the attributable risk fraction in men will
be 9% instead of 14% and the preventable fraction 8% instead of
12 %. The decrease is more important if the average intake level
is high than if it is low.

Estimates of cancer risks attributable to diet have been pub-
lished in the past. Doll and Peto, in their widely quoted 1981
paper104 estimated that 35% of all US cancer deaths and even 90%
of colon cancer deaths were attributable to diet. These ﬁgures now
appear questionable because epidemiological evidence suggests
quite strongly that physical activity accounts for an important
percentage of avoidable colon cancer. More recently, Willett105
estimated that 50 – 80% of colorectal cancer deaths could be avoid-
able by dietary change. In the Health Professionals Follow-Up
Study,106 it was estimated that about a third to a half of colon
cancer risk might be avoidable if exposure to 6 risk factors (over-
weight, physical activity, supplementation with folic acid, alcohol
consumption, smoking and red meat intake) were modiﬁed to
become equal to that of the men in the approximate bottom 20% or
bottom 5% of a risk score distribution. In a case-control study, La
Vecchia et al.107 estimated that 56% of colon cancer risk would
have been avoided if all subjects were moved to the lowest
exposure levels of 6 risk factors considered together. The attrib-
utable risk for individual factors was 12% for high education, 14%
for low physical activity, 14% for high energy intake, 22% for low
vegetable intake, 7% for high eating frequency, and 8% for a
family history of colorectal cancer. In a case-control study in
Northern Italy,90 the proportion of risk of colorectal cancer attrib-
utable to red meat consumption was estimated as 16% for males
and 17% for females. In our study, the estimates of colorectal
cancer risk attributable to current red meat consumption were 9.7%
and 7.3% for Southern European men and women. The highest
estimates of the attributable fraction correspond to the areas of
highest per caput red meat consumption, Argentina, Uruguay and
Paraguay, followed by Australia and New Zealand and by North
America.

We computed the reduction in cancer risk that could potentially
be achieved with a hypothetical dietary reduction of average red
meat consumption from current levels to an average of 70 g/week.
In simulating a change, we chose as goal the intake of this small
portion size once a week because at this level there is no evidence
of excess risk compared to no consumption. Therefore, this as-
sumption does not require complete avoidance of red meat. Such
a reduction could potentially lead to a decrease in colorectal cancer
risk in men as high as 17.9% in Australia and 12.1% in North
America. According to the estimated preventable proportions, ap-
proximately 22,000 incident cases could be avoided in North
America, 21,000 in Europe, 7,000 in Asia and 6,000 in South
America.

In calculating attributable and preventable fractions, we as-
sumed that the association between red meat consumption and
colorectal cancer is causal and free from bias. Our estimates refer
only to a single risk factor, but individual dietary factors may not
contribute independently. Other dietary and non-dietary factors,
such as vegetable and fruit intake, smoking habits, reproductive
history, physical activity and infectious agents, may also contrib-
ute to risk differences. The isolated change of a single dietary
factor represents a simpliﬁcation and it may well be that interven-
tions addressing the totality of diet-related risk factors could re-

248

move a larger proportion of excess risk. Based on the available
data, it is not possible to determine to what extent reducing
exposure to modiﬁable risk factors at various ages, after exposure
at varying levels for varying duration, will prevent colorectal
cancer. Neither is it possible to estimate the latency between a
reduction in average red meat consumption occurring in a given

population and the expected reduction in colorectal cancer inci-
dence.

Our results do not imply that meat consumption should be
completely avoided as part of a balanced diet. Nevertheless, they
support previous recommendations3 to adopt a diet characterized
by low intake of red and processed meat.
