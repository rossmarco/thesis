Abstract
Lower serum level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D is associated with several negative outcomes. However, previous studies have indicated
that 25-hydroxyvitamin D is associated with lung cancer risk and survival, but presented controversial results.

PubMed and Embase databases were searched update to August 2017 to identify and quantify the potential association between

25-hydroxyvitamin D and lung cancer risk and survival.

Seventeen eligible studies involving a total of 138,858 participants with 4368 incident cases were included in this meta-analysis.
Our results showed statistically signiﬁcant association between 25-hydroxyvitamin D and lung cancer risk and mortality. However,
circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D was not associated with overall
lung cancer survival. Furthermore, compared with the lowest
circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D, the highest circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D is signiﬁcantly decreased risk of lung cancer risk in male
and female. In addition, the highest circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D was signiﬁcantly associated with a lower risk in Caucasian and
Asian. We also obtained the best ﬁt at an inﬂection point of 10 nmol/L in piecewise regression analysis, increasing 10 nmol/L dose of
circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D was associated with an 8% reduction in the risk of lung cancer risk and an 7% reduction in the risk of
lung cancer mortality. Subgroup meta-analyses in study quality, number of participants, and number of cases showed consistent
with the primary ﬁndings.

The highest circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D was associated with decreased lung cancer risk and mortality but not overall survival

1. Introduction

Lung cancer is one of the most serious and malignant diseases
with the highest morbidity and mortality, and one of the most
serious malignancies for population health and life.[1] It accounts
for the ﬁrst incidence of all malignancies in male, with the second
highest incidence in female, and the mortality rate account for the
second of all malignancies.[2] According to the American Cancer
Association statistics, lung cancer mortality gradually increased,
the overall cure rate for lung cancer has not
improved
signiﬁcantly over the past decade.[3] These data reveal the poor
prognosis of lung cancer, and thus to prevent the occurrence of
lung cancer is essential. Compared with many other cancers,

there are a few identiﬁed risk factors for lung cancer, including
asthma, chronic obstructive emphysema, pneumonia, tuberculo-
sis, and atmospheric pollution.[4,5] Meanwhile,
the role of
vitamin D has been recognized as an independently risk in several
cancers, including lung cancer.[6] Vitamin D mainly exists in the
body in the form of circulating vitamin D, which is hydroxylated
into 25-hydroxyvitamin D in the liver.[7]

Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin, and the human body is
mainly vitamin D2 and vitamin D3. The body’s vitamin D is
mainly derived from the body’s own synthesis and animal
food. The main function of vitamin D is to maintain the
metabolism balance of human calcium and the formation of
bone. In addition, vitamin D deﬁciency is closely related to
abnormal immune function, cardiovascular disease, metabolic
diseases, and tumors.[8] Lower circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin
D is a common condition in lung cancer. Also, lower vitamin D
level is a potential reversible/modiﬁable risk factors for lung
cancer.[9]

Previous studies have examined the relationship between
circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D and risk of cardiovascular
disease, type 2 diabetes, and all-cause mortality, and have found
higher circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D is signiﬁcantly reduce
disease risk.[8,10] Even though some studies supported higher
circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D signiﬁcantly decrease lung
cancer risk and survival. However, the result remains controver-
sial. In addition, no study to quantitative assessed circulating 25-
hydroxyvitamin D and lung cancer risk and survival. Thus, we
performed this comprehensive dose–response meta-analysis to
clarify and quantitative assessed the correlation between
circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D and lung cancer.

2. Methods

Our meta-analysis was conducted according to the Meta-analysis
Of Observational Studies in Epidemiology checklist.[11] There are
no ethical issues involved in our study for our data were based on
published studies.

2.1. Search strategy

Eligible studies were systematically searched of PubMed and
Embase update to August 2017 examining the association between
circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D and lung cancer risk and
survival, with keywords
including “25-hydroxyvitamin D”
[MeSH] OR “vitamin D” [MeSH] AND “lung cancer” [MeSH]
OR “lung tumor” [MeSH]. We refer to the relevant original essays
and commentary articles to determine further relevant research.

2.2. Study selection

lung cancer

Two independent researchers investigate information: outcome
was
incidence and mortality. Moreover, we
precluded nonhuman studies, reviews, editorials, and published
letters. To ensure the correct identiﬁcation of qualiﬁed research,
the 2 researchers read the reports independently.

2.3. Data extraction

Use standardized data collection tables to extract data. Each
eligible article information was extracted by 2 independent
researchers. The following information was extracted: ﬁrst
author; publication year; age; country; sex; cases and partic-
ipants; and relative risk or odds ratio. We collect the risk
estimates with multivariable-adjusted. According to the New-
castle–Ottawa scale,[12] quality assessment was performed for
nonrandomized studies.

2.4. Statistical analysis

We pooled relative risk estimates to measure the association
between circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D and lung cancer risk
and survival. Results in different subgroup of circulating 25-
hydroxyvitamin D and lung cancer risk and survival were treated
as 2 separate reports.

Due to different deﬁnitions cut-off points in the included
studies for categories, using the method recommended by
Greenland, Longnecker and Orsini et al[13] by increase per 10
nmol/L circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D. A ﬂexible meta-
regression based on restricted cubic spline function was used
to ﬁt the potential nonlinear trend, and generalized least-square
method was used to estimate the parameters. This procedure
treats circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D (continuous data) as an
independent variable and logRR of diseases as a dependent
variable, with both tails of the curve restricted to linear.[14]
The between-study heterogeneity was assessed by Q-statistic
(signiﬁcance level at P  .10) and the I2 statistic.[15] STATA
software 12.0 (STATA Corp, College Station, TX) was used in all
analyses. P < .05 was considered signiﬁcant for all tests.

exclusion of studies, 17 studies were chosen, among the selected
studies, 9 studies about the relationships between circulating 25-
hydroxyvitamin D and lung cancer risk,[16–24] 3 studies about the
relationships between circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D and lung
cancer mortality,[25–27] 5 studies about the relationships between
circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D and lung cancer survival,[28–32]
and the data were extracted. These studies were published update
to August 2017.

3.2. Study characteristics

The characteristics of the included studies are shown in Tables 1
and 2. A total of 138,858 participants with 4368 incident cases
were included in this meta-analysis.
3.3. Circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D and lung cancer risk

Nine studies including 11 independent reports investigated the
association between circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D and lung
cancer risk. Higher circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D was
signiﬁcantly decreased risk of lung cancer (relevant risk [RR]:
0.84; 95% conﬁdence interval (CI): 0.74–0.95; P = .006; Table 3).
Furthermore, higher circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D was
associated with a signiﬁcantly decrement risk of lung cancer in
female (odds ratio [OR] = 0.16, 95% CI: 0.04–0.59, P < .001;
Table 3) and in male (OR = 0.82, 95% CI: 0.71–0.91, P < .001;
Table 3). In addition, higher circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D
was signiﬁcantly decreased risk in Caucasian (RR: 0.92; 95% CI:
0.88–0.95; P < .001; Table 3) and Asian (RR: 0.41; 95% CI:
0.19–0.91; P < .001; Table 3). We also obtained the best ﬁt at an
inﬂection point of 10 nmol/L in piecewise regression analysis,
increasing 10 nmol/L of circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D was
associated with a 8% reduction in the risk of lung cancer, the

number of participants, and number of cases showed consistent
with the primary ﬁndings.

Several plausible pathways may reasonable for the relation-
ship between 25-hydroxyvitamin D and lung cancer. Vitamin D
metabolites play a cytostatic effect most dependent on vitamin
D receptor. Previous study found that 25-hydroxyvitamin D
plays the role of inhibiting lung cancer cells growth in mouse
epidermal cells formation.[34] The immunomodulatory func-
tion of vitamin D metabolites may be an important mechanism
for vitamin D in prevent lung cancer; 25-hydroxyvitamin D can
inhibit the activity of mammalian target of rapamycin in lung
cancer cells and raise the level of protein expression, which can
promote the autophagy of tumor cells.[35] Meanwhile, 25-
hydroxyvitamin can induce the expression of major antioxidant
protein–superoxide dismutase SOD1 and SOD2,
thereby
inhibiting the formation of lung cancer to some extent.[36] In
addition, vitamin D can regulate immunological function of
lung epithelial cells and inhibit cellular proliferation and
angiogenesis while promoting cellular differentiation and
apoptosis.[34,37,38]

Some limitations must be considered in this meta-analysis.
First, we only select literature written in English, which may have
resulted in a language or cultural bias, other languages should be
chosen in the further. Second, we only select literature from
PubMed and Embase databases, other databases should be
chosen in the further.

In conclusion, our ﬁndings underscore the notion that higher
vitamin D was
signiﬁcantly associated with lung cancer
decrement.
large-scale and population-based
association studies must be performed in the future to validate
the risk identiﬁed in the current meta-analysis.

In the future,

survival.

25-hydroxyvitamin D was 1.04 (95% CI: 0.91–1.17, P = .827;
Fig. 4).

3.6. Subgroup analyses

Subgroup analysis was performed to check the stability of the
primary outcome. Subgroup meta-analyses in study quality,
number of participants, and number of cases showed consistent
ﬁndings (Table 3).

3.7. Publication bias

The results show that no obvious evidence of publication bias
was found in the associations between circulating 25-hydrox-
yvitamin D and lung cancer risk (Supplementary Table 1, http://
links.lww.com/MD/B951). P > .05 was considered no publica-
tion bias. A funnel plot for publication bias assessment is shown
in Supplementary Figures 1 to 3, http://links.lww.com/MD/B951.

4. Discussion

Vitamin D is an important vitamin, mainly from fat-rich ﬁsh,
butter, cheese, and fortiﬁed milk. The body itself can produce
vitamin D in the sun. However, vitamin D deﬁciency is a common
phenomenon.[8] It can maintain the stability of serum calcium
and phosphorus levels, when the serum calcium concentration is
low, it induced parathyroid hormone secretion, release it to the
kidney and bone cells.[33] Also, vitamin D participates in critical
cell functions such as cell proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation,
metastasis, and angiogenesis. Vitamin D is one of the indispens-
able elements of health and disease prevention. Previous studies
supported higher circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D signiﬁcantly
decrease lung cancer risk and survival. However, the result
remains controversial.

In the current, meta-analysis was based on 17 prospective
cohort studies, with 138,858 participants with 4368 incident
cases. Thus, this meta-analysis provides the most up-to-date
epidemiological evidence supporting higher circulating 25-
hydroxyvitamin D is helpful for lung cancer. A dose–response
analysis revealed that increasing 10 nmol/L dose of circulating
25-hydroxyvitamin D was associated with an 8% reduction in
the risk of lung cancer risk and a 7% reduction in the risk of lung
cancer mortality. Subgroup meta-analyses in study quality,
