Purpose of review
To clarify the role of dietary pattern on prognosis in breast cancer survivors.
Recent Ô¨Åndings
Observational trials show mixed results that do not strongly support an independent role
for dietary pattern in prognosis. Women‚Äôs Intervention Nutrition Study and Women‚Äôs
Healthy Eating and Living (WHEL) are two large randomized controlled trials that
address this question. The interventions from both studies achieved signiÔ¨Åcant
reductions in energy from fat, and the WHEL Study achieved large increases in
vegetables, fruit and Ô¨Åber. Women‚Äôs Intervention Nutrition Study examined
postmenopausal women only and reported a not-quite-signiÔ¨Åcant improved prognosis
for women in the intervention group, with the beneÔ¨Åt focused on ipsilateral localized
recurrences, but little improvement in the more important distal recurrences. This review
considers only WHEL postmenopausal women to aid a direct comparison with
Women‚Äôs Intervention Nutrition Study. The WHEL Study reported a convincing lack of
association between diet and prognosis. However, a secondary analysis suggests that
the dietary intervention reduced distal recurrences among the subgroup without hot
Ô¨Çashes at baseline.
Summary
There is no convincing evidence that changing dietary pattern following breast cancer
diagnosis will improve prognosis for most women with early stage breast cancer.
However, it would appear to be important for some subgroups. Further investigation of
mechanisms for such selective action is needed.

Introduction
Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers among
women in developed countries, and signiÔ¨Åcant advances
in early detection and treatment have led to high 10-year
survival rates and large prevalent survivor populations.
Clinical outcome among women diagnosed with appar-
ently similar cancers varies considerably, and does not
appear to be explained by treatment differences. Labora-
tory studies have identiÔ¨Åed multiple bioactive constitu-
ents in foods that appear to either promote carcinogenesis
or protect against it. As a result, there is considerable
interest in the question of whether dietary pattern can
inÔ¨Çuence a woman‚Äôs prognosis following breast cancer.

Prospective observational studies, or cohort studies,
measure the dietary component or pattern and then
monitor prognosis over time. These association studies

do not provide sufÔ¨Åcient evidence to conclude that
changing dietary pattern would alter prognosis. The ‚Äògold
standard‚Äô studies are randomized trials in which some
participants are assigned to make a major dietary change.
Several prospective observational studies have investi-
gated the link between dietary pattern and breast cancer
prognosis, and to date, two randomized clinical trials have
tested this association.

Observational studies
Most dietary studies, however, are compromised by
measurement errors in the commonly used self-reported
dietary patterns [1], and there are few proven biomarkers
of exposure to validate self-report. The extent of these
measurement errors has been highlighted by two separate
studies that have demonstrated that different self-
report methods change the study outcome [2,3]. Another

study showed an effect with a biomarker that was not
seen with self-reported intake [4,5].

Reviews of the observational studies of diet and breast
cancer prognosis have identiÔ¨Åed 14 studies since 1990
[6,7,8,9‚Äì21]. However, many of these studies measured
prebreast cancer dietary pattern shortly following diag-
nosis with breast cancer. As diets commonly change
following diagnosis [22], dietary recalls over extended
periods that include diagnosis have additional measure-
ment problems and are excluded from this review.

In 1994, the Canadian National Breast Screening Study
reported 5-year survival data from the subsample of 678
breast cancer cases that had completed a diet history prior
to diagnosis [23]. In this study, lower saturated fat intake
(but not intake of total fat or oleic acid) was associated
with survival, and women in the highest versus lowest
quartiles of intake of b carotene and vitamin C from food
sources appeared protected.

The Nurses‚Äô Health Study is a well-known long-term
investigation of a cohort of female registered nurses.
Holmes et al. [15] reported on a subsample (n¬º 1982)
who were diagnosed with breast cancer from 1976 to 1990
and completed a dietary assessment in the postdiagnosis
period and followed through 1994. Consumption of fruit,
red meat or grain-based products was not associated with
either all-cause mortality or breast carcinoma death.
However, among women with metastatic cancer, con-
sumption of vegetables, carotenoids and Ô¨Åber had lower
mortality rates. Kroenke et al. [17] reported on the 2619
nurses who were diagnosed from 1982 to 1998 and
completed a dietary questionnaire at least 1 year after
diagnosis. Over a median follow-up of 9 years, 9% of
participants died from breast cancer. Using factor
analysis,
researchers identiÔ¨Åed two dietary patterns:
one in which vegetables, fruit, whole grains, low fat dairy,
poultry, Ô¨Åsh and Ô¨Åber consumption increased across
quintiles (prudent dietary pattern), and the other in
which consumption of reÔ¨Åned grains, red meat, processed
meat, high-fat dairy, saturated fat and dessert increased
across quintiles (western dietary pattern). Neither dietary
pattern was related to breast cancer mortality. However,
the prudent dietary pattern reduced and Western dietary
pattern increased deaths from other causes. Thus, the
no-association result for dietary fat consumption was
consistent across these two overlapping cohorts, but
the conclusions for a mortality association with the con-
sumption of vegetables, fruit and Ô¨Åber were not.

The Women‚Äôs Healthy Eating and Living (WHEL)
Study reported observational data from women random-
ized to the comparison group. Dietary assessment
occurred an average of 2 years after diagnosis, and dietary
patterns were validated with a plasma carotenoid con-

centration, the accepted biomarker of vegetable and fruit
intake. The Ô¨Årst report [19] focused on 205 women who
had a breast cancer event prior to June 2004 (average of
5 years follow-up), and identiÔ¨Åed those in the lowest
baseline tertile (compared to all others) of circulating
carotenoid concentrations as having an approximate 40%
increased risk. The second report [24] focused on over-
all mortality and included follow-up through December
2005. No association was found for energy from fat.
Vegetable‚Äìfruit consumption and physical activity were
weakly associated by themselves, but there was an inter-
action between them with the combination of vegetable‚Äì
fruit intake (at least 5 vegetables and fruits/day), and
physical activity (equivalent
to walking briskly for
30 min, 6 days a week) reduced the risk of dying from
breast cancer by half, regardless of weight, although fewer
obese women were physically active with a healthy
dietary pattern (16 versus 30%). The effect was stronger
in women who had hormone receptor-positive cancers.

Comparing Women‚Äôs Healthy Eating and Living and
Women‚Äôs Intervention Nutrition Study randomized trials
Both the Women‚Äôs Intervention Nutrition Study (WINS)
and the WHEL Study randomized women who had been
diagnosed with early stage breast cancer in the United
States during the period from 1990 to 1999, before the
widespread use of aromatase inhibitors. Both studies
excluded stage I patients with <1 cm tumors, but there
were three important differences in the eligibility criteria.
The Ô¨Årst was age: WINS enrolled postmenopausal
women aged 48‚Äì79 years at diagnosis, whereas WHEL
enrolled women aged 18‚Äì70 years. However, to compare
studies, it is possible to categorize WHEL participants by
menopausal status (Table 1). Both the WHEL (n¬º 2448)
and the WINS (n¬º 2437) studies had almost equiva-
lently-sized populations of postmenopausal women.

The second difference was the time between diagnosis
and enrollment. WINS enrolled women within 1 year of
diagnosis, whereas the WHEL Study enrolled women
within 4 years of diagnosis (Table 1). Thus, the WHEL
Study undersampled the population who would recur
within 4 years of diagnosis and is really a study of breast
cancer events between 2 and 10 years from diagnosis [25].
WINS, on the contrary, is focused much more on breast
cancer events within the Ô¨Årst 5 years from diagnosis.
The third difference was that WINS excluded women
with worse prognoses (based on tumor size and nodes),
whereas WHEL postmenopausal women had more
advanced cancer characteristics at diagnosis. Over half
of WINS participants were stage I compared with just
over a third of the WHEL sample, and 25% of WHEL
women were stage IIB or IIIA, compared with only 10%
of WINS. In both studies, about one-Ô¨Åfth of postmeno-
pausal women had estrogen receptor-negative tumors at
diagnosis.

Despite the above differences in cancer characteristics,
both studies recruited breast cancer survivors from similar
populations. Socio-demographic characteristics of WINS
and WHEL participants were markedly similar (Table 2)
in terms of age (55 versus 58 years), race (85% were
Caucasian) and education (almost 50% college gradu-
ates). Approximately 27% of postmenopausal participants
in both studies were obese, and the mean energy intake
from fat was 29%.

These WINS and WHEL comparisons include WHEL
participants who were premenopausal and perimenopau-
sal. These women were younger, more highly educated
and less likely to be obese (Table 2). They were also
more likely to be recruited in the Ô¨Årst year and more
likely to be estrogen receptor negative (Table 1).

intake [26] (Table 3). Although it appeared that this
between-group difference was maintained through 5 years,
the low response rate for dietary assessments makes this
result questionable (year 3 response approximately 70%;
year 5 response approximately 40%). In reporting a com-
pleters-only analysis, the authors assumed that diets of the
large proportion of nonrespondents were similar to the
diets of the respondents ‚Äì a very questionable assumption.
Using a more conservative assumption (that nonrespon-
dents didn‚Äôt lower their fat intake), an estimate of the
between-group difference is approximately 6% at year 3
and 3.5% at year 5. WINS also reported that the interven-
tion group lost weight, resulting in a between-group
difference of 2.3 kg in year 1 (conservative assump-
tion¬º approximately 1.6 kg) to 2.7 kg in year 5 (conser-
vative assumption¬º approximately 1.1 kg).

The effect of the Women‚Äôs Intervention Nutrition Study
intervention
Both the WINS and the WHEL studies used sets of four
24 h recalls to assess current dietary pattern at multiple
points in time. The WINS intervention focused on redu-
cing fat intake to 15% of energy. At 1 year, the intervention
reported a 9% between-group difference in dietary fat

The effect of the Women‚Äôs Healthy Eating and Living
Study intervention
The WHEL Study intervention encouraged women to
adopt a daily dietary pattern including Ô¨Åve vegetable
servings, 16 oz of vegetable juice, three fruit servings,
30 g of Ô¨Åber and 20% energy from fat. Unlike WINS,
there was only a small decline in completion rates for

dietary assessment and 85% were assessed at year 6
(Table 4). The study has presented dietary change data
in two ways: using a completers-only analysis [24] as
well as with the conservative assumption that nonrespon-
ders did not change their dietary pattern [27].

To compare dietary change with WINS, we present the
completers-only data in Table 4 [24]. The intervention
was associated with a between-group difference of 4.7
vegetable‚Äìfruit servings/day at 1 year that decreased to 3
servings/day by 6 years. The between-group difference
for Ô¨Åber consumption was 8 g/day at year 1, decreasing to
5 g/day at year 6. The between-group difference in
energy from fat was 5.7% at 1 year, decreasing to 3.5%
at 6 years, similar to the conservative estimate of the
WINS intervention effect. Body weight changed little
over 6 years. The conservative analysis concluded that, at
4 years, the relative between-group differences were 65%
for vegetables (including juice), 25% for fruit, 30% for
Ô¨Åber and 13% for energy from fat.

Study outcomes: Women‚Äôs Intervention Nutrition Study
versus Women‚Äôs Healthy Eating and Living Study
The WINS and the WHEL studies have reported con-
Ô¨Çicting results. WINS assessed the summary variable ‚Äòany
breast cancer event‚Äô for their analysis and the 2.6%
between-group difference was borderline signiÔ¨Åcant in
the planned stratiÔ¨Åed log rank test (P¬º 0.077), although
statistically signiÔ¨Åcant in the multivariate Cox model
(P¬º 0.034) [26]. Further, an exploratory analysis suggested
that the between-group differences in breast cancer events
might be conÔ¨Åned to the 20% of the sample with initial
tumors that were estrogen receptor negative; however, the
interaction between dietary intervention and hormone
receptor status was not statistically signiÔ¨Åcant.

The WHEL Study [24] reported no between-group
differences in either any breast cancer event [adjusted
Hazard Ratio (HRadj)¬º 0.63] or in overall mortality
(HRadj¬º 0.43). Additionally, for breast cancer events,
the likelihood ratio tests for baseline dietary pattern by
study group interaction were not signiÔ¨Åcant for veg-
etable‚Äìfruit, Ô¨Åber or energy from fat. However, for over-
all mortality, the likelihood ratio test was signiÔ¨Åcant for
quartiles of energy from fat (P¬º 0.04), although the effect
seemed to be only in the second quartile of baseline
energy from fat, and the intervention group difference
was not in a protective direction. Further, hormone
receptor status did not differ between groups (P¬º 0.85).

Given the considerable similarities between these
randomized trials, the marked difference in these Ô¨Åndings
requires further investigation. Table 5 presents details
of the different study outcomes for postmenopausal
women. As expected, from the initial cancer characteristics
(Table 1) and the longer follow-up period, WHEL
reported more study events than WINS (Table 5) and
particularly more distal recurrences that Tang [28] has
argued are the most important study outcomes for patients
with a preexisting breast cancer diagnosis. The size of the
between-group difference in these distal recurrences was
not that different for both of these studies (WINS¬º 1.1,
WHEL¬º 0.9).

The difference in the studies occurred in the between-
group differences in the proportion of women who had
local recurrences and new primary breast cancer events
(WINS¬º 1.3%, WHEL¬º√æ0.5%), and, in particular,
the WINS group effect was among women who had a
lumpectomy for their initial cancer and had an ipsilateral
breast cancer recurrence during the follow-up period

(comparison¬º 2.1%; intervention¬º 1.1%). It is possible
that the lack of a WHEL effect in this subpopulation of
women reÔ¨Çected the fact that WHEL underestimated
events in the Ô¨Årst few years from diagnosis. Another
plausible explanation is that this Ô¨Ånding is an artifact,
particularly as the main hypothesis was only marginally
statistically signiÔ¨Åcant.

Women‚Äôs Healthy Eating and Living Study secondary
analysis
The initial WHEL Study protocol [25] postulated that
diet could affect prognosis by reducing circulating estrogen
concentrations. The study‚Äôs nested case‚Äìcontrol analysis
showed that women with higher circulating estradiol con-
centrations at baseline were less likely to report hot Ô¨Çashes
at that time and more likely to have a secondary cancer
event during the follow-up period [29]. In two separate
studies, early stage breast cancer survivors who did not
report hot Ô¨Çashes shortly after treatment were approxi-
mately 30% more likely to have additional breast cancer
events [30,31]. Given that the WHEL Study intervention
has been shown to reduce circulating estrogen concen-
trations [32], the study undertook a secondary analysis to
see whether an intervention effect may have been limited
to this group of women who did not report hot Ô¨Çashes at
baseline [33].
About one-third of WHEL participants (n¬º 900) were in
the subgroup who did not report hot Ô¨Çashes at baseline
(no hot Ô¨Çash subgroup) [24,33]. The intervention
participants in this no hot Ô¨Çash subgroup had a similarly
large change in dietary pattern (vegetables, fruit, Ô¨Åber
and energy from fat) over the course of the study to that
seen in the overall intervention group. Among the no hot
Ô¨Çash subgroup, 76.4% of the comparison group and 83.9%
of the intervention group remained breast cancer free
(P¬º 0.002). This effect was almost entirely restricted to
the distal recurrence group (comparison¬º 15.9%, inter-
vention¬º 9.4%), and the approximately 60% lower event
rate in the intervention group was not explained by other

variables in a series of sensitivity analyses [33]. This
effect did not differ signiÔ¨Åcantly by hormone receptor
status (P¬º 0.63).

Conclusion
The evidence from prospective observational studies is
mixed particularly for vegetable‚Äìfruit‚ÄìÔ¨Åber consumption,
though more consistently negative for fat consumption.
Two randomized trials have been reported: WINS focused
on the dietary fat hypothesis, whereas WHEL focused on a
plant-based dietary pattern that included a reduction in
dietary fat. WHEL reported that the comprehensive
dietary change had no effect on prognosis, whereas WINS
found a marginal positive effect from changing fat.

This review compares postmenopausal participants from
these studies, focusing on what might explain the differ-
ent results. Both studies indicate that dietary pattern is
not a strong ‚Äòacross the board‚Äô predictor of prognosis.
Each study suggests that the dietary pattern may be
effective within a subgroup of people. Further investi-
gation of subgroups is required, particularly focused on
population evidence of the mechanism by which these
dietary patterns may impact prognosis.

for breast cancer: the women‚Äôs healthy eating and living (WHEL) randomized
trial. JAMA 2007; 298:289‚Äì298.

This paper in a major general medical journal presents the results of the WHEL
randomized trial (n¬º 3088) reporting both breast cancer-free survival and overall
survival. Subgroup analyses are included for dietary pattern at the start of the trial. The
trial had conÔ¨Årmed health status at 96% of both study groups after trial completion.
The Kaplan‚ÄìMeier curves from randomized groups with major biomarker-validated
differences in dietary pattern were superimposed for both recurrence and mortality.

Study. J Clin Oncol (in press).

This paper presents the WHEL study data by hot Ô¨Çash status, and demonstrated
that there was a major reduction in risk of distal events in the intervention group for
those who did not have hot Ô¨Çashes at baseline (and hence were at increased risk).
Numerous sensitivity analyses demonstrated the robustness of this Ô¨Ånding.
