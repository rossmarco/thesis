ABSTRACT Meat consumption, particularly of red and processed meat, is one of the most thoroughly studied
dietary factors in relation to colon cancer. However, it is not clear whether meat, red meat, heterocyclic amines
(HCA), or polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) are associated with the risk for rectal cancer. Rectal cancer
cases (n ⫽ 952) and controls (n ⫽ 1205) from Utah and Northern California were recruited from a population-based
case-control study between September 1997 and February 2002. Detailed in-person interviews regarding lifestyle,
medical history, and diet were conducted. DNA was extracted from peripheral
lymphocytes obtained from
whole-blood samples, and glutathione S-transferase (GST)M1 enzyme and N-acetyl transferase (NAT)2 enzyme
genotypes were assessed. Although energy and cholesterol
intakes were higher among cases than controls,
adjustment for confounders accounted for the differences. Increased consumption of well-done red meat [odds
ratio (OR) 1.33 95% CI 0.98, 1.79] was associated with an (P ⫽ 0.04) increase in risk for rectal cancer among men.
The mutagen index, calculated on the bases of reported amount, doneness, and method of cooking meat, was also
positively but not signiﬁcantly (P ⫽ 0.24) associated with risk of rectal cancer for men (OR 1.37 95% CI 0.98, 1.92).
NAT2-imputed phenotype and GSTM1 did not consistently modify rectal cancer risk associated with meat intake.
These data suggest that mutagens such as HCA that form when meat is cooked may be culpable substances in
rectal cancer risk, not red meat itself.

Meat consumption, particularly red and processed meat
consumption, is one of the most thoroughly studied dietary
risk factors for colon cancer. Meat was examined initially
because of its fat content, which could inﬂuence the bile acid
content of the gut, but has been studied more recently with
regard to other attributes. Mutagen content (1,2), meat prep-
aration (2), the role of meat in dietary patterns (3), and types
of meat (4 – 6) have been studied. On the bases of other risk
factors and site-speciﬁc analyses reported, it is highly plausible
that the risk factors for colon and rectal cancer may be
different. Some studies report stronger associations for distal
tumors than proximal (7), although few studies have reported
the association of meat consumption with risk for rectal cancer
alone (2).

It is not clear whether the association between meat con-
sumption and colorectal cancer is from the consumption of

meat, or if it arises from meat preparation methods that gen-
erate higher
levels of carcinogenic heterocyclic amines
(HCAs),4 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), or other
compounds. HCAs are formed as a by-product of reactions
during the cooking of meat (beef, pork,
lamb), poultry
(chicken) and ﬁsh especially when they are char-broiled or
roasted (8 –14). Dietary exposure to HCAs has been a sus-
pected risk factor for colorectal cancer since the 1970s (15).
Exposure to PAH in food is one of the primary sources of
exposure to PAH in the United States (16).

An inherited variation in metabolism of HCA and PAH
compounds may modify cancer risk associated with these ex-
posures. Metabolism of certain mutagenic forms of PAH can
be detoxiﬁed by the glutathione S-transferase (GST)M1 en-
zyme. The GSTM1 null variant associated with no activity
may, therefore, be associated with altered risk of cancers (17).
The N-acetyl transferase (NAT)2 enzyme catalyzes O-acety-
lation of HCAs to form compounds that bind covalently to
DNA (18); therefore, inherited low-activity variants may play
a role in the etiology of rectal cancer.

MEAT, ENZYME VARIANTS, AND RECTAL CANCER

777

We previously reported a slight increase in risk of colon
cancer among men with the highest consumption of processed
meat [odds ratio (OR) 1.4 95% CI 1.0 –1.9] and the highest
level of mutagen index (an estimate of exposure to mutagenic
or carcinogenic substances, OR 1.3 95% CI 1.0 –1.7) (1).
Although no independent associations with colon cancer were
observed for NAT2 and GSTM1 genotypes, associations with
processed meat consumption (OR 1.5 95% CI 1.1–2.0) and
the mutagen index (OR 1.3, 95% CI 1.0 –1.7) were increased
among those with the intermediate or rapid type acetylator
phenotype. Interestingly, the associations of the mutagen in-
dex were stronger among both men and women with distal
colon tumors compared with those with proximal tumors. The
possibility that PAH may be directly related to rectal cancer
risk or interact with PAH exposure is supported by the ﬁnding
that GSTM1 absent genotypes are found more frequently
among adenocarcinomas than in noncancerous polyps (7) and
more distally in the intestinal tract (37% in the right colon,
44% in left colon, and 60% in the rectum).

We hypothesized that NAT2-imputed phenotype and
GSTM1 genotype may interact with meat consumption or
meat preparation to alter rectal cancer risk. Using methodol-
ogy and variable deﬁnitions similar to those of our previous
study (1), we investigated whether the associations between
meat consumption, meat preparation method and the risk for
rectal cancer in men and women from Utah and California
were modiﬁed by NAT2 imputed phenotype and GSTM1
genotype.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS

Participants. The institutional review boards at each participat-
ing institution approved the methods. Cases with a ﬁrst primary
tumor in the rectosigmoid junction or rectum were identiﬁed between
May 1997 and May 2001 using a rapid-reporting system. Case eligi-
bility was determined in Northern California by the Surveillance
Epidemiology and End Results Cancer Registries and in Utah using a
rapid-reporting system. An on-line pathology reporting system was
searched for rapid case ascertainment of rectal cancer cases at Kaiser
Permanente Northern California Cancer Registry (KPMCP). Cases
identiﬁed were conﬁrmed through linkage to the KPMCP. Cases with
a previous colorectal tumor were not eligible for the study. Cases with
known (as indicated on the pathology report) familial adenomatous
polyposis, ulcerative colitis, or Crohn’s disease were not eligible. In
addition to these criteria, participants were between 30 and 79 y old
at time of diagnosis, English speaking, and mentally competent to
complete the interview.

Controls were frequency matched to cases by sex and by 5-y age
groups. Education level and ethnicity did not differ between cases and
controls of each gender (19). At the KPMCP, controls were randomly
selected from membership lists, and in Utah, controls ⱖ65 y old were
randomly selected from social security lists and controls ⬍65 y old
were randomly selected from driver’s license lists. The race/ethnicity
of the study population was reported at the time of interview as 82%
white, non-Hispanic, 7.3% Hispanic white, 4.1% African American,
not Hispanic, 0.2% Hispanic African American, 4.6% Asian, 0.7%
American Indian, and 1.1% multiple races/ethnicity. A total of 952
rectal cancer cases and 1205 matched controls are included in the
analyses presented. Response rates were 65.2% for cases and 65.3%
for controls; cooperation rates, or the number of people who partic-
ipated from those whom we were able to contact, were 73.2% for
cases and 68.8% for controls.

Interview. Diet and other exposure data were collected during
in-person interviews conducted by trained and certiﬁed interviewers
using laptop computers. The interview took ⬃2 h. Quality control
methods used in the study were the same as those used in the colon
cancer study and were described in detail elsewhere (7,8).

Diet. Dietary intake was ascertained using an adaptation of the
CARDIA diet history (8,12). Participants were asked to recall foods
eaten for the calendar year occurring 2 y before their cancer diagnosis

(cases) or recruitment into the study (controls), the frequency that
they were eaten, serving size, and whether fats were added in the
preparation. Nutrient information was obtained by converting food
intake data into nutrient data using the Minnesota Nutrition Coor-
dinating Center nutrient database Version 4.04_30. Additional in-
formation was gathered on usual doneness of meats (rare, medium-
rare, medium-well done, and well done). Participants were asked how
frequently red meats, ﬁsh, and poultry were fried, broiled, baked, or
barbequed (cooked at high temperatures) and how frequently drip-
pings were used in other foods or gravies. Variables included servings
of particular foods or food groups (i.e., red meat, poultry, and red meat
drippings) consumed per day, week, or year. The mutagen index was
calculated as the frequency of red meat, poultry, and ﬁsh consumption
prepared by frying, broiling, baking, or barbecuing plus the use of
drippings from red meat, poultry, or ﬁsh, multiplied by the usual
doneness of red meat, poultry, and ﬁsh (1 ⫽ rare, 2 ⫽ medium rare,
3 ⫽ medium-well, and 4 ⫽ well done) and the microwave factor (1
⫽ microwave never used or used for thawing, 0.75 ⫽ sometimes used,
0.50 ⫽ often used, 0.25 ⫽ always used). A higher index reﬂects a
higher intake of potentially mutagenic compounds.

Genetic data. Blood was drawn from study participants and
DNA was extracted. The GSTM1 null and present genotypes were
detected using the multiplex PCR method described by Zhong and
colleagues (20). The PCR products were run on a 2% agarose gel and
stained with ethidium bromide. If the only product displayed is the
157 bp gene fragment, it is classiﬁed as GSTM1 null, whereas if both
bands are present, it is classiﬁed as GSTM1 present.

Three variants of NAT2 were assessed, using the method of Bell
et al. (21) to determine acetylator status of three variants that
account for ⬃90 –95% of the slow acetylation phenotype in Cauca-
sians. All three variants could be identiﬁed from one PCR product
and be digested with three different restriction enzymes. The C481T
variant was determined using a Kpn1 digest, the G590A variant using
a Taq1 digest, and the G857A variant using a Bam H1 digest.
Subjects with at least 2 variant alleles were classiﬁed as slow acety-
lators, whereas those with 1 or 0 variant alleles were classiﬁed as fast
acetylators.

Other information. Height (m) and weight (kg) were measured at
the time of interview, and weight was reported for the 2 and 5 y before
the interview. The BMI (kg/m2) was calculated for men and women.
Physical activity data were collected using a detailed questionnaire
(19,22). Estrogen-negative status was deﬁned as postmenopausal women
not taking hormone replacement and estrogen-positive status was de-
ﬁned as premenopausal women and postmenopausal women taking hor-
mone replacement.

Statistical methods. The SAS statistical package, version 8.2, CA,
was used to conduct the analysis. We previously observed gender differ-
ences in diet-gene interactions associated with the risk of rectal cancer;
therefore, gender-stratiﬁed analyses were pursued. Dietary data were
assessed by determining risk across true medians, thirds, or quartiles of
intake, or by other speciﬁc cut-off values deﬁned for previous analyses (1)
depending on the distribution of the data. The true medians, thirds, or
quartiles were determined by the sex-speciﬁc intake distribution in the
control population. In these models, the following variables were in-
cluded: age at selection, BMI, physical activity, energy intake, dietary
ﬁber, dietary calcium, and cigarette smoking status. Further confounding
by cancer screening was assessed, but was found not to signiﬁcantly
confound associations. Linear trend was determined by evaluating the
signiﬁcance of linear association across the categorized variable. GSTM1
was analyzed as being present or absent; NAT2-imputed phenotype was
analyzed as either slow or intermediate/rapid imputed. Interaction or
effect modiﬁcations between meat-related variables and GSTM1 and
NAT2-imputed phenotype were evaluated as the excess risk on both
additive (23) and multiplicative scales. Interactions between meat and
meat preparation variables and combinations of the genotypes or im-
puted phenotype were also evaluated on both additive and multiplicative
scales.

Dietary intakes of cases and controls are described in Table

proportion of energy intake from fat and protein did not differ
between cases and controls of both genders. Cholesterol intake
(mg/d) was greater among cases than controls of both genders.
Female cases consumed more red meat (servings/wk) and pro-
cessed meat (servings/wk) than female controls.

We reported previously that there were no signiﬁcant as-
sociations between NAT2 and GSTM1 genotypes and the risk
of rectal cancer in men or women (24). Approximately 45% of
men and 50% of women had the rapid acetylator NAT2-
imputed phenotype. The GSTM1 present genotype occurred
in ⬃49% of men and 45% of women.

We examined the association of intake of red and processed
meats and poultry with risk of rectal cancer and found no
signiﬁcant trends in men or women after adjustment for pos-
sible confounders of the association with rectal cancer (Tables
2 and 3). Further adjustment for sigmoidoscopy during the
past 10 y did not change the interpretation of the results (data
not shown). Although there was a tendency toward increased
risk above the lowest level of intake of processed meats in
women and among men in the highest tertile of intake, the
associations were not signiﬁcant (P for trend ⫽ 0.31 and 0.28,
respectively).

When we examined the association of aspects of meat
consumption and preparation with the risk of rectal cancer,
risk increased among men who reported eating fried, broiled,

baked, or barbequed white meat more than 2 times/mo (Table
2). Risk increased ⬃33% among men who reported consuming
well-done red meats (P ⫽ 0.04), 39% with the highest red
meat mutagen index (P ⫽ 0.04), and increased nearly 40% (P
⫽ 0.04) among men with a high overall mutagen index.
Further adjustment for sigmoidoscopy did not signiﬁcantly
alter the results (data not shown). Stratiﬁcation by age (⬍65
y vs. ⱖ65 y) did not reveal consistent differences in risks by
age (data not shown). Among women, there was no associa-
tion of frequent consumption of red meat, preparing foods at
high temperatures, or mutagen indices and the risk of rectal
cancer. However, consumption of red meat drippings ⱖ1
time/wk was associated with an unexpected nonsigniﬁcant
decrease in risk of rectal cancer (P ⫽ 0.27).

We also examined the interaction of meat consumption,
preparation, and mutagen index with NAT2-imputed pheno-
type and GSTM1 genotypes by gender. The associations of
meat consumption and preparation with risk of rectal cancer
generally did not differ between those with the slow NAT2
imputed phenotype and those with the rapid or intermediate
acetylator phenotype (Tables 4 and 5). Among men (Table
4), consumption of well-done red meat was associated with a
greater increase in risk among those who were rapid acetylators
(P for multiplicative interaction ⫽ 0.09) compared with those
who were slow acetylators. However, risk was increased with a

Among women (Table 5), having the rapid or intermediate
phenotype and/or consumption of ⬎4.2 servings of red meat
per week, particularly among estrogen-negative women (n
⫽ 15 cases, 28 controls, OR 0.27 95% CI 0.10 – 0.74), or a

negative women (n ⫽ 12 cases, 13 controls OR 0.47 95% CI
0.14 –1.57) was associated with an unexpected [relative excess
risk due to interaction (RERI), P ⫽ 0.01, P for multiplicative
interaction ⫽ 0.14] reduced risk of rectal cancer. Rectal cancer
risk decreased among women who were slow acetylators and
who ate high levels of red meat drippings; this was particularly
true for estrogen-positive women (n ⫽ 23 cases, 29 controls,
OR 0.34 95% CI 0.17, 0.68). Further adjustment for screening
by sigmoidoscopy did not substantially change results (data not
shown).

Among men with the GSTM1 absent genotype, high levels
of the red meat mutagen index resulted in increased risk of
rectal cancer (OR 1.72 95% CI 1.04, 2.83) compared with
men with the GSTM1 genotype present (RERI P ⫽ 0.15)
(Table 6). The risk associated with meat and meat preparation
variables tended (P ⬎ 0.05) to be lower among women with
the GSTM1 null than the GSTM1 present genotype (Table
7). Unexpectedly, higher risk was observed among those
women with the GSTM1 present genotype who consumed the

smallest amount of poultry, particularly estrogen-positive
women (n ⫽ 28 cases, 22, controls OR 2.87 95% CI 1.34,
6.17). A lower risk of rectal cancer was also observed among
women with the GSTM1 present genotype, a low white meat
mutagen index (RERI P ⫽ 0.17, P for multiplicative interac-
tion ⫽ 0.29), and overall mutagen index (RERI P ⫽ 0.83, P
for multiplicative interaction ⫽ 0.54), although the interac-
tions were not signiﬁcant. Among women with the GSTM1
present genotype, there was a twofold increase in risk associ-
ated with high processed meat intake relative to women with
the GSTM1 absent genotype and low intake of processed
meats, particularly among estrogen-negative women (n ⫽ 34
cases, 22 controls OR 2.68 95% CI 1.02, 7.05).

DISCUSSION

The present study does not support a strong association
between red, white, or processed meat consumption and the
risk of rectal cancer in men or women. Results for doneness of
meat and mutagen index are consistent with the hypothesis
that HCAs are responsible for the increase in risk for rectal
cancer in men. Unexpectedly, in women, use of red meat
drippings was associated with a decreased risk of rectal cancer.
This decrease was greater among women with the slow NAT2-
imputed phenotype and the GSTM-1 absent genotype.

Our results are in contrast with earlier work on the associ-
ation of meat with rectal cancer (2,25) and colorectal cancer
(26 –28). A Dutch prospective study suggested an increased
risk of colorectal cancer with increased red meat intake among
men, but a decreased risk associated with poultry and ﬁsh
intake among women, which might be accounted for by the
substitution of poultry and ﬁsh for red meat (28). Among
Chinese in Singapore, protein and the ratio of meat:vegetable
consumption were inversely associated with the risk for rectal
cancer (3). Senesse et al. (29) observed opposite associations
of fatty meats (positive) and lean meats (inverse) with the risk
of adenomas in the right and left colon and rectum, suggesting
that associations with rectal cancer could be substantially
inﬂuenced by the composition of total meat intake or in the
context of the whole diet. It is difﬁcult to assess whether these
different ﬁndings are related to differences in study methods,
study populations, usual diets, and/or proportions of meats or
preparation methods of meat in the diet.

Our results suggest a modest, nonsigniﬁcant increase in the
risk of rectal cancer with consumption of well-done meat and
white meat cooked at high temperatures (fried, baked, broiled,
or barbecued) among men. A Swedish case-control study
reported (2) a positive association of well-browned meats with
rectal cancer, but did not report whether the results differed if

they were stratiﬁed by gender. Our failure to ﬁnd an associa-
tion with meat intake per se suggests that HCAs or other
carcinogens created by cooking meat at high temperatures
could be responsible for the increase in risk. The biological
plausibility is supported by the ﬁnding that the HCA 2-amino-
3– 8 dimethylimidazo quinoxaline (4,5) was associated with an
increase in the risk for colorectal adenomas even after adjust-
ing for consumption of red meat, suggesting that the HCA was
the culpable substance, not red meat.

It is not immediately clear why gender differences were
observed, but differences in background diet, levels of expo-
sure, and metabolism cannot be ruled out. We examined
gender differences because of our previous ﬁndings of differ-
ences in associations of intake of antioxidants to rectal cancer
by gender (30). Although some ﬁndings were evident only in
estrogen-positive or estrogen-negative women, small cell sizes
limit our conﬁdence in such ﬁndings. Any explanation at this
point would be speculative and would have to be veriﬁed in
other populations. It is also possible that these are chance
ﬁndings with no biological relevance.

We found that acetylator status appeared to modify the risk
of rectal cancer, but not consistently in the direction expected.
In agreement with our previous report on colon cancer (1),
men who had the rapid or intermediate acetylator phenotype

and who consumed well-done meat had a greater increase in
the risk for rectal cancer than men with the slow acetylator
imputed phenotype. In women with the NAT2 slow acetylator
imputed phenotype, use of red meat drippings at least once a
week was associated with a decreased risk for rectal cancer. It
is expected that for substances for which N-acetylation is a
detoxiﬁcation step, NAT2 slow acetylators are at increased
risk, but for substances for which O-acetylation is an activa-
tion step, rapid acetylators would be expected to be at greater
risk (31). It is not clear whether our ﬁndings actually represent
differential risks from N-acetylation and O-acetylation be-
cause they could arise from multiple comparisons, residual
confounding, interaction with another phase I or II metabo-
lizing enzyme, or reﬂection of the metabolism of some other
substance.

Although the possibility that PAH may be directly related
to rectal cancer risk is supported by the ﬁnding that GSTM1
absent genotypes are found more frequently among cancerous
tissues than in noncancerous tissues (7) and more distally in
the intestinal tract, we found little evidence to support a direct
association of GSTM1 genotype to risk for rectal cancer. An
inverse association of ﬁsh or poultry to risk for colorectal
cancer among those with GSTM1 present genotypes was re-
ported (28) and attributed to residual confounding of other
healthy habits. Although we did not ﬁnd an inverse associa-
tion with ﬁsh or poultry and rectal cancer risk, residual con-

founding of other healthy habits is plausible because PAH may
be found in cereals and grain products, fruits, vegetables, and
processed meat.

Heterocyclic amines and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons
were not directly measured in this study. Instead, we inferred
their intake from responses to questions about preference for
doneness of meat and preparation method. Recall may be
different for cases than controls based on the momentous
event of cancer diagnosis, thus creating a potential bias in
reported information. Strengths of the study include in-depth
dietary assessment and questioning regarding meat preparation
as well as rigorous quality control procedures (7,8). Gender
differences are difﬁcult to reconcile; however, few studies have
shown gender-speciﬁc interactions of gene-environment asso-
ciations, likely due to sample size issues. These ﬁndings, based
on the largest case-control study of diet, lifestyle, and rectal
cancer, enable us to assess potential gender-speciﬁc interac-
tions with metabolic enzyme polymorphisms and add to the
knowledge base for the etiology of rectal cancer.
