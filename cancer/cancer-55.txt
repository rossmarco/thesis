ABSTRACT Emerging evidence suggests that diet quality indices may serve as prognostic indicators of disease.
However, the ability of these indices to predict breast cancer risk has not been evaluated previously. We assessed
the association between several diet quality scores and the risk of breast cancer in postmenopausal women. The
indices we used were the Healthy Eating Index (HEI), Alternate Healthy Eating Index (AHEI), Diet Quality Index-
Revised (DQI-R), Recommended Food Score (RFS), and the alternate Mediterranean Diet Score (aMed). We
calculated diet quality indices from dietary information collected in FFQ administered 5 times between 1984 and 1998
among women in the Nurses‚Äô Health Study cohort. Relative risks (RR) were computed using Cox proportional
hazards models and adjusted for known risk factors for breast cancer. Separate analyses were conducted for
estrogen receptor positive (ER1) and negative (ER√ø) tumors. Between 1984 and 2002, we documented 3580 cases
of breast cancer, of which 2367 were ER1, and 575 were ER√ø. We did not observe any association between the diet
quality indices and total or ER1 breast cancer risk. However, for ER√ø breast cancer, after adjusting for potential
confounders, the RR comparing highest to lowest quintiles were 0.78 (95% CI ¬º 0.59‚Äì1.04, P for trend ¬º 0.01) for the
AHEI, 0.69 (95% CI ¬º 0.51‚Äì0.94, P for trend ¬º 0.003) for the RFS, and 0.79 (95% CI ¬º 0.60‚Äì1.03, P for trend ¬º 0.03)
for the aMed. These observations appeared to be the result of an inverse association (P for trend ¬º 0.01) with the
vegetable component of the scores. We conclude that women who scored high in AHEI, RFS, and aMed had a lower
risk of ER√ø breast cancer. The HEI and DQI-R appeared to be of limited value in predicting breast cancer risk. J.

Several diet quality indices have been developed to evaluate
the healthfulness of individual diets. These indices are usually
based on established nutrient requirements and well-publicized
dietary guidelines. However, diet indices have not been tested
extensively in their ability to predict the risk of chronic dis-
eases. Previous studies focused on diet quality in relation to
total mortality or incidence of broad categories of diseases (1‚Äì
3). A strategy that combines all cancers together may not
provide full insight because both dietary risk factors and the
strength of association often differ by cancer site. For breast
cancer, there are few established dietary risk factors other than
alcohol (4), indicating that individual dietary factors in adult
life have weak if any effect on breast cancer risk. It is therefore
worthwhile to examine whether overall diet patterns affect risk,
perhaps through additive or interactive effects of dietary
behaviors not captured in studies of single nutrients.

We examined prospectively the association between several
diet quality indices and the risk of breast cancer in postmeno-
pausal women. The scores used in this study were Healthy
Eating Index (HEI),3 Alternate Healthy Eating Index (AHEI),
Diet Quality Index-Revised (DQIR), Recommended Food Score
(RFS), and the alternate Mediterranean Diet Score (aMed).
We also considered breast cancer tumors according to estrogen
receptor (ER) status because evidence suggests that risk may
vary by ER status (5).

health-related information (6). Since 1976, questionnaires have been
sent biennially to update exposures and disease outcome status.
Follow-up was complete for .95% of the potential person time up to
2002. In 1980, the participants completed a 61-item FFQ. In 1984, the
FFQ was expanded to 116 items. Similar FFQ were sent to the women
in 1986, 1990, 1994, and 1998. We considered 1984 as baseline for
this analysis because the expanded number of food items on the longer
questionnaire was critical in calculating diet quality scores. The NHS is
approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Brigham and
Women‚Äôs Hospital, Boston, MA.

For the present analysis, women were included if they completed
the 1984 FFQ with ,70 missing items and had a total energy intake
range (as calculated from the FFQ) between 2060 and 14420 kJ/d (500
and 3500 kcal/d). Women with a history of cancer, except for non-
melanoma skin cancers, were excluded. Thus, we included 71,058 women
in this analysis with follow-up for up to 18 y, from 1984 to 2002.

Assessment of dietary intake. Dietary intake information was
collected by FFQ designed to assess average food intake over the
previous year. A standard portion size was given for each food item.
Cohort members were asked to choose from 9 possible frequency of
consumption responses, ranging from ‚Äò‚Äònever‚Äô‚Äô to ‚Äò‚Äòmore than 6 times
a day‚Äô‚Äô for each food. Total energy intake was calculated by summing
the energy intake from all foods. For this analysis, we used information
from the FFQ administered in 1984, 1986, 1990, 1994, and 1998.
Previous validation studies among members of the NHS cohort
revealed good correlations between nutrients assessed by the FFQ and
multiple weeks of food records completed over the previous year (7).
For example, correlation coefÔ¨Åcients between the 1986 FFQ and diet
records obtained in 1986 were 0.68 for saturated fat, 0.76 for vitamin
C, and 0.73 for dietary cholesterol. The mean correlation coefÔ¨Åcient
between frequencies of intake of 55 foods from 2 FFQ 12 mo apart was
0.57 (8).

Scoring criteria for each diet quality index were described in detail
elsewhere. A brief description is presented in the Appendix. For each
index, a higher score represents a more healthful diet. Calculation of
the HEI was based on criteria set in The Healthy Eating Index Final
Report and adapted to this cohort by McCullough et al. (2,9). BrieÔ¨Çy,
the HEI contains 10 components consisting of grains, vegetables, fruit,
milk, meat, total fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, sodium, and diet
variety. These criteria reÔ¨Çect recommendations based on the USDA
Food Guide Pyramid (10) and the 1995 Dietary Guidelines for
Americans (11). Possible scores from each component ranged from 0 to
10, depending on level of intake, with a possible total score of 100 for
the HEI. The AHEI scoring criteria (12) differed from those of the
original HEI; it addressed quality within food groups by removing
potatoes from vegetables, and including fruit, nuts and soy, white/red
meat ratio, trans fat and the polyunsaturated:saturated fat ratio, cereal
Ô¨Åber, and adding long-term multivitamin use, and alcohol intake. The
possible score for the multivitamin component was either 2.5 or 7.5 to
avoid overweighting. The AHEI was based on 9 items, with a maxi-
mum possible score of 87.5.

The RFS was developed by Kant et al. (1) and adapted by
McCullough et al. (12) for our FFQ. The RFS focused on fruits,
vegetables, whole grains, lean meats or meat alternates, and low-fat
dairy products. Participants received 1 point for each recommended
food consumed at least weekly. Based on the length of our FFQ, the
maximum possible scores were 49‚Äì56, depending on the version of the
FFQ.

The DQIR score was based on methods developed by Haines et al.
(13). and adapted for our FFQ by Newby et al. (14). BrieÔ¨Çy, the DQIR
consists of 10 components that measure intake of several food groups
and nutrients as well as diet diversity and moderation. These com-
ponents included grains, vegetables, fruit, total fat, saturated fat,
cholesterol, iron, calcium, diet diversity, and moderation in added fat
and sugar. The range of possible scores for each component was 0‚Äì10
points, depending on the level of intake; the maximum possible DQIR
score was 100 points.

The aMed score was based on a Mediterranean diet scale by
Trichopoulou et al. (15,16). The original score was based on the intake
of 9 items: vegetables, legumes, fruits and nuts, dairy, cereals, meat and
meat products, Ô¨Åsh, alcohol, and the monounsaturated:saturated fat
ratio. Participants with intake above the median intake received 1

point; otherwise they received 0 points. Meat and dairy product
consumption below the median received 1 point. We modiÔ¨Åed the
original scale by excluding potato products from the vegetable group,
separating fruits and nuts into 2 groups, eliminating the dairy group,
including whole-grain products only, including only red and processed
meats for the meat group, and assigning 1 point for alcohol intake
between 5 and 15 g/d. These modiÔ¨Åcations were based on dietary
patterns and eating behaviors that have been consistently associated
with lower risks of chronic disease in clinical and epidemiological
studies. The score range for the aMed was 0‚Äì9.

Case ascertainment. For this analysis, we used incident breast
cancers obtained by self-report in the biennial questionnaire post-1984
to 2002. Permission was then obtained to review medical records for
conÔ¨Årmation for all self-reported cases; 99% of self-reported cases were
conÔ¨Årmed by medical records. We also included 1% of cases conÔ¨Årmed
by the participants. Estrogen and progesterone receptor status was
obtained from pathology reports and each receptor was classiÔ¨Åed as
positive, negative, or uncertain. Deaths were reported by the postal
service, family members, or by searching the National Death Index. In
this study, we included only postmenopausal breast cancer cases to
reduce potential etiologic heterogeneity.

Statistical analysis. To reduce random within-person variation
and best represent long-term dietary intake, we calculated cumulative
averages of diet quality scores from each of the FFQ. For example,
scores in 1984 were used to predict breast cancer occurrence from
1984 to 1986, and the average of 1984 and 1986 intake was used to
model cancer risk in 1986‚Äì1988, and so on (17). We also used baseline
(1984) diet as a predictor of breast cancer risk to assess the inÔ¨Çuence of
long-term diet.

We used the Cox proportional hazards model to assess associations
between dietary quality scores and the risk of breast cancer between
1984 and 2002. The regression analyses were adjusted for age, smoking
status (never, past, current smoker up to 14 cigarettes/d, 15‚Äì24
cigarettes/d, 251 cigarettes/d), BMI (5 categories), multivitamin (yes/
no), energy intake (quintiles), physical activity in metabolic equivalent
(MET) h/wk (quintiles), family history of breast cancer (yes/no),
personal history of benign breast disease (yes/no), age at menopause,
and use of postmenopausal hormone therapy (13 categories), BMI at
age 18 (4 categories), and weight change since age 18 y (7 categories).
Alcohol intake (4 categories) was adjusted in the analysis of HEI,
DQIR, and RFS, but not in the AHEI or aMed scores because alcohol
is one of the components of these indices. We also classiÔ¨Åed breast
cancer by the ER status of the tumors. In stratiÔ¨Åed analysis, we cen-
sored women when they were diagnosed with breast cancer with ER
status that was not the outcome of the particular analysis. For example,
in analysis of ER1 tumors, we censored women when they were
diagnosed with ER2 tumors. We did not present data on progesterone
receptor status because it did not affect the diet-breast cancer relation.

RESULTS

During 18 y of follow-up, we ascertained 3580 cases of breast
cancer in postmenopausal women. Of these, 2367 were ER1
and 575 were ER√ø; the remainder (638 cases) could not be
clearly classiÔ¨Åed. In this cohort, women who scored high on
these indices were less likely to be smokers, had a higher level of
physical activity, and were more likely to use postmenopausal
hormones (Table 1).

When we considered all postmenopausal breast cancer
cases, we did not Ô¨Ånd any association with any of the diet
quality indices (Table 2). However, when we analyzed ER1
and ER√ø cases separately, we found an inverse association
between AHEI, RFS, and aMed and ER√ø cases (Table 3).
After adjusting for potential confounders, the relative risks
(RR) comparing top and bottom quintiles of these scores were
0.78 (95% CI ¬º 0.59‚Äì1.04, P for trend ¬º 0.01) for AHEI, 0.69
(95% CI ¬º 0.51‚Äì0.94, P for trend ¬º 0.003) for RFS, 0.79 (95%
CI ¬º 0.60‚Äì1.03, P for trend ¬º 0.03) for aMed. Of these 3
indices, RFS had the strongest association with ER√ø tumors.

When AHEI, RFS, and aMed were included in the same
regression model, the relative risks (RR) comparing top and
bottom quintiles of these scores were 0.83 (95% CI ¬º 0.54‚Äì
1.26, P for trend ¬º 0.31) for AHEI, 0.78 (95% CI ¬º 0.53‚Äì1.14,
P for trend ¬º 0.06) for RFS, and 1.04 (95% CI ¬º 0.67‚Äì1.66, P
for trend ¬º 0.71) for aMed. There was no association with ER1
cases for these scores. The HEI and DQI-R were not associated
with ER status. The RR of ER1 and ER√ø tumors did not differ
for any of the diet quality scores. We conducted an additional
analysis using baseline (1984 diet) and found essentially the
same results. In an alternate approach to compare the indices,
we assessed the risk for ER√ø breast cancer for a 10% increase in
each of the scores. There was no association with HEI (RR ¬º
0.96, P ¬º 0.36) or DQIR (RR ¬º 0.95, P ¬º 0.23). However, for

each 10% increase in AHEI, there was an 11% reduction of risk
(P ¬º 0.01), for RFS a 12% reduction (P ¬º 0.002), and for aMed
a 7% reduction (P ¬º 0.02) (not shown). Because AHEI and
aMed awarded points for alcohol intake of 1‚Äì2 drinks/d, we
additionally adjusted for alcohol intake in secondary analysis
and obtained essentially the same results.
When we examined the association between the compo-
nents of AHEI and aMed and their association with ER√ø breast
cancer, we found that a high score on the vegetable component
in AHEI (RR comparing top to bottom quintile ¬º 0.68, 95%
CI ¬º 0.51, 0.91, P for trend ¬º 0.01) was associated with a lower
risk. An inverse association was also observed with comparably
higher intakes of unsaturated fats than saturated fats for the
AHEI. The RR comparing top to bottom quintile of the

2 Adjusted for age, BMI, physical activity, age at menopause and postmenopausal hormone therapy use, smoking, energy intake, family history,
weight change since age 18 y, multivitamin use (except for AHEI because it is a component), history of benign breast disease, weight at age 18 y, alcohol
(except for AHEI, DQI-R, and aMed because alcohol was part of the scoring criteria).

polyunsaturated:saturated fat intake ratio was 0.75 (95% CI ¬º
0.58, 0.98, P for trend ¬º 0.02) (Table 4). Similarly, for the
aMed index, the RR comparing top to bottom quintile of the
monounsaturated:saturated fat intake ratio was 0.79 (95% CI
¬º 0.63, 0.99, P for trend ¬º 0.04). There was also a suggestion of
inverse association with higher score (thus higher intake) of
fruits for the AHEI. Alcohol intake, in the range of 1‚Äì2 drinks/
d (intake of this range was awarded a higher score in AHEI and
aMed) did not appear to inÔ¨Çuence the risk of ER√ø breast cancer.
Because vegetables are major contributors to the RFS, we
further analyzed subtypes of vegetables and risk of ER√ø tumors.
We observed an inverse association with yellow/orange
vegetables, with an RR of 0.76 comparing 11/d intake vs.
,2/wk (95% CI ¬º 0.57, 0.99, P for trend ¬º 0.04) (Table 5).
Similarly, RR for ‚Äò‚Äòother‚Äô‚Äô vegetables (vegetables that do not Ô¨Åt
into the categories speciÔ¨Åed, such as eggplant, green peppers,
and celery) was 0.67 (95% CI ¬º 0.53, 0.87, P for trend ¬º 0.03).
Although there was no signiÔ¨Åcant inverse trend with leafy
vegetable intake, the RR was 0.72 (95% CI ¬º 0.54, 0.96) for

consumption frequency of 5‚Äì6/wk and 0.71 (95% CI ¬º 0.55,
0.90) for 11/d, compared with ,2 times/wk consumption.
Because intakes of different types of vegetables are correlated,
we attempted to tease out the independent association of these
vegetable types with ER√ø breast cancer by including all
vegetables types in the regression model. In general, the inverse
associations were somewhat attenuated and P-values for trend
were no longer signiÔ¨Åcant. However, daily intake of at least 1
serving of ‚Äò‚Äòother‚Äô‚Äô vegetables, compared with ,2 times/wk,
remained inversely associated with ER√ø tumors (RR ¬º 0.73,
95% CI ¬º 0.54, 0.99).

DISCUSSION

In this study, only the AHEI, RFS and aMed scores were
inversely associated with ER√ø breast cancer. There was no
association between the risk of ER1 breast cancer and any of
the diet quality scores after multivariate adjustment.

2 10 points are awarded for intake within the range of 0.5‚Äì1.5 drinks/d. Fewer points are awarded for intake above or below this range.

Although numerous studies have examined the association
between foods and nutrients and breast cancer risk, very few
have focused on the entire diet, and none to our knowledge
have used established diet quality indices as predictors of risk.
In addition, subtypes of breast cancer have generally not been
analyzed separately. Risk factors for breast cancer may differ
according to the ER status of the tumor (5,18). Estrogen
exposure is one of the strongest risk factors for breast cancer,
but it may have less inÔ¨Çuence on ER√ø tumors than ER1
tumors. This is supported by results of chemoprevention trials
on ER modulators in which the reduction of incidence was
observed for ER1 tumors only (19,20). Therefore, in ER1
tumors, any potential inÔ¨Çuence of dietary factors may be dif-
Ô¨Åcult to detect given the strong inÔ¨Çuence of hormonal factors.
Conversely, in ER√ø tumors, other risk factors, including diet,

may exert a relatively larger inÔ¨Çuence and be more easily
detectable.
The HEI, AHEI, and RFS did not predict combined cancer
risk from all sites in our cohort (2). However, ER√ø breast
cancer was only a small portion of all cancers diagnosed in our
cohort; therefore, the lack of association with overall cancer
risk is not inconsistent with our Ô¨Åndings. In a cohort of Swedish
women, those whose RFS score was in the highest quintile had
a 24% lower risk (P for trend ¬º 0.005) of overall cancer
mortality than those with scores in the bottom quintile (3). On
the other hand, the Mediterranean Diet Score (on which ours
was based), was inversely associated with overall cancer
mortality (15). Empirically derived dietary patterns using factor
analysis identiÔ¨Åed a ‚Äò‚Äòprudent‚Äô‚Äô pattern that has characteristics
similar to the AHEI and aMed (21,22). This pattern was not

associated with overall breast cancer risk in one study (22);
however, when ER types were analyzed separately, an inverse
association was observed with ER√ø cancer (23).

The ability of diet quality scores to predict breast cancer risk
depends on how well these scores measure dietary risk factors
for breast cancer. The most consistent dietary risk factor for
breast cancer is alcohol (4), and folate is a possible modiÔ¨Åer in
this relation (24). Fruits and vegetables, the major sources of
folate were inversely associated with overall breast cancer in
a case-control study (25), but this association was mainly null in
cohort studies (26,27). However, such studies generally did not
distinguish between ER subtypes. When tumors of different ER
status were analyzed separately, an inverse association was
observed with ER√ø tumors in one cohort (28). In a recent
study from our group, each serving of vegetables intake was
associated with a 6% reduction in ER√ø breast cancer and each
serving of fruit was associated with a 12% reduction, whereas
no association was observed for ER1 tumors (23). In addition,
a dietary pattern consisting of fruits, vegetables, whole grains,
Ô¨Åsh, and poultry was also associated with a lower risk of ER√ø
tumors compared with diets low in those foods. Fat intake after
menopause has little association with breast cancer risk (29), but
premenopausal fat intake from red meats and dairy products may
be associated with breast cancer in premenopausal women (30).
All diet quality scores include fruits and vegetables, but they
contribute only 10‚Äì20% of the total score except for the RFS to
which they contribute ;80% of the total score. In addition, the
AHEI also awards points for multivitamin intake, which usually
contains a substantial amount of folic acid.
The RFS, which had the strongest inverse relation with
ER√ø tumors, does not include alcohol. The AHEI and aMed
consider moderate alcohol intake to be a beneÔ¨Åcial component

of the diet given its association with lower cardiovascular
disease risk (31); thus, it may not be optimal to use it as a re-
commendation for breast cancer prevention. Because both the
AHEI and aMed indices are inversely associated with ER√ø breast
cancer, moderate alcohol intake may not overwhelm the ben-
eÔ¨Åcial inÔ¨Çuence of other dietary components.

Because cancer development is usually slow, the long follow-
up period in this study and the availability of dietary infor-
mation over multiple years increase the possibility that we can
capture important periods during which diet may exert an
inÔ¨Çuence on breast cancer risk in adults. Our analysis was
adjusted extensively for potential confounders. Although we
did not observe an association with ER1 tumors, this does not
exclude the possibility that diet earlier in life may have an in-
Ô¨Çuence on the development of ER1 tumors.

As illustrated in Table 2, the distribution of cases in each the
quintile of the various scores varied; this is expected given the
different criteria for what constitutes a healthy diet in these
scores. Thus, we are comparing different constructs, and popu-
lations will score higher or lower on various indices, depending
on the components of the score and the underlying consump-
tion of those dietary components in a population. We thought
it was most objective to compare associations based on dis-
tribution within each score (e.g., quintiles).
In conclusion, our Ô¨Åndings suggest that ER√ø breast cancer
tumors may be more strongly associated with diet than ER1
tumors. We found that high scores for the AHEI, RFS, and
aMed were associated with a lower risk of ER√ø breast cancer,
whereas the HEI and DQI-R were of limited value in predicting
breast cancer risk. The dietary patterns reÔ¨Çected by these scores
may serve as possible guidelines for cancer prevention, espe-
cially for ER√ø breast cancer in postmenopausal women.
