ABSTRACT Although fruits and vegetables have been implicated in the etiology of pancreatic cancer, the role of
phytochemicals in these food groups has received little attention to date. In this study, we investigated the possible
association between dietary carotenoids and pancreatic cancer risk. A case-control study of 462 histologically
conﬁrmed pancreatic cancer cases and 4721 population-based controls in 8 Canadian provinces took place
between 1994 and 1997. Dietary intake was assessed by a self-administered FFQ. Unconditional logistic regres-
sion was used to assess associations between speciﬁc and total carotenoid intakes and the risk of pancreatic
cancer. All tests of statistical signiﬁcance were 2-sided. After adjustment for age, province, BMI, smoking,
educational attainment, dietary folate, and total energy intake, lycopene, provided mainly by tomatoes, was
associated with a 31% reduction in pancreatic cancer risk among men [odds ratio (OR) ⫽ 0.69; 95% CI: 0.46 – 0.96;
P ⫽ 0.026 for trend] when comparing the highest and lowest quartiles of intake. Both ␤-carotene (OR ⫽ 0.57; 95%
CI: 0.32– 0.99; P ⫽ 0.016 for trend) and total carotenoids (OR ⫽ 0.58; 95% CI: 0.34 –1.00; P ⫽ 0.02 for trend) were
associated with a signiﬁcantly reduced risk among those who never smoked. The results of this study suggest that
a diet rich in tomatoes and tomato-based products with high lycopene content may help reduce pancreatic cancer
risk.

Pancreatic cancer is the 4th leading cause of cancer-related
deaths in both men and women in Canada (1). Survival is
extremely low worldwide, with a 5-y survival rate of ⬍5% (2),
and a case fatality proportion of 99% within 12 mo of diagnosis
(3). Several epidemiologic studies suggested that high con-
sumption of fruits and vegetables, which are major sources of
carotenoids, may play a role in the prevention of pancreatic
cancer. Substantial evidence from experimental investigations
showed that carotenoids precipitate cancer-preventing events,
including antioxidant activity, enhancement of immune func-
tion, stimulation of gap junctional intercellular communica-
tion, induction of detoxifying enzymes, and inhibition of cel-
lular proliferation (4,5). It was suggested that ␣-carotene

suppresses cytochrome P450 1A1, an activator of procarcino-
gens (6). ␤-Carotene may control growth-inhibitory and pro-
apoptotic effects in cancer cells through the redox regulation
of the nuclear transcription factor NF-␬B activity (7). Lyco-
pene is the most efﬁcient singlet oxygen quencher in vitro (8);
lutein and zeaxanthin are scavengers of radical oxygen species
(4), whereas ␤-cryptoxanthin may stimulate the expression of
RB, an anti-oncogene and p73, a p53-related gene (9).

Despite the mechanistic hypotheses suggesting that intake
of carotenoids may be related to reduced pancreatic cancer
risk, no epidemiologic studies have addressed this issue to date.
The present case-control study was undertaken to investigate
the possible association between the intake of speciﬁc and
total carotenoids and pancreatic cancer risk within the Cana-
dian National Enhanced Cancer Surveillance System
(NECSS).3 This study also examined the modifying effect of
smoking on the association between dietary carotenoid intake
and pancreatic cancer risk because free radicals in cigarette
smoke can alter the concentrations of most carotenoids (10).

DIETARY CAROTENOIDS AND PANCREATIC CANCER RISK

SUBJECTS AND METHODS

Study population. The NECSS is a multisite, population-based,
case-control study involving 21,020 participants with 1 of 19 types of
cancer identiﬁed through cancer registries in 8 of the 10 Canadian
provinces, namely, Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, Newfound-
land, Nova Scotia, Ontario, Prince Edward Island, and Saskatche-
wan. The present investigation includes only pancreatic cancer cases,
and is restricted to data obtained from direct interviews. The study
population was described in detail elsewhere (11). Brieﬂy, between
April 1, 1994 and December 31, 1997, participating provincial reg-
istries identiﬁed pancreatic cancer cases as early as possible in the
registration process to minimize the loss of subjects because pancre-
atic cancer is a rapidly fatal disease. All pancreatic cancer cases
included in the NECSS were conﬁrmed histologically, and deﬁned
according to the WHO’s International Classiﬁcation of Diseases,
rubric 157 (12).

Like most other studies of pancreatic cancer that collected infor-
mation directly from case subjects, the overall proportion of eligible
cases that responded was low. Among men diagnosed with pancreatic
cancer, 30% had died before an interview could be conducted, and
consent was not granted by physicians for an additional 15%. For
women, 28% had died before they could be contacted, and the
attending physician refused consent to approach patients for an
additional 16%. The vast majority of cases were ascertained within
1–3 mo of diagnosis; physician consent to send questionnaires to
patients was generally obtained within 1 mo, and ⬃70% of question-
naires were returned within 2 mo of mailing. Response rates of
eligible cases were 55% for men and 56% for women.

The NECSS used frequency matching in selecting the control
population to achieve age and gender distributions similar to those of
all cancer cases combined. Based on the projected number of incident
cancer cases by province, the questionnaires were mailed to 8117
subjects during the 1996 calendar year using the same protocol as for
cases. Questionnaires were not returned for 573 controls (7.4%)
because of incorrect or changed addresses. Strategies for control
selection varied by province, depending on data accessibility. In
Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and
British Columbia, provincial health insurance plans were tapped to
obtain a random sample of the provincial population stratiﬁed by age
and gender. In each of these provinces, ⬎95% of residents are
covered by public health care plans. Active military personnel and
their families as well as indigenous peoples were excluded because
they were covered by other plans. In Ontario, Ministry of Finance
data were used to derive a stratiﬁed random sample, whereas New-
foundland and Alberta adopted a random digit-dialing method to
enroll a population-based sample of controls. A total of 5039 controls
were selected to serve as a common control group for all types of
cancer. Response rates of 65 and 71% were achieved from the male
and female control populations, respectively.

Questionnaires, with telephone follow-up for clariﬁcation when
necessary, were mailed to study subjects to obtain information on
residential and occupational histories and other risk factors for can-
cer. The NECSS questionnaire included questions on smoking his-
tory, height, weight, physical activity, and education attainment.
This research was approved by the ethics committee of Health
Canada and written, informed consent was obtained from each study
subject.

Dietary assessment. Food consumption data were obtained via a
semiquantitative FFQ derived from 2 instruments developed in the
United States that have been widely validated previously, i.e., the
short Block questionnaire (13) and the Willett questionnaire (14).
Subtle changes were made to the questionnaire items to take into
account differences in American and Canadian dietary practices. The
FFQ includes questions on 69 different food and beverage items,
including the frequency of consumption and the amounts consumed.
Participants were asked how often they had consumed these foods per
week in the time period 2 y before interview.

Food and beverage items were retrieved from the FFQ and used to
estimate the daily intake of individual carotenoids, based on the
USDA-Nutrition Coordinating Center (NCC) Carotenoid Database
(15). This online database provides food composition values for 6
speciﬁc carotenoids contained in food and beverage items included in

the study questionnaire. Information on other nutrients, including
total carotenoids, dietary folate, and total energy, was obtained
through the 1997 Canadian Nutrient File.

Data were collected for 475 cases (264 men, 211 women) and
5039 controls (2547 men, 2492 women). We excluded controls
⬍ 30 y of age (n ⫽ 237) because pancreatic cancer cases are usually
ⱖ30 y old. Furthermore, subjects with daily energy intake ⬍ 500 kcal
(2.092 MJ) (10 cases and 54 controls) or ⬎ 5000 kcal (20.92 MJ) (3
cases and 27 controls) were excluded because such intakes are unre-
alistic and hence of questionable validity. Finally, a total of 462 cases
(258 men, 204 women) and 4721 frequency-matched controls (2331
men, 2390 women) were eligible for analysis.

Statistical analysis. Food intake among cases and controls was
analyzed according to carotenoid intake based on the USDA-NCC
Carotenoid Database and the Canadian Nutrient File noted previ-
ously. Mean intakes were calculated separately for cases and controls.
To compare the study population characteristics, we used the ␹2 test
or Mantel extension test for categorical variables and the paired t test
for continuous variables. To evaluate associations between carot-
enoids and pancreatic cancer risk, the study subjects were divided
into 4 categories on the basis of quartiles of total and each speciﬁc
energy-adjusted carotenoid intake in the control population. Odds
ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs were calculated using unconditional logis-
tic regression. Analyses were adjusted for matching variables (age
group and province), lifetime cigarette consumption (0, ⬎0 –15, and
⬎15 pack-y), BMI (⬍25, 25–29.9, and ⱖ30 kg/m2), educational
attainment (y), dietary folate, and total energy intake.

To evaluate the combined effect of intake of individual carot-
enoids and selected lifestyle variables (smoking, BMI, age, and edu-
cational attainment), the P-value for a multiplicative interaction
term added to a fully adjusted model was examined; when it was
signiﬁcant, the analysis was stratiﬁed on that variable. Tests for linear
trend in the carotenoid variables included in logistic regression were
performed by replacing the indicator variables in each multivariate
model with a single variable representing the median frequency of
consumption for a given intake category, and by using the Wald ␹2
value computed for the regression coefﬁcient of this variable to test
the null hypothesis of no linear trend in pancreatic cancer risk across
quartiles of intake. This analysis focused on carotenoid intake from
diet, rather from speciﬁc carotenoid supplements. At the time the
study was conducted, questions about the consumption of such sup-
plements were not included in the FFQ. Models were ﬁt for men and
women separately. All tests of statistical signiﬁcance were 2-sided and
P-values ⬍ 0.05 were considered signiﬁcant. All analyses were con-
ducted using SPSS statistical software (release 10.02, SPSS).

RESULTS

Selected characteristics of the study population are pre-
sented (Table 1). In both men and women, there were appre-
ciable differences between cases and controls for age distribu-
tions with an excess of younger control subjects (P ⬍ 0.05); in
addition, cases were more likely to use high amounts of to-
bacco (P ⬍ 0.01). Two years before the diagnosis of cancer,
there was a higher pancreatic cancer risk with increased BMI
in both genders (P ⬍ 0.05). Among men, cases were more
likely to have greater total energy intake than controls (P
⬍ 0.01).

The main food sources of ␣-carotene in the diet were
carrots and tomatoes. ␤-Carotene was derived primarily from
potatoes, carrots, and spinach. ␤-Cryptoxanthin was supplied
by oranges and fruit juices, whereas lycopene was mainly from
tomatoes, tomato juice, and tomato sauce. Lutein ⫹ zeaxan-
thin were from broccoli and green-leaf vegetables, and total
carotenoids were mainly from potatoes, carrots, and canta-
loupes.

The ORs and corresponding 95% CIs for pancreatic cancer
according to speciﬁc and total carotenoid intakes are summa-
rized (Table 2). After adjustment for age, province, educa-
tional attainment, smoking, BMI, folate, and total energy

with the lowest quartile of intakes. These results did not differ
among subgroups deﬁned by pack-years of cigarette smoking.
Overall, there was no signiﬁcant effect modiﬁcation by BMI,
age, physical activity, and educational attainment (data not
shown).

DISCUSSION

This population-based case-control study demonstrated an
inverse dose-response relation between lycopene and pancre-
atic cancer in men. Intakes of ␤-carotene and total carot-
enoids were signiﬁcantly associated with reduced pancreatic
cancer risk among those who never smoked. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the ﬁrst epidemiologic study to examine the
role of speciﬁc dietary carotenoids in risk assessment of pan-
creatic cancer.

Previous observational investigations assessed the relation
between lycopene serum concentrations and pancreatic cancer
with consistent results. A case-control study found that plasma
lycopene levels were signiﬁcantly lower in pancreatic cancer
cases than in matched controls (16). In the Washington
County Cohort Study, in which subjects were followed for
almost 15 y, signiﬁcantly lower baseline serum lycopene levels
were documented in subjects with pancreatic cancer than in
matched cohort controls (17,18). Lower serum lycopene levels
were observed in individuals with certain chronic diseases,
including cancer, suggesting that lycopene intake reduces the
occurrence, extent, or degree of these conditions, or that
lycopene is depleted by oxidative stress and inﬂammatory
processes (19). Interestingly, in vitro studies suggest that ly-
copene inhibits gap junction communication (20), activates
phase II enzymes (21), suppresses eicosanoid metabolism by
blocking cyclooxygenase-2 synthesis (22), and inhibits tumor
cell growth by repressing insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor
activation (23). However, these putative mechanisms remain
speculative and require conﬁrmation.

We observed a 42% reduction in pancreatic risk in relation
to both ␤-carotene and total carotenoids among those who
never smoked, but no clear evidence of an association between
any individual or total carotenoid intakes and pancreatic can-
cer risk among past or current smokers. Exposure to tobacco
smoke causes extensive ␤-carotene oxidation (24). It was
reported that cigarette smoking is independently associated
with lowered circulating concentrations of provitamin A carot-
enoids: in general, active smokers have ⬎25% lower circulat-
ing concentrations of ␣-carotene, ␤-carotene, and ␤-crypto-
xanthin than nonsmokers, even after adjusting for dietary

intake and other demographic factors (10,25). Moreover, de-
pressed plasma ␤-carotene concentrations were reported in
response to enhanced metabolic turnover resulting from smok-
ing-induced oxidative stress (26). If this putative oxidative
mechanism can be shown to affect the relation between ␤-car-
otene and smoking, it would help explain why ␤-carotene and
total carotenoids, which come from similar sources, were as-
sociated with a reduced pancreatic cancer risk in this study
only among those who never smoked.

The major strengths of our study include its uniqueness, the
large number of pancreatic cancer cases, histological diagnosis

of pancreatic cancer cases, and general population sampling.
Ours is the ﬁrst study to examine the role of dietary carotenoid
intakes in risk assessment of pancreatic cancer. The large
sample size permitted subgroup analyses by sex and smoking
status. Histological conﬁrmation of diagnosis reduced the pos-
sibility of disease misclassiﬁcation, whereas the population-
based approach to subject selection facilitated extrapolation of
our results to the general population.

Our study is also subject to certain limitations. Because the
assessment of dietary exposure was retrospective, recall bias
cannot be completely excluded. A prospective cohort ap-

proach has several advantages when studying associations be-
tween nutritional factors and cancer risk. However, because of
the relatively low incidence of pancreatic cancer, the largest
cohort to date examining diet and pancreatic cancer risk
included only 178 pancreatic cancer cases throughout 18 y of
follow-up (27). We could not adjust OR estimates for the
potentially confounding effect of diabetes mellitus and family
history of pancreatic cancer because this information was not
collected at baseline. Nevertheless, we expect that diabetes did
not confound the association between dietary carotenoids and
pancreatic cancer risk because diet is likely to be an initial risk
factor for both chronic diseases, rather than lying on their
causal pathways. In addition, it was suggested that the impor-
tance of diabetes is much reduced if pancreatic cancer cases of
recent onset are excluded (28). In addition, it is unlikely that
the confounding effect of family aggregation of pancreatic
cancer may explain the associations we found because genetic/
familial predisposition is relatively rare (29). Moreover,
conﬁrmation of a hereditary component is particularly chal-
lenging because pancreatic cancer may occur only infre-
quently in some of the hereditary cancer syndromes, in
accordance with reduced frequency of the deleterious, pre-
disposing mutations (30).

Although the USDA-NCC Carotenoid Database used in
the present analysis represents the most current and compre-
hensive data available to date, data were not available for all
of the Canadian food items we investigated. In addition, the
carotenoid content of foods is highly variable depending on a
number of factors, including geographical area and growing
conditions, cultivar or variety, processing techniques, method
of food preparation, and length and conditions of storage (4).
As a consequence, the likelihood of nondifferential misclassi-
ﬁcation cannot be completely excluded, raising the possibility
that some associations were obscured.

Another limitation is the consequence of early and high
case fatality associated with the disease. As in other epidemi-
ologic studies of pancreatic cancer, cases who died before the
questionnaire could be administered were not included in the
analysis. Bias may have been introduced in the present inves-
tigation if rapidly fatal cases had a different etiology from cases
with longer survival, or if the dietary carotenoids under study
inﬂuenced survival. However, because there was no discrimi-
nation in the selection of study subjects based on their demo-
graphic characteristics and lifestyle factors, such as age, dietary

patterns, smoking, or educational attainment, survivors are
still representative of the study population. Consequently,
selection bias is unlikely to be substantial.

In conclusion, we found a signiﬁcantly reduced pancreatic
cancer risk with dietary intake of lycopene among men. A
signiﬁcant inverse association was also observed between pan-
creatic cancer risk and both dietary ␤-carotene and total
carotenoid intakes among those who never smoked. As a
whole, our data supported the association of a diet rich in
vegetables with a reduction in risk of pancreatic cancer. More
studies assessing associations between dietary carotenoids and
the risk of pancreatic cancer are warranted to better elucidate
the role of diet in the etiology of pancreatic cancer.
