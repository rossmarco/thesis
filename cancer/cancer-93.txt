 Animal Fat Consumption and Prostate Cancer: A

 Prospective Study in Hawaii

 Whereas case-control studies have been very consistent in
 suggesting a positive association between intake of dietary
 fat, especially animal fat, and prostate cancer, the results from
 past cohort studies have been mostly inconclusive. In this
 study, we evaluated consumption of high-fat animal products,
 raw vegetables, and fresh fruits, as well as obesity, smoking,
 and drinking, in relation to subsequent occurrence of pros?
 tate cancer. We studied a cohort of 20,316 men of various
 ethnicities interviewed between 1975 and 1980 in Hawaii.
 As of December 1989, 198 incident cases with invasive
 prostate cancer were identified by computer-assisted linkage
 of this cohort to the statewide Surveillance, Epidemiology,
 and End Results registry. Relative risks (RRs) for prostate
 cancer computed by proportional hazards regression were
 elevated for intake of beef [RR for highest to lowest tertile

 of intake = 1.6; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.1-2.4] and
 milk (RR = 1.4; 95% CI = 1.0-2.1), and for a summary
 variable for intake of high-fat animal products (RR = 1.6;
 95% CI = 1.0-2.4). Weight was not consistently associated
 with prostate cancer, but there was an association with height
 (>167 cm) (RR = 1.8; 95% CI = 1.0-3.2 for the third and
 fourth quartiles relative to the lowest quartile in height).
 These associations were stronger in men diagnosed before
 age 72.5 years. The risk estimates for raw vegetable and fresh
 fruit intakes were close to 1.0. Smoking and alcohol drinking
 appeared to be unrelated to risk. This study provides further
 evidence for a role of animal fat in the etiology of prostate
 cancer and indicates that it may act by shortening the latency
 period of the disease. (Epidemiology 1994;5:276-282)

 Keywords: diet, dietary fat, height, obesity, prostate cancer, tobacco smoking.

 Diets rich in animal fat appear to be associated with
 increased risk for prostate cancer. Ecologic studies have
 shown a strong positive correlation between dietary fat
 intake and prostate cancer rates within and among
 countries.1-3 Rates for this cancer are lower in white
 Seventh-Day Adventists, who are often vegetarians,
 than other white men in California,4 whereas prostate
 cancer rates have greatly increased in populations that
 have increased their fat consumption, such as Japanese
 and Polish migrants to the U.S. or Japanese in Japan
 in recent decades.5,6 Case-control studies have been

 remarkably consistent in showing that patients with
 prostatic cancer report a greater intake of dietary fat,
 especially saturated fat, than controls.7 In contrast, the
 cohort studies reported to date have not shown the
 same consistency in findings.7 Reasons for this discrep-
 ancy are unclear but include at least three possibilities:
 (1) recall bias in case-control studies; (2) dietary assess?
 ment too remote from the time of diagnosis in cohort
 studies, assuming that animal fat is a late promoter and
 that older men commonly undergo dietary change7;
 and (3) random fluctuations in the results of the few
 cohort studies reported to date.

 We report here the findings on prostate cancer from

 a large, population-based prospective cohort study of
 diet and cancer being conducted among the multieth-
 nic population of Hawaii. The marked differences in
 diet (particularly fat intake) and cancer incidence ob?
 served among the various ethnic groups living in Ha?
 waii make them an ideal population for such research.

 items (for example, name and birthyear). The accept?
 ance of a match is then based on the cumulative
 probability of a chance match across the linkage items.
 This method has proved itself useful and accurate in
 previous research.11

 The present analysis is limited to subjects from the
 five main ethnic groups in Hawaii 0apanese, Caucasian,
 Filipino, Hawaiian/Part-Hawaiian, and Chinese) and is
 based on histologically confirmed cancer cases (that is,
 based on tissue collected by biopsy, surgical removal,
 or needle aspiration) identified in the Hawaii Tumor
 Registry through December 1989. We excluded sub?
 jects (N = 375) with any invasive cancer within 5 years
 before entry, as the interview may have reflected recent
 changes in life-style habits resulting from being ill. In
 addition, we also excluded subjects (N = 12) with a
 diagnosis of prostate cancer earlier than 5 years before
 interview from this analysis.

 Linkage of the cohort to the Hawaii Tumor Registry
 identified 198 eligible cases with invasive prostate car?
 cinoma. None of these men was less than 45 years old
 at interview, whereas 44% of the cohort was younger
 than 45 years at baseline. Thus, to optimize the adjust?
 ment for age, we excluded all subjects younger than
 age 45 at entry. In Table 1 is shown the ethnic distri?
 bution of the cohort members used in the analysis.

 Our previous research in Hawaii has demonstrated
 that usual portion sizes of food items can differ among
 ethnic groups and, consequently, are important in
 determining dietary intake in our population.12 Thus,
 we developed ethnic-sex-age-specific standard portion
 sizes to improve food intake quantitation. We com?
 puted portion sizes for four age groups (<45, 45-54,
 55-64, >64 years) within each ethnic-sex group, using
 control data from population-based case-control stud?
 ies recently conducted by our group that assessed total
 dietary intakes. Briefly, we identified in the detailed
 dietary histories all of the component food items (for
 example, specific cuts of beef, specific uncooked vege?
 tables) that contributed to a particular food or food
 group listed on the cohort questionnaire (for example,

 throughout Hawaii to collect demographic and health-
 related data.8 Because this survey is mandated by law,
 the participation rate has been very high (95%). Most
 interviews are conducted in person, although in some
 instances, the information is collected by telephone.
 From 1975 to 1980, we were permitted to add to this
 survey a 2-page life-style questionnaire that was admin?
 istered to all participants age 18 years or older. The
 supplemental questionnaire included questions on
 height, weight, smoking, alcohol use, and diet. The
 regular questionnaire provided information on demo?
 graphic and socioeconomic variables.

 A total of 50,655 interviews were completed. Of
 these, 4,553 military personnel, whose residence in
 Hawaii is temporary, were eliminated from the cohort
 because ofthe passive method of follow-up (see below).
 In addition, 2,881 interviews were excluded because of
 missing or unreliable information on surname or age,
 and 1,821 because they were duplicates. Thus, the final
 study population comprised 41,400 individuals, 20,316
 of whom were men.

 The dietary information was limited to the weekly
 frequency of intake of 13 food items (pork, poultry,
 beef, processed meats, fish, dried/salted fish, eggs, rice,
 taro, miso soup, pickled vegetables, raw vegetables, and
 fresh fruits), as well as the daily amounts consumed for
 six beverages (coffee, black tea, green tea, milk, regular
 soda, and diet soda). The smoking data included smok?
 ing status, age started, interval since quitting, and
 amounts smoked for cigarettes, cigars, and pipes sepa?
 rately. The questions on alcohol use included current
 drinking status, age drinking began, and, for each type
 of alcoholic beverage consumed (beer, wine, sake, hard
 liquor), the usual frequency and amount.

 Because out-migration from Hawaii is limited, we
 ascertained follow-up passively by linkage ofthe cohort
 to the Hawaii Tumor Registry, a member of the Sur?
 veillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) pro?
 gram ofthe National Cancer Institute.9 To justify using
 this approach, we actively traced a random sample of
 2,018 cohort members to document out-migration
 rates. As of January 1992, only 1% ofthe sample could
 not be traced. Most of the out-migration occurred
 within 10 years of entry and stabilized at 10.7% after
 the first 13 years.

 To update and verify names and other identifying
 information, the cohort was linked to the stated mar-
 riage and divorce files, death files, and voter's registra?
 tion files before linkage to the Hawaii Tumor Registry.
 These linkages were accomplished using a probabilistic
 linkage procedure developed by Mi et al.10 The method
 derives the probability of a chance match for all linkage

 beef, raw vegetables). Then, within each ethnic-sex-age
 group, we determined the average portion size for
 consumers of each component food item. These por?
 tion sizes were then weighted by the proportion of
 subjects who consumed each item to yield an overall
 portion size for the food or food group.

 We used proportional hazards regression13 to com-
 pute relative risks (RR) and 95% confidence intervals
 (CI) adjusted for age, ethnicity, and income (all of
 which we found associated with the risk of prostate
 cancer in a preliminary analysis), based on division of
 the exposure variables into quartiles or tertiles. For
 the regression analyses, we defined person-years at risk
 as the period from interview to diagnosis for cases,
 from interview to death for noncases who had expired,
 and from interview to the end of 1989 for all others.
 The tests for trend were based on a trend variable that
 was assigned the median value of the quantiles.

 Results
 Table 2 presents relative risks and 95% confidence
 intervals by increasing tertiles or quartiles of selected
 variables, after adjustment for covariates. Men in the
 third and fourth quartile of height (that is, >167 cm)
 were at 80% greater risk of developing prostate cancer
 than shorter men. There was also a markedly elevated
 risk with increasing intake of milk, beef, and a sum-

 mary index for foods rich in animal fats. These asso?
 ciations were dose dependent. Individual analyses of
 eggs, pork, poultry, and processed meat did not dem-
 onstrate a clear association with risk, although the risk
 was elevated in the third quartile of processed meat
 consumption. There was little association between
 prostate cancer and obesity, smoking, alcohol drinking,
 coffee, fish, raw vegetables, fresh fruits, or other food/
 beverages on the questionnaire.

 Because exposure information was collected only
 once, some misclassification on exposure status could
 have occurred for those subjects who changed their
 dietary habits during the follow-up. Thus, we repeated
 the analysis successively with cases whose prostatic
 cancer was diagnosed during the first 6 years of follow-
 up and those whose diagnosis occurred after 6 years of
 follow-up (the median interval between entry and di?
 agnosis for cases). The relative risks for prostate cancer
 during the first 6 years of follow-up were for milk: 1.0,
 1.3, 1.4, P-value for trend = 0.17; for beef: 1.0, 1.2,
 1.8, P = 0.04; and for high-animal fat products: 1.0,
 1.3, 1.5, 1.5, P = 0.23. Similar associations were found
 for the second part of the follow-up: (RR for milk: 1.0,
 1.3, 1.4, P = 0.15; RR for beef: 1.0, 1.1, 1.5, P = 0.17;
 RR for high-fat animal products: 1.0, 1.3, 1.6, 1.7, P =
 0.13).

 We then examined the modifying effect of age at

 diagnosis by apportioning the person-years of follow-
 up to time up to age 72.5 years and after age 72.5 years
 (the median age at diagnosis for the cases) and running
 separate analyses for the two age groups. As shown in
 Table 3, the associations with height, milk, beef, and
 high-fat animal products were stronger when prostate
 cancer was diagnosed before age 72.5 years.

 Next, we further stratified the cases by stage at
 diagnosis (localized and regional/distant). A total of 126
 cases were diagnosed at a localized stage, 20 at a regional
 stage, and 47 at a distant stage. We excluded five cases
 because of unknown stage. For the noncases, all per?
 son-years for each age category were included in each
 stage-specific analysis. As shown in Table 4, the asso?
 ciations with milk, beef, and high-fat animal products
 were present for both stage categories. The effects,
 however, were stronger for men <72.5 years of age
 than for older men.

 Discussion
 A number of studies have focused on dietary fet intake
 and prostate cancer. Eight of the nine case-control
 studies published to date have found a positive associ?
 ation, most often with animal fat.14"22 Follow-up stud?
 ies, however, have not shown this consistency. In a
 report by Snowdon et al23 based on a 21-year follow-
 up of 6,763 white male Seventh-Day Adventists in
 California, prostate cancer mortality was positively
 associated with consumption of milk, cheese, eggs, and
 meat. Another cohort of Californian Seventh-Day Ad?
 ventists, based on a 6-year follow-up of 14,000 men,
 showed only a weak positive association with intake of
 high-fat animal products.24 In their cohort of 8,000
 Japanese men followed for 20 years in Hawaii, Severson
 et al25 reported no association with meat or milk and
 a weak positive association with the frequency of con?
 sumption of butter, margarine, and cheese, as a group,

 have found a negative association with several types of
 fruits and vegetables or with beta-carotene.1418,19,21'24
 Some other studies have found a positive association
 with vitamin A or certain fruits or vegetables,15"17,19,20
 but most studies have found no association.22,23,25,26,28,29
 The present findings are in agreement with those latter

 and of eggs. Based on a 24-hour diet recall also collected
 in this Japanese cohort, no association was reported
 with fat intake. In a fourth cohort study conducted
 among 17,633 white men followed for 20 years, no
 notable association was found between prostate cancer
 mortality and frequency of consumption of meats,
 dairy products, and eggs.26 The present findings
 strengthen the evidence for a positive association be?
 tween high-fat animal products and prostate cancer
 risk. They also corroborate the results obtained for
 our population in a previous case-control study.20

 The lack of much increased risk associated with

 animal fat intake after age 72.5 years in this study could
 have resulted from extensive misclassification on dis?
 ease status in older men, owing to a large number of
 latent prostatic tumors in the noncases in that age
 group. To test this possibility, we examined the effect
 of age on this association for advanced tumors, since
 they are likely to have diagnosable symptoms and, thus,
 to be less misclassified on disease status. The age effect
 was not limited to early-stage tumors but was also
 apparent for advanced cancers, supporting the possi?
 bility of an age specificity for the association with
 animal fat. Thus, animal fat may be a promoter and
 may act by shortening the latency period of prostatic
 cancer.

 Studies on obesity and prostate cancer have also
 produced conflicting results.30 In one case-control
 study,17 obese men were found to be at increased risk,
 but no association was reported in several other case-
 control studies, including one in Hawaii.15,18,20,21 In
 two cohort studies, relative weight or body mass index
 was found to be positively associated with risk,23,31
 whereas in two others,24,32 and in the present study,
 little association was observed. Some of this inconsist-
 ency may result from the fact that body mass index
 measures both adiposity and lean body mass. Severson
 et al33 have proposed that the positive association
 observed in some studies might be accounted for more
 by muscle mass than by fat tissue.

 In contrast with the present investigation, none of
 the nine past studies of prostate cancer that reported
 on height found an association with this variable.30
 The lack of a relation found between prostate cancer
 and exposure to a vegetarian life-style during
 childhood24 or to a high-fat diet during adolescence34
 provides additional evidence against a role for early
 nutrition in the etiology of this disease. On the other
 hand, a recent report35 suggested an increased sitting-
 to-standing height ratio among cases compared with
 controls. This finding was interpreted by the authors
 as reflecting increased levels of testosterone during
 puberty in the cases.

 Although prostate cancer is usually not regarded as

 related to smoking, the results of two recent cohort
 studies have indicated that tobacco use may be associ?
 ated with a slightly increased risk of prostate cancer.26,36
 We did not find any evidence for such an association
 in our data.

 The dietary questionnaire used in this study was
 limited to items that were suspected to be associated
 with cancer (for example, high-animal fat items for
 breast and prostate cancers) at the time the study
 began, and it was not comprehensive enough to permit
 estimation of caloric intake. Our inability to adjust for
 energy intake in this analysis, however, is unlikely to
 be a major flaw, since calories did not modify the
 association with fat in a study in which it was meas?
 ured,22 and since prostate cancer has not been consist?
 ently associated with obesity (a correlate of high caloric
 intake).

 Several mechanisms have been proposed for a pro-

 motional effect of animal fat, including an effect on
 sex hormone levels.7 When a group of white and black
 American men were transferred from a customary
 Western diet with 40% of calories from fat to a vege?
 tarian diet with 30% of calories from fat, there was a
 decrease in their urinary levels of androgens and estro-
 27
 gens.

 If dietary fat has its effect at a late stage in the
 development of prostate cancer, then diet assessment
 close to the date of diagnosis (as is usual in case-control
 studies) might be more relevant than measurements
 taken at a much earlier time (as has been typical in
 cohort studies), possibly explaining the lack of consist?
 ency in the results from cohort studies on dietary fat
 and prostate cancer.7 Misclassification on exposure
 would be particularly likely to result in studies with
 extended follow-up if dietary change occurred over
 time. This does not seem to have been a problem in
 the present data, since similar associations were found
 for cases that occurred early and late during the study,
 possibly because our median follow-up was relatively
 short (6 years).

 The relation between prostate cancer and fruits and

 vegetables and their constituents is also unclear at
 present. Several studies, including some cohort studies,

 Although a formal validation of the questionnaire
 used in this cohort has not been conducted, we have
 tested the reproducibility of the dietary data among
 cohort members who also responded to a more detailed
 questionnaire more than 1 year later.3 For these sub?
 jects (N = 4,570), we compared the reported frequency
 of intake for 12 foods and five beverages that overlap
 between the two questionnaires. We found correla?
 tions in the range of 0.3-0.7 (LN Kolonel, LR Wilkens,
 and L Le Marchand, unpublished data), comparable
 with other reports in the literature.37,38 There is little
 reason to believe that the extent of any misclassification
 was different in cases and noncases and, consequently,
 that the observed associations were spurious. Flegal et
 al39 have shown that, when there is a true association,
 the grouping of continuous data into categories can
 lead to differential misclassification and over- or under-
 estimation of the true effect, owing to the fact that
 subjects near the cutpoints may be assigned to the
 wrong category. When we entered the high-animal fat
 variables as continuous variables (after log transforma?
 tion) into the model, our risk estimates remained
 unchanged, arguing against the possibility of serious
 differential misclassification from categorization of ex?
 posure variables in this study.

 Two potential sources of bias in cohort studies?

 attrition and incomplete case ascertainment?are un?
 likely to have been major problems in this study owing
 to the geographical stability of our cohort and the use
 of a statewide registry with virtually complete ascer?
 tainment.
