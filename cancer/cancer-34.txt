Background: Dietary carbohydrates vary in their ability to raise blood glucose and insulin levels, which, in
turn, influence levels of sex hormones and insulin-like growth factors. We analyzed the effect of type and
amount of carbohydrates on ovarian cancer risk, using the glycemic index (GI) and the glycemic load (GL)
measurement in a large case–control study conducted in Italy.
Materials and methods: Cases  included  1031  women  with  incident,  histologically  confirmed  epithelial
ovarian  cancer,  from  four  Italian  regions.  Controls  included  2411  women  admitted  to  the  same  hospital
networks for acute, non-neoplastic conditions. Average daily GI and GL were calculated from a validated
food frequency questionnaire. Odds ratios (OR) and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) were
computed using multiple logistic regression.
Results: Ovarian cancer was directly associated with dietary GI (OR for highest versus lowest quartile = 1.7,
95%  CI  1.3–2.1) and  GL (OR  = 1.7,  95%  CI 1.3–2.1). The  associations were observed in  pre- and  post-
menopausal women, and they remained consistent across strata of major covariates identified.
Conclusions: This study supports the hypothesis of a direct association between GI and GL and ovarian
cancer  risk  and,  consequently,  of  a  possible  role  of  hyperinsulinemia/insulin  resistance  in  ovarian  cancer
development.
Key words: carbohydrate, case–control study, glycemic load, ovarian cancer

Introduction
Ovarian  cancer  is  directly  related  to  nulliparity,  and  inversely
related to oral contraceptive use, but little is known of its poten-
tial dietary correlates [1]. It has been suggested that diet may have
a  potential  influence  on  ovarian  carcinogenesis,  and  several
case–control studies have reported a beneficial effect on the risk
of ovarian cancer of a diet rich in vegetables [2, 3]. A few case–
control  studies  showed  that  women  with  cancer  of  the  ovary
reported more frequent meat consumption [4, 5], and others sug-
gested that a diet rich in eggs may also increase the risk of ovarian
cancer [2, 6]. Fish, on the other hand, seemed to exert a protective
effect [5, 6].

With reference to specific nutrients, descriptive epidemiology
and  ecological  studies  have  reported  positive  relationships
between fat, protein and total calory intake, and ovarian cancer

risk [7]. Data from analytical, mainly case–control studies sup-
ported the hypothesis of a possible increased risk in relation to
various types of fat [2, 6]. Carbohydrates have also been shown to
increase the risk of epithelial ovarian cancer [8].

Different  carbohydrates,  however,  affect  blood  glucose  and
insulin levels to varying degrees depending on the nature of the
carbohydrate and the type and extent of food processing [9]. On
this basis they have been ranked using the glycemic index (GI)
and  glycemic  load  (GL).  Foods  with  high  GI  tend  to  increase
glucose and insulin levels to a greater extent than low GI foods
[9]. In turn, it has been proposed that insulin may be directly or
indirectly  involved  in  the  carcinogenic  process  by  modulating
hormonal levels such as sex hormones and insulin-like growth
factors (IGF) [10]. High-GL diets have been directly associated
with risk of various Western chronic conditions, including dia-
betes [11], coronary heart disease [12], colorectal [13] and breast
[14]  cancer,  and  high  insulin  levels  may  be  one  of  the  mech-
anisms of action of risk factors shared by these diseases [15].

We  thus  evaluated  the  possible  differential  effects  of carbo-
hydrate-rich foods on epithelial ovarian cancer risk by means of
the GI and GL measurements in a large case–control study.

Materials and methods

A multicenter case–control study of ovarian cancer was conducted between
January 1992 and September 1999 in four Italian regions: Greater Milan, the
provinces of Pordenone, Padua and Gorizia (north-eastern Italy); the province
of Latina (central Italy); and the urban area of Naples (southern Italy).

Cases included women with incident, histologically confirmed epithelial
ovarian cancer diagnosed within 1 year prior to interview and with no previ-
ous diagnosis of cancer. Overall, 1031 women aged 18–79 years (median age
56 years) were included. Controls included patients with no history of cancer
who were admitted to hospitals serving the same areas as those where cases
had  been  identified.  Eligible  diagnoses  were  acute,  non-neoplastic,  non-
gynecological conditions, unrelated to hormonal or digestive tract diseases,
or  associated  with  long-term  modifications  of  diet.  They  included  2411
women, aged 17–79 years (median age 57 years), belonging to the following
diagnostic  categories:  trauma,  mostly  fractures  and  sprains  (26%);  other
orthopedic disorders, such as low back pain and disc disorders (28%); acute
surgical conditions (15%); and other illnesses, such as eye, ear, nose, skin and
dental conditions (31%). Cases were frequency matched to controls accord-
ing to quinquennium of age and area of residence. Approximately 4% of cases
and controls approached for interview during their hospital stay refused to
participate.

The same structured questionnaire and coding manual were used in each
center, and all interviewers were centrally trained and routinely supervised.
The  checking  of  data  for  consistency  and  reliability  was  also  conducted
centrally.  The  questionnaire  included  information  on  sociodemographic
characteristics, such as education and occupation, lifelong smoking habits,
physical  activity  at  various  ages,  anthropometric  measures,  a  problem-
oriented  personal  medical  history,  family  history  of  selected  cancers,
menstrual  and  reproductive  history,  history  of  use  of  oral  contraceptives,
hormone replacement treatment, and female hormone-containing drugs for
other indications. Dietary habits were investigated through an interviewer-
administered  food  frequency  questionnaire  (FFQ)  that  included  78  items.
This questionnaire was used to assess the subjects’ habitual diet during the
2  years  prior  to  cancer  diagnosis  or  hospital  admission  (for  controls),  and
included questions on the average weekly frequency of consumption of foods
or food groups, as well as complex recipes. Satisfactory reproducibility [16]
and validity [17] of the FFQ have been reported. Details on methodology used
have  been  described  elsewhere  [13,  14].  To  compute  energy  and  nutrient
intake,  an  Italian  food-composition  database  was  used.  For  each  food,  we
expressed GI as a percentage of the glycemic response elicited using ‘white
bread’ as a standard food. We then calculated daily average GI by summing
the products of the carbohydrate content per serving for each food or recipe,
multiplied by the average number of servings of that food per week, multi-
plied  by  its  GI,  all  divided  by  the  total  amount  of  available  carbohydrate
weekly  intake.  This  represents  the  ‘quality  of  the  carbohydrates’,  namely
slow versus fast absorbable carbohydrates. A score for the daily average GL
was computed as the GI, but without dividing by the total amount of carbo-
hydrates. For these calculations we used the carbohydrate content of 50 foods
or  recipes,  since  28  foods  or  recipes,  chiefly  cheese,  meat  and fish-based,
contained a negligible amount of carbohydrate. With respect to GI values, we
chiefly used international tables. In order to take into account Italian cooking
habits (e.g. pasta ‘al dente’), Italian sources were used for a few local recipes.
Food items for which a GI had not been determined were assigned the GI of
the nearest comparable food (e.g. tangerines were assigned the same GI as
oranges).

Odds ratios (ORs) and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) for
quartiles of GI and GL intake were computed using unconditional multiple
logistic regression models [18]. The regression equations included terms for
quinquennia of age, study center, years of education, occupational physical
activity, history of diabetes, oral contraceptive use, parity, menopausal status,

79

number  of  daily  meals,  intakes  of  fiber,  alcohol  and  total  energy  intake.
Adjustment for energy was made using the residuals method. The modifying
effect of various covariates was evaluated comparing the differences between
the –2 log likelihood of the model with and without interaction terms, and
referring it to the chi square distribution with degrees of freedom equal to the
number of interaction terms minus one.

Results

Table 1 gives the distribution of ovarian cancer cases and control
subjects according to age, education, menopausal status and other
potential confounding factors. Cases were better educated than
controls, had a lower parity, frequently reported a family history
of ovarian and/or breast cancer, and a lower occupational phys-
ical activity.

GI  was  positively  correlated  with  GL  (Pearson  correlation
coefficient, r = 0.53), intake of bread (r = 0.59), cereals (r = 0.56),
cakes and sweets (r = 0.33), sugar (r = 0.26), available carbo-
hydrates  (r  =  0.37),  cereal  fibre  (r  =  0.42),  and  negatively
correlated  with  fruit  (r  =  –0.19)  and  vegetables  (r  =  –0.11).
Correlations  of  GI  with  other  dietary  and  non-dietary  factors
were weak (i.e. |r| < 0.10).

Table 2 shows the ORs of epithelial ovarian cancer according
to the quartiles of GI and GL, and total carbohydrate intake by
menopausal status. Dietary GI and GL were directly associated
with  ovarian  cancer  risk,  and  the  ORs,  for  the  highest  versus
the  lowest  quartile,  were  1.7  (95%  CI  1.3–2.1)  and  1.7  (95%
CI 1.3–2.1), respectively. However, ORs by quartile of GI and
GL did not show linear trends, but were already elevated in the
second  quartile  and  tended  to  plateau  thereafter.  Associations,
particularly for GI, were appreciably stronger in postmenopausal
compared with premenopausal women, although no significant
heterogeneity  emerged.  Total  carbohydrate  intake  was  also
associated with ovarian cancer (OR = 1.8, in the highest quartile,
95% CI 1.3–2.4) in postmenopausal women (Table 2).

Table  3  shows  the  relationship  between  GI  and  epithelial
ovarian  cancer  in  different  strata  of  known  or  suspected  risk
factors for ovarian cancer. No substantial effect modification was
apparent in strata of: family history of ovarian or breast cancer;
oral contraceptive use; and parity.

The relationship between GI and epithelial ovarian cancer risk
was also analyzed in separate strata of history of diabetes, body
mass index (BMI), BMI increase from age 30, waist to hip (W/H)
ratio, occupational physical activity and alcohol intake (Table 4).
There was no consistent pattern of risk among diabetic subjects
or in different strata of BMI, BMI increase from age 30, and W/H
ratio. There was, however, a significant modifying effect of alco-
hol, with no consistent association with GI in alcohol abstainers.
The association with GI was stronger in women reporting higher
physical activity.

Although risk factors, including dietary factors, may differ in
their  relationship  to  specific  histological  subtypes  of  ovarian
cancer [19], no relevant difference emerged when we replicated
the  analyses  for  GI  and  GL  in  invasive  serous  ovarian  cancer
only. Other histological subtypes represented <10% of cases in
our data set.

Discussion

The present study shows direct associations between dietary GI
and GL and epithelial ovarian cancer risk. An elevated risk was
found in the second quartile of GI and GL, but did not show a
further increase in the third and fourth (highest) quartile. These
associations were consistent across different strata of known or
potential risk factors for ovarian cancer. However, the relation-
ship between GI and epithelial ovarian cancer in our study was
somewhat  stronger  in  post-  compared  with  premenopausal
women, and in women without a family history and in parae.

Diets with high GI or GL are associated with a high consump-
tion of refined carbohydrates, which are quickly absorbed and are
capable of elevating blood glucose and insulin level to a greater

extent  than  slowly  absorbed  ones,  such  as  pulses  and  whole
grains, which are low GI foods [20]. The main sources of carbo-
hydrates in the Italian population are bread, a high GI food, and
pasta, a medium-low GI food, representing 20.5% and 13.4% of
total carbohydrate intake, respectively [13].

High insulin levels have been suggested as a potential unifying
mechanism  for  the  risk  of  several  Western  chronic  diseases
related to high intakes of energy, fat, refined carbohydrates, and
low physical activity and obesity [15]. Central obesity (i.e. high
W/H ratio) was associated with ovarian cancer risk in this study
[21]. Diabetes, which is characterized by high insulin levels in its
early stages,  was considered  as a possible correlate of ovarian
cancer risk. However, in line with other studies [22, 23] a history
of diabetes was not found to consistently affect ovarian cancer

risk in the present study. This could, however, have resulted from
the small absolute number of diabetic subjects (∼4%).

Insulin  is  a  growth  factor  for  cancer  cells,  and  it  has  been
shown to act as a cancer promoter in in vitro and in animal studies
[15, 24]. Insulin also has affinity for IGF receptors, particularly
the IGF-1 receptor, which has strong mitogenic effects on normal
and  neoplastic  cells,  including  ovarian  carcinoma  cell  lines,
where it has been found at higher levels than in non-malignant
cells [25]. Epidemiological evidence suggests a promoting effect
of hyperinsulinemia [15] and of IGF-1 in carcinogenesis [25].

Insulin and IGF-1 are also powerful negative regulators of sex
hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) synthesis in vitro, and they
may stimulate ovarian cancer proliferation through a hormonal
pathway  [26].  An  interaction  between  insulin,  IGFs  and  sex
hormones has also been suggested for breast cancer [27].

As in most case–control studies, recall and selection biases are
possible [18]. However, awareness about any dietary hypotheses,
and particularly those related to GI and GL, for ovarian cancer was
limited in the Italian population when the study was conducted.
While  it  is  conceivable  that  dietary  habits  of  hospital  controls
may  have  differed  from  those  of  the  general  population,  great
attention was paid in this study to minimize bias by excluding
control  subjects  admitted  for  conditions  that  might  have  been
associated with special dietary habits. Of greater concern is the
early  weight  loss  often  occurring  in  ovarian  cancer  patients,
which may have led cases to increase their energy and, hence,
carbohydrate  intake  [21].  We  had,  however,  information  on
weight loss during the year prior to cancer diagnosis or interview.
Stratification and adjustment for weight or recent weight loss did
not  modify  the  association  with  GI  and  GL.  Interviewing  all
subjects in a hospital setting may have allowed greater compar-
ability of  dietary history  between  cases  and  controls [28],  and
adjustment  for  total  energy  intake  should  have  controlled  for
potential dietary over- and under-reporting. Furthermore, parti-
cipation among eligible patients was practically complete and the
catchment areas for cases and controls were highly comparable.
GI estimates have some limitations. Some GI estimates have
been derived from small samples and their variability is unclear
[13]. Statistics on the average dietary GI and GL in the general
Italian population are not available, but intakes of bread and pasta
in the present study were similar to those reported in the Italian
population  [29].  In  addition,  it  would  be  important  to  confirm
the association between GI, GL and ovarian cancer in different
populations, since the genotype for insulin resistance may vary
between ethnic groups [30].

The major strength of this study is its uniquely large dataset,
which allowed reasonably precise risk estimates. Other strengths
include consistency of findings, when major categories of con-
trols were used separately, and its reliance on a validated food
frequency questionnaire [16, 17].

In conclusion, this study found associations between dietary
GI, GL and ovarian cancer risk, thus supporting a possible role of
insulin  and  insulin-related  factors  in  ovarian  carcinogenesis.
Similar associations were observed for colorectal [13] and breast
[14]  cancer,  indicating  the  potential  role  of  these  factors  on
several common neoplasms.
