Abstract

Background: Results from preclinical studies suggest that ﬂavonoids, which are ubiquitous in plant-based diets, lower

breast cancer risk. Epidemiologic studies of ﬂavonoid intake and breast cancer risk, however, are limited, and few
investigated associations with the more aggressive estrogen receptor (ER)–negative (ER2) tumors.

Objective: We examined the associations between 7 subclasses of dietary ﬂavonoids and invasive postmenopausal breast

cancer risk overall and by ER status in a U.S. prospective cohort.

Methods: In 1999–2000, 56,630 postmenopausal women completed detailed self-administered questionnaires, among whom

2116 invasive breast cancers were veriﬁed during a mean follow-up period of 8.5 y. Cox proportional hazards regression was

used to calculate multivariable-adjusted HRs and 95% CIs.

Results: Total ﬂavonoid intake was not associated with breast cancer risk. However, there was a modest inverse association
between ﬂavone intake and overall breast cancer risk (ﬁfth vs. ﬁrst quintile HR: 0.88; 95% CI: 0.76, 1.01; P-trend = 0.04) and
between ﬂavan-3-ol intake and risk of ER2 breast cancer (for an increment of 40 mg/d; HR: 0.81; 95% CI: 0.67, 0.97) but not for

ER-positive (ER+) breast cancer risk.
Conclusion: The inverse association of ﬂavan-3-ol intake with ER2 but not ER+ breast cancer is consistent with other studies
that suggest a beneﬁcial role of plant-based diets in ER2 breast cancer risk. J. Nutr. 144: 1603–1611, 2014.

Introduction

Despite advances in the early detection, treatment, and chemopre-
vention of breast cancer, this malignancy remains the most
commonly diagnosed non–skin cancer and the second most
common cause of cancer mortality among women in the United
States (1). Breast cancer is considered a heterogeneous disease in
that hormone receptor–positive and –negative breast cancers
differ in their etiology, response to treatment, and prognosis (2–
4). Several hormone-related risk factors such as early menarche,
late age at ﬁrst birth, and late age at menopause are more strongly
related to estrogen receptor (ER)7–positive (ER+) than ER-negative

(ER2) breast cancers, which are more aggressive and carry a
poorer 5-y prognosis (2,4,5). There are no known strategies for
reducing the risk of the difﬁcult to treat ER2 breast cancers.
However, recent studies suggest that a higher intake of fruits and
vegetables is associated with a lower risk of breast cancers (6),
especially ER2 breast cancers (7). Large pooled analyses showed
inverse associations of both serum (8) and dietary carotenoids (9)
with risk of ER2 but not ER+ tumors.

In addition to carotenoids, ﬂavonoids, including proanthocyani-
dins, are also abundant in plant foods. Comprising a large group of
polyphenolic compounds, >4000 ﬂavonoids have been identiﬁed,
with 6 principal subclasses commonly found in human diets
(anthocyanins, ﬂavan-3-ols, ﬂavanones, ﬂavones, ﬂavonols, and
isoﬂavones). Proanthocyanidins, polymers of ﬂavan-3-ols, are
concentrated in fruits (except for citrus), chocolate or cocoa, and
red wine (10,11). Although they have been less studied than the 6
subclasses of monomeric ﬂavonoids because of lack of information
to quantify their presence in food, a higher degree of polymerization
seems to be associated with stronger inverse associations with
cancer risk (12,13). These compounds are potentially effective
anticancer agents in vitro and in vivo, possibly due to their
antioxidant, anti-inﬂammatory, antiproliferative, and apoptosis-
inducing properties as shown in preclinical studies of breast cancer

(14–16). Some ﬂavonoids that are phytoestrogens, including
ﬂavones and isoﬂavones, may reduce the risk of breast cancer
through estrogen-dependent mechanisms (17).

A recent meta-analysis of both prospective cohort studies and
case-control studies suggested that intakes of ﬂavonols and
ﬂavones are associated with a lower risk of breast cancer, es-
pecially among postmenopausal women (18), but the evidence
from case-control studies that are subject to recall bias is stronger
than that from prospective cohort studies. Most early epidemi-
ologic studies of ﬂavonoids focused on single compounds in
relation to breast cancer risk, but recently available ﬂavonoid and
proanthocyanidin databases (19,20) have enabled a more com-
prehensive evaluation of ﬂavonoids and health outcomes. Fur-
thermore, few studies stratiﬁed analyses on ER status (21–23).
The present study investigated the associations of 7 subclasses of
ﬂavonoids (including total proanthocyanidins) estimated from
comprehensive USDA ﬂavonoid databases with invasive breast
cancer risk by ER status in the Cancer Prevention Study II (CPS-II)
Nutrition Cohort. The large sample size of the CPS-II Nutrition
Cohort allowed for the examination of risk by ER status.

Participants and Methods

Study population. Participants in this study were drawn from the
;98,000 women enrolled in the CPS-II Nutrition Cohort, a prospective
cohort study of cancer incidence and mortality initiated in 1992 (24).
The CPS-II Nutrition Cohort is a subset of ;1.2 million U.S. adults in
the CPS-II, a prospective cohort study of cancer mortality established by
the American Cancer Society in 1982 (25). In 1992–1993, participants
in the CPS-II cohort who resided in 21 states with population-based
cancer registries were invited to participate in the CPS-II Nutrition
Cohort study. At enrollment, participants completed a 10-page, self-
administered questionnaire that included anthropometric, demographic,
dietary, lifestyle, and medical information. Follow-up questionnaires to
update exposure information and ascertain newly diagnosed cancers
were mailed in 1997 and every other year thereafter. All aspects of the
Nutrition Cohort study were approved by the Emory University
Institutional Review Board.

Analytic cohort. Follow-up for this analysis began on the date of
completion of the 1999 follow-up questionnaire, when a 152-item
modiﬁed Willett FFQ, which included speciﬁc questions on ﬂavonoid-
rich foods and beverages, was ﬁrst administered (24). At baseline in
1999–2000, 73,640 women returned the FFQ. We excluded from the
analysis women who were lost to follow-up (n = 1752), who reported
prevalence of any cancer except for nonmelanoma skin cancer on or
before the 1999 questionnaire (n = 13,655), and who were pre- or
perimenopausal or with missing menopausal status (n = 224). We further
excluded women who reported extreme energy intakes (>3500 or <600
kcal/d) or who had >70 line items missing on the 1999 FFQ (n = 916) or
$50% ﬂavonoid-rich food items missing (n = 144). Women who were in
the top 0.1% of individual ﬂavonoid subclass intake were also excluded
to limit over-reporting (n = 319). A total of 56,630 postmenopausal
women were included in the analytic cohort.

Exposure assessment. For each line item on the FFQ, a common food
or beverage serving size was speciﬁed [e.g., 1 banana or 8 ounces (;237
mL) soy milk]. Participants were asked how often, on average, they had
consumed this amount over the previous year. The possible frequency
responses ranged from ‘‘never’’ to ‘‘5 or more per week,’’ or to ‘‘6 or more
times per day,’’ depending on the item. Dietary intake of 6 subclasses of
ﬂavonoids and total proanthocyanidins were derived from 3 USDA
databases (20,26,27) as well as other literature (28–30) as described
elsewhere (31). Total proanthocyanidins were the sum of monomers,
dimers, trimers, 4–6 mers, 7–10 mers, and >10 mers as well as theaﬂavins
and thearubigins, which are derived tannins. Total ﬂavonoids were
deﬁned as the sum of the 7 subclasses (anthocyanidins, ﬂavones,

1604 Wang et al.

ﬂavanones, ﬂavan-3-ols, ﬂavonols, isoﬂavones, and proanthocyanidins),
including both monomeric and polymeric ﬂavonoids. Percentage con-
tributions of food sources to ﬂavonoids were calculated among all
participants as the ratio of total intake of ﬂavonoids from a food source
divided by the total amount of ﬂavonoids consumed in the population
(Supplemental Table 1).

Outcome ascertainment. Follow-up for the analytic cohort started
from the return of the 1999 FFQ and ended at the date of breast cancer
diagnosis or breast cancer death, date of other death, date of last survey
returned, or 30 June 2009, whichever came ﬁrst. During a mean follow-
up period of 8.5 y, 2116 invasive breast cancers were identiﬁed, includ-
ing 1498 ER+ cases and 218 ER2 cases. A majority of the incident cases
(n = 2075) were self-reported and veriﬁed subsequently through medi-
cal records (n = 1671) or through linkage with state cancer registries
(n = 404). Three self-reported cases that were not veriﬁed were identiﬁed
through linkage with the National Death Index (32). Another 13 cases
that were not self-reported were identiﬁed through medical records
(n = 2) or linkage with state cancer registry (n = 11) during the process of
verifying another cancer. Fatal breast cancer cases (n = 25) that were not
reported were identiﬁed through linkage with the National Death Index,
and 17 of these were veriﬁed through state cancer registries.

Statistical analysis. Energy-adjusted ﬂavonoid intakes, calculated by
using the residual method (33), were examined as categorical variables in
quintiles based on distributions in the entire cohort as well as continuous
variables with ;1 SD as the incremental unit. Cox proportional hazards
regression models were used to calculate HRs and 95% CIs for breast
cancer risk by quintile of ﬂavonoid intake and by continuous form. When
ER+ and ER2 cases were examined as separate outcomes, cases that were
non-ER+ or non-ER2, including those missing ER status, were censored.
Age was adjusted in all Cox models by stratifying on single year of
age at enrollment. For other covariates, missing values <5% were
included in the largest category; otherwise missing values were grouped
as an ‘‘unknown’’ category. Additional covariates controlled for in the
multivariable models included family history of breast cancer (yes, no/
unknown), history of breast cyst (yes, no/unknown), weight gain since
age 18 y ($24.5–4.5 kg, >4.5–9 kg, >9–18 kg, >18–25 kg, >25 kg,
unknown), education (less than high school graduate, high school grad-
uate, some college, college graduate or higher/unknown), combination
of parity and age at ﬁrst live birth (nulliparous; 1–2, <25 y; 1–2, $25 y;
$3, <25 y/unknown; $3, $25 y), age at menopause (#44 y, 45–49 y,
50–54 y/unknown, $55 y), ethanol intake (no consumption/unknown,
<14 g/d, $14 g/d), smoking history (never/unknown, former, current),
and energy intake (quintiles). History of postmenopausal hormone
therapy was included in the model as a time-dependent variable. Energy-
adjusted dietary total carotenoid intake was also considered in a separate
model that included all of the above covariates. Other potential
confounders examined included age at menarche, BMI, saturated fat
intake, history of mammography, multivitamin use, physical activity,
and race. These variables were not included in the ﬁnal model because
their inclusion did not change the HR in the top category of exposures
>3%. Trend tests were conducted by assigning each quintile its median
value and modeling the exposure as a continuous variable.

We examined interactions between total ﬂavonoid intake and BMI
(<25 kg/m2, $25 kg/m2), weight change since age 18 (#9 kg, >9 kg),
smoking status (never, ever), and ethanol intake (none, any) by using the
likelihood ratio test (34). SAS version 9.3 (SAS Institute) was used to
conduct all statistical analyses. All P values are 2-sided and considered
signiﬁcant at the <0.05 level.

Results

The top 10 food contributors to total ﬂavonoids and each
ﬂavonoid subclass are listed in Supplemental Table 1. Although
in some cases a single food item was the primary contributor to
some ﬂavonoids (e.g., nonherbal tea to ﬂavan-3-ols and tofu/soy
beans to isoﬂavones), most of the ﬂavonoids were derived from
multiple major foods or beverages. As shown in Table 1, women

with higher total ﬂavonoid intake at baseline were more likely to
have a history of breast cysts, a higher educational level, had 1–2
live births, and a later age at menopause. They also engaged in
healthier lifestyle behaviors. They were leaner and less likely to
gain >18 kg after age 18 y, to smoke, or to consume $14 g (;1
serving) of alcohol/d. They were more likely to have mammo-
graphic screening, take multivitamin supplements regularly,
and exercise frequently. As expected, women who consumed
high dietary ﬂavonoids reported high consumption of tea,
wine, fruits and vegetables, and dietary total carotenoids
(Table 1).

Total ﬂavonoid intake was not associated with overall breast
cancer risk in age- or multivariable-adjusted models (Table 2). There
was a suggestive inverse association between ﬂavone intake in both
categorical (P-trend = 0.04) and continuous (for an increment of
1 mg/d; HR: 0.96; 95% CI: 0.92, 1.00) forms and risk, although the
HR of the top vs. bottom quintile (HR: 0.88; 95% CI: 0.76, 1.01; P =
0.06) was not signiﬁcant. Furthermore, the suggestive inverse trend
was no longer signiﬁcant after further adjustment for total carot-
enoid intake (P-trend = 0.12; data not shown), which was likely due
to the high correlation between ﬂavones and total carotenoids
(SpearmanÕs correlation coefﬁcient = 0.51, P < 0.0001).

In analyses stratiﬁed on ER status (Table 3), there were no
associations between any ﬂavonoid quintiles and risk of ER+ or
ER2 breast cancer. Analyses of continuous ﬂavonoids revealed a
suggestive lower risk of ER+ breast cancer for every 1-mg/d
increase in dietary ﬂavones (HR: 0.96; 95% CI: 0.91, 1.00) and a
19% lower risk of ER2 breast cancer (HR: 0.81; 95% CI: 0.67,
0.97) for an increment of 40 mg/d of dietary ﬂavan-3-ols (;1 SD).
The association of ﬂavan-3-ols with ER2 remained signiﬁcant
after further adjustment for dietary total carotenoid intake (HR:
0.81; 95% CI: 0.67, 0.98; data not shown). No signiﬁcant
interactions were observed between any ﬂavonoids and BMI (<25
kg/m2, $25 kg/m2), weight gain from age 18 y (#9 kg, >9 kg),
smoking status (never, ever), or alcohol consumption (none, any).

Discussion

This study investigated the associations of 7 subclasses of
ﬂavonoids with invasive breast cancer incidence by ER status in

1606 Wang et al.

a cohort of postmenopausal women. Although total ﬂavonoid
intake was not associated with invasive breast cancer risk
overall, ﬂavones, found primarily in vegetables (e.g., peppers,
celery), showed a suggestive inverse association with risk. In
addition, women with a higher intake of ﬂavan-3-ols were at
lower risk of ER2, but not ER+, breast cancer.

Our ﬁnding that ﬂavone intake was inversely associated
with all invasive breast cancer risk among these postmeno-
pausal women was consistent with the results from a recent
meta-analysis (18). The meta-analysis of 6 prospective cohort
studies and 6 case-control studies on ﬂavonoid intake and
breast cancer revealed a 17% and 12% lower risk of breast
cancer in women with high intakes of ﬂavones and ﬂavonols,
respectively (18). Although other prospective cohort studies
have been null (21,35–39), signiﬁcant inverse associations
between ﬂavonoid intake and breast cancer risk were shown
in 3 case-control studies (23,40,41). The Long Island Breast
Cancer Study Project with population-based, age-matched
controls found that higher reported intakes of ﬂavones,
ﬂavonols, and ﬂavan-3-ols consumed 1 y before diagnosis
were inversely associated with overall breast cancer risk,
mostly among postmenopausal women (23). Two other
hospital-based case-control studies also reported inverse associ-
ations between ﬂavone intake and risk of breast cancer (40,41).
The main food sources of ﬂavones in the current study were
green or red peppers, oranges, and celery, although oranges are
also rich in ﬂavanones. Although isoﬂavones, key phytoestro-
gens, have been widely studied in relation to breast cancer risk,
recent meta-analyses revealed signiﬁcant inverse associations
from studies in Asian countries but not from Western coun-
tries, where intake is dramatically lower (42,43). In the present
study, isoﬂavone intake was not associated with breast cancer
risk. The low amount and narrow range of isoﬂavone intake in
the present study (median: 0.03 mg/d; range: 0.02–45.0 mg/d),
similar to amounts reported in most Western countries, limits
the ability to detect associations with breast cancer risk, if
one exists.

An advantage of this study was the examination of risk by ER
status of the tumor, which has been reported in only 3 other
studies (21–23). Two case-control studies that stratiﬁed on ER and
progesterone receptor (PR) status had inconsistent results (22,23).

ethanol consumption, smoking history, total energy intake in quintile, and history of hormone replacement therapy (time-dependent).
3 The incremental units were calculated as the approximate values of an SD. The increments are 220 mg/d for total ﬂavonoids, 10 mg/d for anthocyanidins, 40 mg/d for ﬂavan-3-
ols, 20 mg/d for ﬂavanones, 1 mg/d for ﬂavones, 10 mg/d for ﬂavonols, 3 mg/d for isoﬂavones, and 170 mg/d for proanthocyanidins.
4 Test for trend by using median values for each category and modeling as a continuous variable.

2 Adjusted for age, family history of breast cancer, history of breast cyst, weight gain since age 18 y, education, combination of parity and age at ﬁrst live birth, age at menopause,
ethanol consumption, smoking history, total energy intake in quintile, and history of hormone replacement therapy (time-dependent).
3 The incremental units were calculated as the approximate values of an SD. The increments are 220 mg/d for total ﬂavonoids, 10 mg/d for anthocyanidins, 40 mg/d for ﬂavan-3-
ols, 20 mg/d for ﬂavanones, 1 mg/d for ﬂavones, 10 mg/d for ﬂavonols, 3 mg/d for isoﬂavones, and 170 mg/d for proanthocyanidins.
4 Test for trend by using median values for each category and modeling as a continuous variable.

Cho et al. (22) reported an inverse association between isoﬂavone
intake and overall breast cancer risk among postmenopausal
women; when examined by ER status, the inverse association
persisted only for ER2 breast cancer. Fink et al. (23) reported
inverse associations for ﬂavone, ﬂavonol, and ﬂavan-3-ol intakes
with postmenopausal breast cancer risk overall, and ﬂavones and
ﬂavonols were associated with lower risk of ER+/PR+ and all
other types (as 1 group), whereas ﬂavan-3-ols were not associated
with risk of any type. In the EPIC (European Prospective
Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition) study, a large multina-
tional cohort study, intake of dietary ﬂavonoids and lignans
(another class of polyphenols) was not associated with risk of
breast cancer overall or by joint ER and PR status (21). In the
present study, we observed signiﬁcant inverse associations be-
tween ﬂavan-3-ol intake and incidence of ER2, but not ER+,
breast tumors. Although the ﬁnding might be due to chance,
experimental studies had results that are consistent with the
observed inverse association. Epigallocatechin gallate, a primary
ﬂavan-3-ol in green tea, has been suggested to be a potential
anticarcinogenic agent for ER2 breast cancer. In ER2 human
breast cancer cell lines, epigallocatechin gallate inhibited breast
cancer cell proliferation (44,45) and induced apoptosis (46). In
a recent study, epigallocatechin gallate was also found to
reactivate ER-a expression in an ER2 breast cancer cell line
through inﬂuencing epigenetic processes (47). Our ﬁndings
need to be conﬁrmed in future studies.

Identifying the independent associations of speciﬁc dietary
components with cancer risk is difﬁcult because many com-
pounds are present in the same food groups. In the present
study, dietary ﬂavone intake was inversely associated with
invasive breast cancer; however, the association was no longer
signiﬁcant after further adjustment for total carotenoid intake.
One plausible cause is the collinearity between these 2
compounds that are often found in the same fruits and
vegetables. On the other hand, the inverse association between
dietary ﬂavan-3-ols and ER2 breast cancer was not affected by
control for carotenoid consumption, probably because >50%
of the dietary ﬂavan-3-ols were from tea and only a small
portion of ﬂavan-3-ols share common food sources with
carotenoids. We did not include carotenoids in our main
multivariable models because their shared food sources may
represent overcontrol.

This study has several strengths, including its large sample
size, prospective design with 10 y of follow-up, and use of
comprehensive ﬂavonoid databases. It also has limitations.
Dietary estimates based on FFQs are subject to error resulting
from the ﬁnite food list and potential misreporting of
retrospective food intake (48). In a prospective study, these
sources of error might lead to random misclassiﬁcation of
exposure, which could attenuate possible associations. How-
ever, although the FFQ used to estimate ﬂavonoid intake was
not validated in the CPS-II cohort speciﬁcally, the instrument
on which our FFQ is based has been validated in similar
populations (49,50), and we previously showed that dietary
ﬂavonoid intake was inversely associated with cardiovascular
disease mortality in the CPS-II Nutrition Cohort
(51),
consistent with expectations and supporting the predictive
validity of our dietary data. In the current study, it is possible
that we may have missed stronger inverse associations of
ﬂavonoid intake with breast cancer incidence because of
greater under-reporting of energy intake and over-reporting
of fruit and vegetable intake among overweight or obese
women (52,53), who are at higher risk of breast cancer.
Although available potential confounders were examined in
multivariable models, residual confounding due to other
unmeasured factors and incomplete classiﬁcation of cova-
riates may inﬂuence the risk estimates in this study.

Although total ﬂavonoid intake was not associated with overall
breast cancer risk, ﬂavones were associated with a borderline lower
risk of invasive breast cancers in our study. Moreover, this study
showed a signiﬁcant inverse association between ﬂavan-3-ol intake
and ER2, but not ER+, breast cancer risk. Our ﬁnding for ﬂavan-
3-ols and ER2 breast cancer is consistent with other research that
suggests a role of plant-based diets in reducing the risk of ER2
breast cancer. Future pooled analysis of large cohort studies is
warranted to replicate the ﬁndings.
