Abstract—Both carcinogenic and anticarcinogenic properties have been reported for the synthetic anti-
oxidants butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT). The association between
dietary intake of BHA and BHT and stomach cancer risk was investigated in the Netherlands Cohort Study
(NLCS) that started in 1986 among 120,852 men and women aged 55 to 69 years. A semi-quantitative food
frequency questionnaire was used to assess food consumption. Information on BHA or BHT content of
cooking fats, oils, mayonnaise and other creamy salad dressings and dried soups was obtained by chemical
analysis, a Dutch database of food additives (ALBA) and the Dutch Compendium of Foods and Diet Pro-
ducts. After 6.3 years of follow-up, complete data on BHA and BHT intake of 192 incident stomach cancer
cases and 2035 subcohort members were available for case-cohort analysis. Mean intake of BHA or BHT
among subcohort members was 105 and 351 (cid:22)g/day, respectively. For consumption of mayonnaise and other
creamy salad dressings with BHA or BHT no association with stomach cancer risk was observed. A statisti-
cally non-signiﬁcant decrease in stomach cancer risk was observed with increasing BHA and BHT intake
[rate ratio (RR) highest/lowest intake of BHA=0.57 (95% conﬁdence interval (CI): 0.25–1.30] and
BHT=0.74 (95% CI: 0.38–1.43). In this study, no signiﬁcant association with stomach cancer risk was found
for usual intake of low levels of BHA and BHT. # 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved

oxidative deterioration (Addis, 1986). Moreover, BHA
and BHT are synthetic phenolic compounds, which are
the two most widely applied synthetic antioxidants that
have been used since the 1950s (IARC, 1986a,b). BHA
and BHT are present in small amounts in many com-
mercial foods and thus constitute a small fraction of
the diet of many people (Hocman, 1988).

BHA and BHT were observed to act as antic-
arcinogens in various animal models (Hocman, 1988;
Wattenberg, 1972, 1986; Wattenberg et al., 1980;
Williams, 1986; Williams and Iatropoulos, 1996). On
the other hand, results have also been reported for

the carcinogenicity of BHA and BHT in experi-
mental animals (Hocman, 1988; Ito et al., 1983;
Williams, 1986). Originally, BHA appeared to have
initiating as well as promoting action (Ito et al.,
1986b). Recently, it was established that tumor for-
mation appears to involve only tumor promotion
(Williams et al., 1999). The target organ for BHA is
the forestomach, an organ only present in rodents,
whereas BHT has carcinogenic eects in the liver of
rats and mice (Clayson et al., 1993; Papas, 1993;
Verhagen et al., 1991). Also, esophagus proliferation
stimulating eects of BHA have been reported in
non-rodents (pigs, monkeys) in response to BHA
administration (Papas, 1993; Verhagen et al., 1991a).
In a landmark publication in 1981 it was estimated
that food additives accounted for less than 1% of all
cancer deaths. The range of estimates for food additives
varied from +2% to (cid:255)5%, suggesting that food addi-
tives may either have a positive or negative contribution
to cancer development (Doll and Peto, 1981).

However, the eects of BHA and BHT on humans
have been limited. A study by Verhagen et al.
revealed no clinical eects (Verhagen et al., 1989a).
Because of the widespread use of BHA and BHT in
food products and as a consequence long-term and
widespread exposure of humans, it is important to
investigate the potential health risks associated with
their dietary intake. In the Netherlands Cohort
Study (NLCS), a prospective cohort study in which
various risk factors for stomach cancer have been
investigated (Botterweck et al., 1998), we were also
able to study the eect of usual BHA and BHT
intake on stomach cancer risk.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Subjects and study design

The Netherlands Cohort Study on diet and cancer
(NLCS) is a prospective cohort study which started
in September 1986 among the general population in
The Netherlands (van den Brandt et al., 1990a). The
cohort included 62,573 women and 58,279 men aged
55 to 69 yr in 1986. At baseline, the cohort members
completed a mailed, self-administered questionnaire
on dietary habits, smoking, occupation, medical his-
tory, personal and family history of cancer, and
demographic data. Follow-up for the incidence of
cancer has been established by record linkage with
cancer registries and a pathology register (van den
Brandt et al., 1990b). For data analysis the case-
cohort approach was used in which cases are derived
from the entire cohort, while the person-years at risk
of the entire cohort are estimated from a random
sample of 3500 subjects (subcohort) (Self and Pre-
ntice, 1988). This subcohort of 1812 women and 1688
men has been followed up biennially for vital status
information in order to estimate the accumulated
person time in the cohort. No subcohort members

were lost
to follow-up. The present analysis is
restricted to cancer incidence in the ﬁrst 6.3 yr of
follow-up from September 1986 until December
1992. After the exclusion of subjects reporting pre-
valent stomach cancer at base-line (n=33), cases
with in situ stomach carcinoma (n=2), and cases
without microscopically conﬁrmed stomach cancer
(n=2), there were 310 incident (242 men, 68 women)
stomach carcinoma cases remaining. In the sub-
cohort, 1630 men and 1716 women remained after
the exclusion of prevalent cancer cases other than
skin cancer.

Exposure assessment

food frequency questionnaire

For assessing BHA and BHT intake, both infor-
mation on consumption of potential BHA- and/or
BHT-containing foods and brand names of these
foods were needed. Consumption of potential BHA-
and/or BHT-containing foods was assessed using the
dietary section of the baseline questionnaire of the
NLCS. The dietary section was a 150-item semi-
con-
quantitative
centrating on usual consumption of
food and
beverages during the year preceding the start of the
study. The questionnaire was validated against a 9-
day diet record (Goldbohm et al., 1994). Among
other questions, participants were asked to report
their frequency of consumption of potential BHA-
and/or BHT-containing foods: cooking fats, oils,
dried soups (from a pack), mayonnaise and other
creamy salad dressings, potato products, cereals and
cereal products, pastry, cakes and biscuits, sugar,
sweets and sweet spreads, nuts, seeds and snacks
(Verhagen et al., 1990a). They could choose one of
six frequency categories, ranging from ‘‘never or less
than once per month’’ to ‘‘6–7 times per week’’.
Standard portion sizes were used to calculate daily
intake. Participants were asked to specify type and
brand for cooking fats (for preparing meat, ﬁsh and
chips), oils, butter, mayonnaise and other creamy salad
dressings and dried soups. Only those products with
brand names could be used to obtain information on
BHA and BHT content.

Collection of information on BHA and BHT content
of foods

Information on BHA and/or BHT content was
obtained by chemical analysis of selected potential
BHA- and/or BHT- containing foods and by the use
of two other information sources: a Dutch database
of food additives for people with food intolerance
and allergy (ALBA) and the Dutch Compendium of
Foods and Diet Products (Compendium of Food
and Diet Products, 1989/1990).

Chemical analysis

The most frequently mentioned brand names of
cooking fats, oils, mayonnaise and other creamy
salad dressings and dried soups in the baseline ques-
tionnaire from a random sample of 400 cohort par-

ticipants were selected in 1988. Because the fat con-
tent of dried soups is very low and as a consequence
the BHA and/or BHT content, dried soups were not
regarded as relevant for BHA and/or BHT intake.
Dried soups were therefore excluded from chemical
analysis. Although oils contain naturally occurring
tocopherols and do not require the addition of BHA
or BHT, a number of oils were still analysed. Finally,
in 1990, 55 brand-speciﬁc foods (30 mayonnaise and
other creamy salad dressings, 11 oils and 14 cooking
fats) were bought in local supermarkets and analysed
by means of HPLC.

Other data sources

The ALBA database comprises data on the pre-
sence or absence of food additives in food products
speciﬁed to type and brand for people with food
intolerance and allergy. Regarding BHA and BHT, a
list of food brand names containing BHA and/or
BHT was obtained for the year 1989. Information
before 1989 was not available.

The Compendium of Food and Diet Products con-
tains information about the composition of a selection
of (diet) foods by type and brand and is used by general
practitioners and dieticians
(Compendium, 1989/
1990). Since 1989, information about the presence of
food additives in food and diet products was added to
the Compendium. Both ALBA and the Compendium
obtained their information from food manufacturers.
We assumed that the BHA and/or BHT content of
foods in 1989/1990 was the same as in 1986.

Based on the information of these three sources, it
could be concluded that in this study only mayon-
naise and other creamy salad dressings contained
BHA or BHT. There were no foods that contained
both BHA and BHT.

Calculation of BHA and BHT intake

Foods were coded to contain BHA or BHT if at
least one of the three sources (chemical analysis,
ALBA or Compendium) showed that BHA or BHT
was present. If, in addition, the amount of BHA and/
or BHT was known by chemical analysis, this infor-
mation was also used. Foods for which no informa-
tion was available were coded as missing. Foods of
which the presence of BHA or BHT was demon-
strated but no amount of BHA or BHT was known,
the average content of BHA or BHT in mayonnaise
or other salad dressings from which the BHA or
BHT concentration was known, was substituted.
Mean daily intake was calculated by multiplying
BHA or BHT content of foods (in mg per gram) and
consumption of mayonnaise and other creamy salad
dressings (in gram per day).

Covariates

and higher vocational school) (van Loon et al.,
1998), stomach disorders (yes or no), family history
of stomach cancer (yes or no), smoking status (never/
ex/current smoker), fruit and vegetable consumption
(in g/day)(Botterweck et al., 1998), monounsaturated
fat and polyunsaturated fat consumption (in g/day).
In this study, stomach disorders were deﬁned as hav-
ing any stomach disease in the past which required
medical attention (e.g. peptic ulcer, gastritis).

Data analysis

From an epidemiological point of view it

is
important to investigate the association between the
consumption of mayonnaise and other creamy salad
dressings per se and stomach cancer risk. All cases
(282) and subcohort members (3123) could be classi-
ﬁed as user or non-user of mayonnaise and other
creamy salad dressings. Then,
the association
between the use of mayonnaise and creamy salad
dressings with BHA or BHT and intake of BHA or
BHT and stomach cancer risk was examined. These
analysis were based on 192 cases (68.1%) and 2035
subcohort members (65.2%) with complete data on
BHA or BHT content of mayonnaise and other
creamy salad dressings. These subjects were classiﬁed
by the consumption of BHA- or BHT-containing
foods (yes or no) and categorized into three cate-
gories of BHA (0, >0–70, >70 mg/day) and BHT (0,
>0–225, >225 mg/day).

For data analysis, the GLIM statistical package was
used (Baker, 1985). Case-cohort analyses were per-
formed based on the assumption that survival times
were exponentially distributed in the follow-up period
(Self and Prentice, 1988). Speciﬁc macros were devel-
oped to account for the additional variance introduced
by using the subcohort instead of using the entire
cohort (Volovics and van den Brandt, 1997). All ana-
lyses were conducted for men and women together.
Multivariate rate ratios (RRs) of stomach cancer and
their 95% conﬁdence intervals (CI) were computed
for all variables. Tests for trend in the RRs were based
on likelihood ratio tests. The multivariate model
included age, sex, level of education, stomach dis-
orders, family history of stomach cancer and smoking
status. Other multivariate models which included also
monounsaturated fat or polyunsaturated fat or fruit
and vegetable consumption were tested too.

Because of potential inﬂuence of preclinical symp-
toms of stomach cancer on food consumption, all
analyses were also conducted after excluding cases
diagnosed in the ﬁrst and second year of follow-up
(Botterweck et al., 1998; van den Brandt et al., 1994).

RESULTS

Other factors possibly relevant for the association
between BHA and BHT and stomach cancer risk
that were measured in the baseline questionnaire
included age, sex, level of education (lower, medium

with BHA or BHT than the subcohort members.

In Table 2, the distribution of BHA or BHT intake
in cases and subcohort members is presented. Mean
intake of BHA or BHT among subcohort members
was 105 and 351 mg/day, respectively. Intake of BHA
or BHT was lower in cases at 89 and 330 mg/day,
respectively. There were small dierences in distribu-
tion of BHA or BHT intake categories between cases
and subcohort members. In the highest intake cate-
gory of the two variables the percentage of cases was
slightly lower compared to the subcohort members.

and BHT-containing foods did not change. How-
ever, the RR of BHA-containing foods decreased to
0.89 (95% CI 0.58–1.37) after exclusion of ﬁrst and
second year cases. A decreasing stomach cancer risk
was observed with increasing BHA or BHT intake.
The RRs of high intake vs low intake of BHA and
BHT were 0.84 (95% CI 0.45–1.57) and 0.82 (95%
CI 0.46–1.43), respectively. However, the RRs for
stomach cancer with each consumption category of
the two variables, nor the tests for trend were statis-
tically signiﬁcant. After exclusion of cases diagnosed
in the ﬁrst or second follow-up year, the RRs of the
highest intake of BHA and BHT compared to the
lowest intake category decreased to 0.57 (95% CI
0.25–1.30) and 0.74 (95% CI 0.38–1.43), respectively.
Again, none of the RRs were statistically signiﬁcant
dierent from unity and none of the tests for trend
were statistically signiﬁcant.

Inclusion of monounsaturated fat or poly-
unsaturated fat consumption or fruit and vegetable
consumption in the model did not change the risk
estimates.

DISCUSSION

This prospective cohort study is the ﬁrst epidemio-
logic study that evaluated the association between
dietary intake of BHA and BHT and stomach cancer
risk. We found no association between the consump-
tion of foods containing BHA or BHT and stomach
cancer risk. There seemed to be an indication for a
decreased stomach cancer risk with increasing BHA
and BHT intake.

Methodological considerations

The cohort study has been performed in a large
sample of the general population aged 55–69 yr at
baseline. After 6.3 yr of follow-up, 192 cases with
complete dietary data on BHA or BHT were avail-
able for analysis. One of the strengths of this study is
that the food consumption was measured before
stomach cancer was diagnosed, thus avoiding the
problem of biased recall of dietary habits. The fol-
low-up of person-years was 100% complete and the
completeness of cancer follow-up was also very high,
indicating that selection bias due to loss of follow-up
is unlikely. In multivariate analysis, adjustment was
made for all measured variables that were associated
with stomach cancer risk in this study. However,
residual confounding is possible because some uni-
dentiﬁed risk factors may be involved in the relation
between BHA or BHT and stomach cancer risk.
Because people with preclinical symptoms of stomach
cancer are likely to change their dietary habits months
or years before stomach cancer is diagnosed, all ana-
lyses were performed with and without cases diagnosed
in the ﬁrst and second follow-up year (Botterweck et al.,
1998; van den Brandt et al., 1994). In this study, these
analyses revealed slightly dierent RRs.

A fact that could have inﬂuenced the results is
misclassiﬁcation of exposure. The dietary question-
naire has been designed to assess an individual’s
long-term food consumption and not speciﬁcally to
assess the intake of BHA and BHT. Nevertheless, we
did have brand speciﬁc information of cooking fats,
oils, dried soups and mayonnaise and other creamy
salad dressings which were potential sources of BHA
and BHT. We did not have information on BHA or
BHT content of all foods with brand names. In the
baseline questionnaire, people reported unknown or
foreign brand names. The chemical analysis on BHA
and BHT content were performed in a selection of
foods. These were the most frequently consumed
foods reported by a sample of 400 people from the
cohort. Although this was a large sample we could
not exclude that rather frequently consumed food
products were not mentioned. Both the ALBA data-
base and The Compendium of Food and Diet Pro-
ducts obtained their
information from food
manufacturers, but not all food manufacturers pro-
vided information on food additives. Thus, we did
not have 100% complete data on BHA or BHT
content of foods. Despite that, we still could classify
nearly 70% of cases and subcohort members as to
whether or not they used BHA- or BHT-containing
foods. Furthermore, there is no reason to think that
the proportion of stomach cancer cases is dierent in
the group with and without missing data, because
information on food consumption was gathered
before stomach cancer was diagnosed. However, if
misclassiﬁcation has occurred, this is to be expected
non-dierential and risk estimates are most likely
biased towards the null value.

Interpretation of ﬁndings

In this study, the intake of BHA was 105 (range 2–
3220) mg/day and BHT was 351 (range 19–2052) mg/
day which is (approx. 10 times) lower than the
intakes estimated in other studies (Kirkpatrick and

Lauer, 1986; Van Dokkum et al., 1982; Verhagen et
al., 1990a). In our study, intake values are only based
on the consumption of mayonnaise and other creamy
salad dressings. In a Dutch market-basket study,
BHA and BHT content was obtained by chemical
analyses in samples of ﬁve out of 12 food groups
representing the basic 2-wk diet of 16–18-yr-old male
adolescents. The maximal BHA intake (BHT could
not be detected) in this Dutch market-basket study
was 4 mg/person/day (Van Dokkum et al., 1982). In
another Dutch study, the mean daily BHA and/or
BHT intake was 4.51 mg or 0.075 mg/kg/day for a
60-kg individual. The daily dietary intake of BHA
and/or BHT in this study was estimated using data
obtained from a nationwide dietary record survey
carried out in 1987/1988. The estimates were based
on the fat content of seven out of 23 selected food
categories and their respective maximum permitted
levels of BHA and/or BHT (Verhagen et al., 1990a).
The dietary intake of BHA in Canada was estimated
using dietary recall data on food consumption and
maximum permitted use levels for this antioxidant.
The BHA intake ranged from 5.5 to 12.1 mg/person/
day or 0.13 to 0.39 mg/kg body weight/day (Kirkpa-
trick and Lauer, 1986). In the latter studies, daily
intake of BHA and BHT are probably over-
estimated. The estimates are based on maximum
permitted levels of BHA and/or BHT. These esti-
mates did not account for losses during storage and
food processing, or for lower levels of BHA or BHT
in foods, because of limited use of BHA or BHT in
foods by the manufacturer, or even for the use of
other antioxidants in combination with BHA or
BHT.

In a limited experiment, the daily individual diet-
ary intake of BHA was assessed using a biological
monitoring approach which is based on the fact that
39% of a single oral dose of BHA is recovered from
the urine as phase II conjugates of BHA with glu-
curonic acid and sulfate (Verhagen et al., 1989b). Six

604

volunteers consumed foods that might contain BHA
and subsequently collected their urine for 24 hr.
Another 22 volunteers collected their urine for a 24-hr
period without having consumed speciﬁc foods.
Results of this experiment showed that the actual
intake of BHA ranged from less than 1 mg to 21.5 mg/
kg body weight (Verhagen and Kleinjans, 1991).

Finding no association between BHA and BHT
intake and stomach cancer
risk incidence sub-
stantiates the hypothesis that low intake levels of
BHA and BHT are not carcinogenic in humans. To
our knowledge, no other relevant data on the eva-
luation of carcinogenic risk in humans are available.
Therefore, the current study ﬁndings can only be
compared with ﬁndings of experimental studies in
animals on BHA and BHT. Data from animal
experimental studies reported both carcinogenic and
anticarcinogenic eects for both BHA and BHT
(IARC, 1986a,b; Ito et al., 1986b; Wattenberg, 1985;
Wattenberg et al., 1980; Williams et al., 1999). BHA
administered in the diet of rats, mice and hamsters
induced dose-dependently benign and malignant
tumours of the forestomach (Clayson et al., 1993; Ito
et al., 1983, 1986a; Masui et al., 1986; IARC, 1986a;
Williams, 1986). Not only the forestomach but also
other organs of the digestive tract (oesophagus, small
intestine and colon/rectum) seem to be potential tar-
get tissues for the carcinogenic action of BHA (Ver-
hagen et al., 1990b). When BHT was administered in
the diet of mice and rats lung and liver tumours were
induced, but there were also studies that reported no
increase in tumour incidence were reported (IARC,
1986b). When administered with known mutagens or
carcinogens, BHA and BHT either enhanced, inhib-
ited or had no eect on carcinogenity (Hocman,
1988; IARC, 1986a,b; Wattenberg, 1985, 1986; Wat-
tenberg et al., 1980; Williams, 1986). However, for
both BHA and BHT anticarcinogenic eects were
seen at low doses when given prior to and during
exposure to carcinogens (Williams and Iatropoulos,
1996; Williams et al., 1999). The International
Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) that eval-
uated BHA and BHT, concluded that there is su(cid:129)-
cient
carcinogenity of BHA in
experimental animals (IARC, 1986a), but for BHT
there is limited evidence (IARC, 1986b). Results of
experiments performed on animals are di(cid:129)cult to
compare with human data and should be interpreted
with caution. The amounts of BHA or BHT used in
the diet of animals is much higher than the levels
permitted in the human diet. Humans are exposed to
low concentrations throughout life. Furthermore,
humans do not posses a forestomach, and there are
metabolic dierences between humans and animals.
The ﬁnding of an apparent decreased risk with
increasing BHA or BHT intake seem to be more in
line with the hypothesis that synthetic antioxidants
may be protective for cancer and supports ﬁndings of
studies suggesting that low doses of BHA and BHT
inhibit carcinogenesis (Hocman, 1988; Wattenberg,

evidence

for

1986; Williams, 1986; Williams et al., 1999). Anti-
oxidants such as BHA and BHT may have beneﬁcial
eects by protecting against toxic compounds that
are derived from the destruction of nutrients and the
oxidation of fatty acids in foods (Grice et al., 1986).
In conclusion, we found no clear evidence of an
association between usual dietary intake of low levels
of BHA and BHT and the risk of stomach cancer in
humans.
