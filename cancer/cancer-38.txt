Haem in red meat (RM) stimulates the endogenous production of
mutagenic nitroso compounds (NOC). Processed (nitrite-preserved
red) meat additionally contains high concentrations of preformed
NOC. In two studies, of a fresh RM versus a vegetarian (VEG) diet
(six males and six females) and of a nitrite-preserved red meat (PM)
versus a VEG diet (5 males and 11 females), we investigated
whether processing of meat might increase colorectal cancer risk
by stimulating nitrosation and DNA damage. Meat diets contained
420 g (males) or 366 g (females) meat/per day. Faecal homogenates
from day 10 onwards were analysed for haem and NOC and asso-
ciated supernatants for genotoxicity. Means are adjusted for differ-
ences in male to female ratios between studies. Faecal NOC
concentrations on VEG diets were low (2.6 and 3.5 mmol/g) but
signiﬁcantly higher on meat diets (PM 175 ± 19 nmol/g versus RM
185 ± 22 nmol/g; P 5 0.75). The RM diet resulted in a larger pro-
portion of nitrosyl iron (RM 78% versus PM 54%; P < 0.0001) and
less nitrosothiols (RM 12% versus PM 19%; P < 0.01) and other
NOC (RM 10% versus PM 27%; P < 0.0001). There was no statis-
tically signiﬁcant difference in DNA breaks induced by faecal water
(FW) following PM and RM diets (P 5 0.80). However, PM re-
sulted in higher levels of oxidized pyrimidines (P < 0.05). Surpris-
ingly, VEG diets resulted in signiﬁcantly more FW-induced DNA
strand breaks than the meat diets (P < 0.05), which needs to be
clariﬁed in further studies. Meats cured with nitrite have the same
effect as fresh RM on endogenous nitrosation but show increased
FW-induced oxidative DNA damage.

Introduction

Red and processed (nitrite-preserved red) meat (PM) increase the risk
of colorectal cancer with PM showing higher risk estimates per gram
of intake than red meat (RM) (1–3). Heterocyclic amines—known
carcinogens (4)—are formed during cooking of meat at high temper-
atures, but this is not speciﬁc for red and PM (5).

RM intake shows a dose–response relation with the endogenous
formation of nitroso compounds (NOC), whereas there is no such
relation for white meat (6,7). This is probably due to the abundant
presence of haem in RM (8,9), which can readily become nitrosylated
and act as a nitrosating agent (10). Recently, we conﬁrmed that nitro-
syl iron (FeNO) is the main contributor to high RM diet-induced

endogenous formation of NOC (11).
In addition, nitrosothiols
(RSNO) are rapidly formed from nitrite and thiol groups at low pH
in the stomach and can be precursors for the endogenous formation of
nitrosyl haem and other NOC, such as N- and O-NOC, in the small
and large bowel (11,12).

Many NOC are known carcinogens and the alkylation of DNA can
induce G to A transitions in genes mutated in colorectal cancer such as
ras (13). The NOC-speciﬁc DNA adduct O6-carboxymethyl-2#-
deoxy-guanosine increases in exfoliated colonic cells from volunteers
fed a high RM diet (14). O6-carboxymethyl-2#-deoxy-guanosine is
not repaired by O6-alkylguanine transferase in in vitro assays and
may at least partly explain the link between meat consumption and
colorectal cancer.

PM is a mixed category of meats that are preserved by a variety of
mechanical, chemical or enzymatic procedures. Different preserva-
tives, such as nitrite and nitrate in ham and sulphur dioxide in saus-
ages, may be used. Minced products such as hamburgers may or may
not be classiﬁed as PM. In most populations on which existing epi-
demiological ﬁndings are based, PM mainly consists of processed
RMs such as beef and pork (3,15).

Supplements of nitrate have been shown to increase faecal NOC
levels (16), but it is not clear whether preservation by this method
would result in an increased endogenous NOC production, and hence
explain some of the higher colorectal cancer risk with processed as
compared with RM. In two studies, of a fresh RM (beef and pork)
versus a vegetarian (VEG) diet—referred to as the RM study—and of
a nitrite-preserved red meat (bacon, ham, luncheon meat and corned
beef) versus a VEG diet—referred to as the PM study—we investi-
gated whether this form of processing might increase colorectal
cancer risk by stimulating nitrosation and DNA damage.

Methods

Subjects
Healthy males and females from Cambridgeshire were recruited through local
advertisements. Participants had to be between 20 and 85 years of age, non-
smokers, free from diabetes and bowel disease, not taking medication affecting
the gut for at least 3 months prior to the study, not pregnant and not partici-
pating in another biochemical intervention study at the same time. Prior to the
study, subjects were examined by a medical practitioner.

All subjects received verbal and written information and signed a written
consent form. The studies were approved by the Cambridge Local Research
Ethics Committee.

Sixteen volunteers were included in the PM study (5 males and 11 females);
12 volunteers participated in the RM study (six males and six females), which
has been described previously (14).

Study design
The studies had a randomized crossover design of a high meat versus a VEG
period: PM versus VEG in the PM study and RM versus VEG in the RM
study. Each dietary period lasted at least 14 days. Subjects lived in the
volunteer suite of the MRC Dunn Human Nutrition Unit, where all food
was provided and carefully controlled and all specimens could be collected
and processed immediately. Subjects followed their normal routine but were
only allowed to consume foods and drinks prepared by the diet techni-
cians. Body weights were monitored to ensure a constant weight through-
out. Faecal samples were collected and weighed daily and radio opaque
marker capsules were taken throughout to check compliance and for the
measurement of transit time (17). After subjects had consumed each diet
for 10 days, stools were collected on dry ice for analysis of NOC, haem
and genotoxicity.

Study diets
All diets were provided as similar menus on a 3 day rotating schedule. Male
PM diets contained 420 g PM per day [given as 100 g bacon (days 1 and 2) or
pork luncheon meat (day 3) at lunch and 320 g corned beef (days 1 and 2) or
gammon (day 3) at dinner] and female PM diets contained 366 g PM per day
(given as 60 g bacon or pork luncheon meat at lunch and 306 g corned beef or
gammon at dinner). RM diets contained the same amount of meat, but lunch
was roast beef (days 1, 2 and 3) and dinner beef mince (days 1 and 3) or pork
(day 2). Over the course of the study, each volunteer consumed the same
amount of each type of meat.

Energy and macronutrient composition of the diets (Appendix) were
calculated using Data Into Nutrients for Epidemiological Research (DINER)
(18). Fat content of the diets was kept constant by exchanging protein for
carbohydrates. Energy requirements were estimated from body weight and
physical activity using standard equations for basal metabolic rate and esti-
mates of physical activity level (19). The energy intake of each participant was
matched to estimated energy requirement with 1 MJ standardized increments
(chocolate bar, shortbread or a combination of white bread, butter and mar-
malade) added to 8 MJ/day (female) or 10 MJ/day (males) basal diets.

Meat was not overcooked to minimize the formation of heterocyclic amines.
Puriﬁed water was given throughout for drinking and used for cooking and
low-nitrate vegetables were used to keep nitrate intake at constant low levels.
Tea, coffee and an aspartame-based sweetener were provided in the suite and
consumed freely, but subjects were asked to keep their intake constant during
the study.

Dietary and faecal NOC and haem
Duplicates for each daily diet were prepared. All foods consumed on 1 day
were prepared as normal, added together and diluted 1:2 in ultrapure water. The
mixture was homogenized with a food processor, snap frozen on dry ice and
stored at  20°C until analysis. Results are presented per gram of diet after
correction for dilution. For analysis of the separate nitrite-preserved red meats
consumed in the PM study, meats were cooked as normal and homogenized
and frozen separately as described above. Results are presented per gram of
cooked weight after correction for dilution.
For stool analysis, 40 g of frozen stool was thawed, diluted 1:5 in ultrapure
water and homogenized for 20 min in a stomacher (Colworth 3500, Seward
Medical, London, UK). The faecal homogenates were snap frozen on dry ice
and stored at  20°C until analysis. Results are presented per gram of faeces
after correction for dilution.

NOC were analysed using a modiﬁcation of the method previously used
(11), using an Ecomedics CLD 88 Exhalyzer (Ecomedics, Duernten, Switzer-
land). Approximately 100 ll of faecal homogenates or 500 ll of homogenized
diet or meat were weighed and incubated brieﬂy with 100 ll of an aqueous
solution of N-ethylmaleimide (50 mM) and diethylene triamine pentaacetic
acid (100 lM) to protect RSNO. Thereafter, 500 ll of a 5% (wt/vol) sulfamic
acid solution was added to remove nitrite and samples were injected into
a purge vessel kept at 60°C and ﬁlled with a standard tri-iodide reagent (20)
(38 mg I2 was added to a solution of 108 mg KI in 1 ml water; to this mixture,
13.5 ml glacial acetic acid was added) to determine total NOC. To determine
mercury(II) stable compounds, 100 ll 10 mM aqueous HgCl2 was added prior
to analysis; to determine mercury(II) and ferricyanide stable compounds, 100
ll each of 10 mM aqueous HgCl2 and 10 mM aqueous K3Fe(CN)6 solution
were added prior to analysis. RSNO were determined as the difference between
total NOC and mercury(II) stable NOC; FeNO was determined as difference
between mercury(II) stable NOC and mercury(II) and K3Fe(CN)6 stable com-
pounds. Other NOC were determined as mercury(II) and K3Fe(CN)6 stable
compounds.

Haem was analysed using the HemoQuant assay (8) as described previously
(11). Brieﬂy, 400 ll hot oxalic acid reagent (3 M oxalic acid, 0.1 M FeSO4, 60
mM uric acid and 60 mM mannitol) was added to 500 mg dietary or faecal
homogenate, mixed and incubated for 30 min at 100°C. After cooling, 1 ml 3
M KAc and 3 ml acetate/acetic acid (10/1 vol/vol) were added. To 2 ml of the
organic phase, 0.8 ml n-butanol and 6 ml 3 M KAc in 1 M KOH was added,
mixed and 1 ml of the organic phase subsequently extracted with 4 ml phos-
phoric acid/acetic acid (2 M phosphoric acid:glacial acetic acid, 9:1 vol/vol).
Fluorescence (excitation, 402 nm; ﬂuorescence, 600 nm) of the aqueous phase
was determined using a Spectramax Gemini XS ﬂuorimeter (Molecular Devi-
ces, Sunnyvale, CA). To quantify samples, dietary and faecal homogenates
were spiked with haemoglobin to obtain a calibration curve. Results are ex-
pressed as mmol/d for diets or nmol/g for faeces.

Faecal water genotoxicity with the comet assay
Faecal water (FW) was prepared by centrifuging 25 g of thawed faecal
homogenate at 50 000g for 2 h at 4°C. The clear supernatant was aliquoted,
snap frozen on dry ice and stored at  80°C until analysis.

Effect of processed and RM on endogenous nitrosation and DNA damage

Caco2 cells (European Collection of Cell Cultures, Salisbury, UK) were
cultured as monolayers in Eagle’s Minimum Essential Medium containing
10% foetal bovine serum, 2 mM L-glutamine, 1% non-essential amino acids
and 100 U/l penicillin–streptomycin (all Sigma–Aldrich, Gillingham, UK).
Cells were harvested after a 3 min incubation at 37°C with 0.25% trypsin–
ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) (Sigma–Aldrich) and resuspended in
non-supplemented Eagle’s Minimum Essential Medium. Three hundred micro-
litres of cell suspension (12  104 cells) was incubated with 300 ll FW
(50%) for 30 min at 37°C. A quality control was included in each experiment.
Samples were measured in duplicate in separate experiments.

Cells were centrifuged at 200g for 3 min at 4°C, the supernatant was dis-
carded and cells were resuspended in 420 ll 1% low melting point agarose
made in phosphate-buffered saline. Cells from one treatment were divided as
roughly equal drops of 70 ll over three microscope slides (two gels per
slide), a 22  22 mm coverslip was applied and gels were allowed to set at
4°C. Coverslips were removed and cells were lysed in 2.5 M NaCl; 0.1 M
Na2EDTA; 10 mM Tris–HCl, pH 10 and 1% Triton X-100 for 1 h at 4°C.
Microscope slides had been precoated with 1% normal melting point agarose
and left to dry before use.

Slides were rinsed in enzyme buffer (40 mM N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-
N#-2-ethanesulfonic acid, 0.1 M KCl, 0.5 mM EDTA and 0.2 mg/ml bovine
serum albumin, pH 8) three times for 5 min each at 4°C. Per treatment, one
slide was then incubated with enzyme buffer alone, one with endonuclease III
(EndoIII) in buffer and one with formamidopyrimidine (FPG) in buffer for 30
min at 37°C. EndoIII recognizes oxidized pyrimidines and FPG recognizes
altered purines, creating additional DNA strand breaks at these sites.

Subsequently, the DNA was allowed to unwind in electrophoresis solution
(0.3 M NaOH and 1 mM Na2EDTA, pH 13) for 40 min at 4°C before electro-
phoresis at 0.9 V/cm, 300 mA for 30 min at 4°C. Slides were neutralized in
phosphate-buffered saline and rinsed in ultrapure water for 10 min each at 4°C
and left to dry overnight at room temperature.

Gels were stained with 4#,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole and viewed by ﬂuo-
rescence microscopy. Comets were classiﬁed with visual scoring (21); 100
randomly selected comets were classiﬁed into ﬁve classes (0–4) according to
the extent of tail DNA to give an overall score of between 0 and 400 arbitrary
units per treatment.

Statistical analysis
Faecal nitrite values and transit times were 10log transformed to normalize the
distribution and are presented as geometric means and antilogged 95% conﬁ-
dence intervals (CIs). Other results are presented as mean ± SE. Meat versus
VEG results were compared within each study using a paired Student’s t-test
(two tailed). Statistical differences between PM and RM diets (between stud-
ies) were analysed by analysis of covariance with type of meat (PM or RM) as
independent variable and gender as dichotomous covariate to adjust for differ-
ences in male to female ratios between the two studies. Where PM and RM
results are compared (between studies), results are presented as adjusted mean
± SE. Where meat and VEG results are compared (within studies), results are
presented as unadjusted means.

Associations between continuous variables were tested using Pearson’s cor-
relation coefﬁcient (r). P ,0.05 was considered statistically signiﬁcant. SPSS
16 for Macintosh (SPSS, Chicago, IL, 2008) was used for the analysis.

Results

Dietary NOC and haem
Only male diets were analysed as they contained the largest amount of
meat. PM diets contained 58 ± 15 mmol/d total NOC, composed of 24
± 8 mmol/d RSNO, 20 ± 6 mmol/d FeNO and 14 ± 2 mmol/d other
NOC and 17 ± 10 lmol/d nitrite. The NOC composition of the pro-
cessed meats, i.e. bacon, corned beef, gammon and pork luncheon
meat, is shown in Table I. RM and VEG diets contained negligible
amounts of NOC and nitrite.

PM diets contained similar amounts of haem (86 mmol/d) to RM diets

(110 mmol/d). The haem content of the VEG diets was negligible.

Faecal NOC and haem
Faecal levels of NOC on VEG diets were very low but increased
signiﬁcantly on both PM and RM diets (Table II). There was no
statistically signiﬁcant difference in total NOC concentrations on
the PM and RM diets (adjusted means PM 175 ± 19 nmol/g versus
RM 185 ± 22 nmol/g; P 5 0.75). FeNO was the main contributor to
total NOC on both meat diets although the RM diet resulted in a larger
proportion of FeNO (adjusted means RM 78% versus PM 54%;
P , 0.0001) and less RSNO (adjusted means RM 12% versus PM
19%; P , 0.01) and other NOC (adjusted means RM 10% versus PM
27%; P , 0.0001) compared with PM. Similar results were obtained
when absolute concentrations were used.
NOC concentrations in FW used in the comet assay were 1.7% of
the concentration in homogenates before correction for dilution (PM
0.65 nmol/g and RM 0.41 nmol/g).

There was no statistically signiﬁcant difference between adjusted
mean faecal nitrite concentrations on the PM diet (19 nmol/g, 95% CI
11–35) and those on the RM diet (28 nmol/g, 95% CI 14–56,
P 5 0.41). Concentrations on both meat diets were signiﬁcantly high-
er than after VEG diets (3 nmol/g, 95% CI 2–6, P , 0.0001). There
was no statistically signiﬁcant correlation between concentrations of
faecal nitrite and total NOC.

Faecal haem was signiﬁcantly higher when the meat diets were con-
sumed as compared with the VEG diets (P , 0.0001, Table II) although
to a lesser extent on the PM diet compared with the RM diet (adjusted
means PM 326 ± 69 nmol/g versus RM 1033 ± 84 nmol/g, n 5 11;
P , 0.0001). Haem concentrations were positively related with FeNO
concentrations on the RM diet (r 5 0.63, P , 0.05; n 5 11) and mar-
ginally on the PM diet (r 5 0.45, P 5 0.08). Haem concentrations
were positively related to RSNO on the RM diet (r 5 0.64, P , 0.05;
n 5 11) but not on the PM diet (r 5 0.15, P 5 0.58).

FW genotoxicity with the comet assay
There was no statistically signiﬁcant difference in DNA breaks induced
in Caco2 cells by FW from both PM and RM diets (adjusted means PM
167 ± 12 versus RM 163 ± 13; P 5 0.80). However, PM resulted in
higher levels of EndoIII-sensitive sites (adjusted means PM 24 ± 5
versus RM 9 ± 5; P , 0.05) and a larger variation in FPG-sensitive
sites compared with RM (Figure 1A). Surprisingly, FW from both di-
etary studies induced signiﬁcantly more DNA strand breaks on the
VEG diets compared with the meat diets (P , 0.05; Table III).

In the comet assay, FPG detects oxidatively damaged purines but
also seems to have a high sensitivity towards N-7 alkylation of
guanine (ring opened) (22). There was no statistically signiﬁcant
correlation between FPG-sensitive sites and NOC concentrations
in faecal homogenates on both meat diets, but NOC concentrations
in FW—despite being relatively low—trended towards a positive
association with FPG-sensitive sites on the PM (r 5 0.55, P 5 0.06;
n 5 12, three samples not analysed, one sample with no peak in
assay) but not on the RM diet (r 5 0.25, P 5 0.49; n 5 10, two
samples no peak in assay) (Figure 1A). There were no signiﬁcant
associations with DNA strand breaks and EndoIII-sensitive sites
(Figure 1B). No NOC could be detected in FW on the VEG diets.
Nitrite concentrations in FW were 18% of those in faecal homo-
genates (PM study only, RM not analysed); there were no statisti-
cally signiﬁcant associations with DNA strand breaks or enzyme-
sensitive sites.

Mean transit time
Mean transit time (MTT) on the PM diet (adjusted geometric mean 44
h, 95% CI 35–55; n 5 15) was signiﬁcantly lower than on the RM diet
(adjusted geometric mean 70 h, 95% CI 55–90; P , 0.01). MTT
during both VEG periods were similar (VEG in PM study 44 h,
95% CI 35–55; n 5 15 versus VEG in RM study 55 h, 95% CI
43–70; P 5 0.18) and not signiﬁcantly different from their respective
meat periods (PM study P 5 0.80 and RM study P 5 0.07).

MTT was positively related with total NOC concentrations (r 5
0.63, P 5 0.01; n 5 15), FeNO (r 5 0.60, P 5 0.02; n 5 15) and
other NOC (r 5 0.74, P , 0.01; n 5 15) but not with RSNO
(r 5 0.13, P 5 0.64; n 5 15) on the PM diet. In contrast, there were
no statistically signiﬁcant correlations between MTT and NOC con-
centrations on the RM diet (P . 0.25).

Daily faecal weight, calculated as the mean faecal weight over
the last 4 days of the diet, was signiﬁcantly higher on the VEG
diet compared with the meat diet in both studies (PM 167.5 ± 11.9
g/d versus VEG 223.8 ± 24.1 g/d; P , 0.05 and RM 148.1 ± 19.5
g/d versus VEG 308.3 ± 41.4 g/d; P , 0.0001). There were no sta-
tistically signiﬁcant differences between studies (P . 0.12). Daily
faecal weight was not statistically signiﬁcantly associated with
MTT on any of the diets or for both studies in total (P . 0.09).

Discussion

Recently, we implicated haem as a facilitator of the endogenous for-
mation of NOC from dietary nitrite or nitrate and nitrite from

Effect of processed and RM on endogenous nitrosation and DNA damage

faeces by Mirvish et al. (24), which were deﬁned as NOC that were
formed after in vitro nitrosation of faecal supernatant.

The endogenous formation of NOC is likely to begin with the
formation of RSNO in the stomach, as acidic conditions facilitate
the formation of these compounds (11). These compounds can then
promote the formation of other NOC, in particular nitrosyl haem, in
the anaerobic and reducing environment of the gastrointestinal tract.
Considering the importance of NOC production along the gastroin-
testinal tract, the association between MTT and faecal NOC concen-
trations was investigated in the meat diets. The statistically signiﬁcant
association between MTT and faecal NOC concentrations on the PM
diet—in particular for FeNO compounds–supports the hypothesis that
these compounds are formed in the anaerobic conditions of the small
and large intestines. However, the lack of association following the
RM diet with a signiﬁcantly longer transit times suggests a threshold
effect.

The alkaline comet assay detects DNA strand breaks and alkali-
labile sites, i.e. apurinic or apyrimidinic sites or baseless sugars.
These can result from a variety of damage and might also represent
intermediates in the repair process. Including DNA glycosylase en-
zymes results in excision of oxidatively damaged nucleobases from
the DNA strand, which leaves additional strand breaks (21). Despite
the different composition of faecal NOC on PM and RM diets, there
was no clear effect on FW-induced DNA strand breaks, but
PM resulted in signiﬁcantly more FW-induced EndoIII-sensitive
sites. However, due to the very low concentrations of total NOC in
the FW, we were not able to analyse NOC composition and hence
cannot relate NOC composition of the FW and the faecal homoge-
nates. We have currently no explanation for the unexpected higher
level of DNA strand breaks on the VEG diets as compared with the
high meat diets, which is intriguing given a recent study showing
a higher colorectal cancer incidence in vegetarians than in meat
eaters (25). Nevertheless, further studies are underway exchanging
red or PM with white meat or ﬁsh to eliminate possible interfering
plant constituents, e.g. polyphenols. Dietary analysis of total phe-
nols using the Folin–Ciolcalteu method showed similar levels of
phenols in our meat and VEG study diets (data not shown), but this
test does not distinguish between different kinds of polyphenolic
compounds. However, we have not been able as yet to obtain reliable
estimates for FW levels with this method.

The aqueous fraction of faeces, prepared by either direct ultracen-
trifugation, dilution in phosphate-buffered saline or ultrapure water or
reconstitution of freeze-dried faeces, has been shown to be genotoxic
in several colonic cell lines (26–30). Previous studies, the most recent
ones using nuclear magnetic resonance proﬁling, have identiﬁed
a number of compounds in FW including short chain fatty acids,
organic acids, phenolic compounds and amino acids. Inter- and intra-
individual differences are related to variation in concentrations rather
than composition, which in turn seem to be related to diet (31,32).
However, still little is known about the nature of FW, which may
explain inconsistent results when investigating the effect of diet on
DNA damage using the comet assay (26,27,29).

Colonic cells have been shown to be susceptible to NOC-induced
damage. Potassium diazoacetate, a stable nitrosated derivative
of glycine, shows a dose–response effect on genotoxicity in
Caco2 cells, human lymphocytes and rat colonocytes (33) and N-
nitrosomorpholine causes a dose-dependent increase in DNA strand
breaks in Caco2 cells, all of which originated from alkali-labile
sites (34). No oxidative damage was observed, although pretreat-
ment with vitamins E and C reduced the formation of strand breaks
(34). Our results showed the presence of altered purines and pyr-
imidines induced by FW, with higher levels of oxidized pyrimidines
on the PM diet compared with the RM diet. Despite the NOC levels
in FW being very low compared with the faecal homogenates, they
tended to be positively related to altered purines on the PM diet
indicating that they are related to oxidative damage.

Nitrite intake from PM was 0.8 mg/d (17 lmol/d) in our study.

inducible and endogenous nitric oxide synthases (9,11,23). Similar to
our previous studies, faecal NOC levels were low (3–4 nmol/g) on
diets containing no meat and a negligible amount of haem. On nitrite-
preserved (PM) and fresh RM diets containing similar amounts of
haem (86–110 mmol/d), faecal NOC levels increase signiﬁcantly to
180 nmol/g.

Dietary NOC in the PM diet (58 mmol/d) was in the same order of
magnitude or greater as excretion, whereas NOC content of the RM
diet was negligible but resulted in similar levels of excretion in faeces
as on the PM diet (adjusted means PM 28.4 ± 2.6 mmol/d and RM
22.0 ± 3.0 mmol/d). However, on a RM diet, faecal FeNO represent
a greater proportion of total NOC compared with the PM diet and
concentrations are positively associated with haem concentrations. In
addition, on both meat diets, concentrations of FeNO were signiﬁ-
cantly higher than those of RSNO, which conﬁrms the important
contribution of haem to endogenous NOC production (9).

Mirvish et al. (24) studied mice fed hot dogs with or without
NaNO2 and concluded that faecal NOC excretion represents mainly
excretion of ingested NOC and of NOC formed by nitrosation of
precursor NOC by nitrite. In contrast, our results suggest that faecal
NOC are unlikely to be simply derived from the diet and are mainly
formed endogenously. However, the preformed NOC present in our
study diets are not to be confused with the precursor NOC analysed in

was 0.1–3.3 mg/d for women and 0.8–5.4 mg/d for men (adjusted for
energy intake, age, weekday and season), which would be somehow
lower when nitrite alone is calculated (15). The link between dietary
nitrite and cancers of the gastrointestinal
is inconclusive
(35,36), which may be because most nitrite is absorbed early
and the majority does not reach the colon (37). There was no asso-
ciation between FW nitrite and FW-induced DNA damage on our
PM diet.

tract

In conclusion, meats cured with nitrite have the same effect as
fresh RM on endogenous nitrosation but show increased FW-induced
oxidative DNA damage, which could be a result of pro-oxidative
compounds derived from both dietary factors or endogenous
immune response. The higher level of DNA strand breaks on the
VEG diets is an intriguing ﬁnding that needs to be clariﬁed in further
studies.
