ABSTRACT
Background: Epidemiologic evidence for the relation between car-
bohydrate quality and risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D) has been mixed.
Objective: We prospectively examined the association of dietary
glycemic index (GI) and glycemic load (GL) with T2D risk.
Design: We prospectively followed 74,248 women from the Nurses’
Health Study (1984–2008), 90,411 women from the Nurses’ Health Study
II (1991–2009), and 40,498 men from the Health Professionals Follow-
Up Study (1986–2008) who were free of diabetes, cardiovascular dis-
ease, and cancer at baseline. Diet was assessed by using a validated
questionnaire and updated every 4 y. We also conducted an updated
meta-analysis, including results from our 3 cohorts and other studies.
Results: During 3,800,618 person-years of follow-up, we docu-
mented 15,027 cases of incident T2D. In pooled multivariable anal-
yses, those in the highest quintile of energy-adjusted GI had a 33%
higher risk (95% CI: 26%, 41%) of T2D than those in the lowest
quintile. Participants in the highest quintile of energy-adjusted GL
had a 10% higher risk (95% CI: 2%, 18%) of T2D. Participants who
consumed a combination diet that was high in GI or GL and low in
cereal ﬁber had an w50% higher risk of T2D. In the updated meta-
analysis, the summary RRs (95% CIs) comparing the highest with
the lowest categories of GI and GL were 1.19 (1.14, 1.24) and 1.13
(1.08, 1.17), respectively.
Conclusion: The updated analyses from our 3 cohorts and meta-
analyses provide further evidence that higher dietary GI and GL

are associated with increased risk of T2D.

INTRODUCTION

Type 2 diabetes (T2D)4 has remained a signiﬁcant public
health problem for several decades. The number of adults with
diabetes worldwide increased from 153 million in the year 1980
to 347 million in 2008 (1). The WHO projects diabetes to be the
seventh leading cause of death in 2030 (2). Furthermore, the
total costs of diagnosed diabetes have increased by 41% from
$174 billion in 2007 to $245 billion in 2012 in the United States
(3). Well-designed randomized controlled trials such as the Di-
abetes Prevention Program (4, 5) have shown that following
a healthy dietary pattern along with lifestyle modiﬁcations are as
effective as or even better than pharmacologic interventions in
preventing T2D. Carbohydrates are the dietary components that
have the greatest effect on blood glucose concentrations. Because
carbohydrates differ in their ability to increase blood glucose, the

concept of glycemic index (GI) was introduced in the early 1980s.
The GI is a ranking of carbohydrates according to their effect on
postprandial glycemia (6). Although the GI can effectively rank
foods on the basis of their blood glucose response, it does not
account for the amount of carbohydrate in a typical serving. The
glycemic load (GL) was therefore developed as the product of the
GI and the amount of carbohydrate in a serving.

Despite the existence of these 2 indexes for many years, the
role of GI and GL in preventing T2D remains controversial.
Although 3 meta-analyses (7–9) of prospective cohort studies
found a higher risk of T2D with higher GI and GL, a more re-
cent meta-analysis of 8 European countries found no association
with T2D (10). Furthermore, the most recent American Diabetes
Association’s nutrition recommendations for management of
adults with T2D indicated that, to date, supportive evidence for
a role of GI and GL in glycemic control has only been from poorly
controlled or uncontrolled studies or observational studies with a
high potential for bias (11).

Given the inconsistencies in the literature, the aims of the
current study were as follows: 1) to update our previous analyses
of GI and GL and T2D risk using much longer follow-up in the 3
Harvard cohorts [Nurses’ Health Study (NHS), NHS II, and the
Health Professionals Follow-Up Study (HPFS)] and 2) to conduct
an updated meta-analysis of the previous literature including re-
sults from our 3 cohorts.

METHODS

Study population

The NHS began in the early 1970s as a long-term prospec-
tive investigation of the health effects of various contraceptive
methods of 121,701 married female nurses, aged 30–55 y, from
11 US states. The NHS II is a prospective cohort study in 116,
671 younger female nurses, aged 25–42 y, that began in 1989.
The HPFS began in 1986 as a prospective cohort study to
evaluate the association of nutritional factors and the incidence
of several chronic diseases in a group of 51, 529 male health
professionals. In all 3 cohorts, participants are followed biennially
through validated questionnaires that obtain updated information
on their medical history,
lifestyle factors, and occurrence of
chronic diseases. For the current study, we used baseline as 1984
in NHS, 1986 in HPFS, and 1991 in NHS II when detailed in-
formation on diet was ﬁrst collected. We excluded participants
with a baseline history of diabetes (including type 1 diabetes and
T2D), cardiovascular disease, or cancer because these diagnoses
may result in changes in diet (12). We also excluded women who
left $10 items blank on the food-frequency questionnaire (FFQ)
or who had implausible energy intakes (,800 or .4200 kcal/d for
men and ,500 or .3500 kcal/d for women). Men who left $70
items blank on the FFQ were also excluded. The ﬁnal analytic
sample included 74,248 women from the NHS, 90,411 women
from the NHS II, and 40,498 men from the HPFS with complete
information. The study was approved by the Human Research
Committee of Brigham and Women’s Hospital and the Harvard
School of Public Health in Boston.

Ascertainment of exposure

With the use of a 126-item semiquantitative FFQ, diet was ﬁrst
assessed in 1984 in NHS and in 1986 in HPFS. By using a 133-
item semiquantitative FFQ, diet was ﬁrst assessed in NHS II in
1991. In all 3 cohorts, subsequent FFQs were administered every
4 y to update dietary information. In all FFQs, participants were
asked how often, on average (never to $6 times/d), during the
previous year they had consumed a commonly used unit or
portion size of foods and beverages. The FFQs were reviewed
every 4 y with the use of extensive pilot studies and analyses of
open-ended sections to determine whether changes were needed.
Nutrient intakes were computed by multiplying the frequency of
consumption of each food or beverage by the nutrient content of
the speciﬁed portion and summing the contributions from all
items. Nutrient intakes were obtained by using the USDA food-
composition database supplemented with information from
manufacturers and information from our own analyses of foods.
The GI values for single food items on the FFQ were derived
from available databases and publications (6, 13, 14). Certain
foods not represented in the database were sent to the University
of Sydney for GI analysis. These foods included breakfast ce-
reals, cakes, cookies, mufﬁn mixes, pancake mixes, and candy
bars. For the remaining foods not represented in the database,
we imputed their GI values from similar foods in the database.
For each participant, we calculated the average dietary GI by
summing the products of the carbohydrate content per serving
for each food item times the average number of servings of that
food per day, times its GI, and divided by the total daily car-
bohydrate content (15). Because the amount of carbohydrate in

an overall diet can vary, we derived a global dietary GL score by
multiplying the amount of carbohydrates in the diet by the av-
erage GI. GL is an indicator of insulin demand or glucose re-
sponse induced by total carbohydrate intake (15). GI, GL, and
intakes of all nutrients were energy-adjusted by using the residual
method (16).

The validity and reliability of the FFQs have been described
elsewhere (17–22). In a validation study conducted in a subsample
of 173 NHS participants, FFQ assessments of total carbohydrate
and dietary ﬁber were highly correlated with diet record assess-
ments (total carbohydrate, r = 0.64; ﬁber, r = 0.56) (17, 22). Similar
correlation coefﬁcients were seen in a validation study in a sub-
sample of 40- to 74-y-old HPFS participants (total carbohydrate,
r = 0.73; ﬁber, r = 0.68) (19).

Ascertainment of diabetes

The primary endpoint for this study was incident T2D. Par-
ticipants who reported a diagnosis of T2D on the biennial main
questionnaire were mailed a supplementary questionnaire with
regard to symptoms, diagnostic tests, and hypoglycemic therapy.
In accordance with the National Diabetes Data Group criteria
(23), a case of T2D was conﬁrmed if at least one of the following
was reported on the supplementary questionnaire: 1) one or more
classic symptoms (excessive thirst, polyuria, weight loss, hunger)
and fasting plasma glucose concentrations of $11.1 mmol/L,
2) $2 elevated plasma glucose concentrations on different occa-
sions (fasting concentrations of $7.8 mmol/L, random plasma
glucose concentrations of $11.1 mmol/L, and/or concentrations
of $11.1 mmol/L after $2 h shown by an oral-glucose-tolerance
test) in the absence of symptoms, or 3) treatment with hypogly-
cemic medication (insulin or oral hypoglycemic agent). For cases
identiﬁed after 1998, we applied the American Diabetes Associ-
ation criteria (24) in which the threshold for diagnosis of diabetes
changed from a fasting plasma glucose concentration of 7.8 to 7.0
mmol/L. The current analysis includes only the cases conﬁrmed
by the supplementary questionnaire.

The validity of the supplementary questionnaire was estab-
lished in 2 previous studies through medical record reviews. In
both studies, diagnosis of T2D was conﬁrmed in .97% of the
cases (25, 26).

Assessment of covariates

In the biennial follow-up questionnaires, we updated infor-
mation on a participant’s age, weight, smoking status, physical
activity, menopausal status and use of postmenopausal hormone
therapy (for women), oral contraceptive use (for women), and
personal history of chronic diseases. Height was ascertained on
the 1976 enrollment questionnaire in the NHS and the 1986
enrollment questionnaire in the HPFS. We calculated BMI as
weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared. Self-
reports of body weight have been shown to be highly correlated
with measured weights (r = 0.96) in the NHS and HPFS (27).
The presence or absence of a family history of diabetes (in ﬁrst-
degree relatives) was assessed in 1982 and 1988 in the NHS; in
1989, 1997, 2001, and 2005 in the NHS II; and in 1987 in the
HPFS. Information on intakes of alcohol and other beverages
was updated every 4 y by using the FFQ.

Statistical analysis

We calculated each individual’s person-time from the return
of the baseline questionnaire (1984 in NHS, 1991 in NHS II, and
1986 in HPFS) to the date of diagnosis of T2D, death, date of
loss to follow-up, or the cutoff date (30 June 2008 in NHS, 30
June 2009 in NHS II, and 1 January 2008 in HPFS), whichever
occurred ﬁrst. We used Cox proportional hazards regression
models to examine the association between quintiles of GI and
GL and risk of T2D. The regression models included age in years
as the time scale, stratiﬁed by calendar time in 2-y intervals, and
allowed for possible interaction between calendar time and age
in the baseline hazards to be accounted for nonparametrically
(model 1). Our ﬁrst multivariable model (model 2) adjusted
for race (white or nonwhite) and several lifestyle factors,
including family history of diabetes (yes or no), menopausal
status, and postmenopausal hormone use (women only; pre-
menopausal, postmenopausal with no history of hormone re-
placement, or postmenopausal with current hormone replacement),
oral contraceptive use (women only; never user, past user, or
current user), physical activity (,3.0, 3.0–8.9, 9.0–17.9, 18.0–
26.9, or $27.0 metabolic equivalents/wk), BMI (in kg/m2; ,21,
21–22.9, 23–24.9, 25–26.9, 27–29.9, 30–32.9, 33–34.9, 35–39.9,
or $40), smoking status (never; past; current: 1–14, 14–25, or
$25 cigarettes/d), and total energy intake (quintiles). In model
3, we further adjusted for intakes of total coffee, energy-adjusted
intakes of cereal ﬁber, trans fatty acids, PUFAs, SFAs, and MUFAs
(quintiles). For models with GI as the exposure, we additionally
adjusted for total protein intake (quintiles, model 4).

For each 2-y time period, we updated information on all
nondietary covariates to account for changes in risk factors over
time. For dietary measures, we used the cumulative average of
food intakes from baseline to the censoring events to best rep-
resent long-term diet and minimize within-person variation (12).

However, we stopped updating dietary variables on a report of
cancer or cardiovascular disease because changes in diet after
development of these conditions may confound the relation between
diet and diabetes (12, 28).We performed several sensitivity analyses
to test the robustness of our results. First, we tested associations by
using baseline diet alone. Second, to test if our results were biased
by selectively stopping updating diet after an intermediate outcome,
we continuously updated diet until the end of follow-up. Third,
we excluded incident cases of cardiovascular disease or cancer
during follow-up from the analysis. Finally, instead of using re-
peated measures of diet, we used the most recent measure of diet or
the intake reported at the beginning of each FFQ cycle.

The proportional hazards assumption was tested by including
an interaction term between the main exposures and months to
events (P . 0.05 for all tests). We tested for potential effect
modiﬁcation by BMI, family history of diabetes, and physical
activity by including cross-product terms with the exposure vari-
ables in our fully adjusted model. Tests for linear trend were con-
ducted by assigning the median value to each quintile or category
and treating this as a continuous variable in the regression model. To
evaluate potential joint effects of cereal ﬁber and BMI with GI and
GL, we cross-classiﬁed participants into categories of BMI (,25,
25–29.9, or $30) and tertiles of cereal ﬁber, GI, and GL.

Because of differences in sex, follow-up time, and question-
naires in the 3 cohorts, all analyses were performed separately in
each cohort to achieve better control of confounding. For the
primary analyses, to obtain overall estimates for both sexes and
to increase statistical power, the RRs from the multivariable-
adjusted models from the 3 cohorts were combined with the use
of an inverse variance–weighted meta-analysis by the ﬁxed-effects
model (29). The cohort analyses were not prespeciﬁed at the time
of cohort initiation. All statistical tests were 2-sided and per-
formed by using SAS version 9.2 for UNIX (SAS Institute).

Updated meta-analysis on GI, GL, and incident T2D

We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic
Reviews and Meta-Analyses protocol to conduct an updated
systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective studies
assessing the association between GI, GL, and risk of developing
T2D in adults. We performed a systematic search of MEDLINE
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed) and EMBASE (www.
embase.com) (until August 2013) and a manual search of bib-
liographies of key retrieved articles and relevant reviews. To be
included in the meta-analysis, studies had to fulﬁll the following
criteria: 1) be prospective in design, 2) have T2D as an endpoint
(self-reported or clinically assessed), 3) provide assessment
method for GI and GL, 4) present RRs and the corresponding
variance estimates, and 5) describe the adjustment for potential
confounders. Detailed information on search criteria is presented
as Supplemental Material under “Supplemental data” in the
online issue. One author (SNB) deﬁned the study criteria, as-
sessed study eligibility, extracted the data, and assessed study
quality by using the Newcastle-Ottawa quality scale. A second
author (DKT) independently double-checked the extracted data.
Discrepancies were resolved by mutual consultation. The fol-
lowing data items were extracted: author, year of publication,
journal, cohort name, country, comorbidities excluded at base-
line, percentage of population as male, mean age, mean BMI,
length of follow-up, mean GI and GL, dietary instrument,
number of dietary assessments, number of T2D cases, method
of ascertainment of outcome, and covariates adjusted for in
Cox models. The RRs were used as the common measure of
association across studies. We considered HRs and ORs to be
equivalent to RRs. Because random-effects meta-analysis tends
to give disproportionally more weight to small, statistically less
robust studies (30), we used a ﬁxed-effects model to compute the
summary RR of T2D for the highest category of GI or GL

compared with the lowest category. However, we also provided
summary RRs with the use of random-effects models. For one
study (31) that analyzed GI as a continuous variable, we esti-
mated the RR for the highest compared with lowest categories of
exposures by determining the difference in GI between the
highest and lowest categories and scaling the risk estimates ac-
cordingly. For another study that provided estimates per 10-unit
increases in GI (32) and stated that these approximated the dif-
ference between the 87.5th and the 12.5th percentiles, we used
the published estimates for comparing the highest with the lowest
quartiles. In sensitivity analyses, we examined if the summary
RR for the highest compared with lowest categories of GI
changed appreciably with the inclusion of these 2 studies. Forest
plots were produced to visually assess the RRs and their cor-
responding 95% CIs across studies. Heterogeneity in the asso-
ciation of the main exposures with T2D risk was assessed by
using the I2
values of w25%, 50%, and 75% were
considered to indicate low, moderate, and high heterogeneity,
respectively. When heterogeneity was considered to be present,
we conducted univariate meta-regressions by using study-level
data to explore potential sources of heterogeneity. Study quality
(Newcastle-Ottawa quality scale), use of a validated dietary in-
strument, follow-up time, number of dietary assessments (baseline
compared with repeated measures), and type of assessment of T2D
(self-reported or conﬁrmed by medical review) were examined as
potential modiﬁers when heterogeneity was present. We also ex-
amined the inﬂuence of each study on the overall estimate by
systematically removing one study at a time and examining the
inﬂuence on the overall risk estimate and the 95% CI. We assessed
the possibility of publication bias by using the Begg’s test and
Egger’s test and a visual inspection of funnel plots (33, 34). The
meta-analysis was performed with the use of the STATA statistical
program, version 9.2 (StataCorp).

RESULTS

Cohort analyses

During 3,800,618 person-years of follow-up, we documented
15,027 cases of T2D. The distribution of age-adjusted baseline
characteristics according to quintiles of energy-adjusted GI is
shown in Table 1. In all 3 cohorts, compared with those who
consumed diets with the lowest GI, those in the highest category
of GI were younger, less physically active, consumed a higher
GL diet, and had lower intakes of alcohol, magnesium, total
protein, and total coffee. At the same time, they also had higher
intakes of cereal ﬁber and trans fatty acids. The distribution of
baseline characteristics according to quintiles of energy-adjusted
GL is shown in Table 2. Like their GI counterparts, those in the
highest quintile of GL had lower intakes of alcohol, protein, and
total coffee compared with those with the lowest GL diets. They
also consumed a high-GI diet and had higher intakes of cereal ﬁber.
Higher GI was associated with a progressively higher risk of
T2D (Table 3). In the pooled analysis of estimates from the 3
studies that used ﬁxed-effects models, in age- and lifestyle-adjusted

models (model 2) the RRs (95% CIs) across quintiles 1–5 were
1.00, 1.10 (1.04, 1.16), 1.09 (1.04, 1.15), 1.18 (1.12, 1.24), and
1.28 (1.21, 1.35) (P-trend , 0.0001). Further adjustment for
intakes of total coffee, cereal ﬁber, and different kinds of fatty
acids did not materially change this observation. However, ad-
ditional adjustment for total dietary protein intake strengthened
this association. Participants in the highest quintile of GI had
a 33% higher risk (95% CI: 26%, 41%) compared with those
in the lowest quintile. The RRs (95% CIs) across quintiles of
energy-adjusted GL are shown in Table 4. Those in the highest
quintile of GL had a higher risk of T2D, but this association was
only signiﬁcant in the NHS. However, in pooled analysis, com-
pared with those with the lowest GL diet, those in the highest
quintile of energy-adjusted GL had a 10% higher risk (95% CI:
2%, 18%) for T2D after adjustment for age, lifestyle, and dietary
factors (model 3). Further adjustment for total protein intake
strengthened the associations, and risk estimates were similar to
those of GI. The RRs (95% CIs) across quintiles 1–5 were 1.00,
1.09 (1.03, 1.15), 1.09 (1.02, 1.17), 1.21 (1.12, 1.32), and 1.36
(1.23, 1.50) (P-trend , 0.0001).

Median values of glycemic load for each category were used to test for a linear trend across categories. Model 1 adjusted for age (y); model 2 adjusted as for
model 1 + race (white or nonwhite), smoking (never; past; current: 1–14, 15–24, or .24 cigarettes/d), alcohol intake (0, 0.1–4.9, 5–9.9, 10–14.9, or $15 g/d),
postmenopausal hormone use (women only; premenopausal, postmenopausal current user, or postmenopausal never/past user), oral contraceptive use (women
only; never, past, or current), physical activity (,3, 3–8.9, 9–17.9, 18–26.9, or $27 metabolic equivalent task hours/wk), family history of diabetes (yes or
no), BMI (in kg/m2; ,21, 21–22.9, 23–24.9, 25–26.9, 27–29.9, 30–34.9, 35–39.9, or $40), and total energy intake (quintiles); model 3 adjusted as for model
2 + intakes of total coffee (quintiles), energy-adjusted cereal ﬁber (quintiles), energy-adjusted PUFAs (quintiles), energy-adjusted trans fatty acids (quintiles),
and SFAs (quintiles). All statistical tests were conducted by using Cox proportional hazards regression models.

Results were combined with the use of a ﬁxed-effects model.

We examined the joint effects of GI and GL with cereal ﬁber by
cross-classifying participants by both variables (Figure 1, A and
B). The pooled RR for the combination of a high GI and a low
cereal ﬁber intake compared with the opposite extreme was 1.59
(95% CI: 1.47, 1.73; P-interaction . 0.20 in all 3 cohorts).
Similarly, those with a high-GL and a low-cereal-ﬁber diet had
a 1.47-fold risk (95% CI: 1.32, 1.63) compared with those with
a low-GL and a high-cereal-ﬁber diet (P-interaction . 0.10 in
all 3 cohorts). We also evaluated the joint effects of GI and GL
with BMI on the risk of T2D. Compared with those who were
normal weight and had low-GI or -GL diets, obese participants
with high-GI (RR: 12.28; 95% CI: 11.09, 13.60; P-interaction .
0.05) or high-GL (RR: 10.80; 95% CI: 9.63, 12.11; P-interaction
. 0.05) diets had a .10-fold higher risk of T2D.

Our results remained robust in several sensitivity analyses (see
Supplemental Tables S1 and S2 under “Supplemental data” in
the online issue). When we used baseline diet alone to examine
associations between GI, GL, and T2D, risk estimates were
largely attenuated. In fully adjusted pooled models, those in the
highest quintile of GI and GL had RRs of 1.26 (95% CI: 1.19,
1.33) and 1.02 (95% CI: 0.94, 1.09) for T2D compared with
those in quintile 1. Results remained largely unchanged when
we continuously updated diet until the end of follow-up (RR for
quintile 5 compared with quintile 1 for GI: 1.33; 95% CI: 1.25,

1.41; RR for quintile 5 compared with quintile 1 for GL: 1.09;
95% CI: 1.01, 1.18) when we used the most recent diet as our
primary exposure (RR for quintile 5 compared with quintile 1
for GI: 1.31; 95% CI: 1.24, 1.39; RR for quintile 5 compared
with quintile 1 for GL: 1.12; 95% CI: 1.04, 1.21) or if we
censored cases of cardiovascular disease or cancer that occurred
during follow-up (RR for quintile 5 compared with quintile 1 for
GI: 1.34; 95% CI: 1.26, 1.43; RR for quintile 5 compared with
quintile 1 for GL: 1.07; 95% CI: 0.99, 1.16). Associations re-
mained unchanged among nonsmokers and after excluding those
with very low body weights (see Supplemental Table S3 under
“Supplemental data” in the online issue). Results remained un-
changed when we excluded participants with gestational di-
abetes at baseline (data not shown).

Meta-analysis

We further conducted an updated meta-analysis that included
updated results from our 3 cohorts together with those of previous
published studies. Our search on MEDLINE and EMBASE
identiﬁed a total of 2424 citations. After the ﬁrst
level of
screening based on titles and abstracts with the aforementioned
criteria, 70 articles remained for further evaluation. After ex-
amining these articles in more detail, 56 articles were excluded

Detailed characteristics of the studies (not including our co-
horts) included in our meta-analysis are shown in Table 5. The
association between GI and GL and T2D risk was the primary
outcome in all but one study (45). Six studies were conducted in
the United States, 4 in Europe, 1 each in the United Kingdom,
Japan, and China. The number of incident T2D cases in the
studies ranged from 99 to 11,559. Seven studies enrolled both
sexes; 2 included only men, whereas 3 studies included only
women. All studies assessed diet by using an FFQ. The median
length of follow-up ranged from 4 to 14 y. Diabetes ascertain-
ment was based on medical conﬁrmation in all but 4 studies.
Study quality scores based on the Newcastle-Ottawa scale were
all .6.

Those in the highest categories of GI and GL had a signiﬁ-
cantly higher risk of T2D (Figures 2 and 3). The RRs (95% CIs)
from the ﬁxed-effects model comparing the highest categories of
GI or GL with their corresponding lowest categories were 1.19
(1.14, 1.24) and 1.13 (1.08, 1.17), respectively. However, we
found evidence of moderate heterogeneity among studies in-
cluded in the meta-analysis of GI and T2D (I2 = 68.5%, P ,
0.001; Figure 3). When we used a random-effects model to
address the issue of heterogeneity, the summary risk estimate for
the association of GI with T2D was attenuated but remained
signiﬁcant (RR: 1.12; 95% CI: 1.03, 1.21; Supplemental Figure
S2 under “Supplemental data” in the online issue). On the other
hand, the summary risk estimate comparing the highest with the
lowest category of GL and T2D from our random-effects model
was similar to that of our ﬁxed-effects model (RR: 1.12; 95%
CI: 1.06, 1.17; Supplemental Figure S3 under “Supplemental
data” in the online issue).

We documented signiﬁcant publication bias for the association
between GI and risk of T2D (see Supplemental Figure S4A under
“Supplemental data” in the online issue). However, no publi-
cation bias was detected for the association between GL and
T2D (see Supplemental Figure S4B under “Supplemental data”
in the online issue). We found that the number of dietary as-
sessments (baseline compared with repeated), length of follow-
up, and type of T2D assessments (self-report compared with
medical conﬁrmation) were signiﬁcant sources of heterogeneity
(see Supplemental Table S4 under “Supplemental data” in the
online issue). However, given the limited power and the small
number of studies, when analyses were stratiﬁed by these vari-
ables, heterogeneity remained in the various subgroups (data not
shown). Therefore, results are presented with all groups com-
bined. When we systematically removed one study at a time,
excluding any single study did not change the risk estimate or
the 95% CIs to include the null value of one, suggesting that no
single study markedly affected the overall conclusion. In sen-
sitivity analyses, when we included scaled estimates for the 2
studies that reported results that used GI as a continuous ex-
posure, the summary RR for the highest compared with the
lowest category of GI and T2D remained largely unchanged
(RR: 1.18; 95% CI: 1.14, 1.23; see Supplemental Figure S5
under “Supplemental data” in the online issue).

FIGURE 1. RRs (95% CIs) for type 2 diabetes according to joint cate-
gories of GI (tertiles; A), GL (tertiles; B), and cereal ﬁber (tertiles) in all 3
cohorts combined. Multivariable RRs were adjusted for age (y), BMI (in kg/
m2; ,21, 21–22.9, 23–24.9, 25–26.9, 27–29.9, 30–34.9, 35–39.9, or $40),

menopausal hormone use (women only; premenopausal, postmenopausal
current user, or postmenopausal never/past user), oral contraceptive use
(women only; never, past, or current), physical activity (,3, 3–8.9, 9–

tical tests were conducted by using Cox proportional hazards regression
models. Low GI, high cereal ﬁber: n = 19,524; medium GI, high cereal ﬁber:

identiﬁed for inclusion in the meta-analysis of GI and T2D (10,

(10, 31, 32, 35–45).

DISCUSSION

In these 3 large prospective cohorts of US men and women, we
documented a positive association between GI, GL, and the risk
of T2D. However, GI appears to be more strongly associated with

T2D than does GL. Participants who consumed diets with high
GI or high GL and low cereal ﬁber had a nearly 40% higher risk
of T2D compared with those whose diets were high in cereal
ﬁber and low in GI or GL.

Our ﬁndings are consistent with results of some (35, 38, 43)
but not all (10, 36, 37, 39–42) prospective cohort studies that
examined the association between GI and T2D. RRs com-
paring extreme quintiles of intake of GI ranged from 1.14
(95% CI: 1.01, 1.30)
in the European Prospective In-
vestigation into Cancer and Nutrition–Greek cohort (38) to
1.96 (95% CI: 1.04, 3.67) in a cohort of male Japanese factory
workers (40). In contrast, no associations between GI and risk
of T2D were observed in the Iowa Women’s Health Study
(36), the Whitehall II Study (37), the Health, Aging, and Body
Composition Study (39), the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Cancer
Prevention Study (41), the European Prospective Investigation
into Cancer and Nutrition–InterAct consortium (10), and the
Rotterdam Study (42). Interestingly, all of the studies that
found no association between GI and T2D assessed diet only
at baseline. This may be because any measurement error
(random or systematic) in GI would attenuate the risk esti-
mates toward the null. However, when we used only baseline
diet to examine the association with T2D in our cohorts, we
still documented a 26% higher risk in pooled analysis. The
inconsistencies in ﬁndings between cohorts could also be
a result of differences in databases used to assign GI values to
individual foods. Although most cohorts used the 2002 in-
ternational table of GI values by Foster-Powell et al (46), 2
studies (10, 42) used the more updated international tables of
GI and GL published in 2008 by Atkinson et al (47). Another
important limitation was the subjectivity involved in assigning
GI values to locally grown foods with different processing and
ingredient compositions than those present in the available
databases. There is also considerable debate around the issue
of aggregating GI values of individual foods to calculate the
GI of a mixed meal. Although some studies showed no as-
sociation between calculated GI and measured GI of mixed
meals (48, 49), others showed that the glycemic response to
mixed meals can be predicted from summing the weighted GI
values of foods in the meal (50). Although fat and protein in
mixed meals affect the absolute glycemic response, the rela-
tive differences between carbohydrate-containing foods re-
main unaffected.

In all 3 cohorts, we observed that participants who consumed
a high-GL diet had a more health-conscious lifestyle because they
were less likely to smoke, had a lower BMI, and consumed more
cereal ﬁber. Interestingly, these participants also consumed a low-
fat, high-carbohydrate dietary pattern as evidenced by lower in-
takes of saturated fat, polyunsaturated fat, and total protein. This
may explain the lower risk of T2D observed in age-adjusted GL
models. However, when we accounted for the negative con-
founding introduced by the factors above, the direction of the
association between GL and T2D changed, and a high GL was
associated with a higher risk of T2D. When we further adjusted
for dietary protein, risk estimates became similar to those of
GI because the b-coefﬁcient for GL represents the effect of
substituting high-GI carbohydrate foods with low-GI carbohy-
drate foods while keeping protein, saturated fat, polyunsaturated
fat, and trans fat constant (51). The overall summary risk esti-
mate from our meta-analysis for the association of GL with T2D

is similar but somewhat more attenuated compared with 2 previous
meta-analyses on GL and T2D (8, 9). This may be because the
meta-analysis by Livesey et al (9), double-counted data from the
same cohorts that were published separately and included gesta-
tional diabetes as an outcome. In addition, our meta-analysis in-
cluded updated results with longer follow-up from our cohorts.

Our results show that the effects of cereal ﬁber and GI and GL
are additive. Although no studies have examined the joint effects

of cereal ﬁber and GI and GL in relation to risk of T2D, a recent
systematic review of prospective cohort studies that examined the
association of cereal ﬁber with T2D risk concluded that con-
suming foods rich in cereal ﬁber is associated with a modestly
reduced risk of T2D (52). Our ﬁndings support current dietary
recommendations to consume a diet rich in whole grains and
indicate that a diet low in GI and rich in ﬁber and minimally
processed whole grains may lower the risk of T2D.

GLYCEMIC INDEX AND LOAD AND DIABETES

231

Several physiologic mechanisms have been proposed to ex-
plain the positive association of GI and GL with T2D (53, 54).
High-GI and -GL diets are known to stimulate the increased
production of insulin, resulting in a state of hyperinsulinemia,
which, in turn, can induce insulin resistance. The consumption of
high-GI and -GL diets for several years can increase the demand
on b-cells and lead to b-cell exhaustion and failure (55). Fur-
thermore, because high-GI and -GL diets increase concentra-
tions of blood glucose and free fatty acids (6, 54), chronic
exposure to these elevated concentrations can also induce b-cell
failure. The biological plausibility of an association between GI
and T2D is evident from results of metabolic and intervention
studies. In a meta-analysis of 12 randomized controlled trials
that comprised 612 subjects, low-GI diets reduced glycated
hemoglobin by 0.4% (95% CI: 20.7%, 20.2%) over that pro-
duced by the control diets (56). Furthermore, the Study to Pre-
vent NonInsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus (STOP-NIDDM)
trial, which showed that acarbose, an oral a-glucosidase in-
hibitor, which effectively converts the diet to a low-GI/GL diet,
reduced T2D risk by 25% over a mean follow-up of 3 y provides
a proof-of-concept for low-GI diets (57).

The strengths of the current analysis include the availability of
repeated measures of diet in all 3 cohorts, the long duration and
high-proportion of follow-up, and the large sample size. How-
ever, a few important limitations need to be considered. First, the
use of an FFQ to measure GI and GL introduces some degree of
measurement error. However, given the prospective nature of the
study, measurement error in GI and GL is unrelated to diabetes
case status and is therefore more likely to attenuate the risk
estimates toward the null. Second, the FFQ was validated in
a sample of nurses at an earlier time and in male health pro-
fessionals and the validation data may not directly apply to those
in the NHS II. Furthermore, FFQs in our study were not spe-
ciﬁcally designed to measure GI and GL of foods. However,
previous validation studies in a subsample of older nurses and
male health professionals showed a reasonable degree of cor-
relation between our FFQ and multiple dietary records for both
carbohydrate and ﬁber. In addition, dietary GI and GL in the NHS
were found to be associated with plasma HDL and fasting tri-
glyceride concentrations, indicating the biological validity of the
FFQ in assessing dietary GI and GL (58). Third, our study
population mainly consisted of health professionals of European
ancestry with a high educational status. Although the lack of
racial diversity limits our ability to generalize our results to other
populations, the consistency of our ﬁndings in other ethnic groups
along with existence of strong biological mechanisms may make
our results readily generalizable. The high educational status can
be perceived as an advantage because high-quality and reliable
data can be collected from our study participants. Furthermore,
although we carefully adjusted for several known dietary and
lifestyle factors that could confound the association between
dietary GI and GL and T2D, residual confounding remains
a possibility. Finally, given the observational nature of our study,
we cannot establish true causality.

In conclusion, results from our study conﬁrm that consuming
a high-GI/GL diet is associated with a higher risk of T2D.
Participants who consume diets that are low in cereal ﬁber but
with a high GI/GL have an elevated risk of T2D. Given that the
lifetime risk of developing T2D is 32.8% for men and 38.5% for
women (59), even small excess RRs such as those observed in our

study will translate to large differences in absolute risk and have
important public health implications. Given the consistency of
our results and the ﬁndings of randomized controlled trials of
low-GI diets on measures of glycemia, a large randomized
controlled trial should be considered to evaluate the role of low-
GI and -GL diets in preventing T2D.

We are indebted to the participants in the NHS, the NHS II, and the HPFS
for their continuing outstanding support and colleagues working in these stud-
ies for their valuable help.

The authors’ responsibilities were as follows—SNB: designed and con-
ducted the analysis, interpreted the data, and wrote the manuscript; DKT,
VSM, AP, AH, JEM, WCW, and FBH: assisted in interpreting the data and
edited the manuscript; JEM, WCW, and FBH: obtained funding; managed and

High-Fat, Low-Carbohydrate  Diet and the Etiology of Non-
Insulin-dependent  Diabetes Mellitus: The San Luis Valley
Diabetes Study

Julie A. Marshall, Richard F. Hamman, and Judith Baxter

Diet has long been believed to be an important  risk factor for non-insulin-dependent
diabetes. Animal studies generally support a relation between high-fat diets and devel-
opment  of insulin  resistance.  However, conclusive  epidemiologic  evidence  is lacking.
To further  investigate the role of dietary fat and carbohydrate as potential  risk  factors
for  the onset  of  non-insulin-dependent  diabetes  mellitus,  current  diet  was assessed
among  a geographically  based  group of  1,317 subjects  without  a prior  diagnosis of
diabetes who were  seen in the period from  1984 to 1988 in two counties  in southern
Colorado.  In this  study,  24-hour  diet  recalls  were  reported  prior  to  an oral  glucose
tolerance  test.  Persons  with  previously  undiagnosed  diabetes  (n =  70) and impaired
glucose tolerance (n =  171) were each compared with confirmed  normal controls (n =
1,076). The adjusted odds ratios relating a 40-g/day increase in fat intake to non-insulin-
dependent diabetes mellitus and impaired glucose tolerance were 1.51 (95% confidence
interval 0.85-2.67) and 1.62 (95% confidence interval 1.09-2.41),  respectively. Restrict-
ing  cases  to  diabetic  persons  with  fasting  glucose  >140  mg/dl  and  persons  with
impaired glucose tolerance  confirmed on follow-up, the odds  ratios  increased to 3.03
(95%  confidence  interval  1.07-8.62)  and 2.67 (95% confidence  interval  1.33-5.36),
respectively. The findings support the hypothesis that  high-fat, low-carbohydrate  diets
are  associated  with  the onset  of  non-insulin-dependent  diabetes  mellitus  in humans.

Diet and the Etiology of Non-lnsulin-dependent Diabetes Mellitus  591

etiologic link between  diet and  non-insulin-
dependent diabetes mellitus is lacking (5).

Animal  studies  and  clinical  studies  in
humans  suggest  several  plausible  mecha-
nisms  relating  dietary  fat  to  the  etiology  of
non-insulin-dependent  diabetes  mellitus.
1) High-fat  diets have been  associated  with
increased total body weight (6-8), increased
body  fat  for  a  given  body  weight  (9),  and
altered  distribution  of fat  (9). Each  of these
changes  has  been  associated  with  adverse
alterations  in  glucose  metabolism  (10,  11).
2) A defect  in glycogen storage or fat  oxida-
tion in the presence of a high-fat  diet would
raise  free  fatty  acid  levels and  promote  in-
sulin  resistance  (12,  13).  3)  Alterations  in
cell membrane composition  induced  by the
composition  of  dietary  fat  (14,  15)  could
alter membrane fluidity (16) and/or insulin-
mediated signal transduction (17, 18) as well
as subsequent insulin action (19, 20).

In  order to  investigate  further  the  role of
fat and carbohydrate in the etiology of non-
insulin-dependent  diabetes  mellitus  in  hu-
mans, we conducted cross-sectional analyses
of persons without a prior history of diabetes
from  the  San  Luis  Valley  Diabetes  Study.
We hypothesized that dietary intake high in
total fat and low in total carbohydrate would
be  associated  with  non-insulin-dependent
diabetes  mellitus,  independent  of  known
risk  factors.  This  report  compares  persons
with  previously  undiagnosed  diabetes  and
impaired  glucose  tolerance  to  confirmed
normal  persons  who  reported  their  dietary
intakes  prior  to  a  diagnostic  oral  glucose
tolerance test.

MATERIALS  AND  METHODS

Study population

The  San  Luis Valley  Diabetes  Study  was
designed  to  determine  the  prevalence  and
incidence of non-insulin-dependent  diabetes
mellitus  and  its  complications  among  His-
panic and  non-Hispanic  white  persons  and
to study etiologic and prognostic risk factors
associated  with  non-insulin-dependent  dia-
betes  mellitus.  Detailed  methods  are  re-
ported elsewhere (21). The analyses reported

here  are  based  on  1,317  persons without  a
prior  diagnosis  of  diabetes.  They  were  30-
74 years of age and  seen  during the  period
from  May  1984 to August  1988.

Interview and examination

Subjects  attended  a  4-hour  morning
clinic.  Fasting  blood  samples  were  drawn,
and  then  the  subject  was given  75 g of glu-
cose in  a  flavored,  carbonated,  noncafiein-
ated drink (Koladex  or Orangedex; Custom
Laboratories,  Baltimore,  Maryland).  One-
and  2-hour  blood  samples  were drawn  fol-
lowing  the  glucose  load.  During  this time,
interviews and a physical examination were
conducted. Glucose was measured using the
glucose  oxidase  method  (22)  on  venous
plasma.  The  1985 World  Health  Organiza-
tion  criteria  for  diabetes  (23)  were  used  to
classify  subjects  with  normal  glucose  toler-
ance (n =  1,076), impaired glucose tolerance
(n =  171), and  previously  undiagnosed dia-
betes  (n  =  70).  Four  persons  with  missing
data  were  excluded.  Diabetic  subjects were
subtyped  with  non-insulin-dependent  dia-
betes mellitus because they were previously
undiagnosed,  currently  not  on  insulin, and
38 years of age or older. Of the  171 persons
with  impaired  glucose  tolerance  reported
here,  132 were eligible to  return  for  follow-
up during the period of this analysis. Of 122
subjects seen, 63 had a subsequent diagnosis
of  impaired  glucose  tolerance  (n  =  43)  or
non-insulin-dependent  diabetes  mellitus
(n = 20) (24).

The  1980  US  Census  self-assessment
question  on  Spanish  origin  was used  to de-
termine ethnicity (25). Body mass index was
calculated  as current  measured  weight (kg)/
height  (m)2. The  waist/hip  ratio was calcu-
lated as the waist  circumference  divided by
iliac  circumference.  Waist  circumference
was measured  at the bottom  of the tenth rib
at  midinspiration,  and  the  iliac  circumfer-
ence was measured at the most lateral tip of
the iliac crest. Family history of diabetes was
positive if either biologic parent  or any sib-
ling was reported by the subject to have been
diagnosed with diabetes (26).

Two physical  activity  assessments  are re-

ported here and described in detail elsewhere
(27). Caloric expenditure  for the prior week
was estimated from  a 7-day physical activity
recall  interview.  Additional  questions  on
participation  in vigorous activity at work or
leisure  were  scored  as  1  (no  vigorous activ-
ity), 2 (vigorous activity, but  less than  three
times per week for 20 minutes), or 3 (vigor-
ous activity, at least three times per week for
20  minutes).  Vigorous  activities  could  in-
clude any activity considered by the respon-
dent  to  be strenuous  or to cause  symptoms
such  as  fatigue,  increased  heart  rate,  or
sweating.

thicknesses 

For  the  diet  assessments,  subjects  were
administered  a 24-hour  diet  recall by bilin-
gual interviewers trained and certified by the
Nutrition  Coordinating  Center  at  the  Uni-
versity of Minnesota (28). Two types of aids
were used to assist the subject  in  estimating
portion  sizes.  The  primary  aid  was  a  two-
dimensional  food  portion  visual (29, 30). It
is poster size with an "A" side that has shapes
representing  volumes  and  a  "B" side  with
shapes  and 
for  calculating
weights. Three-dimensional  aids (e.g., ruler,
cups,  bowls,  glasses,  plates,  measuring
spoons) were also available to estimate  por-
tion  sizes if the subject  had  difficulty  using
the  food  portion  visual.  The  Nutrition  Co-
ordinating  Center  coded,  entered,  and  re-
turned  a  nutrient  analysis  for  each  subject.
The  nutrient  analysis was based  on  version
14  of  the  Nutrition  Coordinating  Center's
nutrient data base released in  1987. Alcohol
was  included  in  the  calculation  of calories.
Carbohydrate excludes dietary  fiber.

Statistical  procedures

Adjusted  mean  nutrient  intakes were cal-
culated  using the general linear models pro-
cedure  and  LSMEANS  in  the  Statistical
Analysis  System  (SAS)  (31). Adjusted  odds
ratios  were  estimated  by  logistic  regression
(32)  using  Generalized  Linear  Interactive
Modeling  (GLIM)  (33).  Body  mass  index,
age,  and  dietary  variables  were  entered  as
discrete variables using quartiles and as con-
tinuous variables and were determined to be
best  entered  as continuous  variables  in  the

logistic  model.  It  should  be  noted  that  the
magnitude of the odds ratios depends on the
unit change used for comparison. We chose
the calorie equivalents of 40 g of fat and 90
g of carbohydrate to represent a change that
was reasonable, given the range of the data.
Odds ratios were adjusted for age, sex, ethnic
group, and  total  calories. Since  high-fat  in-
take  may  lead  to  obesity  and  subsequent
insulin resistance, adjustment  for body mass
index  may  underestimate  the  true  effect  of
dietary fat  on  non-insulin-dependent  diabe-
tes  mellitus.  Consequently,  odds  ratios  are
presented both with and without  adjustment
for body mass index. The independent  effect
of total calories was determined by replacing
fat with the calorie-adjusted  residual  for  fat
(34). Finally, using maximum  likelihood es-
timation  in  comparing  two  logistic  regres-
sion  models  with  the  same  number  of
parameters, the  model with the higher like-
lihood (lower -2  natural logarithm (In) like-
lihood) is the model that provides the better
fit  to  the  data.  Likelihoods  were  used  to
determine  which  of  highly  correlated  nu-
trients provided a better fit to the data.

RESULTS

Description of the study subjects

Males reported higher calorie intakes than
females,  and  non-Hispanic  whites  reported
higher intakes than  Hispanics (table  1). To-
tal  calorie  intake  decreased  with  age  (not
shown).  Hispanics  weighed 
less,  were
shorter, but reported similar levels of physi-
cal  activity  when  compared  with  non-
Hispanic whites.

The  previously  undiagnosed  diabetics
were  older  and  heavier  on  average,  more
often  female,  more often  Hispanic, and less
likely to report vigorous activity when com-
pared with normal subjects (table 2). Persons
with  impaired  glucose tolerance were  inter-
mediate on all variables. With regard to diet
(table 3), persons with impaired glucose tol-
erance  reported  significantly  higher  intake
of total  fat  and  lower intake  of total  carbo-
hydrate  and  sucrose  when  compared  with
persons with normal  glucose tolerance  after

adjusting for age, sex, ethnicity, and calories.
Persons  with  non-insulin-dependent  diabe-
tes mellitus  reported  macronutrient  intakes
similar  to  persons  with  impaired  glucose
tolerance, but they were not statistically  dif-
ferent  from  the normal  subjects.

Logistic models comparing glucose-
intolerant and normal subjects

The adjusted  odds ratio (OR) that  related
a  40-g/day  increase  in  fat  intake  to  non-
insulin-dependent  diabetes  mellitus  (OR  =
1.51) and the odds ratio that related  a 90-g/
day decrease in carbohydrate intake to non-
insulin-dependent  diabetes  mellitus  (OR  =
1.39)  were not  statistically  significant  (table
4). When persons with impaired glucose tol-
erance were compared with normal subjects,
the  odds  ratios  were  of  similar  magnitude
(1.62  and  1.56  for  fat  and  carbohydrate,
respectively)  and  were  statistically  signifi-
cant. These data  suggest that  an  increase of
40  g/day  in  fat  intake  for  a  given  calorie
intake would increase an individual's risk of
glucose intolerance by 62 percent. The vari-
able, total  calories, was not an  independent
predictor in these models. The adjusted odds
ratio for  an  increase  in body  mass index of
10 units was 3.7  (95 percent confidence  in-
terval  2.6-5.2)  (table  4).  Fat  and  carbohy-
drate  intakes  are  closely  correlated  (partial
correlation  between  fat  and  carbohydrate
intake  adjusted  for  calories  is  -0.75). Be-
cause of this high correlation,  neither  factor
showed an independent  effect  when entered
into the model simultaneously  (not shown).
Since  diabetes  and  impaired  glucose tol-
erance classifications  have inherent misclas-
sification  due  to  intraindividual  variability
in glucose tolerance, we identified  subsets of
both groups with more specific criteria in an
attempt  to  decrease  this  misclassification.
One  source  of  variability  may  be  lack  of
sufficient  carbohydrate  intake  prior  to  the
oral  glucose  tolerance  test,  which  could re-
sult in an elevated  2-hour  glucose level and
normal  fasting  values.  Therefore,  we  re-
stricted  the  diabetic  group  to all  cases with
a  fasting  glucose  >140  mg/dl  (n  =  24). In
this group,  the  odds  ratio  for  carbohydrate

was  increased  to  2.02  (-2  In  likelihood,
218.43),  and  the  odds  ratio  for  fat  was in-
creased  to  3.03  (-2  In  likelihood,  216.47).
When  the impaired glucose tolerance group
was  restricted  to  persons  having  a  subse-
quent  diagnosis  of  impaired  glucose  toler-
ance or non-insulin-dependent diabetes mel-
litus on  follow-up  (n  =  63), the  odds ratios
also  increased  (1.88;  -2 
likelihood,
445.34; and  2.67;  -2  In  likelihood,  442.14,
for  carbohydrate  and  fat,  respectively).  Fat
had  a  higher  likelihood  than  carbohydrate
in  both  of  these  case-control  comparisons.
This  may  suggest  that  fat  is  the  operating
macronutrient rather than carbohydrate, but
further  supporting  data  are  needed.  The is-
sue of potential misclassification  of diabetics
that led to these analyses is discussed in more
detail below.

In 

Potential modifiers of the effect of
dietary fat on glucose tolerance

Further  models  were  run  to  determine if
the  relation  between  fat  intake  and  glucose
tolerance  varied  by  sex,  ethnicity,  level of
vigorous  activity,  obesity,  waist/hip  ratio,
and family history of diabetes. The tendency
for higher calorie-adjusted  fat intakes among
persons with impaired glucose tolerance and
non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus was
present  in  non-Hispanic  white  males  and

females and in Hispanic males and  females.
The effect  of  fat  did  not  vary  by tertiles of
body mass index, by sex-specific quartiles of
waist/hip  ratio,  or  by  the  presence  or  ab-
sence  of  a  family  history  of  diabetes  (data
not  shown). The  odds ratios  for  a fat  effect
did appear to vary by level of vigorous activ-
ity.  The  interaction  term  between  fat  and
physical activity was not statistically  signifi-
cant, but the significant  odds ratios all occur
at  the  level  of  no  vigorous  activity  (see
table  5),  suggesting  that  high-fat, 
low-
carbohydrate intake may be more important
in  determining  glucose tolerance  in  the ab-
sence of vigorous activity.

Protein and subtypes of fat and
carbohydrate

and 

resistance 

Increased  protein,  sucrose,  fructose,  and
saturated  fat  and  decreased  dietary  fiber
have also been  suggested  as risk  factors  for
insulin 
non-insulin-
dependent  diabetes  mellitus.  These  addi-
tional  dietary  factors  were  examined,  com-
paring  the  full  impaired  glucose  tolerance
case  group  and  the  subset  with  persistent
impaired glucose tolerance with normal sub-
jects. Addition  of protein, sucrose,  fructose,
or dietary fiber to the model with fat  intake
did  not alter the relation  between  fat  intake
and  glucose  tolerance  (data  not  shown). In

addition, none of these factors had an  effect
on glucose  tolerance  independent  of  fat  in-
take.  In  the  comparison  of  persons  with
subsequently  confirmed  impaired  glucose
tolerance with normal controls, total fat  (-2
In  likelihood,  442.14)  provided  a  better  fit
to the data  than  replacing total  fat  by  satu-
rated  fat  (-2  In  likelihood,  446.08)  or  by
protein (-2  In likelihood, 449.84) in an oth-
erwise identical model.

DISCUSSION

Our  findings  are  consistent  with  the ani-
mal  studies  and  clinical  studies  in  humans
that  have  suggested  a  positive  relation  be-
tween  high-fat,  low-carbohydrate  diets  and
the  etiology  of  non-insulin-dependent  dia-
betes mellitus. In  this study, we  minimized
case-control differences  in dietary recall and
avoided dietary changes due to diagnosis by
collecting dietary information  before the re-
sults of the  oral glucose tolerance  test  were
known.  Because  high-fat  diets  have  been
shown to cause insulin resistance in animals
(9) and  because the defect  in  impaired  glu-
cose  tolerance  appears  to  be  insulin  resis-
tance  without  impaired  insulin  secretion
(35), we used persons with previously  undi-
agnosed impaired glucose tolerance as a sec-
ond  comparison  group. The  similar  magni-
tude  of association  in  the  impaired  glucose
tolerance analysis supports the link between
high-fat,  low-carbohydrate  diets  and  im-
paired glucose tolerance in humans. Restric-
the  non-insulin-dependent
tion  of  both 
diabetes  mellitus  and 
impaired  glucose
tolerance  case groups  to  eliminate  potential
misclassification  of  glucose 
tolerance
strengthened the association between  fat in-
take and glucose intolerance, providing  fur-
ther support for the validity of these findings.
In a study of rats, the adverse effects  of a
high-fat diet on insulin resistance were elim-
inated  with  exercise (36). Experimental  ad-
ministration  of a  high-fat  diet  in  physically
trained  men  led to  unaltered  circulating in-
sulin  and  triglyceride  levels  with  increased
muscle  lipoprotein  lipase  activity  and  in-
creased  muscle  triglyceride  (37).  Flatt  (38)
found  that  exercise  increased  the  oxidation

of  fat  relative  to  carbohydrate.  Consistent
with these studies, the data presented in table
5  suggest  that  the  effect  of  dietary  fat  on
glucose tolerance is greatest  in persons with
low levels of vigorous activity.

Subtypes of fat  have different  rates of ox-
idation  (39) and may alter membrane  com-
position  (14).  Either  of  these  changes  may
impair  insulin  action.  In  rats,  sucrose  and
fructose  have  been  associated  with  insulin
resistance (40, 41). In the analyses presented
here, total  fat  was a better  predictor  of glu-
cose  tolerance  than  saturated  fat,  carbohy-
drate,  or  protein.  Subtypes  of  carbohydrate
were not found  to alter the relation between
total fat and glucose tolerance or to be them-
selves  associated  with  glucose  tolerance  in-
dependent  of  fat  intake.  However,  because
of the  animal  and clinical  data,  further  epi-
demiologic studies of refined  sugars by level

of fat intake and studies looking at the com-
plex  relation  among  fatty  acid  saturation,
chain  length,  and  double-bond  position  are
warranted.

Ecologic data comparing disease rates and
food  consumption  data  across  groups  or
over  time  have  been  consistent  with  the
hypothesis that a high-fat,  low-carbohydrate
diet  is  associated  with  increased  rates  of
diabetes. Diverse types of ecologic compari-
sons  have  been  made  (table  6).  Most  have
focused  on diabetes prevalence or  mortality
and  data  from  the  same  populations  on
sugar or fiber consumption, rather than total
fat  or  carbohydrate  consumption.  Ecologic
studies have been reviewed in detail by West
(1). While these ecologic data are consistent
with  the  hypothesis  that  a  high-fat,  low-
carbohydrate  diet  is  a  risk  factor  for  non-
insulin-dependent  diabetes  mellitus,  many

other  social,  economic,  physical  activity,
and  dietary  variables  are  also  correlated
in 
these  group  comparisons  and  may
themselves  be  the  basis  for  the  observed
association.

A  pioneering  case-control 

study  by
Himsworth  and  Marshall  (42)  compared
diets  recalled  prior  to  diagnosis  among  re-
cently diagnosed diabetics with those of nor-
mal  controls,  using two  methods  of  dietary
assessment. In the qualitative  analysis,  food
preferences  that  were  thought  to  indicate
excess fat or carbohydrate  intake were eval-
uated. Twenty percent of diabetics reported
an  excess carbohydrate  intake,  and  76  per-
cent  reported  an  excess  fat  intake.  In  the
normal controls, comparable figures were 34
percent  for  both  carbohydrate  and  fat.  The
quantitative method assessed the quantity of
foods  habitually  eaten.  The  data  were  pre-
sented  by  sex  and  age.  The  percentage  of
calories  from  fat  ranged  from  36.5  to  38.0
percent  in  diabetics  and  from  30.1  to  32.8
percent in controls. Results from both meth-
ods of diet  assessment were consistent  with
the  hypothesis 
low-
carbohydrate  diet  increases the  risk of non-
insulin-dependent  diabetes  mellitus.  The
role  of  obesity  was  not  evaluated  in  these
observations,  but  the  attempts  to  measure
diet prior to diagnosis and to adjust  for total
calories are strengths seen in this study.

that  a  high-fat, 

In a study  of Japanese  American  men  in
Seattle,  Washington,  persons  with  previ-
ously  undiagnosed  non-insulin-dependent
diabetes  mellitus were reported  to  consume
greater  amounts  of  animal  fat  and  animal
protein  than  confirmed  normal  subjects
(43), but  carbohydrate  was not  significantly
different.  No  differences  were  observed  be-
tween  persons  with  impaired  and  normal
glucose  tolerance.  Though  limited  analyses
were done due to small  numbers (17 previ-
ously  unknown  diabetics),  these  findings
support data presented here.

A  prospective  study  of  Pima  Indian
women  reported significantly  higher intakes
of  carbohydrate  and  starch  in  87  women
who  subsequent  developed  diabetes,  com-
pared with  100 women who did not develop

the disease (44). However, the incidence also
increased with  increasing fat  and total calo-
rie  intake.  Calorie-  and  obesity-adjusted
analyses were not  reported.

Most  prospective  studies  to  date  have
reported  no  association  between  diet  and
subsequent  occurrence  of  non-insulin-
dependent  diabetes  mellitus (table 6); how-
ever, problems in the design and analysis of
these  studies  may  account  for  the  lack  of
positive  findings.  In  the  Israeli  Ischemic
Heart  Disease  Study  (45-47),  the  only
calorie-adjusted  analysis included  all  of the
dietary  factors  in  the  logistic  model  simul-
taneously.  The  high  correlations  between
carbohydrate, saturated  fat,  animal  protein,
and sugar intake  may have obscured  an as-
sociation  between  fat  intake  and  2-year in-
cidence  of  non-insulin-dependent  diabetes
mellitus. In Gothenburg, Sweden, no  differ-
ence in the  percentage  of calories from  any
of the  macronutrients  was  reported  by 24-
hour  recall  among  37  women  developing
diabetes after  12 years compared with  1,210
women  remaining  free  of  diabetes  (48).
However,  a  subgroup  of  high-risk  women
who  were  advised  regarding  weight  reduc-
tion  and  lowering  sugar  intake  at  the base-
line  visit  was  included,  and  analyses  were
not age adjusted. Diet histories on a subsam-
ple of 391 normal  subjects and  20 new dia-
betics  showed  a  slightly  lower  fat  intake
among  normals  (39.5  percent  of  calories
from  fat  versus  40.5  percent,  respectively).
The Zutphen  Study  reported  no  significant
associations  in  univariate  survival  analyses
between baseline dietary factors (not  further
specified)  and  25-year  incidence  of  non-
insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (58 new
cases in 841 men  originally free of diabetes)
(49).  Diets  changed  during  the  follow-up
period  (50),  and  time  to  diagnosis  varied
from  2 to  25  years. Associations  may  have
been  missed  if recent  diet, e.g.,  less than  10
years  before  diagnosis,  is  more  important
than diet 20 years prior to diagnosis. In these

models, and design issues related to the tim-
ing  and  temporal  stability  of  dietary  expo-
sures  may  be  obscuring  the  true  relation
between  diet  and  non-insulin-dependent
diabetes mellitus.

In  our  data,  persons  with  previously
undiagnosed  diabetes  or  impaired  glucose
tolerance  reported  higher  fat,  lower  carbo-
hydrate diets than did normal controls when
age,  sex,  ethnicity,  and  calorie  intake  were
held constant.  A potential  limitation  in the
interpretation  of these results may  have oc-
curred if false-positive  diagnoses were made
as a result of inadequate carbohydrate prep-
aration  for  the  oral  glucose  tolerance  test.
While  carbohydrate  preparation  has  been
considered  to  be  important,  West  (1)  con-
cluded that a preparation diet is unnecessary
except  in  individuals  who  have been  losing
weight  or  who  recently  restricted  their  car-
bohydrate  intake  to  less  than  125  g/day,
especially with the newer more conservative
oral glucose tolerance test criteria for diabe-
tes. Four subjects with impaired glucose tol-
erance and two with  non-insulin-dependent
diabetes mellitus had trace or greater ketones
on  a  urine dipstick  (Multistick;  Ames, Elk-
hart,  Indiana),  which  might  have  indicated
a catabolic state. Exclusion of these subjects
did not change the findings. However, since
misclassification  of diabetic  status  resulting
from  a  low-carbohydrate  intake would arti-
ficially  increase  the  odds  ratios  relating  a
low-carbohydrate 
to  non-insulin-
dependent  diabetes  mellitus,  analyses  pre-
sented in the lower half of table 4 were done
to explore whether inadequate  carbohydrate
preparation  could  explain  our  findings.
When  the  diabetic group was limited  to all
cases with a  fasting glucose of > 140 mg/dl,
the odds ratios relating a 40-g increase in fat
intake  (OR  =  3.03)  and  a  90-g decrease in
carbohydrate  intake  (OR  =  2.02)  to  non-
insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus were in-
creased over the original findings. Similarly,
when  persons  with  impaired  glucose  toler-
ance were limited to those with a subsequent
diagnosis  of  impaired  glucose  tolerance  or
non-insulin-dependent  diabetes  mellitus,
the  odds ratios were  2.67  and  1.88,  respec-
tively.  These  results  suggest  that  a  false-

intake 

positive misclassification  of cases due to in-
adequate  carbohydrate  preparation  prior  to
the  oral  glucose  tolerance  test  did  not  ex-
plain  the  findings  that  a  high-fat,  low-
carbohydrate  diet  was associated  with  non-
insulin-dependent  diabetes mellitus.

Since diagnosis was not known at the time
of the interview, previously undiagnosed di-
abetics would not have altered their diet due
to  diagnosis  or  subsequent  dietary  educa-
tion.  However,  it  is  possible  that  food
choices or total intake may have been altered
due  to  physiologic  changes  occurring  with
the  onset  of  diabetes,  prior  to  diagnosis.
When  total  caloric  intake  was adjusted  for
age, there was no pattern in the mean intakes
across subjects with previously  undiagnosed
non-insulin-dependent  diabetes  mellitus,
impaired  and  normal  glucose tolerance,  for
each  sex  and  ethnic  group,  suggesting  that
new-onset  diabetics  did  not  systematically
alter their total  intake prior to diagnosis, as
might be expected if early disease altered the
basal  metabolic  rate  or  urine  losses  of
nutrients.

The  24-hour  diet  recall  method  for  col-
lecting  dietary  data  has  been  criticized  as
unrepresentative  of  an  individual's  usual
diet,  but  our  findings  support  its  use.  The
24-hour diet recall from  an individual  tends
to be an imprecise measure of average intake
in  populations  where  diets  are  highly  vari-
able  from  day-to-day.  However,  similar
numbers  of  persons  are  expected  to  have
high  intakes  and  low  intakes  on  the  recall
day relative to their mean intake. Therefore,
the  24-hour diet  recall provides a good esti-
mate of the group mean when large numbers
of subjects are studied (51). Day-to-day vari-
ability  reduces  the  power  to  detect  dietary
differences  between  subgroups,  but  the sig-
nificant  differences  observed  here  suggest
that the sample size was adequate to account
for  this  problem.  The  presence  of  major
intraindividual  variability  in  the  indepen-
dent variable may mask correlations or bias
the regression toward no effect (52), suggest-
ing that the estimates presented here may be
conservative estimates of the true  effect.

In  some  populations,  the  24-hour  recall
method  has  been  found  to  underestimate

total  intake  (53).  The  same  amount  of
underreporting  in  all  subjects  will not  have
any effect on the comparisons reported here.
Similarly, adjustment  by age and sex in  the
multivariate  analyses  would  account  for  a
systematic  underreporting 
in  Hispanic
women,  if it  existed.  One  study  found  that
obese  subjects  underreport  dietary  intake
more than lean subjects (53). Any systematic
underreporting,  in  our  study,  by  all  obese
subjects  would  be  controlled  for  in  the  re-
sults that are adjusted  for body mass index.
Since  this  adjustment  did  not  alter  the  ob-
served patterns, this potential source of bias
appears unimportant.  Differential  reporting
across  the  disease  groups  being  compared
(e.g., non-insulin-dependent  diabetes melli-
tus, impaired glucose tolerance, and normal)
would create a more serious problem. How-
ever, since glucose tolerance was not known
at  the  time  of  the  dietary  interview,  obese
persons  with  non-insulin-dependent  diabe-
tes mellitus or impaired glucose tolerance in
our  study  would  not  be  expected  to  report
either  more  or  less  accurately  than  obese
persons with normal glucose tolerance.

than 

To  summarize,  the  findings  presented
here support  the hypothesis that a diet high
in fat and low in carbohydrate  increases the
risk  of  developing  glucose  intolerance  and
non-insulin-dependent  diabetes  mellitus.
There  was  a  suggestion,  when  cases  were
limited to eliminate potential false positives,
that  high-fat  intake  may  be  more  highly
associated  with  the  onset  of  non-insulin-
dependent  diabetes  mellitus 
low-
carbohydrate  intake.  In  addition,  vigorous
activity may decrease the adverse effect  of a
high-fat diet on glucose tolerance. This study
contributes new information  to previous in-
consistent findings in the literature  because
diet  was  measured  prior  to  diagnosis, find-
ings  were  similar  in  cases  of  non-insulin-
dependent  diabetes  mellitus  and  cases  of
impaired  glucose  tolerance,  findings  were
strengthened  when  the  case  group  was  re-
stricted  to  prevent  misclassification  of  glu-
cose  tolerance  status,  and  analyses  were
adjusted for potential confounders with con-
sideration  for  potential  effect  modifiers.
From a public health perspective, these find-

ings are  consistent  with  nutritional  recom-
mendations  by  the  American  Diabetes As-
sociation  for  individuals  with  diabetes (54)
and by the American  Heart Association  for
the  prevention  of  heart  disease  (55).  The
results presented here suggest that a decrease
in the  percentage of calories from  fat  or an
increase in carbohydrate consumption could
alter an individual's risk for developing dia-
betes. A randomized  trial of diet and physi-
cal  activity  among  persons  with  impaired
glucose tolerance may be warranted to eval-
uate  a  low-fat,  high-carbohydrate  diet  as  a
prevention 
non-insulin-
for 
dependent diabetes mellitus.

High-fibre, low-fat diet predicts long-term weight loss
and decreased type 2 diabetes risk: the Finnish Diabetes
Prevention Study

Received: 29 September 2005 / Accepted: 7 December 2005 / Published online: 16 March 2006

Abstract Aims/hypothesis: The aim of this study was to
investigate the association of dietary macronutrient
composition and energy density with the change in body
weight and waist circumference and diabetes incidence in
the Finnish Diabetes Prevention Study.
Subjects and
methods: Overweight, middle-aged men (n=172) and
women (n=350) with impaired glucose tolerance were
randomised to receive either ‘standard care’ (control) or
intensive dietary and exercise counselling. Baseline and
annual examinations included assessment of dietary intake
with 3-day food records and diabetes status by repeated
75-g OGTTs. For these analyses the treatment groups were
combined and only subjects with follow-up data (n=500)
were included. Results: Individuals with low fat (<me-
dian) and high fibre (>median) intakes lost more weight
compared with those consuming a high-fat (>median),
low-fibre (<median) diet (3.1 vs 0.7 kg after 3 years). In
separate models, hazard ratios for diabetes incidence
during a mean follow-up of 4.1 years were (highest

weight change, physical activity, baseline 2-h plasma
glucose and intake of the nutrient being investigated.
Compared with the low-fat/high-fibre category, hazard
ratios were 1.98 (95% CI 0.98–4.02), 2.68 (95% CI 1.40–

Conclusions/interpretation: Dietary fat and fibre intake
are significant predictors of sustained weight reduction
and progression to type 2 diabetes in high-risk subjects,
even after adjustment for other risk factors.

Introduction

Recent trials have demonstrated that the risk of type 2
diabetes can be successfully reduced by lifestyle interven-
tion [1, 2]. Weight loss and increased physical activity
achieved as a result of the interventions are significant
predictors of risk reduction [3]. However, it is obvious that
weight reduction can only be achieved by lifestyle change—
that is, either by increasing energy expenditure by physical
activity or by decreasing dietary energy intake.

Reduction in energy intake can be achieved either by
decreasing the total amount of food by portion size control,
or by changing the composition of the diet towards lower
energy density while maintaining the food quantity.
Typically, fat increases while water and fibre decrease
energy density [4]. There is some evidence claiming that

high-fat diets promote energy excess and weight gain [5,
6]; however, the issue remains controversial [7]. Intake of
dietary fibre has been shown to be inversely correlated with
body weight and weight change [8]. In addition to their
possible indirect effect on diabetes risk through body
weight regulation, several dietary factors, such as high-fat
[9, 10], high-saturated-fat [10, 11], and low-fibre intake
[12–15], have been proposed as independent risk factors
for type 2 diabetes.

We have previously shown that in overweight, middle-
aged men and women with impaired glucose tolerance who
participated in the Finnish Diabetes Prevention Study
(DPS), intensive lifestyle intervention, compared with the
‘standard care’ control group, resulted in modest weight
loss (4.5 vs 1.0 kg after 1 year) and a 58% reduction in
diabetes risk [1, 16]. However, the independent effect of
the dietary composition on weight change and risk for type
2 diabetes was not analysed. The aim of the present study
was to utilise the DPS data to assess the association
between dietary macronutrient composition, in particular
dietary fat, fibre and energy density and change in body
weight and waist circumference and diabetes risk.

Subjects and methods

Altogether, 522 individuals participated in the Finnish
DPS. The study design has been described in detail
previously [1, 16, 17]. According to the inclusion criteria,
study subjects (172 men and 350 women) were middle-
aged (40–64 years) and overweight (BMI>25 kg/m2) at
baseline, and had impaired glucose tolerance according to
WHO 1985 criteria [18]. All study subjects gave written
informed consent and the study protocol was approved by
the National Public Health
the ethics committee of
Institute, Helsinki, Finland.
Individuals who did not
participate in any annual follow-up visits by year 3
(n=15) or who had missing data on dietary intake at
baseline (n=1) or during the follow-up (n=6) had to be
excluded from the current analyses.

The study participants were advised to lose weight,
increase physical activity and consume a moderate-fat
(total fat<30% of energy [E%], saturated fat<10 E%), high-
fibre (>15 g/1,000 kcal) diet. For the participants in the
control group the lifestyle advice was given as ‘standard
care counselling’ at baseline. The participants in the
intensive intervention group were given individualised,
detailed dietary counselling, with seven sessions during the
first year and every 3 months thereafter [1, 16]. They were
also offered free-of-charge supervised resistance-training-
based physical activity sessions. In addition, altogether 48
of the participants in the intervention group chose to
engage in a 2- to 5-week very-low-calorie diet (VLCD)
phase to boost weight reduction.

The baseline and annual clinical examination included
measurements of weight (in light indoor clothes to the
nearest 100 g), height (without shoes to the nearest 1 mm),
and waist circumference (midway between the lowest rib

913

and iliac crest to the nearest 1 mm). BMI was calculated
dividing the weight (kg) by the height (m) squared.

Questionnaires regarding medical history, exercise and
dietary habits were collected at baseline and each annual
visit. Subjects were classified as having a family history of
diabetes if at least one parent had diabetes. Those who
smoked on at least 5 days per week were categorised as
regular smokers. Leisure time physical activity during the
previous year was estimated using the validated Kuopio
Ischaemic Heart Disease Risk Factor Study 12-month
Leisure-Time Physical Activity questionnaire [19], and
physical activity (min/week) at baseline and during the
intervention period were added into the adjusted models as
cofactors.

The study subjects completed a 3-day food record at
baseline and before every annual study visit. They were
asked to write down everything they ate and drank (except
plain drinking water) using a picture booklet of portion
sizes of typical foods as the reference. The completeness of
the food records was checked at the face-to-face session
with the study nutritionist during the study visit. The
nutrient intakes were calculated with a dietary analysis
programme developed at
the National Public Health
Institute [20] as E% values for energy-yielding nutrients
and fibre density per 1,000 kcal. Food weight was
calculated from the food records as total amount of foods
and beverages consumed (g), excluding only drinking
water and mineral water. Energy density was calculated by
dividing energy (kcal) of food with food weight (100 g).
The averaged intake during the year 1 (n=499), 2 (n=467)
and 3 (n=424) was used in the analyses.

The annually measured biochemical parameters in-
cluded fasting and 2-h post-challenge (75-g OGTT) plasma
glucose after a 12-h fast. Plasma glucose was determined
locally according to standard guidelines. The development
of type 2 diabetes was the primary endpoint. Diabetes was
defined according to the WHO 1985 criteria [18], i.e. either
fasting plasma glucose ≥7.8 mmol/l or 2-h post-challenge
plasma glucose ≥11.1 mmol/l. The diagnosis of diabetes
had to be confirmed by a second OGTT. After the diagnosis
of diabetes had been established, the subject was referred to
his/her own physician for treatment, and the follow-up in
the DPS was discontinued. A highly significant difference
in the incidence of diabetes between the treatment groups
was detected after 3.2 years of follow-up [1], and therefore
the intervention phase was terminated prematurely after a
mean duration of 3.9 years (range 0–6 years).

Statistical analyses were performed with the statistics
package Stata (release 8.0; STATA, College Station, TX,
USA). In all analyses of the present paper the two treatment
groups were pooled, and the group assignment was used as
a cofactor in the adjusted models. Weight and waist
circumference change from baseline to year 3 was
calculated by subtracting the value at year 0 from the
value at year 3. The last-observation-carried-forward
(LOCF) method was used in the calculations for those
who were diagnosed with diabetes (n=53) or dropped out
(n=18) before the 3-year visit.

914

Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) and χ2-tests were
used to analyse the baseline and follow-up period differ-
ences between those who developed diabetes during the
follow-up and those who did not. The ANCOVA adjusting
for group assignment, age, VLCD-use as part of the
intensive intervention (adjusted to ‘not used’), physical
activity at baseline and during the follow-up period, and
baseline weight and nutrient intakes, was used to analyse
the associations of quartiles of dietary intake during the
follow-up with weight and waist circumference changes.
Adjustment for the baseline intake of the nutrient
in
question was used to control for regression-to-the-mean
effect, since those who report extreme intakes are, due to
intra-individual variation,
less extreme
intakes at follow-up. Trends across the quartiles were
analysed by adding the quartile into the model as a
continuous variable.

likely to report

The Cox model was used to calculate the hazard ratios
(HRs) for developing diabetes between quartiles of dietary
intake, with the lowest quartile as the reference category.
These analyses were adjusted for group assignment, sex,
age, physical activity at baseline and during the follow-up
period, baseline weight, baseline nutrient intake, and the
baseline 2-h post-challenge plasma glucose, and in further
analyses, with the weight change from baseline to year 3.
To clarify the combined effect of dietary fat E% and fibre
density, participants were divided into low- (below median)
and high- (above median) intake groups. Between these
categories, ANCOVA was used to analyse effects on the
weight reduction and the Cox model to analyse effects on
diabetes risk.
In all analyses p<0.05 was considered
statistically significant.

At baseline, mean (±SD) age of the study participants was
55±7 years, mean BMI was 31±4 kg/m2, mean fasting
plasma glucose was 6.1±0.7 mmol/l and mean plasma
glucose 2 h after glucose load was 8.9±1.5 mmol/l.
Cholesterol-lowering drugs were used by 5% and blood
pressure-lowering drugs by 29% of the participants. A
family history of diabetes was common: 63% of the
participants had at least one parent with diabetes. Only 5%
were regular smokers.

After a mean follow-up of 4.1 years, 114 of the 500
participants had been diagnosed with diabetes. Those who
developed diabetes were more obese at baseline, measured
as weight, BMI or waist circumference, and they had
higher fasting and 2-h plasma glucose values (Table 1). The
individuals who remained free of diabetes lost more weight
and reduced their waist circumference more, also after
adjustment for sex, group assignment and baseline value of
obesity (BMI, weight or waist circumference), and they did
not experience deterioration of glucose values during the
first 3 years of the study.

Subjects who were diagnosed with diabetes tended to
consume a diet with lower carbohydrate and fibre content,
and also higher in alcohol at baseline (Table 2). The

reported alcohol consumption (2–3 E%) was, however, low
throughout the study. Among those who remained free of
diabetes, E% of carbohydrates and fibre density increased
further, and energy proportions of total, saturated and
mono-unsaturated fat, and intake of cholesterol decreased
compared with those who were diagnosed with diabetes
during the study.

In separate models, fibre density, fat E% and energy
density of the diet during the follow-up were associated
with weight reduction, after adjustment for group assign-
ment, sex, physical activity, VLCD-use, baseline weight
and baseline nutrient intake (Table 3). Weight loss was
related to an increase in fibre (p for trend=0.001) and
decrease in fat (p for trend=0.018) and energy density (p for
trend=0.001). Fibre density of the diet was inversely
associated with the change in waist circumference even
after adjustment for weight change (p for trend=0.033).

A total of 147 (29%) of the study subjects had lost 5% or
more of their baseline weight at year 3. Fibre density, fat
E%, saturated fat E% and energy density were separately
associated with sustained >5% weight reduction, after
adjustments for potential confounders. The most signifi-

were associated with a reduced diabetes risk. Further
adjustment for weight change during the trial did not affect
the results notably. When both fat and fibre were simulta-
neously entered into the same adjusted prediction model,
due to multicollinearity (r=0.60) neither was a significant
predictor for diabetes: the HR was 0.88 (95% CI 0.68–1.16)
according to increasing fibre density quartile and 1.23 (95%
CI 0.95–1.58) according to increasing fat E% quartile.

The adjusted 3-year weight reduction among those
whose diet was both low in fat and high in fibre was 3.1 kg
(95% CI 2.3–3.9 kg) (Fig. 1). Among the subjects whose
diet was high in fat and low in fibre, weight reduction was
significantly less at 0.7 kg (95% CI for weight change −1.7
to +0.1 kg). Compared with low-fat/high-fibre diet, the HR
for diabetes was 1.98 (95% CI 0.98–4.02, p=0.06) in the
low-fat/low-fibre category, 2.68 (95% CI 1.40–5.10,
p=0.003) in the high-fat/high-fibre category and 1.89
(95% CI 1.09–3.30, p=0.024) in the high-fat/low-fibre
category (Fig. 2).

Discussion

We used the DPS data to assess the association between
dietary composition and change in weight and diabetes
risk. The analyses revealed that a decrease in dietary fat and
energy density and an increase in fibre density were
associated with sustained weight reduction in a dose-
dependent manner. Furthermore, low-fat and high-fibre
intakes predicted decreased diabetes risk independently of
body weight change and physical activity.

for weight

A debate about optimal diet

reduction
prevails. Studies with strictly controlled energy intake
have shown that weight reduction can be achieved with any
dietary regimen as long as energy intake is lower than
energy expenditure [21–24]. Permanently reduced energy
intake, which is essential after weight reduction unless
energy expenditure by physical activity is clearly in-
creased, is more difficult to achieve [25]. Our results offer
support for the validity of the current recommendations to
reduce fat and increase fibre-rich carbohydrate intake, to
achieve sustained long-term weight reduction.

Reduction of fat intake has for several decades been the
conventional approach for weight control. According to a
review by Astrup et al. [26], a 4–5 kg weight loss can be
achieved with 10 E% reduction in dietary fat in obese
individuals, at least in short-term (<1 year) studies. Fat
contains more energy per gram than other energy-yielding
nutrients and also makes the diet palatable, but simulta-
neously less satiating, and therefore a high-fat diet
is
believed to promote weight gain [5, 6]; however the issue is
controversial [7]. In recent studies [27–29] a low-carbo-
hydrate diet resulted in more pronounced short-term weight
reduction compared with a conventional low-energy, low-
fat dietary regimen, probably because the achieved energy
deficit was larger. However, the statistically significant
difference in early weight
loss between the groups
disappeared at 12 months [27, 30, 31], indicating that
individuals are not able to adhere to such a restricted diet.

cant dietary predictor for achieving large weight reduction
was energy density, the multivariate adjusted odds ratio
being 0.19 (95% CI 0.08–0.41) in the highest compared
with the lowest quartile (Table 4).

HRs for diabetes incidence by quartiles of dietary intakes
are given in Table 5. In the analysis adjusted for group
assignment, sex, age, baseline weight, baseline 2-h glucose,
physical activity and baseline intake, higher fibre density (p
for trend=0.01) and lower fat intake (p for trend=0.004)

Moreover, the long-term safety of low-carbohydrate diets
in weight-stable individuals is not known [32].

Still another popular, and evidently efficient [22, 31]
weight-loss approach is to increase protein intake up to
30% of total energy, with a decrease in either fat or
carbohydrate. An increase in protein intake may increase
patient satisfaction during a low-fat, energy-restricted diet
[22] and has been shown to accelerate weight loss [33] and
prevent weight regain [34]. In our study we emphasised
adequate protein intake (0.8 g/1 kg body weight) but did
not advise to increase it more than that. It is impossible to
say whether advocating an increase in protein would have
led to larger weight reduction than was achieved in our
study. We did, however, also analyse the association of the
protein intake (E%) quintile with weight reduction and
diabetes incidence, but did not see any significant effects
(data not shown).

The intake of dietary fibre has been shown to be
inversely correlated with body weight and weight reduction
[8, 35, 36]. Fibre may increase satiation directly by
increasing gastric distension and thereby giving a feeling of
fullness, or indirectly through secretion of gut hormones
(incretins), and satiety through delaying gastric emptying
and nutrient absorption. Furthermore, fibre may decrease
dietary energy intake by reducing absorption of fat and
protein [8]. In the present study an increase in dietary fibre
intake was also associated with a reduced waist circum-
ference, independently of weight change. A similar finding
was previously seen in an observational study on American

male health professionals [37]. The mechanism explaining
the inverse association between waist circumference and
fibre intake is not clear. The effect of dietary fibre may be
mediated by changes in insulin resistance. High-fibre
intake has been shown to be associated with enhanced
insulin sensitivity [38–40]. On the other hand,
insulin
resistance may, as discussed by Kahn and Flier [41]

contribute to the development of obesity. Smoking is
known to increase central obesity [42]. In our study,
smoking was remarkably uncommon, and thus did not
confound the association between fibre intake and waist
circumference. The low rate of smoking may be explained
by the fact that the study participants were volunteers and
probably more health-conscious than the general popula-
tion.

A recently recognised factor potentially influencing
nutrient intake is the energy density of the diet [43]. People
have been shown to be only partly able to compensate for
changes in dietary energy density by increasing or
decreasing the total amount of food, at least in short-term
clinical studies [44, 45]. In our analysis, dietary energy
density was highly significantly associated with sustained
weight reduction; on the other hand, energy density is a
composite factor of dietary fat, fibre and water. Weight
reduction among the low-fat/high-fibre consumers was
threefold compared with the high-fat/low-fibre group,
indicating that
to achieve the best results one should
make extensive changes in dietary pattern, rather than
focusing on any single nutrient.

Obesity is a well-established risk factor for type 2
diabetes, and we have previously shown that in the DPS
population diabetes risk was reduced dose-dependently
with weight reduction [46]. Obesity increases insulin
resistance, and in a subgroup analysis of the DPS study
population a strong inverse correlation was found between
the 4-year weight change and insulin sensitivity [47]. In
addition, according to the present analyses the composition
of the diet affected diabetes risk independently of weight
change. Several epidemiological studies have shown that
low intake of total fat [9, 10], saturated fat [10, 11] and high
intake of cereal, cereal fibre and total fibre [12–15], are
associated with decreased diabetes risk during the follow-
up period. In most of these studies, dietary changes during
the follow-up period were typically not taken into account.

In our study, the participants were advised to make changes
in their diet, and dietary intake was monitored continually.
Furthermore,
intakes
during the follow-up and diabetes risk was adjusted for
baseline nutrient intakes.

the association between nutrient

Type of fat (namely, high saturated and trans-fatty acid
and low unsaturated fatty acid intake), rather than total fat
intake, has in several studies been associated with
increased diabetes risk [48]. In our study the total and
saturated fat intakes were highly correlated (r=0.81) and
the intake of mono-unsaturated fat remained relatively
stable throughout the study. Furthermore, the intake of
trans-fatty acids was low, on average 0.7 E% (data not
shown). This might explain why total fat intake was the fat-
related variable most consistently associated with diabetes
risk in our analyses.

Our study,

like dietary intake trials in general, has
several limitations. The dietary intervention was planned to
encourage an increase in dietary fibre and a decrease in fat
intake, and it is possible that individuals who succeeded in
weight reduction were more likely to report consuming ‘the
recommended diet’. In addition to dietary changes, the
participants were advised to increase physical activity.
Therefore, all the models to investigate the effect of dietary
composition were adjusted for physical activity at baseline
and during the intervention, but some residual confounding
might remain. Furthermore, the energy intakes calculated
from the food records revealed that under-reporting had
taken place. However, this may not be too problematic,
because we calculated energy proportions of nutrients and
not absolute amounts. Overweight and obese people are
known to be even more prone to dietary under-reporting
than normal-weight individuals. Such an under-reporting
has been shown to be a stable characteristic of an individual
[49], and as the results were adjusted for the baseline, it
may not cause a bias in our study. Changes in specific
dietary intakes were correlated: those who decreased fat-
containing foods increased carbohydrate- and fibre-con-
taining foods, and simultaneously the energy density of the
diet decreased. This real-life phenomenon is problematic in
statistical analyses. When the predictors entered into a
model simultaneously have multicollinearity, they tend to
attenuate each other, as also shown in our data. Therefore,
instead of calculating one model
including all dietary
variables, we used separate models, and selected the two
most significant predictors for the combined analysis. The
highest diabetes risk was seen among the high-fat/high-
fibre and not, as would have been expected, among the
high-fat/low-fibre consumers. The HRs, however, did not
differ statistically significantly and thus the effect may be
coincidental, or due to confounding by some unknown
factors.

We have shown that a long-term weight reduction during
the Finnish DPS was best achieved by reducing energy
density and dietary fat and increasing fibre intake. As for
the long-term health benefits, our results strongly support
the validity of the current dietary recommendations to the
general population: reducing the intake of saturated fat and
increasing fibre-rich whole-grain cereals and fruit and

vegetables, is important, not only in terms of overall health
but also for sustained weight reduction and the prevention
of type 2 diabetes in overweight individuals.

Abstract

While experimental and observational studies suggest that sugar intake is associated with the development of type 2
diabetes, independent of its role in obesity, it is unclear whether alterations in sugar intake can account for differences in
diabetes prevalence among overall populations. Using econometric models of repeated cross-sectional data on diabetes
and nutritional components of food from 175 countries, we found that every 150 kcal/person/day increase in sugar
availability (about one can of soda/day) was associated with increased diabetes prevalence by 1.1% (p ,0.001) after testing
for potential selection biases and controlling for other food types (including fibers, meats, fruits, oils, cereals), total calories,
overweight and obesity, period-effects, and several socioeconomic variables such as aging, urbanization and income. No
other food types yielded significant individual associations with diabetes prevalence after controlling for obesity and other
confounders. The impact of sugar on diabetes was independent of sedentary behavior and alcohol use, and the effect was
modified but not confounded by obesity or overweight. Duration and degree of sugar exposure correlated significantly with
diabetes prevalence in a dose-dependent manner, while declines in sugar exposure correlated with significant subsequent
declines in diabetes rates independently of other socioeconomic, dietary and obesity prevalence changes. Differences in
sugar availability statistically explain variations in diabetes prevalence rates at a population level that are not explained by
physical activity, overweight or obesity.

Introduction

Global diabetes prevalence has more than doubled over the last
far exceeding modeled
three decades, with prevalence rates
projections, even after allowing for improved surveillance. Nearly
1 in 10 adults worldwide are now affected by diabetes [1]. This
striking statistic has led to investigation into the population drivers
of diabetes prevalence. Most of the worldwide rise is thought to be
type 2 diabetes linked to the ‘‘metabolic syndrome’’ – the cluster of
metabolic perturbations that includes dyslipidemia, hypertension,
and insulin resistance. Obesity associated with economic develop-
ment — particularly from lack of exercise and increased
consumption of calories — is thought to be the strongest risk
factor for metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes [2–5].

At a population level, however, obesity does not fully explain
variations and trends in diabetes prevalence rates observed in
many countries. As shown in Figure 1, several countries with high
diabetes prevalence rates have low obesity rates, and vice versa.
High diabetes yet low obesity prevalence are observed in countries
with different ethnic compositions,
the Philippines,
Romania, France, Bangladesh and Georgia, although there are
likely surveillance quality differences between nations
[6,7].
Trends in diabetes and obesity are also dyssynchronous within

such as

some nations; while Sri Lanka’s diabetes prevalence rate rose from
3% in the year 2000 to 11% in 2010, its obesity rate remained at
0.1% during that time period. Conversely, diabetes prevalence in
New Zealand declined from 8% in 2000 to 5% in 2010 while
obesity rates in the country rose from 23% to 34% during that
decade. Similar trends of declining diabetes rates despite rising
obesity rates were observed in Pakistan and Iceland. There are not
obvious ethnic or socio-demographic commonalities between these
countries to explain these observations. This population-level
puzzle is accompanied by individual-level data. About 20% of
obese individuals appear to have normal insulin regulation and
normal metabolic indices (no indication of diabetes) and normal
longevity [8], while up to 40% of normal weight people in some
populations manifest aspects of the ‘‘metabolic syndrome’’ [9–12].
These findings direct attention to determining additional risk
factors for development of diabetes. One controversial hypothesis
is that excessive sugar intake may be a primary and independent
driver of rising diabetes rates [13]. Sugars added to processed food,
in particular the monosaccharide fructose, can contribute to
obesity [14], but also appear to have properties that increase
diabetes risk independently from obesity [15]. For example, liver
fructose metabolism in the fed state generates lipogenic substrates

been significantly associated with the development of

insulin inadequacy [22,23].

In concert,

Fructose is often consumed as high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS;
42% or 55% fructose) in the U.S., Canada, Japan, and some parts
of Europe, while the rest of the world primarily consumes sucrose
(50% fructose). Globally, countries have experienced a rise in
sugar supply from an average of 218 kilocalories/person/day in
1960 to over 280 kilocalories/person/day today, with an acceler-
ation in the rate of supply over the past decade. Assuming a 30%
food wastage rate [24], these sugar calories exceed the recom-
mended daily upper limit of 150 kilocalories per man and
100 kilocalories per woman suggested by the American Heart
Association [25].

The issue of whether added sugars may be a population-level
driver of the diabetes pandemic is of importance to global health
policy. If obesity is a primary driver of diabetes, then measures to
reduce calorie consumption and increase physical activity should
be prioritized. However, if added sugar consumption is a primary
driver, then public health policies to reduce sugar consumption
warrant investigation as diabetes prevention proposals—especially
for developing countries where diabetes rates are rising dramat-
ically, irrespective of obesity.

In this study, we conducted a statistical assessment of panel data
(repeated multi-variate data from multiple countries over a time

to empirically evaluate whether changes

period)
in sugar
availability, irrespective of changes in other foodstuffs, can in part
account for the divergence in diabetes prevalence rates worldwide.

Methods

We used United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization
food supply data [26] to capture market availability of different
food items (sugars, fibers, fruits, meats, cereals, oils, and total food)
in kilocalories per person per day in each country for each year of
the analysis. The dependent variables
in the analysis were
International Diabetes Federation estimates of diabetes prevalence
among persons aged 20 to 79 years old from 2000 through 2010
[6]. We controlled for gross domestic product per capita (GDP
expressed in purchasing power parity in 2005 US dollars for
comparability among countries), percent of population living in
urban areas, and percent of population above the age of 65 for
each country in each year of the analysis from the World Bank
World Development Indicators Database 2011 [27], and the
prevalence overweight and obesity (percent of the population aged
15 to 100 years old with body mass index greater than or equal to
25 kg/m2 and 30 kg/m2, respectively) from the World Health
Organization Global Infobase 2012 edition [7]. Data sources and
summary statistics are further described in the Supporting
Information (Text S1 and Table S1).

Data monitoring and quality was assessed through several
approaches. First, a Hausman test [28] was performed to test
whether factors that differ across countries such as the differing
strength of diabetes surveillance systems would systematically
affect our results, ensuring the available data were suitable to
answer our research questions. This assesses for how reports of
diabetes rates and food consumption may systematically differ
between countries, so that such differences can be incorporated as
controls in the statistical models. Selection bias may be an

issue for assessing the effect of sugar on diabetes
prevalence rates. Having greater sugar available in a country, for
example, may be an artifact of overall economic development and
increased general
food importation, which could temporally
overlap with rising diabetes prevalence irrespective of higher
sugar intake (e.g., due to increased sedentary living or higher
calorie intake leading to obesity). We controlled for this possibility
using a lag of the change in log GDP per capita in our models. We
also modeled the hazard of having high sugar availability rates in
each country, and used this constructed hazard variable to
explicitly control
(a
‘‘Heckman selection model’’, see Text S1) [29]. We also used a
set of period effects to control for secular trends in the diabetes and
sugar data that may have occurred as a result of changes in
countries’ diabetes detection capacity or

We subsequently added additional variables

or other food components with diabetes prevalence, the duration
of exposure to high calorie availability from sugar, and the effect of
reduced sugar availability. We further tested the impact of
introducing a measure of
the estimated
percentage of the population aged 15 years and older that is
physically inactive from the International Physical Activity
Questionnaire [31](defined as not meeting any of three criteria:
(a) 5630 minutes of moderate-intensity activity per week;
(b)
3620 minutes of vigorous-intensity activity per week;
(c) an
equivalent combination achieving 600 metabolic equivalent-
minutes per week). Further control variables were the percent of
persons above age 15 years who currently smoke tobacco, from
the WHO Global Infobase [32], and the percent who engage
heavy episodic alcohol drinking (at least 60 grams or more of pure
alcohol on at least one occasion weekly), from the WHO Global
Information System on Alcohol and Health [33].

Sugar and Diabetes

We also performed Granger-causality tests, which use the
temporal nature of the data to test whether high sugar availability
preceded an increase in diabetes (‘‘precedence’’) or whether high
diabetes prevalence preceded high sugar availability [34] (see Text
S1). Data were analyzed in STATA v10.1. In all analyses, food
availability data were age-adjusted, regressions were population
weighted, and robust standard errors were computed to ensure

Results

Correlates of diabetes prevalence

Table 1 presents the results of the cross-national model from
2000 to 2010. Each 150 kilocalorie/person/day increase in total
calorie availability related to a 0.1% rise in diabetes prevalence
(not significant), whereas a 150 kilocalories/person/day rise in
sugar availability (one 12 oz. can of soft drink) was associated with
a 1.1% rise in diabetes prevalence (95% CI: 0.48–1.7%; p,0.001)
after all control variables were incorporated into the model. These
controls included current income, changes in income, urbaniza-
tion, aging, obesity, and the consumption of other foods as well as
period effects (secular correlations that may have occurred simply
due to surveillance changes or economic development). Diabetes
prevalence rates rose 27% on average from 2000 to 2010, with just
over one-fourth of the increase explained by a rise in sugar
availability in this model. In countries
like the Philippines,
Romania, Sri Lanka, Georgia and Bangladesh, where high and
rising diabetes rates were observed in the context of low obesity
rates, sugar availability rose by over 20% during the study period.
(It is possible that weight gain, rather than overt obesity, might
account for some of the changes in diabetes, hence our models
were repeated with overweight prevalence rather than obesity in
Table S3, and with measures of physical inactivity rather than
BMI in Table S4, but the results did not change).

Several of

the main control variables

in the model had
important effects. The coefficient of log Gross Domestic Product
(GDP) per capita was 1.07, which means that a 1% increase in
GDP levels corresponded to a 1.07% rise in diabetes prevalence
(p,0.05), consistent with the notion that economic development is
a powerful correlate to diabetes prevalence [35,36]. Similarly,
variables capturing urbanization and aging populations were
associated with diabetes prevalence; however these variables fell
from significance as total
food availability and obesity were
incorporated into the model (Table 1), suggesting that calorie
consumption and obesity are among the pathways by which these
other factors may contribute to diabetes, consistent with cross-
sectional studies [37].

A potential criticism of the basic finding is that, given the effect
of obesity on the risk of diabetes and the high prevalence of both
obesity and sugar availability in developed countries, our results
are not due to sugar per se but rather confounded by rising obesity
rates. In Table 1, we see that sugar availability remained a
significant correlate to diabetes prevalence independent of obesity
and total calorie consumption. When obesity was removed from
the model, the effect size of sugar was not significantly amplified
(beta = 0.0081, p,0.001), suggesting that obesity does not appear
to account for the major part of the impact of sugar on diabetes.
We additionally tested whether sugar availability alone was a
significant predictor of obesity rates independent of the other
control variables (total consumption, urbanization, aging, income,
other
foods and period effects), and found the expected
relationship between total calories and obesity, but not individually

between sugar and obesity when total calories was accounted for—
consistent with the hypothesis being tested (see Table S5).

None of the other food categories — including fiber-containing
foods (pulses, nuts, vegetables, roots, tubers), fruits, meats, cereals,
and oils — had a significant association with diabetes prevalence
rates. We tested the hypothesis that low-carbohydrate fibers (nuts
and vegetables) might be protective against diabetes by individ-
ually including them in the regression (as opposed to all fiber-
containing foods) but they had no significant effect, and did not
change the impact of sugar on diabetes prevalence. We initially
separated fruit from other vegetables/fibers given the potential
glucose burden of fruit; when repeating the analysis combining
fruits with vegetables and other fibers, the results did not change.

Tests of sugar exposure

As opposed to absolute sugar availability in kilocalories, the
fraction of sugar in the available food market (the percent of total
available calories composed of by sugar) may also be a critical

factor in diabetes. As shown in Table 2, the fraction of total
calories arising from sugar was the only significant food fraction
correlated with diabetes, with a 1% rise in the fraction of total food
calories as sugar corresponding to a 0.167% rise in diabetes
prevalence.

We also tested whether the number of years a country was
exposed to ‘‘high sugar availability’’, which we defined as at least
300 kcal/person/day (twice the upper recommended daily limit
for men, [25]) had a relationship with diabetes prevalence, by
introducing a count variable for the number of years exposed to
high sugar. Under the hypothesis being tested, longer exposure to
sugar would correspond to greater effects on diabetes risk. We
found that each extra year of exposure to high sugar availability
was associated with an increase in diabetes prevalence of 0.053%
(p,0.05) after all other control variables were included (Table 3).

Additional robustness checks

To further test whether influence runs from sugar availability to
higher diabetes prevalence, and not vice versa (that is, to confirm
that sugar availability did not increase as a result of whatever other
factors associated with economic development or other unob-
served variables may have raised diabetes prevalence), we tested
the effects of lowering sugar availability. We found that in the
periods after a country lowered its sugar availability (typically in
the context of changes in trade agreements, discussed at length
reduced by 0.074%
elsewhere,
[38]), diabetes prevalence
(p,0.05), after correcting for changes
in all other controls
including the economic variables, socio-demographic variables,
and changes in consumption of other food products as well as total
calories and obesity prevalence (see Table S1).

We subsequently used Granger temporal causality tests (see
Text S1) to test the robustness of this finding. We identified a
significant
relationship between high sugar availability and
subsequently higher diabetes prevalence rates, not vice versa.
Hence sugar availability did not violate criteria for temporal
causality.

We conducted a series of additional robustness checks and
regression diagnostics to test the sugar-diabetes relationship (see
Tables S3, S4). Figure 2 shows the plot of sugar availability and

diabetes rates among all countries in the sample after control
variables were introduced into the regression. First we removed
potential outlying countries from this regression, liberally defined
as countries having standardized residuals in the main model
greater than the absolute value of 2. The results were strength-
ened: a 150 kcal/person/day rise in sugar availability correspond-
ed to a 1.2% rise in diabetes prevalence (p,0.001) as opposed to a
1.1% rise when outliers were included. We also used other
estimation approaches, including a time-series model that accounts
for how earlier years in the regression may predict trends in later
years and thereby throw off common regression models (an
autoregressive time-series model using Stata’s xtregar module to
explicitly estimate serial correlation), and the results remained
significant: each 150 kcal/person/day rise in sugar availability
related to a 0.4% rise in diabetes prevalence (p,0.001). We also
re-ran these robustness checks with controls for country-specific
factors (fixed effects) and without period effects, as well as using
only direct diabetes survey data rather than some of the diabetes
data that were imputed estimates by the International Diabetes
Federation, and without the U.S. in the sample given a lower ratio
of food consumption to supply in the U.S. than in other nations
(higher food waste) [24]. In all cases, the sugar variable maintained
a similar association with diabetes prevalence.

Additional control variables

There are many additional epidemiological correlates

to
diabetes prevalence, and any econometric study is subject to
limitations of data quality. We attempted to minimize any such
potential confounding by introducing additional data measures
and sources to test the robustness of our primary model. First, we
reassessed our models using overweight (BMI $ 25 kg/m2) instead
of obesity (BMI $ 30 kg/m2)
in case obesity was a late-stage
predictor of diabetes. We also incorporated physical inactivity,
which has also been related to diabetes [39]. Lastly, a high
prevalence of smoking and heavy alcohol use have been associated
with diabetes [5]. Incorporation of these factors (see Table S4) did

Controlling for selection bias

These results may have been driven by another aspect of the
changing environment for which we have not controlled. We
addressed the issue of unobserved selection bias directly by
constructing, and conditioning upon, a variable of the risk a
country has of having high sugar availability (a first step bivariate
probit model known as a ‘‘Heckman-type’’ selection model, see
Text S1). Once we added controls for potential selection bias
associated with high sugar availability, the association of sugar
availability with diabetes prevalence magnified to 1.2% rise in
diabetes prevalence for each 150 kcal/person/day increase in
sugar availability (p,0.001). The coefficient on the variable for the
risk of high sugar availability was non-significant, suggesting that
selection bias was unlikely to impact our results.

Discussion

results

show that

The worldwide secular trend of increased diabetes prevalence
likely has multiple etiologies, which may act through multiple
mechanisms. Our
sugar availability is a
significant statistical determinant of diabetes prevalence rates
worldwide. By statistically studying variation in diabetes rates, food
availability data and associated socioeconomic and demographic
variables across countries and time, we identified that sugar
availability appears
to be uniquely correlated to diabetes
prevalence independent of overweight and obesity prevalence
rates, unlike other
food types and total consumption, and
independent of other changes in economic and social change
such as urbanization, aging, changes
to household income,
sedentary lifestyles and tobacco or alcohol use. We found that
obesity appeared to exacerbate, but not confound, the impact of
sugar availability on diabetes prevalence,
strengthening the
argument for targeted public health approaches to excessive sugar
consumption. We also noted that longer exposure to high sugar
was associated with accentuated diabetes prevalence, while
reduced sugar exposure was associated with decline in diabetes
prevalence, and that the sugar-diabetes relationship appeared to
meet criteria for temporal causality without being the result of
selection biases or the effect of secular trends that may be artifacts
of economic development or changes in surveillance.

identify what

Despite the robustness of our findings to a broad set of
socioeconomic and epidemiologic variables,
there are several
important limitations to this analysis. First, as with all cross-
country analyses, the potential exists for ecological fallacies. The
observed associations are biologically plausible, given the numer-
ous mechanisms by which sugar
foments pathophysiologic
processes leading to diabetes [19,40]. They are also complemented
by individual data, but unfortunately such individual analyses
cannot
factors are most prominently affecting
diabetes rates at the population level in the setting of multiple
other concurrent economic and social changes. Hence, we add
value to the discussion about diabetes prevention strategies by
conducting an ecological statistical analysis that
incorporates
broad social change variables to assess the international signifi-
cance of recent laboratory and clinical studies. An ecological
analysis at a population level can also help decipher drivers of
change from small associations found at the individual level. As an
example, while not wearing bicycle helmets is found to be an
important risk factor for traumatic brain injury in cohort studies, it
is not an important driver of all traumatic brain injuries in general
at a population level, since the latter is dominated by motor vehicle
accidents. Similarly,
in our analysis, many foods did not have
significant correlations to diabetes prevalence at the population
level, even though they are associated with diabetes in cohort or

clinical trial studies. This is because at a population level the
significance of these other foods may be not be driving population-
level diabetes rates. Our population-level data do not allow us to
assert mechanistic understandings of relationships between risk
and outcome, but do afford us a sense that the effect size is large
enough to affect the population rates of disease.

Second, we utilized an international food database that tracks
caloric availability, as there are no direct measures of actual
human consumption that can account
for food wastage and
provide precise measures of
food consumption internationally.
Exclusion of the United States from the data—an outlier-country
in terms of food wastage—did not change our results. In other
countries, supply and consumption are more closely aligned [41],
and differential wastage among foodstuffs does not appear to occur
[42]. Another potential limitation is that we cannot track specific
foods with accuracy, hence further analyses should investigate and
differentiate different types of sugars, or foods like dairy products,
to which sugars are frequently added, as well as other nutritional
components such as proteins and fats. For instance, a recent
ecological analysis correlated high-fructose corn syrup with
diabetes prevalence [43]. Our assessment was also ecological in
nature and cannot identify specific longitudinal causation among
individuals; however, unlike the prior assessment, the correlations
detected here were subjected to several tests to assess relationships
across time, the potential effects of other foodstuffs, the potential
for selection biases, and a larger number of potential confounding
factors.

Third, while considerable debate exists as to what forms of
sugar may be most relevant to this relationship (for example,
whether high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) is different than sucrose
[44]), our analysis cannot distinguish between any specific added
sugars, such as HFCS or sucrose, or between any specific vehicle,
such as soda or processed food. Our study merely suggests that the
aggregate indicator of added sugar availability statistically predicts
changes in diabetes prevalence over time.

Fourth, our ecological approach limits statistical power as one
makes inferences about individuals based on aggregates; age, sex,

and racial predictions are lost. Important work at the individual
level suggests that certain populations, such as South Asian groups,
may develop metabolic syndrome and diabetes at lower levels of
obesity as assessed by BMI than other populations such as
Caucasians. Environmental
factors such as sugar consumption
should be investigated as potential factors in this interaction. A
BMI . 25 kg/m2 rather than 30 kg/m2 may a more appropriate
indicator of obesity in Asians. Substituting overweight for obesity
in the models did not change the effect size or significance of our
findings with regard to sugar, and high sugars with low obesity
rates were observed in countries outside of East and South Asia,
suggesting that ethnic factors alone are unlikely to explain our
observations. Other societal factors associated with diabetes were
those classically associated with metabolic syndrome;
including
income, urbanization and aging. All three of these were associated
with dietary and physical activity changes.

Finally, the International Diabetes Federation database contains
diabetes prevalence data based on multiple surveys of varying
quality; as many diabetics go undiagnosed,
these are likely
underestimates, and do not distinguish between Type 1 (approx-
imately 10%) and Type 2 diabetes (90%), which would tend to
produce regression towards
the mean (underestimating the
relationship between sugar and diabetes). Furthermore, we used
the best available population-wide international data available to
date for this assessment, but these data are known to be highly
imperfect. It is thought that much of the FAO data on foods and
nutrients in the food supply have limits to their reliability, and that
IDF data and WHO data on obesity prevalence are difficult to
validate independently. Hence, any of the findings we observe here
are meant to be exploratory in nature, helping us to detect broad
population patterns that deserve further testing through prospec-
tive longitudinal cohort studies in international settings, which are
only now coming underway.

The observed relationship between dietary sugar exposure and
statistical assessment was not mitigated by
diabetes
adjusting for confounders
related to socioeconomics, aging,
physical activity, or obesity. This suggests that sugar should be

investigated for its role in diabetes pathogenesis apart from its
contributions to obesity.

In summary, population-level variations in diabetes prevalence
that are unexplained by other common variables appear to be
statistically explained by sugar. This finding lends credence to the
notion that further investigations into sugar availability and/or
consumption are warranted to further elucidate the pathogenesis
of diabetes at an individual level and the drivers of diabetes at a
population level [13].

Systematic review and meta-analysis of different dietary approaches
to the management of type 2 diabetes1–3

Olubukola Ajala, Patrick English, and Jonathan Pinkney

ABSTRACT
Background: There is evidence that reducing blood glucose con-
centrations, inducing weight loss, and improving the lipid proﬁle
reduces cardiovascular risk in people with type 2 diabetes.
Objective: We assessed the effect of various diets on glycemic
control, lipids, and weight loss.
Design: We conducted searches of PubMed, Embase, and Google
Scholar to August 2011. We included randomized controlled trials
(RCTs) with interventions that lasted $6 mo that compared low-
carbohydrate, vegetarian, vegan, low–glycemic index (GI), high-
ﬁber, Mediterranean, and high-protein diets with control diets
including low-fat, high-GI, American Diabetes Association, Euro-
pean Association for the Study of Diabetes, and low-protein diets.
Results: A total of 20 RCTs were included (n = 3073 included in
ﬁnal analyses across 3460 randomly assigned individuals). The low-
carbohydrate, low-GI, Mediterranean, and high-protein diets all led
to a greater improvement in glycemic control [glycated hemoglobin
reductions of 20.12% (P = 0.04), 20.14% (P = 0.008), 20.47% (P
, 0.00001), and 20.28% (P , 0.00001), respectively] compared
with their respective control diets, with the largest effect size seen in
the Mediterranean diet. Low-carbohydrate and Mediterranean diets
led to greater weight loss [20.69 kg (P = 0.21) and 21.84 kg (P ,
0.00001), respectively], with an increase in HDL seen in all diets
except the high-protein diet.
Conclusion: Low-carbohydrate, low-GI, Mediterranean, and high-
protein diets are effective in improving various markers of cardio-
vascular risk in people with diabetes and should be considered in the
Am J Clin Nutr
overall strategy of diabetes management.

INTRODUCTION

There is good evidence that complex interventions, including
dietary changes, can prevent the progression of impaired glucose
tolerance to diabetes (1, 2). However, there is limited evidence on
the optimal dietary approach to control hyperglycemia in type 2
diabetes (T2D)4. It is clear that weight loss and reduced total
calorie intake are important in the obtainment of good glycemic
control (3–7), but the ideal proportion of the 3 main food
components (carbohydrate, fat, and protein) that should be
recommended remains unclear.

Several trials (8–10) have documented the potential beneﬁts
of carbohydrate restriction and low–glycemic index (GI) and
Mediterranean diets on glycemic control and weight loss that
are maintained long term (9, 11–14).

Epidemiologic data showed a relation between a high intake
of saturated fat and raised glycated hemoglobin (Hb A1c) (15),
but randomized studies have failed to corroborate these ﬁndings
(3–8). Systematic reviews and meta-analyses have shown that low-
GI, high-ﬁber, and Mediterranean diets improve glucose metabo-
lism (16–18).

The British Diabetes Association, European Association for
the Study of Diabetes (EASD), American Diabetes Association
(ADA), American Heart Association, Canadian Diabetes Asso-
ciation, International College of Nutrition, groups from South
Africa and Japan, and the National Cholesterol Education Panel
(Adult Treatment Panel 3) (19–27) have various recommenda-
tions for the optimal diet in people with T2D (summarized in
Table 1). Most of these authorities recommend a carbohydrate
intake of 50–60% of total energy intake, total fat intake #30%
of energy (with moderate polyunsaturated fat and restriction of
saturated and trans fat intake). However, there is insufﬁcient
evidence to justify these recommendations. To our knowledge,
there is no systematic review or meta-analysis that has compared
the effects of different categories of dietary intervention on
glycemic control, weight loss, and lipids in T2D. This system-
atic review was conducted to provide a succinct but robust ev-
idence base to guide clinicians and patients on the most suitable
dietary intervention to induce weight loss and improve glycemic
control and the lipid proﬁle.

meta-analyses were undertaken up to July 2011. References of
included studies and key review and guideline reports were
checked for additional studies. Key search terms included di-
abetic, atherogenic, carbohydrate restricted, low carbohydrate,
ketogenic, fat restricted, low fat, Mediterranean, protein re-
stricted,
low protein, vegetarian, and glycemic index (GI).
Studies were considered eligible for inclusion if they were RCTs
carried out in adults ($18 y of age) with an intervention that
lasted $6 mo that compared low- and high-carbohydrate, high-
protein, vegetarian and vegan, low-glycemic, high-ﬁber, and
Mediterranean diets with any control diet in people with T2D.

Outcome measures

Outcomes of interest were Hb A1c, which was used as the
measure of glycemic control, difference in weight lost, and
changes in HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides.

Quality measures

The quality of each included trial was assessed based on
speciﬁc criteria outlined in the Cochrane handbook for systematic
reviews of interventions and included minimization of selection
bias, attrition bias, detection bias, reporting bias and blinding of
outcome assessment (Figure 1; see “Supplemental data” in the
online issue).

Statistical analysis

A meta-analysis was undertaken for each dietary-intervention
subgroup when appropriate (16 of 20 trials) with Revman 5
software (Cochrane Information Management System) when data
were available for more than one trial and were of sufﬁcient
quality. The ﬁxed-effect inverse-variance model was used to
calculate the weighted mean difference (WMD) and was expressed
in terms of the 95% CI and level of statistical signiﬁcance. Out-
comes were extracted by comparing means of the intervention
compared with control diets and the SEM at follow-up.

RESULTS

Study selection

A total of 1801 records were identiﬁed from the initial elec-
tronic search, with an additional 64 records from other sources
(references of reviews and other articles). From the abstracts of
these records, we identiﬁed 55 articles for examination of full
texts. Thirty-ﬁve studies were excluded either because the in-
tervention lasted ,6 mo or the studies were not randomized
trials (Figure 2).

Studies were excluded from the meta-analysis but included in
the results section (Table 2) if required data were not available
or provided after correspondence from the authors (28), if only
one study was available in that subgroup that made comparisons
impossible (5, 29, 30), and if the study was carried out in both
patients with diabetes and nonpatients with diabetes with sepa-
rate data not available for the diabetic group (31). One study
(32) had separate data for change in Hb A1c in patients with di-
abetes, ant thus, this outcome was included in the meta-analysis;
another study (33) was included in the quantitative analysis

terranean diets (compared with a low-carbohydrate Mediterra-
nean diet) (7, 8, 32, 37, 38, 43). Four studies (31, 35–37)
compared Mediterranean diets with low fat and the ADA diet,
3 studies (34, 38, 39) compared a low-GI diet with the ADA,
high-GI, and high-ﬁber diets, respectively, and 2 studies (40,
44) compared a high-protein diet with low-protein and high-
carbohydrate diets, respectively. Other studies compared vegan
with ADA diets (29), vegetarian with EASD diets (30), high-
carbohydrate with high-MUFA diets (5), and high-ﬁber with
low-fat diets (28). Control diets are described in more detail in
Table 2 (summary of trials).

despite not having separate data for the diabetic group because
.80% of the study population had diabetes.

The 16 studies included in the quantitative analysis were RCTs
with dietary interventions that ranged from 6 mo (30, 32, 34, 35,
42) to 4 y (36). Two of the studies included in the meta-analysis
compared 3 separate diets (37, 38). These arms were treated in
isolation. Wolever et al (38) compared a low-GI diet compared
with a high-GI diet compared with a low-carbohydrate diet. The
low-carbohydrate arm was compared with the low-GI arm and
labeled Wolever-1, whereas the low-GI arm was compared with
high-GI arm and labeled Wolever-2. Elhayany et al (37) com-
pared a low-carbohydrate Mediterranean diet compared with
a traditional Mediterranean diet compared with an ADA diet, and
thus, the low-carbohydrate Mediterranean arm was compared
with the traditional Mediterranean arm in the subgroup “low-
carbohydrate compared with other diets.” This comparison was
labeled Elhayany-1. The traditional Mediterranean diet was
compared with the ADA diet in the “Mediterranean compared
with other diets” subgroup, and this comparison was labeled
Elhayany-2.

Quality of studies

None of the included trials reported any signiﬁcant differences
in characteristics of participants in the intervention or treatment
arm. Except for 3 studies (8, 35, 37), all other studies reported the
method of random assignment, 10 studies reported the method
of allocation concealment, and 6 studies were analyzed on an
intention-to-treat basis (7, 32, 34, 36, 39, 40).

Participants

The 20 studies included 3460 patients with ﬁnal analyses in
3073 patients. Four of the studies (31–33, 41) included patients
with and without diabetes, and one of these studies (32) pro-
vided data on the change in glycemic control in the diabetic
group, and another study (33) was included in quantitative
analysis despite not having separate data for the diabetic group
because .80% of the study population had diabetes. All par-
ticipants were $18 y old, and all but one study (35) included
both sexes.

Intervention

Nine studies compared a low-carbohydrate diet to a variety of
control diets including low-fat, low-GI, and traditional Medi-

Meta-analyses

Glycemic control

Low-carbohydrate compared with other diets (Figure 3).
Data from 8 studies (7, 8, 32, 33, 38, 39, 43, 44) were pooled
and compared low-carbohydrate with a variety of control diets.
There was a signiﬁcant decrease in the percentage of Hb A1c
in subjects who consumed low-carbohydrate compared with
other diets (WMD: 20.12%; 95% CI: 20.24%, 20.00%; P =
0.04, I2 = 75%).

Low-GI compared with other diets. Data from the 3 studies that
compared low-GI with other diets (34, 38, 39) showed a 20.14%
decrease in Hb A1c in subjects who consumed low-GI compared
with control diets (95% CI: 20.23%, 20.03%; P = 0.008, I2 =
80%).

Mediterranean compared with other diets. The 3 studies that
compared Mediterranean with other diets (35–37) showed
a WMD in Hb A1c of 20.47% in favor of the Mediterranean diet
(95% CI: 20.64%, 20.30%; P , 0.00001, I2 = 82%).

High-protein compared with other diets. Data pooled from
2 studies that compared high-protein with other diets (40, 44)
showed a signiﬁcant decrease in the percentage of Hb A1c in
subjects who consumed high-protein diets (WMD: 20.28%;
95% CI: 20.38%, 20.18%; P , 0.00001, I2 = 60%).

Weight loss

Low-carbohydrate compared with other diets. There was no
signiﬁcant difference in weight loss when low-carbohydrate diets
were compared with control diets (WMD: 20.69 kg; 95% CI:
21.77, 0.39 kg; P = 0.21).

Low-GI compared with other diets. There was no signiﬁcant
difference in weight loss with low-GI compared with control diets
(+1.39 kg; 95% CI: 21.58, 4.36 kg; P = 0.36).

Mediterranean compared with other diets. The Mediterranean
diet was more effective in achieving weight loss that control diets
were with a WMD in weight loss of 21.84 kg (95% CI: 2.54,
21.15 kg; P , 0.00001).

High-protein compared with other diets. Data pooled from 2
studies showed no beneﬁt of high-protein diet compared with
control diets for achieving weight loss (WMD: +0.44 kg; 95% CI:
–0.96, 1.84; P = 0.54).

Change in lipids

Low-carbohydrate compared with other diets. Low-carbohydrate
diets appeared to be beneﬁcial in increasing HDL (WMD +0.08
mmol/L; 95% CI: 0.05, 0.11 mmol/L; P , 0.00001) with no
signiﬁcant reduction in LDL (WMD: 20.03 mmol/L; 95% CI:
20.12, 0.07 mmol/L; P = 0.57) or triglycerides (WMD: 20.04
mmol/L; 95% CI: 20.15, 0.07 mmol/L; P = 0.47).

Low-GI compared with other diets. Low-GI diets were ef-
fective in increasing HDL (WMD: +0.05 mmol/L, 95% CI: 0.02,
0.07 mmol/L; P , 0.0001), but the reductions in LDL and tri-
glycerides were not signiﬁcant compared with those for control
diets (for low-GI diets, WMD: 20.07 mmol/L; 95% CI: 20.16,
0.02 mmol/L; P = 0.15; for control diets, WMD: 20.01 mmol/L;
95% CI: 20.04, 0.03 mmol/L; P = 0.69).

Mediterranean compared with other diets. The Mediterranean
diet signiﬁcantly reduced triglycerides (WMD: 20.21 mmol/L;
95% CI: 20.29, 20.14 mmol/L; P , 0.00001) and increased

HDL (WMD: +0.04 mmol/L; 95% CI: 0.01, 0.07 mmol/L; P =
0.004). One of the 3 studies did not provide data on the change
in LDL cholesterol (49), but pooled data from the other studies
showed no signiﬁcant reduction in LDL (WMD: 20.08 mmol/L;
95% CI; 20.24, 0.08 mmol/L; P = 0.34).

High-protein compared with other diets. High-protein diets
had no effects on markers of the lipid proﬁle (LDL WMD: 20.16
mmol/L; 95% CI: 20.41, 0.09 mmol/L; P = 0.22; triglyceride
WMD: 20.11 mmol/L; 95% CI: 20.56, 0.33 mmol/L; P = 0.61;
HDL WMD: +0.01 mmol/L; 95% CI: 20.08, 0.10 mmol/L;
P = 0.89).

Studies excluded from meta-analyses

Six studies were excluded from meta-analyses; 4 of these
studies had no other studies for comparison within their subgroup
(5, 28–30), and 2 studies included participants with and without
diabetes with no separate data provided for subjects with di-
abetes (31, 41).

Barnard et al (36) compared a vegan diet with the low-fat ADA
diet and showed a signiﬁcantly greater reduction in total cho-
lesterol, LDL, and Hb A1c in the vegan group after 74 wk. A
similar-sized study (30) that compared a vegetarian diet with the
EASD diet showed greater weight
loss and reduced re-
quirements for diabetes medication in the vegetarian arm. No
signiﬁcant beneﬁt was shown in studies that compared high-
carbohydrate with high-MUFA diets (5) and high-ﬁber with low-
fat diets (28).

Yancy et al (32) compared a low-carbohydrate diet with a low-
fat diet in 146 patients, 45 of whom had diabetes. There was no
signiﬁcant difference in the amount of weight loss or glycemic
control in the whole group (41). Salas-Salvado´ et al (31)
compared 2 variations of the Mediterranean diet with a low-fat
diet in 1224 participants with high cardiovascular risk. Ap-
proximately two-thirds of participants had diabetes, and the
major signiﬁcant ﬁnding was a greater reduction in triglycerides
in the group who consumed the Mediterranean diet with nut
supplementation.

DISCUSSION

This review provides evidence that modifying the amount of
macronutrients can improve glycemic control, weight, and lipids
in people with diabetes. Low-carbohydrate, low-GI, Mediterra-
nean, and high-protein diets reduced Hb A1c by 0.12–0.5%
compared with comparison or control diets. These Hb A1c re-
ductions were signiﬁcant, with a reduction of 0.5% that was
similar to that achieved by using medication (44, 45) and as-
sociated with lower risk of microvascular complications (46).

Low-carbohydrate, low-GI ,and Mediterranean diets led to
signiﬁcant improvements in the lipid proﬁle with up to a 4–10%
increase in HDL (4% in Mediterranean, 5% in low-GI, and 10%
in low-carbohydrate diets), 1–4% reduction in LDL (1% in low-
carbohydrate, 3% in low-GI, and 4% in Mediterranean diets),
and 9% reduction in triglycerides.

Low-carbohydrate diets restrict carbohydrate intake to 20–60
g/d. The studies in this review compared diets low in carbohy-
drates with low-fat and low-GI diets. The low-carbohydrate diets
appeared to provide superior weight loss, glycemic control, and
lipid proﬁle compared with low-fat diets and, in one of 2 studies
(42), was superior to the low-GI diet for all 3 variables. How-

ever, the carbohydrate content of these diets was as low as 20g
carbohydrates/d and ranged from 13–45% of the daily energy
intake. In contrast, international authorities recommend a car-
bohydrate intake from 45 to .65% of total energy/d.

A recently published review by Wheeler et al (47) that looked
at literature between 2001 and 2010 also showed that low-
carbohydrate diets appeared to improve markers of glycemic control
with nonsigniﬁcant improvements in lipoproteins.

A vegetarian diet includes mainly cereal products, nuts, seeds,
fruit, and vegetables and, occasionally, dairy products and eggs.
Vegans avoid dairy products, eggs, or any other foods derived
from animals.

The study that compared a vegan diet to the low-fat ADA diet
showed signiﬁcantly lower total cholesterol, LDL, and Hb A1c in
the vegan arm (29). These differences were attributed to the
weight-loss effect of the diet. Additional analysis at 18 mo (29)
showed an advantage of vegetarian diets in terms of glycemic
control and lipid proﬁle but not in weight loss (48).

Kahleova et al (30) randomly assigned a similar number of
participants to receive either a vegetarian or EASD diet and
showed signiﬁcant reductions in diabetes medication, greater
weight loss, and increased insulin sensitivity in the vegetarian
arm but no signiﬁcant difference in Hb A1c.

Therefore, there is a suggestion that vegan and vegetarian diets
might be beneﬁcial in improving glycemic control and inducing
weight loss. However, there is a need for more studies to support
the wider use of these diets in people with diabetes.

The GI is a way of ranking foods according to their glycemic
effect. It is deﬁned as the area under the 2-hour blood glucose
response curve (AUC) after the ingestion of 50 g carbohydrates.
The AUC of the test food is divided by the AUC of the standard
(usually glucose or white bread) and multiplied by 100 (49, 50).
The deﬁnition of low GI in these trials was variable. Ma et al (39)
deﬁned low GI as “choosing predominantly low-GI foods,” which
translated to foods that had, on average, a 3-point lower GI than
those in the control arm (the ADA diet); in the study of Wolever
et al (38), the low-GI group had 8% less high-GI foods than the
high-GI group did, whereas the low-GI group in the study of
Jenkins et al (34) consisted of foods with a GI that was, on av-
erage, 14 points less than in the control arm (high-ﬁber diet).

Low-GI diets resulted in a lower Hb A1c and higher HDL but
no signiﬁcant difference in weight loss (34, 38, 39). The Hb A1c
reduction was only 0.14% and might not have been clinically
relevant.

Anderson et al (51) performed a meta-analysis that compared
low-GI with high-GI diets and showed signiﬁcant beneﬁts in
terms of glycemic control and lipid proﬁle. However, these
studies included subjects those with type 1 diabetes and children
and enrolled a mean of just 14 participants for an average of 33 d
per trial, which made it difﬁcult to extrapolate the ﬁndings to
the prevalently older T2D population and made it impossible to
predict if these beneﬁts would be sustained over time. The
ﬁndings of Wheeler et al (47) were similar to ours with only little
differences in glycemic control between low- and high-GI and
other diets.

The Mediterranean diet is rich in olive oil, legumes, unreﬁned
cereals, fruit, and vegetables, low in meat and meat products, and
with moderate contents of dairy products (mostly cheese and
yogurt), ﬁsh, and wine. The total fat in this diet is typically 25–
35% of calories, with saturated fat at #8% of calories (52, 53).

AJALA ET AL

The 3 trials included in the meta-analysis compared a Medi-
terranean diet with a conventional diet (ie, no change to the current
diets of participants) and ADA diet (35–37) and showed better
glycemic control, greater weight loss, and a more-favorable lipid
proﬁle in the Mediterranean-diet arm.

An important difference between the Mediterranean and ADA
diets is likely to be the content of MUFAs, which has been shown
to have an impact on the lipd proﬁle (54, 55), insulin sensitivity
(56–58), and postprandial glucose concentrations (59). Our
conclusion regarding the Mediterranean diet is similar to that in
a review by Esposito et al (60), which showed improved gly-
cemic control, and Kastorini et al (61), whose meta-analysis
showed an association between the Mediterranean diet and im-
proved lipid proﬁle and lower blood glucose.

High-protein diets are diets in which 20–30% or more of the
total daily calories come from proteins (62). Of 2 studies, one
study compared a high-protein diet with a low-protein diet (44),
and the other study compared a high-protein diet with a high-
carbohydrate diet (40). Neither study showed any signiﬁcant
differences in weight, glycemic control, or lipids, but pooled
data showed signiﬁcantly lower Hb A1c concentrations in the
high-protein–diet group. This impact on glycemic control might
have been due to previous suggestions that protein has effects on
appetite suppression (63) and insulin sensitivity (64–68). The
concern of the development of diabetic nephropathy (69) with
a high-protein diet was not substantiated by Brinkworth et al
(44) who showed no change in urinary albumin excretion in
either the high- or low-protein–diet arms. These data suggest
a possible role for high-protein diets, but additional studies are
probably required to examine the long-term effects in patients
with renal disease.

The studies that compared a diet high in carbohydrates to one
high in MUFAs and high-ﬁber with low-fat diets showed no
signiﬁcant differences in weight, glycemic control, and lipid
proﬁle (5, 28).

There are signiﬁcant confounders in performing a meta-
analysis of such varied interventions. The control diets were
different in terms of the speciﬁc macronutrient composition,
study participants sometimes had different baseline character-
istics (eg, weight and Hb A1c), the duration of the studies ranged
between 6 mo and 4 y (although we performed the meta-analysis
by using data at 6 mo or 1 y), and, although all studies included
in the meta-analysis were RCTs, some studies failed to report on
allocation concealment and assessor blinding. Thus, all of these
features introduced heterogeneity and confounding effects in the
analysis. Additional research should involve large trials that
compared all of these diets in participants with similar charac-
teristics for the same duration. The favorable results from the
Mediterranean and high-protein categories should be interpreted
with caution, particularly because few studies were analyzed.

Another major confounder was the independent effect of
weight change on the other measured variables (glycemic control
and lipid proﬁle). It is difﬁcult to isolate the effect of weight
change on these markers of cardiovascular risk, and thus, these
beneﬁts could be falsely attributed to the change in quantity of
a macronutrient when the change was due to the impact of weight
loss alone. This possibility might be of particular relevance when
the effect of low-carbohydrate diets is interpreted. Future studies
that aim to keep weight constant or ensure an equal caloric intake
in all study arms would be useful to help clarify this issue.

In conclusion, our review of the existing literature on low-
carbohydrate, low-GI, Mediterranean, and high-protein diets
suggests that these diets may be effective in improving various
markers of cardiovascular risk in people with diabetes and
could have a wider role in the management of diabetes. Dietary
behaviors and choices are often personal, and it is usually more
realistic for a dietary modiﬁcation to be individualized rather
than to use a one-size-ﬁts-all approach for each person. The
diets reviewed in this study show that there may be a range of
beneﬁcial dietary options for people with T2D.

Abstract

Low-glycemic index (GI) foods and foods rich in whole grain are associated with reduced risk of type 2 diabetes and

cardiovascular disease. We studied the effect of cereal-based bread evening meals (50 g available starch), varying in GI and

content of indigestible carbohydrates, on glucose tolerance and related variables after a subsequent standardized
breakfast in healthy subjects (n ¼ 15). At breakfast, blood was sampled for 3 h for analysis of blood glucose, serum insulin,
serum FFA, serum triacylglycerides, plasma glucagon, plasma gastric-inhibitory peptide, plasma glucagon-like peptide-

1 (GLP-1), serum interleukin (IL)-6, serum IL-8, and plasma adiponectin. Satiety was subjectively rated after breakfast and

the gastric emptying rate (GER) was determined using paracetamol as a marker. Breath hydrogen was measured as an

indicator of colonic fermentation. Evening meals with barley kernel based bread (ordinary, high-amylose- or b-glucan-rich

genotypes) or an evening meal with white wheat ﬂour bread (WWB) enriched with a mixture of barley ﬁber and resistant

starch improved glucose tolerance at the subsequent breakfast compared with unsupplemented WWB (P , 0.05). At
breakfast, the glucose response was inversely correlated with colonic fermentation (r ¼ 20.25; P , 0.05) and GLP-1
(r ¼ 20.26; P , 0.05) and positively correlated with FFA (r ¼ 0.37; P , 0.001). IL-6 was lower (P , 0.01) and adiponectin
was higher (P , 0.05) at breakfast following an evening meal with barley-kernel bread compared with WWB. Breath
hydrogen correlated positively with satiety (r ¼ 0.27; P , 0.01) and inversely with GER (r ¼ 20.23; P , 0.05). In conclusion,
the composition of indigestible carbohydrates of the evening meal may affect glycemic excursions and related metabolic

risk variables at breakfast through a mechanism involving colonic fermentation. The results provide evidence for a link

between gut microbial metabolism and key factors associated with insulin resistance. J. Nutr. 138: 732–739, 2008.

and cardiovascular disease (1–4). Similarly, preventive effects
adjunct to development of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular
disease, and obesity are also reported from observational studies
with foods rich in whole grain (5,6). It could therefore be
hypothesized that low-GI foods, which in addition are rich in
whole-grain constituents, could be particularly advantageous.
The mechanisms underlying the beneﬁcial effects of low-GI and
whole-grain foods are, however, not completely explained. It is
known that hyperglycemia, and probably also elevated levels of
FFA, induce increased concentrations of reactive oxygen and
nitrogen species (7). Oxidative stress is probably a key mediator
of increased cytokine concentrations and low grade systemic
inﬂammation (8), suggesting a role in the genesis of vascular
damage (9), and a possible mechanism underlying the patho-
physiology of
type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease
(7,10,11). It could be hypothesized that a low-GI diet decreases
oxidative stress and lower inﬂammation by maintaining a more
tight blood glucose regulation.

In addition to lowering the acute blood glucose response,
several studies show that most low-GI foods consumed at
breakfast may lower glycemia at a ‘‘second-meal’’ standardized
lunch after 4 h (12),
indicating improvements on glycemic
regulation, insulin sensitivity, and/or insulin economy also within
a semiacute time frame. Beneﬁts on glycemic excursions are also
reported with certain low-GI products in the perspective from a
late evening meal to a subsequent standardized breakfast (13,14).
However, within this longer time frame, low-GI features per se
were not sufﬁcient to achieve a second-meal effect on glucose
tolerance. Instead, low-GI foods that were also rich in indigest-
ible carbohydrates induced beneﬁts to glucose tolerance in an
overnight perspective. Accordingly, it appears plausible that the
second-meal effect on glucose tolerance may be mediated
through different mechanisms depending on the in-between
meal time period both with respect to the food factors and the
physiological mechanisms involved.

thus enabling production of

The aim of this work was to study the potential importance of
GI and indigestible carbohydrates [dietary ﬁber (DF) and resistant
starch (RS)] of tailored whole-grain evening meals on glucose
tolerance the subsequent morning and to study possible physio-
logical mechanisms underlying the improved glucose regulation in
this longer period of time (10.5 h). For this purpose, barley
varieties differing in contents of DF or amylose:amylopectin ratio
were used in baking kernel-based bread (whole- or cut cereal
kernels),
low-GI barley bread
products differing in the amount and distribution of DF and RS.
A white wheat bread (WWB) was used as a reference evening meal
and a WWB meal enriched with barley DF and RS, or RS only,
were included as controls (high-GI products). Healthy subjects
ingested carbohydrate-equivalent evening test meals and blood
was sampled prior to and following a standardized breakfast to
measure blood glucose, serum insulin, plasma glucagon, serum
lipids (FFA and triacylglycerides), plasma incretins [glucagon-like
peptide-1 (GLP-1) and gastric-inhibitory peptide (GIP)], plasma
adiponectin, and markers of inﬂammation [interleukin (IL)-6 and
IL-8]. Breath hydrogen was measured as an indicator of colonic
fermentation and gastric emptying rate (GER) was measured using
serum paracetamol as a marker. Finally, subjective rating of satiety
was measured after the standardized breakfast.

Materials and Methods

Test subjects
Healthy volunteers, 6 women and 11 men, aged 22 – 32 y (mean 6 SD ¼
25.9 6 3.2 y) with normal BMI (mean 6 SD ¼ 22.5 6 2.1 kg/m2)
participated in the study. Subjects were recruited by e-mail or telephone
calls to people who were previously involved in similar studies or friends
of such persons that asked to be included in the study. The subjects were
carefully informed that they could quit the experiment at any time,
without feeling forced to give any explanation. One male was excluded
because the breakfast bread made him nauseous and 1 woman dropped
out due to gastrointestinal symptoms. A total of 15 subjects completed
the study. Approval of the study was given by the Regional Ethical
Review Board in Lund, Sweden.

Evening test meals and the standardized breakfast
Eight cereal-based test meals with different GI and contents of
indigestible carbohydrates were included in the study (Tables 1 and 2).
The test meals consisted of bread with the main proportion of
carbohydrates derived from: white wheat ﬂour (WWB; reference prod-
uct), ordinary barley kernels (OB; unspeciﬁed ordinary Swedish barley
provided by Lantma¨ nnen Food), OB that were cut 1–2 times (CutOB),
kernels from a barley variety with elevated amounts of amylose yielding
increased levels of RS in the ﬁnished product (HAB; 31% RS; starch
basis, Karmose´, Svalo¨ f Weibull), kernels from a barley variety with

(WWB1RS; Hi-maize 1043, Biomin), or WWB added with the same
amount of RS and also with DF from barley (WWB1RS1DF; Lyckeby
Sta¨ rkelsen) to match the content of indigestible carbohydrates in the OB
product. To investigate a possible dose-response effect, 1 test meal
consisted of a one-half portion of OB bread (1/2OB bread). The size of
all test meals (except for 1/2OB) corresponded to 50 g available
carbohydrates, calculated by subtracting RS (15) from the total starch
content (16). White wheat ﬂour was added to the cereal kernel breads in
proportions (weight percent) of 10:90 white wheat ﬂour:kernels. Water
(unlimited amounts) was consumed with the test evening meals.

The standardized breakfast consisted of 116.7 g WWB, correspond-
ing to 50 g available starch. The bread was baked similarly to the WWB
reference bread described in the next paragraph, except that 8.25 g
paracetamol was added to each bread. The paracetamol was included in
the bread (1 g per portion) as a tool to measure the GER. Water (250 mL)
was served with the standardized breakfast meal.

Recipes
WWB. The WWB was baked according to a standardized procedure in a
home baking machine (Severin model no. BM 3983; Menu choice,
program 2 [white bread, 1000 g, quick (time: 2:35)]. The bread was
made from 540 g white wheat ﬂour (Kungso¨ rnen), 360 g water, 4.8 g dry
yeast, and 4.8 g salt.

OB bread. A total of 630 g OB was boiled in 550 g water for 12 min and
was then cooled for 30 min in ambient temperature. All water was

absorbed into the kernels when cooked. Added to the kernels were: 70 g
white wheat ﬂour, 12 g dry yeast, 5 g salt, and 240 g water. The dough
was kneaded for 4 min (Electrolux AKM 3110n N 25) and proofed for
30 min in the dough mixing bowl, followed by another prooﬁng (35 min)
in a baking tin. Bread was baked in a household oven at 200°C for 40
min, covered with aluminum foil during the last 20 min.

CutOB bread. A total of 630 g CutOB kernels was boiled in 650 g water
for 10 min. The other ingredients, prooﬁng, and baking procedure were
similar to the OB bread.

HAB bread. The recipe was similar to the OB bread, except the amount
of water added to the dough was 190 g.

HBB bread. A total of 630 g kernels was boiled in 550 g water for 10
min. The other ingredients, prooﬁng, and baking were similar to the OB
bread.

WWB1RS1DF. The bread was made from 465 g white wheat ﬂour,
100 g High-maize starch, 125 g barley DF extract, 5 g salt, 5 g yeast, and
650 g water. The dry ingredients were mixed with the water in the dough
mixing bowl (Electrolux AKM 3110n N 25) and kneaded for 6 min. The
dough was proofed for 30 min in the dough mixing bowl, kneaded for
2 min, and proofed again (45 min) in a baking tin. Bread was baked at
225°C for 45 min.

WWB1RS. The bread was made of 490 g white wheat ﬂour, 100 g High-
maize starch, 5 g salt, 5 g yeast, and 400 g water. The bread was baked as
described for the WWB.

After cooling, the crusts were removed and the breads were sliced and
wrapped in aluminum foil in portion sizes, put into plastic bags, and
stored in a freezer (220°C). Bread slices consumed in the evening were
removed from the freezer in the morning and thawed at an ambient
temperature in their aluminum foil and plastic bag wrapping.

Chemical analyses and GI characteristics of the test products
The test products were analyzed with respect to total starch (16), RS
(15), and DF (soluble and insoluble) (17). Before analysis of total starch
and DF, the bread products were air dried and milled (Cyclotec, Foss
Tecator). RS in all test products were analyzed on products as eaten. The
available starch content was calculated by subtracting RS from total
starch. The GI of the products were predicted from hydrolysis indices
using an in vitro method (18) and GI calculated from a modiﬁed
equation: GI ¼ 6.272 1 0.912 3 hydrolysis indices (19).

Experimental design
Procedure. The subjects were encouraged to standardize their meal
pattern and avoid foods rich in DF the day prior to each experimental
day. Furthermore, they should avoid alcohol and excessive physical
exercise in the evening and should not have consumed antibiotics or
probiotics during the previous 2 wk. The subjects participated approx-
imately once per week and the test meals were consumed in a random
order. Subjects consumed the test meals at 2130 and then fasted until the
standardized breakfast. The subjects arrived at
the experimental
department at 0745 the next morning. An i.v. cannula (BD Venﬂon,
Becton Dickinson) was inserted into an antecubital vein for blood
sampling. Fasting blood tests were collected and satiety and breath H2
registered before consuming the breakfast. The standardized breakfast
(including paracetamol) was consumed at ;0800 and within 10 to 12
min. The subjects were instructed to maintain low physical activity
throughout the following 3 h of blood sampling.

Physiological variables. Finger-prick capillary blood samples were
withdrawn repeatedly for determination of blood glucose concentrations
(HemoCue B-glucose, HemoCue). Venous blood was withdrawn repeat-
edly for determination of serum insulin, FFA, IL-6, IL-8, triacylglycerol,
and paracetamol (marker of GER), and plasma adiponectin, GIP, GLP-1,
and glucagon. Breath H2 was measured as an indicator of colonic
fermentation using an EC 60 gastrolyzer (Bedfont EC60 Gastrolyzer). In
addition, pre- and postbreakfast satiety was obtained with a bipolar

rating scale, marked with 9 statements that describe the feeling of hunger
or satiation, with the statement ‘‘no speciﬁc feeling’’ in the middle of the
scale. A time schedule for determination of the physiological variables is
presented in Table 3.

Serum insulin was determined with a solid phase 2-site enzyme
immunoassay kit (insulin ELISA 10–1113–01, Mercodia), serum FFA
concentrations were measured with an enzymatic colorimetric method
(NEFA C, ACS-ACOD method, WAKO Chemicals), and serum IL-6 and
IL-8 were analyzed using enzyme immunoassay kits (TiterZyme-EIA,
Assay Designs). The procedure for the determination of serum IL-6
concentration was modiﬁed in the respect that no dilution of serum was
performed prior to the analysis. Concentrations of serum IL-6 were
measured at the standardized breakfast only following the OB bread,
HBB bread, and the WWB, respectively, and the serum IL-8 concentra-
tions were measured at breakfast following the OB bread and the WWB.
Serum triacylglycerols were analyzed with a Serum Triglyceride Deter-
mination kit (Sigma). The true triacylglycerol concentrations were
determined by subtracting circulating glycerol from total glycerol that
also include the glycerol in triacylglycerol. We measured serum paracet-
amol with an enzymatic assay kit (Paracetamol Enzyme Assay kit,
Cambridge Life Sciences). Plasma adiponectin concentrations were
measured at breakfast following the OB bread and the WWB, respec-
tively, and the concentrations were determined with a solid phase 2-site
enzyme immunoassay kit (Mercodia Adiponectin ELISA, Mercodia).
Plasma glucagon was analyzed using a glucagon RIA kit (LINCO
Research). Plasma GIP and plasma GLP-1 concentrations were deter-
mined after extraction of plasma with 70% ethanol (by volume, ﬁnal
concentration) (20). The venous blood tests were centrifuged and plasma
and serum were separated and stored in a freezer (,220°C) until
analyzed.

Calculations and statistical methods. The results are expressed as
means 6 SEM. The positive incremental area under the curve (IAUC)
was used for expressing the results of glucose, insulin, and paracetamol
responses. Total areas under the curve (AUC; basal value ¼ 0) were used
in the statistical calculations of plasma glucagon, GLP-1, GIP, and
satiety. Statistical evaluation of serum IL-6 was based on data after the
WWB, OB bread, and HBB bread and evaluations of serum IL-8 and
plasma adiponectin were based on data after the WWB and OB bread.
GraphPad Prism (version 4.03; GraphPad Software) was used for graph
plotting and calculation of areas. Signiﬁcant differences in test variables
after the different test meals were assessed with ANOVA (general linear
model) followed by Tukey’s pairwise multiple comparison method for
means,
in MINITAB Statistical Software (release 13.32; Minitab).
Differences between the products at different time points were analyzed
using a mixed model (PROC MIXED in SAS release 8.01; SAS Institute)
with repeated measures and an autoregressive covariance structure.
Spearman rank correlation was used to study relations between some of

these values we obtained the mean value of Spearman correlation
coefﬁcient. To determined the P-value, a permutation test was performed
using MATLAB with the null hypothesis that no correlations existed (the
alternative hypothesis was that the data were correlated). Pearson
correlation was used to assess relations involving serum IL-6 and plasma
adiponectin, respectively. Generally, n ¼ 15 in all calculations except
that n ¼ 14 after consumption of the HBB bread. Values of P , 0.05
were considered signiﬁcant.

Results

Blood glucose, serum insulin, and plasma glucagon
responses following the standardized breakfast. The dif-
ferent cereal evening meals did not result in signiﬁcant differ-
ences in fasting values of blood glucose, serum insulin, or plasma
glucagon by the subsequent morning. Expressed as IAUC (0–120
min), all evening meals, with the exception of WWB 1 RS and 1/
2OB bread, resulted in lower glucose response at breakfast
compared with the WWB evening meal (P , 0.05) (Fig. 1A;
Table 4). In addition, all kernel-based evening meals (whole or
cut kernels) based on 50 g available carbohydrates resulted in
lower blood glucose peak increments after the standardized
breakfast (based on peak values for each individuals) compared

similar mean glucose increments 0–60 min after the start of the
standardized breakfast (Fig. 1A). Thereafter, the glucose incre-
ment declined more rapidly following the evening meal with
CutOB bread compared with OB bread.

When expressed as IAUC (0–120 min), the insulin response
after the standardized breakfast was lower following an evening
meal with OB bread compared with an evening meal composed
of WWB (P , 0.05; Fig. 1B; Table 4).

After a slight increase in plasma glucagon concentrations in
the early postprandial phase after the standardized breakfast (up
to 15 min), the glucagon concentrations were suppressed to a
level beneath the fasting value from ;45 min and throughout
the 120-min postprandial period (Fig. 2A; Table 4). Expressing
the result as AUC (0–120 min), the plasma glucagon concentra-
tion after the standardized breakfast was lower following the
WWB evening meal compared with after the evening meals with
HBB bread, OB bread, or CutOB bread, respectively (P , 0.05).

Plasma adiponectin concentrations following the stan-
dardized breakfast. Plasma adiponectin concentrations were
measured at breakfast following the OB bread and the WWB
evening meals. The fasting concentrations of plasma adiponectin
were higher following the evening meal containing OB bread
(83.9 6 8.3 mg/L) compared with the evening meal with WWB
(77.0 6 7.3 mg/L) (P , 0.05). At 45 min after the standardized
breakfast, plasma adiponectin did not differ between WWB
(78.5 6 7.5 mg/L) and OB bread trials (82.0 6 8.6 mg/L).

Serum FFA and triacylglycerols following the standard-
ized breakfast. The fasting FFA (f-FFA) concentration was
lower in the morning after the OB bread evening meal compared
with WWB, 1/2OB bread, or HBB bread (P , 0.05) (Table 4). In
addition, the evening meal bread products composed of HAB,
CutOB, and WWB1RS resulted in lower f-FFA concentrations
compared with the WWB evening meal (P , 0.01). In contrast,
at breakfast, the serum triacylglycerols did not differ depending
on the test meal consumed the previous evening.

Plasma GLP-1 and GIP concentrations following the
standardized breakfast. The fasting plasma GLP-1 (Fig. 2B)
and GIP concentrations (Fig. 2C) did not differ signiﬁcantly after
the different evening meals. The total GLP-1 AUC (0–120 min)
after the standardized breakfast was higher following the OB
bread evening meal (3513 6 333 pmolmin/L) in comparison
with after the WWB evening meal (2843 6 265 pmolmin/L)
(P , 0.05).

Expressed as 0–120 min AUC, the plasma GIP response did
not differ after the standardized breakfast depending on test
evening meals. However, the differences in plasma GIP concen-
trations after the breakfast tended to increase toward the late
postprandial phase. Consequently, the plasma GIP AUC 60–120
min after the breakfast was higher following the evening meal
with HBB bread (2610 6 340 pmolmin/L) compared with after
the evening meal with WWB (2030 6 225 pmolmin/L) (P ,
0.01).

Serum IL-6 and IL-8 concentrations following the stan-
dardized breakfast. Serum IL-6 concentrations were analyzed
post breakfast following the evening meals with WWB, OB
bread, and HBB bread. Expressing the results as mean values (0–
180 min), the plasma IL-6 concentration after the standardized
breakfast was lower following the OB bread evening meal (13.6 6
1.0 ng/L) compared with following the WWB evening meal
(16.3 6 1.0 ng/L; P , 0.01). There were no differences in plasma

following the standardized breakfast

Breath H2 excretion following the standardized breakfast.
Expressed in terms of breath H2 excretion (mean 0–180 min), the
HBB bread evening meal induced higher colonic activity at
breakfast the following morning compared with all the other
evening meals (P , 0.01) except the HAB bread (Fig. 3A). The
HAB bread evening meals resulted in higher colonic activity at
breakfast compared with the WWB and the 1/2OB bread evening
test meals (P , 0.05). In addition, the colonic fermentation was
higher in the late postprandial phase post the breakfast (at 180
min) after the OB bread evening meal (23.3 6 4.5 ppm) com-
pared with the WWB evening meal (6.6 6 2.0 ppm) (P , 0.05).

GER and satiety score following the standardized break-
fast. As judged from the serum paracetamol IAUC (0–90 min),
the GER after the standardized breakfast was lower following
the evening meal with HBB bread (IAUC 2.23 6 0.3 mmolmin/L)
compared with following evening meals with WWB (IAUC
3.43 6 0.4 mmolmin/L), WWB1RS (IAUC 3.42 6 0.3
mmolmin/L), and 1/2OB bread (IAUC 3.34 6 0.2 mmolmin/L)
(P , 0.05) (Fig. 3B). After the evening meal with WWB, the
serum paracetamol concentration after the standardized break-
fast reached a peak value at 60 min, whereas the rest of the even-
ing test meals resulted in a continuous increase of this marker
throughout the test period (0–90 min).

The evening meal with HBB bread resulted in a higher satiety
score (IAUC 0–180 min) after the standardized breakfast
compared with after all the other evening meals (P , 0.05; Fig.
3C).

Relations between test variables. The glucose response after
the standardized breakfast (IAUC 0–120 min) was inversely
related to colonic fermentation, as determined by breath H2
excretion (0–180 min) (r ¼ 20.25; P , 0.05). Furthermore, the
postprandial glucose response (IAUC 0–120 min) after the stan-
dardized breakfast was positively correlated to the f-FFA (r ¼
0.37; P , 0.001). The serum insulin response (IAUC 0–120 min)
correlated to f-FFA in a similar manner (r ¼ 0.23; P , 0.05). In
addition, serum IL-6 concentrations (mean 0–180 min) were posi-
tively correlated with the f-FFA concentration (r ¼ 0.32; P , 0.05).
The blood glucose response (IAUC 0–120 min) after the
standardized breakfast was inversely related to plasma GLP-1

(AUC 0–120 min) (r ¼ 20.26; P , 0.05) and glucagon (AUC

The mean concentration (0–45 min) of adiponectin was

Discussion

An evening meal of barley kernel bread (OB bread) signiﬁcantly
improved glucose tolerance at a following standardized break-
fast in healthy subjects. Consequently, the IAUC 0–120 at
breakfast was reduced by 28% after the OB bread evening meal
compared with the corresponding area following ingestion of a
WWB evening meal. Cutting the barley kernels 1–2 times did not
deteriorate the ‘‘overnight’’ beneﬁts to glucose tolerance. Also,
the evening meal bread made from white wheat ﬂour enriched
with both barley DF and RS in amounts corresponding to that in
the OB bread lowered the blood glucose IAUC (0–120 min) at
breakfast compared with the WWB evening meal by ;26%.
This is an important ﬁnding when aiming at exploiting the
beneﬁts of cereal products in new and palatable low-GI foods
with optimal beneﬁts to blood glucose regulation. In previous
studies, no signiﬁcant effects on overnight glucose tolerance
were observed when adding DF (with no added RS) from wheat,
barley, or oats to a high- or low-GI evening meal in quantities
similar to that in barley kernels (13,21).

Predicted from the rate of in vitro hydrolysis of starch (WWB
as a reference), all test products based on whole or cut cereal
kernels had low GIs (#55). In contrast, the WWB1DF1RS had
a predicted GI of 85. The results from this study therefore
indicate that low-GI features per se do not seem to be necessary
for overnight beneﬁts to glucose tolerance. The HAB bread
evening meal displayed a more pronounced capacity to lower the
breakfast glucose response (IAUC 0–120 min) compared with
WWB (236%; P ¼ 0.001) than did the evening meal with OB
bread (228%; P , 0.05). This indicates that the elevated level of
indigestible carbohydrates, and particularly RS, in the HAB

bread meal (22.0 g vs. 9.5 g in the OB bread meal) resulted in
additional beneﬁts with respect to overnight glucose tolerance.
The serving of HBB bread was in addition to its elevated
content of b-glucans also rich in RS and insoluble DF. Due to the
low concentration of available starch in this bread, the size of the
HBB serving (equivalent to 50 g available starch) became large
(388 g). One of the subjects failed to eat this meal and another 3
ﬁnished only ;75% of the serving. The HBB bread evening meal
resulted in a low and prolonged net increment in blood glucose

concentration after the standardized breakfast. The appearance
of the 0–120-min blood glucose curve at breakfast after the HBB
evening meal bread is probably related to a decreased GER at the
time of the breakfast (measured as appearance of paracetamol in
serum after the breakfast). The fact that a signiﬁcant negative
correlation was observed between the GER and subjective rating
of satiety after the standardized breakfast suggests that the

higher satiety obtained after the HBB evening meal was the
result of a lower GER. Such a relation between increased satiety
and lowered GER is in concordance with observations by
Verdich et al. (22).

A limitation of the conclusions from this study could be that the
subjects consumed the test meals in their home and, except from a
form to be answered by the subjects, it was not possible to fully
control adherence to the written instructions. For example, not
following the instructions regarding the time point for intake of the
evening test meals or fasting prior to ingestion of the standardized
breakfast may have inﬂuenced the results. Another study limita-
tion regarding relations between GI and overnight effects could be
that the GI of the test products were not determined but were
predicted in vitro. However, for cereal products, the predicted and
measured GI have been shown to correlate well (18). Moreover,
the range of predicted GI are coherent with previously published
data for similar products (23).

In this study, the blood glucose response to the standardized
breakfast (IAUC 0–120 min) was positively correlated to the f-FFA
concentrations. Such a relation has also been observed in previous
studies examining the effects of various test breakfasts at a stan-
dardized lunch (24) or from an evening test meal to a standardized
breakfast (13,25), respectively. The concentration of circulating
FFA is known to affect insulin sensitivity in a dose-dependent
manner also within a modest range (440–695 mmol/L, healthy lean
subjects) (26) and we strongly suggest that suppression of FFA
concentration is a main cause for the overnight beneﬁts seen on
glucose tolerance at the breakfast meal in this study.

The reason for the overnight decreased serum FFA with some
cereal-based evening meals is not clear, but several factors may be
involved. First, a prolonged fed state after low-GI foods related
to their improved capacity to reduce the rate of digestion and
absorption, thereby maintaining FFA suppressed for a longer time
period, has previously been suggested as a mechanism for the
improved glucose tolerance from breakfast to a standardized lunch
(24). However, in this study, the period between the meals was
10.5 h, which probably is too long for a substantial suppression of
FFA concentrations due to a reduced fasting state. Second, it is
possible that the higher concentration of fasting plasma adipo-
nectin, as seen in the morning after the OB bread evening meal,
might have affected the FFA concentrations. Thus, it has been
shown that adiponectin promote an increased rate in clearance of
FFA from the blood, hence improving insulin sensitivity (27,28).
Third, it has been shown that IL-6 stimulates an increase in FFA
concentration that may persist for several hours after an acute
increase in IL-6 (29). The positive correlation between serum IL-6
and FFA in this study further supports such a relation. Finally,
metabolites produced during colonic fermentation of indigestible
carbohydrates may enter the systemic circulation and it has been
suggested that SCFA, particularly propionate, may exert systemic
effects, including beneﬁts to glucose metabolism (13,25,30,31)
and lowered plasma FFA concentrations in humans (32,33). In this
study, a negative correlation existed between breath H2 excretion
and glucose response (IAUC 0–120 min) at breakfast, consistent
with the notion that colonic fermentation may be involved in the
modulation of overnight glucose tolerance.

Colonic fermentation of indigestible carbohydrates may have
implications on glucose tolerance through several mechanisms. In
this study, GLP-1 and glucose response at the standardized
breakfast (IAUC 0–120 min) were inversely related. According
to previous studies in animals, certain DF promotes secretion of
GLP-1, an effect suggested to be mediated by bacterial colonic
fermentation and formation of SCFA (34,35). In addition, our
results indicate that colonic fermentation (measured by breath H2)

was involved in modulating satiety, possibly through a reduced
GER. A meta-analysis in obese and lean subjects of the effect of
GLP-1 on ad libitum energy intake in humans showed increased
satiety concomitant with reduced GER, which was suggested to be
a contributing factor (22). Furthermore, GLP-1 infusions in that
study reduced the energy intake dose dependently in both lean and
overweight subjects.

In this study, the evening meal consisting of kernel-based
barley bread (OB bread) resulted in lower concentrations of IL-6
and higher concentrations of adiponectin the following morning
compared with a WWB evening meal, indicating antiinﬂamma-
tory properties of the OB bread product.

In conclusion, a cereal-based evening meal with adequate
amounts of speciﬁc indigestible carbohydrates (barley DF and RS)
was capable of improving glucose excursion and increased the
satiety after a sequent standardized high-GI breakfast. Of partic-
ular interest is the ﬁnding that a mixture of DF and RS added to
WWB, simulating the content of these components in the OB
bread evening meal, induced similar beneﬁts to overnight glucose
tolerance as did the OB bread. These results suggest that it may be
possible to tailor novel low-GI whole-grain foods capable of
facilitating glycemic regulation not only at the acute meal but also
at a meal ingested 10 h thereafter. The overnight beneﬁts to glucose
tolerance and satiety are probably mediated by mechanisms
emanating from colonic fermentation and suggest that speciﬁc
combinations of indigestible carbohydrates may have prebiotic
effects. The beneﬁts were associated with decreased concentra-
tions of FFA and IL-6 and increased GLP-1 and adiponectin at the
time of the breakfast, thus providing evidence for a link between
the gut microbial metabolism and key factors associated with
insulin resistance.

Abstract
Background:  Soluble  fibers  lower  serum  lipids,  but  are  difficult  to  incorporate  into  products
acceptable to consumers. We investigated the physiological effects of a concentrated oat β-glucan
on  cardiovascular  disease  (CVD)  endpoints  in  human  subjects.  We  also  compared  the
fermentability  of  concentrated  oat  β-glucan  with  inulin  and  guar  gum  in  a  model  intestinal
fermentation system.
Methods: Seventy-five hypercholesterolemic men and women were randomly assigned to one of
two treatments: 6 grams/day concentrated oat β-glucan or 6 grams/day dextrose (control). Fasting
blood samples were collected at baseline, week 3, and week 6 and analyzed for total cholesterol,
HDL  cholesterol,  LDL  cholesterol,  triglycerides,  glucose,  insulin,  homocysteine  and  C-reactive
protein (CRP). To estimate colonic fermentability, 0.5 g concentrated oat β-glucan was incubated
in  a  batch  model  intestinal  fermentation  system,  using  human  fecal  inoculum  to  provide
representative microflora. Fecal donors were not involved with the β-glucan feeding trial. Inulin and
guar gum were also incubated in separate serum bottles for comparison.
Results: Oat β-glucan produced significant reduction from baseline in total cholesterol (-0.3 ± 0.1
mmol/L) and LDL cholesterol (-0.3 ± 0.1 mmol/L), and the reduction in LDL cholesterol were
significantly  greater  than  in  the  control  group  (p  =  0.03).  Concentrated  oat  β-glucan  was  a
fermentable fiber and produced total SCFA and acetate concentrations similar to inulin and guar
gum. Concentrated oat β-glucan produced the highest concentrations of butyrate at 4, 8, and 12
hours.
Conclusion: Six grams concentrated oat β-glucan per day for six weeks significantly reduced total
and LDL cholesterol in subjects with elevated cholesterol, and the LDL cholesterol reduction was
greater than the change in the control group. Based on a model intestinal fermentation, this oat β-
glucan was fermentable, producing higher amounts of butyrate than other fibers. Thus, a practical
dose of β-glucan can significantly lower serum lipids in a high-risk population and may improve
colon health.

Background
Cardiovascular  disease  (CVD)  remains  the  top  cause  of
death in the United States, with saturated fat and trans fat
intake, serum cholesterol, and obesity as major risk fac-
tors. Diets recommended for improvement of cardiovas-
cular risk factors include a diet high in dietary fiber. Cereal
fibers that are high in water-soluble fiber, such as β-glu-
can,  may  improve  cardiovascular  disease  risk  through
improvements in serum cholesterol and other intermedi-
ary risk factors. Oats are high in soluble fiber and appear
to reduce CVD risk when consumed as part of a moderate
fat, balanced diet. Soluble fiber β-glucan is thought to be
the active component for the cholesterol lowering effect of
oats.  Few  studies  have  been  conducted  on  the  effective-
ness of concentrated β-glucan from oats and changes in
physiological endpoints.

Concentrated  β-glucan  from  oat  is  now  commercially
available as a dietary supplement. Oat β-glucan is a natu-
ral  polymer  comprised  of  individual  glucose  molecules
that are linked together by a series of β-(1–3) and β-(1–4)
linkages.  Beta-glucan  was  identified  as  the  major  fer-
mentable  component  in  both  cooked  and  uncooked
rolled oats; the beta-glucan was not affected by cooking
[1]. Rolled oats and isolated beta-glucan (termed oat gum
in  the  report)  contributed  to  increased  gut  viscosity  in
male Wistar rats [2].

The  hypothesis  that  soluble  dietary  fiber  lowers  blood
cholesterol  levels  by  interfering  with  the  absorption  of
dietary  cholesterol  is  appealing.  Increased  gut  viscosity
may prevent dietary cholesterol from reaching the intesti-
nal epithelium. However, it is unlikely that fiber-induced
hypocholesterolemia is solely a result of this mechanism
[3].  Exogenenous  cholesterol  represents  only  about  one
quarter of the body's cholesterol, and a significant change
in  absorption  would  lead  to  even  smaller  changes  in
blood  cholesterol  levels.  Some  fibers  may  decrease
absorption of dietary cholesterol by altering the composi-
tion of the bile acid pool. Pectin and oat bran increased
the portion of the total bile acid pool that was deoxycholic
acid  (DCA)  [4].  DCA  has  been  noted  to  decrease  the
absorption of exogenous cholesterol in humans [5]. Fer-
mentation  products  may  also  alter  cholesterol  metabo-
lism.  Propionate  is  thought  to  suppress  cholesterol
synthesis, but some results have been inconclusive [6-10].
Acetate  produced  by  the  fermentation  of  oat  bran  may
also contribute to cholesterol lowering [11].

Studying gut effects of fiber in humans is difficult due to
the invasive and expensive nature of colonic observation
as well as the dynamic nature of the colon. Excreted colon
contents will not necessary represent colon contents in the
proximal or even distal colon, due to continual fermenta-
tion  of  fiber  and  continual  absorption  of  minerals  and

SCFA  across  the  epithelium.  In  vitro  fermentation  is  a
noninvasive,  time-efficient  means  to  estimate  fiber  fer-
mentability.

The  cholesterol  lowering  effect  of  whole  oats  has  been
well  documented  and  the  United  States  FDA  issued  a
health claim on oats for the prevention of cardiovascular
disease in 1996 [12]. However, limited research has been
conducted with oat β-glucan separated from the oat grain.
This  current  paper  aims  to  determine  if  the  beneficial
physiological effects of oats can be seen with concentrated
oat β-glucan.

A barrier to use of soluble fiber in the past has been the
poor  acceptability  of  foods  high  in  soluble  fiber  for  an
extended  period.  We  measured  the  effect  of  6  g/day  of
concentrated β-glucan from oat on biomarkers of interest
in CHD and CVD. The human feeding trial was designed
to  identify  if  the  physiological  effects  of  concentrated  β
glucan from oat will improve serum biomarkers of cardi-
ovascular risk in subjects at high risk of cardiovascular dis-
ease  by  measuring  changes  in  total  cholesterol,  LDL-
cholesterol,  HDL-cholesterol,  triglycerides,  apolipopro-
tein A-1, apolipoprotein B and other blood metabolites.
Model  intestinal  fermentation  was  used  to  estimate  in
vivo short-chain fatty acid production.

Methods
Ninety  hypercholesterolemic  subjects  were  recruited  for
the study via flyers posted on the University of Minnesota
campus and newspaper advertisements in the University
of  Minnesota  Daily  newspaper.  To  be  included  in  the
study, subjects needed to be healthy, non-smoking men
and women between the ages of 22 and 65 years at risk for
CVD (as defined by a total cholesterol greater than 200
mg/dl), with spoken and written English literacy. Subjects
exclusion criteria included BMI > 30 upon admission to
study; CVD, Diabetes Mellitus (fasting blood sugar > 126
mg/dl),  chronic  inflammatory  diseases  (e.g.  Crohn's,
rheumatoid  arthritis),  cancer  in  prior  5  years,  renal  or
hepatic  disease,  recent  bacterial  infection  (<  2  weeks),
acute febrile illness in prior 2 months, history of drug or
alcohol  abuse  in  prior  6  months,  lipid-lowering,  anti-
hypertensive  or  anti-inflammatory  steroid  medication
use, active weight loss > 5 kg in prior 3 months (intended
or  unintended),  concurrent  or  recent  (within  30  days)
intervention study participation. The inclusion and exclu-
sion  criteria  were  assessed  via  telephone  screening,  a
health history questionnaire, and the initial total choles-
terol  screening  visit.  Subjects  received  oral  and  written
information about the study, including a comprehensive
study  newsletter  and  individual  written  consent  was
obtained from each subject.

Subjects were asked to consume their usual diet with the
addition of either a placebo supplement or dietary fiber
from oat. The risks in the study were minimal. Subjects
maintained  their  usual  activities  during  the  study  with
periodic  visits  for  information  sessions,  sample  collec-
tions, and supplement pickup.

Study design
The  University  of  Minnesota  Institutional  Review  Board
Human Subjects Committee approved all aspects of this
research. The study was a randomized, double-blind par-
allel  group  design.  A  total  of  90  patients  were  enrolled
with  45  patients  per  treatment  arm.  Subjects  were  ran-
domly assigned to either placebo or treatment, stratified
by age and sex. Fifteen subjects (n = 10 treatment, n = 5
placebo) were excluded from final analysis because their
baseline cholesterol value was below 200 mg/dl despite a
screening value above 200 mg/dl. Treatment was 6 grams
of concentrated β-glucan from oat per day (from 12 g oat
bran concentrate containing 54% oat β glucan). Placebo
was 6 grams of dextrose monohydrate per day. Both were
delivered as dietary supplements in the form of a powder.
Subjects mixed their supplement with a beverage using a
study-provided  electric  hand  blender  (Braun).  Subjects
were instructed to take the supplement via oral adminis-
tration  with  their  morning  and  evening  meal  for  six
weeks.

Study visits
Subjects attended an initial pre-screening visit to verify eli-
gibility for the study (visit 1). Subjects who met study cri-
teria were scheduled for a baseline visit, one day before
the intervention began (visit 2). Visits 3 and 4 were sched-
uled for day 21 (midpoint) and day 42 (final) of the inter-
vention.

Diet records
Three-day diet records were obtained from each subject at
the midpoint and final visits. Subjects recorded two week-
days and one weekend day of their total food intake. All
records  were  analyzed  for  total  nutrient  composition  of
each  day's  intake  using  the  First  DataBank  Nutritionist
Five  software.  Total  calories,  carbohydrate,  fat,  protein,
cholesterol,  saturated  fat,  monounsaturated  fat,  polyun-
saturated fat, total fiber, soluble fiber, insoluble fiber and
crude  fiber  were  analyzed  for  each  subject  for  average
intake. Analysis of fiber did not include the addition of
oat β-glucan to the diet.

Blood samples
At  each  visit  subjects  were  asked  to  fast  overnight  for  a
minimum  of  10  hours  and  then  have  blood  samples
drawn at the General Clinical Research Center, University
of Minnesota, Twin Cities. Blood was drawn for the fol-
lowing measurements: plasma total cholesterol, triglycer-

ides, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, apolipoprotein A-
I, apolipoprotein B, complete blood count and differen-
tial, homocysteine, c-reactive protein and comprehensive
metabolic  panel.  Plasma  LDL  cholesterol  concentration
was calculated using the Friedewald equation. All speci-
mens  collected  were  transported  via  courier  to  Quest
Diagnostics (Wood Dale, IL) for analysis.

Anthropometric measurements
Blood pressure was measured at each visit for each subject
using a standardized sphygmomanometer (Tycos). Three
measurements  were  taken,  one  minute  apart,  with  the
subject 
the
approved  National  Institutes  of  Health  method  [13].
These three values were averaged individually for diastolic
and systolic pressures. Standing weight was recorded every
visit to the nearest 1/4 lb with light clothing and no shoes
on a calibrated balance beam scale.

in  a  semi-reclined  position 

following 

Symptom survey
Each visit participants completed a short survey rating gas-
trointestinal  effects  on  a  scale  related  to  normal.  Symp-
toms recorded include: frequency of stools, consistency of
stools,  degree  of  intestinal bloating  and  degree of  flatu-
lence.

Model intestinal fermentation
Concentrated  oat  β-glucan  (54%  β-glucan),  partially
hydrolyzed guar gum (MW 400 kDa), and inulin (90% dp
= 10, 10% dp = 1–2) were subjected to model intestinal
fermentation  [14].  Glucose  served  as  a  positive  control
because  it  is  fully  fermentable  by  colonic  bacteria.  No
fiber was the negative control to assess the concentrations
of  SCFA  produced  from  substrates  residing  in  the  fecal
inoculum. Chemical reagents were obtained from Fisher
Scientific (New Hampton, NH, USA), Sigma Aldrich (St.
Louis, MO, USA), and VWR Scientific (West Chester, PA,
USA).

Briefly, the fibers were hydrated for 12 hours in 40 ml ster-
ile trypticase peptone media fortified with minerals, phos-
phate  buffer,  and  a  reducing  solution  (950  ml  distilled
water,  6.25  g  cysteine  hydrochloride,  40  ml  1N  NaOH,
6.25 g sodium sulfide monohydrate) at 4°C. Five-100 mL
serum bottles were prepared for each fiber sample (0.5 g),
one for each of the five time points: 0, 4, 8, 12, and 24
hours. Control bottles containing either 0.5 g glucose or
no added carbohydrate were prepared in the same man-
ner. Two hours prior to inoculation with fecal solution,
sample bottles were warmed to 37°C. Fecal inoculum was
prepared as described by McBurney and Thompson [14].
Fecal  samples  from  three  human  subjects  consuming  a
nonspecified Western diet were pooled (125 g total) and
diluted  with  400  ml  distilled  water.  The  solution  was

homogenized in a blender. Reducing solution was added
to the fecal ino 2 parts reducing solution [15].

Ten  milliliters  of  fecal  inoculum  was  added  into  each
serum bottle along with 0.8 mL Oxyrase® oxygen reducing
enzyme (Oxyrase Inc., Mansfield, OH). The bottles were
immediately flushed with carbon dioxide gas to eliminate
oxygen  and  generate  anaerobic  conditions.  The  bottles
were gently shaken in a 37°C water bath. One sample bot-
tle for each fiber was removed at 0, 4, 8, 12, and 24 hours.
Immediately upon removal, 1 mL of copper sulfate (200
g/L) was added to each bottle to kill the bacteria and cease
fermentation. Two-2 ml aliquots were removed. Samples
were prepared for gas chromatography as described previ-
ously [16,17].

Lactate, acetate, propionate, butyrate isobutyrate, 2-meth-
ylbutyrate,  isovalerate,  and  valerate  were  determined  by
gas  chromatography  using  a  Hewlett  Packard  6890  gas
chromatograph (Hewlett Packard, Palo Alto, CA) with a
4%  carbowax  20  M/80/120  carbopack  B-DA  column
(Supleco, Bellefonte, PA) a temperature of 175 degrees C.
Flow  rates  for  nitrogen,  hydrogen,  and  air  were  24,  40,
and  450  mL/min,  respectively.  All  SCFA  concentrations
were  corrected  for  the  control  concentration  of  SCFA  at
each time point. Molar ratios of SCFA were determined by
dividing the number of moles of each SCFA (acetate, pro-
pionate, and butyrate) by the total moles of acetate, pro-
pionate, and butyrate.

Statistical analysis
Data was reported as means ± SEM. Changes were calcu-
lated  by  subtracting  baseline  from  the  6-week  value,  so
that positive changes indicate an increase. Baseline values
and  changes  were  compared  between  oat  β-glucan  and
control  by  two-sample  t-tests,  while  paired  t-tests  were
used  for  within-group  changes  from  baseline.  In  the
model  intestinal  fermentation,  all  SCFA  concentrations
were corrected for the negative control concentration of
SCFA at each time point. SCFA concentrations were com-
pared between fibers at each time point separately, using
Tukey pairwise procedure for multiple comparisons. Sta-
tistical analyses were performed with SAS statistical soft-
ware  package,  versions  8.0  and  9.1  (SAS  Institute  Inc,
Cary, NC, USA).

Results
Human trial
Demographic and clinical characteristics of the oat β-glu-
can and control groups did not differ at baseline (Table 1).
There  were  no  changes  from  baseline  in  dietary  intake,
weight, or blood pressure in either group (Table 2). Total
cholesterol  significantly  decreased  within  the  treatment
group (p < 0.025). Total cholesterol decreased 0.3 ± 0.1
mmol/L (mean ± SEM) in subjects consuming oat β-glu-

can. Total cholesterol did not significantly change within
the placebo group. Total cholesterol decreased 0.1 ± 0.08
mmol/L (mean ± SEM) within the placebo group, but this
change was not significant. Total cholesterol did not sig-
nificantly change between groups.

LDL  cholesterol  significantly  decreased  within  the  treat-
ment group (p < 0.025). LDL cholesterol dropped 0.3 ±
0.1 mmol/L (mean ± SEM) in subjects consuming oat β-
glucan.  LDL  cholesterol  did  not  change  significantly
within  the  placebo  group;  the  mean  decrease  was  0.04
mmol/L. Treatment of oat β-glucan significantly lowered
LDL  cholesterol  compared  to  control  (p  <  0.026).  HDL
cholesterol did not change significantly in either the treat-
ment or placebo group.

Triglycerides increased 0.09 ± 0.1 mmol/L (mean ± SEM)
in the treatment group, but this change was not signifi-
cantly different than 0. Triglycerides fell 0.2 ± 0.1 mmol/
L  (mean  ±  SEM)  in  the  placebo  group.  The  triglyceride
change between the treatment and control group was sig-
nificantly different (p = 0.030).

The oat β-glucan group experienced significant reduction
from  baseline  in  total  cholesterol  and  LDL  cholesterol,
and the reduction in LDL cholesterol was greater than in
the control group. Triglycerides were reduced in the con-
trol group but not the oat β-glucan group. Neither group
showed  changes  in  HDL  cholesterol,  C-reactive  protein,
homocysteine, insulin, or glucose.

Both  groups  reported  no  change  in  stool  consistency,
stool frequency, and bloating during the study, although
the  oat  β-glucan  group  reported  increased  flatulence.
Three-day  food  records  completed  on  days  1–3,  22–24,
and 39–41 were analyzed to verify dietary intake did not
significantly change during the study. Changes in energy
intake and diet composition are shown in Table 2.

Model intestinal fermentation
Concentrations  of  total  short-chain  fatty  acids  (TSCFA),
acetate,  propionate,  and  butyrate  produced  during  the
model intestinal fermentation are shown in Table 3. Con-
centrated oat β-glucan and inulin produced similar con-
centrations of TSCFA and were both significantly greater
than guar gum at 4 hours. Oat β-glucan TSCFA production
increased from 0 to 8 hours, and remained constant from
8 to 24 hours. Total short-chain fatty acid production by
inulin  peaked  at  8  hours  and  decreased  until  24  hours.
Guar gum produced increasing concentrations of TSCFA
at  all  time  points.  At  24  hours,  guar  gum  produced  the
greatest concentrations of TSCFA while oat-β glucan and
inulin produced significantly few TSCFA.

Acetate  was  the  major  contributor  to  TSCFA  concentra-
tions at all time points by all fibers. Acetate production
mimicked the TSCFA production patterns with oat β-glu-
can  and  inulin  being  the  fermented  more  rapidly  than
guar gum between 0 and 4 hours. At 8 hours, inulin pro-
duced  significantly  more  acetate  than  oat  β-glucan  and
guar gum. Acetate production at 12 hours was not differ-
ent  between  the  three  fibers.  At  24  hours,  oat  β-glucan
produced the lowest concentrations of acetate, although
this difference was only significant between guar gum and
oat-β glucan.

Propionate was the SCFA produced in the second greatest
concentration by oat β-glucan and guar gum. Oat β-glu-
can  produced  little  propionate  between  0  and  8  hours.
From 8 to 24 hours, oat β-glucan produced propionate at
a  constant  rate.  Concentrations  of  propionate  produced
by oat β-glucan were less than guar gum but greater than
inulin from 8 to 24 hours.

Oat-β  glucan  produced  the  greatest  butyrate  concentra-
tions  from  4  to  12  hours.  Between  12  and  24  hours,
butyrate  production  by  inulin  increased  dramatically,
resulting in the greatest butyrate production at 24 hours.
Oat β-glucan produced the second greatest concentration

Discussion
Large, prospective, epidemiologic studies find a protective
effect of dietary fiber against coronary heart disease and
form  the  basis  for  recommendations  from  the  National
Academy of Science for fiber intake (38 and 25 grams per
day  for  young  men  and  women)[18].  It  has  been  pro-
posed  that  a  protective  effect  of  soluble  dietary  fiber
against CVD is mediated through direct or indirect effects
on serum lipids. This study supports that oat β-glucan's
role in CVD protection is through its effects on serum lip-
ids. Virtually  all  other  markers  tested,  other than  serum
lipids and apo B, did not significantly change as a result of
6 grams concentrated β-glucan.

Dietary fiber, as defined by the Institute of Medicine, con-
sists  of  nondigestible  carbohydrates  and  lignin  that  are
intrinsic and intact in plants [19]. Functional fiber consists
of  concentrated,  nondigestible  carbohydrates  that  have
beneficial physiological effects in humans [19]. The IOM
recommended  the  elimination  of  the  terms  soluble  and
insoluble. New terms, viscous and fermentable, were recom-

mended to describe the physicochemical properties of fib-
ers.  Viscous  fibers  such  as  β-glucan  and  guar  gum  have
been shown to decrease blood LDL-cholesterol concentra-
tions  in  animal  models  [20]  and  clinical  intervention
studies [21]. We have shown that consumption of oat β-
glucan  as  a  functional  fiber  has  similar  physiological
effects as oat β-glucan intact in oats.

The reduction of cholesterol is possibly a sum of several
effects. It is commonly accepted however that the majority
of effect is due to decreased absorption of bile acids. This
causes a removal of steroids from the body by fecal excre-
tion  resulting in increased catabolism of  cholesterol, an
increase in the secretion of bile acids, a decrease in lipo-
protein cholesterol secretion, and a reduction in the total
body pool of cholesterol [22]. Viscous fibers such as oat β-
glucan can interfere with the absorption of dietary fat and
cholesterol as well as enterohepatic recirculation of cho-
lesterol and bile acids.

Viscous  fibers  may  also  delay  the  gastric  emptying  of
ingested foods into the small intestine, resulting in a sen-
sation  of  fullness,  which  may  help  weight  control.
Delayed  gastric  emptying  may  also  reduce  postprandial

blood  glucose  concentrations  leading  to  greater  insulin
sensitivity. In this study however, subjects consuming oat
β-glucan or placebo had no change in weight. Perhaps a
six week study is too short to impact subjects' weight. In
addition, the oat β-glucan had no effect on fasting glucose
or insulin concentrations.

Dietary fiber intake may also displace saturated fat intake
and  thus  reduce  CVD  events  [23].  However,  three-day
food records show no significant difference in saturated
fat between treatment and placebo groups – supporting
the  idea  that  dietary  fiber  has  beneficial  cardiovascular
effects independent of saturated fat.

The decrease in LDL cholesterol (0.3 mmol/L) as a result
of oat β-glucan administration was a modest decrease. Sta-
tin treatment has been shown to decrease LDL cholesterol
by 1.3 mmol/L over the course of a six week intervention
[24]. However, the decrease in LDL cholesterol as a result
of  concentrated  oat  β-glucan  administration  is  large
enough to be clinically relevant. A 0.26 mmol/L increase
in LDL cholesterol results in a 12% increase in risk of CVD
[25].

Dietary interventions, such as The Portfolio diet which is
high in plant sterols, soy protein, almonds, and viscous
fiber, have been documented to reduce cholesterol levels
as effectively as statin therapy [26]. The 12 gram dose of
oat β-glucan used in this study was an acceptable dose to
the subjects and provided clinically significant changes in
cholesterol levels. The effectiveness of concentrated oat β-
glucan as an add-on to statin therapy is beyond the scope
of this study, but should be considered for future research.
Concentrated oat β-glucan would be suitable as a stand-
alone  supplement  to  lower  cholesterol.  This  product
could also be used as a food ingredient to increase fiber
content of food. When incorporated into minimally proc-
essed, low-fat food, concentrated oat β-glucan is hypothe-
sized to retain is hypocholesterolemic effects.

This  study  also  estimated  the  fermentability  of  concen-
trated oat β-glucan in a model intestinal fermentation sys-
tem. Studying colonic fermentation in healthy humans is
very difficult. The colonic epithelium is a dynamic system
which  is  continually  absorbing  SCFAs  as  they  are  being
produced by colonic bacteria. Currently, no method exists
to  measure  SCFA  absorption  across  the  epithelium  in
humans. Short-chain fatty acid concentration in feces is a
reasonable measurement of colonic fermentability. How-
ever, model intestinal fermentation is a more rapid, non-
invasive,  method  of  assessing  fermentability  and  results
from this method correspond with fermentability in vivo
[27,28].

Colonic  fermentation  varies  between  individuals  as  a
result of species of gut bacteria and intestinal transit time.
Absorption  varies  between  individuals  due  to  colonic
retention time and other metabolites present in the feces,
such  as  bicarbonate  or  sodium.  The  batch  fermentation
system eliminates differences in SCFA production due to
the aforementioned variables and allows several fibers to
be compared subjectively. Short-chain fatty acid produc-
tion may play a role in decreasing cholesterol, but acetate
and propionate concentrations were not remarkably dif-
ferent  than  concentrations  produced  by  inulin  or  guar
gum. Other mechanisms discussed above likely contrib-
ute to the cholesterol lowering feature of oat β-glucan.

The  data  from  this  study  supports  numerous  studies
showing increased intakes of viscous fiber decrease blood
LDL-cholesterol  concentrations  [21].  Insulin  concentra-
tions, glucose concentrations, weight, homocysteine and
CRP however did not significantly change in response to
oat β-glucan and lead us to the question "Is this functional
fiber  different  than  dietary  fiber?"  It  is  likely  that  some
food constituents, such as vitamins, trace elements, phe-
nolic compounds, and phytoestrogens, found in fiber-rich
foods also affect CVD risk and operate via pathways other
than  the  lipid-regulating  pathway  [29].  The  functional
fiber, oat β-glucan, may be beneficial to subjects with high
CVD risk because of its ability to significantly lower LDL
cholesterol concentrations. However, several other mech-
anisms may underlie the cardiovascular benefits of dietary
fiber. These include improvement in postprandial glucose
and insulin responses and lowering of blood pressure and
body weight [30]. Thus, the present study suggests that oat
β-glucan  significantly  lowers  LDL-cholesterol  concentra-
tions in subjects with high CVD risk.

Conclusion
A dosage of 6 grams concentrated β-glucan per day for six
weeks  produced  significant  reduction  from  baseline  in
total and LDL cholesterol. The reduction in LDL choles-
terol was significantly greater than in the control group.
These results indicate that concentrated β-glucan may be
beneficial to high cardiovascular disease risk populations.
Concentrated  oat  β-glucan  is  a  fermentable  fiber,  with
SCFA  production  similar  to  inulin  and  guar  gum,  as
shown  in  model  intestinal  fermentation.  This  source  of
fiber  will  likely  increase  SCFA  concentrations  in  the
human colon, in addition to lowering LDL cholesterol.

Coffee, Decaffeinated Coffee, and Tea Consumption
in Relation to Incident Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus

A Systematic Review With Meta-analysis

Background: Coffee consumption has been reported to
be inversely associated with risk of type 2 diabetes melli-
tus. Similar associations have also been reported for de-
caffeinated coffee and tea. We report herein the findings
of meta-analyses for the association between coffee, de-
caffeinated coffee, and tea consumption with risk of dia-
betes.

Methods: Relevant studies were identified through search
engines using a combined text word and MeSH (Medi-
cal Subject Headings) search strategy. Prospective stud-
ies that reported an estimate of the association between
coffee, decaffeinated coffee, or tea with incident diabe-
tes between 1966 and July 2009.

Results: Data from 18 studies with information on
457 922 participants reported on the association be-
tween coffee consumption and diabetes. Six (N=225 516)
and 7 studies (N=286 701) also reported estimates of the
association between decaffeinated coffee and tea with dia-

betes, respectively. We found an inverse log-linear rela-
tionship between coffee consumption and subsequent risk
of diabetes such that every additional cup of coffee con-
sumed in a day was associated with a 7% reduction in
the excess risk of diabetes relative risk, 0.93 [95% con-
fidence interval, 0.91-0.95]) after adjustment for poten-
tial confounders.

Conclusions: Owing to the presence of small-study bias,
our results may represent an overestimate of the true mag-
nitude of the association. Similar significant and inverse
associations were observed with decaffeinated coffee and
tea and risk of incident diabetes. High intakes of coffee,
decaffeinated coffee, and tea are associated with re-
duced risk of diabetes. The putative protective effects of
these beverages warrant further investigation in random-
ized trials.

B Y 2025, THE NUMBER OF IN IN-

dividuals estimated to be af-
fected by type 2 diabetes
mellitus (DM) will increase
by 65% to reach an esti-
mated 380 million individuals worldwide,
with the greatest burden being shouldered
by the lower- and middle-income coun-
tries of the Asia-Pacific region.1 Diabetes
mellitus causes substantial morbidity and
mortality in those affected and is associ-
ated with enormous economic, health, and
societal costs.2,3 Moreover, compared with
unaffected individuals, those with DM are
at greatly elevated risk of other chronic ill-
nesses, including cardiovascular disease, in
which cases DM more than doubles the risk
of having a heart attack or stroke.4,5 There-
fore, the identification of modifiable risk fac-
tors for the primary prevention of DM is of
considerable public health importance.

Despite considerable research atten-
tion, the role of specific dietary and life-

style factors remains uncertain, although
obesity6,7 and physical inactivity8 have con-
sistently been reported to raise the risk of
DM. Observational epidemiologic studies
have also suggested that high dietary in-
takes of fat, especially trans-fats,9 and red
meat10,11 are independently associated with
reduced insulin sensitivity and increased
risk of DM, and conversely, that high in-
takes of whole grains may be protec-
tive.5,9,12 Other studies have highlighted the
potential role that high intakes of coffee and
tea may have on reducing the likelihood of
developing DM.

An earlier meta-analysis suggested that
individuals with the highest level of cof-
fee consumption have approximately one-
third the risk of DM compared with those
with the lowest levels of consumption.13
However, since that review was pub-
lished, the amount of information that is
now available on the relationship be-
tween coffee consumption and subse-

quent risk of DM has more than
doubled.14-24 Furthermore, several
studies have also published data sug-
gesting that decaffeinated coffee and
tea may confer benefits similar to
those of regular coffee consump-
tion, although there has been no sys-
tematic evaluation of the evidence
for these beverages.16,17 Hence, the
purpose of the current report is to
update the previous meta-analysis of
the association between coffee con-
sumption and risk of DM and to con-
duct a supplementary overview of
the evidence for decaffeinated cof-
fee and tea consumption on subse-
quent risk.

METHODS

LITERATURE SEARCH

We performed a systematic review of
available literature according to the
MOOSE guidelines.25 Relevant studies
published between 1966 and July 2009
were identified from CINAHL, EMBASE,
PubMed, and the Cochrane Library using
a combined text and the following MeSH
heading search strategies: (caffeine OR
coffee OR decaffeinated OR tea) AND
(diabetes OR NIDDM OR adult-onset
diabetes OR glucose) AND (cohort OR
case-control). References from these
studies, as well from the previous re-
views, were also scrutinized to identify
other relevant studies. There was no lan-
guage restriction.

STUDY SELECTION

AND DATA EXTRACTION

Studies were included in this system-
atic review if they had published quan-
titative estimates (including variability)
of the association between intake of
total coffee, decaffeinated coffee, total
tea (including green and black) with
new-onset (incident) DM. Findings
had to be adjusted for at least age and
body mass index (BMI). We excluded
all animal studies and, in humans,
studies of type 1 DM. Given that a dis-
ease may plausibly affect dietary intake
(reverse causality), we also excluded
all cross-sectional studies and those
case-control studies with no informa-
tion on incident DM. Furthermore, we
excluded studies that classified con-
sumption only into a binary variable
(ie, yes or no) without specifying the
number of cups of beverage consumed
per day. The literature research and
data extraction were conducted by 2 of
the us (C.M.Y.L. and L.T.). Where
there was disagreement over the eligi-
bility of the study, 3 more of us
reviewed the article (R.H., F.B., and
S.C.), and a consensus was reached.

DATA SYNTHESIS

AND ANALYSIS

Given that most studies reported the as-
sociation between beverage consump-
tion and DM for more than 1 level of in-
take, an a priori decision was made to
pool the estimates of relative risk (RR)
that corresponded as closely as pos-
sible to between 3 and 4 cups of coffee,
decaffeinated coffee, or tea per day, com-
pared with none. A test for linear trend
of effects across coffee consumption cat-
egories was performed by regressing each
log RR on the ordered categorical vari-
able for coffee in 5 levels using a random-
effect meta-regression model. A log-
linear association between cups per day
and RR was fitted using generalized least
squares.26

For studies of specific types of tea
(black, green, and oolong), only 1 esti-
mate of the association with DM was re-
ported, and hence, we report on the as-
sociation with DM comparing tea
drinkers with non–tea drinkers. Sum-
mary estimates were obtained by means
of a random-effects model, and studies
were weighted according to an esti-
mate of statistical size defined as the in-
verse of the variance of the log RR.27 The
percentage of variability across studies
attributable to heterogeneity rather than
chance was estimated using the I2 sta-
tistic.28,29 Possible sources of heteroge-
neity were investigated by comparing

summary results obtained when stud-
ies were grouped according to statisti-
cal size, sex, method of diagnosis of DM,
and level of adjustment. Publication bias
was assessed taking, for each study, the
RR and 95% confidence interval (CI)
corresponding to the highest category of
coffee consumption using the Egger
test.30 All analyses were performed using
Stata software, version 10 (StataCorp LP,
College Station, Texas).

RESULTS

STUDY CHARACTERISTICS

The search strategy identified a total
of 2435 articles, of which 847 were
duplicates. After a review of 1588 ab-
stracts, 120 reports were reviewed
in full (Figure 1), and 20 of these,
all cohort studies, were included in
our review.14-24,31-40 The sample size
ranged from 910 to 88 259 and to-
taled 517 325 individuals, among
whom there were 21 897 cases of
new-onset DM (Table). Cohorts
were drawn from diverse popula-
tions, including Singapore,20 Puerto
Rico,15 the United Kingdom,17
Finland, 1 4 , 1 8 , 3 1 , 3 2 the United
States,16,21-23,34-36 Japan,17,40 the Neth-
erlands,38,39 and Sweden33 but in-
cluded predominantly white popu-
lations, with 21% of the data derived
from Asian cohorts (n = 110 147).
The studies represented both the
general population and specific
occupational groups. Age at com-
mencement of the studies ranged
from 20 to 98 years, and the me-
dian duration of follow-up ranged
from 2 to 20 years.

MEASUREMENT OF EXPOSURE

AND OUTCOME

Apart from 1 study, which used 24-
hour dietary recall to obtain an es-
timate of coffee consumption,15 all
of the remaining studies used self-
reported food frequency or self-
administered questionnaires. Dia-
betes mellitus was ascertained using
self-report of physician diagnoses,
routinely collected hospital admis-
sion records, or direct measure-
ment using an oral glucose toler-
ance test. Studies quantified the
association between beverage in-
take and DM using RR with accom-

There was evidence of a significant

inverse log-linear association such
that every additional cup of coffee
consumed in a day was associated
with a 7% reduction in the excess
risk of DM (RR, 0.93 [95% CI, 0.91-

evidence of significant heteroge-
neity across studies (P=.01) that was
not explained by differences in the
strength of effect between men and
women (RR, 0.78 [95% CI, 0.70-

ASSOCIATION BETWEEN
DECAFFEINATED COFFEE

CONSUMPTION AND

SUBSEQUENT RISK OF DM

Six studies (N = 225 516 partici-
pants) reported on the association
between decaffeinated coffee con-
sumption and subsequent risk of
DM. The pooled summary esti-
mates from these studies indicated
that individuals who drank more
than 3 to 4 cups of decaffeinated cof-
fee per day had an approximate one-
third lower risk of DM than those
consuming no decaffeinated coffee
(RR, 0.64 [95% CI, 0.54-0.77])
(Figure 3). There was little evi-
dence for either significant hetero-
geneity across included studies
(P=.31) or publication bias (P=.57
for Egger test).

ASSOCIATION BETWEEN TEA

CONSUMPTION AND

SUBSEQUENT RISK OF DM

A total of 7 studies (N=286 701 par-
ticipants) reported on the associa-
tion between tea consumption and
subsequent risk of DM. Pooled sum-
mary estimates indicated that indi-
viduals who drank more than 3 to 4
cups of tea per day had an approxi-
mate one-fifth lower risk of DM than
those consuming no tea (RR, 0.82
[95% CI, 0.73-0.94]) (Figure 3).

not possible to examine the potential
effect of confounding on the relation-
ship because none of the studies re-
ported both age- and multivariate-
adjusted estimates.

COMMENT

The findings from this meta-
analysis, based on over 500 000 in-

dividuals with over 21 000 cases of
new-onset DM, confirm an inverse
association between coffee consump-
tion and subsequent risk of DM: ev-
ery additional cup of coffee con-
sumed in a day was associated with
5% to 10% lower risk of incident DM
after adjustment for potential con-
founders. However, this may be an
overestimate of the true magnitude
of the association owing to the pres-
ence of small-study bias.

Furthermore, in the first over-
view of which we are aware, we were
able to demonstrate similar inverse
associations between consumption of
decaffeinated coffee and tea with risk

of incident DM. For example, indi-
viduals consuming more than 3 to 4
cups of tea a day had a one-fifth lower
risk of subsequent DM than non–
tea drinkers; those consuming a simi-
lar amount of decaffeinated coffee had
a one-third lower risk than noncon-
sumers. However, in the study by
Greenberg and colleagues,16 con-
sumption of decaffeinated coffee was
associated with a significant 40% re-
duction in the risk of DM only in

those aged 60 years or younger. In
older individuals, the direction of as-
sociation was reversed such that there
was a significant 40% increase in risk.
The observed age-related effect may
have been a statistical artifact driven
by subgroup analysis. However, we
were unable to examine the effect by
age, and the possibility that the as-
sociation between coffee and DM risk
is age dependent warrants further
investigation.

That the apparent protective
effect of tea and coffee consump-
tion appears to be independent of a
number of potential confounding
variables raises the possibility of di-
rect biological effects. Our findings
suggest that any protective effects of
coffee and tea are unlikely to be
solely effects of caffeine, but rather,
as has been speculated previously,
they likely involve a broader range
of chemical constituents present in

sium,41 lignans,42 and chlorogenic ac-
ids.43 The effects of these coffee com-
ponents on glucose metabolism and
insulin sensitivity from both ani-
mal studies and in vitro experi-
ments have been extensively re-
viewed elsewhere.44 While these
components have been demon-
strated to have beneficial effects on
biological pathways intimately in-
volved in glucose homeostasis and
insulin secretion, how these find-
ings relate to in vivo effects in hu-
mans is uncertain. Because most of
the studies included in this review
did not provide data on the effects
of these beverages or their compo-
nents on measures of hyperglyce-
mia and insulin sensitivity, we can-
not provide further evidence on the
mechanisms involved. In studies that
reported data on insulin sensitiv-
ity, findings were conflicting, with
some suggesting that coffee use in-
creased sensitivity to insulin,38,45
while others reported no effect.46
There have been few randomized
trials of the effects of coffee on glu-
cose and insulin, but 1 randomized
crossover trial of 4 weeks’ duration
of high coffee consumption re-
ported an increase in fasting insu-
lin levels but no effect on fasting glu-
cose concentration.47

Possible mechanisms of action for
tea on DM may involve 1 or more
physiologic pathways. For example,
tea catechins have been shown to in-
hibit the carbohydrate digestive en-
zymes, which suggests that glucose
production may be decreased in the
gastrointestinal system resulting in
lower levels of glucose and insu-
lin.48 Black, green, and oolong tea
have also been reported to increase
insulin sensitivity by increasing in-
sulin-stimulated glucose uptake in
adipocytes.49 There has also been the
suggestion that green tea may pre-
vent damage to pancreatic beta
cells.50,51 There have been several
small clinical intervention studies
conducted that have examined the ef-
fects of tea consumption on biomar-
kers of glucoregulatory control, but
the results from these studies have
been inconsistent. Some studies have
reported a significant reduction in
plasma glucose and hemoglobin A1c
levels,52,53 while others have re-
ported no effect on any aspect of glu-

coregulatory control.54 Given that di-
etary polyphenols are rapidly meta-
bolized, one explanation for the
discrepant findings between these
studies may have been the measure-
ment of the effects of tea on biomar-
kers at different times after its con-
sumption. For example, catechin
concentrations in human plasma
reach their maximum level at 2 hours
after ingestion of green tea but are un-
detectable after 24 hours.55

That there is a causal inverse as-
sociation between coffee consump-
tion and subsequent risk of DM is fur-
ther supported by the presence of a
dose-response relationship. In those
consuming more than 6 cups of cof-
fee per day, the risk of new-onset DM
was reduced by approximately 40%
compared with non–coffee drinkers,
while among those who drank less
than 1 cup per day, the risk was only
marginally reduced to about 4% com-
pared with coffee abstainers. More-
over, estimates were quite similar
across studies despite the diversity in
populations. Of note, this similarity
was presence in spite of the likely
presence of marked variation be-
tween studies in types of coffee and
tea and their preparation (eg, fil-
tered vs unfiltered, cup size, cup
strength, addition of milk or sugar,
and other variations). Finally, the re-
sults were consistent between stud-
ies regardless of which method of
diagnosis of DM was used (ie, self-
report vs national register or oral glu-
cose tolerance test).

An inherent weakness of all
observational studies and meta-
analyses thereof is the possibility that
any association is due to the pres-
ence of confounding. However, be-

cause high levels of coffee and tea
consumption have been reported to
be associated with risk behaviors that
are positively associated with the risk
of developing DM (such as low lev-
els of physical activity56 and ciga-
rette smoking57), it might be specu-
lated that adjustment for such risk
factors would strengthen the rela-
tionship as has been reported. We
examined the impact of confound-
ing on the relationship between cof-
fee consumption and subsequent
risk of DM by comparing crude and
adjusted estimates of effect from only
those studies that reported both es-
timates and observed that adjust-
ment for potential confounders had
no material impact (either a
strengthening or a weakening) on
the estimate of effect. However, we
were unable to conduct a similar
analysis for tea consumption be-
cause studies only reported the ad-
justed estimate. Tea drinkers may be
more health conscious than coffee
drinkers, and it is therefore plau-
sible that some of the observed ben-
eficial effect of tea on DM risk is due
in part to other health-promoting be-
haviors (eg, regular physical activ-
ity, weight maintenance, and non-
smoking) that may or may not have
been taken into consideration in the
original studies.

A further major limitation of this
analysis is the reliance on pub-
lished data, which precluded more
detailed analysis of the effect of ad-
justment for confounders at an in-
dividual level or for specific con-
founders separately. In this regard,
it is possible that individuals who
consume extreme quantities of cof-
fee differ in other important di-

more moderate coffee consumers,
but to examine this issue any fur-
ther would require an individual par-
ticipant data meta-analysis. There-
fore, the possibility that coffee
consumption may be acting as a sur-
rogate marker of some other di-
etary or lifestyle risk factor cannot
be fully excluded.

Finally, although the studies in-
cluded in this review were all pop-
ulation based, only 20% of the
cohorts were from nonwhite popu-
lations, which somewhat limits the
generalizability of the study findings
to largely Western populations. This
is an important consideration given
that the pattern of beverage consump-
tion and background risk of DM may
differ across ethnic groups.

In conclusion, high intake of cof-
fee, decaffeinated coffee, and/or tea
is associated with a material reduc-
tion in the risk of new-onset DM. If
such beneficial effects were ob-
served in interventional trials to be
real, the implications for the mil-
lions of individuals who have DM, or
who are at future risk of developing
it, would be substantial. For ex-
ample, the identification of the ac-
tive components of these beverages
would open up new therapeutic path-
ways for the primary prevention of
DM. It could also be envisaged that
we will advise our patients most at
risk for DM to increase their con-
sumption of tea and coffee in addi-
tion to increasing their levels of physi-
cal activity and weight loss.

ABSTRACT
Background: Low-fat vegetarian and vegan diets are associated
with weight loss, increased insulin sensitivity, and improved cardio-
vascular health.
Objective: We compared the effects of a low-fat vegan diet and
conventional diabetes diet recommendations on glycemia, weight,
and plasma lipids.
Design: Free-living individuals with type 2 diabetes were randomly
assigned to a low-fat vegan diet (n ¼ 49) or a diet following 2003
American Diabetes Association guidelines (conventional, n ¼ 50)
for 74 wk. Glycated hemoglobin (Hb A1c) and plasma lipids were
assessed at weeks 0, 11, 22, 35, 48, 61, and 74. Weight was mea-
sured at weeks 0, 22, and 74.
Results: Weight loss was signiﬁcant within each diet group but not
signiﬁcantly different between groups (24.4 kg in the vegan group
and 23.0 kg in the conventional diet group, P ¼ 0.25) and related
signiﬁcantly to Hb A1c changes (r ¼ 0.50, P ¼ 0.001). Hb A1c
changes from baseline to 74 wk or last available values were
20.34 and 20.14 for vegan and conventional diets, respectively
(P ¼ 0.43). Hb A1c changes from baseline to last available value
or last value before any medication adjustment were 20.40 and 0.01
for vegan and conventional diets, respectively (P ¼ 0.03). In analyses
before alterations in lipid-lowering medications, total cholesterol
decreased by 20.4 and 6.8 mg/dL in the vegan and conventional
diet groups, respectively (P ¼ 0.01); LDL cholesterol decreased by
13.5 and 3.4 mg/dL in the vegan and conventional groups, respec-
tively (P ¼ 0.03).
Conclusions: Both diets were associated with sustained reductions
in weight and plasma lipid concentrations. In an analysis controlling
for medication changes, a low-fat vegan diet appeared to improve
glycemia and plasma lipids more than did conventional diabetes diet
recommendations. Whether the observed differences provide clinical
beneﬁt for the macro- or microvascular complications of diabetes
remains to be established. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov

INTRODUCTION

Low-fat vegetarian and vegan diets are associated with re-
duced body weight, increased insulin sensitivity, and reductions
in cardiovascular risk factors (1–3). The potential cardiovascular
beneﬁts of vegetarian and vegan diets may be especially im-
portant for individuals with diabetes, for whom cardiovascular
disease is a main cause of premature mortality; the effects of

such diets on cardiovascular risk factors appear to be similar in
individuals with and without diabetes (3).

Prior studies have shown that near-vegetarian diets reduce the
need for insulin and oral medications in individuals with type
2 diabetes (4, 5). We previously reported that in individuals with
type 2 diabetes, a low-fat, vegan diet was associated with improved
glycemic control, weight loss, and improved plasma lipid con-
trol during a 22-wk study period (6). What is particularly critical
in diabetes management is long-term improvement in clinical
measures, particularly glycemia and cardiovascular risk factors.
Well-planned low-fat vegan diets are nutritionally adequate (7)
and, in research studies, have shown acceptability comparable
with that of other therapeutic diets (8–10), suggesting they are
suitable for long-term use. We therefore followed these study
participants for an additional year and now report the effects of a
low-fat vegan diet and a diet based on 2003 American Diabetes
Association (ADA) guidelines after 74 wk of study.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS

Participants

The study methods have been previously described (6). Brieﬂy,
individuals with type 2 diabetes, deﬁned by a fasting plasma
glucose concentration .125 mg/dL on 2 occasions or a prior
diagnosis of type 2 diabetes treated with medications for blood
glucose control for 6 mo, were recruited through newspaper
advertisements in the Washington, DC, area on 2 occasions
(October–December 2003 and October–December 2004) to com-

plete the study from January 2004 through June 2005 and Jan-
uary 2005 through June 2006, respectively. Exclusionary criteria
were a glycated hemoglobin (Hb A1c) ,6.5% or .10.5%; use of
insulin for .5 y; smoking, alcohol, or drug abuse; pregnancy;
unstable medical status; and current use of a low-fat vegetarian
diet. The protocol was approved by the George Washington Uni-
versity Institutional Review Board. All participants gave written
informed consent.

Hb A1c was assayed with the use of afﬁnity chromatography
on an Abbott IMx analyzer (Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park,
IL) (11). Volunteers were ranked in order of Hb A1c concen-
trations and randomly assigned in sequential pairs, using a random-
number table, to a low-fat vegan diet or a diet following 2003
ADA guidelines (12) (conventional diet group).

Intervention

The prescribed vegan diet (’10% of energy from fat, 15%
protein, 75% carbohydrate) consisted of vegetables, fruit, grains,
and legumes. Participants were asked to 1) avoid animal products
(ie, meats, dairy products, eggs); 2) avoid fatty foods, such as
added oils, fried products, avocados, nuts, and seeds; and 3)
favor low–glycemic index foods, such as beans and green veg-
etables. These diet changes increase dietary ﬁber and complex
carbohydrate at the expense of total and saturated fat, choles-
terol, and animal protein. Portion sizes, energy intake, and
carbohydrate intake were unrestricted.

The conventional diet (15–20% protein, ,7% saturated fat,
60–70% carbohydrate and monounsaturated fats; cholesterol
200 mg/d) was individualized, based on body weight and
plasma lipid concentrations, following 2003 ADA guidelines
(12). Participants in the conventional group with a body mass
index (in kg/m2) .25 (all but 3 participants) were prescribed
energy intake deﬁcits of 500–1000 kcal.

Participants were free living, and no meals were provided. To
meet the vitamin B-12 needs of the vegan group while maintaining
the same intervention in the conventional diet group, all partic-
ipants were provided a vitamin B-12 supplement (100 lg) to be
taken every other day. For both groups, alcoholic beverages were
limited to 1/d for women and 2/d for men. Participants were asked
not to alter exercise habits during the ﬁrst 22 wk of the study, but
they were free to alter their exercise regimens thereafter.

Each participant met for 1 h with a registered dietitian ex-
perienced in the use of the assigned diet to establish an appro-
priate diet plan. Thereafter, participants attended weekly 1-h
meetings of their assigned groups for nutrition and cooking in-
struction conducted by a physician and a registered dietitian or
a cooking instructor for 22 wk, followed by optional biweekly
sessions for an additional 52 wk. Sessions for the 2 groups
followed established curricula that were similar in duration and
content, except for dietary details.

At 7 points during the trial (weeks 4, 8, 13, 20, 33, 45, and 60),
a registered dietitian made unannounced telephone calls to each
participant to administer a 24-h diet recall, using a multipass
approach (Food and Nutrient Database 35, released May 2004,
software version 5.0; Nutrition Coordinating Center, University
of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN) (13) and reported instances of
poor dietary adherence to the dietitians responsible for the
initial dietary instruction for additional dietary counseling as
needed.

In addition, a 3-d dietary record was completed by each par-
ticipant at weeks 0, 11, 22, and 74 on 2 weekdays and 1 weekend
day, using a food scale, after participants had completed a 3-d
practice record. With the use of the NUTRITION DATA SYSTEM
FOR RESEARCH software (13), a registered dietitian certiﬁed by
the Nutrition Coordinating Center analyzed all 3-d dietary records
and diet recalls. For statistical purposes, dietary adherence for the
vegan group was deﬁned by 3 criteria: 1) the absence of meat,
poultry, ﬁsh, dairy, or egg intake in any 24-h recalls, 3-d dietary
records, or incidentally at any point; 2) saturated fat5% and total
fat 25% of energy on 3-d dietary records at 22 and 74 wk; and 3)
mean daily cholesterol intake 50 mg on 3-d dietary records at 22
and 74 wk. Adherence for the conventional diet group was deﬁned,
based on the 22- and 74-wk 3-d dietary records, as 1) mean daily
energy intake 200 kcal in excess of the prescribed intake and 2)
saturated fat 10% of energy. Individuals who attended ,10 of
the ﬁrst 22 weekly sessions were also considered nonadherent on
either diet. These adherence criteria were used for descriptive
purposes (not for participant teaching) and were not used in the
primary outcome analysis.

Participants were asked to continue their preexisting medi-
cation regimens, except when fasting plasma glucose determi-
nations were ,80 mg/dL (4.4 mmol/L) or hypoglycemic symptoms
were accompanied by a capillary glucose reading ,65 mg/dL
(3.6 mmol/L). In such cases, medications were reduced for
participant safety by a study endocrinologist who remained blind
to group assignment. Dosage adjustments followed an established
protocol, which generally called for 20% dosage reductions for
participants treated with insulin and 50% dosage reductions for
participants on oral agents. For those individuals for whom Hb
A1c at 22 wk was .8%, a single medication adjustment was
made, based on an established protocol, as follows: 1) partic-
ipants on insulin were prescribed a 10–20% increased dose, 2)
participants treated with oral agents could be raised to the max-
imal recommended dosages, and 3) participants on no medi-
cations were prescribed 2 mg/d glimepiride. Because medication
changes confound the interpretation of the effect of diet on gly-
cemia, analyses were designed to account for this factor to the
extent possible, as described below.

Outcome measures

Laboratory measurements were made after a 12-h fast by
technicians blind to group assignment. Hb A1c, plasma glucose,
and plasma lipids were assayed at weeks 0, 11, 22, 35, 48, 61,
and 74. All other measures were assessed at weeks 0, 22, and 74,
except as noted. Plasma glucose, cholesterol, triglyceride, and
urinary albumin were measured with the use of laboratory
methods previously described (6).

Physical activity was assessed over 3-d periods at weeks 0, 22,
and 74 by pedometer (Omron HJ-112; Omron Healthcare Inc,
Bannockburn, IL) and with the Bouchard 3-Day Physical Ac-
tivity Record (14). At weeks 1, 11, 22, and 74, body weight,
waist and hip circumference, and blood pressure were measured
as previously described (6).

Statistical analyses

To have an 80% chance of detecting as signiﬁcant (at the
2-sided 5% level) a 1.5-point between-group Hb A1c difference,

BARNARD ET AL

with an assumed SD of 1.9 and a loss to follow-up of 26%, 34
participants were required per group. An interim analysis in-
dicated group differences of 0.8 with SD of 1.3, so a revised
power analysis was conducted. To have an 80% chance of de-
tecting a 0.8 difference as signiﬁcant with an SD of 1.3 and loss
to follow-up of 33%, an additional 15 participants were required
per group. Data for the 2 cohorts were combined, such that the
74-wk observations were collected 74 wk after baseline deter-
minations for all participants.

The primary analysis of Hb A1c included all participants based
on intention to treat. Repeated-measures analysis of variance
was performed to see whether there were effects associated with
time (within-person variable), diet group (between-group vari-
able), or the interaction of time and diet group. The dependent
variable for the repeated-measures analysis was the Hb A1c
value at baseline and weeks 11, 22, 35, 48, 61, and 74.

Between-subjects t tests were calculated for Hb A1c, and all
other dependent measures to determine whether changes asso-
ciated with the intervention diet were greater than those asso-
ciated with the control diet. Within each diet group, paired
comparison t tests were calculated to test whether the change
from baseline to 74 wk, or last available value, was signiﬁcantly
different from zero. In cases of missing Hb A1c values, the last
available values were brought forward. Because medication
changes inﬂuence the dependent measures, additional analyses
were done by carrying forward the last values before any
medication changes for individuals whose medications for glu-
cose or lipid control had changed, and by limiting the analysis to
individuals with no medication changes. For body weight, ad-
ditional analyses were conducted with the use of baseline
weights for missing values. An a of 0.05 was used for all sta-
tistical tests, with no adjustment for multiple comparisons.

Regression analyses assessed whether the diet group effects
on Hb A1c and body weight were signiﬁcant while controlling
for baseline values, and whether the diet group effect on Hb
A1c was signiﬁcant while controlling for baseline Hb A1c and
changes in body weight. Pearson’s correlation coefﬁcients
were calculated for the relation between HB A1c change and
weight change. Between-group differences in diet adherence
were analyzed with the use of the chi-square test. The software
used was SAS for Windows, version 8.2 (SAS Institute Inc,
Cary, NC).

RESULTS

Of 1049 individuals screened by telephone, 99 met partici-
pation criteria and were randomly assigned to the vegan (n ¼ 49)
or conventional diet (n ¼ 50) groups. Reasons for exclusion
were Hb A1c values outside the required range (n ¼ 201), failure
to meet other participation criteria (n ¼ 279), inability to attend
scheduled meetings (n ¼ 187), failure to keep interview ap-
pointment (n ¼ 153), reluctance to change diet (n ¼ 72), and
other or unspeciﬁed (n ¼ 58). Demographic characteristics re-
ﬂected those of the Washington, DC, area (Table 1). Seven
vegan and 5 conventional diet participants failed to complete 74-
wk laboratory assessments. Nine vegan and 7 conventional diet
participants failed to complete 74-wk dietary records. No sig-
niﬁcant baseline clinical or demographic differences were ob-
served between these individuals and study completers.

Dietary intake, adherence, and medication changes

Both groups reduced energy intake (Table 2). The decreases in
total, saturated, monounsaturated, and trans fat intake and in
cholesterol intake, expressed in relation to energy intake, were
signiﬁcantly greater in the vegan group. Carbohydrate and ﬁber
intakes increased in the vegan group, with smaller changes in
these variables in the conventional diet group. For micro-
nutrients, compared with the conventional diet group, the vegan
group reported greater increases in vitamin C, folate, magne-
sium, and iron intakes and greater reductions in vitamin D,
calcium, and zinc intakes. Increases in fruit and vegetable intake
were greater in the vegan group. Pedometer readings and self-
reported energy expenditure showed no signiﬁcant between-
group differences. At 22 wk, all group-speciﬁc dietary adherence
criteria were met by 67% (33 of 49) of participants in the vegan
group and 44% (22 of 50) of participants in the conventional diet
group. At 74 wk, all dietary adherence criteria were met by 51%
(25 of 49) of participants in the vegan group and 48% (24 of 50)
of participants in the conventional diet group.

During the 74-wk study period, 71% (35 of 49) of participants
in the vegan group and 58% (29 of 50) of participants in the
conventional diet group altered their diabetes medications, either
as prescribed by the study protocol or without investigators’
authorization. Net 74-wk dosages were reduced in 17 (35%)
participants in the vegan group and 10 (20%) participants in the
conventional diet group, were increased in 7 (14%) participants in
the vegan group and 12 (24%) participants in the conventional
diet group, and were unchanged or mixed (changes in opposite
directions in 2 medications) in the remainder.

Body weight

When data from all participants from baseline to 74 wk or last
available value were included, both diets were associated with
signiﬁcant sustained weight reduction (24.4 kg in the vegan group
and 23.0 kg in the conventional diet group), with no signiﬁcant
difference between groups (P ¼ 0.25) (Table 3). Using baseline
values for missing values did not substantially change the out-
come (vegan group: 23.7 kg; conventional diet group: 22.6 kg;
between-group P ¼ 0.36). Limiting the analysis to participants
who met dietary adherence criteria at 22 and 74 wk (21 vegan, 16
conventional), weight loss was 6.8 kg in the vegan group and 4.9
kg in the conventional diet group (P ¼ 0.45).

Glycemic control

For Hb A1c,

the repeated-measures analysis of variance
showed signiﬁcant effects for time (P , 0.0001) and for diet
group-by-time interaction (P ¼ 0.03). The effects for time were
both linear and curvilinear. The group-by-time interaction was
followed with t test comparisons between groups for changes
from baseline to 74 wk. In an intention-to-treat analysis, in-
cluding all participants without regard to medication adjust-
ments, Hb A1c changes from baseline to 74 wk or to the last
available value were 20.34 for the vegan group and 20.14 for
the conventional diet group (P ¼ 0.43) (Table 3).

In an effort to remove the confounding effect of medication
changes, 2 additional analyses were conducted. Hb A1c changes
from baseline to 74 wk or to the last available value before any
medication adjustment were 20.40 and 0.01 in vegan and
conventional diet groups, respectively (P ¼ 0.03) (Table 4;

Figure 1). Among 74-wk completers whose medications re-
mained unchanged throughout (14 vegan, 21 conventional), Hb
A1c changes were 20.82 (vegan; within-group P ¼ 0.04) and
20.21 (conventional; within-group P ¼ 0.35) (P ¼ 0.14).

A regression model was constructed that included baseline Hb
A1c, weight change, and diet group as predictors of Hb A1c
change from baseline to 74 wk or last available value. In this
model, baseline Hb A1c (P , 0.0001) and weight change (P ¼
0.007) were associated with Hb A1c change, but the effect of diet
group was no longer signiﬁcant (P ¼ 0.12).

Controlling for diet group and baseline Hb A1c values, weight
change was signiﬁcantly associated with Hb A1c change; each
kilogram of weight loss was associated with a 0.09 decrease in
Hb A1c. For the subgroup with no net change in diabetes med-
ications (n ¼ 41), the Pearson’s correlation of weight change
with Hb A1c change was r ¼ 0.50, P ¼ 0.001.

Plasma lipids

Reductions in total, LDL-, and non–HDL-cholesterol con-
centrations from baseline to 74 wk (or to last available value)

were observed for both groups, as were reductions in triglyceride
and VLDL-cholesterol concentrations in the vegan group, with no
between-group differences in intention-to-treat analyses (Table
3). In analyses adjusted for medication changes, reductions in
LDL and non-HDL cholesterol were signiﬁcantly greater in the
vegan group (Table 4). No treatment-related serious adverse
events were observed.

DISCUSSION

In this 74-wk study, both diets were associated with signiﬁcant
weight loss. In analyses including all participants without regard
to medication changes, both diets were associated with reductions
in Hb A1c; the mean change was slightly but not signiﬁcantly
greater in the vegan group. In analyses controlling for medica-
tion changes, signiﬁcantly greater reductions were seen in Hb
A1c values and in total and LDL-cholesterol concentrations in
the vegan group.

Much of the effect of the intervention diets on glycemia
appears to be mediated by weight reduction. However, the 2 diets
appear to have altered energy intake by different mechanisms.

Although overweight individuals in the conventional diet group
were prescribed an explicit energy deﬁcit, a low-fat vegan diet
typically elicits signiﬁcant weight loss in the absence of pre-
scribed energy intake limits (2). This is likely because reduced
dietary fat and increased dietary ﬁber reduce dietary energy
density (15, 16).

Individuals following self-selected plant-based diets typically
have lower body weights, compared with omnivores (17). In a US
Department of Agriculture survey of 10,014 adults, vegetarians
and individuals on high-carbohydrate,
low-fat diets had the
lowest body mass indexes of the groups studied (18). In clinical
trials, the use of plant-based diets is associated with weight re-
duction that is partially preserved over the long term. In a study
that used a low-fat vegan diet without added exercise in over-
weight postmenopausal women, median weight reduction was
4.9 kg at 1 y and 3.1 kg at 2 y, both of which were greater than
weight changes associated with a comparison diet based on the
National Cholesterol Education Program guidelines (19). Among
individuals with cardiac disease, a lifestyle program that included
a low-fat vegetarian diet and mild exercise was associated with
net weight loss of 10.9 kg at 1 y and 5.8 kg at 5 y (20).

A vegan diet may also be associated with reductions in
intramyocellular lipid, which is strongly associated with insulin

sensitivity (21). A case-control study found that the median
soleus muscle intramyocellular lipid concentration was 31%
lower in a group of 21 vegans compared with 25 omnivores
matched for age and body weight (P ¼ 0.01) (22).

The long-term effect of both diet interventions on glycemia
was reduced in comparison with the short-term ﬁndings from this
study (6). Among participants in the vegan group with no
changes to diabetes medications, Hb A1c had fallen 1.23 by 22
wk (n ¼ 24) and 0.82 by 74 wk (n ¼ 14). Among medication-
stable participants in the conventional diet group, the Hb A1c
reduction was 0.38 at 22 wk (n ¼ 33), and 0.21 (n ¼ 21) at 74
wk. Both groups retained most of their weight loss, suggesting
that their diets had not returned to their baseline patterns.

The principal diet change in the conventional diet group was
a reduction in energy intake, which appears to be due to reduced
portion sizes rather than to changes in macronutrient balance,
which was close to the recommended percentages for protein,
carbohydrate, and monounsaturated fat at baseline and changed
only slightly during the study. This change in energy intake was
nonetheless sufﬁcient to lead to sustained weight loss. Several
studies that used conventional diets (23–26) have reported more
dramatic Hb A1c reductions (0.5–1.9%) than were observed in
the conventional diet group in our study. However, each of those

during this time changes in medications are likely to occur. We

Vegetarian and vegan diets are often more effective than other
diets for lipid control (27), an important consideration, given that
coronary heart disease is the main cause of mortality in diabetes.
The reduction in triglycerides associated with the vegan diet
contrasts with earlier studies suggesting that diets high in reﬁned
carbohydrate may transiently increase triglyceride concen-
trations for some individuals (2, 28). It appears that high-ﬁber,
low–glycemic index foods, such as were used in the present
study, have a salutary effect on triglyceride concentrations (29),
and the observed weight loss may also have contributed to tri-
glyceride reductions.

The acceptability of low-fat vegetarian and vegan diets has
been shown to be similar to that of other therapeutic diets in
studies of individuals with cardiovascular disease (8), young women
with dysmenorrhea (9), overweight but otherwise healthy post-
menopausal women (10), and the current study population (30).
Although low-fat vegan diets are generally lower in fat, satu-
rated fat, and cholesterol and higher in ﬁber and complex car-
bohydrate, compared with omnivorous diets (31, 32), planning is
important for micronutrient adequacy, particularly for sources of
vitamin B-12, vitamin D, and calcium (7).

The study’s strengths include its randomized design, extended
duration, inclusion of individuals with long-standing diabetes,
analysis of dependent measures without regard to variations in
dietary adherence, statistical methods aimed at reducing the
effect of medication changes, and applicability outside the re-
search setting. The study also has weaknesses. The medication
changes required for patient safety or for appropriate medical

management present a challenge in outpatient diabetes studies of
more than a few months’ duration. In the present study, most
participants in both groups altered medications, often because of
clinical success (low blood glucose values), presenting a con-
founding variable that required special analyses. Carrying for-
ward the last value before any medication change, as in the
current study, may either under- or overestimate effects (33, 34).
Limiting the analysis to those with no medication changes re-
duces sample size and statistical power. It is reassuring that all
statistical models (repeated-measures analysis, use of ﬁnal data
from all participants without regard to medication use or dietary
adherence, and use of the last value before medication change)
led to similar conclusions, showing a mean long-term Hb A1c–
lowering effect ranging from 0.3 to 0.4 units for the vegan group
and from 0 to 0.1 for the conventional diet group. Moreover, the
persistent mean weight loss conﬁrms the participants’ reports
that dietary changes were at least partially maintained.

In conclusion, in individuals with type 2 diabetes participating
in a research study, both a low-fat vegan diet and a diet based on
2003 ADA guidelines facilitated long-term weight reduction. In
analyses controlling for medication changes, the vegan diet
appeared to be more effective for control of glycemia and plasma
lipid concentrations. Whether the observed differences provide
clinical beneﬁt for the macro- or microvascular complications of
diabetes remains to be established. (Other articles in this sup-
plement to the Journal include references 35–61.)

Abstract
Objectives To summarise evidence on the association between white
rice consumption and risk of type 2 diabetes and to quantify the potential
dose-response relation.
Design Meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies.
Data sources Searches of Medline and Embase databases for articles
published up to January 2012 using keywords that included both rice
intake and diabetes; further searches of references of included original
studies.
Study selection Included studies were prospective cohort studies that
reported risk estimates for type 2 diabetes by rice intake levels.
Data synthesis Relative risks were pooled using a random effects
model; dose-response relations were evaluated using data from all rice
intake categories in each study.
Results Four articles were identified that included seven distinct
prospective cohort analyses in Asian and Western populations for this
study. A total of 13 284 incident cases of type 2 diabetes were
ascertained among 352 384 participants with follow-up periods ranging
from 4 to 22 years. Asian (Chinese and Japanese) populations had much
higher white rice consumption levels than did Western populations
(average intake levels were three to four servings/day versus one to two
servings/week). The pooled relative risk was 1.55 (95% confidence
interval 1.20 to 2.01) comparing the highest with the lowest category of
white rice intake in Asian populations, whereas the corresponding relative
risk was 1.12 (0.94 to 1.33) in Western populations (P for
interaction=0.038). In the total population, the dose-response
meta-analysis indicated that for each serving per day increment of white
rice intake, the relative risk of type 2 diabetes was 1.11 (1.08 to 1.14)
(P for linear trend<0.001).
Conclusion Higher consumption of white rice is associated with a
significantly increased risk of type 2 diabetes, especially in Asian
(Chinese and Japanese) populations.

Introduction
Humans have a long history of cultivating rice crops; rice was
first domesticated approximately 8000 to 9000 years ago by
people living in the region of the Yangtze River valley in
China.1-3 Rice is now grown worldwide and provides food for
more than half of the world’s population, especially those living
in some of the most populous countries, such as China, India,
and Japan. Polished rice or white rice, which primarily consists
of starch, is produced through a series of mechanised processes
including hulling and milling,4 and it is the predominant type
of rice consumed worldwide.5-7 Although the glycaemic index
value of a specific white rice variety depends on the degree of
processing, cooking time, and amylose content, the glycaemic
index values of white rice are higher on average than those of
whole grains.8 For example, the mean glycaemic index values
were 64 (SD 7) for white rice, 55 (5) for brown rice, 41 (3) for
whole wheat, and 25 (1) for barley in a previous meta-analysis.8
In addition, white rice is the primary contributor to dietary
glycaemic load for populations that consume rice as a staple
food.5 7
In large scale human observational studies among various
populations, diets with a high glycaemic index or glycaemic
load were associated with increased risk of developing type 2
diabetes.7 9-11 A significant positive association between white
rice consumption and risk of diabetes was observed among two
cohorts of Chinese and Japanese women,5 7 although the
association was not significant for Japanese men.5 Two
investigations in Western populations with much lower
consumption levels than Asian populations also generated mixed
results.12 13 These studies were heterogeneous with respect to
sample size, white rice intake levels, and other characteristics
that may contribute to inconsistencies in the literature. In
addition, whether any dose-response relation exists between

white rice consumption and risk of diabetes is unknown.
Therefore, we did a meta-analysis on all published prospective
cohort studies evaluating white rice intake and incidence of type
2 diabetes and quantified dose-response relations between intake
of white rice and risk of type 2 diabetes.
Methods
Search strategy
We did a literature search (up to January 2012) of Medline and
Embase for prospective cohort studies examining the association
between rice intake and risk of type 2 diabetes. The search terms
were (“Diabetes Mellitus”[Mesh] OR “diabetes”[All Fields])
AND (“Oryza sativa”[Mesh] OR “rice” OR “grain”) for Medline
and (‘diabetes’/exp OR diabetes) AND (‘rice’/exp OR rice OR
‘grain’/exp OR grain) for Embase. We supplemented this search
with a manual search of references cited by selected articles.
One investigator (QS) did this literature search.
Study selection
We applied the following inclusion criteria: prospective cohort
study, patients with self reported prevalent diabetes excluded
at baseline, and point estimates of relative risk with 95%
confidence intervals or standard errors available or derivable.
We excluded animal studies, clinical trials, cross sectional
studies, case-control studies, reviews, commentaries, letters,
and studies that examined other associations. We also applied
a criterion of study quality that all included cohort studies should
have a loss to follow-up rate below 20%. Two investigators
(EAH and AP) independently screened all studies by title or
abstract and then by a full text evaluation. Any discrepancy
between the two authors was solved by discussion with the
senior investigator (QS).
Data extraction
We extracted the following information from each study: study’s
characteristics (study name, authors, year of publication, journal,
study location, duration of follow-up, person time, and number
of participants and incident cases), participants’ characteristics
(age and sex), exposure (rice intake levels for each category)
and dietary assessment method, reproducibility and validity of
assessment method, outcome (type 2 diabetes) ascertainment,
and analysis strategy (statistical models, covariates included in
the models, and risk estimates in each category). For studies
that reported rice intake as servings per week or day, we
converted it to grams per day by assuming that each serving
was equivalent to 158 g of cooked rice. To convert raw rice
intake levels to cooked rice consumption levels for Villegas et
al’s study, we multiplied raw intake levels by a factor of 2.5.7
Two investigators (EAH and AP) extracted data independently,
and any discrepancies were resolved by discussion. For two
studies that expressed data separately for men and women or
included data from multiple cohorts,5 13 we considered the
analysis for each sex or cohort as an independent report and
extracted data separately. As per our request, Hodge et al
provided the number of cases and person years for each rice
intake category in their study and confirmed that white rice
accounted for the vast majority (approximately 95%) of total
rice consumption in their study (Allison Hodge, email
communication).12 To assess the quality of included studies, we
derived a score that summarised 15 aspects of each study,
including study design, response rate, follow-up rate, follow-up
time, exposure and outcome measurements, and statistical
analysis (supplementary table A).

Statistical analysis
Hazard ratios (equivalent to relative risks in cohort studies) were
used as the common measure of association in all studies except
for those by Nanri et al and Hodge et al, which used logistic
regression to model the association of interest. Because of the
very low incidence of type 2 diabetes in these two studies (five
year risk was 1.9% for Nanri et al’s study and 1.2% for Hodge
et al’s study), we considered odds ratios to be relatively accurate
estimates of the true relative risks. We further derived estimates
of person time for Nanri et al’s study by multiplying the number
of participants by the follow-up time for each category of rice
intake. We pooled all relative risks by using a random effects
model comparing extreme categories of intake and set study
weights to be equal to the inverse variance of each study’s effect
estimate. We produced forest plots to assess the multivariate
adjusted relative risks and corresponding 95% confidence
intervals visually across studies. We evaluated heterogeneity
of relative risks across studies by using the Cochrane Q statistic
(we considered P<0.05 to be indicative of statistically significant
heterogeneity) and the I2 statistic. We did stratified analyses
according to ethnicity (Asian versus Western). To evaluate
potential interactions between rice intake and ethnicity, we used
Altman et al’s method to evaluate whether the pooled relative
risks differed between different ethnic groups.14 We also fitted
a fixed effects model to examine the between group
heterogeneity and used the P value for heterogeneity to evaluate
the interactions. We used Begg funnel plots and Egger’s tests
to assess potential publication bias.15
To evaluate a potential non-linear dose-response relation, we
first used a restricted cubic spline regression model (Stata
RC_SPLINE command) with three knots to create spline
variables that we subsequently used in our analysis to derive
the generalised least squares trend estimation of pooled
dose-response data (Stata GLST command).16 17 We then fitted
another regression model without the spline terms. Lastly, we
used the likelihood ratio test to examine the significance of any
non-linearity by comparing the model with the linear term only
and the model with both the linear and the cubic spline terms.
This analysis used data from the relative risks and 95%
confidence intervals, number of cases and person years, and
median/mean of rice intake levels for each comparison group.
Median intake levels for each rice consumption category were
available in Nanri et al’s study.5 For all other studies that did
not provide such data, we calculated the average of the two
extreme values of each comparison group to determine mean
rice intake levels. For the highest consumption category, we
assumed that the average consumption level was the cut-off
point plus a 25% increment, which was largely consistent with
Nanri et al’s study. Because of unstable estimators in a random
effects cubic spline model as a result of lack of power, we used
a fixed effects model to evaluate the dose-response relation. We
calculated absolute risk differences as background incidence
rate×(relative risk−1).
We used Stata statistical software version 11.0 for all analyses.
P values were two sided with a significance level of 0.05.

studies because they did not separate rice from other
carbohydrate sources, 16 because no original data could be
extracted (reviews, letters, or cross sectional studies), 10 that
we deemed irrelevant, and one that had a loss to follow-up rate
of 31.7%.18 Finally, four studies met the inclusion criteria and
were included in the meta-analysis. A manual search of
references cited by these studies did not yield new eligible
articles. Among these four studies, Nanri et al’s study examined
men and women separately and Sun et al’s report included data
from three independent cohorts. Therefore, we included seven
comparisons in the meta-analysis.
Study characteristics
Tables 1⇓ and 2⇓ show the characteristics of the included
studies. All four studies were prospective cohort studies in
participants who were free of self reported diabetes at baseline
(total n=352 384). Hodge et al’s study further excluded any
patients with diabetes whose date of diagnosis was before the
study baseline even though they did not report having a
diagnosis of diabetes at baseline interview. Among the
participants, 13 284 incident cases of diabetes occurred during
follow-up periods ranging from four to 22 years. Two studies
were done in Asian populations (China and Japan) and the other
two studies in Western populations (the United States and
Australia). Average rice intake levels varied dramatically across
studies. For example, in the Chinese study the mean intake level
of cooked rice was approximately four servings (625 g) per day,
whereas in the two studies done in the United States and
Australia most (98% for the US study and 71% for the
Australian study) participants consumed less than five servings
a week. In all studies, dietary intake was assessed by food
frequency questionnaires, which were validated against multiple
day diet records or 24 hour recalls. Moderate correlation
coefficients of dietary intake of rice have been found (ranged
from 0.53 to 0.66), supporting reasonably good validity of rice
intake assessment in these studies. Results from our assessment
of study quality showed that most studies achieved a score of
12 or above (the maximum score was 15) except for Hodge et
al’s study, which achieved a score of 7 (supplementary table
A).
White rice intake and risk of type 2 diabetes
Figure 2⇓ summarises the comparisons of the highest and lowest
categories of white rice intake levels. Overall, the random effects
model summarising all seven comparisons suggested a positive
association; the pooled relative risk was 1.27 (95% confidence
interval 1.04 to 1.54), although significant heterogeneity was
detected (I2=72.2%; Cochrane Q test P=0.001). With
stratification by ethnicity, the association was stronger for Asian
populations (pooled relative risk 1.55, 1.20 to 2.01) than for
Western populations (1.12, 0.94 to 1.33). In both strata, the P
for heterogeneity was not significant (P=0.17 and P=0.13). The
difference in the pooled relative risks between these two groups
reached statistical significance (P=0.038), suggesting an
interaction between rice intake and ethnicity. Similarly, when
we used a fixed effects model to examine between ethnic group
heterogeneity, we found a significant P for heterogeneity
(P<0.001). The funnel plot and Egger’s test (P=0.30) did not
suggest evidence of publication bias (supplementary figure A).
Dose-response relation between white rice
intake and diabetes risk
In a fixed effects cubic spline model that included all studies,
we did not find evidence suggesting any non-linear relation

between white rice consumption and risk of diabetes (P for
non-linearity=0.51) (fig 3⇓). For each serving per day increment
of white rice consumption, the relative risk was 1.11 (1.08 to
1.14; P for linear trend<0.001). Using the incidence rate of
diabetes in the middle aged US population (15.2 cases/1000
population aged 45-64 years),19 we estimated that 167 cases of
diabetes per 100 000 middle aged people would occur each year
for each serving per day increase in consumption of white rice.
(These estimates may underestimate the risk difference for Asian
populations that are experiencing an accelerated incidence rate
of diabetes.20) To illustrate this, we further plotted the incidence
rate of diabetes by intake levels for each comparison category
in Asian and Western populations (supplementary figure B).
Secondary analysis
We did several secondary analyses to examine the robustness
of the primary results. Firstly, we evaluated a potential
interaction by sex. Because Hodge et al’s did not separate men
from women in their analysis, we excluded this study in this
secondary analysis. The association was more pronounced
among women (pooled relative risk 1.46, 1.16 to 1.83) than men
(1.08, 0.87 to 1.34) (supplementary figure C). Secondly, we
excluded Hodge et al’s study, which had a lower quality score
than other studies and did not separate white rice from brown
rice. This analysis yielded a pooled relative risk of 1.17 (0.97
to 1.42) comparing the highest and lowest categories in Western
populations. The relative risk was 1.33 (1.09 to 1.63) for all
populations, and a significant P for heterogeneity (P=0.006)
was still present in this analysis. Lastly, when we included Yu
et al’s study among Chinese people living in Hong Kong,18
which was excluded from the primary analysis because of a
high rate of loss to follow-up, we found similar associations;
comparing the highest and the lowest categories, the pooled
relative risk was 1.45 (1.11 to 1.89) for Asian populations and
1.24 (1.03 to 1.50) for total populations.
Discussion
In this meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies, we found
that higher white rice consumption was associated with a
significantly elevated risk of type 2 diabetes. This association
seems to be stronger for Asians than for Western populations.
A dose-response analysis showed that each serving per day of
white rice consumption was associated with an 11% increase
in risk of diabetes in the overall population.
Strengths and limitations
Several caveats of this meta-analysis are worth discussing.
Firstly, although the ethnicity stratified analysis did not show
significant heterogeneity within each group, the limited number
of studies may lead to diminished statistical power for detecting
heterogeneity within each stratum. Secondly, although we
included the results from only the fully adjusted models, because
all individual studies were observational in nature the results
of these studies may still be subject to residual confounding or
other biases. Confounding by socioeconomic status is of
particular concern because this is both a risk factor for type 2
diabetes and a predictor of rice consumption in Asian and
Western populations.5 7 21-24 However, the US studies consisted
of participants from the same professional background, so
confounding by socioeconomic status was likely to be small.
In addition, other studies controlled for indicators of
socioeconomic status such as income and education.
Nevertheless, residual confounding by socioeconomic status
cannot be completely ruled out in these studies. Depending on

the nature of uncontrolled or residual confounding, the
associations seen in these individual studies and our
meta-analysis could be biased in either direction. Large scale
pooling projects, in which covariate adjustments and statistical
analysis can be standardised, are needed to confirm the findings
of this meta-analysis. Likewise, the dose-response relation could
be more precisely modelled in such pooling projects.
Thirdly, all studies used food frequency questionnaires to assess
levels of white rice intake. Although validation studies showed
reasonable reproducibility and validity of self reported rice
intake, measurement error is inevitable. Measurement error in
assessment of exposure may lead to attenuation of true
associations in a prospective study, especially when the exposure
was assessed before disease assessment. Fourthly, although all
studies excluded cases of self-reported diabetes at baseline,
some undiagnosed cases may still be included in the analysis.
However, the effect of such a bias is likely to be small. In the
US studies, self reported diagnosis of diabetes was highly
accurate; the Australian study further excluded any cases with
a diagnosis date before baseline, even if they did not report
diabetes at baseline interview; and in Asian studies, because
rice is a staple food, substantial reduction of rice consumption
after diagnosis of diabetes is unlikely. Lastly, we were unable
to include brown rice in this meta-analysis or to evaluate the
effects of substituting brown rice for white rice, because the
association between brown rice and risk of diabetes was
examined only in Sun et al’s study.13
The strengths of this meta-analysis include the large sample
size and long duration of follow-up of the included studies. In
addition, most established risk factors for type 2 diabetes were
adjusted for in the fully adjusted models in these studies.
Moreover, inclusion of studies in both Asian and Western
countries allowed us to investigate the dose-response relation
on the basis of a wide spectrum of white rice intake levels.
Results in relation to other studies
Several potential mechanisms could explain the association
between white rice consumption and risk of type 2 diabetes.
Among Asian populations, which consume white rice as a staple
food, white rice is the predominant contributor to dietary
glycaemic load. For example, in women living in Shanghai,
white rice accounted for 73.9% of dietary glycaemic load7; in
Japanese women, white rice explained 58.5% of dietary
glycaemic load.25 In a meta-analysis that pooled data from cohort
studies primarily done in Western populations, dietary glycaemic
load was consistently associated with increased risk of
developing type 2 diabetes.26 Similarly, recent investigations in
Chinese and Japanese populations also support the hypothesis
that high dietary glycaemic load is associated with increased
risk of diabetes.7 25 27 The relatively weaker association for
Western populations seen in this meta-analysis may be due to
the fact that white rice intake was much lower than in Asians
and, therefore, was only a minor contributor to dietary glycaemic
load. In addition, the glycaemic index values of various white
rice varieties depend on several factors including amylose
content, other botanical structures, and processing methods.8 28-30
The contribution of white rice to dietary glycaemic load may
vary substantially, especially when consumption levels are low.
Nonetheless, high intake of white rice may also lead to increased
risk of diabetes through mechanisms other than its contribution
to dietary glycaemic load. Compared with minimally processed
whole grains such as brown rice, white rice has a lower content
of many nutrients including insoluble fibre, magnesium,
vitamins, lignans, phytoestrogens, and phytic acid, which are
lost during the refining process.31 Some of these nutrients,

especially insoluble fibre and magnesium, have been associated
with lower risk of type 2 diabetes in prospective cohort
studies.9 10 32-36 Thus, a high consumption of white rice may lead
to increased risk of diabetes because of the low intake of
beneficial nutrients, in addition to its higher glycaemic load.
Meanwhile, more data are needed to shed light on whether the
interaction by ethnicity is due simply to substantially different
white rice intake levels or to other mechanisms.
Data on the association between brown rice intake and type 2
diabetes are limited. In Sun et al’s work in Western populations,
brown rice intake was associated with a modestly decreased
risk of type 2 diabetes, and the substitution of brown rice or
other whole grains for white rice was associated with a
significantly lower risk of diabetes.13 Because Asian populations
consume white rice almost exclusively, no data on the relation
between brown rice and risk of diabetes are available in these
populations. Nevertheless, a 16 week clinical trial in 76 Korean
men showed that isocaloric replacement of white rice with whole
grains and legume powder (composed of 66.6% whole grains,
22.2% legumes, 5.6% seeds, and 5.6% vegetables) led to
significant reductions in serum glucose and insulin
concentrations, whereas body weight remained unchanged.37
However, a recent study in Shanghai found that substituting
brown rice for white rice for 16 weeks did not substantially
affect metabolic markers in middle aged men and women,
although high density lipoprotein cholesterol and diastolic blood
pressure were significantly improved among people with
diabetes through the brown rice intervention.38 More studies
with larger sample sizes and longer durations of follow-up are
warranted to examine the effects of substituting brown rice for
white rice on risk of diabetes.
Conclusions
In summary, this meta-analysis suggests that higher white rice
intake is associated with a significantly elevated risk of type 2
diabetes, especially among Asian populations. The recent
transition in nutrition characterised by dramatically decreased
physical activity levels and much improved security and variety
of food has led to increased prevalence of obesity and insulin
resistance in Asian countries.39 Although rice has been a staple
food in Asian populations for thousands of years, this transition
may render Asian populations more susceptible to the adverse
effects of high intakes of white rice, as well as other sources of
refined carbohydrates such as pastries, white bread, and sugar
sweetened beverages. In addition, the dose-response relations
indicate that even for Western populations with typically low
intake levels, relatively high white rice consumption may still
modestly increase risk of diabetes.

What is already known on this topic

The association between white rice consumption and risk of type 2 diabetes has been examined in both Asian and Western populations,
but the findings are not entirely consistent across studies
The substantial difference in baseline rice intake levels between Asians and other populations for whom rice is not a staple food may
contribute to the inconsistency of existing results
However, a systematic and quantitative summary of published studies to date is not available

What this study adds

Pooled data suggest that higher white rice consumption is associated with increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes in comparison
with lower intake levels
This association is stronger for Asian (Chinese and Japanese) populations than for Western populations
Overall, there was a dose-response relation between higher intake of white rice and increasing risk of diabetes

Background

A B S T R A C T

Diet as one aspect of lifestyle is thought to be one of the modiﬁable risk factors for the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).
Information is needed as to which components of the diet could be protective for this disease.

Objectives

To asses the effects of whole-grain foods for the prevention of T2DM.

Search methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and AMED.

Selection criteria

We selected cohort studies with a minimum duration of ﬁve years that assessed the association between intake of whole-grain foods or
cereal ﬁbre and incidence of T2DM. Randomised controlled trials lasting at least six weeks were selected that assessed the effect of a
diet rich in whole-grain foods compared to a diet rich in reﬁned grain foods on T2DM and its major risk factors.

Data collection and analysis

Two authors independently selected the studies, assessed study quality and extracted data. Data of studies were not pooled because of
methodological diversity.

Main results

One randomised controlled trial and eleven prospective cohort studies were identiﬁed. The randomised controlled trial, which was
of low methodological quality, reported the change in insulin sensitivity in 12 obese hyperinsulinemic participants after six-week
long interventions. Intake of whole grain foods resulted in a slight improvement of insulin sensitivity and no adverse effects. Patient
satisfaction, health related quality of life, total mortality and morbidity was not reported.

Four of the eleven cohort studies measured cereal ﬁbre intake, three studies whole grain intake and two studies both. Two studies
measured the change in whole grain food intake and one of them also change in cereal ﬁbre intake. The incidence of T2DM was
assessed in nine studies and changes in weight gain in two studies. The prospective studies consistently showed a reduced risk for high
intake of whole grain foods (27% to 30%) or cereal ﬁbre (28% to 37%) on the development of T2DM.

Authors’ conclusions

The evidence from only prospective cohort trials is considered to be too weak to be able to draw a deﬁnite conclusion about the
preventive effect of whole grain foods on the development of T2DM. Properly designed long-term randomised controlled trials are
needed. To facilitate this, further mechanistic research should focus on ﬁnding a set of relevant intermediate endpoints for T2DM and
on identifying genetic subgroups of the population at risk that are most susceptible to dietary intervention.

P L A I N L A N G U A G E S U M M A R Y

Whole grain foods for the prevention of type 2 diabetes mellitus

Food products derived from cereal grains as wheat, rice, corn, rye, oat, and barley constitute a major part of the daily diet in many
countries. In reﬁned-grain products, the bran and germ of the grain, which contain the major amount of nutrients and dietary ﬁbre,
have been removed and only the starchy inner part of the grain (ca. 80% of the whole grain) is used. Whole grain foods contain either
intact, ﬂaked or broken grain kernels, coarsely ground kernels or ﬂour that is made from whole grains (whole-meal ﬂour). In this review
the effect of whole grain foods and cereal ﬁbre (as a marker of whole-grain food intake) on the prevention of type 2 diabetes mellitus
(T2DM) was assessed using all available prospective cohort studies and randomised controlled trials. Only one randomised controlled
trial was found which was of low methodological quality. This study investigated in 12 overweight persons during six weeks the effect
of the consumption of reﬁned grain foods versus that of whole grain foods on insulin sensitivity (risk factor for the development of
T2DM). Intake of whole grain foods resulted in a slight improvement of insulin sensitivity, increased bowel movements and no adverse
effects. No information was given about patient satisfaction, health related quality of life, total mortality and morbidity. In addition
eleven prospective cohort studies were found. One study was conducted in Finland and the rest in the United States of America of
which seven were done in health care workers. Some of the studies were of limited quality. They consistently showed that a high intake
of whole grain foods or cereal ﬁbre is associated with a lower risk of the development of T2DM. However, evidence for a protective
effect coming from prospective cohort studies only has to be considered as weak as with this design no cause and effect relationship
can be established. Well-designed randomised controlled trials are needed to be able to draw deﬁnite conclusions about the preventive
effects of whole grain consumption on development of T2DM.

Description of the condition

Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder resulting from a defect
in insulin secretion, insulin action, or both. A consequence of this
is chronic hyperglycaemia (i.e. elevated levels of plasma glucose)
with disturbances of carbohydrate, fat and protein metabolism.
Long-term complications of diabetes mellitus include retinopa-
thy, nephropathy and neuropathy. The risk of cardiovascular dis-
ease is increased. For a detailed overview of diabetes mellitus,
please see under ’Additional information’ in the information on
the Metabolic and Endocrine Disorders Group in The Cochrane
Library (see ’About the Cochrane Collaboration’, ’Collaborative
review groups - CRGs’). For an explanation of methodological
terms, see the main glossary in The Cochrane Library.

Description of the intervention

Type 2 diabetes is the most prevalent form of diabetes worldwide
and develops as a consequence of two defects. In an early stage
target tissues are unable to respond to normal circulating concen-
trations of insulin (insulin resistance). As a consequence the out-
put of insulin from the pancreatic beta-cells is increased (hyper-
insulinemia) to maintain normal blood glucose levels. In a later
stage insulin secretion may decline as a result of beta-cell dysfunc-
tion. This leads to impaired glucose tolerance, impaired fasting
glycaemia (glucose values above the normal range but below those
deﬁned as diagnostic of diabetes) or both which are associated with
an increased risk of type 2 diabetes (Unwin 2002; WHO 1999).
Excessive weight gain and central obesity are other well established
risk factors for the development of type 2 diabetes (FAO/WHO
2003). The incidence of obesity and type 2 diabetes are increasing
rapidly worldwide and pose enormous economic as well as social
costs to societies, urging for preventive measures. Although ge-
netic elements are involved in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes,

the rapid changes in incidence rates suggest a particularly impor-
tant role for environmental factors. Besides physical activity, diet
is thought to play a key role as a modiﬁable risk factor. Charac-
teristics of a diet favouring the development of obesity and type 2
diabetes are currently deﬁned as high in saturated fat and energy-
dense foods as well as low in fruit and vegetables (FAO/WHO
2003). The contribution of the type of starchy food - an important
component of the diet worldwide - however, has not been estab-
lished well. Starchy foods are derived mainly from cereal grains
which undergo a reﬁning process or will be used entirely (whole
grain foods).

How the intervention might work

Food products derived from cereals as wheat, rice, corn, rye, oat,
and barley constitute a major part of the daily diet in many coun-
tries (FAO 1998). In reﬁned-grain products, the bran and germ of
the grain which contain the major amount of micronutrients, phy-
tochemicals and dietary ﬁbre (non-digestible carbohydrates and
lignin), have been removed and only the starchy endosperm (ca.
80% of the whole grain) is used. Whole grain foods contain ei-
ther intact, ﬂaked or broken grain kernels, coarsely ground ker-
nels or ﬂour that is made from whole grains (whole-meal ﬂour).
In epidemiological studies foods commonly are classiﬁed as whole
grain as they contain more than 25% by weight whole-grain or
bran (Jacobs 1998). The Food and Drug Administration (FDA
2005) has approved a health claim for whole-grain foods with a
whole-grain content of more than 51% by weight per reference
amount customarily consumed and more recently has announced
in a FDA guidance document (draft guidelines) that it “considers
’whole grain’ to include cereal grains that consist of the intact,
ground, cracked or ﬂaked fruit of the grains whose principal com-
ponents -- the starchy endosperm, germ and bran -- are present
in the same relative proportions as they exist in the intact grain”
(FDA 2006).
Changes in food patterns such as a decrease of consumption of
whole grain foods which occurred simultaneously with the increase
of prevalence of chronic disease over the last decades have lead to
the hypothesis that constituting whole grain food by highly reﬁned
grain foods is linked to the development of type 2 diabetes and
other chronic diseases (Burkitt 1975; Trowell 1975). There are
several hypotheses as to how whole grain foods might prevent type
2 diabetes. Beneﬁcial effects on weight gain, for example, could be
explained by the larger volume and relatively low energy density of
whole grain food which is due to the presence of cereal ﬁbre. This
promotes satiation and satiety thus leading to decreased energy
intake (Koh-Banerjee 2003). Consumption of whole grain foods
containing intact, broken or coarsely ground kernels or viscous
soluble ﬁbre, results in a lower postprandial plasma glucose and
insulin response as compared to reﬁned grain foods (Slavin 2003).
In view of the proposed aggravating effects of high postprandial
glucose and insulin concentrations on insulin sensitivity and beta-

cell failure, their suppression is considered to be beneﬁcial (Ludwig
2002; Willett 2002). Also, the high content of antioxidants such as
vitamin E, phytic acid and selenium might be advantageous (Slavin
2003) since there is emerging evidence that the pathogenesis of
diabetes is associated with increased oxidative stress (Dandona
2004; Robertson 2004; Sjoholm 2005).
From observational studies there is evidence for a protective effect
of whole-grain foods with regard to the development of type 2
diabetes (Fung 2002; McKeown 2002; Meyer 2000; Montonen
2003). More recently, higher intake of whole grains was also asso-
ciated with decreases in insulin resistance - a risk factor related to
the development of type 2 diabetes (Liese 2003; McKeown 2004;
Steffen 2003).
However, the protective effect of whole-grain foods on the de-
velopment of type 2 diabetes would ideally be evaluated by ran-
domised control trials because of their optimal control of con-
founding factors. To be able to observe differences in incidence
of type 2 diabetes the duration of the dietary intervention would
need to be very long. Alternatively, persons with at least one major
risk factors for type 2 diabetes could be chosen. Amelioration of
the risk factor could then be used as an indication of decreased risk
of development of type 2 diabetes. Still, it is likely that compli-
ance with the whole-grain diet decreases with time, especially in
persons who regard the diet as less palatable or might experience
adverse effects of the intervention. The relatively high content of
cereal ﬁbre and resistant starch in the whole-grain diet might cause
increased bloating, ﬂatulence or both in sensitive persons. Due to
these limitations with regard to trial duration and compliance ran-
domised controlled trials assessing the effect of whole-grain foods
on the development of type 2 diabetes are likely to be scarce.

Why it is important to do this review

Some reviews have been published addressing the relation be-
tween whole grain foods and the incidence of type 2 diabetes (Liu
2002; Murtaugh 2003). However, they were not systematically
performed with respect to literature search and did not include
quality assessment. Summarizing and evaluating the available ev-
idence -derived from prospective cohort studies and intervention
trials - concerning the possible protective effect of whole grain
foods could aid in identifying further research need and assist in
deﬁning recommendations with regard to the intake of starchy
foods for the prevention of the development of type 2 diabetes.

Cohort studies

Criteria for considering studies for this review

Inclusion criteria

Free living persons (older than 18 years of age) without previously
diagnosed diabetes mellitus.

Types of studies

Randomised controlled trials, controlled clinical trials and cohort
studies were considered.

Diagnostic criteria

Types of participants

Randomised controlled trials or controlled clinical trials

Inclusion criteria

Healthy persons and persons with at least one major risk factor for
type 2 diabetes were included. Major risk factors are overweight,
abdominal obesity, impaired glucose tolerance and insulin resis-
tance. We excluded children and adolescents less than 18 years
because of the well known differences in eating patterns.

Diagnostic criteria

Type 2 diabetes and impaired glucose tolerance: the diagnosis
should have been established using the standard criteria valid at
the time of the beginning of the trial (ADA 1997; ADA 1999;
NDDG 1979; Unwin 2002; WHO 1980; WHO 1985; WHO
1999).

Overweight

Type 2 diabetes and impaired glucose tolerance: the diagnosis
should have been established using the standard criteria valid at
the time of the beginning of the trial (ADA 1997; ADA 1999;
NDDG 1979; Unwin 2002; WHO 1980; WHO 1985; WHO
1999).

Overweight

Body mass index greater than 25 (body mass in kg / height in (m
2)) (FAO/WHO 2003).

Abdominal obesity

Waist circumference equal to or more than 102 cm in men and
equal to or more than 88 cm in women (FAO/WHO 2003).

Insulin resistance

Cut-off values for deﬁning insulin resistance vary since different
methods are used for assessment of insulin resistance (Monzillo
2003). Under hyperinsulinemic, euglycemic conditions, glucose
uptake below lowest quartile for background population under
investigation is deﬁned as insulin resistance according to the WHO
(WHO 1999).

Body mass index greater than 25 (body mass in kg / height in (m
2)) (FAO/WHO 2003).

Types of interventions

Abdominal obesity

Waist circumference equal to or more than 102 cm in men and
equal to or more than 88 cm in women (FAO/WHO 2003).

Insulin resistance

Cut-off values for deﬁning insulin resistance vary since different
methods are used for assessment of insulin resistance (Monzillo
2003). Under hyperinsulinemic, euglycemic conditions, glucose
uptake below lowest quartile for background population under
investigation is deﬁned as insulin resistance according to the WHO
(WHO 1999).

Randomised controlled trials or controlled clinical trials

Trials were included which compared diets rich in whole-grain
foods (foods that contain more than 51% of whole grain) with
diets rich in reﬁned-grain foods. Both diets should have similar
overall sugar, starch, fat and protein content.

Cohort studies

Studies had to assess the intake of whole-grain foods (foods that
contain more than 25% of whole grain) or cereal ﬁbre (as marker
for whole grain food intake).

Types of outcome measures

Timing of outcome assessment

Primary outcomes

Prospective studies had to have of a minimum duration of ﬁve
years.

Randomised controlled trials or controlled clinical trials

Search methods for identiﬁcation of studies

Ideally incidence of type 2 diabetes is the main outcome.
However, it was anticipated that there are hardly any randomised
controlled trials or controlled clinical trials assessing the inci-
dence of type 2 diabetes because of the long intervention duration
needed.
Therefore, also trials assessing the changes in major risk factors
for type 2 diabetes, including impaired glucose tolerance, insulin
resistance and overweight were considered.

Cohort studies

• Incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Secondary outcomes

Randomised controlled trials or controlled clinical trials

• adverse effects (for example bloating, ﬂatulence);
• patient satisfaction;
• health-related quality of life;
• total mortality;
• morbidity;
• costs.

Confounders

• Compliance.

Timing of outcome assessment

Trials had to have a minimum of six weeks of intervention period.

Electronic searches

The following electronic data bases were searched:

• The Cochrane Library (issue 2, 2006);
• MEDLINE (until May 2006);
• EMBASE (until May 2006);
• CINAHL (until May 2006);
• AMED (until May 2006).

’Current Controlled Trials’
The database of ongoing trials,
(www.controlled-trials.com - until May 2006) and the ’Science
Citation Index’ was searched (until October 2006), the latter to
identify relevant studies that cited the primarily retrieved studies.
No language restriction was applied for searching and study in-
clusion.
The described search strategy (see for a detailed search strategy
under Appendix 1) was used for MEDLINE. For use with the
other databases this strategy was slightly adapted.

Additional searches

Authors of relevant identiﬁed studies and other experts (authors of
reviews) were contacted in order to obtain additional references,
unpublished trials or ongoing trials.

Handsearches

The reference lists of all included studies and of review articles
were screened in order to identify possible studies of interest. The
handsearch of specialised journals was not done because the sen-
sitivity of the electronic data base search improved by omitting
study design limitations and all relevant journals were included in
the electronic data bases.

Cohort studies

• Incidence of major risk factors for type 2 diabetes, including

impaired glucose tolerance, insulin resistance and overweight.

Data collection and analysis

Confounders

• age;
• physical activity;
• family history of diabetes;
• body mass index.

Selection of studies

The title and abstract of each record of the search was indepen-
dently assessed by two authors (MGP, JJvB). Studies were rejected
if the article deﬁnitely did not meet the review’s inclusion criteria;
otherwise the full text of the study was obtained. Interrater agree-
ment for study selection was measured using the kappa statistic

(Cohen 1960). Differences between authors’ results were resolved
by discussion.
Duplicate publications were aimed to be identiﬁed by comparing
publications of the same authors with respect to study populations,
location, date and follow-up time of the study.

Data extraction and management

From original reports of the studies data were independently ex-
tracted by two authors. Differences in results were resolved by dis-
cussion and if necessary a third author was consulted.
From (randomised) controlled trials the following data were ex-
tracted:

• general information: published/unpublished, title, authors,

source, country, year of publication, funding, duplicate
publication;

• trial characteristics: design, duration, randomizations,
concealment of allocation, blinding, checking of blinding;

• intervention: length of intervention, dietary advice/diet

provided, comparison interventions;

• participants: population, exclusion criteria, number (total,
per compared groups), age, gender, health condition, diagnostic
criteria used to deﬁne health condition, similarity groups at
baseline, medication used, assessment of compliance,
withdrawals/losses to follow-up, confounders: body mass index,
physical activity, family history of diabetes;

• outcomes: outcomes speciﬁed above, main outcomes

assessed in the study;

• results: for outcomes and times of assessment (including a

measure of variation), intention-to-treat analyses.

The following data were extracted from cohort studies (adapted
data extraction form of the Cochrane Non-Randomised Studies
Methods Group).

• general information: published/unpublished, title, authors,

source, country, year of publication, duplicate publication;

• study characteristics: design, dates of enrolment, follow-up;
• exposure: type, type of measurement, validation of

measurement, time-points measurements;

• outcome: type, criteria used, type of measurement,

validation of measurement;

• participants: number identiﬁed, number excluded, number

lost to follow-up, characteristics;

(1) Minimisation of selection bias - a) was the randomisation pro-
cedure adequate? b) was the allocation concealment adequate?
(2) Minimisation of performance bias - were the participants and
people administering the treatment blind to the intervention?
(3) Minimisation of attrition bias - a) were withdrawals and drop-
outs completely described? was analysis by intention-to-treat?
(4) Minimisation of detection bias - were outcome assessors blind
to the intervention?
Ad 2) As the treatment was a dietary intervention in which blinding
participants and people administering the food is not possible,
these criteria were not rated.
Based on these criteria, studies were broadly subdivided into the
following three categories (Higgins 2005):
A - all quality criteria met: low risk of bias.
B - one or more of the quality criteria only partly met: moderate
risk of bias.
C - one or more criteria not met: high risk of bias.
This classiﬁcation was intended to be used as the basis of a sensi-
tivity analysis.

Cohort studies

The quality of cohort studies was assessed using the following
criteria (derived from Form III for the assessment of a cohort study,
version February 2003, www.cochrane.nl):
- number of appropriate confounders investigated and adjusted
for;
- same method of measurement of outcome in exposed and unex-
posed group;
- quality of method used to assess outcome measures: self report
without validation, self report with validation, direct measure-
ment/medical records;
- quality of method used to assess whole-grain intake: food fre-
quency questionnaire without validation, food frequency ques-
tionnaire with validation; single measurement, repeated measure-
ment;
- duration and completeness of follow-up.
Quality of studies was independently examined by two authors.
Differences in results were resolved by discussion and if necessary
a third author was consulted.

• results: total number cases, cases in group with lowest and

highest intake, results of outcome, confounders adjusted for.

Publication bias was to be assessed by preparation of a ’funnel plot’
and examined statistically for signs of asymmetry (Egger 1997).

Assessment of risk of bias in included studies

Randomised controlled trials or controlled clinical trials

The quality of reporting of each trial was assessed based largely on
the quality criteria speciﬁed by Schulz and by Jadad (Jadad 1996;
Schulz 1995). In particular, the following factors were studied:

Data were intended to be summarized statistically if they were
sufﬁciently similar, and of sufﬁcient quality.
For continuous outcomes, weighted mean differences were to be
used to analyse the size of the effects of the interventions. The

effect sizes for dichotomous data were to be expressed in terms of
relative risks, odds ratios or hazard ratios.
In RCTs intention-to-treat analysis was planned to be used when
the information was provided.
All data were to be initially analysed with a ﬁxed-effect model.
Heterogeneity between trial results were to be tested by using a
standard chi-squared test. To quantify inconsistency the I-squared
statistic was to be used (Higgins 2003) which describes the per-
centage of the variability in effect estimates that is due to het-
erogeneity rather than sampling error. A value greater than 50%
was to be considered substantial heterogeneity. Possible causes of
heterogeneity were to be explored by conducting subgroup and
sensitivity analyses. If signiﬁcant heterogeneity is found, it is un-
reasonable to assume that there is one ’true’ effect underlying the
data, that is constant across different populations and therefore a
random effects model was to be used.

• repeating the analysis excluding studies using the following

ﬁlters: diagnostic criteria, language of publication, source of
funding (industry versus other), country.

• repeating the analysis excluding studies about which no

primary consensus was reached.

The robustness of the results was also to be tested by repeating
the analysis using different measures of effect size (risk difference,
odds ratio etc.) and different statistical models (ﬁxed and random-
effects models).

R E S U L T S

Description of studies

Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity

When the amount of data permits, subgroup analyses were to be
conducted according to age, sex, duration of intervention, types of
whole grain foods and amounts of whole grain foods consumed,
since variations may be due to characteristics of dietary interven-
tion.

Sensitivity analysis

It was intended to perform sensitivity analyses in order to explore
the inﬂuence of the following factors on effect size:

• repeating the analysis excluding unpublished studies (if

there were any).

• repeating the analysis taking account of study quality, as

speciﬁed above.

• repeating the analysis excluding any very long or large

studies to establish how much they dominate the results.

Results of the search

With the MEDLINE search 3395 possibly eligible studies were
found. With the search in EMBASE 1560 additional studies were
identiﬁed. The search in CINAHL added another 586 studies,
the search in AMED four and the search in The Cochrane Library
259 more studies (total 5804 possibly eligible studies). With the
initial screening of the 5804 possibly eligible studies 22 studies
were identiﬁed and the full text of these studies was obtained.
After detailed examination 11 studies were excluded. No further
study was found searching the database of ongoing trials (Current
Controlled Trials - www.controlled-trials.com) and scanning the
reference lists of all so far included studies and of review articles. By
searching the Science Citation Index to identify relevant studies
that have cited the primarily retrieved studies one further study
was found (van Dam 2006). For an overview of study selection
please see Figure 1 showing details of the amended QUOROM
(quality of reporting of meta-analyses) statement.

Figure 1. QUOROM (quality of reporting of meta-analyses) ﬂow chart of study selection

Authors of the identiﬁed relevant studies and other experts (au-
thors of reviews) were contacted in order to obtain additional ref-
erences, unpublished trials, or ongoing trials. No additional study
was retrieved by this means. The possibility that certain publica-
tions were duplicates was examined by comparing publications of
the same authors with respect to study populations, location, date
and follow-up time of the study. No duplicate publications were
identiﬁed.

In total 12 studies were identiﬁed that met all the inclusion crite-
ria. One study was a randomised controlled trial and eleven were
cohort studies. Details of the randomised controlled trial are listed
in Appendix 2 and details of the prospective cohort studies are
shown in Appendix 3.
The following gives a brief overview:

Interrater agreement

Randomised controlled trial

The interrater agreement for study selection was measured using
the kappa statistic (Cohen 1960) and was 0.57 which indicates
moderate agreement. Differences between authors’ results were
resolved by discussion.

Design and duration

The trial of Pereira et al (Pereira 2002) had a cross-over design
with two six-week feeding periods and a washout period of six to
nine weeks.

Missing data

Two authors were contacted to retrieve additional information.

Participants

Included studies

Twelve overweight or obese (BMI 27 to 36 kg/m2) hyperinsuline-
mic adults aged 25 to 56 years (six women, six men) took part in
the trial.

Interventions

One diet contained products of reﬁned grains, thus products with
no bran or germ and little ﬁbre. In the other diet the reﬁned grain
products where substituted by whole grain products. All food of
the two different diets was prepared at the metabolic kitchen of the
research centre where the study was conducted. The participants
stayed there during the two feeding periods and were asked to
consume all of the food provided to them and to consume no
other food, except energy-free beverages.

Outcome measures

insulin resistance (homeostasis
Fasting insulin concentrations,
method) and insulin sensitivity (euglycemic hyperinsulinemic
clamp test) were determined.

Cohort studies

Design and duration

All 11 studies were prospective cohort studies. Four had a follow-
up duration of six years (Meyer 2000; Montonen 2003; Salmeron
1997a; Salmeron 1997b), three lasted eight years (Koh-Banerjee
2004; Schulze 2004; van Dam 2006), one nine years (Stevens
2002), one 10 years (Liu 2000) and two 12 years (Fung 2002;
Liu 2003). In all but one studies the results were reported in risks
across quintiles of whole-grain or cereal ﬁbre intake. Montonen et
al. (Montonen 2003) assessed the risk across quartiles.

Participants

All participants were without previous diagnosis of diabetes. In
six studies participants were only women (Liu 2000; Liu 2003;
Meyer 2000; Salmeron 1997a; Schulze 2004; van Dam 2006).
In three studies only men participated (Fung 2002; Koh-Banerjee
2004; Salmeron 1997b), in the other two studies participants were
men and women. Age at base line of inclusion was 21 to 75 years,
and the age range of the cohorts varied from 14 to 47 years. One
study compared the risk of whites with that of African-Ameri-
cans (Stevens 2002). In one study participants were only African-
American women (van Dam 2006). In the other studies ethnic-
ity was not mentioned. All studies were conducted in the United
States, with the exception of one, which was located in Finland
(Montonen 2003). In seven ( Liu 2000; Liu 2003; Fung 2002;
Koh-Banerjee 2004; Salmeron 1997a; Salmeron 1997b; Schulze
2004) of the eleven studies participants were health professionals.

grain intake (Fung 2002; Liu 2003; van Dam 2006) and two
studies both whole grain and cereal ﬁbre intake (Meyer 2000;
Montonen 2003). Two studies measured the change in whole grain
intake (Koh-Banerjee 2004; Liu 2003) and one of them also the
change in cereal ﬁbre intake (Koh-Banerjee 2004).
Whole grain food was deﬁned in most studies (Fung 2002; Liu
2000; Liu 2003; Meyer 2000) according to Jacobs et al (Jacobs
1998) and Liu et al (Liu 1999) and included dark bread, popcorn,
cooked oatmeal, wheat germ, brown rice, bran and other grains
(e.g. bulgar, kasha, couscous). Whole-grain breakfast cereals were
classiﬁed as whole grain as they contained more than 25% whole
grain or bran. Montonen et al (Montonen 2003) modiﬁed this
classiﬁcation and did not include wheat germ and bran. Reported
amounts of food were converted to grams per day in their study.
Koh-Banerjee et al (Koh-Banerjee 2004) used in addition to the
previous described classiﬁcation the deﬁnition issued by the FDA
for products eligible for a whole-grain health claim: foods that
contain more than 51% of whole grain (all portions of the kernel)
per reference amount customarily consumed (FDA 2005). Van
Dam et al (van Dam 2006) assessed the intake of whole grains
in form of “dark breads, such as wheat, rye, pumpernickel” and
“high ﬁbre, bran or granola cereals, shredded wheat”.

Outcome measures

Nine studies measured the incidence of type 2 diabetes (Fung
2002; Liu 2000; Meyer 2000; Montonen 2003; Salmeron 1997a;
Salmeron 1997b; Schulze 2004; Stevens 2002; van Dam 2006)
and two studies changes in weight gain (Koh-Banerjee 2004; Liu
2003). One study reported the incidence of obesity (BMI more
than 30 kg/m2) and severe weight gain (more than 25 kg) (Liu
2003). The effect sizes for dichotomous data were expressed in
terms of relative risks (RR) in most studies, odds ratios (OR) in
one study (Liu 2003) or hazard ratios (HR) (Stevens 2002; van
Dam 2006) in two studies. RRs and HRs reported are compar-
isons between the upper category of intake (highest quartile/quin-
tile) and the lowest category (lowest quartile/quintile). The meth-
ods used to determine RRs and HRs are listed in (see under Ap-
pendix 4. Qality assessment of cohort studies“ as well as the ini-
tial and adjusted effect sizes. In the publications no information
of goodness of ﬁt of the statistical models were given. In all but
two studies outcome was assessed with a biennial questionnaire
which was mailed to all participants. Stevens et al (Stevens 2002)
assessed incidence of diabetes every three years and Montonen et al
(Montonen 2003) gained information about new type 2 diabetes
cases needing drug therapy via a central register of all patients re-
ceiving drug reimbursement.
None of the studies reported insulin sensitivity or glucose intoler-
ance.

Exposure

Four studies assessed cereal ﬁbre intake (Salmeron 1997a;
Salmeron 1997b; Schulze 2004; Stevens 2002), three studies whole

The original purpose of most studies was to investigate how diet
and other lifestyle factors inﬂuence the development of various
diseases. The primary aim of the Black Women’s Health study
(van Dam 2006) was to identify risk factors for diseases with high
prevalence in black women. The ARIC study (Stevens 2002) was
designed to investigate the aetiology of atherosclerosis and varia-
tion in cardiovascular risk factors, medical care and disease by race,
gender, location and date.

Excluded studies

Eleven studies were excluded. The main reason of exclusion was
that the diet administered during the intervention did not fulﬁl the
inclusion criteria (for details see under Characteristics of excluded
studies).

Risk of bias in included studies

Randomised controlled trials

The included trial (Pereira 2002) was a six-week intervention study
in 12 persons with a cross-over design and a washout period of six
to nine weeks.

Minimisation of selection bias

In the publication the trial was described as randomised but no
information about the randomisation procedure was given. Also,
no attempt to allocation concealment was described.

Minimisation of attrition bias

Data of three persons (25%) could not be used for the outcome
insulin sensitivity. One person became ill during the wash-out
period and did not complete the study. In two persons the clamp
tests were not completed due to technical difﬁculties.

Minimisation of detection bias

According to the protocol blinding of participants and people
administering the food was not rated as this concerns a dietary
intervention in which blinding is not possible. Blinding of the
outcome assessor was not reported in the publication.
Based on these quality criteria there is a high risk of bias in this
trial (category C).

Cohort studies

Number of appropriate confounders investigated and

adjusted for

The number of confounders that were used to correct the results
varied considerably between the studies included (see under Ap-
pendix 4). Thirty six percent of the studies did not adjust for
confounders that should have been minimally considered, namely
BMI, physical activity and family history of diabetes. Three stud-
ies (Meyer 2000; Montonen 2003; Stevens 2002) did not correct
for family history of diabetes and one study did not account for
physical activity (Montonen 2003). Confounders were assessed
with a self-administered questionnaire. Five studies (Meyer 2000;
Montonen 2003; Salmeron 1997a; Salmeron 1997b; van Dam
2006) did not repeat the assessment done at baseline, three stud-
ies (Fung 2002; Koh-Banerjee 2004; Schulze 2004) repeated the
assessment every two years and one study (Liu 2003) once after
two years and twice after four years. From two publications (Liu
2000; Stevens 2002) it became not clear whether assessment of
confounders was repeated.

Same method of measurement of outcome in exposed and

unexposed group

In all studies in all participants the same method of outcome mea-
surement was used regardless of the level of whole grain or cereal
ﬁbre intake.

Quality of method used to assess outcome measures: self
report without validation, self report with validation, direct

measurement/medical records

In nine studies the outcome was self-reported. In one study it was
directly measured (serum glucose concentrations) (Stevens 2002)
and in one study (Montonen 2003) a central register of patients
receiving drug reimbursement was used. All studies using self-re-
ported diagnosis of type 2 diabetes validated the outcome in sub-
groups by comparing it with medical records. Studies with weight
gain as an outcome measure validated the self-reported weight in
subgroups by measuring weight directly (Koh-Banerjee 2004; Liu
2003). The validation studies showed over all a high agreement
between self report and control assessment (see Appendix 4). The
number of participants in the validation studies lay between 59
and 184. No information was given on what ground the subgroup
size was chosen.

Quality of method used to assess whole-grain intake

Dietary intake over the previous year was assessed with mailed
semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaires (FFQ) in nine
studies, in one study (Stevens 2002) it was interviewer adminis-
tered and in one study (Montonen 2003) a dietary history inter-
view was taken. The FFQ mostly assessed the intake of 100 to
134 items, two studies assessed intake of less than 100 items (68
items (van Dam 2006); 66 items (Stevens 2002)). Dietary assess-
ment was repeated one to three times in ﬁve studies (Fung 2002;
Koh-Banerjee 2004; Liu 2000; Liu 2003; Schulze 2004); the other

studies did not repeat the assessment. In all studies results of the
dietary assessment were validated against results of detailed diet
records in subgroups. In two studies (Schulze 2004; Stevens 2002)
an FFQ was used that was not validated in a subgroup of the same
population. Examples of relevant correlation coefﬁcients are listed
in Appendix 4’ and showed variable agreement. The number of
participants in the validation studies lay between 44 and 1844.
No information was given on what ground the subgroup size was
chosen.

Duration and completeness of follow-up

The duration of the studies lay between six and twelve years and
was considered to be long enough. Loss to follow-up (from sample
to study population) was only described in one study. Stevens et al
(Stevens 2002) reported an initial response rate of 67% in whites
and of 42% in African-American. Four studies reported response
rates to the repeated assessments of outcome. More than 80%
responded to biennial questionnaires send to the study population
in the study of van Dam et al (van Dam 2006) and 94% in that of
Fung et al. (Fung 2002). The response rate to the questionnaires
in the study of Meyer et al (Meyer 2000) declined during the study
period (91%, 86%, 79%). Stevens et al (Stevens 2002) reported
that a total of approximately 80% of the study population that
remained alive at the end of the study period was examined at all
four visits.

assessed in statistical models and not found to be signiﬁcant. In
all the ﬁnal models the main effect of period was included.

Secondary outcome measures

Adverse effects

Gastrointestinal symptoms recorded (heartburn, indigestion, di-
arrhoea, loose stools) were not signiﬁcantly different between di-
ets. Frequency of bowel movements signiﬁcantly increased with
the whole-grain diet (2 ± 0.2 versus 1 ± 0.2 movements/d; P <
0.001).

Patient satisfaction

Patient satisfaction was not included as an outcome.

Health-related quality of life

Health-related quality of life was not included as an outcome.

Total mortality

Total mortality was not included as an outcome.

Interrater agreement

The interrater agreement for study quality was measured using the
kappa statistic (Cohen 1960) and was 0.88. Differences between
authors’ results were resolved by discussion.

Morbidity

Morbidity was not included as an outcome.

Effects of interventions

Costs

Primary outcome measures

Results of insulin sensitivity measurements of both intervention
periods were retrieved from the author (Pereira 2002) as only the
mean difference was given in the publication. Insulin sensitivity
(M-value) was measured with the euglycemic hyperinsulinemic
clamp test and was signiﬁcantly higher after the feeding period
with whole grain (0.396 x 10−4 ± 0.131 x 10−4 mmol . kg−1. min
−1 per pmol/L) than after that with reﬁned grain (0.323 x 10−4 ±
0.043 x 10−4 mol . kg−1. min −1 per pmol/L) (mean difference:
0.07 x 10−4 mmol . kg −1. min−1 per pmol/L, 95% CI 0.003 x 10
−4 to 0.144 x 10−4; P < 0.05). To examine violation of the cross-
over design assumption, the period by treatment interaction was

Compliance was controlled by comparing the energy content of
supplied food not eaten and food that was extra eaten (not sup-
plied).
The energy content of food not eaten during the intervention
periods did not differ signiﬁcantly between the whole-grain (159
± 75 kJ/d) and the reﬁned-grain (222 ± 126 kJ/d) diets. Also, the
energy content of extra food intake was not different (46 ± 25 kJ/
d whole-grain diet; 63 ± 33 kJ/d reﬁned-grain diet).

Cohort studies

Data of studies were not pooled because of methodological diver-
sity (measures of effect size, statistical analyses used, number of
collected confounders).

Whole grain intake and incidence of type 2 diabetes

D I S C U S S I O N

Intake of whole grain was inversely associated with risk of type
2 diabetes in all ﬁve studies (comparison 01.01) which, however,
was not statistically signiﬁcant in one study (Montonen 2003).
The discrepancy of this result with that of the other studies could
be caused by the relatively low number of participants (4.316) in
this study compared to mostly far more than 10.000 participants
in the other studies, which is also reﬂected by the width of the
conﬁdential interval (0.67, 95% conﬁdence interval (CI) 0.32 to
1.38).
The relative risks (RR) varied between 0.67 (95% CI 0.32 to 1.38)
and 0.79 (95% CI 0.65 to 0.96). After exclusion of studies that did
not correct for family history of diabetes (Meyer 2000; Montonen
2003) and physical activity (Montonen 2003), the observed effect
was very similar in the rest of the studies (RR of 0.70, 0.73 and
0.73).

Cereal ﬁbre intake and incidence of type 2 diabetes

Intake of cereal ﬁbre was inversely associated with type 2 diabetes
in all six studies (comparison 01.02). The RR varied between 0.37
(95% CI 0.20 to 0.77) and 0.79 (95% CI 0.67 to 0.93). Exclusion
of studies that did not correct for family history of diabetes (
Meyer 2000; Montonen 2003; Stevens 2002) and physical activity
(Montonen 2003) narrowed the range of the effect; the RR lay
between 0.63 and 0.72.
Stevens et al (Stevens 2002) also compared the hazard ratios of
diabetes in two subpopulations: cereal ﬁbre intake was inversely
associated with risk of diabetes in whites and African-Americans
(0.86,95% CI 0.65 to 1.15) but statistically different only in whites
(0.75, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.92).

Change in whole grain intake and change in weight gain

The results of the studies investigating the association between
change in whole grain or cereal ﬁbre intake and change in weight
gain are shown in Appendix 5. Over a time period of eight years
weight gain was reduced by 0.5 kg or 0.3 kg in the groups that
increased whole grain intake the most (dependent on the deﬁnition
of whole grain) in one study in men (Koh-Banerjee 2004) and by
0.4 kg over a period of 12 years in another study in women (Liu
2003). Similar results were observed when change in cereal ﬁbre
intake was considered (0.4 kg less weight gain in eight years) (Koh-
Banerjee 2004). The odds of developing obesity (0.81, 95%CI
0.73 to 0.91) or having a major weight gain (0.77, 95% CI 0.59
to 1.01) tended to be lower with increased intake of whole grain
foods, as reported in the study of Liu et al (Liu 2003).

Assessment of publication bias

Publication bias was not assessed as it was considered to be not
useful due to the low number of studies (Lau 2006).

Summary of main results

This review identiﬁed 12 studies examining the relation between
whole grain intake and the development of type 2 diabetes. Only
one study was a randomised controlled trial, the other 11 prospec-
tive cohort studies. The RCT had a cross-over design and showed
slight improvement of insulin sensitivity in obese hyperinsuli-
naemic participants after the whole grain intervention of six weeks.
However, the risk of bias in this study is considered to be high
since allocation concealment was not stated and the randomisa-
tion procedure was not described. The trial was of short duration
(minimum time period needed for inclusion) with a small sample
size. Whether the small elevation of the insulin sensitivity has any
clinical relevance is doubtful. However, from a theoretical perspec-
tive it could add to the delay of the onset of type 2 diabetes.
The results of the cohort studies were homogenous. None of the
studies showed the opposite effect; in one study the effect was not
signiﬁcant. Signiﬁcantly decreased risk of development of type 2
diabetes was associated in four cohort studies with high whole grain
intake (range: 21% to 30%) and in six studies with high cereal
ﬁbre intake, (range: 21% to 63%) which can be considered to be a
marker of whole grain consumption. Two studies investigated the
effect of whole grain consumption on overweight, an important
risk factor for type 2 diabetes. Increased whole grain consumption
was associated with only a very slight reduction (0.3 to 0.5 kg)
in weight gain and a reduced risk of becoming obese during the
follow-up period. The slight reductions in weight gain can not
be regarded as clinical relevant considering the long time periods
(eight and twelve years) in which they were observed.
The methodological quality varied between studies mainly with
regard to the food intake assessment and the numbers of con-
founders considered. Food intake was in most studies assessed with
food frequency questionnaires. One limitation of this approach is
the small number of food items listed (66 to 134 items) which re-
stricts extensive assessment of the food products of interest. None
of the food frequency questionnaires was designed especially for
assessment of whole grain foods. Measurement error of food intake
due to inter-individual variation during the course of the years can
be reduced by repeated collection of dietary information. Only
ﬁve studies repeated the measurement to obtain a better reﬂec-
tion of the long-term intake. Measurement errors in dietary intake
may thus have limited the ability to obtain accurate risk estimates.
Residual confounding is a problem in prospective cohort studies.
As observed in these studies, higher intake of whole grain food
tends to be associated with healthier lifestyle and incomplete ad-
justment of lifestyle factors may result in an overestimation of the
effect.

Potential biases in the review process

The main limitation of this review is that evidence of a possible
protective effect of a diet rich in whole grain foods on the de-
velopment of type 2 diabetes is retrieved only from prospective
cohort studies of which some were of limited quality. As prospec-
tive cohort studies are more prone to bias and confounding than
randomised controlled trials results have to be interpreted with
caution.

Generalisability and applicability of results

All but one study were conducted in the United States. Most
American studies were done in health care workers but the results
of three different populations (Iowa women Health study (Meyer
2000), Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study (Stevens 2002)
and U.S. black women study (van Dam 2006)) were comparable as
were those of the study conducted in Finland (Montonen 2003).
As the majority of studies was conducted in only one part of the
world generalisability of results is uncertain.

A U T H O R S ’ C O N C L U S I O N S

Implications for practice

The evidence from the prospective cohort trials is considered to
be too weak to be able to draw a deﬁnite conclusion about the

preventive effect of whole grain foods on the development of type
2 diabetes.

Implications for research

Properly designed long-term randomised controlled trials are
needed to establish whether whole grain foods are protective for
the development of type 2 diabetes. To facilitate this, further mech-
anistic research should focus on ﬁnding a set of relevant inter-
mediate endpoints for type 2 diabetes and on identifying genetic
subgroups of the population at risk that are most susceptible to
dietary intervention.

Abstract Aims: Low glycaemic index (GI) diets are beneﬁcial in the management of hypergly-
cemia. Cardiovascular diseases are the major cause of mortality in diabetes therefore it is
important to understand the effects of GI on blood lipids. The aim was to systematically review
randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of low GI diets on blood lipids.
Data synthesis: We searched OVID Medline, Embase and Cochrane library to March 2012.
Random effects meta-analyses were performed on twenty-eight RCTs comparing low- with high
GI diets over at least 4 weeks (1272 participants; studies ranged from 6 to 155 participants);
one was powered on blood lipids, 3 had adequate allocation concealment. Low GI diets
signiﬁcantly reduced total ( 0.13 mmol/l, 95%CI  0.22 to  0.04, P Z 0.004, 27 trials, 1441
participants, I2 Z 0%) and LDL-cholesterol ( 0.16 mmol/l, 95%CI  0.24 to  0.08,
P < 0.0001, 23 trials, 1281 participants, I2 Z 0%) compared with high GI diets and
independently of weight loss. Subgroup analyses suggest that reductions in LDL-C are greatest
in studies of shortest duration and greatest magnitude of GI reduction. Furthermore, lipid
improvements appear greatest and most reliable when the low GI intervention is accompanied
by an increase in dietary ﬁbre. Sensitivity analyses, removing studies without adequate
allocation concealment, lost statistical signiﬁcance but retained suggested mean falls of

Introduction

The glycaemic index (GI) is a classiﬁcation of carbohydrate-
containing foods according to the glycaemic response that
they evoke [1]. The relevance of GI to both the prevention
and management of diabetes has received much attention;
compared to high GI carbohydrates, gram-for-gram, low GI
foods stimulate less insulin secretion and reduced incretin
levels [2], furthermore they have been shown to limit
reductions in insulin sensitivity [3e5]. Epidemiological
evidence supports a positive relationship between GI and
risk of type 2 diabetes [6] whilst the clinical utility of low GI
diets in the management of type 2 diabetes has been
demonstrated by two systematic reviews demonstrating
a 5% reduction in HbA1c [7,8].

Mortality rates from cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are
up to ﬁve times higher for patients with diabetes than the
non-diabetic population [9] in part due to the atherogenic
lipid proﬁle and hypertension which develops [10]. An
inverse relationship between GI and HDL-cholesterol (HDL-
C) has been found in two large cross-sectional studies
[11,12]. Further epidemiological evidence suggests that
there is a positive association between GI and triglycerides
[13] but evidence for the effect of GI on total and low-
density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is less clear [11,14].
The Cochrane meta-analysis which focused on people
with, or at high risk of, CVD found small signiﬁcant reduc-
tions in total and LDL-C with low GI diets but no effect on
HDL-C or triglycerides however the authors concluded that
further ‘well designed, adequately powered, randomised
controlled studies’ were needed [15]. Since the completion
of the Cochrane review there have been a number of larger
studies published which may help to elucidate the effects
of low GI diets on blood lipids.

We performed a systematic review with the aim to
assess the effects of low GI diets on blood lipids. In contrast
to the Cochrane review, our review includes healthy
participants as well as those who have CVD. We aimed to
explore the relationship between GI and blood lipids by
performing
dos-
eeresponse effects, study duration and study participant
effects, including whether effect size relates to baseline
lipid levels. Furthermore we explored the impact of
nutrient changes alongside GI changes on lipid outcomes.

Methods

Study identiﬁcation and selection

The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials
(CENTRAL), MEDLINE (1948 to March 2012) and EMBASE
(1980 to March 2012) were searched using text and indexing

terms. When possible, the systematic review and meta-
analyses were undertaken in line with the relevant criteria
of the PRISMA statement (Supplementary Information Fig. 1
Search strategies). The inclusion and exclusion criteria
were developed prior to searching using a PICOS structure
(Patient,
Intervention, Comparators, Outcome, Study
design) and were modelled on those of Kelly et al. [15].
Included studies had to be RCTs (crossover or parallel),
include non-pregnant and non-institutionalised adults with
any baseline lipid levels, compare a low GI diet (with
a signiﬁcant decrease in GI between baseline and the end of
the intervention) with a high GI diet (with a signiﬁcantly
higher GI) for at least 4 weeks. Studies were included if at
least one meal per day was substituted within the inter-
vention period, the paper was reported in English, and at
least one serum lipid outcome (total, LDL, HDL cholesterol
or triglycerides) was reported. Studies were excluded if
they clearly stated that macronutrient differences were
intended between the low and high GI
interventions,
although dietary ﬁbre differences were included. The
intervention and control diets had to be assessed during the
study via interaction with a health care worker, and were
excluded if no explicit information regarding assessment of
compliance was given. Participants who were acutely ill
e.g. chronic renal failure, cancer, HIV-positive or AIDS,
were excluded.

Located titles, abstracts and full texts were screened by
one researcher (DEC) and rejected where they did not
meet all the inclusion criteria. A second researcher (LMG)
reviewed the eligibility of full text articles against the
inclusion criteria.

Data extraction and quality assessment

Data extraction was conducted by a single reviewer (DEC)
onto a data extraction sheet modelled on Kelly et al., 2008
[15] and included: reference details; trial design charac-
teristics; details of intervention and comparator; duration;
method of calculating the GI; participant characteristics;
baseline and endpoint plasma lipid concentrations. Lipid
measurements were converted to mmol/L, and variance
data to standard deviations. For GI values, those which
were expressed against a bread reference were trans-
formed to the glucose scale using a factor of *0.71. Where
the GI scale was not explicitly stated authors were con-
tacted for clariﬁcation (n Z 5). A second researcher (LMG)
checked and validated the data extraction. Authors were
contacted (n Z 8) where there were insufﬁcient or missing
data.

Two independent researchers (DEC, LMG) assessed the
risk of bias using the criteria speciﬁed by Jadad [16] and
Schulz [17]; validity characteristics assessed included ran-
domisation method, allocation concealment, blinding of

Data synthesis

for

Meta-analysis was performed using Review Managerä
(version 5.1; Nordic Cochrane Centre, Oxford, England) to
determine the effects of low GI dietary interventions on
lipid concentrations. The generic inverse variance (IV)
method was used. The treatment effect of each trial was
the mean difference between post-
estimated as
intervention measurements
the intervention and
control arms (calculated as data for participants ingesting
low GI e data for those ingesting high GI). The point esti-
mate of mean difference for a crossover paired analysis is
the same as for a parallel-group analysis (the mean of the
differences is equal to the difference in means). I2 was used
to assess between study heterogeneity [18] and funnel plots
to assess small study bias. A random effects model was used
to calculate mean differences (MDs), 95% conﬁdence
intervals (CI) for each comparison, a combined overall
effect with p-value, and the p-value for testing heteroge-
neity. Sensitivity analyses were performed on studies of
high validity, assessed as low risk of bias relating to ran-
domisation, allocation concealment and reporting; blinding
bias was not included in the validity assessment as it is
often not feasible to blind dietary interventions.

Subgroup analyses were performed to investigate
possible factors that might relate to the effects across
included trials:
 Dose-response: on the basis of the scale of absolute
difference in GI between the intervention and control
groups (up to 10% points, 10.1e20% points and over 20%
points)
 Study duration: on the basis of tertiles of study duration
(0e8wks, 9e20wks and >20wks)
 Study participants: according to whether the study
involved participants with or without diabetes
Baseline lipid status: according to whether the partic-
ipants had optimal or sub-optimal lipid status at baseline
(using the NCEP III guidelines [19]).
 Effects of dietary ﬁbre: according to whether the low GI
intervention included a statistically signiﬁcant change
(increase) in dietary ﬁbre compared to the high GI arm.
 Effects of saturated fat changes: analyses were per-
formed to assess whether saturated fat is reduced in
low GI diets.

Results

Twenty-eight studies, 18 of parallel-group (total partic-
ipants, n Z 1073) [21e38] and 10 of crossover design (total
participants, n Z 199) [39e48], were included in the
analysis; details of the studies and participants are seen in
Supplementary Information Table 1.

Twenty-two studies compared a low GI diet with a high
GI diet, six studies compared a low GI diet with a ‘normal’
or ‘healthy eating’ diet (including a high-cereal ﬁbre diet
[27] and a conventional carbohydrate exchange diet [35])
of signiﬁcantly higher GI.

The validity of the included studies was variable and
often difﬁcult to assess due to studies providing insufﬁcient
information to assess
(Supplementary
Information Table 2). Thirteen studies reported what the
study was powered towards, only one [24] was powered
towards a change in blood lipids.

Lipid outcomes

Random effects meta-analysis of
the 27 trials (1441
participants) revealed that low GI diets signiﬁcantly reduce
total cholesterol by  0.13 mmol/l (95%CI  0.22 to  0.04,
p Z 0.004), with non-signiﬁcant heterogeneity (I2 Z 0%)
and LDL-C by  0.16 mmol/l (95%CI  0.24 to  0.08,
p < 0.0001, 23 trials, 1281 participants, I2 Z 0%) compared
with high GI diets (Figs. 1 and 2). The 24 included studies
(1331 participants) that reported HDL-C concentrations did
not suggest any effect of GI on HDL-C (MD -0.03 mmol/l,
95%CI -0.06 to 0.00, p Z 0.06, I2 Z 0%) (Supplementary
Information Fig. 3). Similarly, there were no clear effects
of GI on triglycerides (MD 0.01 mmol/l, 95%CI  0.06 to 0.08,
p Z 0.69,
I2 Z 0%, 27 RCTs, 1412 participants)
(Supplementary Information Fig. 4).

To investigate the impact of GI on lipid levels indepen-
dently of weight loss we performed post-hoc analyses
removing the nine studies with the stated objective of
weight loss. The resultant reductions in total cholesterol
( 0.15 mmol/l, 95%CI  0.25 to  0.04, p Z 0.005) and LDL-
C ( 0.18 mmol/l (95%CI  0.27 to  0.09, p < 0.001)
remained signiﬁcant.

Dose-response analysis

The LDL-C effect in studies with a greater difference in GI
between the intervention and control groups appeared
larger and more reliable (MD  0.21, 95%CI  0.33,  0.09,
p Z 0.0005) than in those with smaller GI differences
(MD  0.10, 95%CI  0.21, 0.01, p Z 0.08) but was not

Dietary ﬁbre analysis

In 13 studies, the low GI intervention was accompanied by
signiﬁcant increases in dietary ﬁbre and signiﬁcantly higher
endpoint ﬁbre intakes compared to the high GI intervention

were no signiﬁcant changes in dietary ﬁbre in the remaining
15 studies. Subgroup analysis based on whether there was
an increase in dietary ﬁbre showed that total cholesterol
and LDL-C reduced signiﬁcantly only when the low GI

lower saturated fat in the low GI arms (MD  0.55%, 95%CI
 1.02 to  0.08, p Z 0.02, I2 Z 28%) (Supplementary
Information Fig. 11). A sensitivity analysis, removing all
studies which reported a signiﬁcantly lower saturated fat
intake or which did not report saturated fat continued to
identify signiﬁcant effects of low GI interventions on total
cholesterol (MD  0.20 mmol/l 95%CI  0.33 to  0.07,
p Z 0.0003, n Z 640) and LDL-C (MD  0.21 mmol/l, 95%CI
 0.31 to  0.10, p Z 0.0001, n Z 552).

There was no clear evidence of small trial effects in funnel
plots of total and LDL-C data, but as there were no very large
studies the funnel plot was underpowered to detect any such
effects (Supplementary Information Fig. 12). Analyses
separating parallel (n Z 18) and crossover (n Z 10) studies
revealed signiﬁcant lipid lowering effects in both groups
(total cholesterol: parallel MD  0.11 mmol/l, 95%CI  0.22,
 0.00, p Z 0.04, I2 Z 0%; crossover MD  0.16 mmol/l, 95%CI
 0.31,  0.01, p Z 0.04, I2 Z 0%. LDL-C: parallel MD
 0.11 mmol/l, 95%CI  0.21,  0.01, p Z 0.02, I2 Z 0%;
crossover MD  0.24 mmol/l, 95%CI  0.36,  0.11,
p Z 0.0002, I2 Z 0%). Sensitivity analyses, removing studies

of moderate or low validity, leaving only three RCTs
[27,31,36] resulted in loss of the signiﬁcant effects of low GI
diets on total cholesterol while retaining similar point-
estimate mean differences (MD  0.09 mmol/l, 95%CI  0.25
to 0.07, p Z 0.28, 3 RCTs, 375 participants, I2 Z 0%) and LDL-
C (MD  0.11 mmol/l, 95%CI  0.25 to 0.03, p Z 0.12, 3 RCTs,
365 participants, I2 Z 0%). The majority of studies were
removed from the sensitivity analyses due to a lack of
information regarding selection bias (both randomisation
procedures and allocation concealment.

Discussion

We found 28 RCTs that assessed the effects of a low GI diet
on serum lipids. These trials provided consistent evidence
that a low GI diet reduced total ( 0.13 mmol/L, 95%
CI  0.22 to  0.04) and LDL-C ( 0.16 mmol/L, 95%CI  0.24
to  0.08), furthermore these lipid lowering effects appear
to occur independently of weight loss.

Subgroup analysis aimed at further exploring the relation-
ship between GI and serum lipids recognised that LDL-C
reductions were more consistent in studies in which the GI
reduction was of greatest magnitude, ideally at least 20 points
lower than control. Study duration also appeared to be an
important determinant of total and LDL-C changes with

8

L.M. Goff et al.

studies of 20 weeks or less bringing about more consistent
reductions than studies of longer duration which may suggest
there is an adaptive response occurring or issues relating to
participant compliance in longer studies. Additionally, lipid
changes were more consistent in people without diabetes,
perhaps because individuals with diabetes are more likely to
be receiving pharmaceutical therapy for hyperlipidaemia and
therefore are resistant to any further changes. We investi-
gated the impact of dietary changes, other than GI, on lipid
changes and have shown that low GI diets, which are accom-
panied by increases in dietary ﬁbre, are more effective at
reducing total and LDL-C than low GI interventions alone.

Sensitivity analysis, removing studies of lower validity,
suggested a loss of the signiﬁcant effects of low GI dietary
interventions on total and LDL-C. Larger studies and studies
with high validity (for example robust
randomisation
methods, concealed allocation, blinding) are needed to
conﬁrm the ﬁndings of effects on total and LDL-C. The
sensitivity analyses emphasize the need to publish full
methodological details regarding randomisation and alloca-
tion concealment as the majority of studies were deemed
‘unclear’ for these sources of bias.

We acknowledge the limitations of our review. We inten-
ded to investigate whether the magnitude of lipid changes
were related to baseline lipid concentrations however
baseline lipid concentrations were too narrow to assess such
an effect. Furthermore, it should be considered that only one
of the studies included in our review was powered on serum
lipids; the majority of studies were powered on an index of
insulin action or glycaemia. The risk of publication bias
should also be considered; as the majority of the studies were
not primarily focused on lipids there is a risk that these
outcomes were only reported when there were ‘positive’
ﬁndings. We have only reviewed manuscripts published in
English and acknowledge the possibility of selection bias.
Furthermore, whilst we were guided, wherever possible, by
the recommendations of the Cochrane library for under-
taking a systematic review, it was not feasible for us to
adhere strictly to these recommendations at all stages.

It is important to consider whether dietary alterations
other than to GI could have contributed to the signiﬁcant
reductions in total and LDL-C as dietary intervention studies
focused on manipulating single dietary components are
inherently difﬁcult to perform. Our meta-analyses are the
ﬁrst to investigate the impact of weight loss, saturated fat
and dietary ﬁbre changes alongside low GI interventions on
lipid outcomes thus helping to recognise aspects of study
design which impact on lipid changes and may explain some
of the variability in the published outcomes. Unfortunately
only a small number of studies published full dietary
information, including saturated fat, and therefore some of
our analyses may not be conclusive. Further investigation of
all types of fat intakes for the studies in this review is
warranted in order to better understand the impact of
saturated and unsaturated fats. Our review is limited to
investigating GI effects however glycaemic load (GL) is
another important consideration, which captures the effect
of carbohydrate quantity as well as quality and may be
more effective at altering blood triglycerides [49].

The variation in the average GI of both the low and the
high GI groups between the studies is remarkable (21e57
for the low GI diets, and 51 to 75 for the high GI diets,

indexed to glucose) and makes it difﬁcult to translate the
ﬁndings of this review in to a health promotion message as
an optimal GI is unclear. A further issue when comparing
these studies is the varying scale upon which the GI has
been calculated and expressed; although there is expert
agreement that GI should be measured in relation to
a glucose standard [50], older studies often used a bread
standard and a number of studies did not publish the
reference standard. In the present review clariﬁcation was
sought from authors and the data have been transformed to
the glucose scale, thus allowing for a robust comparison.

Large cross-sectional studies have suggested that low GI
diets are associated with higher HDL-C [11,12] and lower
fasting triglyceride concentrations [13] however the results
of our meta-analysis and others [15] do not support this
epidemiological evidence. There is often a divergence
between epidemiological and clinical trial ﬁndings; the
former being limited by confounding effects and the later
often underpowered to detect signiﬁcant changes. Our
meta-analysis supports the prospective epidemiological
ﬁndings of Liu et al. (2000) who found dietary GI (and load)
are signiﬁcantly associated with CHD risk [51], and is in
complete agreement with the Cochrane meta-analysis which
reports a total and LDL-C lowering effect of low GI diets [15].
Our analyses have shown importantly that low GI inter-
ventions are more effective at lowering serum lipids when
there is a concurrent increase in dietary ﬁbre intake, sug-
gesting that GI and ﬁbre are working in combination to affect
lipid absorption or synthesis. The effects of high ﬁbre diets
on lipid concentrations have been previously investigated;
cereal sources, rich in insoluble ﬁbre, appear to have little
effect on serum lipids [27,52] but soluble ﬁbre sources are
effective at lowering lipids [53]. The mechanisms by which
low GI diets reduce total cholesterol and LDL-C are not fully
understood; it may be that low GI interventions lead to
increased intakes of soluble ﬁbre which cannot be assessed
in the current review. It has been proposed that increased
dietary ﬁbre will bring about reductions in bile acid and
cholesterol reabsorption from the ileum, which may inhibit
hepatic cholesterol synthesis [54]. A further theory is that
low GI diets have their effects through reducing insulin
secretion thus reducing insulin-stimulated activity of 5-
hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase, the rate-limiting
enzyme involved in cholesterol synthesis [54].

While the reductions in total cholesterol and LDL-C are
only small and do not compare to the reductions that are
brought about by pharmacological therapies, they are
comparable with other dietary interventions which have
been used to reduce cardiovascular risk. In the Cochrane
review [55] of dietary advice for reducing cardiovascular
risk, Brunner et al. (2007) found total cholesterol reduced
by 0.16 mmol/L and LDL-C by 0.18 mmol/L using a variety
of dietary interventions including fat quantity and type,
and increased fruit and vegetable consumption.

Diabetes management guidelines have recognised for
some time the potential beneﬁts of low GI carbohydrates for
the management of blood glucose levels [56,57]. Patients
with type 2 diabetes are usually also characterised by dysli-
pidemia, often present at diagnosis, and reduction of LDL-C
and triglycerides is a management priority in order to
reduce cardiovascular risk [58]. The results of our review
provide evidence that the promotion of low GI carbohydrates

Glycaemic index and blood lipids: A meta-analysis

will bring about beneﬁcial reductions in serum total and LDL-
C in addition to the beneﬁts to glycaemic control [8].

In conclusion, the results of our meta-analysis of low GI
diets on blood lipids show that there is consistent evidence
that low GI diets signiﬁcantly reduce total and LDL-C without
affecting HDL-C or triglycerides; this ﬁnding supports
previous systematic reviews. However, our analyses did not
demonstrate a lowering of triglycerides or an increase in
HDL-C by the low GI studies which is at odds with epidemio-
logical ﬁndings. Our sub-analysis recognised the important
role of increasing dietary ﬁbre alongside reduced GI in
effectively lowering serum lipids. Other components of study
design, such as duration and magnitude of change, may be
responsible for the variability seen in the effects of low GI
interventions on serum lipid changes. Overall we found that
the strength of the evidence is moderate and sufﬁciently
powered investigations are needed. Further investigations
are warranted to understand the mechanisms by which low GI
diets alter blood lipids, and whether such an effect is
secondary to changes in other dietary components, for
example ﬁbre, saturated or unsaturated fat.

ABSTRACT
Background: The relation between sugar-sweetened beverages
(SSBs) and body weight remains controversial.
Objective: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to
summarize the evidence in children and adults.
Design: We searched PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases
through March 2013 for prospective cohort studies and randomized
controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated the SSB-weight relation.
Separate meta-analyses were conducted in children and adults and
for cohorts and RCTs by using random- and ﬁxed-effects models.
Results: Thirty-two original articles were included in our meta-analy-
ses: 20 in children (15 cohort studies, n = 25,745; 5 trials, n = 2772) and
12 in adults (7 cohort studies, n = 174,252; 5 trials, n = 292). In cohort
studies, one daily serving increment of SSBs was associated with a 0.06
(95% CI: 0.02, 0.10) and 0.05 (95% CI: 0.03, 0.07)-unit increase in
BMI in children and 0.22 kg (95% CI: 0.09, 0.34 kg) and 0.12 kg (95%
CI: 0.10, 0.14 kg) weight gain in adults over 1 y in random- and ﬁxed-
effects models, respectively. RCTs in children showed reductions in
BMI gain when SSBs were reduced [random and ﬁxed effects:
20.17 (95% CI: 20.39, 0.05) and 20.12 (95% CI: 20.22, 20.2)],
whereas RCTs in adults showed increases in body weight when SSBs
were added (random and ﬁxed effects: 0.85 kg; 95% CI: 0.50, 1.20 kg).
Sensitivity analyses of RCTs in children showed more pronounced
beneﬁts in preventing weight gain in SSB substitution trials (compared
with school-based educational programs) and among overweight chil-
dren (compared with normal-weight children).
Conclusion: Our systematic review and meta-analysis of prospec-
tive cohort studies and RCTs provides evidence that SSB consump-

INTRODUCTION

As the search for solutions to the worldwide epidemic of obesity
continues, the relation between consumption of sugar-sweetened
beverages (SSBs)4 and body weight has become a matter of much
public and scientiﬁc interest. SSBs are composed of energy-con-
taining sweeteners such as sucrose (50% glucose, 50% fructose),
high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS; most often 45% glucose and
55% fructose), or fruit juice concentrates that are added to the
beverage by manufacturers, establishments, or individuals and
usually contain .25 kcal per 8 ﬂuid ounces. Although temporal
patterns from the United States have shown a decrease in added
sugar consumption between 2000 and 2008, primarily from re-
ductions in SSBs, average intakes still exceed recommended limits
and SSBs continue to be the largest contributor to added sugar and

top sources of calories in the US diet (1). Globally, intake of SSBs
has been increasing steadily, because of rapid urbanization and
heavy marketing in low- and middle-income countries (2).

Within the past 2 decades, a number of epidemiologic studies
both in children and adults have evaluated the association between
SSB intake and weight gain and obesity. In general, ﬁndings from
large observational studies support a link between SSB con-
sumption and development of obesity (3, 4). However, controversy
remains whether the association is causal and whether public action
should be taken on the basis of the observational evidence. Re-
cently, several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have been
performed to evaluate whether adding SSBs into the habitual diet
can increase body weight or if substituting SSBs by other low- or
noncaloric beverages can reduce weight gain or facilitate weight
loss. The results have been mixed as a result of heterogeneity in
study design, sample size, and study duration.

For clinicians and policymakers to make informed evidence-
based recommendations about SSBs, the totality of the available
evidence needs to be examined in a thorough and systematic
manner. Thus, we conducted a systematic review and meta-
analyses of prospective cohort studies and RCTs in children and
adults to provide a comprehensive summary of the literature
evaluating SSBs and body weight gain.

METHODS

SSBs AND WEIGHT GAIN

1085

PubMed (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed; since 1966),
EMBASE (http://www.embase.com;
since 1947), and the
Cochrane library (http://www.thecochranelibrary.com/; since
1951) databases from the index date through March 2013 for
studies evaluating the association between SSBs and body weight
in children and adults. Our search strategy combined various
terms for SSBs (eg, carbonated beverages, sweetened beverages,
soda, sports drink, fruit drink) and body weight (ie, body weight,
BMI, overweight, obesity), related cardiometabolic outcomes (ie,
diabetes mellitus,
insulin resistance, cardiovascular diseases,
hypertension), and study design/epidemiologic methods (ie,
epidemiologic studies, cohort, case-control, clinical trials) by
using exploded versions of nedical subject headings terms and
corresponding key words in titles and abstracts. Additional ar-
ticles were identiﬁed from reference lists of included studies and
relevant reviews. Full details on our search terms and strategy are
shown in Supplemental Table 1 under “Supplemental data” in the
online issue. The current meta-analysis focused on outcomes
related to body weight. Our search strategy included terms for
cardiometabolic outcomes because some of these studies also
report outcomes for body weight.

Studies were considered for inclusion in our meta-analysis if
they met the following criteria: 1) were original research, ie, not
a review, abstract, editorial, letter, or commentary; 2) were
prospective cohort studies or clinical trials conducted in children
or adults; 3) reported multivariable-adjusted coefﬁcients for the
association between SSBs and body weight (any available
metric) from prospective cohort studies or the difference in
changes in body weight (any available metric) between in-
tervention and control groups from clinical trials; 4) did not
combine SSBs with other beverages, foods, or lifestyle factors as
a composite exposure; and 5) had a control group and intervened
for at least 2 wk in clinical trials. We restricted publications to
the English language, and we did not consider cross-sectional or
ecologic studies because they are highly prone to confounding
and reverse causation. Titles and abstracts of identiﬁed studies
were screened, and potentially relevant articles were selected for
full-text review, which was performed independently by 2 in-
vestigators (VSM and AP). Discrepancies were resolved by
consensus or consultation with a third author (FBH).

Data extraction

For each article identiﬁed, we extracted information on study
characteristics (authors, publication year, geographic location,
sample size, and duration), participant characteristics (sex, age,
and baseline body weight), SSB assessment method [food-
frequency questionnaire (FFQ), 24-h recall, or diet record], type
of SSB and serving size, body weight assessment method (mea-
sured, self-report), intervention design (crossover trial, parallel
trial, or cluster RCT), intervention and control modality, and
analysis strategy (statistical models, adjustment for total energy
and covariates). For prospective cohort studies, we extracted
multivariable-adjusted b coefﬁcients and corresponding SEs for
the association between SSBs and any available measure of body
weight. Because total energy intake partly mediates the associ-
ation between SSBs and weight, where possible we extracted

estimates that were not adjusted for total energy. For RCTs,
we extracted means and SDs of changes in body weight (any
available metric) from baseline to the end of follow-up for in-
tervention and control regimens. If a trial did not report the SD
for the measurement of change, we imputed this value by using
the correlation coefﬁcient method referenced in the Cochrane
Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (6). We used
a correlation coefﬁcient of 0.95 because the correlation between
body weights at the 2 time points was assumed to be very high.

Data synthesis and analysis

For a number of studies it was necessary to obtain data from
authors or apply scaling factors and transformations with various
assumptions to generate consistent units for the meta-analyses
(see Supplemental Table 2 under “Supplemental data” in the
online issue). For prospective cohort studies in children, our
primary estimate of interest was the predicted change in BMI
per one 12-oz–serving/d increment of SSBs during the time
period speciﬁed in each study. Studies that reported serving sizes
in units other than 12 oz were scaled accordingly. Studies by
Blum et al (7), Newby et al (8), and Mundt et al (9) were scaled
from 1-oz servings to 12-oz servings. Studies by Striegel-Moore
et al (10), Johnson et al (11), Libuda et al (12), and Olsen et al
(13) were scaled from 100 g/d, 180 g/d, 1 MJ/d, and 10 g/d to
one 12-oz serving/d, respectively. For studies that did not
specify a serving size (14–19), we assumed the standard serving
size of 12 oz. Two studies were converted from servings per
week to servings per day (15, 19). Studies reporting estimates
using BMI z score (7, 12, 13, 18, 20, 21) were converted to BMI
by using the LMS method developed by Cole (22), and studies
reporting estimates of fat mass (kg) were converted to BMI by
dividing the coefﬁcients by average height in meters squared (9,
11). Finally, studies reporting estimates categorically (18, 19)
were converted into continuous variables by assigning medians
to each intake category, which were plotted against weight
change by using least squares linear regression to obtain the
slope (b) and SE. This transformation makes the assumption of
linearity. Because studies evaluating change in SSB intake in
relation to change in weight have some features of a quasi-ex-
perimental design, we conducted a separate meta-analysis for
the 1-y change in BMI per 1-serving/d increment of SSBs by
using studies that reported change versus change estimates (12,
14–17, 19, 21). Units were converted to 1-y change by dividing
b coefﬁcients by the time period speciﬁed in each study (see
Supplemental Table 2 under “Supplemental data” in the online
issue).

For trials in children, our primary estimate of interest was the
mean difference in BMI between intervention and control reg-
imens (see Supplemental Table 2 under “Supplemental data” in
the online issue).

For prospective cohort studies in adults, our primary estimate
of interest was the 1-y change in weight (kg) per 1-serving/d
increment of SSBs by using studies that reported change in
weight in relation to change in SSBs (23–29). Units were con-
verted to 1-y change by dividing coefﬁcients by the time period
speciﬁed in each study, and the serving size was assumed to be
12 oz, consistent with most cans and glasses. Two studies (23,
27) were converted from servings per week to servings per day,
and one study (28) was converted from change in 1 percentage

unit of SSBs to servings per day. The study by Palmer et al (25)
was converted into continuous data by assigning medians to
each intake category, which were plotted against weight change
by using least squares linear regression to obtain the slope (b)
and SE. Data were converted from pounds to kilograms by
multiplying coefﬁcients by 0.45. For trials in adults, the unit of
interest was the mean difference in weight in kilograms from
baseline to end of follow-up between intervention and controls
(see Supplemental Table 2 under “Supplemental data” in the
online issue).

Summary estimates were calculated by combining inverse-
variance–weighted study-speciﬁc estimates using random-
effects models, which accounts for between-study heterogeneity
and is generally considered the more conservative method (6).
Fixed-effects models were also evaluated for comparison. Forest
plots were used to visualize individual and summary estimates,
and the Cochrane Q test and I2
statistic were used to evaluate
between-study heterogeneity (30, 31). An I2
value .50% was
generally considered to be high (32). Potential sources of het-
erogeneity, including adjustment for total energy, duration, age,
dietary assessment method, sample size, and baseline weight
status, were explored by using univariate meta-regressions and
stratiﬁed analyses (36). We also tested the inﬂuence of in-
dividual studies on the results in sensitivity analysis (36). The
potential for publication bias was evaluated by using Begg’s test
and visual inspection of funnel plots (33, 34). All analyses were
performed by using Stata 10.0 (StataCorp).

Risk of bias assessment

Study-level risk of bias was assessed by 2 authors (VSM and
AP), and disagreements in ratings were discussed until con-
sensus. For cohort studies, the Newcastle Ottawa scale was used
(35), which assesses 3 broad areas: the selection of exposed and
unexposed participants, the comparability of the groups, and the
assessment of the outcome. A star was awarded for high quality in
each area, with a maximum of 4 stars for the “Selection” cate-
gory, 2 stars for “Comparability,” and 3 stars for “Outcome.” For
comparability, we awarded a star for studies that provided co-
efﬁcients that did not adjust for total energy intake (36) and for
those that adjusted for age and other important factors. Studies
with a score $7 were considered as good quality and those with
a score ,5 were considered as poor quality. RCTs were re-
viewed by using the Cochrane Collaboration’s risk of bias tool
(6), which rates 7 domains (sequence generation, allocation
concealment, blinding of participants and study personnel,
blinding of outcome assessment, completeness of outcome data,
selective reporting of outcomes, and other threats to validity, eg,
contamination of intervention, baseline imbalance, and carry-
over effect in crossover trials) as having a low risk of bias,
a high risk of bias, or an unclear risk of bias.

RESULTS

Literature search

Our search strategy identiﬁed 9833 unique citations, of which
60 were selected for full-text review after screening titles and
abstracts, plus an additional 5 articles identiﬁed from reference
lists (Figure 1). After reviewing full texts, 33 articles were

additionally excluded. Among cohort studies in children, 11
studies were excluded because we were not able to obtain data in
the necessary units from transformations or author correspon-
dence: 4 presented ORs (37–40), 2 did not report longitudinal
data for SSBs (41, 42), one presented data as frequencies by
weight change group (43), one presented SSBs in grams of
carbohydrate per day by BMI gainers/losers (44), one did not
present weight change data for all categories of beverage intake
(45), one modeled SSBs dichotomously (46), and one presented
standardized b coefﬁcients (47). Among RCTs in children, 2
studies were excluded because one was a follow-up of an in-
cluded trial (48) and the other was conducted in a duplicate
study population (49). Another study was excluded because it
substituted SSBs with ﬂavored milk (50).

Among cohort studies in adults, 6 studies were excluded
because of unavailability of data or heterogeneity of outcome
measures: 2 reported ORs (51, 52), one reported results stratiﬁed
by weight gain before baseline (53), 2 reported BMI rather than
body weight (54, 55), and one presented data in a ﬁgure that could
not be extracted (56). Two studies were additionally excluded
because they were conducted in duplicate study populations (57,
58). Among intervention studies in adults, the study by Raben
et al (59) was excluded because the intervention combined
beverages and foods. We did not include the trial by Tate et al (60)
because unlike other trials, which evaluated the effects of adding
SSBs on body weight, this study substituted SSBs with water or
artiﬁcially sweetened beverages in a context of active weight-loss
intervention (60). Therefore, the data could not be combined
because of the different study questions. After ﬁnal exclusions, 32
original articles were included in our meta-analyses: 20 in
children (15 prospective cohort studies and 5 trials) and 12 in
adults (7 prospective cohort studies and 5 trials). The excluded
studies were evaluated qualitatively.

Study characteristics

Characteristics of the prospective cohort studies included in
our meta-analyses are shown in Tables 1 and 2. Among the 15
cohort studies in children, the majority were from the United
States (n = 10), Europe (n = 4), and Canada (n = 1), with ages at
baseline ranging from 2 to 16 y (Table 1). The number of par-
ticipants in each study ranged from 141 to 11,703, with dura-
tions of follow-up ranging from 6 mo to 14 y. Studies used
a variety of methods to assess diet, including FFQs (n = 5), 24-h
recalls (n = 4), diet and lifestyle questionnaires (n = 3), and diet
records (n = 3); and all studies adjusted for additional diet or
lifestyle risk factors, although 2 studies did not adjust for age
(13, 20) and one study adjusted only for age and time (12). Only
3 studies adjusted for total energy intake (7, 8, 10). Among the 7
cohort studies in adults, the majority were conducted in black or
white populations from the United States (n = 6) and one study
was from the Netherlands (Table 2). Cohorts ranged in size from
173 to 120,877 participants, with durations of follow-up ranging
from 1 to 20 y. Two studies were conducted exclusively in
overweight or obese women (27, 28), and one study was con-
ducted in participants with prehypertension or stage 1 hyper-
tension (26). All but one study (28) used an FFQ to assess diet,
and all studies adjusted for additional diet and lifestyle factors,
although one study did not adjust for age (27). None of the
studies adjusted for total energy intake.

www.thecochranelibrary.com/. SSB, sugar-sweetened beverage.

Characteristics of the RCTs included in our meta-analyses are
shown in Tables 3 and 4. Among the 5 trials conducted in
children and adolescents, 2 were from the United States, 2 were
from Europe, and one was from Brazil (Table 3). All of these
studies evaluated the effect of reducing intake of SSBs on body
weight. Two studies were school-based interventions using fo-
cused nutrition education (61, 62) for 1 school year among 644–
1140 children aged 8–10 y, and 3 studies were randomized trials
replacing SSBs with noncaloric beverages (63–65) for 25 wk to
18 mo among 103–641 children ranging in age from 8 to 16 y.
One trial used a double-blind design (65), and one was con-
ducted exclusively in overweight adolescents (64).

The majority of trials conducted in adults were from Europe (2
United Kingdom, 2 Denmark, 1 Switzerland) and one was from
the United States, with sample sizes ranging from 29 to 133
(Table 4). All studies evaluated the effect of adding SSBs to the
diet on body weight. Most studies compared SSBs (sucrose- or
HFCS-sweetened beverages) with artiﬁcially sweetened bever-
ages in either a parallel (66–68) or crossover (69, 70) design, for
3 wk to 6 mo, with intervention doses ranging from 600 mL to
.1 L SSBs/d. One study included semiskim milk and mineral
water in addition to artiﬁcially sweetened beverages as control
regimens (68), and one study compared SSBs with dietary ad-
vice (70). Three (59, 67, 68) of the 5 studies were conducted
exclusively in overweight individuals.

Risk of bias

Risk of bias is summarized for cohort studies in Supplemental
Table 3 under “Supplemental data” in the online issue. Among
studies in children, scores ranged from 4 (8) to 8 (14, 16, 21) out
of a possible score of 9. Sixty percent of studies received a score
$7, denoting good quality (9, 11, 12, 14, 16, 17, 19–21),
whereas 40% were considered to be of poorer quality (7, 8, 10,
13, 15, 18). Among the 7 studies in adults, 3 studies received
a score of 6, and 4 studies received a score $7 (25, 26, 28, 29).
Risk of bias summaries for RCTs are shown in Supplemental
Table 4 under “Supplemental data” in the online issue. For
studies in children and adults, risk of bias tended to be low or
unclear for most domains assessed. A quantitative summary for
each domain can be found in the footnote to the table.

SSBs and body weight in children
Prospective cohort studies

On the basis of data from 20 comparisons of the 15 studies
(25,745 children and adolescents), we found a positive associ-
ation between SSB consumption and BMI. The pooled estimate
for the change in BMI (in kg/m2) during the time period speciﬁed
in each study associated with each one 12-oz serving/d increase
in SSBs was 0.07 (95% CI: 0.01, 0.12; random-effects model;

Figure 2). Results from the ﬁxed-effects model (0.16; 95% CI:
0.15, 0.16) differed from the random-effects model and was
most likely a result of the high degree of between-study hetero-
geneity (I2
= 91.6%, P-heterogeneity , 0.001). Meta-regressions
for duration (P = 0.51), age (P = 0.70), adjustment for total
energy (P = 0.37), use of an FFQ (P = 0.43), and sample size
(P = 0.95) were not signiﬁcant, suggesting that these factors may
not be substantial sources of heterogeneity. However, when we
stratiﬁed the analysis by whether a study had adjusted for total
energy, the estimate was greater in studies that did not adjust for
total energy (0.08; 95% CI: 0.02, 0.14; I2
= 91.1%; n = 17)
compared with those that did (0.04; 95% CI: 0.00, 0.07; I2
= 0%;
n = 3). In general, studies with greater statistical weight (.5%)
tended to have positive associations, except for the study by
Mundt et al (9). This study (9) along with the study by Johnson
et al (11), evaluated fat mass (kg) as the outcome, which may
not be comparable to BMI despite our scaling. We made the
assumption that differences in fat mass are equal to differences
in body weight, which may not be the case. Excluding these
studies that estimated BMI from fat mass (9, 11) slightly in-
creased the strength of the estimate (0.09; 95% CI: 0.04, 0.15)
but had no impact on heterogeneity (I2
= 90.3%). However,
excluding the study by Viner and Cole (18), which had the
greatest statistical weight, reduced heterogeneity by w23% (I2
=
68.3%), yielding more comparable estimates between the ran-
dom-effects (0.05; 95% CI: 0.01, 0.10) and ﬁxed-effects (0.04;
95% CI: 0.02, 0.06) models.

Our analysis of 1-y change in BMI included 7 studies with 11
comparisons in 15,736 children and adolescents. The summary
estimate indicated that BMI increased by 0.06 (95% CI: 0.02,
0.10; random-effects model) for each additional daily 12-oz
serving of SSBs over a 1-y period (Figure 3). Results from the
ﬁxed-effects model were similar (0.05; 95% CI: 0.03, 0.07), and
signiﬁcant heterogeneity was observed (I2
= 63.8%; P-hetero-
geneity = 0.002). Removing the study by Laurson et al (15) as an
outlier reduced heterogeneity (I2
= 44.4%; P-heterogeneity =
0.07) but did not change the summary estimate (0.06; 95% CI:
0.03, 0.09).

Trials

A total of 5 studies including 2772 children and adolescents
were included in our analysis of SSB trials and body weight. On
the basis of these data, we found a nonsigniﬁcant difference in
change in BMI from reducing SSB consumption [weighted mean
difference (WMD): 20.17; 95% CI: 20.39, 0.05; I2
= 74.6%; P-
heterogeneity = 0.003] in the random-effects model (Figure 4).
Results from the ﬁxed-effects model were signiﬁcant (20.12;
95% CI: 20.22, 20.02). This difference is likely a result of the
random-effects model giving greater statistical weight to smaller
studies and having wider CIs in the presence of heterogeneity
compared with the ﬁxed-effects model. Meta-regressions for
intervention modality (education or beverage substitution; P =
0.08), duration (P = 0.18), and age (P = 0.84) were not signif-
icant, although power to detect a difference was low with only 5
studies. When we stratiﬁed our analysis by intervention mo-
dality, we observed a signiﬁcant weight reduction among the 3
studies that provided noncaloric beverages as substitutes for
SSBs (63–65): the summary estimate was 20.34 (95% CI:
20.50, 20.18; I2
= 0%). In contrast, we did not ﬁnd a signiﬁcant

intervention effect in the 2 studies that used focused school-
based education (61, 62) to discourage SSB consumption (0.01;
95% CI: 20.19, 0.20; I2
= 59.6%). For the study by James et al
(61), although the difference in BMI change did not reach sig-
niﬁcance, there was a signiﬁcant difference in the prevalence of
childhood overweight and obesity between intervention (0.2%
reduction) and control clusters (7.5% increase). This suggests that
the intervention may be more effective in preventing weight gain
in higher risk children. Heterogeneity was reduced when we re-
moved the study by Sichieri et al (62), which had the largest
sample size in the meta-analysis, from the analysis (20.25; 95%
CI: 20.43, 20.06; I2

= 43.8%; P-heterogeneity = 0.15).

All of the studies except for the one by Sichieri et al (62)
showed a beneﬁcial effect or trend of interventions to reduce SSB
intake on weight. The study by Sichieri et al (62) was a school-
based intervention that used focused education to discourage
consumption of carbonated SSBs, but according to the authors,
students compensated by increasing their consumption of sugar-
added juices and fruit drinks, which may explain the lack of
ﬁndings. However, in subgroup analysis, children who were
overweight at baseline showed greater BMI reduction in the
intervention group, which was signiﬁcant among girls (62).
Similarly, Ebbeling et al (63) found more pronounced beneﬁts of
the intervention among adolescents who were overweight at
baseline, and another study by Ebbeling et al (64), which was
conducted exclusively in overweight adolescents, showed the
strongest
intervention effect among studies included in our

analysis. Combining Ebbeling et al (64) with the subgroup
ﬁndings from Ebbeling et al (63), we observed an increased
beneﬁt of substituting noncaloric beverages for SSBs on weight
gain (20.64; 95% CI: 21.07, 20.21), suggesting that this type
of intervention may have greater impact on those who are
overweight. We were not able to include the subgroup ﬁndings
from Sichieri et al (62) in this secondary analysis because the
data were not available in the necessary units.

SSBs and body weight in adults
Prospective cohort studies

Our analysis of 1-y change in weight (kg) in adults was based
on 7 studies, including 8 comparisons and 170,141 men and
women. We found that each serving per day increase in SSBs was
associated with an additional weight gain of 0.22 kg over 1 y (0.22
kg; 95% CI: 0.09, 0.34 kg; I2
= 70.2%; P-heterogeneity , 0.001)
from the random-effects model (Figure 5). The estimate from the
ﬁxed-effects model was signiﬁcant but not as strong (0.12 kg; 95%
CI: 0.10, 0.14 kg). This is probably because the random-effects
model gives greater weight to smaller studies compared with the
ﬁxed-effects model and there are a couple of small studies that are
outliers (estimates that fall outside of the 95% CI of other esti-
mates included in the analysis), such as Barone Gibbs et al (27)
and Chen et al (26). Meta-regressions for age at baseline (P =
0.32), duration (P = 0.37), use of an FFQ to assess diet (P = 0.26),
sample size (P = 0.48), and baseline weight status (P = 0.10) were

not signiﬁcant. However, when we stratiﬁed the analysis by
baseline weight status, we observed greater although nonsigniﬁcant
weight gain in the 2 studies (27, 28) conducted in overweight
populations (1.22 kg; 95% CI: 20.23, 2.68 kg; I2
= 77.5%) com-
pared with nonoverweight populations (0.15 kg; 95% CI: 0.06, 0.24
kg; I2
= 50.3%). Excluding the study by Barone Gibbs et al (27)
from the overall analysis as an outlier reduced heterogeneity
somewhat (I2
= 59.8%). Excluding the study by Mozaffarian et al
(29) from the overall analysis, which had the largest sample size in
the meta-analysis, increased summary estimates for both the ran-
dom-effects model (0.31 kg; 95% CI: 0.11, 0.50 kg) and the ﬁxed-
effects model (0.18 kg; 95% CI: 0.10, 0.26 kg) but did not reduce
heterogeneity (I2

= 71.3%).

Trials

A total of 5 studies including 6 comparisons with 292 men and
women were included in our analysis of trials in adults. We found
a signiﬁcant difference in change in body weight (kg) between in-
tervention and control regimens (WMD: 0.85; 95% CI: 0.50, 1.20;
I2
= 0.0%; P-heterogeneity = 0.78) from the random-effects

model (Figure 6). The estimate from the ﬁxed-effects model
was identical. All studies observed signiﬁcantly greater weight
gain or trends toward greater weight gain in intervention com-
pared with control regimens, and there was no evidence of het-
erogeneity. When we stratiﬁed our analysis by baseline weight
status, we observed greater weight gain in intervention com-
pared with control regimens among the 3 studies conducted in
nonoverweight populations (WMD: 0.89; 95% CI: 0.52, 1.26;
I2
= 0.0%;) compared with the 2 studies conducted in over-
weight populations (WMD: 0.47; 95% CI: 20.70, 1.63; I2
=
0.0%;). Adding the study by Raben et al (59) to the analysis,
which was excluded because the intervention contained some
foods in addition to beverages (w70% beverages and 30%
food), increased the overall estimate but introduced some het-
erogeneity (WMD: 1.06; 95% CI: 0.54, 1.58; I2
= 46.3%;
P-heterogeneity = 0.08).

Begg’s test suggested that publication bias was unlikely in our
analyses in children (all prospective cohort studies, P = 0.12;
prospective cohort studies evaluating change versus change, P =
0.88; trials, P = 0.47) and in trials in adults (P = 0.59). However,
for cohorts in adults there was suggestion of publication bias (P
= 0.02). This may be due to the lack of estimates in the bottom
right quadrant of the funnel plot, indicating a lack of publication
of small, null studies. However, this is complicated by the nar-
row spread of studies about the plot, which is likely a result of
the preponderance of large studies.

Qualitative review of studies not included in meta-analyses

A number of prospective cohort studies evaluating SSB
consumption and body weight in both children and adults were
excluded from our meta-analyses because we were not able to
obtain data in the necessary units from either transformations or
author correspondence. Among these studies in children, 9 of 11
supported the ﬁndings from our meta-analysis of a positive as-
sociation between SSBs and body weight (37–39, 41, 42, 44–47),
whereas 2 did not ﬁnd an association (40, 43). Four studies
found signiﬁcant positive associations between SSB consump-
tion and weight gain (44–47), with one study reporting associ-
ations
found positive
associations between SSB consumption and risk of developing

(46). Four

studies

overweight or obesity (37–39, 42), with one study reporting sig-
niﬁcant associations only among children who were at risk of
becoming overweight at baseline (37). One small study (n = 49)
found a positive association between SSB consumption and
change in waist circumference but not BMI z score among chil-
dren followed from age 3 to 6 y (41). Among studies that did not
ﬁnd an association between SSBs and childhood body weight,
Wijga et al (40) suggested that their lack of ﬁndings among 1871
Dutch children followed from age 5 to 8 y might have been a re-
sult of reverse causation and selective underreporting by parents of
children who became overweight. In the study by Sugimori et al
(43), which was conducted in a cohort of 8170 Japanese children
followed from age 3 to 6 y, consumption amounts may have been
too low to observe signiﬁcant between-group differences.

Similar to studies in children, the majority (4 of 6) of cohort
studies in adults that were excluded as a result of difﬁculty in
obtaining optimal units found positive associations between
SSBs and body weight in either primary analysis or subgroup
ﬁndings (52, 53, 55, 56), whereas 2 studies did not ﬁnd signiﬁcant
associations (51, 54). Among studies that evaluated baseline SSB
consumption and weight change, Bes-Rastrollo et al (53) found
that higher SSB consumption was associated with signiﬁcant
weight gain among subjects with previous weight gain ($3 kg in
5 y before baseline) in a cohort of 7194 adults from Spain fol-
lowed for over 2 y. Odegaard et al (56) found that individuals

with higher SSB consumption had a subtle but signiﬁcant in-
crease in weight (0.53 kg) compared with those who did not
consume soft drinks (P , 0.001) in a large cohort (n = 43,580)
of Chinese Singaporeans with a mean weight change of 0.10 kg
over 5.7 y. In contrast, Fowler et al (54) did not ﬁnd an asso-
ciation between SSBs and change in BMI in a small (n = 3371)
US cohort. The authors did, however, ﬁnd a positive association
between artiﬁcially sweetened beverages and BMI change,
which they largely ascribed to reverse causation. Two studies
(52, 55) evaluating baseline SSB intake and risk of obesity
found signiﬁcant positive associations, although the association
was signiﬁcant only in women in the study by Inoue et al (55):
a Japanese cohort that included .75% women. The study by
Kvavvik et al (51), which evaluated change in SSBs and risk of
obesity in a small cohort from Norway (n = 422), found that risk
was increased for long-term high-SSB consumers ($3 servings/
wk) compared with long-term low consumers, although this
ﬁnding was not signiﬁcant. Two large cohort studies (57, 58),
which were excluded because they were conducted in duplicate
populations of Mozaffarian et al (29), found signiﬁcant positive
associations between SSB consumption and weight change.

Among trials in children not included in our meta-analysis, one
found an adverse effect of SSBs and body weight (49), whereas 2
did not ﬁnd signiﬁcant effects (48, 50), although the study by

James et al (48) was a follow-up analysis of a previous school-
based intervention (61). This study (48), along with the recent
RCT by Ebbeling et al (64), examined the sustained effects of
their interventions on body weight at 2 and 1 y postintervention,
respectively. Both of these studies found that the beneﬁcial ef-
fects of the interventions dissipated after the interventions had
ended. We combined these studies and observed a summary
WMD in BMI between the intervention and control of 20.26
(95% CI: 20.53, 0.03), suggesting that, despite a beneﬁcial
trend, the interventions did not have a sustained effect on weight
gain, highlighting the importance of active intervention. The
study by Albala et al (50), which evaluated replacing SSBs with
ﬂavored milk beverages providing 80 kcal and 11 g carbohy-
drate/serving, did not ﬁnd a beneﬁcial intervention effect on
body weight. In contrast, the study by Sichieri et al (49), which
was excluded from our meta-analysis because it was a duplicate
study population, conﬁrmed that consumption of SSBs is a sig-
niﬁcant risk factor for BMI gain.

Among 2 studies that were excluded from our analysis of trials
in adults, one found an adverse effect of SSBs on body weight
(59), whereas the other evaluated a different study question re-
lated to weight loss (60). The study by Raben et al (59) was
excluded because the intervention combined beverages and foods
but found that body weight and fat mass increased in overweight

participants who consumed sucrose (mostly from beverages) and
decreased in those who consumed artiﬁcial sweeteners after 10
wk. The study by Tate et al (60) found that participants who were
assigned to caloric beverage replacement with water and diet
beverages compared with controls were twice as likely to have
achieved a 5% weight loss during 6 mo, although no signiﬁcant
between-group differences in weight reduction were found.

DISCUSSION

Findings from our systematic review and meta-analyses of
prospective cohort studies and trials showed an overall positive
association between consumption of SSBs and body weight gain
in both children and adults with the exception of trials in children
from the random-effects model. On the basis of the totality of the
available evidence from prospective cohort studies, a 1-serving/d
increase in SSBs was associated with a 0.06-unit increase in BMI
over a 1-y period among children and adolescents and an ad-
ditional weight gain of 0.12 to 0.22 kg (w0.25–0.50 lb) over 1 y
among adults. In children, it is difﬁcult to gauge the impact of
our ﬁndings, because weight gain in childhood varies as a
function of age, maturation, and growth velocity. Adult weight
gain in the general population is a gradual process, occurring
over decades and averaging w1 lb/y (29). Thus, eliminating
SSBs from the diet could be an effective way to prevent age-
related weight gain.

Our ﬁndings from trials generally support those from pro-
spective cohort studies. Trials in children were of 2 modalities,
either reducing SSBs by substitution with noncaloric beverages
or school-based education programs aimed at discouraging intake
of SSBs. In sensitivity analysis, we showed that the substitution
trials, which included 2 recent trials that were the most rigorous to
date (64, 65), resulted in signiﬁcantly less BMI gain compared
with the education interventions. Some of the trials in our
analysis were “effectiveness trials” of behavioral modiﬁcation
(eg, school-based education programs), which are useful
in
evaluating real-world scenarios for policy decisions. However,
these studies evaluate intervention modalities more so than
causal relations because their ﬁndings are greatly affected by
intervention intensity and adherence. Thus, a lack of beneﬁt
does not mean that the relation between SSBs and weight gain is
not causal but rather that the given modality might not be ef-
fective at changing behaviors.

The current set of analyses support ﬁndings from our previous
systematic review in children and adults (3) and meta-analysis in
children (4), both of which reported a signiﬁcant link between
SSB consumption and weight gain. Our previous meta-analysis
(4) was a reanalysis of an article that did not ﬁnd an association
between SSBs and BMI in children resulting from methodologic
errors and inclusion of coefﬁcients that adjusted for total energy
intake (71). In contrast to these previous meta-analyses (4, 71),
here we conducted separate analyses for prospective cohort

studies and trials, qualitatively reviewed studies that were not
included in our analyses, and independently evaluated prospec-
tive cohort studies that used a change versus change analysis.
This type of analysis has some of the features of a quasi-
experimental design, although it lacks the element of randomi-
zation in a clinical trial. An advantage of this design is the
generalizability to a noncontrolled setting, relative to a controlled
setting, because participants are able to change their diet and
lifestyle without investigator-driven intervention. We also in-
cluded a number of more recent cohort studies (11–15, 18, 19,
21) and trials (62, 64, 65) in children that were not included in
these previous analyses. To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst meta-
analysis to evaluate prospective cohort studies of SSBs and body
weight in adults. A previous meta-analysis of 6 trials found
a signiﬁcant dose-dependent increase in weight among studies
that added SSBs to the diet but found no effect on BMI among
another 6 trials that attempted to reduce SSBs (72). However,
a signiﬁcant beneﬁt on body weight was observed among in-
dividuals who were overweight at baseline (72), a ﬁnding that
we also observed in children. These analyses combined studies
in children and adults and included various trials excluded from
our analyses, such as a study that substituted ﬂavored milk for
SSBs (50), a doctoral dissertation, and a study of postinter-
vention follow-up after completion of the trial (48). Our anal-
yses also included more recent trials in children (64, 65) and
adults (67, 68, 70).

The studies included in our meta-analyses varied substantially
with respect to study design, exposure assessment, adjustment for
covariates, and speciﬁc outcomes evaluated. Although we did not
identify these factors as signiﬁcant sources of heterogeneity, we
cannot rule them out. Estimates from cohort studies are also
likely to be underestimated because of random measurement
error in SSB assessment. The relatively high degree of un-
explained heterogeneity observed in our analyses may limit the
validity of our summary estimates. In addition, the data trans-
formations that we performed to obtain consistent units across
studies may further limit the validity of our estimates by imposing
various assumptions. Our assumption of a 12-oz serving size for
some studies, which is consistent with most cans and glasses, may
have introduced some random misclassiﬁcation and further at-
tenuated our estimates. Publication bias is always a potential
concern in meta-analysis, but standard tests and visual inspection
of funnel plots suggested that there was limited evidence for
publication bias in most of our analyses. In addition, we were not
able to include a number of studies in our analysis because of
difﬁculty in obtaining consistent units; however, these studies
were reviewed qualitatively. Ascertainment of unpublished re-
sults via author correspondence may have reduced the likelihood
of publication bias, but it should be noted that our search was
limited to English-language publications and non-English reports
may exist.

Because observed associations between SSBs and weight may
be confounded by other diet and lifestyle factors, some scholars
have put into question the validity of ﬁndings from observational
studies. However, all of the cohort studies in our meta-analyses
adjusted for potential confounding by various diet and lifestyle
factors, and for most, a positive association persisted, suggesting
an independent effect of SSBs, although residual confounding by
unmeasured or poorly measured factors cannot be dismissed.
Results from rigorously conducted RCTs also support conclusions

from our observational analyses, further lending to their validity.
Risk of bias assessment suggested that most cohort studies were
of good quality and the majority of trials had a low or unclear risk
of bias for the domains that were evaluated. Longitudinal studies
evaluating diet and weight may also be prone to reverse cau-
sation. Although it is not possible to completely eliminate this
issue, studies with longer durations and repeated measures as in
our change versus change analyses are less prone to this process
(73).

SSBs can lead to weight gain through their high added-sugar
content, low satiety, and an incomplete compensatory reduction
in energy intake at subsequent meals after intake of liquid cal-
ories (3). On average, SSBs contain 140–150 calories and 35.0–
37.5 g sugar per 12-oz serving. In addition, fructose from any
sugar or HFCS has been shown to promote development of
visceral adiposity and ectopic fat deposition (74–77). Odegaard
et al (78) recently found in a cross-sectional analysis that in-
creased SSB consumption was associated with an adverse ab-
dominal adipose tissue deposition pattern. Numerous societies
and organizations including the American Heart Association, the
American Academy of Pediatrics, and the US 2010 Dietary
Guidelines technical review committee have called for re-
ductions in intake of SSBs to help prevent obesity and improve
overall health. Our meta-analyses offer additional support for
these recommendations. Our results also suggest the need for
targeted strategies to reduce SSB consumption among high-risk
populations, particularly children who are already overweight to
prevent further weight gain, and highlight the importance of
sustained strategies. The studies included in our analyses eval-
uated risk or prevention of weight gain rather than weight loss.
From a public health point of view, identifying dietary determinants
of weight gain is critical for reducing obesity prevalence because
once an individual becomes obese, it is increasingly difﬁcult to
achieve and maintain weight loss (79).

In conclusion, our systematic review and meta-analyses pro-
vide additional evidence that SSB consumption is associated with
weight gain in both children and adults. Our ﬁndings have broad
implications for developing public health strategies and policies
targeting SSBs for weight control and obesity prevention.

Carbohydrates, dietary fiber, and incident type 2 diabetes in older
women1–3

Katie A Meyer, Lawrence H Kushi, David R Jacobs Jr, Joanne Slavin, Thomas A Sellers, and Aaron R Folsom

ABSTRACT
Background: Dietary carbohydrates may influence the develop-
ment  of  type  2  (non-insulin-dependent)  diabetes, for  example,
through effects on blood glucose and insulin concentrations.
Objective: We examined the relations of baseline intake of car-
bohydrates, dietary fiber, dietary magnesium, and carbohydrate-
rich foods and the glycemic index with incidence of diabetes.
Design: This  was  a  prospective  cohort  study  of  35 988  older
Iowa women initially free of diabetes. During 6 y of follow-up,
1141 incident cases of diabetes were reported.
Results: Total grain, whole-grain, total dietary fiber, cereal fiber,
and  dietary  magnesium  intakes  showed  strong  inverse  associa-
tions  with  incidence  of  diabetes  after  adjustment  for  potential
nondietary  confounding  variables.  Multivariate-adjusted  relative
risks of diabetes were 1.0, 0.99, 0.98, 0.92, and 0.79 (P for trend:
0.0089)  across  quintiles  of  whole-grain  intake;  1.0, 1.09, 1.00,
0.94, and 0.78 (P for trend: 0.005) across quintiles of total dietary
fiber  intake;  and  1.0, 0.81, 0.82, 0.81, and  0.67  (P for  trend:
0.0003) across quintiles of dietary magnesium intake. Intakes of
total carbohydrates, refined grains, fruit and vegetables, and sol-
uble fiber and the glycemic index were unrelated to diabetes risk.
Conclusion: These data support a protective role for grains (par-
ticularly  whole  grains), cereal  fiber, and  dietary  magnesium  in
the development of diabetes in older women.

INTRODUCTION

Despite the public health significance of type 2 diabetes, rela-
tively little is understood about the role of diet in the development
of this disease. Diet is known to influence body weight and thus
is recognized as a modifiable risk factor for type 2 diabetes (1).
Other  effects  of  diet  in  the  etiology  of  diabetes  are  not  widely
endorsed. This is illustrated by a recent position statement by the
American Dietetic Association supporting dietary modification in
the management, but not the prevention, of diabetes (2).

Findings  from  metabolic  and  epidemiologic  studies  on  the
relations  between  carbohydrates  and  dietary  fiber  and  diabetes
are inconsistent. Evidence from metabolic studies supports bene-

ficial  (3), detrimental  (4, 5), and  neutral  (6)  effects  of  a  high-
carbohydrate diet relative to high-fat diets on glycemic response.
The  results  of  ecologic  and  cross-sectional  studies  support
decreased prevalences of diabetes with high intakes of carbohy-
drate (7–9), whereas the results of cohort studies do not support
an  association  between  diabetes  and  total  dietary  carbohydrate
(10–13).  Dietary  fiber  is  reported  to  improve  the  postprandial
glycemic  response  and  insulin  concentrations, most  likely  by
slowing  the  digestion  and  absorption  of  food  and  by  regulating
several metabolic hormones (14, 15). However, results on dietary
fiber and diabetes from prospective and case-control studies have
been mixed (7, 11, 12, 16). Magnesium is a component of grains
and  is  found  in  the  fibrous  component  of  cereal  plants.  Dietary
magnesium  was  inversely  related  to  incident  type  2  diabetes  in
some (11, 12), but not all (17), prospective cohort studies.

Clinical  work  on  the  glycemic  index  and  the  glycemic  load
supports  the  notion  that  the  form  and  content  of  carbohydrate
and fat in foods may be important determinants of the short-term
glycemic response (18). The glycemic index and glycemic load
were  directly  related  to  diabetes  risk  in  2  large  cohort  studies
(11, 12).  In  addition, recent  attention  has  been  directed  to  the
potential  effects  of  whole  compared  with  refined  grains  on  the

compared with refined-grain food intake on incident diabetes has
not been widely examined in the epidemiologic literature.

We examined the relations between incident diabetes and car-
bohydrate-related dietary variables in the Iowa Women’s Health
Study, a  large  cohort  study  of  older  women.  Detailed  dietary
information collected at baseline enabled us to examine the long-
term effects on diabetes incidence of several variables, including
dietary carbohydrates, dietary fiber, the glycemic index and load,
dietary magnesium, and carbohydrate-rich foods such as whole

grains. These findings contribute to the long-standing discussion
of the importance of carbohydrates and dietary fiber in the etiol-
ogy  of  diabetes  as  well  as  to  the  relatively  recent  focus  on
glycemic index, the glycemic load, and whole-grain intake.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS

Subjects

The Iowa Women’s Health Study is a prospective cohort study
of postmenopausal Iowa women. In January 1986, a random sam-
ple of 99 826 women aged 55–69 y who had a valid Iowa driver’s
license were mailed a 16-page questionnaire and asked to partic-
ipate in the study. The present study sample is composed of those
41 836  women  who  returned  the  baseline  questionnaire.  Com-
pared  with  nonresponders, responders  had  a  mean  body  mass
index (BMI; in kg/m2) that was smaller by <0.4, were 3 mo older,
and were more likely to live in rural, less-affluent counties (20).
Women  were  excluded  from  these  analyses  if  they  reported
implausibly high (>20 920 kJ) or low (< 2510 kJ) energy intakes
(n = 538), left ‡ 30 items blank on the food-frequency question-
naire (n = 2782), or had diabetes at baseline (n = 3121). Women
were  considered  diabetic  at  baseline  if  they  responded  “yes” or
“don’t know” to the following questions: Have you ever been told
by  a  doctor  that  you  have  sugar  diabetes  (diabetes  mellitus)?
(n = 2947) and Have you ever taken insulin or pills for sugar dia-
betes  (or  to  lower  blood  sugar)?  (n = 2747).  A  total  of  35988
women remained eligible for the study. The study was approved
by  the  Human  Subjects  Review  Committee  at  the  University  of
Minnesota.

Data collection

The  baseline  questionnaire  included  questions  on  known  or
suspected risk factors for diabetes, including age, BMI, waist-
to-hip ratio (WHR), physical activity, and smoking history. BMI
was calculated from weight and height measurements provided
by  the  participants.  WHR  was  calculated  as  the  average  of  2
measurements  taken  by  the  participant’s  spouse  or  a  friend
using a paper tape measure included with the questionnaire (21).
A  3-level  physical  activity  score  was  created  by  combining
questions  on  the  frequency  of  moderate  and  vigorous  leisure-
time activity. Pack-years of smoking (number of packs of ciga-
rettes  smoked  daily  times  the  number  of  years  smoked)  were
calculated  from  information  on  the  intensity  and  duration  of
cigarette smoking.

The principal dietary exposure of interest was intake of car-
bohydrates, including dietary fiber. This variable was examined
by analyzing food sources of carbohydrates, subtypes of carbo-
hydrates, components of carbohydrates, and the glycemic index
and  load.  The  food  groups  analyzed  included  grains, vegeta-
bles, fruit, and legumes. Total grain intake was subdivided into
refined and whole grains as outlined previously (22). In addi-
tion  to  total  dietary  carbohydrates, starch, sucrose, glucose,
fructose, maltose, and  lactose  were  analyzed  individually.
Because the physiologic effects of fiber may relate to subtype
(23), soluble  and  insoluble  fiber  were  analyzed  separately.
Also, total  dietary  fiber  was  divided  into  mutually  exclusive
categories representing fiber contributed to the diet by cereals,
fruit, vegetables, and legumes.

A 127-item food-frequency questionnaire similar to that used
in the 1984 Nurses’ Health Study was used to assess typical food

intake over the previous year (24). The validity of the food-fre-
quency questionnaire was evaluated in this cohort by comparing
nutrient  values  determined  from  the  questionnaire  with  values
estimated from the average of five 24-h dietary recall surveys in
44  study  participants.  Energy-adjusted  Pearson’s  correlation
coefficients for total carbohydrates and crude fiber were 0.45 and
0.24, respectively (25).

The glycemic index and glycemic load variables measure the
glycemic response and insulin demand that result from specific
carbohydrate-containing  foods.  The  glycemic  index  and  load
values  were  available  for  most  foods  and  were  calculated  as
described  by  Salmerón  et  al  (11, 12).  The  average  dietary
glycemic index for each individual was calculated as follows:

{^[(Servings of food per day) 
3 (carbohydrate content of food) 
3 (glycemic index)]}
/total carbohydrate in diet

(1)

Similarly, a glycemic load score was obtained for each individ-
ual as follows:

^ [(Servings of food per day) 
3 (carbohydrate content of food) 
3 (glycemic index)]

(2)

Diabetes incidence was determined by an affirmative response
to the following question on one of the follow-up surveys: Since
(baseline  or  respective  follow-up), were  you  diagnosed  for  the
first time by a doctor as having sugar diabetes? Over 6 y of fol-
low-up, 1141 women reported having diabetes in the 3 follow-up
surveys  administered  in  1987  (n = 344), 1989  (n = 331), and
1992 (n = 466). Response rates for the 3 follow-up surveys were
91%, 86%, and 79%, respectively.

A  validation  study  of  self-reported  diabetes  was  conducted
with 85 cohort participants in 1988 after the first follow-up sur-
vey  (26).  Subjects  tended  to  overreport  diabetes: of  44  women
who  reported  diabetes  at  baseline, 28  (64%)  were  confirmed  as
being diabetic by their physician. All 41 women who reported not
having diabetes at baseline were confirmed as not being diabetic.

Statistical analysis

Person-time  of  follow-up  was  calculated  for  each  study  par-
ticipant as follows. For those women who did not report a diag-
nosis  of  diabetes, person-time  was  calculated  from  baseline  to
the  date  of  the  last  completed  questionnaire.  For  women  who
reported having been diagnosed with diabetes on one of the fol-
low-up  surveys, person-time  was  calculated  as  the  sum  of  the
known  disease-free  period  and  half  of  the  period  during  which
the  diagnosis  was  first  made.  Mortality  status  was  determined
annually through linkage with the State Health Registry of Iowa.
In addition, nonrespondents to the 3 follow-up surveys and emi-
grants from Iowa were linked with the National Death Index.

Dietary variables were categorized as appropriate for analysis.
Relative risks calculated with proportional hazards regression are
comparisons between the upper categories of intake and the low-
est category. Trend analyses weighted each category of intake by
the median intake for that category. Nutrient intakes were adjusted
for total energy by the method described by Willett and Stampfer
(27). Initial analyses were adjusted only for age and total energy.
Further analyses were also adjusted for potential confounders of
the observed diet-diabetes associations, including physical activ-
ity, BMI, WHR, smoking, alcohol  intake, and  education.  Addi-

tional  analyses  excluded  women  who  reported  having  cancer
(n = 3202) or heart disease (n = 3110) at baseline (because these
women may have recently modiﬁed their diets) and controlled for
reported  family  history  of  diabetes  in  a  ﬁrst-degree  relative
(mother, father, brother, or  sister), which  was  asked  only  in  the
third follow-up. The SAS package was used (28).

RESULTS

Age-adjusted  relative  risks  (RRs)  of  diabetes  were  1.0,
0.67, and 0.55 (P for trend: 0.0001) for low, medium, and high
physical activity, respectively. RRs were also notable for ever
versus never drinking alcohol (RR: 0.62; 95% CI: 0.55, 0.70)
and a family history of diabetes in a first-degree relative ver-
sus  no  family  history  (RR: 2.60;  95%  CI: 2.31, 2.93).  As
shown previously, BMI and WHR strongly predicted diabetes
in  this  cohort  (26). Age-adjusted  RRs  were  1.0, 1.92, 3.38,
5.70, and 10.86 (P for trend: 0.0001) across quintiles of WHR
and 1.0, 2.39, 2.98, 6.50, and 14.59 (P for trend: 0.0001) across
quintiles of BMI.

The  distribution  of  these  risk  factors  across  quintiles  of
whole-grain  and  energy-adjusted  dietary  fiber  intake  are
shown in Table 1. Trends in most covariates across quintiles
of dietary intakes were statistically significant. However, this
was assuredly due to the large sample size, and the trends of

only  some  covariates  can  be  presumed  to  be  clinically  rele-
vant.  For  example, women  who  reported  higher  intakes  of
whole  grains  and  dietary  fiber  at  baseline  were  appreciably
more  likely  to  have  engaged  in  vigorous  physical  activity,
have graduated from high school, have been nonsmokers, and
have had low WHRs. In addition, the prevalence of abstinence
from alcohol was 11% higher for women in the highest cate-
gory of dietary fiber intake than for women in the lowest cat-
egory of intake.

The  multivariate-adjusted  analyses  for  intakes  of  total  car-
bohydrate, starch, and  sugars  are  shown  in  Table  2.  After
adjustment for potential confounding variables, total carbohy-
drates, starch, lactose, and maltose were unrelated to incidence
of  diabetes.  RRs  across  total  carbohydrate  quintiles  were  1.0,
1.05, 0.98, 0.90, 0.93 (P for trend: 0.22). Sucrose was inversely
associated  with  incidence  of  diabetes.  Women  in  the  highest
quintile  of  sucrose  intake  had  an  RR  of  0.81  compared  with
women  in  the  lowest  quintile.  Glucose  and  fructose  intakes
were positively associated with diabetes risk. The RRs compar-
ing the highest quintile of intake with the lowest were 1.30 and
1.27  for  glucose  and  fructose, respectively. Age-  and  energy-
adjusted  risk  estimates  were  similar  to  the  multivariate-
adjusted findings, except that total carbohydrate intake showed
a  stronger  inverse  relation  to  type  2  diabetes  in  the  age-  and
energy-adjusted  model.  The  RR  estimates  in  the  age-  and

(P for trend: 0.018) across quintiles of intake.

The  glycemic  index  and  glycemic  load  were  not  associated
with diabetes in these data (Table 3). The pattern of risk across
quintiles  of  glycemic  index  was  inconsistent;  RRs  first  rose  to
1.22  in  quintile  3  and  then  dropped  to  0.84  in  quintile  5.
Glycemic load was nonsignificantly inversely related to diabetes.
These findings did not appear to have been due to confounding
or effect modification by dietary fiber intake. Relative risk esti-
mates were similar in age- and energy-adjusted analyses.

The multivariate-adjusted RRs of diabetes across quintiles of
total  dietary  fiber, insoluble  fiber, and  soluble  fiber  intake  and
fiber obtained from cereal, fruit, vegetable, and legume sources

are shown in Table 4. In the multivariate analysis, total dietary
fiber  was  inversely  associated  with  diabetes  risk  (RR = 0.78
comparing the fifth with the first quintile of intake; P for trend:
0.005).  Intake  of  insoluble  fiber  was  inversely  associated  with
diabetes risk, whereas intake of soluble fiber did not appear to be
strongly related to diabetes risk. Women in the highest quintile
of  intake  had  RRs  of  0.89  and  0.75  for  soluble  and  insoluble
fiber, respectively, compared with women in the first quintile of
intake. Fiber derived from cereals was also inversely associated
with diabetes (RR = 0.64 for the highest versus the lowest quin-
tile). Fiber derived from fruit, vegetables, or legumes was unre-
lated to diabetes risk. Also shown in Table 4 are the multivariate-
adjusted  RRs  of  diabetes  across  quintiles  of  intake  of  dietary

total dietary ﬁber intake.

magnesium, which is found in the fibrous component of cereal
plants. There was an inverse relation between dietary magnesium
and type 2 diabetes.

Results  from  the  multivariate-adjusted  analyses  shown  in
Table 4 and the age- and energy-adjusted analyses did not differ
appreciably. Exceptions to this were an inverse relation between
diabetes  and  soluble  fiber  and  the  lack  of  an  association
between  diabetes  and  fiber  from  fruit  in  the  age-  and  energy-
adjusted analyses. Relative risks in the age- and energy-adjusted
analysis were 1.00, 0.91, 0.94, 0.86, and 0.77 (P for trend: 0.0046)
across  quintiles  of  soluble  fiber  intake  and  1.00, 0.96, 1.12,
0.97, and 1.05 (P for trend: 0.63) across quintiles of fiber intake
from fruit.

Associations  between  diabetes  and  food  groups  that  con-
tribute carbohydrates and fiber to the diet were also examined
(Table  5).  Consistent  with  the  finding  for  cereal  fiber, total
grain intake was inversely related to incident diabetes. The mul-
tivariate-adjusted RR comparing the fifth and first quintiles of
total grain intake was 0.68 (95% CI: 0.54, 0.87). Whole grains
were  more  strongly  inversely  associated  with  risk  of  diabetes
than  were  refined  grains.  Women  in  the  highest  quintile  of
whole grain intake had an adjusted RR of 0.79 (95% CI: 0.65,
0.96) compared with women in the lowest quintile (P for trend:
0.0089).  Intakes  of  fruit, vegetables, and  legumes  were  not
strongly related to diabetes risk. These findings from the multi-
variate analysis differed only slightly from the age- and energy-
adjusted  estimates  and  the  interpretation  of  findings  did  not
change  with  adjustment  for  potential  confounding  factors.  For

example, age- and energy-adjusted RRs for whole grain intake
were  1.00, 0.86, 0.92, 0.83, and  0.70  (P for  trend: 0.0029)
across quintiles of intake.

Inclusion of family history of diabetes as a covariate did not
substantially alter the risk estimates presented in Tables 2–5. To
control for recent dietary changes, multivariate models were also
run that excluded women who reported cancer or heart disease at
baseline.  Relative  risk  estimates  were  not  appreciably  changed
by these exclusions.

Results from multivariate regression models that included more
than one of the dietary components under study are shown in Table 6.
Dietary  intakes  of  foods  and  nutrients  are  highly  correlated  and
these  models  were  intended  to  help  distinguish  the  effects  of
dietary variables that appeared related to type 2 diabetes in these
data. Each of the 4 models was adjusted for the covariates listed in
the footnote as well as for the dietary components listed below the
model  headings.  Because  our  ﬁndings  were  strongest  for  grain
intake, these analyses focused on the effects of adjusting grains for
cereal  ﬁber  and  dietary  magnesium, 2  components  of  grains  that
were strongly related to type 2 diabetes in these data. Results for
total grains and whole grains were attenuated after the models were
adjusted for cereal ﬁber. For example, RRs were 1.00, 1.01, 1.02,
1.01, and 0.93 (P for trend: 0.46) across quintiles of whole-grain
intake. However, both cereal ﬁber and dietary magnesium remained
signiﬁcantly and inversely related to type 2 diabetes. Simultaneous
adjustment for grains, cereal grains, and dietary magnesium atten-
uated  the  ﬁndings  for  cereal  ﬁber  and  dietary  magnesium, but
inverse dose-response relations were still apparent for these 2 grain

components.  For  example, RRs  from  model  4  were  1.00, 0.93,
0.90, 0.80, and 0.71 (P for trend: 0.0017) across quintiles of cereal
ﬁber intake and 1.00, 0.82, 0.86, 0.88, and 0.76 (P for trend: 0.048)
across quintiles of dietary magnesium intake. Overall, these ﬁnd-
ings suggest that the inverse relation between whole-grain intake
and type 2 diabetes may be due to ﬁber and components of whole
grains that are highly correlated with ﬁber.

DISCUSSION

This prospective study of older women indicates that dietary
carbohydrates  may  influence  the  risk  of  type  2  diabetes. After
multivariate adjustment for several risk factors for diabetes, the
data suggested strong inverse associations between incidence of
diabetes and intakes of total grains, whole grains, dietary fiber,
cereal fiber, and dietary magnesium.

The relation between dietary fiber and diabetes has received
much attention (11, 12, 14–16, 29–36). Fiber, particularly solu-
ble  fiber, has  repeatedly  been  shown  to  decrease  postprandial
glucose and insulin concentrations both in persons with diabetes
and  in  those  without  (36).  In  addition, several  cross-sectional
epidemiologic  studies  reported  inverse  associations  of  serum
insulin with fiber intake (30–34).

In the present study, women in the highest quintile of dietary
fiber intake had a 22% lower risk of developing diabetes than did
women  in  the  lowest  quintile.  These  data  corroborate  a  report
from the Nurses’ Health Study in which a similar magnitude of
diabetes  risk  was  associated  with  dietary  fiber  intake  (11).  In
contrast, in a cohort of male health professionals, no association
was found between diabetes risk and total dietary ﬁber intake (12).

Similarly, no association was seen in a case-control study of 702
men  and  women  (16).  The  20-y  follow-up  of  the  Finnish  and
Dutch cohorts of the Seven Countries Study yielded no associa-
tion  of  dietary  fiber  with  impaired  glucose  tolerance  or  diag-
nosed diabetes (35).

The  plasma  glucose–lowering  effects  of  fiber  are  attributed
primarily to soluble fiber, which slows the absorption of food by
creating  a  gel-like  substance  in  the  stomach  (14, 36).  For  this
reason, a stronger inverse association between soluble fiber and
diabetes risk than between insoluble fiber and diabetes risk was
expected. Insoluble fiber may also slow the absorption of food
(36). The finding that insoluble fiber, but not soluble fiber, was
inversely associated with diabetes risk is consistent with previ-
ous reports from other cohort studies. The Nurses’ Health Study

reported  that  of  the  associations  of  diabetes  with  different
sources  of  dietary  fiber, only  the  inverse  association  between
cereal fiber and diabetes remained statistically significant after
multivariate adjustment (11). In the Health Professionals’ Fol-
low-up  Study, cereal  fiber  was  inversely  associated  with  dia-
betes risk, whereas fiber from fruit and vegetables was unrelated
to diabetes risk (12). The findings from these prospective cohort
studies, all  of  which  used  a  similar  questionnaire, support  a
stronger association of insoluble fiber than of soluble fiber with
diabetes risk.

Our ﬁndings indicate a strong inverse relation between dietary
magnesium intake—a component of grains—and risk of type 2 dia-
betes. This ﬁnding remained after adjustment for cereal ﬁber and
grain intakes. In clinical studies, low plasma magnesium concen-
trations were associated with insulin resistance (37), and magne-
sium  supplementation  was  shown  to  improve  glucose  handling
(38).  Findings  from  2  large  prospective  studies  suggested  strong
inverse  relations  between  magnesium  intake  and  incident  type  2
diabetes (11, 12) and fasting insulin concentrations (39). For exam-
ple, Salmerón et al (11, 12) reported a 38% decreased risk of dia-
betes for persons in the highest quintile of magnesium intake com-
pared  with  the  lowest  quintile  of  intake.  Investigators  with  the
Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study reported that incident
diabetes was inversely associated with serum magnesium but not
with dietary magnesium intake (17).

The  associations  of  insoluble  fiber  and  cereal  fiber  intakes
with  diabetes  risk  were  consistent  with  the  analysis  of  food
groups  (Table  5), suggesting  that  whole-grain  cereals  were
more  strongly  inversely  related  to  disease  risk  than  were

refined  cereals.  Whole  and  refined  grains  contain  similar
amounts  of  carbohydrate, but  whole  grains  contain  substan-
tially more dietary fiber and magnesium (40). It is important to
note that what was included as whole grains herein may have
consisted largely of whole meal. It has been shown that parti-
cle  size  may  be  important  in  the  glycemic  response  (19)  and
thus  the  beneficial  effects  of  whole  grain  reported  here  may
have been more striking in a population that consumed grains
primarily in an intact form.

The glycemic index was devised to measure the effect of var-
ious foods on postprandial glycemic responses. Energy sources
that  are  slowly  absorbed  have  low  glycemic  indexes  and  have
been  shown  to  result  in  better  short-term  glycemic  control  in
clinical studies than energy sources with high glycemic indexes
(18). Two prospective studies showed positive relations between
the glycemic index and diabetes risk (11, 12). However, the pres-
ent analyses do not support a consistent, dose-response relation
between glycemic index and risk of type 2 diabetes. The RR esti-
mates  increased  through  the  third  quintile  of  intake  and  then
dropped in the fourth and fifth quintiles. The findings of positive
relations between both fructose and glucose and diabetes simi-
larly do not support the hypothesis of a positive relation between
the  glycemic  index  and  diabetes  risk.  Fructose  has  a  glycemic
index of 26 and glucose has a glycemic index of 138 when white
bread is used as the reference (18). However, in this study, both
the  high  correlation  (r = 0.94)  between  fructose  and  glucose
intake—which  makes  it  difficult  to  differentiate  their  associa-
tions with diabetes—and the typically poor measurement of sug-
ars hinders clear interpretation of these data.

DIETARY INTAKE AND DIABETES INCIDENCE

929

There  is  a  long-standing  debate  regarding  the  effect  of  sugar
intake, particularly sucrose, on diabetes risk. Clinical studies have
generally reported an effect of sucrose on postprandial glycemic
response similar to that of potatoes or white bread (18, 41). In non-
diabetic  subjects, increased  fructose  consumption  did  not  alter
fasting  or  postprandial  glucose  concentrations  in  one  study  (42)
and improved glycemic response in others (43). Among diabetic
subjects, improved glycemic response has generally been associ-
ated with increased consumption of fructose (43, 44).

Results  of  the  few  epidemiologic  studies  of  the  relation
between  sugars  and  diabetes  risk  are  inconsistent.  Cross-sec-
tional  studies  showed  both  similar  intakes  of  fructose  and
sucrose in subjects with and without diabetes (9) and decreased
intakes  of  refined  carbohydrates  in  those  with  compared  with
those without diabetes (8). A cross-sectional study of persons of
Japanese  descent  living  in  Hawaii  or  Japan  reported  a  positive
association between intake of sugars and prevalent diabetes (7).
Colditz  et  al  (10)  reported  no  association  of  sucrose  with  dia-
betes  incidence  in  either  lean  or  obese  women.  The  present
analysis suggests that, despite its high glycemic index, sucrose
does not increase the risk of diabetes.

We  found  no  evidence  for  an  effect  of  total  carbohydrate
intake  on  diabetes  risk, consistent  with  the  results  of  previous
cohort  studies.  Over  separate  follow-up  periods, investigators
with  the  Nurses’ Health  Study  twice  reported  no  association
between  intake  of  total  carbohydrate  and  risk  of  diabetes  (11,
12). Similarly, a study of 1462 Swedish women found no signi-
ficant differences between intakes of carbohydrates in those who
developed diabetes and those who did not over 12 y of follow-up
(13). Overall, these findings argue against an independent effect
of total carbohydrate intake in the etiology of diabetes.

Errors  in  the  measurement  of  dietary  intake, diabetes  inci-
dences, and  the  covariates  in  this  study  may  have  limited  our
ability  to  obtain  accurate  RR  estimates.  The  food-frequency
questionnaire was completed only once by study participants and
no effort was made to examine potential dietary changes over the
course  of  follow-up.  Also,
the  baseline  dietary  survey  was
assumed to represent the participants’ predisease diet. Although
data  were  not  available  to  examine  the  effects  of  inaccurate
dietary assessment, random measurement error in dietary expo-
sures  most  frequently  attenuates  risk  estimates  (45).  There
remains the potential for residual confounding by poorly meas-
ured covariates or by unmeasured differential changes in covari-
ates over the course of follow-up.

It was not feasible to measure glucose concentrations in the
study  participants;  incident  cases  of  diabetes  were  ascertained
by  self-report.  However, a  validation  study  in  this  cohort
showed low accuracy in the self-report of diabetes (26), consis-
tent with findings from one study in which 29 of 44 (66%) pos-
itive  reports  of  diabetes  were  validated  with  medical  records
(46). Several studies have provided evidence that nonvalidated
positive reports may nevertheless reflect some level of diabetes.
One  study  found  that  of  6  persons  with  nonvalidated  positive
reports  of  diabetes, 3  persons  had  renal  glycosuria  and  2  had
been diagnosed with glycosuria at some point in the past, but no
longer had glycosuria (47). This suggests that nondiabetic con-
centrations of blood glucose may not be entirely benign and that
women  who  falsely  reported  a  diagnosis  of  diabetes  may  still
have  had  some  level  of  underlying  disease, such  as  impaired
glucose  tolerance, which  had  been  mentioned  to  them  in  the
past. This  possibility  is  underscored  by  a  recent  change  in  the

diagnostic criteria for diabetes to include lower concentrations
of  fasting  glucose  (48).  Assuming  that  the  error  in  diabetes
ascertainment was independent and nondifferential, the present
findings  would  only  be  strengthened  by  more  accurate  ascer-
tainment of disease.

Data  from  this  prospective  study  of  older  women  support
inverse  associations  between  total  and  whole-grain  intake  and
risk of incident diabetes. These findings are consistent with those
of several other published studies of the health effects of whole
grains. Inverse associations were also observed for dietary fiber,
cereal fiber, and dietary magnesium intake. These findings sug-
gest a role for diet in the development of diabetes that is inde-
pendent of diet’s effect on body weight.

Main Outcome Measure.\p=m-\Non\p=m-\insulin-dependent
Results.\p=m-\During6 years of follow-up, 915 incident cases of diabetes were docu-
mented. The dietary glycemic index was positively associated with risk of diabetes
after adjustment for age, body mass index, smoking, physical activity, family history
of diabetes, alcohol and cereal fiber intake, and total energy intake. Comparing the
highest with the lowest quintile, the relative risk (RR) of diabetes was 1.37 (95% con-
fidence interval [CI], 1.09-1.71, Ptrend=.005). The glycemic load (an indicator of a
global dietary insulin demand) was also positively associated with diabetes
(RR=1.47; 95% CI, 1.16-1.86, Ptrend=.003). Cereal fiber intake was inversely as-
sociated with risk of diabetes when comparing the extreme quintiles (RR=0.72,95%
CI, 0.58-0.90, Ptrend=.001). The combination of a high glycemic load and a low
cereal fiber intake further increased the risk of diabetes (RR=2.50, 95% CI, 1.14\x=req-\
5.51) when compared with a low glycemic load and high cereal fiber intake.
results support the hypothesis that diets with a high glyce-
mic load and a low cereal fiber content increase risk of diabetes in women. Further,
they suggest that grains should be consumed in a minimally refined form to reduce
the incidence of diabetes.

diet or incomplete control for obesity and
other risk factors.
In an earlier analysis from the Nurses'
Health Study (1980-1986),15 we observed
that magnesium intake was inversely as¬
sociated with risk of NIDDM. In a recent
analysis of a 6-year follow-up period in a
parallel study among men,18 we found that
intakes of cereal fiber and magnesium
were inversely associated with risk of
NIDDM and that consumption of carbo¬
hydrates with a high glycémie index was
positively associated with risk ofNIDDM.
To address further the hypothesis that
diets leading to a high insulin demand
would influence the risk of NIDDM, we
examined prospectively the relationship
between specific dietary patterns and
risk of NIDDM in a cohort of 65173
women while controlling for the major
known risk factors for diabetes.

METHODS
Study Population

The Nurses' Health Study is a longi¬
tudinal study of diet and lifestyle factors
in relation to chronic diseases among
121700 US female registered nurses aged
30 to 55 years at enrollment. The cohort
was assembled in 1976 when the partici¬
pants returned a mailed questionnaire
about known and suspected risk factors
for cancer and cardiovascular disease.40
In 1980, we assessed diet with a 61-item
semiquantitative food frequency question¬
naire.41 In 1986, an expanded food fre¬
quency questionnaire (134 food items) was
mailed to cohort members. For the cur¬
rent analysis, we used information from
respondents to the 1986 questionnaire,
comprising 75 543 women aged 40 to 65
years; these data are thus independent of
our earlier report.15 We excluded partici¬
pants who did not satisfy the a priori cri¬
teria ofdaily energy intake between 2512
and 14654 kJ and those who left 10 or
more blanks amongthe 134 total food items
in the dietary questionnaire. In addition,
women who reported on the 1986 or a
previous questionnaire a diagnosis of dia¬
betes mellitus, cancer (except nonmela¬
noma skin cancer), myocardial infarction,
angina, stroke, and coronary artery sur¬
gery were also excluded, because they

NON-INSULIN-DEPENDENT diabe¬
tes mellitus (NIDDM) is characterized
by a decrease in the effect of insulin on
peripheral tissues (insulin resistance) and
by the inability ofthe endocrine pancreas
to compensate for this resistance (rela¬

as well as age and obesity,4"7 have been
described as the major risk factors for
insulin resistance and NIDDM. Never¬

the role of other potentially modifiable
factors such as physical activity,8·9 smok¬

hypothesis that dietary factors that in¬
crease insulin resistance or insulin de¬
mands would, over the long term, influ¬
ence the risk of NIDDM.1318
In animal studies, saturated fat in¬
take is directly related to insulin resis¬
tance19"23; however, inconsistent results
have been observed in clinical set¬
tings.24 In some clinical studies a benefi¬
cial effect of a high-fiber diet on insulin
demand in NIDDM subjects has been sug¬
gested.26"27 Also, results from metabolic
studies have suggested that carbohy¬
drates with a high glycémie index (a quali¬
tative indicatorof carbohydrate's ability
to raise blood glucose levels) increase in¬
sulin demand and accentuate hyperinsu-
linemia.28"35 Recent analysis on the long-
term effect of dietary patterns on insulin
levels suggest that animal fat may in¬
crease insulin levels, whereas dietary fi¬
ber may decrease them.15·16 However,
there are few prospective studies ad¬
dressing the association between diet and
risk of NIDDM,15·36"39 some of them with

diagnosis. One or more of the above rea¬
sons for exclusion were met by 10 370 par¬
ticipants, leaving 65173 eligible women
who were followed for NIDDM incidence
in the subsequent 6 years (1986-1992).
Dietary Assessment

To assess the participants' diets, a vali¬
dated semiquantitative food frequency
questionnaire containing 134 food items
and beverages as well as vitamin supple¬
ments was used in 1986. Nutrient scores
were computed by multiplying the fre¬
quency of consumption of each unit of
food derived from the food frequency
questionnaire by the nutrient content of
the specified portion size according to the
food composition tables from the US De¬
partment ofAgriculture.42 A full descrip¬
tion of the food frequency questionnaire
in its abbreviated form (61 items) and of
the procedures for calculation of nutrient
intake, as well as data on reproducibility
and validity in this cohort, have been pre¬
viously reported.41·43 Data on reproduc¬
ibility and validity of the 134-item food
frequency questionnaire used in a paral¬
lel study of men have been previously
reported (energy-adjusted mean daily in¬
take correlations between dietary records
and the food frequency questionnaire
were 0.75 for magnesium, 0.80 for satu¬
rated fat, 0.71 for monounsaturated fat,
0.44 for polyunsaturated fat, and 0.81 for
carbohydrates).44·46 The performance of
the food frequency questionnaire for as¬
sessing the individual foods from which
the glycémie index and load were derived
has been previously documented46; high
corrected correlation coefficients were ob¬
served for foods with high as well as low
glycémie index, for example, white bread,
0.71; dark bread, 0.77; potatoes, 0.66; cold
breakfast cereal, 0.79; cola beverages, 0.84;
apples, 0.80; orange juice, 0.84; yogurt,
0.94; broccoli, 0.69; and peanut butter, 0.75.
For each participant we derived an av¬
erage dietary glycémie index value. The
glycémie index is a quantitative assess¬
ment of foods based on the incremental
glucose response and insulin demand they
produce for a given amount of carbohy¬
drate.4648 As suggested by Wolever et al,49
we calculated the average dietary glycé¬
mie index for each participant by sum¬
ming the products of the carbohydrate
content per serving for each food times
the average number of servings of that
food per day, times its glycémie index, all
divided by the total amount of carbohy¬
drate daily intake. Following a similar
principle, but without dividing by the to¬
tal amount of carbohydrate, we also de¬
rived a score for the global dietary gly¬
cémie load as an indicator of a glucose
response or insulin demand induced by
the total carbohydrate intake. For these

calculations we used the published data
for glycémie index values,50"52 the carbo¬
hydrate content in each serving reported
by the US Department of Agriculture,41
and the average number of food servings
per day derived from the dietary ques¬
tionnaire. To control for total energy in¬
take, all nutrients as well as the glycémie
index and glycémie load variables were
adjusted for total energy using the re¬
siduals method.53
Measurement of Nondietary Factors
In 1982, the participants provided in¬
formation on history of diabetes in first-
degree relatives. In 1986 the participants
provided information on their weight and
smoking status. The validity of self-re¬
ported weight in this cohort has been re¬
ported previously (correlation coefficient
of 0.96 between self-reported and mea¬
sured weight).54 The level of physical ac¬
tivity in metabolic equivalents per week
was estimated based on self-reported du¬
ration per week of various forms of ex¬
ercise, weighting each activity by its in¬
tensity level.55
Follow-up and Ascertainment
of Cases

On follow-up questionnaires mailed ev¬
ery 2 years (in 1988, 1990, and 1992) we
inquired whether diabetes had been
newly diagnosed. When diabetes melli¬
tus was reported on a follow-up ques¬
tionnaire, we mailed the participant a
supplementary questionnaire to confirm
the report and to ascertain the date of
diagnosis, tests done to confirm the di¬
agnosis, presenting symptoms, and medi¬
cations. The diagnosis of NIDDM was
established whenever 1 or more of the
following criteria were met: (1) 1 or more
classic symptoms (thirst, polyuria, weight
loss, pruritus), plus a fasting plasma glu¬
cose concentration of 7.8 mmol/L (140
mg/dL) or higher or a random plasma
glucose concentration of 11.1 mmol/L (200
mg/dL) or higher; or (2) at least 2 el¬
evated plasma glucose concentrations on
different occasions (fasting >7.8 mmol/L
[140 mg/dL] and/or random >11.1 mmol/L
[200 mg/dL] and/or >11.1 mmol/L [200
mg/dL] after 2 hours or more on oral
glucose tolerance testing) in the absence
of symptoms; or (3) treatment with hy¬
poglycémie medication (insulin or oral hy¬
poglycémie agents). These criteria cor¬
respond to those proposed by the
National Diabetes Data Group66 and the
World Health Organization.57 We ex¬
cluded women with insulin-dependent
(type I) diabetes, as well as women clas¬
sified as having gestational diabetes only
(diabetes first diagnosed during preg¬
nancy, persisting no more than 1 month
after the end ofpregnancy). The validity
of self-reported diabetes in this cohort

using the supplementary questionnaire
has been previously documented.5
Statistical Analysis

For each participant, person-months of
follow-up were counted from the date of
return of the 1986 questionnaire to the
date ofdiabetes diagnosis, to date ofdeath,
or to June 1,1992, whichever came first.
Person-months of follow-up were calcu¬
lated according to the exposure status in
1986, for example, by level of nutrient
intake. Incidence rates were calculated as
the number of events divided by the per¬
son-time offollow-up. Relative risks (RRs)
(incidence-rate ratios) were calculated by
dividing the incidence rate of NIDDM in
a particular category of exposure by the
corresponding rate in the reference cat¬
egory.58 The Mantel extension test59 was
calculated to assess the linear trend with
increasing exposure levels. In multivari¬
ate logistic models, we tested for signifi¬
cant monotonie trend by assigning each
participant the median value for the cat¬
egory and modeling this value as a con¬
tinuous variable. All   values are 2-sided.
Relative risks were simultaneously ad¬
justed for other variables by means of
logistic regression analysis.60 The basic
model
included terms for age in 5-year
categories and other variables that pre¬
dict NIDDM in this cohort study,6·12 spe¬
cifically body mass index (weight in kilo¬
grams divided by the square ofthe height
in meters, using 9 categories), smoking
status (current smoker classified accord¬
ing to the number of cigarettes smoked
per day, former smoker, or never smoker),
alcohol consumption (7 categories), physi¬
cal activity (quintile groups of metabolic
equivalents), and history of diabetes in a
first-degree relative (yes or no). All analy¬
ses reported in this article use this basic
model, unless stated otherwise.
RESULTS

Among the baseline population of65173
women, the dietary glycémie index was
positively associated with carbohydrate
and cereal fiber intake and negatively
associated with consumption of magne¬
sium, alcohol, and animal fat (Table 1).
The glycémie index was also positively
related to the frequency of intake of the
foods contributing most to carbohydrate
variation intake in our cohort (Table 1). A
similar pattern of association was ob¬
served with the glycémie load score.
We documented 915 incident cases of
NIDDM during a 6-year follow-up period
(1986-1992). Total energy intake was
weakly and positively related to risk of
NIDDM after adjustment for age, obe¬
sity, alcohol consumption, smoking, physi¬
cal activity, and family history, although
the test for trend was not statistically
significant (Table 2). Animal fat intake

was inversely associated with risk of
NIDDM, whereas fruit and vegetable fi¬
ber were not clearly related to risk (Table
3). Magnesium, calcium, and potassium
were inversely related to risk ofNIDDM,
but only for magnesium was the trend
significant (Table 3). The inverse asso¬
ciation withmagnesium remained signifi¬
cant after further adjustment for cereal
fiber intake and glycémie load.
Although total carbohydrate intake was
not related to risk of NIDDM, both the
glycémie index as well as the glycémie
load score were positively associated with
risk. However, the glycémie load score
became significant only after adjustment
for cereal fiber intake (Table 4).
We examined thejoint effect ofthe gly¬
cémie load and the cereal fiber intake by
cross classifying participants by both vari¬
ables. The RR for the combination of a
high glycémie load and a low cereal fiber
intake compared with the opposite ex¬
treme was 2.50 (confidence interval [CI],
1.14-5.51) (Figure).
We also examined the relation to risk
of NIDDM of the 20 foods contributing
most to variation of carbohydrate con¬
sumption within this cohort. We observed
significant inverse associations with cold
breakfast cereal and yogurt, and signifi
cant positive associations with cola bev¬
erages, white bread, white rice, french
fried potatoes, and cooked potatoes.
In the main results we further included
in the basic model waist-hip ratio as a
covariate; however, the results did not
change after controlling for waist-hip ra¬
tio. We also repeated our analysis adjust¬
ing for updated values from the biennial

COMMENT

In this large-scale prospective study,
we observed that diets with high glycé¬
mie load and low cereal fiber content were
positively associated with risk ofNIDDM,
independent of other dietary factors and
currently known risk factors. The pro¬
spective design of this study avoids the
possibility of biased recall of diet because
all data on food intake were collected be¬
fore the diagnosis ofNIDDM. Incomplete
follow-up is unlikely to distort these re¬
sults since the follow-up rate was over
90% and similar for each level of baseline
of the dietary variables. We considered
the possibility that a diagnostic bias

might account for the observed relation¬
ship between dietary intake patterns and
risk of NIDDM. It could be possible that
women with unhealthy diets may be more
likely to have screening tests for diabe¬
the proportion of cases
tes. However,
without reported symptoms at diagnosis
did not vary appreciably by level of gly¬
cémie load score, magnesium or dietary
fiber intake, nor did the frequency ofphy¬
sician visits within the first 2 years of
follow-up. Further, when only cases who
were symptomatic at diagnosis were con¬
sidered, the association with glycémie load
was even stronger than for all cases of
NIDDM.
Previous prospective studies as well
as the current analysis have consis¬
tently found little relationship between
total carbohydrate intake and risk of

NIDDM.16·18·36"39 Using total carbohy¬
drate intake, however, does not take
into account the glycémie effect or in¬
sulin demand of various forms of car¬
bohydrates. Metabolic studies have docu¬
mented differences in insulin demand
generated by various foods containing the
same amount of carbohydrate,48 depend¬
ing largely on the type or degree of di¬
gestibility of the starch content. Foods
with a higher carbohydrate digestibility
generate a higher insulin demand.46·51 The
carbohydrates in starchy foods with a low
glycémie index have been called lente car¬
bohydrates,61·62 which are mainly from less
processed grain products that maintain
their original fiber content. Some repre¬
sentative values for food with low and
high glycémie index are white bread, 100;
dark bread, 58-70; mashed potatoes, 104;

als. Our results suggest that magnesium
may be an independent predictor of
NIDDM. The inverse relationship be¬
tween dietary magnesium intake and risk
ofNIDDM we observed is consistent with
our results of an earlier analysis in the
Nurses' Health Study15 and a parallel
study in men.18 However, in neither of
these studies did we observe a consistent
relationship between magnesium and
NIDDM among the different food sources
of magnesium, as would be expected for
a true causal relationship. The high cor¬
relation between cereal fiber and mag¬
nesium may not permit a clear separation
of the independent effect of magnesium
from that of cereal fiber intake.
Most prospective studies exploring the
relation between diet and NIDDM have
not found a positive association between
total fat intake and incidence of NIDDM.
Our findings in the first 6-year follow-up
period in the Nurses' Health Study15 and
in a parallel study in men18 are consistent
with our current results, suggesting that
overall fat intake is not associated with
risk of NIDDM.

Beyond the well-known risk factors for
NIDDM of age, obesity, family history,
sedentary lifestyle, and smoking, our find¬
ings support the hypothesis that a diet
with high glycémie load and a low cereal
fiber content increases risk of NIDDM.
These findings suggest that grains should
be consumed in a minimally refined form
to reduce the incidence of diabetes.

This study was supported by National Institutes
of Health grants DK36798 and CA40356 and by the
Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social.

Nurses' Health Study for their continuing coop¬
eration; to David Jenkins, MD, PhD, for assistance

type), 72-127; cola beverages, 87; apples,
65; orange juice, 65; yogurt, 35; broccoli,
45; and peanut butter, 40.50"52 To evaluate
the relationship between carbohydrate
intake and risk of NIDDM, it therefore
seems critical to examine the quality as
well as the quantity ofcarbohydrates con¬
sumed. The glycémie index, as a relative
measure of glycémie response to a given
amount of carbohydrate, does represent
the quality of carbohydrate but does not
take into account the quantity. In con¬
trast, the total glycémie load represents
the combination of quality as well as the
quantity of carbohydrate consumed, and
may be interpreted as a measure of di¬
etary insulin demand.
An extensive literature has addressed
the link between consumption of fiber-
depleted diets and the occurrence of sev¬
eral chronic diseases, including NIDDM.63
In some metabolic studies amongpatients
with NIDDM, high-fiber diets have de¬
creased insulin demand.2527 It has also
been suggested that the type of fiber
could be differentially related to risk of
NIDDM,18·64 and that the amount of di¬
etary fiber consumed may modify the in¬
sulin demand that different foods gener¬
ate; starchy foods mixed with viscous
soluble fibers (guar gums) present lower
glycémie responses than when eaten with¬
out it.65·66 However, there are sparse epi¬
demiologie data on the relationship be¬
tween different types of dietary fiber
intake and the incidence of NIDDM, and
on the potential interactions with other
dietary factors. In our current analysis,
we found that total dietary fiber was in¬
versely related with risk of NIDDM, but

fiber from cereals had an especially strong
inverse independent relationship to risk
of NIDDM. Our results also suggest a
particularly adverse effect of high glycé¬
mie load in combination with a low cereal
fiber intake; the RR observed for this
combination (RR=2.50) was more than
2-fold greater relative to consumption of
a diet high in cereal fiber and low in gly¬
cémie load. A similar pattern was ob¬
served in a parallel cohort of men.18
Hyperinsulinemia, a manifestation of
insulin resistance, is 1 of the best predic¬
tors ofNIDDM6770 and populations at high
risk of NIDDM have higher insulin lev¬
els.67 Diets with a high glycémie index
increase insulin demand and hyperinsu¬
linemia amongpatients with NIDDM,28"32
as well as in normal subjects.33 Therefore,
diets with a high glycémie load as well as
low cereal fiber content are likely to lead
to a chronic high demand forinsulin, which
may be exacerbated by insulin resistance.
As long as the pancreas is able to aug¬
ment insulin secretion to meet the extra
demand, glucose tolerance remains nor¬
mal. But ifthe endocrine pancreas fails to
respond adequately (relative insulin de¬
ficiency), glucose intolerance ensues, lead¬
ing to NIDDM.71"75 Why pancreatic "ex¬
haustion" occurs is not clear, but it may
be related to the effect ofglucose toxicity
in a genetically predisposed beta cell; in
early stages, however, this pancreatic de¬
ficiency may be reversible.76"77
Metabolic studies suggest an inverse
association between intracellular magne¬
sium and insulin resistance.78·79 Also, a

tation on insulin sensitivity in patients

Abstract Several studies have suggested a protective
effect of intake of whole grains, but not reﬁned grains on
type 2 diabetes risk, but the dose–response relationship
between different types of grains and type 2 diabetes has
not been established. We conducted a systematic review
and meta-analysis of prospective studies of grain intake
and type 2 diabetes. We searched the PubMed database for
studies of grain intake and risk of type 2 diabetes, up to
June 5th, 2013. Summary relative risks were calculated
using a random effects model. Sixteen cohort studies were
included in the analyses. The summary relative risk per 3
servings per day was 0.68 (95 % CI 0.58–0.81, I2 = 82 %,
n = 10) for whole grains and 0.95 (95 % CI 0.88–1.04,
I2 = 53 %, n = 6) for reﬁned grains. A nonlinear associ-
ation was observed for whole grains, pnonlinearity \ 0.0001,
but not
Inverse
associations were observed for subtypes of whole grains
including whole grain bread, whole grain cereals, wheat
bran and brown rice, but these results were based on few
studies, while white rice was associated with increased
risk. Our meta-analysis suggests that a high whole grain
intake, but not reﬁned grains, is associated with reduced

reﬁned grains, pnonlinearity = 0.10.

type 2 diabetes risk. However, a positive association with
intake of white rice and inverse associations between
several speciﬁc types of whole grains and type 2 diabetes
warrant further investigations. Our results support public
health recommendations to replace reﬁned grains with
whole grains and suggest that at least two servings of
whole grains per day should be consumed to reduce type 2
diabetes risk.

Introduction

The prevalence of diabetes type 2 is rapidly increasing
worldwide, with an estimated 311 million persons living
with diabetes in 2011 and this number is expected to
increase to 552 million by 2030 [1]. Diabetes patients have
increased risk cardiovascular disease, some cancers, eye
and kidney disease [2]. Total medical costs of diabetes
were estimated at US$245 billion in 2012 in the US [3].

Changes in body weight and physical activity are likely
to contribute to these increased rates [4], but diet may also
inﬂuence diabetes risk, directly and indirectly through an
effect on obesity. Whole grains contain endosperm, germ,
and bran, in contrast to reﬁned grains which have the germ
and bran removed during the milling process. Whole grains
have been hypothesized to reduce the risk of type 2 dia-
betes based on their content of ﬁber, vitamins and minerals
and phytochemicals which may improve insulin sensitivity
and glucose metabolism, and by reducing overweight and
obesity [5]. In contrast, reﬁned grains may increase risk
because of their high glycemic index or glycemic load and
reduced ﬁber and nutrient content. Several studies of whole

123

grain intake in relation to type 2 diabetes risk have reported
inverse associations with higher intake [5–10], but some
found no signiﬁcant association [11, 12]. Inverse associa-
tions have been reported with intake of speciﬁc whole grain
products as well, including brown bread [13–15], whole
grain breakfast cereals [13, 16] and brown rice [7],
although the results are not entirely consistent [17, 18]. In
contrast, most studies of reﬁned grain intake have shown
no association overall [5, 12, 13, 19], although two sug-
gested inverse associations [8, 10], while high intake of
white bread [17] or white rice [7, 20, 21] has been asso-
ciated with increased risk, although not consistently
[17, 22]. Although two previous meta-analyses have been
conducted on whole grains and type 2 diabetes [23, 24], the
optimal intake of whole grains for prevention of type 2
diabetes is not established because the shape of the dose–
response relationship has not been investigated. In addi-
tion, there is increasing evidence suggesting that whole
grains reduces the risk of overweight and obesity and
weight gain [24–30], thus it is possible that body mass
index may be an intermediate factor more than a con-
founder, but it is not known how much of the association
that may be explained by reduced body fatness. We con-
ducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the evi-
dence from prospective studies with the aim of clarifying
(1) the association between the intake of grains and dif-
ferent types of grains and type 2 diabetes risk, (2) the dose–
response relationship between intake of grains and speciﬁc
types of grains and type 2 diabetes risk, and (3) how much
of the association that may be explained by reduced body
fatness.

Methods

Search strategy

We conducted a comprehensive search in the PubMed
database up to June 5th, 2013 for studies of various food
groups and type 2 diabetes risk. The search terms relevant
to this analysis included ‘‘cereal OR breakfast cereal OR
grain OR whole grain OR rice OR bread’’ AND ‘‘diabe-
tes’’. The full search is provided in the Supplementary
Appendix. We also searched the reference lists of all the
studies that were included in the analysis and the reference
lists of published meta-analyses [23, 24].

Study selection

To be included, the study had to have a prospective design
and to investigate the association between the intake of
grains and type 2 diabetes risk. Estimates of the relative
risk (hazard ratio, risk ratio) had to be available with the

123

95 % conﬁdence intervals in the publication and for the
dose–response analysis, a quantitative measure of intake
and the total number of cases and person-years had to be
available in the publication. We identiﬁed 28 publications
that reported on intake of grains in relation to diabetes
[5–23, 31–39]. Three publications were excluded because
no risk estimates were provided [35, 36, 39], two publi-
cations were excluded because they were cross-sectional
studies [37, 38] and four because they were duplicates
[31–34]. One publication [23] was included only in the
sensitivity analysis with and without adjustment for BMI
because the most recent publication [7] from these two
studies did not provide results both adjusted and unadjusted
for BMI. In addition several publications from the same
studies reported on different grain items and all were
included in the analyses, but each study was only included
once in the analysis of the relevant grain variable.

Data extraction

We extracted the following data from each study: The ﬁrst
author’s last name, publication year, country where the
study was conducted, the study name, follow-up period,
sample size, gender, age, number of cases, dietary assess-
ment method (type, number of food items and whether it
had been validated), exposure, quantity of intake, RRs and
95 % CIs for the highest versus the lowest grain intake and
variables adjusted for in the analysis.

Statistical methods

To take into account within and between studies hetero-
geneity we used random effects models to estimate sum-
mary RRs and 95 % CIs for the highest versus the lowest
level of grain intake and for the dose–response analysis
[40]. The average of the natural logarithm of the RRs was
estimated and the RR from each study was weighted by the
inverse of its variance. A two-tailed p \ 0.05 was con-
sidered statistically signiﬁcant.

We used the method described by Greenland and
Longnecker [41] for the dose–response analysis and com-
puted study-speciﬁc slopes (linear trends) and 95 % CIs
from the natural logs of the RRs and CIs across categories
of grain intake. The method requires that the distribution of
cases and person-years or non-cases and the RRs with the
variance estimates for at least three quantitative exposure
categories are known. We estimated the distribution of
cases or person-years in studies that did not report these,
but reported the total number of cases/person-years [42].
The median or mean level of grain intake in each category
of intake was assigned to the corresponding relative risk for
each study. For studies that reported grain intake by ranges
of intake we estimated the midpoint for each category by

Whole grain and reﬁned grain consumption

847

calculating the average of the lower and upper bound.
When the highest or lowest category was open-ended we
assumed the open-ended interval length to be the same as
the adjacent interval. In studies that reported the intakes in
grams per day we used 30 g as a serving size for recal-
culation of the intakes to a common scale (servings per
day) [43]. We used 158 g as a serving size for intake of
white rice and brown rice consistent with a recent study
[44]. The dose–response results in the forest plots are
presented for a 3 serving per day increment [43]. We
examined a potential nonlinear dose–response relationship
between grain intake and type 2 diabetes by using frac-
tional polynomial models [45]. We determined the best
ﬁtting second order
regression
model, deﬁned as the one with the lowest deviance. A
likelihood ratio test was used to assess the difference
between the nonlinear and linear models to test for non-
linearity [46]. The intake in the reference category was
subtracted from the intake in each category for the linear
dose–response analysis, but not for the nonlinear dose–
response analysis.

fractional polynomial

Heterogeneity between studies was assessed by the Q
test and I2 [47]. I2 is the amount of total variation that is
I2 values of
explained by between study variation.
approximately 25, 50 and 75 % are considered to indicate
low, moderate and high heterogeneity, respectively.

Publication bias was assessed with Egger’s test [48] and
Begg’s test [49] with the results considered to indicate
publication bias when p \ 0.10. We conducted sensitivity
analyses excluding one study at a time to ensure that the
results were not simply due to one large study or a study
with an extreme result, when there were at least 5 studies in
the analysis. The statistical analyses were conducted using
Stata, version 10.1 software (StataCorp, College Station,
TX, USA).

Results

We identiﬁed sixteen cohort studies (nineteen publications)
that were included in the analyses of grain intake and type
2 diabetes risk [5–23] (Table 1; Fig. 1). Seven studies were
from the US, six were from Europe, two from Asia and one
was from Australia (Table 1).

Whole grains

Ten cohort studies (8 publications) [5–12] were included in
the analysis of total whole grain intake and type 2 diabetes
risk and included 19,829 cases among 385,868 participants.
One of the studies only reported a continuous result and
was not included in the high versus low analysis [11]. The
summary RR for high versus low intake was 0.74 (95 % CI

(95 % CI

0.58–0.81,

I2 = 82 %,

0.71–0.78, I2 = 0 %, pheterogeneity = 0.43) (Supplementary
Figure 1). The summary RR per 3 servings per day was
pheterogene-
0.68
ity \ 0.0001) (Fig. 2a). The summary RR ranged from 0.65
(95 % CI 0.56–0.77) when excluding the EPIC-Potsdam
study to 0.72 (95 % CI 0.63–0.83) when excluding the
Nurses’ Health Study 1. There was no evidence of small
study bias with Egger’s test, p = 0.49 or with Begg’s test,
p = 0.37. There was evidence of a nonlinear association
between whole grain intake and type 2 diabetes risk,
pnonlinearity \ 0.0001, with a steeper reduction in risk when
increasing intake from low levels and most of the beneﬁt
was observed up to an intake of two servings per day
(Fig. 2b, Supplementary Table 1).

Reﬁned grains

Six studies [5, 8, 12, 13, 19] reported on reﬁned grain
intake and type 2 diabetes and included 9,545 cases among
258,078 participants. The summary RR for high versus low
intake of reﬁned grains was 0.94 (95 % CI 0.82–1.09,
I2 = 64 %, pheterogeneity = 0.02) (Supplementary Figure 2).
The summary RR per 3 servings per day was 0.95 (95 % CI
0.88–1.04, I2 = 53 %, pheterogeneity = 0.06) (Fig. 3a). The
summary RR ranged from 0.93 (95 % CI 0.86–1.00) when
the Nurses’ Health Study 1 was excluded to 0.98 (95 % CI
0.90–1.08) when the Women’s Health Initiative was
excluded. There was no evidence of small study bias with

was no evidence of a nonlinear association between reﬁned
grain intake and type 2 diabetes risk, pnonlinearity = 0.10
(Fig. 3b, Supplementary Table 2).

Total grains and subtypes of grains

Fewer studies had reported on total grains and subtypes of
grains. The summary RR for high versus low total grain
intake was 0.74 (95 % CI 0.58–0.93) [5, 8, 13, 17] with
I2 = 60 %, pheterogeneity = 0.06
moderate heterogeneity,
(Supplementary Figure 3). The summary RR per 3 servings
per day was 0.83 (95 % CI 0.75–0.91, I2 = 36 %, phetero-
geneity = 0.19) (Supplementary Figure 4a). There was evi-
dence of a nonlinear association between total grain intake
and type 2 diabetes, pnonlinearity = 0.001, and the reduction
in risk was steeper at the lower and higher end of the
intake, with a slight ﬂattening at
intermediate intakes
(Supplementary Figure 4b, Supplementary Table 3). The

I2 = 50 %, pheterogeneity = 0.11, n = 4)

summary RR for high versus low intake was 0.82 (95 % CI
0.72–0.94,
for
whole grain bread [5, 13, 14, 17], 0.66 (95 % CI 0.57–0.77,
I2 = 35 %, pheterogeneity = 0.21, n = 3) for whole grain
cereals [5, 13, 16], 0.76 (95 % CI 0.69–0.84, I2 = 30 %,
pheterogeneity = 0.24, n = 3) for wheat bran [7], 0.97 (95 %
CI 0.86–1.10, I2 = 59 %, pheterogeneity = 0.09, n = 3) for
wheat germ [7], 0.89 (95 % CI: 0.81–0.97, I2 = 0 %,
pheterogeneity = 0.40, n = 3) for brown rice [7], 1.17 (95 %
CI: 0.93–1.47, I2 = 78 %, pheterogeneity \ 0.0001, n = 7)
for white rice [7, 17, 20–22], and 0.82 (95 % CI 0.56–1.18,
n = 2) for total cereals [16, 17] (Table 2). Nonlinear
associations were observed for whole grain bread, pnonlin-
earity = 0.01, whole grain cereals, pnonlinearity \ 0.0001,
wheat bran, pnonlinearity = 0.007, and brown rice, pnonlinear-
ity = 0.02, and consistent with the analysis of overall
whole grain intake, the reduction in risk was steepest when
increasing the intake from low levels (Supplementary
Figure 5a-d). We were not able to ﬁt a nonlinear curve for

Subgroup and sensitivity analyses

There was no signiﬁcant heterogeneity between subgroups
in analyses of whole grains and type 2 diabetes stratiﬁed by
gender, duration of follow-up, geographic area, number of
cases and adjustment for confounding factors and inverse
associations were apparent in most subgroups, although
they were not always statistically signiﬁcant (Table 3).
Although the test for heterogeneity was not signiﬁcant,
pheterogeneity = 0.15, the association appeared to be slightly
stronger in the American studies than among the European
studies.

Because BMI may be an intermediate variable we also
restricted the analysis to the ﬁve studies (four publications)
that had presented risk estimates both adjusted and not
adjusted for BMI [10, 12, 19, 23]. The summary RR per 3
servings per day increase in whole grain intake was 0.69
I2 = 58 %, pheterogeneity = 0.05) with BMI
(0.60–0.80,
adjustment (and this was similar to the result from the main
analysis) and 0.53 (95 % CI 0.41–0.69, I2 = 88 %, pheter-
ogeneity \ 0.001) without BMI adjustment (Fig. 4a) and
there were similar differences in the results by BMI
adjustment in the nonlinear analysis (Fig. 4b).

Discussion

Our meta-analysis supports the hypothesis that a high
whole grain and total grain intake protects against type 2
diabetes with a 32 and 17 % reduction in the relative risk
per 3 servings per day, but we found no association
between overall reﬁned grain intake and type 2 diabetes
risk. There was evidence of a nonlinear inverse association
between whole grains and total grains and type 2 diabetes
with most of the reduction observed when increasing the
intake up to 2 servings per day for whole grain intake,
while for total grains there was also a steep reduction in
relative risk when increasing intake from low levels,

123

followed by a slight ﬂattening of the curve with interme-
diate intakes and a steeper reduction at higher intakes.
However,
the inverse association with high total grain
intake should be interpreted with caution as it was based on
relatively few studies, and is likely to be driven by higher
whole grain intake since there was no association with
overall reﬁned grain intake. A positive association was
observed with intake of white rice. In addition, we found
that several subtypes of whole grains including whole grain
cereals, brown bread and brown rice were associated with
reduced risk, but these analyses were based on few studies
and need further conﬁrmation.

Our meta-analysis has limitations which affect

the
interpretation of the results. The main limitation is the low
number of cohort studies available apart from the total
whole grain analysis. Further studies are therefore needed
before ﬁrm conclusions can be made for the remaining
exposures. Although it is possible that the inverse associ-
ation between whole grain intake and type 2 diabetes could
be due to unmeasured or residual confounding by other
lifestyle factors we found that the association persisted in
several subgroup analyses where such factors had been
adjusted for. There was high heterogeneity in the dose–
response analysis of whole grains and type 2 diabetes,
although not in the comparison of the highest versus the
lowest
intake. There was less heterogeneity in studies
conducted among men than among women, but there was
no signiﬁcant heterogeneity between these subgroups, or
when stratiﬁed by number of cases, duration of follow-up
or adjustment for confounding factors. A slightly stronger
association was observed in the American studies than
among the European studies, but there was also no sig-
niﬁcant heterogeneity by geographic location, suggesting
that this ﬁnding could be due to chance. Because of the low
number of studies our ability to test for publication bias
may have been limited, however, there was no indication of
asymmetry in the funnel plots. In addition, because of the
low number of studies with very high intakes of whole
grains and total grains, the results in the high ranges ([3
servings for whole grains, and[7 servings for total grains)
were based on relatively few datapoints and should be

interpreted with caution. Measurement errors in the expo-
sure assessment are known to bias effect estimates, but
because we only included prospective cohort studies such
measurement errors are most likely to have resulted in
attenuation of the association between whole grain intake
and type 2 diabetes risk. None of the studies published to
date have corrected their results for measurement error.
The deﬁnition of whole grains differed in some of the

studies (Supplementary Table 4) with several American
studies considering breakfast cereals to be made of whole
grains if the product contained C25 % whole grain or bran
by weight [5, 7, 13, 19, 23], while one Swedish study used
C50 % as a cut-off point [9]. Several other studies did not
state how whole grains were deﬁned, thus it is difﬁcult to
assess whether the differing deﬁnitions might have inﬂu-
enced the results. Further studies using biomarkers of

whole grain intake could be useful to assess the impact of
measurement errors in the dietary assessment [50] and any
further studies on dietary whole grain intake should report
the deﬁnition of whole grain foods used in the analysis for
comparison between studies.

A protective effect of whole grain consumption against
type 2 diabetes is biologically plausible and several mech-
anisms may operate to reduce the risk. Several studies have
reported inverse associations between whole grain intake
and prospective weight gain [25–30] and we found that the
size of the association between whole grains and type 2
diabetes was about 1/3 stronger when the analyses were not
adjusted for BMI compared with adjustment for BMI
(RR = 0.53 vs. 0.69, respectively) [10, 12, 19, 23]. Thus,
reduced body fatness may explain part, but not all of the
protective effect of whole grains against type 2 diabetes risk.

123

D. Aune et al.

The results of the nonlinear analysis stratiﬁed by adjustment
for BMI suggest that reduced body fatness may explain a
larger part of the association at higher levels compared with
lower levels of whole grain intake as the association
appeared to have a more linear shape in analyses without
adjustment for BMI than when adjusted for BMI. Whole
grains are an important source of cereal ﬁber, phytochemi-
cals, vitamins and minerals. High whole grain intake has
been associated with greater insulin sensitivity and lower
fasting insulin concentration and this was observed for dark
breads, and in particular high-ﬁber cereals [51]. Intake of
cereal ﬁber, but not fruit or vegetable ﬁber, has been asso-
ciated with reduced type 2 diabetes risk in a meta-analysis of
prospective studies [14]. Greater intake of soluble ﬁber
reduces the rate of gastric emptying and leads to a slower
blood glucose and insulin response [52–54]. However,
whole grains contain more insoluble ﬁber,
thus other
mechanisms are probably involved than just the latter.
Intake of rye bread has been shown to result in a lower
postprandial insulin response and this was found to be
independent of its ﬁber content [55]. In addition, high intake
of whole grains may reduce risk of type 2 diabetes by
reducing concentrations of inﬂammatory markers including
plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 and C-reactive pro-
tein [56–60] and liver enzymes including gamma-gluta-
myltransferase and aspartate aminotransferase [56], as
higher concentrations of these proteins may increase type 2
diabetes risk [61–63]. In addition, a high intake of whole
grains and cereal ﬁber has been associated with greater
blood concentrations of adiponectin [57, 64], a cytokine that
increases insulin sensitivity and reduces inﬂammation [65].
Further studies are needed to explore potential mechanisms
that could explain the nonlinear associations observed.

Our meta-analysis also has several strengths. Because
we based our analysis on prospective cohort studies recall
bias is not likely to explain our ﬁndings, and the possibility
for selection bias is reduced. Although the number of
studies was moderate they included up to 19,800 cases and
385,000 participants and we therefore had adequate sta-
tistical power to detect moderate associations. We con-
ducted several subgroup analyses and observed that the
inverse association persisted in most subgroup analyses,
and the ﬁndings were also robust in sensitivity analyses
where each study was excluded one at a time. We quan-
tiﬁed the association between grain intake and type 2 dia-
betes by conducting linear and nonlinear dose–response
analyses and found that most of the beneﬁt of whole grains
on type 2 diabetes risk is observed with an intake of at least
2 servings per day (60 g/day). However, if whole grains
reduce body fatness and body mass index is a mediating
factor, further reductions in the risk may be observed with
higher intakes. Increasing whole grain intakes is also likely
to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease [66],

Whole grain and reﬁned grain consumption

overweight and obesity [24–30] and colorectal cancer [43],
and it is possible that there are greater beneﬁts for these
outcomes with even higher intakes.

In summary, our meta-analysis suggests that a high intake
of whole grains, but not reﬁned grains, is associated with
reduced type 2 diabetes risk. However, a positive association
with intake of white rice and inverse associations between
several speciﬁc types of whole grains and type 2 diabetes
warrant further investigations. Our results support public
health recommendations to replace reﬁned grains with whole
grains and suggest that at least two servings of whole grains
per day should be consumed to reduce type 2 diabetes risk.

TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS AF-

fects about 17 million US in-
dividuals.1-3 The prevalence of
diabetes has increased rapidly
during the last decades2,4,5 in parallel to
the obesity epidemic.2,5 Coinciding with
the increasing prevalence of obesity and
type 2 diabetes, soft drink consump-
tion in the United States increased by
61% in adults from 1977 to 19976 and
more than doubled in children and
adolescents from 1977-1978 to 1994-
1998.7 Recent evidence suggests an as-
sociation between the intake of sugar-
sweetened soft drinks and the risk of
obesity in children,8 but data among
adults are limited. Besides contribut-
ing to obesity, sugar-sweetened soft
drinks might increase risk of diabetes
because they contain large amounts of
high-fructose corn syrup, which raises
blood glucose similarly to sucrose.9 Soft
drinks are the leading source of added
sugars in the US diet,10 and each serv-
ing represents a considerable amount
of glycemic load that may increase risk
of diabetes.11 In addition, cola-based soft

Context Sugar-sweetened beverages like soft drinks and fruit punches contain large
amounts of readily absorbable sugars and may contribute to weight gain and an in-
creased risk of type 2 diabetes, but these relationships have been minimally addressed
in adults.
Objective To examine the association between consumption of sugar-sweetened
beverages and weight change and risk of type 2 diabetes in women.
Design, Setting, and Participants Prospective cohort analyses conducted from
1991 to 1999 among women in the Nurses’ Health Study II. The diabetes analysis in-
cluded 91249 women free of diabetes and other major chronic diseases at baseline in
1991. The weight change analysis included 51603 women for whom complete di-
etary information and body weight were ascertained in 1991, 1995, and 1999. We
identified 741 incident cases of confirmed type 2 diabetes during 716300 person-
years of follow-up.
Main Outcome Measures Weight gain and incidence of type 2 diabetes.
Results Those with stable consumption patterns had no difference in weight gain,
but weight gain over a 4-year period was highest among women who increased their
sugar-sweetened soft drink consumption from 1 or fewer drinks per week to 1 or more
drinks per day (multivariate-adjusted means, 4.69 kg for 1991 to 1995 and 4.20 kg
for 1995 to 1999) and was smallest among women who decreased their intake (1.34
and 0.15 kg for the 2 periods, respectively) after adjusting for lifestyle and dietary con-
founders. Increased consumption of fruit punch was also associated with greater weight
gain compared with decreased consumption. After adjustment for potential confound-
ers, women consuming 1 or more sugar-sweetened soft drinks per day had a relative
risk [RR] of type 2 diabetes of 1.83 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.42-2.36; P⬍.001
for trend) compared with those who consumed less than 1 of these beverages per
month. Similarly, consumption of fruit punch was associated with increased diabetes
risk (RR for ⱖ1 drink per day compared with ⬍1 drink per month, 2.00; 95% CI, 1.33-
3.03; P=.001).
Conclusion Higher consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages is associated with
a greater magnitude of weight gain and an increased risk for development of type 2
diabetes in women, possibly by providing excessive calories and large amounts of rap-
idly absorbable sugars.

drinks contain caramel coloring, which
is rich in advanced glycation end prod-
ucts that might increase insulin resis-
tance12 and inflammation.13 However,
no study has examined the associa-
tion between the consumption of soft
drinks and other sugar-sweetened bev-
erages and risk of type 2 diabetes. We
therefore examined the relationships
between sugar-sweetened beverage con-
sumption and weight gain and diabe-
tes risk in a large cohort of young and
middle-aged women, controlling for po-
tential confounding factors. Because the
majority of sugar-sweetened bever-
ages consumed in this cohort are soft
drinks, we particularly emphasized soft
drink consumption.

METHODS
Study Population
The Nurses’ Health Study II is a pro-
spective cohort study of 116 671 fe-
male US nurses aged 24 to 44 years at
study initiation in 1989. This cohort is
followed up using biennial mailed ques-
tionnaires, with a follow-up rate ex-
ceeding 90% for every 2-year period.
For the analyses presented here, women
were excluded if they did not com-
plete a dietary questionnaire in 1991 or
if more than 9 items on it were left
blank; if the reported dietary intake was
implausible with regard to total en-
ergy intake (ie, ⬍500 kcal/d or ⬎3500
kcal/d); if they had a history of diabe-
tes, cancer (except nonmelanoma skin
cancer), or cardiovascular disease at
baseline; or if they had not provided
data on physical activity in 1991. The
final sample for the diabetes analysis
consisted of 91 249 women. For the
analysis on weight change, we also ex-
cluded women who did not complete
questions on sugar-sweetened soft drink
consumption, who had a history of dia-
betes or cardiovascular disease before
1995 or reported the diagnosis of can-
cer (except nonmelanoma skin can-
cer) on any questionnaire, who did not
report body weight on any question-
naire, or who had no data on physical
activity assessed in 1997. These exclu-
sions left a total of 51603 women for
the analyses. The study was approved

by the human research committees at
the Harvard School of Public Health and
Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Bos-
ton, Mass; completion of the self-
administered questionnaire was con-
sidered to imply informed consent.

Dietary Assessment
In 1991, the mailed questionnaire in-
cluded a 133- item semiquantitative food
frequency questionnaire. Women were
asked how often they had consumed a
commonly used unit or portion size of
each food on average over the previous
year, including 3 items on consump-
tion of sugar-sweetened soft drinks
(“Coke, Pepsi, or other cola with sugar,”
“caffeine-free Coke, Pepsi, or other cola
with sugar,” and “other carbonated bev-
erages with sugar”), 4 items on fruit juice
(“apple juice,” “orange juice,” “grape-
fruit juice,” and “other juice”), 1 item on
fruit punch, and 3 items on diet soft
drinks (“low-calorie cola with caf-
feine,” “low-calorie caffeine-free cola,”
and “other low-calorie beverages”). We
summed the intake of single items to cre-
ate a total of sugar-sweetened soft drink,
diet soft drink, and fruit juice consump-
tion. The 9 possible responses, ranging
from “never” to “6 or more times per
day,” were aggregated into 4 categories
(⬍1 drink per month, 1-4 drinks per
month, 2-6 drinks per week, and ⱖ1
drink per day). Similar questionnaires
were used to collect dietary informa-
tion in 1995 and 1999. Nutrient in-
takes were computed by multiplying the
frequency response by the nutrient con-
tent of the specified portion sizes. Val-
ues for nutrients were derived from the
US Department of Agriculture sources14
and supplemented with information
from manufacturers. The validity and
reliability of food frequency question-
naires similar to those used in the Nurses’
Health Study II have been described
elsewhere.15,16 Briefly, the correlation co-
efficients between questionnaire and
multiple dietary records were 0.84 for
cola-type soft drinks (sugar-sweetened
and diet combined), 0.36 for other car-
bonated soft drinks, 0.84 for orange juice,
and 0.56 for fruit punch in the Nurses’
Health Study I15 and were 0.84 for sugar-

sweetened cola, 0.55 for other sugar-
sweetened soft drinks, 0.73 for diet cola,
0.74 for other diet soft drinks, 0.78 for
orange juice, 0.77 for apple juice, 0.75
for grapefruit juice, and 0.89 for other
fruit juices in the Health Professionals
Follow-up Study,16 2 similar cohort stud-
ies among US health care professionals.

Assessment of Nondietary
Exposures
Information on age, weight, smoking sta-
tus, contraceptive use, postmeno-
pausal hormone therapy, and preg-
nancies was collected on biennial
questionnaires. We calculated body mass
index (BMI) as weight in kilograms di-
vided by the square of height in me-
ters; height was assessed at baseline only.
Self-reports of body weight were highly
correlated with technician-measured
weights (r=0.96) in the Nurses’ Health
Study I.17 Family history of diabetes was
reported in 1989 only. In 1991 and 1997,
participants were asked how many
flights of stairs they climb daily and the
amount of time per week they spent on
average on each of the following activi-
ties: walking or hiking outdoors; jog-
ging; running; bicycling; lap swim-
ming; tennis, squash, or racquetball
playing; calisthenics; and other aerobic
recreation. From this information,
weekly energy expenditure in meta-
bolic equivalent hours was calculated,
weighting each activity by its intensity
level.18 Physical activity reported on the
questionnaire was highly correlated with
activity recorded in diaries or by 24-
hour recall (0.79 vs 0.62).19 Because
physical activity was not assessed in
1995 or 1999, for our analysis on weight
change, we used the 1997 estimate for
both of these time points instead.

Ascertainment of Type 2 Diabetes
Women reporting a new diagnosis of
diabetes on any of the biennial ques-
tionnaires were sent supplementary
questionnaires asking about diagnosis
and treatment of their diabetes, as well
as history of ketoacidosis to confirm the
self-report and to distinguish between
type 1 and type 2 diabetes. In accor-
dance with the criteria of the National

diabetes required at least 1 of the fol-
lowing: (1) an elevated plasma glu-
cose concentration (fasting plasma glu-
cose ⱖ7.8 mmol/L [140 mg/dL],
random plasma glucose ⱖ11.1 mmol/L
[200 mg/dL], and/or plasma glucose
ⱖ11.1 mmol/L [200 mg/dL] after ⱖ2
hours during an oral glucose toler-
ance test) plus at least 1 classic symp-
tom (excessive thirst, polyuria, weight
loss, or hunger); (2) no symptoms but
at least 2 elevated plasma glucose con-
centrations (by the aforementioned cri-
teria) on different occasions; or (3)
treatment with hypoglycemic medica-
tion (insulin or oral hypoglycemic
agent). We used the National Diabe-
tes Data Group criteria to define dia-
betes because the majority of our cases
were diagnosed prior to the release of
the American Diabetes Association cri-
teria in 1997.21 In substudies of the
Nurses’ Health Study I and the Health
Professionals Follow-up Study, 98% and
97% of the self-reported diabetes cases
documented by the same supplemen-
tary questionnaire were confirmed by
medical record review.22,23

Statistical Analysis
We calculated the mean weight changes
for groups defined by change in soft drink
consumption from 1991 to 1995 and
from 1995 to 1999, adjusting for age,
alcohol intake, physical activity, smok-
ing, BMI, and other lifestyle and dietary
confounders at baseline for each period.
We also adjusted for food items that have
been previously shown to be associated
with sugar-sweetened soft drink con-
sumption.24 We additionally adjusted for
changes in these covariates (except BMI)
during the period 1991 to 1995 in a sepa-
rate model for that period.

We estimated the relative risk (RR) of
diabetes for each category of intake com-
pared with the lowest category using Cox
proportional hazards analysis stratified
by 5-year age categories and 2-year in-
tervals. Duration of follow-up was cal-
culated as the interval between the re-
turn of the 1991 questionnaire and
diagnosis of diabetes, death, or June 1,
1999. The 1991 intake was used for the

SUGAR-SWEETENED BEVERAGES AND DIABETES IN WOMEN

follow-up between 1991 and 1995, and
the average of the 1991 and 1995 in-
takes was used for the follow-up be-
tween 1995 and 1999 to reduce within-
participant variation and to best represent
long-term diet.25 We used the 1991 but
not the 1995 intake data for individuals
who reported on the 1993 or 1995 ques-
tionnaire a diagnosis of cancer (except
nonmelanoma skin cancer) or cardio-
vascular disease because changes in diet
after development of these conditions
may confound the relationship be-
tween dietary intake and diabetes.25

We used information on covariates
obtained from the baseline or subse-
quent questionnaires in multivariate
analyses. Because BMI and total energy
intake might represent intermediate end
points or pathways rather than con-
founders for sugar-sweetened soft
drinks, we adjusted for BMI and total ca-
loric intake in separate models. Nondi-
etary covariates were updated during fol-
low-up using the most recent data for
each 2-year follow-up interval. The sig-
nificance of linear trends across catego-
ries of beverage consumption was tested
by assigning to each participant the me-
dian value for the category and model-
ing this value as a continuous variable.
We evaluated whether the association
between sugar-sweetened soft drink con-
sumption and risk of diabetes was modi-
fied by BMI, physical activity, and a fam-
ily history of diabetes using analyses
stratified by these variables and by mod-
eling interaction terms.

All P values presented are 2-tailed;
P⬍.05 was considered statistically sig-
nificant. All statistical analyses were per-
formed using SAS software, version 8.0
(SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC).

RESULTS
Sugar-Sweetened Beverages
and Weight Change
Women with a higher intake of sugar-
sweetened soft drinks tended to be less
physically active, to smoke more, and
to have higher intake of total energy and
lower intake of protein, alcohol, mag-
nesium, and cereal fiber (TABLE 1). In-
take of total carbohydrates, sucrose, and
fructose as well as the overall glyce-

mic index were higher in women with
greater sugar-sweetened soft drink con-
sumption, but starch intake was lower.
Women who increased their sugar-
sweetened soft drink consumption
between 1991 and 1995 from low
(ⱕ1/wk) to high (ⱖ1/d) (n=1007) also
increased their reported total energy
intake by 358 kcal/d on average
(FIGURE 1). In contrast, women who re-
duced their sugar-sweetened soft drink
consumption between 1991 and 1995
(n=1020) also reduced their total en-
ergy consumption by 319 kcal/d on
average. Changes in energy intake
from food sources other than sugar-
sweetened soft drinks accounted for only
27% to 34% of these changes in total en-
ergy intake. Similar associations were ob-
served for the period 1995-1999.

For both periods 1991 to 1995 and
1995 to 1999, women who increased
their consumption of sugar-sweet-
ened soft drinks from low to high had
significantly larger increases in weight
(multivariate-adjusted means, 4.69 kg
during 1991-1995 and 4.20 kg during
1995-1999) and BMI (multivariate-
adjusted means, 1.72 during 1991-
1995 and 1.53 during 1995-1999) than
women who maintained a low or a high
intake or substantially reduced their in-
take (P⬍.001) (TABLE 2). The lowest
weight gain and increase in BMI were
observed among women who reduced
their intake from high to low (multi-
variate-adjusted mean change in weight,
1.34 kg during 1991-1995 and 0.15 kg
during 1995-1999; respective multi-
variate-adjusted mean change in BMI,
0.49 and 0.05). Because lifestyle and di-
etary changes might confound these as-
sociations, we repeated the analysis for
the period 1991 to 1995, additionally
controlling for changes in physical ac-
tivity and other covariates over time, but
results remained similar. We repeated
our analysis excluding all women who
reported a pregnancy in 1991, 1995, or
1999, but this had minimal impact on
our observations (data not shown).

Women who increased consump-
tion of fruit punch from 1 drink or less
per week in 1991 to 1 drink or more
per day in 1995 gained more weight

Sugar-Sweetened Beverages
and Risk of Diabetes
During 716300 person-years of follow-
up, we documented 741 new cases
of type 2 diabetes. Greater sugar-
sweetened soft drink consumption was
strongly associated with progressively
higher risk of type 2 diabetes (TABLE 3).
The age-adjusted RR was 1.98 (95% con-
fidence interval [CI], 1.60-2.44) for
women consuming 1 or more sugar-
sweetened soft drinks per day com-
pared with those consuming less than
1 sugar-sweetened soft drink per month.
This association was slightly attenu-
ated after adjustment for lifestyle and di-
etary confounders (RR for extreme cat-
egories, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.42-2.36; P⬍.001
for trend). The RR for extreme catego-
ries further controlling for BMI was 1.39
(95% CI, 1.07-1.76; P=.01 for trend).

This finding suggests that BMI ac-
counted for about half of the excess risk.
Adjustment for caloric intake in addi-
tion to BMI further attenuated the as-
sociation, but sugar-sweetened soft
drinks remained significantly associ-
ated with an increased risk of diabetes
(RR for extreme categories, 1.32; 95%
CI, 1.01-1.73; P=.04 for trend). The re-
sults for sugar-sweetened cola alone were
similar to those for all sugar-sweetened
soft drinks (Table 3). Similar to sugar-
sweetened soft drinks, fruit punch con-
sumption was significantly associated
with diabetes risk. The multivariate RR
for fruit punch consumption of 1 drink
or more per day compared with less than
1 drink per month was 2.00 (95% CI,
1.33-3.03; P=.001 for trend).

Additional adjustment for the waist-
hip ratio among women reporting waist
and hip circumferences in 1993
(n=43756) did not change our results
for sugar-sweetened soft drinks. Re-
sults were also similar adjusting for in-
take of caffeine, red meat, french fries,
processed meat, sweets, snacks, veg-
etables, and fruit. Associations did not
differ substantially by obesity status,
family history of diabetes, physical ac-

COMMENT
In this 8-year follow-up study of women,
we found positive associations be-
tween sugar-sweetened beverage con-
sumption and both greater weight gain
and risk of type 2 diabetes, indepen-
dent of known risk factors.

Sugar-sweetened soft drinks may
contribute to weight gain because of the
low satiety of liquid foods. Energy pro-
vided by sugar-sweetened beverages
does not affect subsequent food and en-
ergy intake in short-term human stud-
ies.26-28 Similarly, in experimental
animals, intake of sugar-sweetened bev-
erages is not fully compensated by re-
ductions in intake of solid foods, re-
sulting in a positive caloric balance
and development of obesity.29 Con-
sequently, consumption of sugar-
sweetened soft drinks significantly in-
creased caloric intake and body weight
over a 3-week period in normal-
weight adults,30 and supplementing su-
crose, mainly in the form of sugar-
sweetened soft drinks, over a 10-week
period to ad libitum diets in over-
weight men and women resulted in an
increase in energy intake and body
weight (by 1.6 kg) compared with de-
creases with artificially sweetened
supplements (by 0.3 kg).31 Consump-
tion of sugar-sweetened soft drinks has
also been associated with greater risk
of obesity in children,8 while consump-
tion of diet soft drinks has not. Inter-
estingly, in our study, women who in-
creased their sugar-sweetened soft drink
consumption also increased energy in-
take from other foods, indicating that
these beverages may even induce hun-
ger and food intake. However, experi-

SUGAR-SWEETENED BEVERAGES AND DIABETES IN WOMEN

mental data on soft drink consump-
tion and food intake have not provided
support for this hypothesis.32,33 Our ob-
servation may, therefore, rather re-
flect dietary and lifestyle changes ac-
companying changes in soft drink
consumption.

We observed no difference in weight
change between women with consis-
tently low or high sugar-sweetened soft
drink consumption. The lower weight
gain associated with reduction of sugar-
sweetened soft drink consumption
compared with stable intake suggests
that women do benefit from decreas-
ing consumption but that weight tra-
jectories do not continue to diverge with
time. Long-term effects of sugar-
sweetened beverages on body weight
have not been studied in experimental
settings so far, and further research is
warranted.

Besides their potential contribution to
weight gain, sugar-sweetened soft drinks
might also increase risk of type 2 diabe-
tes because of their high amount of rap-
idly absorbable carbohydrates. They con-
tain large amounts of high-fructose corn
syrup, which has similar effects on blood
glucose as sucrose,9 and consumption of
sugar-sweetened soft drinks induces a
fast and dramatic increase in both glu-
cose and insulin concentrations.34 Sugar-
sweetened soft drinks therefore contrib-
ute to a high glycemic index of the overall
diet, a risk factor for diabetes in this study
population35 and other cohort stud-
ies.11 In addition, cola-type soft drinks
contain caramel coloring, which is rich
in advanced glycation end products,
which may increase insulin resistance12
and inflammation.13 However, diet cola
was generally not associated with dia-
betes risk after adjustment for BMI. Ad-
vanced glycation end products there-
fore appear unlikely to account for the
association between sugar-sweetened soft
drinks and diabetes. In addition, soft
drinks often contain caffeine, which
might reduce diabetes risk.36,37 How-
ever, the caffeine content of soft drinks
(10-16 mg per 100 g) is considerably less
than in coffee (35-75 mg per 100 g) or
black tea (about 22 mg per 100 g) and
soft drinks might therefore contribute

moderately to variation in total caffeine
consumption in the adult US popula-
tion. In our study population, adjust-
ment for caffeine did not alter the asso-
ciation for soft drinks.

Fruit juice consumption was not as-
sociated with diabetes risk in our study,
which suggests that naturally occur-
ring sugars in beverages may have dif-
ferent metabolic effects than added sug-
ars. Fruit juices generally have a lower
glycemic index than sugar-sweetened
soft drinks and fruit punches.38 In ad-
dition, vitamins, minerals, soluble fi-
ber, and phytochemicals in fruit juices
may have beneficial effects counterbal-
ancing potential adverse effects of sug-
ars. In contrast, fruit punches contain
only a small proportion of fruit juice but
large amounts of added high-fructose
corn syrup and, therefore, provide little
nutritional value compared with pure
fruit juices. Our finding that fruit punch
consumption was associated with in-
creased diabetes risk suggests that its
physiological consequences may be
similar to sugar-sweetened soft drinks.
Imprecise dietary measurement could
potentially have influenced our ob-
served associations. However, ran-
dom errors in dietary assessment mea-
sures might have accounted for a lack
of association but not the reverse.25 The
repeated dietary measurements made in
this study were an advantage because
they reduce measurement errors and ac-
count for changes in eating patterns
over time.25 Because of the observa-
tional nature of the study, we cannot
prove that the observed associations are
causal because residual confounding
could theoretically affect the observed
associations. However, we controlled
for potential confounding by most
known risk factors that are plausibly as-
sociated with soft drink consumption
and changes in these variables over
time. Consistent with our observa-
tion, supplementation of sucrose,
mainly in the form of soft drinks, re-
sulted in increased energy consump-
tion in an experimental study, with the
increase largely attributable to the in-
creased sucrose intake.31 A further limi-
tation of our study is the reliance on

self-reported body weight. It is pos-
sible that underreporting of body
weight, particularly among heavier
women, may have led to an underesti-
mation of weight gain. However, cor-
relation between self-reported and tech-
nician-measured body weight was
found to be high in a similar cohort of
older female nurses,17 and underreport-
ing may be less prevalent among rela-
tively young women.39 Also, we used
the National Diabetes Data Group cri-
teria to define diabetes,20 but the diag-
nostic criteria were changed in 199721
such that lower fasting glucose levels
would be considered diagnostic. The
majority of our cases were diagnosed
prior to the release of the revised cri-
teria in 1997; the incidence of diabe-
tes in our cohort is therefore likely an
underestimation.

In conclusion, our findings suggest
that frequent consumption of sugar-
sweetened beverages may be associ-
ated with larger weight gain and in-
creased risk of type 2 diabetes, possibly
by providing excessive calories and
large amounts of rapidly absorbable
sugars. Public health strategies to pre-
vent obesity and type 2 diabetes should
focus on reducing sugar-sweetened bev-
erage consumption.

Abstract
Objective To summarise evidence on the association between intake
of dietary sugars and body weight in adults and children.
Design Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled
trials and prospective cohort studies.
Data sources OVID Medline, Embase, PubMed, Cumulative Index to
Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Scopus, and Web of Science (up
to December 2011).
Review methods Eligible studies reported the intake of total sugars,
intake of a component of total sugars, or intake of sugar containing foods
or beverages; and at least one measure of body fatness. Minimum
duration was two weeks for trials and one year for cohort studies. Trials
of weight loss or confounded by additional medical or lifestyle
interventions were excluded. Study selection, assessment, validity, data
extraction, and analysis were undertaken as specified by the Cochrane
Collaboration and the GRADE working group. For trials, we pooled data
for weight change using inverse variance models with random effects.
We pooled cohort study data where possible to estimate effect sizes,
expressed as odds ratios for risk of obesity or β coefficients for change
in adiposity per unit of intake.
Results 30 of 7895 trials and 38 of 9445 cohort studies were eligible.
In trials of adults with ad libitum diets (that is, with no strict control of
food intake), reduced intake of dietary sugars was associated with a
decrease in body weight (0.80 kg, 95% confidence interval 0.39 to 1.21;
P<0.001); increased sugars intake was associated with a comparable
weight increase (0.75 kg, 0.30 to 1.19; P=0.001). Isoenergetic exchange
of dietary sugars with other carbohydrates showed no change in body
weight (0.04 kg, −0.04 to 0.13). Trials in children, which involved

recommendations to reduce intake of sugar sweetened foods and
beverages, had low participant compliance to dietary advice; these trials
showed no overall change in body weight. However, in relation to intakes
of sugar sweetened beverages after one year follow-up in prospective
studies, the odds ratio for being overweight or obese increased was 1.55
(1.32 to 1.82) among groups with the highest intake compared with those
with the lowest intake. Despite significant heterogeneity in one
meta-analysis and potential bias in some trials, sensitivity analyses
showed that the trends were consistent and associations remained after
these studies were excluded.
Conclusions Among free living people involving ad libitum diets, intake
of free sugars or sugar sweetened beverages is a determinant of body
weight. The change in body fatness that occurs with modifying intakes
seems to be mediated via changes in energy intakes, since isoenergetic
exchange of sugars with other carbohydrates was not associated with
weight change.
Introduction
Sugar has been a component of human diets since ancient times,
with earliest reports of consumption coming from China and
India, and much later from Europe after the Crusades in the 11th
century.1 The suggestion that sugar might have adverse health
effects has been a recurring theme for decades, with claims that
high intake may be associated with an increased risk of
conditions as diverse as dental caries, obesity, cardiovascular
disease, diabetes, gout, fatty liver disease, some cancers, and
hyperactivity.2-6 However, inadequate study design, differences
in assessing dietary intake, inconsistent findings, and varying

definitions of “sugars” have precluded definitive conclusions
regarding these associations.
The most consistent association has been between a high intake
of sugar sweetened beverages and the development of obesity,7-12
but not all published meta-analyses have reported a statistically
significant link.7 11 The expert consultations organised by the
World Health Organization and the Food and Agriculture
Organization of the United Nations and the scientific updates
undertaken by WHO13-15 have adopted a classification of
carbohydrates and clarified definitions of various groups of
sugars including the category of “free sugars” (table 1⇓). This
classification enables a more standardised approach to
examining potential adverse health effects.
To update the recommendations through the guideline’s
development process that was launched in January 2009, WHO
commissioned a systematic literature review to answer a series
of questions16 relating to the effects of sugars on excess
adiposity. These questions asked whether reducing or increasing
intake of dietary sugars influences measures of body fatness in
adults and children, and whether the existing evidence provides
support for the recommendation to reduce intake of free sugars
to less than 10% total energy (box).15 Body fatness was selected
as an outcome in view of the extent to which comorbidities of
obesity contribute to the global burden of non-communicable
disease.
Since the answers to the questions posed (box) were designed
to inform population based dietary guidelines rather than advise
individual patients, it was deemed appropriate to include cohort
studies and randomised controlled trials of free living people
consuming ad libitum diets (that is, with no strict control of
food intake). The interventions mainly involved advice to
increase or decrease intake of sugars, or of sugar containing
foods or beverages, without emphasising the need to achieve
weight loss.
We also examined randomised controlled trials comparing
higher and lower intakes of sugars, but where energy intake was
strictly controlled. Trials specifically designed to achieve weight
loss were excluded. We acknowledged that the studies identified
by this approach would inevitably be heterogeneous, that it
would be difficult to disentangle the effects of a range of dietary
changes that might occur after altering the intake of sugars, and
that it might be difficult to identify a dose response. However,
the findings from such an approach were expected to provide
an indication of what might be achieved by population changes
in intake of dietary sugars.
Methods
In accordance with the WHO guideline’s development process,17
systematic reviews and meta-analyses were conducted according
to the methods of the Cochrane Collaboration.18 We prepared
tables summarising quality assessment, effect size, and
importance of findings, from which recommendations may be
derived, in the format required by the Grading of
Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation
(GRADE) working group. Ethical approval was not required
for this research.
Search strategy
Two separate electronic searches were conducted to identify
randomised trials and prospective cohort studies relating intake
of dietary sugars to measures or changes of body fatness (web
appendix 1). OVID Medline, Embase, PubMed, Cumulative
Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Scopus, and Web

of Science electronic databases were searched for clinical trials
and cohort studies, published up to December 2011, which met
the inclusion criteria. In OVID Medline, we used the highly
sensitive Cochrane search strategy to limit the first search to
clinical trials, meta-analyses, and randomised controlled trials.
We hand searched meta-analyses and reviews to identify studies
that might have been missed.
Study selection
Two reviewers assessed titles and abstracts of all identified
English language studies. Discrepancies in opinion as to whether
studies should be selected for full review were resolved by
discussion. A similar approach was used to determine which of
these studies should be included in the formal analysis. Animal
studies, cross sectional studies, and case-control studies were
excluded. Studies were required to report intake of total sugars,
intake of a component of total sugars (expressed in absolute
amounts or as a percentage of total energy), or intake of sugar
containing foods or beverages, assessed by continuous or
categorical variables; and at least one measure of body fatness.
Participants were adults and children free from acute illness,
but those with diabetes or other non-communicable diseases in
whom conditions were regarded as stable could be included.
Randomised trials were required to be of at least two weeks’
duration, and prospective cohort studies were required to be of
at least one year’s duration. We included trials comparing diets
differing in sugars intakes and in which the effect of sugars
could be separated from the effects of other lifestyle or medical
interventions.
Two groups of trials were identified. One group included studies
in which participants in the intervention arm were advised to
decrease or increase sugars, or foods and drinks containing
sugars. Although such advice was generally accompanied by
the recommendation to increase or decrease other forms of
carbohydrate, there was no strict attempt at weight control.
These trials are referred to as ad libitum studies. The other group
of trials attempted to achieve isoenergetic replacement of sugars
with other forms of carbohydrate. Interventions designed to
achieve weight loss were excluded because the ultimate aim of
the review was to facilitate the development of population based
recommendations rather than nutritional recommendations for
the management of obesity.
Data extraction and quality assessment
Data extraction and validity assessment were carried out
independently by two reviewers, and any discrepancies resolved
by discussion. For both randomised trials and cohort studies,
outcomes, data relating to participants, exposure or interventions,
potential effect modifiers, and study quality were extracted by
use of piloted data extraction forms. In the cohort studies, we
aimed to extract the least and most adjusted relative risk, odds
ratio, or mean difference when comparing the most exposed
group of participants with the least exposed group, or a β
coefficient for the continuous effect of a one unit change in
sugars intake. We extracted these statistics separately for sugars
exposures reported as baseline values or as values for change
over time.
Cochrane criteria18 were used to examine validity of each
randomised trial, including sequence generation, allocation
concealment, blinding of participants, personnel and outcome
assessors, incomplete outcome data, and selective outcome
reporting. Additional review specific criteria included similarity,
or not, of type and intensity of intervention in both arms, and
whether the studies were funded by industries with potentially

Questions posed by the WHO Nutrition Guidance Expert Advisory Group-Subgroup on Diet and Health, to develop
recommendations regarding sugars intakes

What is the effect of a reduction in free sugars intakes in adults?
What is the effect of an increase in free sugars intakes in adults?
What is the effect of a reduction in free sugars intakes in children?
What is the effect of an increase in free sugars intakes in children?
(Where “free sugars” are defined as all monosaccharides and disaccharides added to foods by the manufacturer, cook, or consumer;
plus sugars naturally present in honey, syrups, and fruit juices.)

vested interests. We examined the effect of bias on the pooled
effect estimates by excluding studies that had a high risk of bias
for two or more validity criteria in sensitivity analyses.
Statistical analysis
Studies were grouped to answer the major questions that had
been posed (box). We considered data for adults and children
separately. Studies of isoenergetic exchange of sugars with other
carbohydrates were examined to help explain possible
mechanisms through which sugars might exert their effects.
Randomised trials
The effects of decreasing or increasing dietary sugars in adults
were examined principally by meta-analysing the randomised
trials in which participants were required to consume different
amounts of sugar (sucrose) or other sugars (which would now
be classified as “free sugars”). Terminology varied among trials.
The term “free sugars” refers to all monosaccharides and
disaccharides added to foods by the manufacturer, cook, or
consumer, plus sugars naturally present in honey, syrups, and
fruit juices (table 1).14 The term “added sugar” is sometimes
used interchangeably with “free sugar” but is considered to
include sugars and syrups added to foods during processing,
food preparation, or at the table—but does not include honey,
syrups, or fruit juice.19 “Sugar” is generally assumed to be
purified sucrose.14
Data for each group of studies were pooled using Review
Manager 5.1 software.20 In trials involving adult participants,
we used generic inverse variance of analysis for mean
differences in body weight between intervention and control
groups to compare the parallel and crossover experimental
designs reporting change in body weight. In the studies involving
children and adolescents, we used standardised mean differences
because studies reported differences in either body mass index
(BMI) or standardised BMI units.
Heterogeneity was assessed with the I2 test and Q statistics. We
considered an I2 value greater than 50% and P<0.05 as indicative
of heterogeneity.18 We used random effects models because
significant heterogeneity was associated with trial design and
duration in some analyses.
Estimates for the standard error of the difference in means for
treatment groups in crossover studies were derived from reported
P values when the standard error of the mean difference was
not reported.18 If P values for the differences were reported
simply as non-significant, then P=0.2 was assumed.18
We did sensitivity analyses to explore the differences between
studies in the short term (<eight weeks) and longer term (>eight
weeks). We also tested the effects of removing those studies
that achieved a difference in sugars intakes of less than 5% of
total energy intake between intervention and control groups.
Metaregression (using Stata/IC 11.2 software for Mac
(StataCorp)) was used to test for a dose-response effect of sugars
on weight change, and for associations between weight change

and study duration, study design (that is, crossover or parallel),
and whether sugars intake changed in the intervention arm.
Publication bias among the randomised controlled trials of adults
was examined by visual inspection of a funnel plot and Egger’s
test for bias.21 Publication bias is suspected when the funnel plot
is asymmetrical. We combined the 15 ad libitum studies for this
analysis because it is generally accepted that asymmetry cannot
readily be assessed with 10 or fewer studies.18 Sensitivity
analyses examined the influence of small study effects, by
comparing the estimates derived from random and fixed effects
models22 and by using the Duval and Tweedie23 “trim and fill”
method in Stata 12 (Metatrim). There were insufficient studies
in children to conduct a meaningful examination of publication
bias.
Prospective cohort studies
Cohort studies in adults provided limited additional information.
Data from cohort studies in children were necessary to determine
the effect of increasing sugars intake on adiposity, owing to a
lack of suitable randomised trials. We grouped individual studies
for meta-analysis on the basis of the methods used for reporting
adiposity outcomes and sugars exposure variables.
We used four main methods of reporting outcomes:

• β coefficients for the continuous association between sugars
exposure at baseline and adiposity outcome.
• Odds ratios for the risk of overweight or obesity comparing
participants who had the highest intakes of sugars with
those who had the lowest intakes of sugars (groups or
frequency of servings).
• Mean differences in change in measures of adiposity over
time between participants with the highest intakes of sugars
and those with the lowest intakes (groups or frequency of
servings).
• β coefficients for the continuous association between
increases in sugars exposure over time and adiposity
outcome.

Sugars exposures included sugar sweetened beverages, fruit
juice, sweets (including jams, syrups, cakes, and desserts),
sucrose, or total sugars. Exposures were reported as servings
per time period and were converted to servings per day, volume
of beverage consumed per day, percentage of energy intake,
frequency of consumption, or grams per day. Where possible,
we scaled exposures to comparable units to allow data to be
pooled. We assumed that one serving of sugar sweetened
beverage was equivalent to 240 mL or 8 fluid ounces, and
contained 26 g of sucrose.24 This portion equated to about 5%
of daily total energy intake in adults.
Measures of body fatness included weight change, change in
BMI or BMI z score, waist circumference, body fat (%), fat
mass, and trunk fat (%). If studies reported more than one
measure of sugars intake, we derived an average effect size. We
ranked adiposity outcomes in terms of importance for pooling,
from highest to lowest: BMI z score, BMI, body weight, waist

circumference, percentage body fat, fat mass, and percentage
trunk fat. If studies reported outcomes for more than one
measure of adiposity, we used the highest ranked adiposity
outcome. We generated pooled estimates for the various
subgroups using metan commands with random effects in Stata.
Two sided P<0.05 was considered significant for all analyses.
GRADE assessment
GRADE assessment25 was carried out to assess the totality of
the evidence by the authors and then refined by the WHO
Nutrition Guidance Expert Advisory Group (NUGAG) Subgroup
on Diet and Health (www.who.int/nutrition/topics/advisory_
group/en/index.html) to fulfil the required process for developing
WHO guidelines.17 GRADE assessment took into account study
design limitations, consistency of results across the available
studies, precision of the results, directness, and likelihood of
publication bias when assessing the quality of the evidence from
the randomised trials.17 25 Further criteria were considered for
the cohort studies. These criteria included magnitude of the
effect, evidence of a dose-response gradient, and the direction
of plausible biases. The quality of the evidence was categorised
as high, moderate, low, or very low. Web appendix 2 shows the
relevant GRADE tables.
Results
Figures 1⇓ and 2⇓ show the process by which the included
studies were identified. We identified 7895 potential randomised
trials from the electronic search and a further 10 studies through
hand searches of relevant review articles and on recommendation
from NUGAG panel members. Removing duplicates left 6634
articles, of which 6557 were assessed to be irrelevant. Abstracts
and full text articles for the remaining 77 studies were judged
as requiring full review and were reviewed by three independent
reviewers. Of these remaining studies, 19 met the inclusion
criteria for ad libitum studies 26-47 and 11 were identified for the
comparative analysis of isoenergetic studies.48-58 For cohort
studies, we identified 9445 potential studies from the electronic
search and an additional 10 studies through hand searches of
relevant review articles. Of 69 studies selected for full review,
38 were considered to meet the inclusion criteria.59-74 The 47
excluded randomised trials and 31 excluded cohort studies are
described in web appendices 3 and 4.
Assessment of study quality
Risk of bias varied among the randomised trials (web figs 1 and
2, web appendix 5). Failure to conceal treatment allocation
(almost impossible to achieve in dietary trials involving free
living participants) was the major potential source of bias
(performance bias). In many trials, it was unclear as to whether
outcome measures had been assessed by observers unaware of
treatment allocation (detection bias) and whether there had been
selection bias. Three trials, in which there was evidence of
differences between dropouts and completers, reported data
only for those who completed the intervention.28 34 39
Our analysis included 38 prospective studies lasting at least 12
months, and in which data relating to an association between
sugars and a measure of adiposity could be extracted; none was
excluded on the basis of study quality. Of these 38 studies, 15
used self reported estimates of adiposity outcomes59 64-68 70 71 73-80;
seven collected exposure data from questionnaires where the
validity for assessing sugars intake was not stated or not
assessed60 61 67 79 81 82; 19 involved convenience
sampling59 61 62 67 71 73 78 83-93; and 18 provided estimates that were
adjusted for total energy intake.59 60 64 66 69 72 75 76 86 88 90-97 There

was a lack of consistency in the covariates used to adjust
analyses and a wide range of methods of assessing sugars
exposures and adiposity outcomes, which made pooling studies
difficult.
Effect of reducing dietary sugars on measures
of body fatness in adults
Table 2⇓ describes the five studies identified for this
analysis,28 30 31 33 41 49 and figure 3⇓ shows the quantitative
meta-analysis (forest plot). Reduction in dietary sugars intake
was associated with significantly reduced weight (−0.80 kg
(95% confidence interval −1.21 to −0.39); P<0.001) at the end
of the intervention period by comparison with no reduction or
an increase in sugars intake. The trials all involved a reduction
in intake of sugars (classified as free sugars) in the intervention
arm compared with the control arm.28 31 33 39 41 Study durations
ranged from 10 weeks to eight months. In four studies,
participants were advised to limit sugar containing foods,31 33 39 41
and in one study, participants were asked to substitute usual
sugar rich foods with low sugar alternatives.28 Three of the five
trials reported data for completers only.28 39 41 However, only
two of these studies considered this to be a potential source of
bias.28 41 Exclusion of these two studies from the meta-analysis
slightly attenuated the effect, although the effect estimate
remained significant (−0.81 kg, −1.41 to −0.21). After excluding
three studies28 39 41 that had a high risk of bias for two or more
validity criteria, the effect estimate was no longer significant
although the difference in weight was similar (−0.81 kg, −1.69
to 0.07).
Differences in sugar intakes between intervention and control
groups ranged from less than 1%33 to 14% of total energy
intake.39 Two studies achieved a difference in reported sugars
intake of less than 5% of total energy intake at the end of the
intervention.28 33 Paineau and colleagues33 reported a difference
in sugars intake between groups of 2.2 g/day, and Gatenby and
colleagues28 reported a difference of about 3% of energy intake
(15 g/day). Exclusion of these studies from the meta-analysis
strengthened the overall effect of lowered sugar intakes on body
weight change (−1.22 kg, 95% confidence interval −1.81 to
−0.63). We saw no evidence of heterogeneity (I2=17%, P=0.3),
and the test for overall effect showing an association between
sugar reduction and increased weight loss was highly significant.
Effects of increasing dietary sugars on
measures of body fatness in adults
Table 3⇓ describes the 10 studies identified for this analysis,
and figure 4⇓ shows the quantitative meta-analysis (forest
plot).26 32 34 36-38 43-45 47 Because there was statistical evidence for
significant heterogeneity among the studies (I2=82%, P<0.001),
we used a random effects model to derive the pooled estimates.
Increased intake in dietary sugars was associated with
significantly greater weight (0.75 kg (95% confidence interval
0.30 to 1.19); P=0.001) at the end of the intervention period by
comparison with no increase in sugars intake. The studies
involved an increase in dietary sugars; mostly sugar sweetened
beverages, in the intervention arm of the randomised trial. Only
two studies lasted longer than eight weeks.34 36 Subgroup analysis
for these two longer term studies resulted in a significantly
greater effect size (2.73 kg, 1.68 to 3.78) than the pooled effect
for the shorter term studies (0.52 kg, 0.14 to 0.89). The
difference between these subgroups was highly significant
(P<0.001).
One trial reported a higher rate of participant dropout in the
high sugars group than in the low sugars group and presented

results for only participants who completed the whole study.37
Exclusion of this study from the meta-analysis increased the
overall effect size slightly (0.83 kg, 95% confidence interval
0.31 to 1.35). The association also remained significant after
excluding from the meta-analysis five studies26 32 34 37 43 that had
a high risk of bias for two or more validity criteria (0.96 kg,
0.06 to 1.85).
Isoenergetic exchanges of dietary sugars with
other carbohydrates or other macronutrient
sources
We identified 12 studies that involved isoenergetic exchange
of dietary sugars with other macronutrients (table 4⇓).48-58
Interventions ranged from two weeks to six months, and sugars
were in the form of either sucrose or fructose used to sweeten
foods or liquids. We saw no evidence of difference in weight
change as a result of differences in sugars intakes when energy
intakes were equivalent (0.04 kg (95% confidence interval −0.04
to 0.13); fig 5⇓).
Findings of cohort studies
Table 5⇓ describes 16 cohort studies in adults that provided
analyses of the relation between sugars exposures and measures
of adiposity.59-62 64-74 76 With a vote counting approach, 11 studies
reported one or more significantly positive associations between
a sugars exposure and a measure of adiposity,59-62 64 65 68-71 73 74
and one study reported a significantly negative association.73
Two studies reporting changes in intake of sugar sweetened
beverages during follow-up showed a significantly greater
increase in weight change among participants with the highest
intake than in those with the lowest intake.71 74 Web table 1
summarises pooled estimates for the relation between sugars
intakes and various measures of adiposity from all other
prospective studies in adults that met the inclusion criteria.
Forest plots for these comparisons are provided in web figures
3-5 (web appendix 5).
Effects of reducing dietary sugars on
measures of body fatness in children
Table 6⇓ describes the five intervention trials identified for this
analysis, and figure 6⇓ shows the forest plot.27 29 33 40 46
Interventions generally included advice to reduce sugar
sweetened beverages and other foods containing (free) sugars.
We saw no association between such advice to reduce intake
of dietary sugars and change in standardised BMI or BMI z
score in children (0.09, 95% confidence interval −0.14 to 0.32).
The studies included in this meta-analysis involved advice to
reduce the intake of sugar sweetened beverages alone,27 29 40 or
together with a further reduction in other sugar rich foods and
an increase in dietary fibre.33 46 Poor compliance with the
intervention advice was reported in three of the five studies,29 33 46
and the effect of the intervention was a reduction of 51 mL/day
in another study.40 Significant heterogeneity was observed and
a random effects model was used for the meta-analysis.
Excluding the study by Davis and colleagues,46 which had a
high risk of bias for two or more validity criteria, did not alter
the effect estimate.
Effects of increasing dietary sugars on
measures of body fatness in children
There were no randomised trials available in children, thus we
used data from 21 cohort studies in children (reported in 22
articles) to assess the effect of increasing sugars intakes on body
fatness (table 7⇓). Most studies related to intake of sugar

sweetened beverages. A quantitative meta-analysis (fig 7⇓) was
based on five cohort studies, with seven comparisons. These
studies reported data for the odds of being overweight at
follow-up in children consuming about one daily serving of
sugar sweetened beverages at baseline compared with children
consuming none or very little.80 94-97 Comparison of the higher
intakes with lower intakes suggested a significantly increased
risk of being overweight associated with higher intakes (odds
ratio 1.55, 95% confidence interval 1.32 to 1.82). We saw no
evidence of heterogeneity, and all the studies reported a positive
association. When assessing the 23 cohort studies in children
using a “vote counting” approach, 15 reported a positive
association between increased sugars intake and a measure of
adiposity.75 79-82 86 88 89 91 92 94-98 Fourteen of these 15 studies
reported the sugars exposure as a sugar sweetened beverage.
By contrast, only four studies reported a negative
association,87 90 93 98 of which two reported fruit juice as the
sugars exposure.90 98
Web table 2 summarises pooled and unpooled estimates for the
association between sugars intakes and measures of adiposity
from all other prospective studies in children that met the
inclusion criteria. Because of the wide variation in how the
study effects were reported, it was not always possible to pool
studies reporting similar outcomes, and there was no evidence
of association between increased sugars and adiposity. Web
figures 6 and 7 (web appendix 5) show forest plots.
Sensitivity analyses
The overall meta-regression of randomised trials examining the
effect of sugars on adiposity in adults showed no evidence of a
dose-response association between sugar as a percentage of total
energy intake and body weight (0.02 kg (95% confidence
interval −0.03 to 0.08); P=0.392). The difference in weight
changes associated with differing intakes of sugars was unrelated
to study design (crossover or parallel design trials; 0.30 kg
(−0.44 to 1.05); P=0.393), study duration (0.01 kg per week
(−0.02 to 0.05); P=0.460), or whether sugars intakes were
reduced or increased in the intervention arm relative to the
control arm (0.12 kg (−0.73 to 0.96); P=0.817).
Publication bias
The funnel plot of all 15 randomised ad libitum trials conducted
in adults was asymmetrical and the Egger’s test for bias was
significant (P=0.001), which suggested possible publication
bias (fig 8⇓). The pooled effect size for all 15 trials was 0.78
kg (95% confidence interval 0.43 to 1.12), based on a random
effects model which accounted for significant heterogeneity
(I2=77%, P<0.001) seen between the relatively short term
crossover trials with small variances and the longer term parallel
trials with larger variances. Use of fixed effects models
attenuated the overall effect (0.42 kg, 0.28 to 0.56), but it
remained significant. Excluding the studies with the largest
study variances34 41 from the analysis had little effect (0.72, 0.37
to 1.06). Trim and fill analysis showed a somewhat attenuated
but significant effect size (0.50, 0.18 to 0.21). Visual inspection
of the funnel plot and the Egger’s test for bias (P=0.248) did
not suggest publication bias among the isoenergetic trials.
Discussion
The meta-analyses based on controlled trials provide consistent
evidence that increasing or decreasing intake of dietary sugars
from current levels of intake is associated with corresponding
changes in body weight in adults. Although some evidence of
potential publication bias existed, this did not seem to have an

important effect on the findings. Results from cohort studies
were generally comparable with the trial findings. The reviewed
studies largely related to the manipulation or observation of
intake of sugars which, using current terminology, would be
described as “free sugars.” Two six month trials, 99 100 published
subsequent to the census date for this systematic review,
involved different intakes of sugar sweetened beverages in
adults. The trials also showed a trend towards increased body
weight in participants with raised intake, but the difference
between groups was not significant, perhaps owing to small
number of participants.
Poor compliance with dietary advice could explain why the data
from trials in children were equivocal. This was confirmed by
two controlled trials published after our systematic review’s
census date.101 102 De Ruyter and colleagues101 showed a smaller
increase in BMI z score after 18 months among trial completers
who were provided with sugar free, artificially sweetened
beverages, compared with participants who received equal
quantities of sugar sweetened beverages. Ebbeling and
colleagues102 showed the potential of an intervention designed
to decrease the consumption of sugar sweetened beverages in
overweight and obese adolescents. BMI and body weight were
significantly reduced after one year in the intervention group
compared with the control group. However, after a further year’s
follow-up with no further intervention, the difference between
the groups was no longer significant.
Cohort studies in children confirmed a link between intake of
sugar sweetened beverages and the risk of becoming overweight,
but showed no consistent associations between other measures
of sugars intake and adiposity. Although comparison of groups
with the highest versus lowest intakes in cohort studies was
compatible with a recommendation to restrict intake to below
10% total energy, currently available data did not allow formal
dose-response analysis.
Strengths and limitation
An important strength of this in depth review of the literature
lay in the overall quality and consistency of the data, especially
those derived from adult populations. Although the trials were
published over a long timeframe and used different experimental
approaches, the results were consistent. Evidence was derived
principally from randomised trials, but data from cohort studies
that compared higher and lower groups of intake were also
confirmatory. Criteria from both GRADE25 and the World
Cancer Research Fund103 for judging strength of evidence of
association specify randomised controlled trials as the highest
level of evidence, but evidence from another study type is
recognised as providing important confirmation.
We found less consistent findings from the trials conducted in
children, which can be attributed to several factors. These trials
tended to last longer than adult trials, and where compliance
was assessed, it was clear that adherence to dietary advice
(typically advice to reduce sugar sweetened beverages) was
poor. For example, in a trial by Davis and colleagues,46 children
receiving nutrition education to improve carbohydrate quality
achieved a reduction in added sugars intake of only 8 g/day,
compared with control children. However, in children (as in
adults), comparison of the highest intakes with the lowest intakes
(usually of sugar sweetened beverages) suggested that those
participants consuming the largest quantities had a higher body
weight or other measure of adiposity.
The limitations of these findings are those inherent to the
primary research on which they are based, notably inadequacy
of dietary intake data, and variation in the nature and quality of

the dietary intervention. Most cohort studies and some trials
reported effects largely or solely related to the consumption of
sugar sweetened beverages. Most trials involved different levels
of intake of sugar (sucrose) and other monosaccharides and
disaccharides in the control and intervention arms. These
compounds have been described as “free sugars,” as defined by
WHO (all monosaccharides and disaccharides added to foods
by the manufacturer, cook, or consumer, plus sugars naturally
present in honey, syrups, and fruit juices).14 We had originally
intended to report separately on the effects of total sugars as
well as the various subcategories of sugars, but presentation of
data in the studies precluded such analyses.
Assessment of dietary intake of sugars, whether by some method
of recall as used in the trials, or by food frequency questionnaires
as in cohort studies, was associated with a considerable degree
of measurement error even when using validated methods. This
is probably one explanation why a dose-response effect could
not be shown between change in dietary intake and magnitude
of weight change. Nevertheless, even crude estimates of intake
provided assistance in interpreting potentially inconsistent
findings. The studies of long term intervention in
children27 29 33 40 46 and two studies of interventions reducing
dietary sugars in adults28 33 found little difference in intakes
between intervention and control groups, and no meaningful
change in weight.
The heterogeneity of the studies, especially in terms of the
consequences of altering intake of sugars in ad libitum diets,
resulted in difficulties in fully explaining the effects of different
dietary changes. Nevertheless, the changes in weight observed
in studies of adults provided some indication of what might be
achieved by the implementation of a dietary guideline relating
to sugar, and conversely what might occur if consumption
continued to increase.
The potential problem of residual confounding to explain some
or all of an effect is inherent to all cohort studies. However, the
overall consistency of our findings, regardless of study type, is
reassuring. The only potential major source of bias identified
in the trials was that four trials in adults reported data for
completers. These data could have overestimated the effect, but
we saw no meaningful difference in the magnitude of the effect
between these trials and the other studies. Both participants and
researchers in many of the trials were not blinded to intervention
allocation. Studies providing beverages as a means of
manipulating sugars intakes were blinded, but blinding was
clearly not possible in studies relying on the provision of dietary
advice to manipulate sugars intake. However, we do not believe
that a lack of blinding altered our findings substantially.
Measurement of body weight did not involve judgment that was
subject to bias.
Potential mechanisms
The most obvious mechanism by which increasing sugars might
promote weight gain is by increasing energy consumption to
an extent that exceeds energy output and distorts energy balance.
For sugar sweetened beverages, it has been suggested that energy
in liquid form could be less satiating than when derived from
solid foods, resulting in increased consumption.104 Solid foods
containing sugars are typically (although not invariably) energy
dense, and frequent and substantial consumption of energy dense
foods is associated with excessive weight gain and other
measures of excess adiposity. We observed that isoenergetic
replacement of dietary sugars with other macronutrients resulted
in no change in weight (fig 5). This finding strongly suggested
that energy imbalance is a major determinant of the potential

for dietary sugars to influence measures of body fatness.
However, other less direct mechanisms independent of energy
balance have been proposed.
Sugars (particularly table sugar, sucrose, and high fructose corn
syrup) contribute to the intake of fructose, which in turn can, at
least in some people, increase levels of uric acid and
hyperinsulinaemia.105 Hyperuricaemia has been identified as a
potentially important and independent predictor of obesity and
the metabolic syndrome.2 Sugar sweetened beverages and other
sources of dietary fructose have been suggested to promote the
deposition of liver, skeletal, and visceral fat and an increase in
serum lipids independently of an effect on body weight.106
Although this issue is relevant to any overarching discussion
regarding the health consequences of dietary sugars and the
extent to which they should be restricted, it is beyond the scope
of this review.
Results in the context of existing knowledge
Most of the relevant published studies, reviews, and
meta-analyses related to the association between intake of sugar
sweetened beverages and body weight, weight gain, or other
measures of adiposity. Widely discrepant conclusions have
emerged, ranging from strong or convincing evidence for an
association8 107 to evidence described as inconclusive or
equivocal.3 7 11 108-110 This variance is hardly surprising, owing
to the poor compliance in most intervention trials, the insensitive
instruments used for assessing dietary intakes in cohort studies,
and that in such studies, intakes might have changed between
initial dietary assessment and measurement of outcome. One
meta-analysis combined data for adults and children.11 We found
no evidence for an association between intake and weight in
children when considering the intervention trials, nor were the
data sufficient to examine for a dose-response effect when
considering β coefficients for the continuous association between
baseline sugars exposure and adiposity outcome. Nevertheless,
we were able to show a consistent effect when comparing groups
with the highest intakes of sugars with those with the lowest
intakes.
There have been fewer reviews and meta-analyses relating to
sugars or sugar rather than sugar sweetened beverages. In a
systematic review and meta-analysis, Sievenpiper and colleagues
concluded that isoenergetic substitution of fructose for other
carbohydrates was not associated with weight gain.110 However,
free fructose at high doses that provided excess calories
modestly increased body weight to an extent probably due to
the extra calories rather than any particular metabolic attributes
of fructose. Dolan and colleagues111 drew similar conclusions
when reviewing studies in which fructose was fed at “normal
levels of intake.” Van Baak and Astrup3 and Ruxton104 recently
concluded that there was insufficient evidence to indicate that
replacing sugars with other carbohydrates resulted in a reduction
in body weight. However, by limiting analyses to ad libitum
trials, and considering studies in adults and children separately,
our systematic review showed a clear positive association
between higher intake of sugars and body fatness in adults, and
provided an explanation as to why the findings in children were
less conclusive.
Conclusions
This series of meta-analyses provides evidence that intake of
sugars is a determinant of body weight in free living people
consuming ad libitum diets. The data suggest that the change
in body fatness that occurs with modifying intake of sugars
results from an alteration in energy balance rather than a

physiological or metabolic consequence of monosaccharides or
disaccharides. Owing to the multifactorial causes of obesity, it
is unsurprising that the effect of reducing intake is relatively
small. The extent to which population based advice to reduce
sugars might reduce risk of obesity cannot be extrapolated from
the present findings, because few data from the studies lasted
longer than ten weeks. However, when considering the rapid
weight gain that occurs after an increased intake of sugars, it
seems reasonable to conclude that advice relating to sugars
intake is a relevant component of a strategy to reduce the high
risk of overweight and obesity in most countries.

What is already known on this topic

Excessive intakes of dietary sugars have been linked to obesity, and a higher risk of chronic diseases, but the link with obesity is tenuous
The most consistent association has been between a high intake of sugar sweetened beverages and the development of obesity
No upper safe limit of intake has been agreed universally, but WHO has suggested that intakes of free sugars should be less than 10%
of the total energy intake

What this study adds

Among free living people, advice to reduce free sugars was associated with an average 0.80 kg reduction in weight; advice to increase
intake was associated with a corresponding 0.75 kg increase
This parallel effect seems to be due to an altered energy intake; isoenergetic replacement of sugars with other carbohydrates did not
result in any change in body weight
Evidence was less consistent in children than in adults

Findings*

In boys, significant associations
between SSB consumption at
baseline and 1 year weight gain, and
between increasing SSB consumption
and 1 years weight gain were seen
in adjusted analyses (both P≤0.038).
After adjusting for total energy intake,
effect sizes in boys and girls were
reduced, and associations were
rendered non-significant
Regression analysis of BMI z score
at follow-up showed no association
with SSB consumption (data not
reported)
Energy intake from sucrose and
added sugars was not found to be
associated with weight gain

with a 0.005 increase in BMI z score
(P<0.01) in pooled analysis, a 0.009
increase for people at risk of
overweight (P<0.01), and a
non-significant increase of 0.003 for
those not at risk of overweight

SSB intake at age 5 years was a
significant predictor of adiposity at
each 2 year time point during ages
5-15 years in unadjusted ANOVA
analyses. Greater consumption of
SSB at 5 years was associated with
a higher WC at 15 years, after
adjusting for intake of SSB and
energy at 15 years and family income
at 15 years (all P<0.05), but
association was non-significant after
adjusting for maternal BMI and

Findings*

Higher % energy intakes from total
added sugars and added sugar in
beverages and sweets at age 1 year
were negatively associated with BMI
z score at age 7 years. BMI z score
increase per 1% energy from total
added sugar: β −0.116 (SE 0.057,
P=0.04; from added sugar in
beverages and sweets: −0.250
(0.103, P=0.02). No associations
were observed between % energy
intakes from sugars and % BF
After adjusting for sex and height, fat
mass index‡ at age 9 years
correlated with SSB intake at 5 and
7 years (Pearson’s correlation
coefficient P values 0.06 and 0.03,
respectively). In multivariate
regression analysis, fat mass at 9
years was negatively associated with
FJ intake at 5 years (−0.55 kg/daily
serving, 95% CI –1.08 to –0.02)
5 year changes in BMI z score and
BF (%) were not related to baseline
intake of SSB, FJ, or combination of
both. Change in BMI z score was
positively associated with concurrent
change in energetic beverage intake
in girls (β 0.07, P=0.01) and with
concurrent change in FJ intake in girls
(β 0.096; P=0.013)
Odds of becoming overweight
increased by 4% (95% CI 1% to 7%;
P<0.05) per ounce of fruit drink
consumed per day at baseline, 4%
(1% to 6%; P<0.05) per ounce of all
SSB consumed per day at baseline,
and 4% per ounce of SSSD
consumed per day at baseline,
although non-significantly (95% CI
−1% to 10%; P>0.05). No significant
association found between change in
beverage intakes and incidence of
overweight (data not reported). No
significant association found between
change in beverage intakes and
change in BMI z score
For each serving of SSB
consumed/day at baseline, BMI
increased by 0.18 (95% CI 0.09 to
0.27; P=0.02), and for each SSB
serve/d increase from baseline, BMI
increased by 0.24 (0.10 to 0.39;
P=0.03). Incident obesity was not
associated with baseline SSB intake
(OR 1.48, 95% CI 0.63 to 3.47;
P=0.27), but was associated with an
increase in SSB intake, with a 60%
higher risk of developing obesity for
each serving/day increase (95% CI
14–124%; P=0.02).

Findings*

The predicted difference in adult BMI
per 10-unit consumption difference of
SSSD or sweets in childhood did not
reach statistical significance for males
or females. An increase in the
frequency of SSSD consumption from
childhood to adulthood was
associated with a higher BMI in adult
females (β 0.45, SE 0.12; P<0.001).
Adult male overweight status was not
associated with change in intake of
SSSD or sweets from childhood to
adulthood. Adult female overweight
status was not associated with
change in intake of sweets, however,
compared to females who maintained
a low intake of SSSD from childhood
to adulthood, those who increased
intake were 1.9 times more likely to
be overweight as adults (95% CI 1.38
to 2.61)
Of 5 categories of energy dense
snacks, only SSSD intake at baseline
was significantly related to BMI z
score 4 years after menarche,
although the effect size was small
(compared with the group with the
lowest intake, β 0.172 for the group
with the second highest intake, and
β 0.178 for the group with the highest
intake; both P<0.001). No
associations were seen between
intake of energy dense snack and BF
(%)
Longitudinal FJ intake was not
significantly associated with BMI (β
−0.057; P=0.099), but was negatively
associated with ponderal index (β
−0.065; P=0.05)

For men, each additional daily serving
of SSB at age 13 years was
associated with greater BF (%) in
adulthood (β 1.14, 95% CI (0.04 to
2.23); P=0.04). In women, each
additional daily serving of SSB at 13
years was associated with greater
trunk fat in adulthood (β 1.62 (0.14 to
3.10); P=0.03). No relation between
SSB consumption at age 13 years
and BMI in adulthood found in either
sex
Beverage intake was measured at
baseline and at most annual follow-up
visits (visits 1-5, 7, 8, and 10).
Concurrent change in BMI was
positively associated with intake of
SSSD per 100 g/day (β 0.011 (SE
0.005); P<0.050). BMI was not found
to be associated with intake of FJ or
fruit drinks (both P≥0.05)

In unadjusted analyses, sugar intake
at baseline (% of total energy and
g/day) and beverage sugar intake at
baseline (g/day) did not differ
between people not overweight and
those overweight at follow-up.
However, beverage sugar intake (as
% of total energy) differed between
the groups (P=0.04). For intake of
beverage sugar per 1% of total
energy intake, adjusted OR for
overweight at age 8 years was 1.13
(95% CI 1.03 to 1.24)
Children who were at risk for
overweight at baseline and consumed
≥1 SSB/day were 1.8-2.0 times more
likely to become overweight than
children who consumed <1 SSB/day.
Children who were overweight at
baseline and consumed ≥1 SSB/day
were1.8-2.1 times as likely to remain
overweight than children who
consumed <1 SSB/day. There was a
positive but non-significant relation
between SSB consumption and
development of overweight in children
who were normal or under weight at

ORIGINAL INVESTIGATION

White Rice, Brown Rice, and Risk of Type 2 Diabetes
in US Men and Women

Qi Sun, MD, ScD; Donna Spiegelman, ScD; Rob M. van Dam, PhD; Michelle D. Holmes, MD, DrPH;
Vasanti S. Malik, MSc; Walter C. Willett, MD, DrPH; Frank B. Hu, MD, PhD

Background: Because of differences in processing and
nutrients, brown rice and white rice may have different
effects on risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus. We examined
white and brown rice consumption in relation to type 2
diabetes risk prospectively in the Health Professionals Fol-
low-up Study and the Nurses’ Health Study I and II.

Methods: We prospectively ascertained and updated diet,
lifestyle practices, and disease status among 39 765 men
and 157 463 women in these cohorts.

Results: After multivariate adjustment for age and other
lifestyle and dietary risk factors, higher intake of white rice
(ⱖ5 servings per week vs ⬍1 per month) was associated
with a higher risk of type 2 diabetes: pooled relative risk
(95% confidence interval [CI]), 1.17 (1.02-1.36). In con-
trast, high brown rice intake (ⱖ2 servings per week vs ⬍1

per month) was associated with a lower risk of type 2 dia-
betes: pooled relative risk, 0.89 (95% CI, 0.81-0.97). We
estimated that replacing 50 g/d (uncooked, equivalent to
one-third serving per day) intake of white rice with the
same amount of brown rice was associated with a 16% (95%
CI, 9%-21%) lower risk of type 2 diabetes, whereas the same
replacement with whole grains as a group was associated
with a 36% (30%-42%) lower diabetes risk.

Conclusions: Substitution of whole grains, including
brown rice, for white rice may lower risk of type 2 dia-
betes. These data support the recommendation that most
carbohydrate intake should come from whole grains rather
than refined grains to help prevent type 2 diabetes.

R ICE HAS BEEN A STAPLE FOOD

in Asian countries for cen-
turies. By the 20th cen-
tury, the advance of grain-
processing technology
made large-scale production of refined
grains possible.1 Through refining pro-
cesses, the outer bran and germ portions
of intact rice grains (ie, brown rice) are re-
moved to produce white rice that primar-
ily consists of starchy endosperm. Al-
though findings are not entirely consistent,
consumption of white rice, in general, gen-
erates a stronger postprandial blood glu-
cose response as measured by the glyce-
mic index (GI) than the same amount of
brown rice. A systematic review found that
the mean (SD) GI was 64 (7) for white rice
and 55 (5) for brown rice.2 Higher dietary
GI has been consistently associated with
elevated risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D) in
prospective cohort studies.3-6 In addition,
brown rice consumption may impart ben-
eficial effects on T2D risk by virtue of its
high content of multiple nutrients, such
as fiber, vitamins, and minerals, the ma-
jority of which are lost during refining and
milling processes.7 In line with these ob-
servations, high intake of white rice was
associated with a monotonically elevated
risk of developing T2D in a Chinese popu-

lation, in which white rice consumption
was the primary source of carbohydrate
(74% of dietary glycemic load).6

Compared with Asian countries, rice
consumption is much lower in the United
States but is increasing rapidly. According
to the US Department of Agriculture 2009
food supply and disappearance data, rice
consumption has increased more than 3-fold
since the 1930s to reach 20.5 lbs (9.3 kg)
per capita, and more than 70% of rice con-
sumed is white rice.8 However, little is
known about whether rice intake is asso-
ciated with diabetes risk in US popula-
tions. We therefore evaluated the associa-
tions between intake of white rice and
brown rice and risk of T2D in 3 large co-
hort studies with repeated prospective di-
etary assessments. We have previously ob-
served an inverse association between whole
grain consumption and risk of T2D in these
cohorts.9,10 In the present study, we ex-
tended the follow-up of these previously re-
ported studies and evaluated whether sub-
stituting whole grains for white rice is
associated with a lower risk of diabetes.

STUDY POPULATIONS

We used data from 3 prospective cohort studies: the Health Pro-
fessionals Follow-up Study (HPFS; age range, 32-87 years) and
the Nurses’ Health Study (NHS) I (age range, 37-65 years) and
II (age range, 26-45 years). Detailed descriptions of these 3 co-
horts were introduced elsewhere.11-13 In all 3 cohort studies,
questionnaires were administered at baseline, as well as bien-
nially after baseline, to collect and update information on life-
style practice and occurrence of chronic diseases. The fol-
low-up rates of the participants in these cohorts are all greater
than 90%.

In the current analysis, we excluded men and women who
had diagnoses of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer
at baseline for the dietary analyses (1986 for HPFS, 1984 for
NHS I, and 1991 for NHS II, when we first assessed white rice
and brown rice consumption in these cohorts). In addition, we
excluded HPFS participants who left more than 70 of the 131
food items blank on the baseline food frequency question-
naire (FFQ) or who reported unusual total energy intake lev-
els (ie, daily energy intake ⬍800 or ⬎4200 kcal/d). For NHS I
and II participants, we excluded those who left more than 10
(NHS I) or 9 (NHS II) items blank on baseline FFQs or whose
total energy intake was less than 500 or greater than 3500 kcal/d.
After exclusions, data from 39 765 (of 51 530) HPFS partici-
pants, 69 120 (of 81 755) NHS I participants, and 88 343 (of
95 452) NHS II participants were available for the analysis.

The study was approved by the Human Research Commit-
tee of Brigham and Women’s Hospital and the Human Sub-
jects Committee Review Board of Harvard School of Public
Health. The completion of the self-administered question-
naire was considered to imply informed consent.

ASSESSMENT OF RICE CONSUMPTION

In 1984, a 116-item FFQ was administered among the NHS I
participants to collect information on their usual intake of foods
and beverages in the previous year. During 1986 through 2002,
similar but expanded FFQs were sent to these participants to
update their diet information every 4 years. By means of the
expanded FFQ used in the NHS I, dietary data were collected
every 4 years during 1986 through 2002 among the HPFS par-
ticipants and during 1991 through 2003 among the NHS II par-
ticipants. In all FFQs, we asked the participants how often, on
average, they consumed each food of a standard portion size.
In the current study, on the basis of the distribution of re-
sponses to rice intake questions, we categorized participants
into 5 categories (⬍1 serving per month, 1-3 servings per month,
1 serving per week, 2-4 servings per week, and ⱖ5 servings per
week) of white rice intake and 3 categories (⬍1 serving per
month, 1-4 servings per month, and ⱖ2 servings per week) of
brown rice intake to warrant appropriate variation in rice con-
sumption while preserving enough statistical power to make
stable estimates for each category. The reproducibility and va-
lidity of these FFQs have been demonstrated in detail else-
where.14-17 In a validation study conducted among a sub-
sample of HPFS participants, assessments of white rice and
brown rice intake were moderately correlated with diet record
assessments. The corrected Pearson correlation coefficients be-
tween these 2 assessments were 0.53 for white rice and 0.41
for brown rice.14 Assessment of whole grain intake was de-
scribed in detail elsewhere.9 We considered any intact or milled
form of grain that consisted of the expected proportions of bran,
germ, and endosperm as whole grains. By definition, brown rice
is a whole grain.

STUDY OUTCOME

The study outcome was incident T2D that occurred between the
return of the baseline FFQ and January 31, 2006 (HPFS), June
30, 2006 (NHS I), or June 30, 2005 (NHS II). In all 3 cohorts,
men and women who reported a diagnosis of T2D in the bien-
nial follow-up questionnaires were sent a supplementary ques-
tionnaire to confirm the diagnosis. In this supplementary ques-
tionnaire, information on symptoms, diagnostic tests, and
treatment was collected. We used the criteria from the National
Diabetes Data Group to confirm self-reported diagnosis of T2D.18
For cases of T2D identified after 1998, we applied the American
Diabetes Association criteria.19 The validity of the supplemen-
tary questionnaire for the diagnosis of diabetes has been de-
scribed previously.20,21 Of a random sample of 62 nurses report-
ing type 2 diabetes in the supplementary questionnaire, in 61 (98%)
of them the diagnosis was confirmed after their medical records
were reviewed by an endocrinologist blinded to the supplemen-
tary questionnaire information.20 In another validation study con-
ducted in HPFS participants, 97% (57 of 59) of self-reported type
2 diabetes cases were confirmed by means of medical record re-
view.21 Deaths were identified by reports from next of kin or postal
authorities or by searching the National Death Index. At least 98%
of deaths among the study participants were identified.22

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS

We counted each individual’s person-years of follow-up from the
date of return of the baseline FFQ to the date of death, the date of
diagnosisofT2D,orJanuary31,2006(HPFS),June30,2006(NHS
I), or June 30, 2005 (NHS II), whichever came first. The relative
risks (RRs) were estimated by Cox proportional hazards regres-
sion,23 in which we stratified the analysis jointly by age in months
at baseline and calendar year to control for confounding by these
factors as finely as possible. In multivariate analysis, we further
adjusted for ethnicity, body mass index, smoking status, alcohol
intake, multivitamin use, physical activity, and family history of
diabetes. Among nurses, we adjusted for oral contraceptive use
(NHS II participants only), postmenopausal status, and hormone
use. To minimize confounding by other dietary factors, we fur-
ther adjusted for total energy intake and intake of red meat, fruits
and vegetables, coffee, and whole grains. All of these covariates
are established risk factors for type 2 diabetes and were correlated
with white rice or brown rice consumption in these cohorts.

To address missing values of dietary variables in the fol-
low-up FFQs, we replaced missing values with valid ones from
a previous FFQ. On average, 12.7% of NHS I, 11.3% of NHS II,
and 23.1% of HPFS participants had missing data after baseline
assessment. To better represent long-term diet and to minimize
the within-person variation, we created cumulative averages of
food and nutrient intake from baseline to the censoring events.24
We stopped updating diet when participants first reported hav-
ing a diagnosis of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, cardio-
vascular disease, or cancer. For these participants, we carried for-
ward the cumulative averages of dietary intake before the
occurrence of these diseases to represent diet for later follow-
up. We have used this approach in our previous studies to avoid
systematic errors in dietary assessment due to potential biased
recall after occurrence of chronic diseases.24,25 To estimate the
association of substituting brown rice intake for the same amount
of white rice, we included both white rice and brown rice intake
as continuous variables (50 g/d, equivalent to one-third serving
of white rice per day) in the same multivariate model. We used
the difference between regression coefficients for brown rice and
white rice to derive the RR measuring this association of substi-
tution. We used the same approach to examine such an asso-
ciation for whole grains treated as a single food item. This method
was used in our previous studies.26

Tests for trend were conducted by assigning the median value
to each category and modeling this value as a continuous vari-
able. To summarize the estimates of association across the 3
studies, we conducted a meta-analysis using fixed-effects mod-
els. P values for heterogeneity of study results were calculated
by using the Cochran Q test.27 All P values were 2-sided. We
calculated 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for RRs. Data were
analyzed with the SAS package, version 9.1 (SAS Institute Inc,
Cary, North Carolina). The pooling analysis was conducted with
STATA 10.0 (StataCorp, College Station, Texas).

RESULTS

We documented 2648 incident T2D cases during 20 years
of follow-up in the HPFS, 5500 cases during 22 years in
the NHS I, and 2359 cases during 14 years in the NHS II.

istics according to intake of white rice and brown rice. Men

to have European ancestry or to smoke and more likely
to have a family history of diabetes. In addition, high white
rice intake was associated with high fruit and vegetable
intake and low intake of whole grains, cereal fiber, and trans
fat. In contrast, brown rice intake was not associated with
ethnicity but with a more health-conscious lifestyle and
dietary profile. For example, participants with higher brown
rice intake were more physically active, leaner, and less
likely to smoke or have a family history of diabetes and
had higher intake of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains
and lower intake of red meat and trans fat. Both white rice
and brown rice intake was positively associated with a
higher glycemic load in all 3 cohorts.

Table 2 shows the RRs of T2D according to white
rice intake. In age-adjusted models, white rice intake was
associated with an elevated risk of developing T2D across
the 3 studies. After multivariate adjustment for lifestyle
and dietary risk factors, these associations were attenu-
ated, but a trend of increased risk associated with high
white rice intake remained. After the multivariate esti-
mates were summarized across the 3 studies, in com-
parison with those in the lowest category of white rice
intake, participants who ate at least 5 servings of white
rice per week had a 17% (95% CI, 2%-36%; P for trend
⬍.001) higher risk of developing T2D.

In contrast to white rice, brown rice intake was asso-
ciated with a lower risk of T2D in age-adjusted models
(Table 3). After multivariate adjustment for covari-
ates, these associations were attenuated but the statisti-

cal significance remained. When compared with the par-
ticipants who ate less than 1 serving of brown rice per
month, the pooled RR (95% CI) of T2D was 0.89 (0.81-
0.97) for intake of 2 or more servings per week, with a P
for trend of .005.

We observed a monotonically decreasing risk of dia-
betes associated with increasing consumption of whole
grains, including brown rice (Table 4). In comparison
with the lowest quintile, the pooled RR (95% CI) for the
highest quintile of whole grains was 0.73 (0.68-0.78; P
for trend ⬍.001). We further estimated the RRs of T2D
associated with bran and germ intake (Table 4). Bran in-
take, but not germ intake, was associated with a lower
risk of developing T2D. In comparison with those in the
lowest quintile of bran intake, men and women in the
highest quintile had a pooled RR (95% CI) of 0.76 (0.71-
0.82; P for trend ⬍.001). For germ intake, the corre-
sponding RR was 0.95 (0.88-1.03; P for trend=.40).

We subsequently examined the RR associated with the
replacement of 50 g (one-third serving) of white rice per
day with the same amount of brown rice intake. In all 3
cohorts, substituting brown rice for white rice was con-
sistently associated with a lower risk of T2D (Figure).
In the pooled analysis, each 50-g/d intake of brown rice
replacing white rice was associated with an RR (95% CI)
of 0.84 (0.79-0.91). We further examined the RR asso-
ciated with replacing 50 g of white rice intake per day
with the same amount of whole grains: the RR (95% CI)
was 0.64 (0.58-0.70).

postmenopausal status, hormone use, and oral contraceptive use were further adjusted for.

cBased on model 2, model 3 was further adjusted for total energy (kilocalories per day) and intake of red meat, fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and coffee

(all in quintiles).

Because ethnicity was associated with both white rice
consumption and diabetes risk,28 the observed associa-
tions can be a consequence of confounding by ethnicity.
However, in secondary analyses when we repeated these
associations among white participants only, we found simi-
lar results. For example, after nonwhite participants (Afri-
can American, Hispanic, and Asian) were excluded, the
pooled RRs (95% CIs) of T2D associated with white rice
intake were 1.00 (0.93-1.07) for 1 to 3 servings per month,
1.04 (0.96-1.13) for 1 serving per week, 1.10 (1.01-1.19)
for 2 to 4 servings per week, and 1.19 (1.00-1.41; P for trend
⬍.001) for 5 or more servings per week. The pooled RRs
(95% CIs) for brown rice intake levels were 0.94 (0.90-
0.99) for 1 to 4 servings per month and 0.87 (0.79-0.96; P
for trend=.003) for 2 or more servings per week. Among
white participants, the pooled RRs (95% CIs) of T2D were
0.84 (0.78-0.92; P⬍.001) for replacing 50 g of white rice
intake per day with the same amount of brown rice, and
0.64 (0.58-0.71; P⬍.001) for substituting 50 g of whole
grains per day for the same amount of white rice. When
we restricted our analysis within minority groups only, al-
though we observed largely similar results, most associa-
tions became nonsignificant because of the dramatically di-
minished power (we identified 624 cases of T2D among
9644 nonwhite participants).

When we used more recent intake of white rice or
brown rice instead of the cumulative average in the analy-
ses, the results did not substantially change. For ex-
ample, the pooled RR (95% CI) was 1.25 (1.08-1.45; P
for trend=.001) for white rice intake of 2 or more serv-
ings per week vs less than 1 serving per month, 0.90 (0.85-
0.95; P⬍.001) for replacing 50 g of white rice intake per
day with the same amount of brown rice, and 0.76 (0.71-
0.82; P ⬍.001) for substituting 50 g of whole grains per
day for the same amount of white rice. Because rice con-
sumption for most of our study participants was rela-
tively stable over time (data not shown), these results in-
dicated that the cumulative averages could better represent
long-term rice consumption because of reduced ran-
dom within-person measurement errors.24 Finally, we did
not find any interactions between rice consumption and
other diabetes risk factors, including age, body mass in-
dex, and various comorbidities.

COMMENT

In these 3 prospective cohort studies of US men and
women, we found that regular consumption of white rice
was associated with higher risk of T2D, whereas brown

bAdjusted for the same set of covariates as for model 2 in Table 2.

rice intake was associated with lower risk. In addition,
our data suggest that replacing white rice intake with the
same amount of brown rice or whole grains was associ-
ated with a lower risk. These associations were indepen-
dent of lifestyle and dietary risk factors for T2D, as well
as ethnicity.

In Asian populations in which rice is a staple food,
higher white rice consumption has been associated with
elevated risk of diabetes or metabolic syndrome.6,29,30 For
example, white rice consumption was prospectively as-
sociated with developing T2D in Chinese women living
in Shanghai.6 In addition, in Asian Indians and Japa-
nese, higher intake of refined grains including white rice
was associated with metabolic risks in cross-sectional
analyses.29,30 In comparison with Asian populations, white
rice intake in Western populations was much lower. White
rice consumption contributed, on average, less than 2%
of total energy intake in our study populations. In con-
trast, in the aforementioned Chinese female popula-
tion, white rice consumption accounted for 53.7% of total
energy intake (Xiao-Ou Shum MD, MPH, PhD, e-mail
communication).6 Likewise, according to the Japanese
National Nutrition Survey, white rice accounted for 29%
of daily total energy intake in the Japanese population.31
Consumption of rice or food groups consisting of rice
in relation to risk of T2D was also evaluated in Western
populations, but mixed results were observed.32-34 How-
ever, brown rice was not separated from white rice or other

refined grains in these studies.32-34 To our knowledge, the
current studies are the first prospective investigations con-
ducted among Western populations that have specifi-
cally evaluated white rice and brown rice intake in rela-
tion to T2D risk. In our cohorts, only 0.9% (NHS I) to
2.2% (NHS II) of total participants reported having 5 or
more servings of white rice per week (ⱖ107 g/d), which
was within the lowest reference level (⬍200 g/d) in the
prospective study of Chinese women.6 However, by pool-
ing data from the 3 studies, we detected a significant as-
sociation for white rice intake. Our data are consistent
with the Chinese study, in which white rice intake of 300
g/d or more (equivalent to 2 servings per day in our analy-
sis) was associated with a 78% increased risk of T2D in
comparison with intake levels of less than 200 g/d.6

We observed a moderate, inverse association for brown
rice intake. Because brown rice consumption levels were
rather low in our participants, we could not determine
whether brown rice intake at much higher levels is asso-
ciated with a further reduction of diabetes risk. Nonethe-
less, we found that substitution of brown rice for white
rice was associated with a significantly lower risk of de-
veloping diabetes. Consistent with our previous analy-
ses,9,10 we found a significant inverse association between
whole grain consumption and diabetes risk. Substitution
of whole grains for white rice was more strongly associ-
ated with diabetes risk than was the substitution of brown
rice. This observation may result from the more reliable

cluded multiple grains with various nutrient composi-

For example, whole wheat and barley generate lower glu-
cose response than brown rice: the mean (SD) GI values
were 41 (3) for whole wheat, 25 (1) for barley, and 55 (5)

for brown rice.2 As a consequence, in comparison with
whole wheat and barley, the same amount of brown rice
likely bears a higher glycemic load, which is an estab-
lished risk factor for T2D.35

Depending on the botanical structure, amylase con-
tents, and processing methods, both white rice and brown
rice demonstrated a wide variety of GI values,2,36-38 which
made it difficult to directly compare white rice with brown
rice for effects on postprandial glucose response.2 De-
spite this inconsistency inherent to rice GI values, in gen-
eral, white rice consumption generates a relatively stron-
ger postprandial glucose response than the same amount
of brown rice.2 This notion was corroborated by the ob-
servation that isocaloric replacement of white rice with
whole grains (66.6%; primarily composed of brown rice
and barley) and legume powder (22.2%) significantly
decreased postprandial glucose and insulin levels in a ran-
domized clinical trial.39 The high GI of white rice con-
sumption is likely the consequence of disrupting the physi-
cal and botanical structure of rice grains during the refining
process, in which almost all the bran and some of the germ
are removed.40 The other consequence of the refining pro-
cess includes loss of fiber, vitamins, magnesium and other
minerals, lignans, phytoestrogens, and phytic acid,7 many
of which may be protective factors for diabetes risk. In-
tact rice grains contain nearly exclusively insoluble fi-
ber.7 In both observational and experimental studies, in-
soluble fiber intake was consistently associated with
improved insulin sensitivity and decreased risk of devel-
oping T2D.4,5,41,42 In addition, higher magnesium intake
has been consistently associated with reduced risk of T2D
in cohort studies or improved glucose metabolism in clini-
cal trials.43-45 The combination of these mechanisms may
explain the beneficial effects of replacing white rice with
brown rice or other whole grains.

The strengths of the current study include a large
sample size, high rates of follow-up, and repeated assess-
ments of dietary and lifestyle information. The consis-
tency of the results across all 3 cohorts indicates that our
findings are unlikely to be due to chance. The current
study was subject to a few limitations as well. First, our
study populations primarily consisted of working health
professionals with European ancestry. Although the ho-
mogeneity of socioeconomic status helps reduce con-
founding, the generalizability of the observed associa-
tions may be limited to similar populations. However, the
biological mechanisms underlying the positive associa-
tions observed in both our study populations and the Chi-
nese study6 are likely to be the same in other popula-
tions. Second, because diet was assessed by FFQs, some
measurement error of rice intake assessment is inevi-
table. However, the FFQs used in these studies were vali-
dated against multiple diet records, and reasonable cor-
relation coefficients between these assessments of rice
intake were observed.14 Because we used a prospective
study design, any measurement errors of rice intake are
independent of study outcome ascertainment and, there-
fore, are likely to attenuate the associations toward the
null. Moreover, we calculated cumulative averages of rice
intake to minimize the random measurement errors
caused by within-person variation. To minimize the pos-
sibility of systemic measurement error incurred by re-
call bias, we not only excluded participants with a his-
tory of major chronic diseases at baseline but also stopped
updating dietary intake after participants reported hav-
ing diagnoses of diseases that might influence their sub-
sequent report of diet. Third, we did not perform oral
glucose tolerance tests to confirm diabetes diagnoses be-
cause this is infeasible in large cohort studies. However,
the supplementary questionnaire that we used for the con-
firmation of self-reported diabetes diagnoses has been
demonstrated to be highly accurate.20,21 Finally, al-
though we adjusted for established and potential risk fac-
tors for T2D, residual confounding is still possible.

Our data suggest that regular consumption of white
rice is associated with an increased risk of T2D, whereas
replacement of white rice by brown rice or other whole
grains is associated with a lower risk. The current Di-
etary Guidelines for Americans identifies grains, includ-
ing rice, as one of the primary sources for carbohydrate
intake and recommends that at least half of carbohy-
drate intake come from whole grains.46 Rice consump-
tion in the US population is increasing.8 However, most
rice consumption is refined white rice,8 as seen in our
studies. From a public health point of view, replacing re-
fined grains such as white rice by whole grains, includ-
ing brown rice, should be recommended to facilitate the
prevention of T2D.

Prospective Study of Dietary Carbohydrates,
Glycemic Index, Glycemic Load, and Incidence
of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in Middle-aged
Chinese Women

Raquel Villegas, PhD; Simin Liu, MD, ScD; Yu-Tang Gao, MD; Gong Yang, MD, MPH;
Honglan Li, MD; Wei Zheng, MD, PhD; Xiao Ou Shu, MD, PhD

Background: Much uncertainty exists about the role of
dietary glycemic index and glycemic load in the devel-
opment of type 2 diabetes mellitus, especially in popu-
lations that traditionally subsist on a diet high in carbo-
hydrates.

Methods: We observed a cohort of 64 227 Chinese
women with no history of diabetes or other chronic dis-
ease at baseline for 4.6 years. In-person interviews were
conducted to collect data on dietary habits, physical ac-
tivity, and other relevant information using a validated
questionnaire. Incident diabetes cases were identified via
in-person follow-up. Associations between dietary car-
bohydrate intake, glycemic index, and glycemic load and
diabetes incidence were evaluated using multivariable Cox
proportional hazards models.

Results: We identified 1608 incident cases of type 2 dia-
betes mellitus in 297 755 person-years of follow-up. Di-

etary carbohydrate intake and consumption of rice were
positively associated with risk of developing type 2 dia-
betes mellitus. The multivariable-adjusted estimates of
relative risk comparing the highest vs the lowest quin-
tiles of intake were 1.28 (95% confidence interval, 1.09-
1.50) for carbohydrates and 1.78 (95% confidence in-
terval, 1.48-2.15) for rice. The relative risk for increasing
quintiles of intake was 1.00, 1.04, 1.02, 1.09, and 1.21
(95% confidence interval, 1.03-1.43) for dietary glyce-
mic index and 1.00, 1.06, 0.97, 1.23, and 1.34 (95% con-
fidence interval, 1.13-1.58) for dietary glycemic load.

Conclusion: High intake of foods with a high glycemic
index and glycemic load, especially rice, the main car-
bohydrate-contributing food in this population, may in-
crease the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus in Chinese
women.

bohydrates in the diet,6,7 to an increased risk
of type 2 DM. Because bread, potatoes,
sugar-sweetened soft drinks, and sweets and
desserts are the main sources of dietary GL
in Western populations, it has been sug-
gested that the associations between di-
etary GI and GL and risk of type 2 DM may
differ in Chinese and other Asian popula-
tions in which rice is the major staple
food.8

Little is known about the direct role of
dietary GI and GL in the development of
type 2 DM in populations that tradition-
ally subsist on diets high in carbohydrates.
Using data collected in the Shanghai
Women’s Health Study, we prospectively
examined the relationships between
dietary carbohydrates, GI, GL, and carbo-
hydrate-rich foods with the risk of type 2
DM in middle-aged Chinese women.

tory. According to a standard protocol anthropometric mea-
surements at baseline including weight, height, and circum-
ferences of waist and hips were taken by trained interviewers
who were retired medical professionals.10 From these measure-
ments, the following variables were created: waist-hip ratio
(WHR) (calculated as waist circumference divided by hip cir-
cumference) and body mass index (BMI) (calculated as weight
in kilograms divided by height in meters squared).

Cohort members were followed up via in-person inter-
views every 2 years. The first in-person follow-up for all living
cohort members was conducted from October 10, 2000, to Oc-
tober 6, 2002. Assessment of disease outcomes was conducted
for 74 755 cohort members, with a complete response rate of
99.8%. The second follow-up survey was launched January 17,
2002, and completed November 20, 2004, with a complete re-
sponse rate of 98.7%. Only 934 participants were unavailable
for follow-up during the entire 5-year period. The institu-
tional review boards of all institutions involved in the study
approved the study protocols, and written informed consent
was obtained from all participants before the interview was con-
ducted. A total of 64 227 participants with no history of chronic
disease, which included cardiovascular disease, diabetes melli-
tus, and cancer, were included in the study.

DIETARY ASSESSMENT

Dietary intake was assessed twice, during the baseline survey
and at the first follow-up survey, via in-person interviews using
a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) designed for and vali-
dated in this population.9 The Shanghai Women’s Health Study
FFQ comprises 77 food items and food groups that include 90%
of foods commonly consumed in urban Shanghai during the
study period. Carbohydrate-rich foods included rice, noodles
or steamed bread, bread, potatoes, and sweet potatoes. For
women who developed type 2 DM, cancer, or cardiovascular
diseases between baseline and the first follow-up FFQ, only di-
etary data from the baseline FFQ were included in this analy-
sis. For other participants, FFQ data from baseline and fol-
low-up were averaged to reduce random measurement error. The
Chinese Food Composition Tables11 were used to estimate in-
take of nutrients and energy intake (ie, kilocalories per day).

We calculated dietary GI and GL based on the FFQs as de-
scribed in detail previously.6,7,12 We calculated each food’s GL
by multiplying the carbohydrate content of each food by the
food’s GI value and the average amount of food consumed per
day. We then summed these products over all food items to
produce the dietary GL. We derived dietary GI by dividing the
dietary GL by the amount of carbohydrate intake, thus estab-
lishing a weighted average of GI in each individual’s diet.6

Glycemic index values (using the glucose level as the refer-
ence) were obtained from international tables for GI values13 and
from the Chinese Food Composition Tables.11 The physiologic
interpretation of these variables has been described previ-
ously.6,7,12 To further reduce measurement error and to adjust
for extraneous variation owing to total energy intake, we ap-
plied the residual method described by Willett and Stampfer.14

PHYSICAL ACTIVITY ASSESSMENT

Detailed assessment of physical activity was obtained using a
validated questionnaire.15 The questionnaire evaluated regu-
lar exercise and sports participation during the preceding 5 years
and collected information on daily living activity such as walk-
ing, stair climbing, cycling, household activities, and daily com-
muting journey to and from work (walking and cycling). We
calculated the metabolic equivalent task (MET) value for each

activity using a compendium of physical activity values.16 One
MET hour per day is roughly equivalent to 1 kcal/kg/d or about
15 minutes of participation in an activity of moderate intensity
(4 METs) for an average adult.16 We combined each of the ex-
ercise and lifestyle activity indices to derive a quantitative esti-
mate of overall nonoccupational activity (METs–hours per day).

OUTCOME ASCERTAINMENT

Incident type 2 DM was identified through outcome fol-
low-up surveys. A total of 1608 study participants reported hav-
ing a type 2 DM diagnosis since the baseline survey. We con-
sidered type 2 DM to be confirmed if the participants reported
having been diagnosed as having type 2 DM and met at least 1
of the following criteria as recommended by the American Dia-
betes Association17: fasting glucose level greater than or equal
to 126 mg/dL (to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by
0.0555) on 2 separate occasions or an oral glucose tolerance
test value greater than or equal to 200 mg/dL (performed as
part of the participant’s primary health care), or use of hypo-
glycemic medication (ie, insulin or oral hypoglycemic drugs).
Of the participants with self-reported type 2 DM, 896 met the
study outcome criteria and are referred to as having con-
firmed type 2 DM in this report; all other participants are con-
sidered to have probable type 2 DM. We performed analyses
of both confirmed and probable type 2 DM cases and found
similar results. Thus, in this article, we present results with all
type 2 DM cases combined.

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS

Person-years for each participant were calculated as the inter-
val between baseline recruitment to the diagnosis of type 2 DM,
censored at death or completion of the second follow-up. The
Cox proportional hazards model was used to assess the rate ra-
tio of type 2 DM by intake categories of carbohydrates, GI, GL,
and specific food groups. These dietary variables were catego-
rized by quintile distribution, with the lowest quintiles serv-
ing as the reference groups. We excluded from this study par-
ticipants who had extreme values for total energy intake (⬍500
or ⬎3500 kcal/d; n=36),18 leaving 64 191 participants for the
final analysis. Sociodemographic factors and type 2 DM risk
factors were adjusted for in the analyses as potential confound-
ers. These included age (entered as a continuous variable), level
of educational achievement (none, elementary school, middle
or high school, or college), family income in yuan per year
(¥⬍10 000 [⬍$1204.80], ¥10 000-¥19 999 [$l204.81-
$2409.50], ¥20 000-¥29 999 [$2409.60-$3614.30], or ⱖ30 000
[ⱖ$3614.40]; the exchange rate for the US dollar at the time
of the baseline survey was $1 = 8.3 ¥), occupation (profes-
sional, clerical, manual worker, housewife, or retired), smok-
ing status (smoked at least 1 cigarette per day for more than 6
consecutive months), alcohol consumption (yes or no to hav-
ing ever consumed beer, wine, or spirits at least 3 times per
week), nonoccupational physical activity (quintiles of METs–
hours per day), and hypertension diagnosis (yes or no).

We conducted stratified analysis by WHR, BMI, and physi-
cal activity categories. We also defined a group at high risk for
insulin resistance or type 2 DM on the basis of the following
criteria: WHR at least 0.85, BMI at least 25, and being in the
lower quartile of physical activity METs. We then examined
the effect of dietary GI and GL according to risk status for in-
sulin resistance. The log-likelihood ratio test was used to evalu-
ate the significance of these interaction terms. All analyses were
performed using commercially available software (SAS ver-
sion 9.1; SAS Institute Inc, Cary, North Carolina), and all tests
of statistical significance were based on 2-sided probability.

RESULTS

At baseline, dietary GL was positively associated with the
intake of carbohydrates and inversely associated with the
intake of fat, protein, and fiber. Participants in the higher
quintiles of GL were more likely to be older, less edu-
cated, have a lower annual income, be housewives or re-
tired at the time of the survey, and to have ever smoked,
and they were less likely to exercise or have ever con-
sumed alcohol (Table 1). Glycemic load was also posi-
tively associated with overall and central obesity. The top
10 contributors to dietary GL in this population were rice
(73.9%), noodles and steamed bread (7.3%), sweets and
desserts (3.3%), bread (2.6%), watermelon (1.4%), apples
(0.8%), candy (0.7%), potatoes (0.6%), milk (0.5%), and
bananas (0.4%).

During an average of 5 years of follow-up (297 755
person-years), 1608 incident cases of type 2 DM were
documented. High carbohydrate intake was associated

est quintile of intake, the multivariable-adjusted RR of
type 2 DM across quintiles was 1.00, 1.13, 0.96, 1.13, and
1.37 (95% CI, 1.11-1.69) for staples. The positive asso-
ciation was evident for rice consumption, the top di-
etary GL contributor. The RR comparing the extreme cat-
egories of rice intake (⬍200 g/d vs ⱖ300 g/d) was 1.78
(95% CI, 1.48-2.15). Note that 100 g of raw rice is equiva-
lent to 250 g of cooked rice (1 cup of rice); thus, 300 g
of raw rice is equivalent to 3 cups of cooked rice and 200
g of raw rice is equivalent to 2 cups of cooked rice. In-
take of tubers was associated with a lower risk of type 2
DM. The multivariate adjusted RR of type 2 DM across
quintiles of potato and sweet potato intake was 1.00, 0.82,
0.69, 0.78, and 0.72 and 1.00, 0.54, 0.63, 0.48, and 0.51,

bohydrate intake, GI, GL, and rice intake were associ-
ated with an increased risk of type 2 DM across all WHR
and BMI categories (Table 3 and Table 4). The effect
of carbohydrate intake, GI, GL, and rice intake was slightly
stronger in participants with higher WHR and BMI. Sig-
nificant multiplicative interactions were observed be-
tween carbohydrates and BMI and between GI and BMI.
Those in the lower quartile of physical activity par-
ticipation (as measured in METs) had a modestly higher
risk than all other participants (RR, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.04-
1.30). The association of carbohydrates, rice, GI, and GL
with type 2 DM seemed to be more pronounced in par-
ticipants with low activity levels, and tests for interac-
tion were significant for GL and physical activity
(Table 5). We further evaluated dietary associations in
analyses stratified by risk of insulin resistance or type 2
DM (defined as participants having a WHR ⱖ0.85,

BMI ⱖ25, and being in the lower quartile of physical ac-
tivity METs). We found that carbohydrates, dietary GL,
and rice were more strongly related to the risk of type 2
DM in women who also had a high risk of insulin resis-
tance, although results of tests for multiplicative inter-
action were not significant (Table 6). This analysis was
adjusted for age, total daily energy intake, alcohol in-
take, smoking status, education level, income level, oc-
cupation, and diagnosis of hypertension.

COMMENT

In this large prospective study of middle-aged Chinese
women, staple foods, rice in particular, were associated
with an increased risk of developing type 2 DM. Carbo-
hydrate intake, dietary GI, and dietary GL were all posi-
tively associated with the risk of type 2 DM.

A positive association between carbohydrate intake and
glucose intolerance (determined with an oral glucose tol-
erance test) has previously been reported in a prospec-

tive study of 175 elderly Dutch men and women.19 Diets
high in refined carbohydrates may lead to hypertension,
dyslipidemia (low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol
and high triglyceride levels), and high levels of C-
reactive protein,12,20 metabolic intermediaries of insulin
resistance. Dietary GI was positively associated with a
2-hour glucose tolerance test in male participants of the
Health, Aging and Body Composition cohort study.21 High
dietary GL and GI were positively associated with sev-
eral metabolic risk factors in a female Japanese popula-
tion, in which rice is a major contributor to diet,22 as it
is in our study. High dietary GL was associated only with
2-hour incremental glucose concentrations at baseline in
the Insulin Resistance Atherosclerosis Study23 but not with
other measures of glucose metabolism at baseline or fol-
low-up or with insulin sensitivity.24 However, the FFQ
used in that study and the database used to measure GI
had low validity (r = 0.37 compared with 24-hour di-
etary recall).25

cidence of insulin resistance as determined by the ho-
meostasis model assessment scores in the Framingham
Offspring Study cohort26 and with other health out-
comes such as dyslipidemia and coronary heart dis-
ease.6,27 In a recent report from a 12-week randomized
trial of 129 overweight men and women comparing 4 dif-
ferent dietary GLs, participants in the 2 diets with a mod-
erately reduced GL were twice as likely to achieve a weight
loss of 5% or more.28 As pointed out by Liu,29 a weight
loss of 5%, although modest, was associated with a 58%
reduction in the 4-year cumulative incidence of diabe-
tes in overweight and obese men and women with im-
paired glucose tolerance.30

Whether greater dietary intake of high GI foods di-
rectly increases the risk of type 2 DM remains conten-
tious, with some studies reporting a positive association2-5
and others reporting no association.31 Differences in study
methods and rigor may be the key factor influencing the
study results. Positive associations between dietary GI, GL,
and diabetes risk have been reported in the 3 major co-
horts of primarily white participants who had high fol-
low-up rates and repeated dietary measurements, specifi-
cally, the Nurses’ Health Studies I and II and the Health
Professionals Follow-up Study.3-5 The Atherosclerosis Risk
in Communities Study found an association between GL
and type 2 DM of borderline significance after adjustment
for intake of cereal fiber.32 The 2 studies reporting a nega-
tive association, the Melbourne Collaborative Cohort Study2
and the Iowa Women’s Health Study,31 had only a single
dietary measurement. In addition, for the Melbourne Col-
laborative Cohort Study, no information was provided about
the validity of the dietary assessment, and the authors men-
tioned that the reproducibility of the dietary question-
naire used in that study was low.2 Ascertainment of dia-
betes outcome was documented to be poor in the Iowa
Women’s Health Study.31

In general, most prospective studies have reported no
association between carbohydrate intake and type 2
DM.3-5,31-33 The amount and sources of carbohydrate in-
take in previous studies, primarily of white partici-
pants, seem to differ substantially from that observed in
the present study. In our population, the amount of car-
bohydrates consumed by participants is much higher than
in previous studies of primarily white participants. For
example, the cutoff points for quintiles of carbohy-
drates were 192.1, 210, 225, and 243 g/d in the Iowa
Women’s Health Study,31 whereas in our study, quintile
cutoff points were 233.3, 261.5, 287.1, and 321.9 g/d. The
cutoff points of carbohydrates (percent of total energy
per day) in the Nurses’ Health Study I were 44.4%, 48.3%,
57.7%, and 55.9%,5 whereas in our study, they were
62.9%, 66.5%, 69.5%, and 72.9%.

In our study, rice consumption was strongly related
to the risk of type 2 DM, similar to findings of other pro-
spective studies conducted in the United States,20 but rice
consumption was not related to risk of type 2 DM in cross-
sectional data from the United Kingdom or prospective
data from Australia.2,34 In our study, potato intake was
associated with a lower risk of type 2 DM. Other studies
have reported a positive association3-5,35 or no associa-
tion,2,34,36 and another reported a beneficial effect of po-

tatoes on glucose tolerance.37 Dietary patterns in Shang-
hai, China, are different from patterns in Western
populations. In Shanghai, rice is a main staple food,
whereas potatoes are consumed as a vegetable (ie, in lower
quantities). In the Da Qing study for diabetes preven-
tion conducted in China, a diet high in fruit and veg-
etables was associated with a lower incidence of diabe-
tes.38 In our study, the median intake of raw rice was 250
g/d, contributing 73.9% of dietary GL, whereas the me-
dian intake of potatoes was 8.1 g/d, contributing only 0.6%
of dietary GL. In Western populations, potatoes are of-
ten consumed fried or with a large amount of fat and are
part of a Western dietary pattern that has been found to
be associated with a higher risk of type 2 DM.39,40 The
difference in the intake amount and preparation method
of potatoes between the Chinese and Western diets may
have contributed to inconsistent findings between our
study and others conducted in Western populations.

It has been reported that the adverse effects of a high
dietary GL are more evident in overweight or obese women,
who, it is presumed, were already more insulin resistant
at baseline.6,7 However, data on the joint effect between over-
all and central obesity and GI and GL on type 2 DM and
other metabolic risk factors for insulin resistance and coro-
nary heart disease are sparse and inconsistent.2,3,5-7,41 In the
present study, we observed a stronger effect of carbohy-
drate intake, rice intake, GI, and GL in women with higher
WHR and BMI, although results of most of the tests for mul-
tiplicative interaction were not significant. With longer fol-
low-up, we expect to have more statistical power to verify
these findings in future years.

In conclusion, in this large population-based cohort
study, we found that a diet high in carbohydrates and with
a high GI was associated with a higher risk of type 2 DM,
in particular in participants with high WHR and BMI.
Given that a large part of the world’s population con-
sumes rice and carbohydrates as the mainstay of their diets,
these prospective data linking intake of refined carbo-
hydrates to increased risk of type 2 DM may have sub-
stantial implications for public health.

Fish Oil and Glycemic Control in Diabetes
A meta-analysis

CYLLA E. FRIEDBERG, MD

ROBERT J. HEINE, PHD, MD
DIEDERICK E. GROBBEE, PHD, MD

O B J E C T I V E — H y p e rtriglyceridemia is associated with cardiovascular disease in diabetes.
Fibrates effectively lower, but do not always normalize, serum triglyceride levels. Fish oil sup-
plements may then be added to lower serum triglyceride levels. Doubt remains whether the net
e ffect of ﬁsh oil intake on glycemic control is beneﬁcial in diabetes. We there f o re perf o rmed a
meta-analysis from published clinical trials.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS — Data sources were Medline (Cologne, Ger-
many), Excerpta Medica, Current Contents, review articles, and published re f e rence lists. Pub-
lications of 26 trials were selected, and all trials included more than ﬁve diabetes (IDDM and
NIDDM) patients and addressed the effects of ﬁsh oil (eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA] and docosa-
hexaenoic acid [DHA]) on serum lipids and glucose tolerance. We (C.E.F., M.J.F.M.J.) extracted
data  independently  based  on  pre d e t e rmined  criteria.  Studies  were  classiﬁed  according  to
d e s i g n .

R E S U LT S — All studies combined showed a decrease in mean triglyceride concentrations in
association with ﬁsh oil: ⫺0.60 mmol/l (95% CI, ⫺0.84 to ⫺0.33, P ⬍ 0.01) and a slight but
s i g n i ﬁcant increase in serum LDL cholesterol: 0.18 mmol/l (95% CI, 0.04⫺0.32, P = 0.01), with
both  ﬁndings  most  prominent  in  NIDDM.  No  signiﬁcant  changes  in  HbA1 c p e rc e n t a g e s
o c c u rred in diabetic subjects treated with ﬁsh oil. Fasting blood glucose levels were incre a s e d
with borderline signiﬁcance in NIDDM subjects (0.43 mmol/l [95% CI, 0.00⫺0.87], P = 0.06)
and were signiﬁcantly lower in IDDM subjects (⫺1.86 mmol/l [95% CI, ⫺3.1 to ⫺0.61], P ⬍
0.05). Signiﬁcant dose-response effects of EPA (g/day) on HbA1 c and triglycerides and of DHA
(g/day) on fasting blood glucose levels, HbA1 c, and triglycerides were demonstrated only in
NIDDM subjects.

C O N C L U S I O N S — The use of ﬁsh oil has no adverse affects on HbA1 c in diabetic subjects
and lowers triglyceride levels effectively by almost 30%. However, this may be accompanied
by a slight increase in LDL cholesterol concentration. Fish oil may be useful in treating dys-
lipidemia in diabetes.

Debate remains about the net beneﬁt s

of  administering  ﬁsh oil to  diabetic
patients. A link between diabetes and
ﬁsh oil intake was ﬁrst proposed during the
1960s and  1970s  by  Danish re s e a rc h e r s ,
who re p o rted a remarkably lower incidence
of  diabetes  and  cardiovascular  disease  in
G reenland  Eskimos  compared  with  the
general Danish population (1,2). Bang et al.
(3)  attributed  this  to  diff e rences  in  diet:

the Eskimos consumed more ﬁsh (contain-
ing polyunsaturated fatty acids, mainly of
the ␻-3 class) and less saturated fat. Later
epidemiological  studies  in  other  popula-
tions also showed ﬁsh consumption to be
inversely related to cardiovascular mort a l i t y
(4,5) and to glucose intolerance (6).

The high cardiovascular mortality rate
in diabetes has been partly attributed to an
unfavorable lipoprotein pro ﬁle. This pro ﬁl e

is characterized by increased serum triglyc-
eride  concentrations,  mainly  of  seru m
VLDL triglyceride, and a low HDL choles-
t e rol concentration (7). Fish oil has  been
shown  to  induce  a  decrease  in  seru m
triglycerides,  sometimes  accompanied  by
an  increase  in  LDL  and  HDL  cholestero l
levels. Variable effects on glucose tolerance
have also been re p o rted; more o v e r, re s u l t s
in  NIDDM  and  IDDM  patients  seem  to
d i v e rge (8). These discrepancies may re s u l t
f rom  diff e rences  in  such  factors  as  trial
design, type of patient studied (NIDDM or
IDDM), and ﬁsh oil dosage. Reaching clear-
cut conclusions about the efficacy of ﬁsh oil
administration in diabetes is there f o re dif-
ﬁcult, and clinicians may be underu t i l i z i n g
the potentially beneﬁcial effects of ﬁsh oil.
We there f o re perf o rmed a meta-analysis to
estimate the size and direction of the eff e c t s
of ﬁsh oil administration on both glycemic
c o n t rol  and  lipid  parameters  in  NIDDM
and IDDM patients.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND
M E T H O D S

Data sources
To identify all publications containing dis-
cussions of ﬁsh oil administration to dia-
betic  patients,  we  (C.E.F,  M.J.F. M . J . )
conducted  a  computer  search  thro u g h
Medline  (Cologne,  Germany),  Excerpta
Medica,  and  Current  Contents  using  the
t e rms  ﬁsh  oil,  ␻-3  polyunsaturated  fatty
acids, and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids
in  combination  with  diabetes  mellitus,
insulin-dependent  diabetes  mellitus,  and
non-insulin-dependent  diabetes  mellitus.
The re f e rence lists of all traced articles and
most general reviews of this topic (8–13)
w e re examined manually.

Study selection and data extraction
The publications selected were of interv e n-
tion  studies  that  included  more  than  ﬁv e
diabetic (IDDM and NIDDM) patients and
that aimed to assess the effect of ﬁsh oil on
lipid  and/or glycemic parameters.  In  June
1995, this search had resulted in 61 publi-
cations (9,14–73). Of these, 36 publications
did not meet our criteria: 5 did not concern
diabetes  (9,14–17);  16  were  reviews  or

commentaries  (18–33);  2  described  the
same patients mentioned in other selected
studies (34,35); 6 had ﬁnal results missing
(36–38), had baseline (39) or postinterv e n-
tion (40) results missing, or had outcomes
that  resulted  from  two  diff e rent  tre a t m e n t
dosages used (41); 6 did not involve admin-
istration  of  ﬁsh  oil  (42–46)  or  involved
e x t e rnal use of ﬁsh oil (47); and 1 was a case
re p o rt (48). Our meta-analysis summarized
the  results  of  the  remaining  26  studies
(49–74), classiﬁed by trial design.

We  (C.E.F.,  M.J.F.M.J.)  re c o rded  the
following  characteristics  from  these  trials
i n d e p e n d e n t l y :

1 . Design  of  the  trial  (whether  trial  is
open,  single-blind,  or  double-blind;
whether a parallel-group, cro s s o v e r, or
b e f o re-after  design  was  used;  and
whether the trial was randomized).

2 . Brand of ﬁsh oil, daily dosage of eicos-
apentaenoic  acid  (EPA)  and  docosa-
hexaenoic acid (DHA), duration of the
trial  (expressed  in  weeks),  use  of
placebo, and brand and concentration
of placebo if used.

3 . N u m b e r, sex, mean age, and NIDDM
or IDDM classiﬁcation of part i c i p a n t s
in the study and which other medica-
tions, if any, were being taken by study
p a rt i c i p a n t s .

4 . Changes  re c o rded  in  the  following
parameters  during  the  interv e n t i o n
period: serum triglycerides, total choles-
t e rol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholestero l ,
fasting blood glucose concentration, and
H b A1 c.

Calculations of the changes in param-
eters depended on the design of the trial. In
b e f o re-after  trials,  the  diff e rence  between
baseline level and the end of the interv e n-
tion period was calculated. In parallel trials,
the diff e rences between the results of the
i n t e rvention  period  (before  and  after  the
i n t e rvention)  and  the  placebo  period
( b e f o re and after the placebo period) were
calculated, after which the change during
the  placebo  period  was  subtracted  fro m
that  during  the  intervention  period.  In
c rossover trials, ﬁrst the diff e rence between
the end of the intervention period and the
baseline  period  was  calculated,  then  the
d i ff e rence  between  placebo  period  and
baseline period was calculated, and ﬁn a l l y
the change in the placebo period was sub-
tracted from that in the intervention period.
About  one-third  of  the  26  selected
re p o rts did not re p o rt SDs or other meas-

u res of variance of one or more of the study
parameters.  Weighting  according  to  vari-
ance was there f o re impossible, and it was
decided to weight the studies by number of
p a rticipants.  Two  studies  (51,60)  had  a
t h re e - p a r a l l e l - g roups design. Because of the
small number of studies with this design,
no separate analysis has been perf o rmed for
these  studies, and  they  were  included  as
t w o - p a r a l l e l - g roups trials.

Statistical analysis
Data were analyzed using weighted linear
re g ression  analysis  (Stata;  Stata,  College
Station,  TX).  Because  no  individual  data
w e re available, the meta-analysis was based
on  aggregate  data  from  published  trials.
The  data-analytic  approach  was  deter-
mined by the study with the most limited
set of information. For this reason, the only
weight used in the re g ression analyses was
the  size  of  the  study (n). Mean  estimates
w e re  calculated  with  corresponding 95%
CIs. Analyses were perf o rmed for all stud-
ies combined, and separately for contro l l e d
studies  (those  with  a  double-blind,  ran-
domized,  placebo-controlled,  parallel,  or
c rossover design) and uncontrolled studies
(those with a before-after design), because
we assumed heterogeneity for the ﬁsh oil
e ffect by study design. Baseline glucose and
lipid  parameters  and changes  after  inter-
vention  were  calculated  for  the  whole
g roup,  and  separately  for  controlled  and
u n c o n t rolled  study  designs  and  diabetes
types (NIDDM and IDDM).

The effects  of  various  EPA  and  DHA
concentrations  (g/day),  diabetes  type
(NIDDM  or  IDDM),  and  study  duration
( e x p ressed  in  weeks)  on  glucose,  HbA1 c,
triglyceride, LDL cholesterol, and total cho-
l e s t e rol concentrations were examined, and
results for the whole group and the re s p e c-
tive subgroups of trials were compare d .

Trial characteristics
A summary of the design and selected clin-
ical characteristics from all 26 trials is pre-
sented in Table 1. Some clinical data were
missing, and not all study parameters were
available  from  all  included  trials.  Seru m
triglycerides were not measured in 2 trials
(59,60),  total  cholesterol  was  not  meas-
u red in 3 trials (59,60,62), LDL cholestero l
was not measured in 7 trials (52,59,62,68,
71,73,74), HDL cholesterol was not meas-
u red  in  5  trials  (52,59,62,71,74),  fasting
blood glucose was not measured in 11 tri-

Friedberg and Associates

als  (51,52,57,59,60,62,65,66,68,73,74),
and  HbA1 c was  not  measured  in  7  trials
(49,51,52,55,60,61,64). In 13 trials, tre a t-
ment allocation was randomized (49–61),
but only 8 of these trials (49–56) were exe-
cuted in a double-blind fashion.

Even  though  these  eight  studies  are
comparable in design and dose of ﬁsh oil
given (in general, ⬃1.8 g of EPA and 1.2 g
of  DHA),  they  diff e red  in  the  type  of
patients  included,  NIDDM  (49,50,52,
54–56)  or  IDDM  (51,53),  and,  conse-
q u e n t l y,  in  age of  patient and  the use  of
other  medications.  The  NIDDM  patients
w e re  treated  for  their  diabetes  with  diet
alone,  with  glucose-lowering  drugs  (sul-
f o n y l u rea  derivatives  [55]  and/or  met-
f o rmin [49,52]), or with insulin (50). One
study did not state which medication was
used (54). One study (55) used saff l o w e r
oil, and all other studies used olive oil, as
the placebo oil. In four studies (51,52,55,
56), subjects were instructed to adhere to a
diet, and their adherence was  tested, but
this instruction was not given in the other
studies (49,50,53,54).

The effect of ﬁsh oil administration on
the mean weighted diff e rences of the vari-
ous  parameters,  for  the  26  studies  com-
bined and for NIDDM and IDDM studies
c o n s i d e red  separately,  is  summarized  in
Table 2. There was no effect of ﬁsh oil con-
sumption on HbA1 c p e rcentages in either
NIDDM or IDDM subjects. Fish oil admin-
istration resulted in a tendency for fasting
blood  glucose  levels  to  be  higher  in
NIDDM  subjects  (0.43 mmol/l  [95% CI,
0.00–0.87],  P =  0.06)  and  to  be  signiﬁ-
cantly  lower  in  IDDM  patients  (⫺1 . 8 6
mmol/l  [95%  CI,  ⫺3.1  to  ⫺0.61],  P ⬍
0.05). This diff e rence in fasting blood glu-
cose responses to ﬁsh oil between NIDDM
and  IDDM  subjects  was  signiﬁcant  (P ⬍
0.01). Fish oil consumption lowered seru m
triglycerides  signiﬁcantly  by  25–30%  in
both  types  of  subjects  and  resulted  in  a
slight but signiﬁcant increase in LDL cho-
l e s t e rol levels in NIDDM subjects only.

D o s e - response  curves  were  calculated
for all studies combined and for the two dia-
betes  groups  separately.  A  dose-re s p o n s e
e ffect of EPA on LDL cholesterol levels could
be  demonstrated  only  in  all  studies  com-
bined: for every increase in EPA dose of 1
g / d a y,  LDL  cholesterol  concentrations
i n c reased  by  0.14  mmol/l  (95%  CI,
0.002–0.28, P ⬍ 0.05). In NIDDM subjects,
for every increase in EPA dose of 1 g/day, the
H b A1 c
i n c reased  by  0.38%  (95%  CI,
0.00–0.76,  P ⬍ 0.05),  and serum  triglyc-

erides decreased by 0.36 mmol/l (95% CI,
⫺0.63  to  ⫺0.09,  P ⬍ 0.05).  In  NIDDM
subjects, DHA had a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on
fasting blood glucose concentrations, HbA1 c,
and serum triglycerides: for every increase in
DHA dose of 1 g/day, fasting glucose con-
centrations increased by 0.74 mmol/l (95%
CI, 0.16–1.32, P ⬍ 0.05), HbA1 c i n c re a s e d
by 0.6% (95% CI, 0.06–1.15, P ⬍ 0 . 0 5 ) ,
and serum triglycerides decreased by 0.47
mmol/l  (95%  CI,  ⫺0.92  to  ⫺0.02,  P ⬍
0.05).  In  IDDM  subjects,  there  were  no
s i g n i ﬁcant  dose-response  effects  between
E PA and DHA and various parameters. One
study (74) re p o rted an unlikely combination
of values for total and LDL cholesterol. How-
e v e r, when this study was excluded from the
analysis for these lipid fractions, the re s u l t s
remained essentially unchanged. Because of
the  divergent  effects  of  EPA  and  DHA  in
NIDDM, and the narrow range of adminis-
t e red dosages in IDDM, no optimal dosage
of ﬁsh oil could be calculated.

A  signiﬁcant  inﬂuence  of  baseline
triglyceride level on triglyceride re s p o n s e s
to ﬁsh oil administration was demonstrated
only  when  all  studies  were  combined
(⫺0.44 mmol/l [95% CI, ⫺0.59 to ⫺0 . 3 0 ] ,
P = 0.000 per increase in baseline triglyc-
eride  level  of  1  mmol/l).  Study  duration
had a small effect, again only when all stud-
ies  were  combined;  for  every  1-week
i n c rease in study duration, triglyceride lev-
els  decreased  by  0.05  mmol/l  (95%  CI,
⫺0.10 to 0.0001, P = 0.05). The combined
results further showed a signiﬁcant incre a s e
in  LDL  cholesterol  levels  of  0.18  mmol/l
(95% CI, 0.04–0.32, P = 0.01), with non-
s i g n i ﬁcant increases in both controlled and
u n c o n t rolled trials. Neither study duration
nor baseline LDL cholesterol had a modify-
ing effect on LDL cholesterol concentration
after  ﬁsh  oil  administration.  No  effect  on
HDL  cholesterol  could  be  found  in  the
combined  studies:  0.03  mmol/l (95% CI,
⫺0.02 to 0.07, P = 0.25). No effect of ﬁs h

oil, dose of EPA and DHA, or study dura-
tion  on  total  cholesterol  concentrations
could  be  demonstrated,  re g a rdless  of
whether the results of the whole group or of
the two designs, considered separately, were
analyzed. In summary, trial design did not
result  in  signiﬁcant  diff e rences  between
m e a s u red parameters.

C O N C L U S I O N S — The results of this
meta-analysis showed no deleterious eff e c t s
of ﬁsh oil administration on glycemic con-
t rol in NIDDM or IDDM subjects. NIDDM
subjects showed a tendency to increase fast-
ing  blood  glucose  levels  whereas  IDDM
subjects  showed  a  signiﬁcant  decrease  in
fasting glucose levels. A profound triglyc-
eride-lowering effect of ﬁsh oil, most pro m i-
nent in NIDDM subjects, was conﬁrmed by
our analyses. The combined results  of  all
studies  indicate  a  slight  but  signiﬁc a n t
i n c rease  in  LDL  cholesterol  levels  but no
changes in total and HDL cholesterol levels.

The results of this meta-analysis also sug-
gest a dose-response relationship, especially
in NIDDM, between EPA and DHA on var-
ious parameters (fasting blood glucose lev-
els, HbA1 c, and serum triglyceride levels. A
ﬁsh oil dosage of 3 g/day of ␻-3 fatty acids
(1.8 g/day of EPA and 1.2 g/day of DHA)
was  most  commonly  used.  Fish  oil  con-
sumption  had  no  effect  on  glycemia  in
NIDDM in our meta-analysis and re s u l t e d
in  a  signiﬁcant  decrease  in  mean  seru m
triglyceride  levels.  These ﬁndings  suggest
that 3 g/day of ␻-3 fatty acids is a safe and
e ffective  dosage  for  lowering  triglyceride
levels  in  NIDDM.  Some  changes  in  LDL
c h o l e s t e rol  levels  were so small that  they
may  not  have  warranted  treatment,  but
when  treatment  was  indicated,  a  statin
could be given. One must consider, how-
e v e r, that results were sometimes based on
a small number of studies.

If our ﬁndings are to be accepted, we
need  to  address  some  limitations  of  the
analyses.  We  have  done  our  utmost  to
include all published studies to avoid selec-
tion bias and conﬁrm a t o ry bias (which tend
to emphasize one’s preconceived perspec-
tive). Because  heterogeneity of  the  re s u l t s
a c c o rding  to  study  design  was  expected,
the trials were classiﬁed accordingly in dif-
f e rent  design  groups  and  were  evaluated
s e p a r a t e l y.  However,  any  diff e rence  we
found between the overall results and the
results of the controlled trials was pro b a b l y
due to the small number of trials in the con-
t rolled group (n = 8) rather than to real dif-
f e rences. Despite the obvious importance of
c o n t rolled observations, no clear diff e re n c e
between controlled and uncontrolled stud-
ies could be shown in this meta-analysis of
limited size. Misclassiﬁcation of lipid levels

is always a serious problem in interv e n t i o n
trials. Variability of lipoprotein concentra-
tions can range from 5 to ⬎20% (75,76).
This variability is caused mainly by within-
person  ﬂuctuations  but  is  augmented  by
intra- and interlaboratory diff e rences. The
l a rge  ﬂuctuations  in  biologic  parameters
s e rve as a good reason to perf o rm a meta-
analysis and thus enhance pre c i s i o n .

Comparison of  our  results  with  con-
clusions  of  narrative  reviews  (8,10–13,
77,78) showed  that the latter (except  for
one  [13])  tend  to  exaggerate  the  adverse
i n ﬂuence  of  ﬁsh  oil  administration  on
glycemic control. In general, the authors of
these reviews  re p o rt  a  decrease  in seru m
triglycerides  and an increase in  total and
LDL cholesterol concentrations.

It is now well established that ﬁsh oil
induces a decrease in triglyceride concen-
trations by decreasing the hepatic pro d u c-
tion  of  VLDL  triglycerides  (79,80).  The
triglyceride-depleted VLDL particles show a
ﬂux  toward  LDL,  thereby  increasing  LDL
c h o l e s t e rol levels (81). A reduction in the
number of LDL receptors in the liver (82)
and peripheral tissues (83) also contributes
to this increase. Fish oil may also incre a s e
gluconeogenesis from glycerol, but not total
hepatic  glucose  production  (84);  conse-
q u e n t l y,  one  would  not  expect  glycemic
parameters to alter. Increased caloric intake
by  increased  ␻-3  fat  intake  (55)  may
explain  the  deterioration of  fasting  blood
glucose levels re p o rted in some studies. The
evidence for the differing effects of EPA and
DHA  on  serum  lipids  is  fragmentary.  In
most studies, ﬁsh oil is used instead of the
p u r i ﬁed components EPA and DHA. Several
studies suggest that EPA could be re s p o n s i-
ble for the lipoprotein changes associated

with ﬁsh oil consumption (85–87). In nor-
molipidemic  subjects,  EPA  decre a s e d
triglyceride levels and increased LDL cho-
l e s t e rol  concentrations  (87).  However,  in
h y p e rtriglyceridemic NIDDM subjects, pure
E PA showed no hypotriglyceridemic eff e c t
and only induced an increase in LDL cho-
l e s t e rol  (50).  Pure  DHA  did  not  show  a
hypotriglyceridemic effect in rats (88).

H y p e rtriglyceridemia is associated with
c a rdiovascular  disease  in  diabetes.  How
should it be treated? The ﬁrst approach in
the NIDDM patient should be optimization
of diabetes control with diet, exercise, and,
when indicated, oral  hypoglycemic agents
and/or insulin (89). In  the  IDDM patient,
optimization  of  glycemic  control  with
insulin  therapy  is  mandatory.  If  hyper-
triglyceridemia  is  still  present,  ﬁbric  acid
derivatives  should  be  used.  These  agents,
h o w e v e r, may not always normalize triglyc-
eride levels. Fish oil supplements could then
be added to lower triglyceride levels in both
NIDDM and IDDM patients. Nicotinic acid
is  not  recommended  as  ﬁrst-line  therapy
because it could deteriorate glycemic contro l
and the role of  acipimox  (a  nicotinic acid
analog,  not  yet  re g i s t e red  in  the  U.S.)  is
u n c e rtain.  The  combined  hyperlipidemia
common  in  diabetes  (90)  may  be  tre a t e d
with a combination of ﬁsh oil and an LDL
c h o l e s t e rol–lowering  drug  such  as  a  3-
h y d ro x y - 3 - m e t h y l g l u t a ryl–coenzyme  A
(HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor. The com-
bination of ﬁbrates plus HMG-CoA re d u c-
tase inhibitors  carries  an  increased  risk  of
myopathy (91). The combination of pravas-
tatin and ﬁsh oil has been shown during a
s h o rt - t e rm trial to be a very effective therapy
with few side effects in patients with primary
combined hyperlipidemia (92). Future trials

Diabetes and Cardiovascular Disease

Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme
Inhibitors or Angiotensin Receptor
Blockers for Prevention of Type 2 Diabetes
A Meta-Analysis of Randomized Clinical Trials

OBJECTIVES We sought to investigate the role of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and
angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) in preventing the new onset of type 2 diabetes mellitus.
BACKGROUND Diabetes is a public health problem of epidemic proportions and its prevalence is on the rise.
The typical American born today has a one in three chance of developing type 2 diabetes.
This diagnosis is associated with an adverse cardiovascular prognosis and is considered the
risk equivalent of established coronary disease. Even in high-risk individuals, diabetes is a
preventable disease. Several studies have shown that ACE inhibitors and ARBs decrease the
incidence of new-onset type 2 diabetes. However, the exact role of these agents in diabetes
prevention has not yet been fully elucidated.
We conducted a meta-analysis of 12 randomized controlled clinical trials of ACE inhibitors
or ARBs, identiﬁed through a MEDLINE search and a review of reports from scientiﬁc
meetings, to study the efﬁcacy of these medications in diabetes prevention.
This showed that ACE inhibitors and ARBs were associated with reductions in the incidence
of newly diagnosed diabetes by 27% and 23%, respectively, and by 25% in the pooled analysis.
CONCLUSIONS The use of an ACE inhibitor or ARB should be considered in patients with pre-diabetic
conditions such as metabolic syndrome, hypertension, impaired fasting glucose, family history
of diabetes, obesity, congestive heart failure, or coronary heart disease.

METHODS

RESULTS

More than 19 million adults in the U.S. and 150 million
adults worldwide have diabetes; by the year 2025, the World
Health Organization projects more than 300 million cases
worldwide (1). The typical American born today has a one
in three chance of developing type 2 diabetes; for Hispanic
and African American people, the risk is almost one in two.
For a man diagnosed with diabetes at age 40 years, the
average life expectancy is reduced by approximately 11.6
years and quality of life years by 18.6 (2). A diagnosis of type
2 diabetes carries such adverse prognostic implications
(about 70% of diabetic patients die of cardiovascular disease)
that it is considered the risk equivalent of established
coronary disease (3). Strategies to prevent type 2 diabetes
are, therefore, of paramount importance in improving the
health of the American population in the 21st century.

The recently characterized constellation of risk factors
referred to as metabolic syndrome (due to underlying insulin
resistance) is a well-recognized precursor of type 2 diabetes
(4). These patients are also at a high risk for cardiovascular
events caused by accelerated atherosclerosis, hypercoagula-
bility, dyslipidemia, and endothelial dysfunction (4). Ap-
proximately 24% (47 million) of adult Americans have
metabolic syndrome. The prevalence of this disorder is

increasing sharply and in parallel with the obesity epidemic
(5,6).

Insulin resistance plays a causal role in hypertension and
atherosclerosis, and thus is present to some degree in most
patients with these diseases. About 50% of hypertensive
individuals are hyperinsulinemic (7), and up to 75% of
people with type 2 diabetes have hypertension (8). Abnor-
mal glucose metabolism is seen in approximately two of
three patients presenting with an acute coronary syndrome
(with about equal numbers of patients having impaired
fasting glucose and overt diabetes) (9).

In the milieu of insulin resistance, the cardiovascular
system is sensitized to the adverse trophic effects of the renin
angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) (10,11), as evi-
denced by the frequent occurrence of diffuse arterial disease
and left ventricular hypertrophy in diabetic patients, even
when the lipid and blood pressure levels are normal. High
insulin levels stimulate the angiotensin I receptor, which
activates the RAAS (12) and also increases cardiac sympa-
thetic nervous system function (13). Diabetic patients, in
particular, beneﬁt from blockade of the RAAS, with reduc-
tion of cardiovascular mortality up to 40% in a major,
randomized, controlled trial (14).

Multiple large prospective trials have reported an unex-
pected reduction in the development of new type 2 diabetes
mellitus in patients treated with anti-hypertensive agents.
These trials predominantly used angiotensin-converting

enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers
(ARBs) and have consistently shown reductions in the risk
of new diabetes ranging from 4% to 87% (Table 1).

To elucidate the role of ACE inhibitors and ARBs in
diabetes prevention, we conducted a meta-analysis of all
sizable randomized clinical trials of ACE inhibitors or
ARBs that reported data on the incidence of diabetes at
baseline and study end.

METHODS

Data identiﬁcation. We identiﬁed all randomized trials of
ACE inhibitors or ARBs in which the incidence of new-
onset diabetes was reported. Candidate trials were sought
through a computerized bibliographic search of
the
MEDLINE database (National Library of Medicine, Be-
thesda, Maryland) for the period January 1990 to December
2004, and were required to include randomization in their
design. The ACE inhibitor and angiotensin blocker/

antagonist classes were searched in subject headings, and
individual drug names were used as keywords. “(Diabetes or
mellitus or glucose or insulin)” within three words of “(new$
or emerg$ or prevent$ or develop$ or risk$)” were searched
in the title/abstract/subject heading. One hundred ninety-
one articles were identiﬁed. The same search strategy was
used to ﬁnd citations in the Cochrane Database of System-
atic Reviews, ACP Journal Club, The Database of Abstracts
of Reviews of Effects, and Cochrane Central Register of
Controlled Trials (Ovid Technologies Inc., New York, New
York). One hundred two articles were identiﬁed with this
search. The reference lists of all articles obtained were
examined to identify additional trials. Abstracted studies
from presentations at national meetings were included if
they met the design criteria.
Research selection. All titles and abstracts from the search
process were examined. Studies were retrieved if they met
the following criteria: 1) randomized comparison of an
ACE inhibitor or an ARB to placebo or another anti-
hypertensive medication, 2) study duration of at least one
year, 3) all study patients had a history of hypertension or at
least one cardiovascular risk factor, and 4) the incidence of
new-onset diabetes during the study was reported in both
the treatment and the control groups (for those patients
without diabetes at baseline). We identiﬁed 13 published

studies of ACE inhibitors and ARBs (15–27). One study
(27), however, was excluded because patients were not
randomized to receive an ACE inhibitor, which was only
used as an add-on therapy for blood pressure control.
Therefore, a total of 12 studies were used in our analysis.
Data analysis. Pooled risk ratios were calculated using
random effects meta-analysis described by DerSimonian and
Laird (28,29). Risk ratios and conﬁdence intervals for a new
diagnosis of type 2 diabetes were obtained from published
sources for each of the 12 studies. Seven studies (15–
17,19,21,22,24)
studies
(18,20,23,26) reported hazard ratios, and one study (25)
reported an odds ratio. It was assumed that the hazard ratios
and odds ratio were reasonable approximations of relative
risk. The 12 estimates and conﬁdence intervals were log-
transformed, and variances were calculated assuming Wald-
type conﬁdence intervals. A pooled estimate was then
calculated as a weighted average of the log-risk ratios, with
weights inversely related to the variances (i.e., estimates
from studies with wide conﬁdence intervals received less
weight than those with narrow intervals). Because of differ-
ences in the types of drugs used, study designs, and methods,
a random effects model was chosen, which incorporates an
additional factor in the weights to account for between-study
variability. Heterogeneity of effects was conﬁrmed by the
Cochran test, p ⫽ 0.008. The variance of the pooled estimate
was calculated as the inverse of the sum of the weights, and a
95% conﬁdence interval was derived assuming normality.
Finally, the pooled estimate and conﬁdence limits were back-
transformed to the original ratio scale. Pooled risk ratios were
calculated over all studies as well as separately for ACE
inhibitors and ARB studies. Analyses were performed using
SAS version 8.2 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, North Carolina).

RESULTS

Of the 12 studies that met the criteria for entering the
meta-analysis, 7 used ACE inhibitors (15–17,19,20,24,26)
and 5 used ARBs (18,21–23,25). These trials involved
116,220 patients, of whom 72,333 did not have diabetes at
baseline. Patients included in these studies had hypertension
or at least one other cardiovascular risk factor. Two of the
trials, namely Candesartan in Heart Failure-Assessment of
Reduction in Mortality and Morbidity (CHARM) (23) and
Studies Of Left Ventricular Dysfunction (SOLVD) (24),
involved chronic heart failure patients, which is an insulin-
resistant state in which the development of diabetes is
particularly associated with increased morbidity and mor-
tality (30).

The ACE inhibitors and ARBs were compared with
placebo, diuretics, beta-blockers, or calcium-channel antag-
onists. Although the incidence of new-onset diabetes was
deﬁned differently among the trials, most used the Ameri-
can Diabetes Association criteria (31) of a fasting plasma
glucose of ⱖ126 mg/dl at two different visits in patients
with no diabetes at the time of enrollment.

The mean duration of follow-up ranged from 1 to 6.1
years. Reduction in the incidence of new-onset diabetes
ranged from 4% to 87%. In two of the studies, namely the
second Swedish Trial in Old Patients with hypertension
(STOP-2) (16), and the Study on Cognition and Prognosis
in the Elderly (SCOPE) (21), this did not reach statistical
signiﬁcance. Figure 1 shows pooled risk ratios of the
different ACE inhibitor and ARB trials shown in Table 1.
The reductions in risk of new-onset diabetes were 27% for
ACE inhibitors, 23% for ARBs, and 25% for either ACE
inhibitor or ARB (i.e., pooled over all studies).

ACE Inhibitors or ARBs for Diabetes Prevention

DISCUSSION

Recent studies have suggested that ACE inhibitors and
ARBs may play an important role in the prevention of type
2 diabetes; the current meta-analysis conﬁrms such ﬁndings.
This meta-analysis, involving 72,333 non-diabetic patients
(approximately 338,000 patient-years of follow-up), showed
that ACE inhibitors or ARBs produced a highly signiﬁcant
25% reduction (or a decrease from 17.4 to 14.3 cases per
1,000 patient-years) in the incidence of new-onset diabetes.
This is especially important because many common cardio-
vascular conditions such as coronary disease, congestive
heart failure, and hypertension are associated with insulin
resistance and increased risk for the development of diabetes
(7,8,32). Type 2 diabetes markedly worsens long-term
cardiovascular prognosis, and thus therapies to prevent this
disease are of great interest (33).

However, there are some limitations to these trials.
Important among these is the fact that only 9 (17–19,21–
26) of the 12 trials were double-blind, whereas the other 3
(15,16,20) used the prospective randomized open-blinded
end point design. The deﬁnition of diabetes differed among
the trials. Only two trials, the Antihypertensive Treatment
and Lipid Proﬁle in a North of Sweden Efﬁcacy Evaluation
(ALPINE) (22) and the Antihypertensive Long-term Use
Evaluation (VALUE) (25), included the development of
diabetes as a pre-speciﬁed end point, whereas in the others,
this end point was a post-hoc analysis. The ALPINE study
showed a remarkable 87% reduction in the incidence of
new-onset diabetes in the candesartan group as compared
with the atenolol group. However, this study only included
392 patients and was of a short duration. On the other
hand, the VALUE trial randomized a larger number of
patients, and follow-up was a mean of 4.2 years.

A similar proportion of patients in the both the valsartan
and the amlodipine arms of the VALUE trial needed
adjunctive diuretic and/or beta-blocker therapy for blood
pressure control, thus the highly signiﬁcant 23% reduction
in new diabetes cases was not attributable to increased
insulin resistance caused by other medications in the amlo-
dipine arm. The use of these adjunctive medications in some
patients assigned to ACE inhibitors or ARBs in the other
trials, however, may have affected the differences observed in
the emergence of new-onset diabetes between the treatment
groups, although the reduction of 23% in the VALUE trial
was identical to that achieved by ARBs in our meta-analysis.
The International Verapamil-Trandolapril Study
(INVEST) investigators (27) reported that in 16,176 non-
diabetic, hypertensive patients with coronary artery disease,
the incidence of new diabetes cases was signiﬁcantly lower
in the verapamil sustained-release/trandolapril strategy (7%)
compared with the atenolol/hydrochlorothiazide strategy
(8.2%) (relative risk, 0.85 [95% conﬁdence interval, 0.77 to
0.95]). Further analysis (34) of the results of this study
showed that the addition of 4 mg trandolapril to the
240-mg dose of verapamil signiﬁcantly reduced the inci-

dence of new-onset diabetes as compared with atenolol 50
mg (hazard ratio, 0.58 [95% conﬁdence interval, 0.44 to
0.78]). However, trandolapril was an add-on therapy and
patients were not randomized to receive it, therefore, this
study was excluded from our meta-analysis.

The mechanisms of action whereby these medications
prevent type 2 diabetes are speculative (24). The ACE
inhibitors not only block the conversion of angiotensin I to
angiotensin II, but also increase bradykinin levels through
inhibition of kininase II-mediated degradation (35,36). In
hypertensive rats, Tomiyama et al. (37) have shown im-
proved insulin sensitivity with enalapril through an increase
in endogenous kinins. The higher kinin levels lead to an
increased production of prostaglandins (prostaglandin E1
and prostaglandin E2) and nitric oxide, which improve
exercise-induced glucose metabolism (38) and muscle sen-
sitivity to insulin (39–41), resulting in enhanced insulin-
mediated glucose uptake. Furthermore, the peripheral va-
sodilatory actions of ACE inhibitors and ARBs lead to an
improvement in skeletal muscle blood ﬂow, the primary
target for insulin action and an important determinant of
glucose uptake. This effectively increases the surface area for
glucose exchange between the vascular bed and skeletal
muscles. Clinical evidence supporting this effect has been
provided by Morel et al. (42), who have demonstrated
improved insulin sensitivity when enalapril was given for 12
weeks to 14 obese, hypertensive, and dyslipidemic patients.
A similar effect has also been reported with captopril (43).
The protection against new-onset diabetes may in part be
related to adipocyte function. Mature adipocytes are inte-
grally involved with the RAAS. Investigators have theorized
that increased levels of angiotensin II inhibit pre-adipocyte
differentiation into mature adipocytes, and this impairs the
fat cells’ ability to store fat. This in turn results in shunting
of fats to the liver, skeletal muscle, and pancreas, which
worsens insulin resistance. Reducing angiotensin II levels
with an ACE inhibitor or blocking the angiotensin II
receptor with an ARB may promote differentiation of
pre-adipocytes to mature adipocytes, which serve as a sump
for fat. Additionally, redistribution of the lipids from the
peripheral tissues would improve insulin sensitivity (44).

Another theory relates to a possible protective effect of
ARBs and ACE inhibitors on the pancreatic beta cell
through inhibiting the vasoconstrictive effect of angiotensin
II in the pancreas and increasing islet blood ﬂow (45), which
could improve insulin release by beta cells. Telmisartan, an
ARB, has been shown to act as a peroxisome proliferator-
activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma agonist, similar to the
thiazolidinediones rosiglitazone and pioglitazone, which
preserve pancreatic beta-cell function (46). These experi-
mental and clinical studies suggest that blocking the effects
of angiotensin II (through ACE inhibition or receptor
blockade) increases insulin sensitivity, skeletal muscle glu-
cose transport, and pancreatic blood ﬂow, which may
contribute to the prevention of diabetes mellitus.

Therefore, an ACE inhibitor or ARB is a logical ﬁrst-line

anti-hypertensive agent in patients with impaired fasting
glucose or metabolic syndrome for multiple reasons, includ-
ing the reduction in risk of progression to overt type 2
diabetes. Even in patients without diabetes or metabolic
syndrome, what was previously thought to be a “high-
normal” blood pressure (120/80 to 139/89 mm Hg) is
associated with an increased risk of adverse cardiovascular
events (47). In fact, this blood pressure range is now
considered “pre-hypertension” per new Joint National
Committee 7 guidelines (48). Some of the most widely used
anti-hypertensives, particularly the traditional beta-blockers
such as metoprolol and atenolol and diuretics (in high
doses) such as hydrochlorothiazide and chlorthalidone,
worsen insulin sensitivity and increase risk of new-onset
type 2 diabetes (19). However, carvedilol, an alpha-beta
blocker with antioxidant properties, has been shown to have
neutral effects or to slightly improve rather than worsen
insulin sensitivity (49).

Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and ARBs not
only lower blood pressure but also may possess unique
cardioprotective properties (10). They improve endothelial
function and regress both left ventricular hypertrophy and
arterial mass better than other anti-hypertensive agents that
lower blood pressure equally as well (10). They also reduce
rates of death, myocardial infarction, stroke, cardiac arrest, and
revascularization procedures (10). Angiotensin-converting en-
zyme inhibitors have been shown to protect against oxidative
stress and prevent glycosylation of proteins, which may
confer cardiovascular beneﬁt (50). These agents are gener-
ally well tolerated, especially the ARBs, which have a side
effect proﬁle similar to placebo. Thus,
in patients with
conditions associated with insulin resistance, such as meta-
bolic syndrome, hypertension,
impaired fasting glucose,
family history of diabetes, obesity, congestive heart failure,
or other risks for the development of type 2 diabetes, the use
of an ACE inhibitor or ARB should be considered.

Additional trials will be needed to conﬁrm the role of
ACE inhibitors and ARBs in diabetes prevention, and no
pharmacologic agent is currently approved for this particular
indication. Prospective trials that speciﬁcally address this
issue are underway,
including the Diabetes REduction
Approaches with ramipril and rosiglitazone Medications
(DREAM) trial with the ACE inhibitor ramipril and the
Nateglinide And Valsartan in Impaired Glucose Tolerance
Outcomes Research (NAVIGATOR) trial with the ARB
valsartan. Finally, the ONgoing Telmisartan Alone and in
combination with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial
(ONTARGET) will also investigate as a secondary end
point whether it is possible to prevent the development of
type 2 diabetes by blocking the RAAS with either an ACE
inhibitor or an ARB or a combination of both. Using the
same outcomes, the Telmisartan Randomized AssessmeNt
Study in aCE iNtolerant patients with cardiovascular Dis-
ease (TRANSCEND) compares telmisartan with placebo
for individuals who are unable to take ACE inhibitors
because of intolerable side effects.

ORIGINAL INVESTIGATION

Glycemic Index, Glycemic Load,
and Cereal Fiber Intake and Risk
of Type 2 Diabetes in US Black Women

Supriya Krishnan, DSc; Lynn Rosenberg, ScD; Martha Singer, MPH; Frank B. Hu, MD, PhD;
Luc Djousse´, MD, DSc; L. Adrienne Cupples, PhD; Julie R. Palmer, ScD

Background: Previous studies of carbohydrate quality
and risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus have yielded incon-
sistent findings. Because diet is in part culturally deter-
mined, a study of dietary factors in US black women is
of interest.

Methods: We used data from the Black Women’s Health
Study, a prospective cohort study of 59 000 US black
women, to examine the association of glycemic load, gly-
cemic index, and cereal fiber with risk of type 2 diabe-
tes. Diet was assessed at baseline in 1995 with a modi-
fied version of the National Cancer Institute–Block food
frequency questionnaire.

Results: During 8 years of follow-up, there were 1938
incident cases of diabetes. Cox proportional hazards mod-
els were used to estimate incidence rate ratios (IRRs) for
quintiles of dietary factors, while controlling for life-
style and dietary factors. Glycemic index was positively

associated with the risk of diabetes: the IRR for the high-
est quintile relative to the lowest was 1.23 (95% confi-
dence interval [CI], 1.05-1.44). Cereal fiber intake was
inversely associated with risk of diabetes, with an IRR of
0.82 (95% CI, 0.70-0.96) for the highest vs lowest quin-
tiles of intake. Stronger associations were seen among
women with a body mass index (calculated as weight in
kilograms divided by height in meters squared) lower than
25: IRRs for the highest vs lowest quintile were 1.91 (95%
CI, 1.16-3.16) for glycemic index (P value for interac-
tion, .12) and 0.41 (95% CI, 0.24-0.72) for cereal fiber
intake (P value for interaction, .05).

Conclusion: Increasing cereal fiber in the diet may be
an effective means of reducing the risk of type 2 diabe-
tes, a disease that has reached epidemic proportions in
black women.

T HE PREVALENCE OF TYPE 2

diabetes mellitus in the
United States has increased
to epidemic proportions.1
Incidence rates are higher in
black than in white individuals, and black
women have twice the incidence rate of
white women.2 Modifiable lifestyle fac-
tors, such as obesity and physical activity,
play a major role in the development of type
2 diabetes.2-4 Dietary factors have also been
implicated in the etiology of the disease, but
their exact role is not clear.

Metabolic studies have revealed that
carbohydrates from different foods vary in
the rate of absorption and in effects on
blood glucose and insulin levels, indicat-
ing that various sources of carbohydrate
intake produce different glycemic re-
sponses. Results from previous studies of
the effects of glycemic load (GL) and gly-

cemic index (GI), 2 measures of glyce-
mic response to foods,5,6 on risk of diabe-
tes have been inconsistent.7-11 Cereal fiber
is inversely associated with the risk of dia-
betes in most studies but has not been ad-
equately studied in a large sample of black
women.7-12 Because diet varies across eth-
nic groups, a study of diet in US black
women is of great interest. Our aim was
to examine the association of GI, GL, and
cereal fiber intake with the risk of type 2
diabetes in a cohort of US black women.

were from across all regions of the United States. The baseline
questionnaire collected information on demographics, medi-
cal and reproductive history, weight, diet, smoking, and physi-
cal activity, and other factors.

After the exclusion of women whose addresses were judged
to be invalid, 59 000 women have been followed through bi-
ennial postal questionnaires. The follow-up questionnaires col-
lect updated information on weight, smoking, physical activ-
ity, incident disease, births, and other factors. Follow-up has
been complete for approximately 80% of the baseline cohort
for each questionnaire cycle.

The present analyses are based on follow-up from 1995 to
2003. We excluded women if they reported diabetes (n=2785)
or gestational diabetes (n=665) at baseline; if they reported can-
cer (n=1165) or cardiovascular disease (n=809) at baseline (be-
cause they may have modified their diet after their diagnosis); if
they were pregnant at baseline (n=956); if they were younger
than 30 years at the end of follow-up (n=1960); if data on body
mass index (BMI) (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by
height in meters squared) was missing at baseline (n=472); if
they did not complete the dietary questionnaire or left more than
10 dietary questions blank (n=2969); if they had implausible en-
ergy intake values (⬍500 or ⬎3800 kcal; n=2997); or if they
had implausibly low GL values (⬍45; n=3867). After these ex-
clusions, the final analysis cohort consisted of 40 078 women.

CASE DEFINITION

Each follow-up questionnaire asked about physician-
diagnosed diabetes during the previous 2 years. Incident cases
of type 2 diabetes were ascertained from the 1997, 1999, 2001,
and 2003 follow-up questionnaires. To eliminate possible cases
of type 1 diabetes, we excluded 76 cases in which diabetes was
diagnosed before age 30 years, leaving 1938 incident cases.

The accuracy of self-reported diabetes in the BWHS cohort
was assessed among a random sample of 424 participants who
reported having been diagnosed as having diabetes. They were
mailed a medical release form and were asked for permission
to contact their physicians. Once informed consent was ob-
tained, the physician was mailed a questionnaire that asked about
the diagnosis of diabetes, year of diagnosis, diagnosis method,
and medication use. Of the 424 women who were sent a medi-
cal release, 183 (43%) returned signed releases. Physician ques-
tionnaires were obtained for 142 women (78%). The remain-
ing physicians did not respond to our requests. The diagnosis
of type 2 diabetes was confirmed for 135 of the 142 women
(95%). Of the 7 unconfirmed cases, 2 were classified as type 1
diabetes, 3 were classified as metabolic syndrome, 1 involved
steroid-induced diabetes, and 1 did not involve diabetes. Of the
142 participants for whom physician questionnaires were ob-
tained, 107 reported taking medications for diabetes and 35 did
not report taking any medications. Physician questionnaires con-
firmed the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes in 101 of the 107 par-
ticipants (94%) who reported taking medications and in 34 of
the 35 participants (97%) who did not report taking medica-
tions for diabetes. Thus, BWHS participants reported physician-
diagnosed diabetes with a high level of specificity, whether or
not they took medications for treatment of diabetes.

DIETARY MEASUREMENT

Diet was assessed at baseline in 1995 with a 68-item modified
version of the short National Caner Institute (NCI)-Block food
frequency questionnaire (FFQ).14 We modified the FFQ to in-
clude food items specific to a black population based on write-in
items from our pilot study. For each food, a common portion

size was specified and the participant was asked to fill in how
often she had consumed the food in the past year and the por-
tion size of the food. The portion sizes used were small, me-
dium, and large, with the small size being half of the medium
and the large being one and a half times the medium size. The
responses for frequency of consumption ranged from “never
or ⬍1 per month” to “2 or more per day.” For beverages, re-
sponses ranged from “never or ⬍1 per month” to “6 or more
per day.” Nutrient estimates from the FFQ were calculated using
version 3.7 of the NCI DIETSYS software.15

The FFQ was validated using a 3-day food diary and up to
three 24-hour dietary recalls among a sample of 408 BWHS par-
ticipants.16 Comparisons of the FFQ data with the diaries and
recalls indicated satisfactory agreement, of about the same mag-
nitude as in studies of other populations, for fat, protein, car-
bohydrate, dietary fiber, calcium, iron, vitamin C, folate and
beta carotene: the correlation coefficients (energy adjusted and
deattenuated) ranged from 0.5 to 0.8.

For each participant, the overall dietary GL was calculated
by summing the products of the carbohydrate content per serv-
ing of the food times its GI times the mean number of servings
of food per day.6,7 Each unit of dietary GL corresponds to the
equivalent of 1 g of carbohydrate from glucose. The values of
GI and carbohydrate content for the food items were obtained
using standard databases.17 The overall dietary GI for each par-
ticipant was calculated by dividing the dietary GL by the total
amount of daily carbohydrate intake.5-7 That is, the overall di-
etary GI is the weighted mean of the GI of all carbohydrate-
containing foods, with the weight being the amount of carbo-
hydrates consumed.

Food analysis data from the US Department of Agriculture
was used to obtain cereal fiber content for each ingredient for
all grain-containing foods. Cereal fiber content per 100 g of food
was calculated after taking into account the recipe and changes
due to cooking methods for the specific food item. The cereal
fiber intake for each participant was then calculated by sum-
ming the products of cereal fiber per 100 g times the grams of
food per serving times the number of servings of food per day.

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS

Cox proportional hazards models were used to calculate inci-
dence rate ratios (IRRs), also known as hazard ratios, and 95%
confidence intervals (CIs).18 The IRRs for diabetes were calcu-
lated for quintiles of each dietary measure relative to the low-
est quintile. Person-years were calculated from the year of re-
turn of the 1995 questionnaire to the year of diagnosis of type
2 diabetes, loss to follow-up, death, or end of follow-up (March
2003), whichever came first. Dietary variables were adjusted
for energy using the residuals method19 and categorized into
quintiles based on their distribution. Covariates were in-
cluded in the Cox regression model if the literature supported
their role as confounders or if including them in the model
changed the IRR by 10% or more. Confounders included in the
regression models were age (continuous), BMI (⬍25, 25-29,
30-34, 35-39, and ⱖ40), family history of diabetes, cigarette
smoking (nonsmokers, ⬍15, 15-25, and ⱖ25 cigarettes per day),
energy intake (quintiles), total fat intake (quintiles), and pro-
tein intake (quintiles). We estimated IRRs for the association
of a particular dietary factor with the incidence of type 2 dia-
betes in 3 models: the first included age; the second added per-
sonal factors such as BMI, energy intake, family history of dia-
betes, cigarette smoking, and physical activity; and the third
added other dietary factors. Variables not found to be con-
founders included alcohol intake, magnesium intake, history
of hypertension, history of high blood cholesterol level, and
education. Similar results were obtained with and without en-

ergy adjustment, and only the energy-adjusted results are re-
ported. Linear trends across quintiles of the dietary variables
were tested by assigning each participant the median value of
the quintile and modeling this value as a continuous variable.
Proportional hazard assumptions were tested using interac-
tions between survival time and the independent variables. The
analyses were repeated separately for a BMI lower than 25 and
a BMI of 25 or greater.

RESULTS

Table 1 displays the distribution of lifestyle and di-
etary factors by quintiles of GL, GI, and cereal fiber in-
take. Women with high-GL diets were more physically
active, had a lower prevalence of obesity, and reported
lower cigarette and alcohol use compared with women
with low GL diets. Glycemic load was also positively as-
sociated with higher GI and higher intake of carbohy-
drate, magnesium, fiber, and cereal fiber and inversely
associated with total fat and protein intake. Women with
high-GI diets reported lower cigarette use and higher ce-
real fiber intake. Higher cereal fiber intake was associ-
ated with higher physical activity, lower cigarette and al-
cohol use, higher intake of carbohydrates, protein, fiber,
and magnesium, and lower intake of fats.

During 123 499 person-years of follow-up, there were
1938 new cases of type 2 diabetes. Glycemic load was in-
versely associated with risk of diabetes in the age-
adjusted model (Table 2). This inverse association dis-
appeared after adjustment for BMI, energy intake, family
history of diabetes, cigarette smoking, and physical activ-
ity. Further adjustment for cereal fiber intake, total fat in-
take, and protein intake yielded an IRR of 1.22 (95% CI,
0.98-1.51) for the highest quintile of GL intake relative
to the lowest quintile (P value for trend across quintile of
GL, .06). Glycemic index was positively associated with

diabetes risk in all 3 models (Table 2) (P value for trend,
.001). In the multivariable model that included dietary fac-
tors, the IRR for the highest quintile of GI relative to the
lowest was 1.23 (95% CI, 1.05-1.44). Cereal fiber intake
was inversely associated with diabetes risk in all 3 mod-
els (Table 2) (P value for trend, .01). The IRR for the high-
est quintile of cereal fiber intake relative to the lowest was
0.82 (95% CI, 0.70-0.96). In subgroup analysis of cases
reporting diabetes medication use, similar results were ob-
tained for GL, GI, and cereal fiber intake.

When we repeated the analyses stratifying by BMI cat-
egory (Table 3), the associations were present both
among women with a BMI lower than 25 and among those
with a BMI of 25 or greater (overweight or obese) but
were stronger in the thinner women. For example, the
IRRs for the highest quintile of GI vs the lowest were 1.91
(95% CI, 1.16-3.16) for those with a BMI lower than 25
and 1.19 (95% CI, 1.01-1.40) for those with a BMI of 25
or greater (P value for interaction, .12). Similarly, for ce-
real fiber intake, the IRRs were 0.41 (95% CI, 0.24-
0.72) for those with a BMI lower than 25 and 0.88 (95%
CI, 0.74-1.04) for those with a BMI of 25 or greater (P
value for interaction, .05).

COMMENT

In the present study, GI and GL were positively associ-
ated with risk of type 2 diabetes in US black women, and
cereal fiber intake was inversely associated. The associa-
tions were present among both overweight women and
those who were not overweight. There was an almost
2-fold increase in risk for those in the highest quintile
of GI and a 59% decrease for those in the highest quin-
tile of cereal fiber intake relative to the lowest in women
with a BMI lower than 25.

Metabolic evidence suggests 2 possible mechanisms
by which high GI foods can increase the risk of type 2
diabetes.6 First, a high-GI food produces a relatively high
blood glucose concentration and a high-insulin de-
mand. This increased insulin demand over time can re-
sult in loss of pancreatic function and eventually lead to
glucose intolerance and diabetes. Second, high-GI foods
can directly cause insulin resistance due to an increased
production of postprandial fatty acids.

Two large cohort studies found a positive association
of type 2 diabetes with both GI and GL,7,8 2 other stud-
ies did not,10,11 and 1 study observed a positive associa-
tion with GI only.9 Most of the women in these studies
were white. To our knowledge, the present study is the
first large follow-up study to examine an association be-
tween GI and GL and type 2 diabetes in black women.
In the present study, risk of diabetes was statistically
significantly associated with GI but not with GL. It can

with total carbohydrate intake. In our study, cereal fiber
intake increased with quintiles of GL, since even whole
grains (a major source of cereal fiber) contribute to the
GL. In addition, women in the higher quintiles of GL re-
ported lower cigarette and alcohol use, more physical ac-
tivity, lower BMI, and lower fat intake. The reason is that
health-conscious women tend to follow the low-fat, high-
carbohydrate diet. This may explain the initial protec-
tive effect observed for GL. However, once we adjusted
for all the aforementioned factors, the direction of the
association changed.

We were also able to examine the effect of these di-
etary factors in an analysis stratified by BMI category. A
metabolic study of fasting plasma triacylglycerol levels
in 185 healthy women indicated that GL was more
strongly associated with triacylglycerol levels in women
with a BMI greater than 25, suggesting that the adverse
effects of a high-carbohydrate diet may increase with an
individual’s degree of underlying insulin resistance.6,20
However, the 2 previous studies of GL, GI, and cereal
fiber intake in relation to type 2 diabetes that stratified
by BMI did not find a significant interaction of BMI cat-
egory and the dietary factor.7,20 In fact, one study showed
a higher relative risk for GL in the lower BMI group.7 This
is consistent with our finding of a stronger association
of GL and cereal fiber intake in women with a BMI lower
than 25. One possible explanation is that obesity is such
a strong risk factor for type 2 diabetes that it may be dif-
ficult to detect the effects of other factors in obese women.
It is also possible that the differences in the IRRs in those
with a BMI lower than 25 and a BMI of 25 or greater may
be simply due to chance. These results should not be taken
to mean that overweight and obese women should not
reduce their consumption of refined carbohydrates for
prevention of diabetes.

Fiber has been shown to decrease postprandial glu-
cose and insulin concentrations in individuals with and
without diabetes.21 The effect of fiber is attributed to
soluble fiber that creates a gel-like substance in the stom-
ach and slows the absorption of food. However, most stud-
ies have found that insoluble fiber and not soluble fiber
is inversely related to diabetes. Insoluble fiber may lower
the amount of carbohydrates absorbed, leading to a lower
insulin demand and therefore a lower risk of diabetes.12
Previous studies on cereal fiber have all indicated that
increased cereal fiber intake is inversely associated with
the risk of diabetes in both men and women.7-12 The only
study of cereal fiber and diabetes that included appre-
ciable numbers of African Americans found an inverse
association, but the association was not statistically sig-
nificant.10 Our study, with greater statistical power, shows
that cereal fiber intake is inversely associated with the
risk of diabetes in black women.

Food frequency questionnaires have been used to mea-
sure diet in prospective studies with some success.22 Our
validation study of the FFQ used in the present study in-
dicated that dietary intake measured by the FFQ was sig-
nificantly correlated with diet measured using diet re-
calls and diaries.16

A main strength of this study is the prospective study
design, which eliminates the potential for recall bias. The

follow-up rates for each biennial questionnaire period were
high and reduced the likelihood of bias resulting from
differential loss related to both exposure and outcome.
Important confounding factors were taken into account
in the analysis. Body mass index, a strong risk factor for
type 2 diabetes in this population and the strongest con-
founder of the associations found in our study, was closely
controlled. The associations of GI and cereal fiber in-
take with risk of type 2 diabetes were present even in the
leanest women (BMI ⬍25), among whom there would
be minimal residual confounding by BMI.

The identification of cases of diabetes in the present study
was based on self-reports. A validation study indicated that
diabetes was reported with a high degree of specificity,
whether or not diabetes medications were used. We can-
not rule out the possibility that some women with undi-
agnosed diabetes were misclassified as noncases, but the
prevalence of undiagnosed disease was likely to be low.
The prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes among US black
women ranged from 1.7% in those aged 20 to 39 years to
8.5% in those aged 60 to 74 years based on national sur-
vey data from the Third National Health and Nutrition Ex-
amination Survey (1988-1994).23 Because diabetes is known
to disproportionately affect the US black population, it
seems likely that BWHS participants were screened for the
disease during the course of regular checkups. In general,
access to health care is good among BWHS participants,
with 93% reporting that they had health insurance in 1997,
91% reporting having received a Papanicolaou test in the
past 2 years, and 98% reporting that they had visited a phy-
sician or hospital in the past 2 years. Therefore, it is un-
likely that undiagnosed diabetes is a major problem.

The BWHS participants are from across the United
States, and 97% of the participants have a high school or
higher level of education. Among the US black female
population of the same ages, 83% have at least a high
school education.24 In this respect, our results should be
applicable to most US black women, except the approxi-
mately 17% who have not completed high school.

Our results indicate that black women can reduce their
risk of diabetes by eating a diet that is high in cereal fi-
ber. In the BWHS, women in the highest quintile of ce-
real fiber intake (ⱖ5.9 g/d) had an 18% reduction in risk
of type 2 diabetes. Incorporating fiber sources into the
diet is relatively easy: a simple change from white bread
(2 slices provides 1.2 g of fiber) to whole wheat bread (2
slices provides 3.8 g of fiber) or substituting a cup of rai-
sin bran (5.0-8.0 g of fiber) or oatmeal (4.0 g of fiber)
for a cup of corn chex (0.5 g of fiber) or rice chex (0.3 g
of fiber) will move a person from a low fiber intake cat-
egory to a moderate intake category, with a correspond-
ing 10% reduction in risk.25 The substitution of these
whole grain foods may have additional benefits owing
to other nutrient components such as magnesium.26,27 The
findings from this study have implications for primary
prevention of a disease that has reached epidemic pro-
portions among black women.

ABSTRACT
Background: Although ﬁsh intake can improve glucose metabo-
lism, results of some prospective studies in Western populations
suggest potential adverse effects of environmental contaminants in
ﬁsh on type 2 diabetes risk. However, data from populations with
high ﬁsh consumption are scarce.
Objective: We prospectively investigated the association between
ﬁsh intake and type 2 diabetes risk in Japanese adults.
Design: The participants were 22,921 men and 29,759 women aged
45–75 y who completed a questionnaire of the second survey for the
Japan Public Health Center–based Prospective Study and who had no
history of diabetes. Diet was ascertained by using a 147-item food-
frequency questionnaire. ORs of self-reported, physician-diagnosed
type 2 diabetes over 5 y were estimated by using logistic regression.
Results: During the 5-y period, 971 new cases (572 men and 399
women) of type 2 diabetes were self-reported. In men, ﬁsh intake
was signiﬁcantly associated with a decreased risk of type 2 diabetes;
multivariable-adjusted ORs of type 2 diabetes for the highest com-
pared with the lowest quartile of intake were 0.73 (95% CI: 0.54,
1.00; P-trend = 0.04) for total ﬁsh and seafood and 0.68 (95% CI:
0.50, 0.92; P-trend = 0.016) for small and medium ﬁsh (horse
mackerel and sardine, saury and mackerel, and eel). Additional
analysis by fat content of ﬁsh did not detect any signiﬁcant associ-
ation for each category. In women, ﬁsh intake was not appreciably
associated with type 2 diabetes risk.
Conclusion: In a population with high ﬁsh and seafood intake, ﬁsh
consumption was associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes in
men but not in women.

INTRODUCTION

Fish and omega-3 (n23) fatty acid intakes are thought to
prevent cardiovascular disease (1, 2). Data from an ecologic
study suggest that ﬁsh intake may also play a role in the pre-
vention of type 2 diabetes (3), which is supported by an animal
experiment showing a favorable effect of long-chain omega-3
fatty acids, which are abundant in ﬁsh, on insulin resistance (4).
However, epidemiologic data are conﬂicting. Of 6 prospective
studies in Western populations (5–10), 2 have shown a pro-
tective association of ﬁsh intake with type 2 diabetes (8) and
glucose intolerance (6), whereas 3 recent studies have reported
an increased risk of type 2 diabetes associated with ﬁsh intake
(5, 7, 10), which the authors ascribed to potential adverse effects
of selenium, mercury, or other environmental contaminants in

ﬁsh. To our knowledge, no study has examined the association
of ﬁsh intake with type 2 diabetes in Japanese, who consume
large amounts of ﬁsh; ﬁsh and shellﬁsh supply 61 and 20–25 kg/
capita annually in Japan and Western countries, respectively
(11). The aim of this study was to assess prospectively the as-
sociation between ﬁsh intake and type 2 diabetes risk by using
data from a large-scale, population-based cohort study in Japan.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS

Study population

The Japan Public Health Center–based Prospective (JPHC)
Study was launched in 1990 for cohort I and in 1993 for cohort II
(12). The participants of cohort I included residents aged 40–59 y
in 5 Japanese public health center areas (Iwate, Akita, Nagano,
Okinawa, and Tokyo); the participants of cohort II included res-
idents aged 40–69 y in 6 public health center areas (Ibaraki,
Niigata, Kochi, Nagasaki, Okinawa, and Osaka). Although we
did not require written informed consent, the study participants
were informed of the objectives of the study, and participants who
responded to the questionnaire survey were considered to have
consented to participate in the survey. A questionnaire survey was
conducted at baseline (in 1990 for cohort I and in 1993 for cohort
II), at the 5-y follow-up (in 1995 for cohort I and in 1998 for
cohort II), and at the 10-y follow-up (in 2000 for cohort I and in

FISH INTAKE AND TYPE 2 DIABETES

885

2003 for cohort II). Information on medical histories and health-
related lifestyle, smoking, drinking, and dietary habits was obtained
at each survey. This study was approved by the Institutional Review
Board of the National Cancer Center of Japan.

From the study population at baseline (n = 140,420), 113,403
participants responded to the questionnaire survey at baseline.
Of these, 89,947 participants responded to the 5-y follow-up
survey (second survey), including the diet-related portion. We
excluded 14,359 participants who reported a history of type 2
diabetes (n = 6816) or severe disease (n = 8680), including
cancer, cerebrovascular disease, myocardial infarction, chronic
liver disease, and renal disease at the second survey. Then, we
excluded 14,166 participants who had missing information on
ﬁsh consumption of 1 out of 19 ﬁsh/seafood items and 511
participants who reported extreme total energy intakes (ie,
outside the mean 6 3 SD according to sex). Finally, we ex-
cluded 8231 participants, including 1364 participants who died
before the 10-y follow-up survey, who did not respond to the
subsequent 10-y follow-up survey (third survey), which left
a total of 52,680 participants (22,921 men and 29,759 women)
in our analysis.

Food-frequency questionnaire

At the baseline, second, and third surveys, participants com-
pleted a self-administered questionnaire. In the current analysis,
data from the second survey were used as baseline survey data,
because the questionnaire used for the second survey more
comprehensively inquired about food intakes than did that used
for the baseline survey. At the second survey, a food-frequency
questionnaire (FFQ) was used to assess the average intake of 147
food and beverage items, including 19 items of ﬁsh/seafood
[7 fresh ﬁsh: salmon, skipjack/tuna, cod/ﬂatﬁsh, sea bream, horse
mackerel/sardine, saury/mackerel, and eel; 5 seafood other than
ﬁsh: squid, octopus, shrimp, clam, and pond snail; 4 salted and
dried ﬁsh products: salted ﬁsh, dried ﬁsh, dried whitebait, and
salted ﬁsh roe; 3 other ﬁsh products: canned tuna; and 2 items of
ﬁsh-paste products (chikuwa and kamaboko)] over the previous
year (13). For most food items, 9 response options were available
to describe consumption frequency, ranging from rarely (, 1 time/
mo) to 7 times/d. A standard portion size was speciﬁed for each
food, and respondents were asked to denote their usual portion
size from 3 options (0.5 times, standard, or 1.5 times). The
daily intake of ﬁsh/seafood was calculated by multiplying daily
consumption frequency by the typical portion size.

We examined the validity and reproducibility of the FFQ in
a subsample of the participants in the JPHC Study cohort I and
cohort II (215 men and women in cohort I and 350 men and
women in cohort II for validity; 209 men and women in cohort
I and 289 men and women in cohort II for reproducibility).
Details of the validation study were described elsewhere (14–
17). The participants completed both FFQs at a 1-y interval and
a total of 28- or 14-d dietary records. For validity of the FFQ,
Spearman’s correlation coefﬁcients between intake values for
ﬁsh/seafood derived from the FFQ and those derived from
dietary records were 0.29–0.46 for cohorts I and II (14, 16).
With regard to the reproducibility of the FFQ, Spearman’s
correlation coefﬁcients for intake of ﬁsh/seafood derived from
the 2 FFQs administered 1 y apart were 0.58–0.65 for cohorts I
and II (14, 15).

Ascertainment of type 2 diabetes

Type 2 diabetes newly diagnosed during the 5-y period after the
second survey was determined by a self-administered question-
naire at the third survey. At the third survey, study participants were
asked if they had ever been diagnosed with diabetes, and, if so,
when the initial diagnosis had been made. Because the second
survey was used as the starting point of observation for the in-
cidence of type 2 diabetes, only those participants with diabetes
diagnosed after 1995 for cohort I and after 1998 for cohort II were
regarded as incident cases during follow-up. Details regarding
assessment of the validity of self-reported diabetes are described
elsewhere (18). In a previous study that we conducted, 94% of
self-reported diabetes cases were conﬁrmed as such by medical
records. We also conducted a cross-sectional survey in 1990 to
examine the sensitivity of diagnosed diabetes according to the
criteria at that time for a JPHC subpopulation (health check-up
participants) whose plasma glucose data were available (18). Of
6118 participants with plasma glucose data, 248 participants had
diagnosed diabetes. Of 5870 participants who did not have di-
agnosed diabetes, 49 participants (0.83%) had diabetes based on
the commonly used diagnostic standards in Japan in 1990 [fast-
ing plasma glucose 7.8 mmol/L; casual plasma glucose 11
mmol/L (19)] based on a single measurement. Taking into ac-
count the abovementioned positive predictive value, the sensi-
tivity and speciﬁcity of diagnosed diabetes were 85.5% and
99.7, respectively, in men and 79.3% and 99.7%, respectively, in
women.

Statistical analysis

Participants were classiﬁed into quartiles of ﬁsh/seafood in-
take by sex. The confounding variables considered were as
follows: age (y, continuous), study area (11 areas), BMI (,21,
21–22.9, 23–24.9, 25–26.9, or 27; in kg/m2), smoking status
(lifetime nonsmoker, former smoker, or current smoker with a
consumption of either ,20 or 20 cigarettes/d), alcohol con-
sumption (nondrinker, occasional drinker, or drinker with a con-
sumption of ,150, 150–299, 300–449, or 450 g ethanol/wk for
men and ,150 or 150 g ethanol/wk for women), family his-
tory of diabetes mellitus (yes or no), total physical activity
(metabolic equivalent task hours/d, quartiles), history of hyper-
tension (yes or no), total energy intake (kcal/d, continuous),
coffee consumption (almost never or ,1, 1, or 2 cups/d; 1 cup =
120 mL), and intakes of calcium (mg/d, continuous), magnesium
(mg/d, continuous), dietary ﬁber (g/d, continuous), vegetables
(g/d, continuous), fruit (g/d, continuous), meat (g/d, continuous),
and rice (g/d, continuous). An indicator variable for missing data
were created for each covariate. Trend associations between
confounding factors and ﬁsh/seafood intake were tested by using
a Mantel-Haenszel chi-square test for categorical variables and
linear regression analysis for continuous variables.

Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to estimate
odds ratios of type 2 diabetes for the quartiles of intakes of total
ﬁsh/seafood, fresh ﬁsh, seafood other than ﬁsh, salted and dried ﬁsh
products, and other ﬁsh products, with the lowest category as the
reference. The ﬁrst model was adjusted for age and study area,
and the second model was additionally adjusted for BMI, smok-
ing status, alcohol consumption, family history of diabetes melli-
tus, total physical activity, history of hypertension, total energy

intake, coffee consumption, and intakes of calcium, magnesium,
dietary ﬁber, vegetable, fruit, meat, and rice. Trend association was
assessed by assigning the ordinal numbers 0–3 to the 4 categories of
each ﬁsh/seafood consumption. Because big ﬁsh, which are in
a higher rank of the food chain, are likely have higher concentra-
tions of environmental contaminants (2) and oily ﬁsh also might
have higher fat-soluble environmental contaminants, fresh ﬁsh was
also analyzed separately by size (big ﬁsh: salmon, skipjack/tuna,
cod/ﬂatﬁsh, and sea bream; small and medium ﬁsh: horse mackerel/
sardine, saury/mackerel, and eel) and fat content (oily ﬁsh: salmon,
horse mackerel/sardine, saury/mackerel, eel, and sea bream; lean
ﬁsh: skipjack/tuna and cod/ﬂatﬁsh). An interaction term was created
by multiplying each ﬁsh/seafood intake (g/d, continuous) and
sex and added to the model to assess statistical interactions. Two-
sided P values ,0.05 were regarded as signiﬁcant. All analyses
were performed by using SAS version 9.1 (SAS Institute, Cary,
NC).

RESULTS

During the 5-y period, 971 participants had newly diagnosed
diabetes (572 men and 399 women). Total ﬁsh/seafood intake was
positively associated with age in men and with BMI in women
(Table 1). Both men and women with a higher total ﬁsh/seafood
intake were more likely to be physically active, to be an alcohol
drinker, and to consume more magnesium, vitamin D, and
polyunsaturated fatty acids but less coffee. Of the 19 ﬁsh/sea-
food items, the major sources of total ﬁsh/seafood intake were
skipjack/tuna (12.7%), horse mackerel/sardine (11.8%), salted
ﬁsh (11.5%), saury/mackerel (11.4%), and salmon (9.3%) in
men and horse mackerel/sardine (12.8%),
saury/mackerel
(11.8%), salted ﬁsh (11.4%), skipjack/tuna (10.1%), and salmon
(9.6%) in women.

In men, total ﬁsh/seafood intake was signiﬁcantly associated
with a decreased risk of type 2 diabetes; the multivariate-adjusted
odds ratio for type 2 diabetes for the highest compared with the
lowest quartile of intake was 0.73 (95% CI: 0.54, 1.00; P-trend =
0.04) (Table 2). Additional adjustment of vitamin D or poly-
unsaturated fatty acids intake attenuated the association; the
multivariate-adjusted odds ratios for type 2 diabetes for the
highest compared with lowest quartile of intake were 0.81 (95%
CI: 0.55, 1.20; P-trend = 0.26) after additional adjustment of
vitamin D and 0.78 (95% CI: 0.56, 1.09; P-trend = 0.13) after
additional adjustment of polyunsaturated fatty acids. Intake of
each of the 4 categories of ﬁsh/seafood (fresh ﬁsh, seafood other
than ﬁsh, salted and dried ﬁsh products, and other ﬁsh products)
was not statistically signiﬁcantly associated with type 2 diabetes
risk. Moreover, when we examined the association between shellﬁsh
(including shrimp, clam, and pond snail) and type 2 diabetes, no
signiﬁcant association was observed; the multivariate-adjusted
odds ratios (95% CI) of type 2 diabetes for the lowest through
the highest quartile category of intake were 1.00 (reference), 1.10
(0.88, 1.38), 0.94 (0.71, 1.26), and 0.97 (0.75, 1.27) (P-trend =
0.57) in men. In women, any kind of ﬁsh/seafood intake was not
associated with type 2 diabetes risk.

In the analysis by ﬁsh size, small and medium ﬁsh intake was
signiﬁcantly associated with a decreased risk of type 2 diabetes in
men (P-trend = 0.02) (Table 3), whereas big ﬁsh was not as-
sociated with type 2 diabetes. The association of small and
medium ﬁsh intake with type 2 diabetes was marginally signi-

ﬁcant after further adjustment for vitamin D or polyunsaturated
fatty acids; the multivariate-adjusted odds ratios for the highest
compared with the lowest quartile of intake were 0.72 (95% CI:
0.52, 1.00; P-trend = 0.065) after additional adjustment of vi-
tamin D and 0.72 (95% CI: 0.52, 0.98; P-trend = 0.050) after
additional adjustment of polyunsaturated fatty acids. In men,
type 2 diabetes risk tended to decrease with oily ﬁsh intake
(P-trend = 0.10), but not with lean ﬁsh intake. In women, no
signiﬁcant association was observed between ﬁsh intake and
type 2 diabetes in analyses by the size or fat content of fresh ﬁsh.
Moreover, when we assessed the association between small and
medium ﬁsh or oily ﬁsh intake and type 2 diabetes risk in women
using a linear spline regression with 3 knots (which corresponds
to the quartiles) to detect nonlinearity or U-shaped association,
the associations between their intake and type 2 diabetes risk were
not U-shaped.

DISCUSSION

In this large-scale population-based prospective study in
Japanese adults, total ﬁsh/seafood and small and medium ﬁsh
(horse mackerel/sardine, saury/mackerel, and eel) intakes were
signiﬁcantly associated with a decreased risk of type 2 diabetes in
Japanese men. An unfavorable effect of ﬁsh intake on type 2
diabetes was not observed. To our knowledge, this was the ﬁrst
study to examine the association of ﬁsh intake with type 2 di-
abetes in an Asian population.

An inverse association of ﬁsh intake with risk of type 2 di-
abetes (8) or glucose intolerance (6) has also been reported in 2,
but not in all, prospective studies (5, 7, 9, 10). Fish, especially oily
ﬁsh, is a major dietary source of n23 fatty acids and vitamin D,
and these nutrients have been reported to decrease the risk of
type 2 diabetes (20, 21). In a study in the United Kingdom (8),
an inverse association was observed not only for oily ﬁsh intake
but also for white (likely nonoily) ﬁsh intake. In the current
study, although the inverse association between total ﬁsh/sea-
food intake and type 2 diabetes was attenuated after adjustment
for vitamin D and polyunsaturated fatty acids, oily ﬁsh was not
signiﬁcantly associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes. The
decreased risk of type 2 diabetes associated with ﬁsh intake
might be ascribed not only to vitamin D and polyunsaturated
fatty acids but also to other components such as ﬁsh protein or
the synergistic effect of several nutrients contained.

Three studies in the Netherlands (10) and in the United States
(5, 7) recently reported an increased risk of type 2 diabetes
associated with ﬁsh intake. Environmental contaminants such as
dioxins in ﬁsh have been suggested to increase the risk of type 2
diabetes (22) through the inhibition of glucose uptake (23) and
alterations in the insulin signaling pathway (24). In a Japanese
population with much higher ﬁsh intakes than Western pop-
ulations (25, 26), however, we observed no increase in the risk of
type 2 diabetes with intake of not only total ﬁsh/seafood but also
big ﬁsh, which are in a higher rank of the food chain and are thus
likely to have higher concentrations of environmental contam-
inants. This result suggests that overall ﬁsh intake does not confer
type 2 diabetes risk of Japanese population; conversely, it was
associated with decreased risk, as discussed above. However,
a possibility remains that the null association for big ﬁsh intake
was a result of relatively high levels of environmental contaminants,
such as mercury and organochlorine pollutants, which have been

NANRI ET AL

associated with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes (22, 27) and
thus may have diminished the antidiabetic effects of ﬁsh. Sim-
ilarly, we speculated that the null ﬁnding in women in the current
study may have been due to their relatively high proportion of
body fat mass, which may have been responsible for higher levels
of accumulation of fat-soluble chemicals, which negated the
beneﬁt of ﬁsh intake on glucose metabolism.

The effect of ﬁsh intake on glucose metabolism may differ
according to cooking method. Compared with raw ﬁsh, deep-
fried ﬁsh intake is associated with higher concentrations of
contaminants (28) and, because of a reduction in eicosapentae-
noic and docosahexaenoic acids, has a lower potential for fa-
vorable health effects (29). Patel et al (8) observed an inverse
association of type 2 diabetes with nonfried (fresh, frozen, or
canned) ﬁsh intake, but not with fried ﬁsh. Although we did not
have dietary intake data by cooking method, we conﬁrmed that
the current participants used grilling (58.9%) and stewing
(26.4%) much more commonly than frying (3.9%) as methods for
cooking seafood. The high consumption of nonfried ﬁsh in
Japanese might partly account for the inverse association between
ﬁsh intake and type 2 diabetes in the current study. Salting and
drying, which are used to preserve ﬁsh, can also modify the
association between ﬁsh intake and risk of type 2 diabetes. A salty
diet could deteriorate insulin metabolism (30), and the drying of
ﬁsh may accelerate the oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids,
which in turn induce inﬂammation (31)—a known predictor of
type 2 diabetes (32). In the current study, however, a high intake
of salted and dried ﬁsh was associated with neither an increased
nor a decreased risk of type 2 diabetes. These results may imply
that the salting and drying of ﬁsh diminishes, or even surpasses,
favorable effects that fresh ﬁsh have on glucose metabolism.

The strengths of the current study include our large sample
size, the population-based prospective design, and the use of
a validated FFQ. Furthermore, the dietary data of the Japanese
population allowed us to assess any potential association at
relatively high ﬁsh/seafood intakes, and we examined the as-
sociation by size and fat content of ﬁsh. Our study also had some
limitations. First, we had no source of information other than the
questionnaire for type 2 diabetes. However, a validation study
conducted in our study population showed fairly good agreement
between self-reported diabetes and diabetes, as documented in
medical records (94%), and the sensitivity of self-reported di-
abetes was reasonably high (83%). Nevertheless, the 5-y in-
cidence of type 2 diabetes in the current study (1.8%) was lower
than that in another Japanese study (33), which ascertained type 2
diabetes by the same method during the same period as in the
current study. If we could have conﬁrmed new cases of type 2
diabetes by using another method, such as the measurement of
plasma glucose concentrations, the incidence of type 2 diabetes
might have been higher. However, it may not be feasible to
measure plasma glucose in a large sample. Although case as-
certainment based on self-reporting might underestimate the
incidence of type 2 diabetes, this misclassiﬁcation would occur
virtually independent of ﬁsh intake and thus might not cause
serious bias in our estimate. However, we cannot rule out the
possibility that participants with higher ﬁsh intakes are more
health conscious than are those with lower intakes. Second, in the
current study, a large number of participants were excluded
because of a lack of response to the third survey, history of type 2
diabetes and severe disease, and missing information on ﬁsh/

seafood intake. For the current analysis, although these exclu-
sions were necessary, we could not rule out the possibility of
selection bias as a result of these exclusions. Third, because we
excluded participants who had missing values for 1 of 19 ﬁsh/
seafood items, a large number of participants were excluded.
However, the ﬁndings were similar to those obtained in partic-
ipants with dietary information necessary for the analysis of
each subcategory of ﬁsh intake. Fourth, dietary intakes assessed
at only one time point may not reﬂect long-term intake. Re-
peated assessment of diet over a long period of time before
disease onset will likely provide a better estimate of exposure
status. Fifth, because we had no information about potential
toxins from ﬁsh, we could not directly examine the association
between environmental contaminants from ﬁsh and type 2 di-
abetes risk. Finally, we cannot rule out the possibility of un-
measured and residual confounding.

In conclusion, total ﬁsh/seafood and small and medium ﬁsh
intakes were associated with a decreased risk of type 2 diabetes in
men. Fish intake was not associated with an increased risk of type
2 diabetes in either men or women. The current study provides
evidence to support a protective role of ﬁsh intake against type 2
diabetes in Japanese men. Biological mechanisms underlying the
inverse association between ﬁsh intake and type 2 diabetes need
to be clariﬁed.

Abstract
Objective: To study the relationship between dietary intake and the development
of type 2 diabetes among Chinese adults.
Design: A prospective cohort study. Dietary assessment was carried out using a
validated FFQ. Principal component analysis was used to identify dietary patterns.
Dietary glycaemic load and variety of snacks were also calculated.
Setting: A hospital-based centre at the Queen Mary Hospital in Hong Kong SAR,
China.
Subjects: A total of 1010 Chinese adults aged 25–74 years who participated in a
territory-wide dietary and cardiovascular
risk factor prevalence survey in
1995–1996 were followed up for 9–14 years for the development of diabetes.
Results: A total of 690 (68?3 %) individuals completed follow-up during 2005–2008
and seventy-four cases of diabetes were identiﬁed over the follow-up period.
Four dietary patterns were identiﬁed (‘more snacks and drinks’, ‘more vegetables,
fruits and ﬁsh’, ‘more meat and milk products’ and ‘more reﬁned grains’). After
adjustment for age, sex, BMI, waist-to-hip ratio, smoking, alcohol intake, parti-
cipation in exercise/sports and family history of diabetes, the more vegetables,
fruits and ﬁsh pattern was associated with a 14 % lower risk (OR per 1 SD increase
in score 5 0?76; 95 % CI 0?58, 0?99), whereas the more meat and milk products
pattern was associated with a 39 % greater risk of diabetes (OR per 1 SD increase in
score 5 1?39; 95 % CI 1?04, 1?84). Dietary glycaemic load, rice intake, snack intake
and variety of snacks were not independently associated with diabetes.
Conclusions: The more vegetables, fruits and ﬁsh pattern was associated with
reduced risk and the more meat and milk products pattern was associated with an
increased risk of diabetes.

Type 2 diabetes

Dietary factors have been shown to contribute to
the development of glucose intolerance. Foods with
high dietary glycaemic index and load, low dietary ﬁbre,
carbohydrate-rich foods(1,2), excessive energy intake(3)
and high fat intake (particularly saturated fats)(4) may
predispose to glucose intolerance. On the other hand,
high intakes of ﬁsh(5), potato, vegetables, legumes and
vitamin C(6) are inversely associated with the develop-

type 2 diabetes. However,

Recently, dietary pattern analysis has emerged as an
alternative and complementary approach to examining the

relationship between diet and the risk of chronic dis-
eases(7). Several studies have examined dietary patterns
and diabetes incidence(8–10). However, these studies were
conducted in Caucasians, who may differ signiﬁcantly from
Chinese in terms of lifestyle, diet and body physiology. The
traditional Chinese diet, with a low fat content and plenty of
vegetables(11), would be expected to reduce the likelihood
of development of diabetes but only rarely has this been
investigated prospectively in the Chinese population(12).

Studies have also highlighted the role of food variety in
body fat accumulation(13,14). A wide variety of sweets,
snacks and carbohydrates, coupled with a low variety of
vegetables, appears to promote long-term increases in

energy intake and body fat(13). In the Hong Kong Chinese
population,
increased variety of snack consumption
was associated with increased risk of developing over-
weight(14). Therefore, it would be of particular interest to
examine snack intake and variety of snacks as predis-
posing factors to diabetes in this population.

In a 9–14-year follow-up of participants recruited into
a territory-wide dietary and cardiovascular risk factor pre-
valence survey carried out in 1995–1996, in which detailed
dietary information was also obtained from a subsample,
we aimed to identify dietary patterns in a Chinese popu-
lation and examine the relationship of dietary pattern
and dietary intake, including dietary glycaemic load, rice
intake, snack intake and variety of snacks, with the
development of diabetes in this population.

Methods

Study population
The Hong Kong Dietary Survey was conducted at baseline
from October 1995 to May 1996 as part of the territory-wide
Cardiovascular Risk Factor Prevalence Survey in ethnic
Chinese. A detailed description of the sample for the Car-
diovascular Risk Factor Prevalence Survey has been
published elsewhere(15). In brief, participants were con-
tacted by a random telephone survey and invited to a
hospital-based centre at the Queen Mary Hospital, Hong
Kong SAR, China, for physical examination and blood
tests. Information on demographics, current smoking status,
alcohol intake, participation in exercise/sports and family
history of diabetes was also obtained using an interviewer-
administered questionnaire. Current smokers were deﬁned
as those who reported having smoked at least one cigarette
per day for at least 6 months before the interview. Drinkers
were deﬁned as those who drink at least once a month.
Participants were also categorized as ‘participated in exercise/
sports’ if they reported that they had been, or were cur-
rently, participating in exercise/sports 1 month before the
interview. Family history of diabetes was deﬁned as
having at least one ﬁrst-degree relative with diabetes.

Participants were divided by gender and age (ﬁve age
groups: 25–34, 35–44, 45–54, 55–64 and 65–74 years). Thus,
a total of ten groups were established. Dietary assessment
was carried out consecutively on those who attended, until
100 or more participants were recruited into each of the ten
sex- and age-speciﬁed groups. The response rate from the
telephone survey was approximately 80 %; of those who
responded, 40 % participated in blood tests and in record-
ing anthropometric measurements. The sample closely
matched the Hong Kong general population, since there
was no difference in age distribution or socio-economic
characteristics between subjects attending for blood tests
and measurements, those who participated in the tele-
phone survey, and the population as a whole as described
in the 1996 Hong Kong by-census. There were also no

signiﬁcant differences in physical or laboratory parameters
between subjects from the three geographical regions
(Hong Kong Island, Kowloon and New Territories)(16).

The overall Cardiovascular Risk Factor Prevalence Survey
included 2900 attendees aged 25–74 years, of whom 1010
(510 female and 500 male) underwent dietary assessment.
The mean age of the dietary study participants was 45?6
(SD 11?7) years. From January 2005 to December 2008, the
original cohort was invited to re-attend repeat blood tests
and recording of anthropometric measurements, including
weight, height and circumference measurements of waist
and hip. A total of 690 of the 1010 participants returned
(68?3 %). The present study was conducted according to
the guidelines laid down in the Declaration of Helsinki and
all procedures involving human subjects were approved by
the Ethics Committees of the Chinese University of Hong
Kong and the University of Hong Kong. Written informed
consent was obtained from all participants.

Dietary assessment
Dietary assessment was carried out at baseline during
1995–1996 using an FFQ, the validity of which has been
examined elsewhere(17). This consisted of 266 items in the
following seven categories: bread/pasta/rice (sixteen
items); vegetables (sixty-three items);
fruit (twenty-six
items); meat (thirty-nine items)/ﬁsh (thirty-one items)/egg
(ﬁve items); beverages (thirty-seven items); dimsum/snacks
(thirty-nine items); soups (ten items); and oil/salt/sauces.
Wherever possible, participants were instructed to maintain
a brief dietary record of the preceding 7 d before the visit,
during which time a survey on a week’s diet would be
carried out. On the day of the interview, each participant
was asked to complete the questionnaire with information
pertaining to the food item, the size of each portion and the
frequency of consumption on a daily and weekly basis.
Portion size was explained to the participants using a cat-
alogue of pictures of individual food portions.

Data were cross-checked by examining the dietary pat-
tern (e.g. if meals were skipped) to determine whether it
corresponded to the number of times staple foods such as
rice or noodles were consumed over a 1-week period. In
case of discrepancies, the questionnaire was re-checked
with the participant. The amount of cooking oil was esti-
mated according to the method of preparing different
foods: 0?2 tablespoon for steaming ﬁsh or for stir-frying half
a portion of vegetables and one tablespoon for stir-frying
one portion of vegetables or one portion of meat. The type
of oil used was also documented to allow an estimation of
the quantity of fat used in cooking. Quantiﬁcation of
nutrients was carried out using food tables for Hong Kong
compiled from McCance & Widdowson’s The Composition
of Foods(18) and two food tables used in China published
by Zhongshan University(19) and the Institute of Health of
the Chinese Medical Science Institute(20).

To identify dietary patterns, individual food items from
the FFQ were ﬁrst aggregated into groups. We formed

thirty-one separate food groups on the basis of similarity
of type of food and nutrient composition (Appendix).
Some individual
food items were preserved either
because it was inappropriate to incorporate them into a
certain food group (e.g. coffee, mayonnaise and toma-
toes) or because they were suspected to represent distinct
dietary patterns (e.g. preserved radish). Principal com-
ponent analysis (PCA) was conducted with Varimax
rotation to the thirty-one food groups. Factors with
eigenvalues $1 were retained. Four factors with eigen-
values $1?14 and explaining 50?8 % of the variance were
identiﬁed (Table 1). We labelled the ﬁrst factor as more
snacks and drinks, the second factor as more vegetables,
fruit and ﬁsh, the third factor as more meat and milk
products and the fourth factor as more reﬁned grains. A
factor score was then calculated for each participant for
each of the four patterns,
in which the standardized
intakes of each of
the thirty-one food groups were
weighted by their factor loadings and summed.

The glycaemic index values for each food item in the
FFQ were obtained from the international table of gly-
caemic index and glycaemic load values of foods(21), as

well as from several publications on the glycaemic index
of commercially available foods in the UK(22,23), from the
China Food Composition Table(24) and also from a recent
article about the glycaemic index in cereals and tubers
produced in China(25). The dietary glycaemic index for
each participant was calculated by summing the products
of the percentage contribution of each individual food to
daily available carbohydrate intake multiplied by the
food’s glycaemic index value. Available carbohydrate was
calculated as total carbohydrate minus dietary ﬁbre(21).
The dietary glycaemic load was also calculated by mul-
tiplying the dietary glycaemic index by the total amount
of daily available carbohydrate intake (divided by 100).

Variety of snacks was calculated on the basis of the
percentage of different food items consumed within the
snack food group, regardless of the frequency with which
they were consumed, as well as their portion. In addition,
the quality of diet was examined by applying the Dietary
Quality index-International (DQI-I)(26), which has been
used to evaluate the quality of the Mediterranean diet(27).
Essentially, four major aspects of the diet are assessed:
variety, adequacy, moderation and overall balance, each

1136

with subcomponents. The range is 0–100, with a high
score representing high quality. In the present study, we
did not have sufﬁcient information to calculate the cate-
gory of empty-energy foods under the aspect ‘modera-
tion’. Therefore, the range of scores for moderation was
0–24 instead of 0–30, and the DQI-I total score was 0–94
instead of 0–100.

Outcome ascertainment
The WHO Study Group (1998) criteria for glucose intol-
erance and diabetes were used to classify participants into
glucose tolerance groups. Diabetes was diagnosed if fast-
ing glucose was $7?0 mmol/l and/or the 2 h post-glucose
load was $11?1 mmol/l. Impaired glucose tolerance (IGT)
was diagnosed if fasting glucose was ,7?0 mmol/l and the
2 h post-glucose load was $7?8 mmol/l but ,11?1 mmol/l.
Impaired fasting glucose (IFG) was diagnosed if fasting
glucose was $6?1 mmol/l but ,7?0 mmol/l and the 2 h
post-glucose load was ,7?8 mmol/l.

Statistical analysis
The Student t test and the x2 test were used to test for
differences in mean age, obesity indices and selected
dietary factors, as well as for differences in distribution
of
the characteristics of participants who were alive
and had completed interviews and those who were lost
to follow-up. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards
regression was used to calculate the OR and 95 % CI of
incident diabetes by 1 SD increase in continuous dietary
pattern scores of each PCA-derived dietary pattern. Age
(in years, continuous), sex, BMI (in kg/m2, continuous),
waist-to-hip ratio (WHR; continuous), current smoking

status (categorical), alcohol intake (categorical), partici-
pation in exercise/sports (categorical) and family history
of diabetes (categorical) were considered as potential
confounders. The above analyses were also performed
for dietary glycaemic load (continuous), rice intake (in
g/week, continuous), snack intake (in g/week, con-
tinuous), variety of snacks (in %, continuous) and DQI-I
(continuous). Moreover,
the Cox models above were
repeated using the prevalence cases of IGT/IFG and dia-
betes at follow-up as the outcome. Prevalence cases of
IGT/IFG and diabetes included those with IGT/IFG or
diabetes at baseline and again at follow-up, in addition to
the incident cases of IGT/IFG or diabetes (i.e. cases in the
N-I, N-D, I-I, I-D and D-D groups). A value of P , 0?05 was
used to denote signiﬁcant difference. All analyses were
performed using the Statistical Package for the Social
Sciences statistical software package version 17?0 (SPSS
Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).

Results

Of the 1010 participants included at baseline, 690 (68?3 %)
completed interviews at a mean of 11?8 years of follow-
up and 320 (31?7 %) were lost to follow-up. Those who
were lost to follow-up were slightly older (P , 0?01), had
higher WHR (P , 0?01) and had slightly higher dietary
glycaemic load (P 5 0?096) and rice intake (P , 0?05).
Nevertheless, there were no differences in BMI, snack
intake, variety of snacks and DQI-I between those who
were lost to follow-up and those who returned (Table 2).

-Incidence of DM was calculated as N-D and I-D divided by the total number of participants without DM at baseline.

Of the 654 participants without diabetes at baseline,
seventy-four (11?3 %) developed diabetes over the follow-
up period (Table 3). Other categories of glucose tolerance
changes are also shown (e.g normal to normal, IGT/IFG/
diabetes remaining IGT/IFG/diabetes, IGT/IFG/diabetes
becoming normal).

As shown in Table 4, a 1 SD increase in more veg-
etables, fruits and ﬁsh pattern score was associated with a
13 % lower diabetes risk (OR 5 0?77; 95 % CI 0?59, 0?99)
after adjustment for age, BMI, WHR, current smoking
status, alcohol intake and participation in exercise/sports.
Additional adjustment for family history of diabetes did not
change the associations (OR 5 0?76; 95 % CI 0?58, 0?99).
In contrast, a 1 SD increase in more meat and milk products
pattern score was associated with a 39 % increased risk of
diabetes (OR 5 1?39; 95 % CI 1?04, 1?84).

Table 5 shows the risk of developing diabetes for other
dietary factors. There were suggestions of inverse asso-
ciations of DQI-I and rice intake with the development of
diabetes after adjustment for BMI, WHR, current smoking
status, alcohol
intake, participation in exercise/sports
and family history of diabetes, but the relationships were
not statistically signiﬁcant (OR for DQI-I 5 0?89, 95 % CI
0?69, 1?14; OR for rice intake 5 0?87, 95 % CI 0?78, 1?34;
Table 5). Further analyses on the relationships of diet with
glucose intolerance and diabetes using prevalence cases
of IGT/IFG and diabetes at follow-up as the outcome
showed similar results (data not shown).

Discussion

In the present 9–14-year follow-up study of Hong Kong
Chinese adults, we identiﬁed four dietary patterns using
PCA, namely, more snacks and drinks, more vegetables,
fruit and ﬁsh, more meat and milk products and more
reﬁned grains. The more vegetables, fruits and ﬁsh pattern,

which was rich in vegetables, fruit, legumes and ﬁsh, was
associated with a lower risk of diabetes. In contrast, the
more meat and milk products pattern, which was rich in
red meat, milk products and reﬁned grains, was asso-
ciated with a substantially higher risk of diabetes. These
associations were independent of age, BMI, WHR, current
smoking status, alcohol intake, participation in exercise/
sports and family history of diabetes. However, no
signiﬁcant associations were observed between dietary
glycaemic load, rice intake, snack intake, variety of
snacks and the development of diabetes.

Several prospective studies have examined dietary pat-
terns and diabetes incidence, but most of these studies
were conﬁned to Caucasians(8–10) and have rarely been

patterns have been reported. A prudent or healthy diet,
characterized by high consumption of vegetables, fruit,
ﬁsh, poultry and whole grains, was associated with
reduced risk of diabetes, whereas a Western diet, char-
acterized by high consumption of red and processed meat,
fried foods, high-fat dairy products, reﬁned grains, sweets
and desserts, was associated with increased risk. Our
results are in agreement with these studies reporting that
the more vegetables, fruits and ﬁsh pattern was associated
with reduced risk of diabetes. The protective effects of fruit
and vegetables on the development of diabetes could be
attributed to their antioxidant properties, as well as to their
dietary ﬁbre and Mg content(28,29). However, evidence
regarding the role of ﬁsh intake in relation to diabetes risk
has remained inconclusive(5,30). It is possible that a high
intake of ﬁsh may generally be an indicator of a more
health-conscious attitude; therefore, a diet rich in ﬁsh may
also be accompanied by a high consumption of vegetables
and fruit, and thus reduced risk of diabetes.

The association between the more meat and milk
products pattern and diabetes risk observed in the pre-
sent study is also consistent with studies that showed an

Dietary intake and diabetes risk

increased risk of diabetes for participants adhering to a
Western diet(8–10). The adverse effects of meat, milk
products and reﬁned grains have been attributed to their
higher saturated fat and carbohydrate content, which may
lead to hyperglycaemia and hyperinsulinaemia, and
therefore higher risk of diabetes(1,31,32).

Although the dietary patterns observed in the present
study were similar to the diets in Western populations,
levels of whole grains consumption were rather low in
our participants. Only about one-quarter of the study
population consumed food containing whole grains, with
the average intake being 0?11 (SD 0?59) servings/d. A diet
high in whole grains has previously been associated with
reduced risk of diabetes(8,33). A recent study also showed
that substitution of whole grains for white rice would
produce a 36 % reduced risk of diabetes in both men and
women(32). Given the potential beneﬁts of whole grains
on glucose metabolism, further work would be needed to
determine their role on diabetes prevention.

et al.(1)

Studies have also highlighted the role of glycaemic load
in the development of glucose intolerance and diabetes,
but results have been inconsistent. Several prospective
studies suggested positive associations of glycaemic index
and glycaemic load with diabetes risk(1,34,35), whereas
others did not show a positive association(36–38). A lack of
association between glycaemic load and measures of
insulin sensitivity,
insulin secretion and adiposity was
also observed(39). In our study, no associations were
found between dietary glycaemic load and diabetes risk.
suggested that divergent ﬁndings
Villegas
between studies could be due to differences in study
methods. An FFQ that does not address carbohydrate
quality in detail may provide inaccurate results. The FFQ
used in the present study was validated and fairly
detailed; however, higher dietary glycaemic load and rice
intake were observed in those who were lost to follow-
up, which may have introduced a bias into the estimation
of the incidence of diabetes.
It has been pointed out

that diets high in reﬁned
carbohydrates may lead to hypertension, dyslipidaemia
and metabolic intermediaries of insulin resistance(40), and
thus to diabetes risk. A recent study also found that a
higher intake of white rice was associated with a 78 %
increased risk of diabetes(32). Previously, we reported a
higher consumption of rice in participants with diabetes
who had normal BMI(41). However, in the present follow-
up study, rice intake was not related to the risk of
diabetes. It is possible that the diabetogenic potential of
rice as a staple diet observed in some other studies is
ameliorated by a higher consumption of vegetables, fruit
and ﬁsh, components of the prudent diet. It is also pos-
sible that associations might be apparent with only a wide
variation in the level of rice consumption in the study
population in which rice is the major staple food.

Consumption of snacks and fast food has been asso-

important predisposing factor for diabetes. However, we
have previously shown no difference in snack consump-
tion among the glucose tolerance groups(41). The ﬁndings
from the present longitudinal study further support the
suggestion that snack consumption was not a risk factor.
The limitations of our analysis should be noted. The
number of new cases of diabetes was small; therefore,
some predisposing factors may not have achieved statis-
tical signiﬁcance. Our measurement of diet was based on
a single FFQ administered at baseline that may not have
been representative of consumption over the long term.
Furthermore, although the complete follow-up rate is
68 %, the possibility of selection bias from differential
survival and other loss to follow-up is considerable.

In conclusion, our ﬁndings suggest that dietary patterns
in the Hong Kong Chinese can predict risk of diabetes.
However, no relationships of dietary glycaemic load, rice
intake, snack intake and variety of snacks with the devel-
opment of diabetes were observed. These ﬁndings add to
the existing evidence that dietary patterns are important
predictors for diabetes; however, further work is needed to
determine their role in diabetes prevention, and thereby
reduce the risk of diabetes in the Chinese population.

Glycemic index, glycemic load, and dietary fiber intake and
incidence of type 2 diabetes in younger and middle-aged women1–3

ABSTRACT
Background: Increasing evidence suggests an important role of
carbohydrate quality in the development of type 2 diabetes.
Objective: Our objective was to prospectively examine the associ-
ation between glycemic index, glycemic load, and dietary fiber and
the risk of type 2 diabetes in a large cohort of young women.
Design: In 1991, 91249 women completed a semiquantitative food-
frequency questionnaire that assessed dietary intake. The women
were followed for 8 y for the development of incident type 2 diabetes,
and dietary information was updated in 1995.
Results: We identified 741 incident cases of confirmed type 2 dia-
betes during 8 y (716 300 person-years) of follow-up. After adjust-
ment for age, body mass index, family history of diabetes, and other
potential confounders, glycemic index was significantly associated
with an increased risk of diabetes (multivariate relative risks for
quintiles 1–5, respectively: 1, 1.15, 1.07, 1.27, and 1.59; 95% CI:
1.21, 2.10; P for trend ҃ 0.001). Conversely, cereal fiber intake was
associated with a decreased risk of diabetes (multivariate relative
risks for quintiles 1–5, respectively: 1, 0.85, 0.87, 0.82, and 0.64;
95% CI: 0.48, 0.86; P for trend ҃ 0.004). Glycemic load was not
significantly associated with risk in the overall cohort (multivariate
relative risks for quintiles 1–5, respectively: 1, 1.31, 1.20, 1.14, and
1.33; 95% CI: 0.92, 1.91; P for trend ҃ 0.21).
Conclusions: A diet high in rapidly absorbed carbohydrates and low
in cereal fiber is associated with an increased risk of type 2
diabetes.

INTRODUCTION

The prevalence of type 2 diabetes has increased rapidly during
the past decades in the United States (1–3). Although an increase
in the prevalence of type 2 diabetes has been observed in all age
groups, it has been found to be most dramatic in younger age
groups. From 1990 to 2001, the prevalence of self-reported dia-
betes nearly doubled within the group aged 30 –39 y and in-
creased by 83% within the group aged 40 – 49 y (1, 3). Although
lifestyle characteristics such as obesity (4), physical activity (5,
6), and smoking (7) are established risk factors for this disease
(8), less is known about dietary factors (9). The quality of car-
bohydrates has received particular interest (10) because it can
influence the digestion rate and thus the blood glucose response.
Because the glycemic response varies substantially between dif-
ferent foods and because this variability is not explainable by
glucose chain length (11, 12), the concept of glycemic index was

developed to quantify the glycemic responses induced by carbo-
hydrates in different foods (13–15). Although animal studies (16,
17) and short-term studies in humans (18, 19) suggest a potential
role of high-glycemic-index diets in the development of diabetes,
no long-term intervention studies have examined the association
between the glycemic index and the risk of type 2 diabetes. In
prospective cohort studies, higher glycemic index and load pre-
dicted an increased risk of diabetes in the Nurses’ Health Study
I (8, 20) and the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study (21), no
associations were observed in the Iowa Women’s Health Study
(22), and only moderate associations with glycemic load and no
associations with glycemic index were reported in the Athero-
sclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study (23). Nevertheless,
a higher intake of dietary fiber, especially cereal fiber, has been
consistently associated with a lower risk of diabetes (20 –23).

Although the overall data suggest a potential preventive role of
diets with a low glycemic index and a high cereal fiber content,
the evidence from prospective studies is limited. Furthermore,
previous studies on this topic have focused on older participants
and women who were largely postmenopausal (20 –23). We
therefore examined the associations of glycemic index and load
and different sources of dietary fiber with incidence of type 2
diabetes in a group of younger women.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS

Study population

The Nurses’ Health Study II, established in 1989, is a prospec-
tive cohort study of 116 671 female nurses in the United States
who were 24 – 44 y of age at study initiation. This cohort is
followed up with the use of biennial mailed questionnaires

focusing on various lifestyle factors and health outcomes; the
follow-up rate exceeds 90% for every 2-y period, and we estimate
that there is almost complete (98%) ascertainment of mortality
(24). For the analyses presented here, women were excluded
from the baseline population if they did not complete a dietary
questionnaire in 1991 or if 쏜9 items on it were left blank; if the
reported total energy intake was implausible (ie, 쏝500 or 쏜3500
kcal/d); if they had a history of diabetes, cancer (except non-
melanoma skin cancer), or cardiovascular disease reported on
either the 1989 or 1991 questionnaire; or if they had no data on
physical activity in 1991. These exclusions left a total of 91 249
women for the analyses. The study was approved by the Human
Research Committees at the Harvard School of Public Health and
the Brigham and Women’s Hospital.

Dietary assessment

In 1991 the mailed questionnaire included a 133-food item
semiquantitative food-frequency questionnaire (FFQ) to obtain
dietary information. A similar questionnaire was used to update
dietary information in 1995. For each food, a commonly used
unit or portion size was specified, and women were asked how
often they had consumed that amount of each food on average
over the previous year. There were 9 possible responses ranging
from “never” to “6 or more times per day.” Nutrient intakes were
computed by multiplying the frequency response by the nutrient
content of the specified portion sizes. Values for nutrients were
derived from the US Department of Agriculture sources (25) and
supplemented with information from manufacturers. Dietary fi-
ber was determined by enzymatic-gravimetric methods 985.29
and 991.43 of the Association of Official Analytical Chemists
(26). The glycemic index values for single food items on the
questionnaire were derived with the assistance of Jenkins (Uni-
versity of Toronto), which were based on available databases and
publications (13, 27, 28). We calculated the average dietary gly-
cemic index for each participant by summing the products of the
carbohydrate content per serving for each food item times the
average number of servings of that food per day, times its gly-
cemic index, and divided by the total daily carbohydrate intake
(20, 21). Because the amount of carbohydrate in an overall diet
can vary, we also applied the concept of glycemic load, which
represents the amount of carbohydrates multiplied by the average
glycemic index. Glycemic load, glycemic index, and intakes of
dietary fiber, magnesium, and caffeine were energy-adjusted by
using the residuals method (29). Intakes of carbohydrates and
fatty acids were expressed as nutrient density (% of total energy
intake) (30). The validity and reliability of FFQs similar to those
used in the Nurses’ Health Study II were described elsewhere
(31–34). Briefly, the corrected correlation coefficients between
the FFQ and multiple dietary records for carbohydrates and fiber
were 0.64 and 0.56 in a validation study with 173 nurses aged
34 –59 y in the Nurses’ Health Study I (32, 35) and 0.73 and 0.68
in a cohort of men aged 40 –74 y in the Health Professionals
Follow-Up Study (33). Correlations for individual carbohydrate-
rich food items were found to be high as well (white bread: 0.71;
dark bread: 0.77; cold breakfast cereal: 0.79; potatoes: 0.66) (31).
The ability of the FFQ to assess dietary glycemic index and
glycemic load was documented further in a study that evaluated
the relations of these 2 variables to plasma concentrations of
HDL and triacylglycerol in postmenopausal women (36).

Ascertainment of type 2 diabetes

Women reporting a new diagnosis of diabetes (except gesta-
tional diabetes) on any of the biennial questionnaires were sent
supplementary questionnaires asking about diagnosis, treatment,
and history of ketoacidosis to confirm the self-report. The sup-
plementary questionnaire also asked for the type of diabetes
diagnosed, which was used to distinguish between type 2 and
type 1 diabetes (n ҃ 27) and gestational diabetes. In accordance
with the criteria of the National Diabetes Data Group (37), con-
firmation of diabetes required at least one of the following: 1) an
elevated plasma glucose concentration (fasting plasma glucose
욷7.8 mmol/L, random plasma glucose 욷11.1 mmol/L, or
plasma glucose 욷11.1 mmol/L 욷2 h after the beginning of an
oral-glucose-tolerance test) plus at least one classic symptom of
diabetes (excessive thirst, polyuria, weight loss, or hunger), 2) no
symptoms but 욷2 elevated plasma glucose concentrations (by
the above criteria) on different occasions, or 3) treatment with
hypoglycemic medication (insulin or oral hypoglycemic agent).
We used the National Diabetes Data Group criteria to define
diabetes because most of our cases were diagnosed before the
release of the American Diabetes Association criteria in 1997
(38). The validity of self-reported diabetes by medical profes-
sionals using the same supplementary questionnaire was docu-
mented in the Nurses’ Health Study I and the Health Profession-
als Follow-Up Study, in which substudies showed that 98% and
97%, respectively, of the self-reported cases documented by
supplementary questionnaires were confirmed by medical record
review (39, 40).

Assessment of nondietary exposure

Participants provided information biennially on their age,
weight, smoking status, contraceptive use, postmenopausal hor-
mone replacement therapy, history of high blood pressure, and
history of high blood cholesterol. We calculated body mass index
(BMI) as the ratio of weight (in kg) to squared height (in m), the
latter being assessed at baseline only. Self-reports of body weight
have been shown to be highly correlated with technician-
measured weights (r ҃ 0.96) in the Nurses’ Health Study I (41).
Family history of diabetes was reported in 1989 only. Physical
activity was assessed with the 1991 and 1997 questionnaires and
was computed as metabolic equivalents per week using the du-
ration per week of various forms of exercise, with each activity
weighted by its intensity level. Correlations between physical
activity reported on recalls and diaries and that reported on the
questionnaire were high in our cohort (0.79 and 0.62) (42).

Statistical analysis

We used Cox proportional hazards analysis stratified on 5-y
age categories to estimate relative risks for each category of
intake compared with the lowest category. Participants who were
diagnosed with diabetes (type 1 or type 2) or who died during
follow-up were censored at the date of diagnosis or death. The
1991 intake was used for the follow-up between 1991 and 1995,
and we used the average of the 1991 and 1995 intakes for the
follow-up between 1995 and 1999 to reduce within-subject vari-
ation and best represent long-term diet (43). We used only the
1991 intake data, and not the 1995 data, for those persons who
reported on the 1993 or 1995 questionnaire a diagnosis of cancer
(except nonmelanoma skin cancer) or cardiovascular disease,
because changes in diet after the development of these conditions

(43). Covariates obtained from the baseline or subsequent ques-
tionnaires were used in multivariate analyses, including BMI
(쏝21.0,
27.0 –28.9,
29.0 –30.9, 31.0 –32.9, 33.0 –34.9, and 욷35.0), total caloric in-
take (quintiles), alcohol intake (0, 0.1– 4.9, 5.0 –9.9, 욷10 g/d),
physical activity (quintiles), family history of diabetes (yes or
no), smoking (never, past, or current), history of high blood
pressure (yes or no), history of high blood cholesterol (yes or no),
postmenopausal hormone use (never or ever), oral contraceptive
use (never, past, or current), magnesium intake (quintiles), caf-
feine intake (quintiles), and types of fatty acids (quintiles). Non-
dietary covariates were updated during follow-up by using the
most recent data for each 2-y follow-up interval.

The significance of linear trends across categories of dietary
intake was tested by assigning each participant the median value
for the category and modeling this value as a continuous variable.
We also tested for effect modification by BMI, physical activity,
and family history of diabetes by performing analyses stratified

tistical analyses were performed by using SAS statistical soft-
ware (version, 6.12; SAS institute Inc, Cary, NC).

RESULTS

During 716 300 person-years of follow-up, we documented
741 new cases of type 2 diabetes. Among the study population of
91 249 women, a higher glycemic index was related to higher
carbohydrate intake, higher glycemic load, higher trans fatty
acid intake, lower alcohol intake, lower total fiber intake, lower
magnesium and caffeine intakes, and lower physical activity
(Table 1). Differences among quintiles of glycemic index for
other characteristics, such as specific fatty acid intakes, cereal
fiber intake, BMI, smoking, history of hypertension or high
blood cholesterol, or oral contraception or hormone replacement
therapy use were generally small. Participants with diets rela-
tively high in glycemic load and cereal fiber were less likely to
smoke, reported less frequently a family history of diabetes and

a history of hypertension, and were on average leaner and more
physically active. In addition, glycemic load and cereal fiber
intake were positively related to carbohydrate and total fiber
intakes and inversely related to saturated fat, monounsaturated
fat, trans fat, alcohol, and caffeine intakes. Glycemic load was
furthermore inversely related to polyunsaturated fat intake,
whereas cereal fiber intake was positively related to magnesium
intake.

Increasing glycemic index was strongly associated with a pro-
gressively higher risk of type 2 diabetes (Table 2). The age-
adjusted relative risks across quintiles 1–5 were 1.00, 1.13, 1.08,
1.31, and 1.79 (P for trend 쏝 0.001). This association remained
strong after further adjustment for BMI, alcohol consumption,
smoking, family history of diabetes, and other covariates. Fur-
ther adjustment for intakes of cereal fiber, magnesium, caffeine,

and different fatty acids did not materially change this observa-
tion. In addition, glycemic index remained positively associated
with diabetes risk after adjustment for total fiber instead of cereal
fiber (relative risk for extreme quintiles: 1.46; 95% CI: 1.12,
1.92; P for trend ҃ 0.007). In an age-adjusted analysis, both
glycemic load and total carbohydrate intake were inversely as-
sociated with the risk of type 2 diabetes. This significant asso-
ciation disappeared after adjustment for BMI.

We observed a significant inverse association between total
dietary fiber intake and risk of diabetes, but this effect was largely
attenuated after multivariate adjustment (Table 3). Of the dif-
ferent sources of fiber, cereal fiber was most strongly associated
with decreased risk. The multivariate-adjusted relative risks
across quintiles were 1.00, 0.84, 0.86, 0.81, and 0.63 (P for
trend ҃ 0.004). Adjustment for other sources of dietary fiber did

We also used a stratified analysis to assess whether the asso-

high glycemic index and a low cereal fiber intake compared with
the opposite extreme was 1.75 (95% CI: 1.22, 2.52). The positive
association between glycemic index and diabetes was more ev-
ident among those with a lower intake of cereal fiber, and the
benefit of cereal fiber was more evident among those with high-
glycemic-index diets. The test of interaction was significant (P ҃
0.004).

DISCUSSION

In this 8-y follow-up study of 91 249 female nurses, we found
a positive association between glycemic index and risk of type 2
diabetes, independent of known risk factors such as other mea-
sured dietary variables. The 59% increase in risk observed in the
highest quintile compared with the lowest quintile was somewhat
higher than the associations for other dietary risk factors previously
observed, particularly trans fatty acids and the ratio of polyunsatu-
rated to saturated fat intake (8). In addition, high intakes of cereal
and fruit fiber were associated with a lower risk of diabetes.

Although the exact mechanisms by which high-glycemic-
index diets may alter the risk of type 2 diabetes are unclear, 2
major pathways have been proposed (14, 15). First, the same
amount of carbohydrates from high-glycemic-index foods, by
definition, produce higher blood glucose concentrations and a
greater insulin demand than do low-glycemic index foods. It is

possible that chronically increased insulin demand results in
pancreatic exhaustion that can result in glucose intolerance (15).
Second, high-glycemic-index diets may directly increase insulin
resistance. In animal studies, diets high in amylopectin or glucose
produced more rapid and severe insulin resistance than did
amylose-based diets (16, 17). In a 4-wk study of 32 patients with
advanced coronary heart disease, insulin-stimulated glucose up-
take in isolated adipocytes harvested from a presternal fat biopsy
sample was significantly greater after a low-glycemic-index diet
(18). Similarly, a 3-wk trial in 28 premenopausal women ob-
served improved insulin sensitivity (on the basis of a short glu-
cose tolerance test) with a low-glycemic-index diet (19). A 4-mo
trial in 34 subjects with impaired glucose tolerance observed
lower plasma glucose and free fatty acid concentrations with a
high-carbohydrate, low-glycemic-index diet than with a high-
carbohydrate, high-glycemic-index diet (44).

Our data were broadly consistent with those observed among
older participants in the Nurses’ Health Study I (20) and the
Health Professionals Follow-Up Study (21). The relative risks
comparing extreme quintiles of glycemic index were 1.37 (95%
CI: 1.09, 1.71; P for trend ҃ 0.005) in the Nurses’ Health Study
I and 1.37 (95% CI: 1.02, 1.83; P for trend ҃ 0.03) in the Health
Professionals Follow-Up Study. In contrast, no associations be-
tween glycemic index and risk of diabetes were observed in the
Iowa Women’s Health Study (22) and the ARIC Study (23).
However, neither study collected repeated measurements of diet

that might have led to an underestimation of the effect size (43).
In addition, the questionnaire used in the ARIC Study was a
shorter version of the Nurses’ Health Study I questionnaire that
did not address carbohydrate quality in detail (35). Also, the
diagnosis of diabetes in the Iowa Women’s Health Study was
based entirely on self-report (22), and the ARIC Study did not
distinguish type 1 and type 2 diabetes (23). Misclassification of
either exposure or disease status might, therefore, have led to an
underestimation of the association between glycemic index and
diabetes in these studies (45). A high glycemic load was related
to a more health conscious lifestyle in our cohort, whereas the
opposite was observed for the glycemic index. In contrast with
our study, glycemic index and load were associated with lower
physical activity and higher BMI in the Nurses’ Health Study I
(20) and the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study (21). A
health-conscious diet and lifestyle would tend to negatively con-
found the association for glycemic load, which might explain the
lack of association observed in the overall cohort in our study in
contrast with the positive association observed in the Nurses’
Health Study I (20).

Previous studies have not presented an analysis stratified by
BMI, physical activity, or family history of diabetes. The indi-
vidual response to a given carbohydrate load is influenced by the
degree of underlying insulin resistance. Physical activity
strongly influences glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity (46)
and is a strong predictor of reduced diabetes risk in epidemio-
logic studies (39, 40, 47, 48). Similarly, a family history of
diabetes has been identified to be a strong risk factor for diabetes
(49) and insulin resistance, independent of BMI (50 –52). Thus,
it is expected that the effects of high-glycemic-index foods are
stronger in obese, sedentary, and genetically susceptible persons
(15). Although the effects of glycemic index and load seemed to
be more pronounced among sedentary persons and persons with
a family history of diabetes in our study, tests for interaction were
not significant. Also, obesity did not significantly modify the
effect of glycemic index and load in our study, but our analyses

of these effect modifications were limited by a relatively small
number of cases.

It is not clear why cereal fiber exerts stronger inverse associ-
ations than do other sources of fiber. Viscous fibers seem to affect
gastric emptying rate and absorption in the small intestine (53–
56). Similarly, viscous fibers were found to have effects on post-
prandial glycemic response to high-carbohydrate test meals (53).
In contrast, insoluble fiber but not soluble fiber, was found to be
inversely associated with diabetes risk in previous cohort studies
(22, 57). Although cereal products from oat, barley, and psyllium
are high in soluble fiber, major sources of soluble fiber are fruit,
vegetables, nuts, legumes, and seeds. Whole-grain and bran
products from wheat and corn, the major source of cereal fiber in
our cohort (58), typically contain insoluble fiber. Despite the lack
of an obvious mechanism for the benefits of cereal fiber in pre-
venting diabetes, in all 5 prospective cohort studies that exam-
ined associations between different types of dietary fiber and risk
of type 2 diabetes, cereal fiber appeared to be most strongly
inversely associated with risk (20 –23, 57). The intake of cereal
fiber in our cohort (energy-adjusted median intake in third quin-
tile: 5.2 g/d) was higher than the intake in older nurses in the
Nurse’s Health Study I (3.7 g/d) but was similar to that in the
older women in the Iowa Women’s Health Study (4.9 g/d). Be-
cause trials of the effects of high-fiber cereal foods and markers
of blood glucose control have provided conflicting results (59,
60), it is possible that the consistent effects of cereal fiber ob-
served in observational studies are due to residual confounding.
We adjusted for glycemic load, magnesium intake, and lifestyle
characteristics in our analysis, which had a minimal effect on the
observed associations. Thus, it is unlikely that the effects of
cereal fiber can be explained by residual confounding.

Several limitations apply to our study. Although the validity
and reliability of FFQs similar to those used in the Nurses’ Health
Study II have been evaluated in similar cohort studies of US health
professionals (31–34), we did not validate the questionnaire in our
study population but rather assumed that the validation data from

these other studies applied to our sample. Because these validation
studies were carried out in men and older women, the validation data
may not have actually applied to our sample. A direct comparison of
risk estimates across studies needs to be done cautiously.

Furthermore, errors in the measurement of dietary intake (eg,
errors resulting from the limited quality of available food-
composition data, particularly with regard to carbohydrates and
dietary fiber, and by random error) may have limited our ability
to obtain accurate risk estimates.

Concerns have also been raised about the application of the
glycemic index to mixed meals, because other aspects of diet
might lead to varying glucose and insulin responses. However,
studies showed that the glycemic index of a mixed meal can be
predicted consistently as the weighted average of the glycemic
index values of each of the component foods, weighted by their
relative contribution to total carbohydrates (61– 63). In addition,
although fat and protein affect the absolute glycemic response,
they do not affect the relative differences between foods (64, 65).
Furthermore, studies using standardized techniques have found
excellent correlations between observed glycemic index values
of mixed meals and the calculated values based on individual
component foods (61–63). Moreover, metabolic studies in hyper-
lipidemic (66, 67), diabetic (68–71), and healthy persons (72) have
shown adverse metabolic effects of high-glycemic index diets, par-
ticularly elevated triacylglycerol concentrations. These effects were
replicated in apparently healthy postmenopausal women in the
Nurses’ Health Study I (36) by using a dietary questionnaire similar
to the one used in our study. This suggests a physiologic relevance
of the estimated average glycemic index and load in our study,
although this has not been shown in healthy young women. Al-
though our FFQ was not initially designed to pick up differences in
the glycemic index of foods, it was designed to explain variance in
the quantity and quality of carbohydrate intake (35). Correlations
between similar questionnaires and diet records were found to be
high for both total carbohydrates and fiber (31). Because the calcu-
lated glycemic index represents an average over all food items,
weighed by their contribution to total carbohydrate intake, the de-
sign of the questionnaire should have ensured a relative accurate
estimation of glycemic index.

Misclassification of disease status should not have biased our
observations. We previously reported that our case definition,
which was based on self-reports on an extended questionnaire, is
highly accurate compared with medical records (39, 40). Given
the resulting high specificity of the classification, the remaining
misclassification (nonidentified cases) should not have biased
our results (73). We did not directly validate the case definition
in our cohort, but assumed that women participating in the
Nurses’ Health Study II are similar with respect to the validity of
self-reports compared with the Nurses’ Health Study I. However,
our results were very similar to those reported from the Nurses’
Health Study I (20), and consistent associations were observed
for alcohol intake and the risk of diabetes in both cohorts (74, 75),
which supports this assumption.

In conclusion, our findings support the hypothesis that diets
with a high glycemic index and low in cereal fiber increase the
risk of type 2 diabetes, particularly in women with a sedentary
lifestyle and a family history of diabetes. This study reinforces
the importance of the quality of carbohydrates consumed in pre-
venting type 2 diabetes.

Rice intake and type 2 diabetes in Japanese men and women:
the Japan Public Health Center–based Prospective Study1–3

Akiko Nanri, Tetsuya Mizoue, Mitsuhiko Noda, Yoshihiko Takahashi, Masayuki Kato, Manami Inoue, and Shoichiro Tsugane

ABSTRACT
Background: Reﬁned carbohydrates have been suggested to dete-
riorate glucose metabolism; however, whether persons with elevated
intakes of white rice, which is a major staple food for the Japanese,
experience increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes remains
unclear.
Objective: We prospectively investigated the association between
white rice intake and risk of type 2 diabetes.
Design: Participants were 25,666 men and 33,622 women aged 45–
75 y who participated in the second survey of the Japan Public
Health Center–based Prospective Study and who had no prior his-
tory of diabetes. We ascertained food intake by using a validated
147-item food-frequency questionnaire. Odds ratios of self-reported,
physician-diagnosed type 2 diabetes over 5 y were estimated by using
logistic regressions.
Results: A total of 1103 new cases of type 2 diabetes were self-
reported. There was a signiﬁcant association between rice intake and
an increased risk of type 2 diabetes in women; the multivariate-
adjusted odds ratio for the highest compared with lowest quartiles
of rice intake was 1.65 (95% CI: 1.06, 2.57; P for trend = 0.005). In
men, the association was unclear, although there was a suggestion of
a positive association in persons who were not engaged in strenuous
physical activity (P for trend = 0.08).
Conclusions: Elevated intake of white rice is associated with an
increased risk of type 2 diabetes in Japanese women. The ﬁnding
that is suggestive of a positive association of rice intake in physi-
Am J Clin Nutr
cally inactive men deserves further investigation.

role of environmental factors, particularly dietary factors, that
might account for the epidemic of type 2 diabetes in Japanese.
Japanese studies have shown that a low calcium intake, which is
typical of Japanese populations (6), was associated with an el-
evated risk of type 2 diabetes (7), and a dietary pattern char-
acterized by a high intake of traditional Japanese foods, such as
soybean products, seaweed, Japanese pickles, and green tea, was
associated with an increased prevalence of glucose intolerance
(8). These previous ﬁndings suggested that a traditional Japa-
nese diet may be associated with the high prevalence of diabetes
in Japanese populations.

White rice is a major staple food of Japanese and forms the
basis of the Japanese diet. Although rice consumption in Japan
has decreased over the past several decades, nearly 30% of total
energy intake for Japanese is still derived from rice (6). Com-
pared with brown rice, white rice contains less dietary ﬁber and
fewer vitamins and minerals (9), which are potentially protective
against type 2 diabetes. In some (10–15) but not all (16) studies,
foods such as white rice, which are rich in reﬁned carbohydrates,
have been implicated in the deterioration of glucose metabolism,
with a subsequent increasing risk of type 2 diabetes. However,
few such studies have been conducted in Asian populations (15),
which are known to consume large amounts of rice. Thus far, the
only prospective study in Asia (China) (15) reported results for
women, and the association in Asian men remains unclear.
Therefore, we prospectively examined the association between
white rice intake and risk of type 2 diabetes in Japanese adults by
using data from a large-scale population-based cohort study in

INTRODUCTION

The prevalence of type 2 diabetes has been increasing
worldwide (1). In particular, the prevalence of diabetes in Japan
increased from 13.7 to 22.1 million between 1997 and 2007 (2).
Such an increase might be ascribed to an energy imbalance,
which develops easily in individuals who live a sedentary life and,
in many cases, accompanies obesity. Although the prevalence of
obesity [body mass index (BMI; in kg/m2) .30] in the Japanese
is lower than in Westerners (Japan: 3% in both men and women;
United States: 31% in men and 33% in women) (3), the prev-
alence of type 2 diabetes in Japanese populations is not dra-
matically lower than that in Western populations (Japan: 7.3%;
United Kingdom: 4.9%; United States: 12.3%) (4). This has
been attributed to a genetic difference between Asian and white
populations (5), with limited evidence available regarding the

Japan. We also examined whether the association was modiﬁed
by known risk factors for type 2 diabetes.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS

Study population

The Japan Public Health Center–based Prospective (JPHC)
Study was launched in 1990 for cohort I and in 1993 for cohort II
(17) and involved residents of 11 public health centers aged 40–
69 y at each baseline survey. Study participants were informed of
the objectives of the study, and participants who responded to the
questionnaire survey were regarded as consenting to participate
in the study. A questionnaire survey was conducted at baseline
and at the 5- and 10-y follow-ups. Information on medical his-
tories and health-related lifestyles, such as smoking, drinking,
and dietary habits, was obtained at each survey. This study was
approved by the Institutional Review Board of the National
Cancer Center of Japan.

From the study population at baseline (n = 140,420), we
excluded subjects who resided in 2 public health center areas
because of differences in recruitment criteria. Of the remaining
116,672 eligible subjects, 95,373 (81.7%) subjects responded to
the questionnaire survey at baseline. Of these subjects, 80,128
(84.0%) subjects responded to the 5-y follow-up survey (second
survey), including the diet-related portion, and 71,075 (74.5%)
of those subjects responded to the subsequent 10-y follow-up
survey (third survey). We excluded any subject who reported
a history of type 2 diabetes (n = 5183) or severe diseases (n =
6284), including cancer, cerebrovascular disease, myocardial
infarction, chronic liver disease, and renal disease, at the base-
line or second surveys. An additional 556 subjects with missing
information for rice intake and 537 subjects who reported ex-
treme total energy intakes (outside of the mean 6 3 SD ac-
cording to sex) were excluded, which left a total of 59,288
subjects (25,666 men and 33,622 women) who were ultimately
enrolled in our analysis.

Food-frequency questionnaire

At baseline, second, and third surveys, participants completed
a self-administered questionnaire. During data analyses in the
current study, we used data from the second survey as baseline
data because the questionnaire used for the second survey more
comprehensively inquired about food intakes than that used for
the baseline survey. At the second survey, a food-frequency
questionnaire (FFQ) was used to assess the average intake of 147
food and beverage items over the previous year (18). For rice
(japonica rice; round and short grain), participants were asked to
denote their usual rice-bowl size from 3 options (small, medium,
and large) and the number of bowls consumed daily from 9
options that ranged from ,1 to 10/d. One bread item and 4
noodle items (Japanese, buckwheat, Okinawa, and Chinese
noodles) were also included in the FFQ. For most food items,
including the bread and noodle items, 9 response options were
available to describe consumption frequency, which ranged from
rarely (,1 time/mo) to 7 times/d. A standard portion size was
speciﬁed for each food, and respondents were asked to denote
their usual portion size from 3 options (less than one-half,
standard, or .1.5 times). We calculated the daily intake of

staple foods by multiplying daily consumption frequency by the
typical portion size. For the calculation of food and nutrient
intakes, the missing of consumption frequency and usual portion
size of all food items were set as zero and a standard portion
size, respectively. The validity of the FFQ was assessed in
subsamples by using either 14- or 28-d dietary records. Spear-
man’s correlation coefﬁcients between intake values for rice,
bread, and noodles derived from the FFQ and those derived from
dietary records were 0.67, 0.67, and 0.42, respectively, in men
and 0.55, 0.63, and 0.43, respectively, in women. With regard to
the reproducibility of estimations between the 2 FFQs admin-
istered 1 y apart, the respective Spearman’s correlation co-
efﬁcients for intake of rice, bread, and noodles were 0.79, 0.70,
and 0.49 in men and 0.69, 0.67, and 0.57 in women.

Ascertainment of type 2 diabetes

Type 2 diabetes newly diagnosed during the 5-y period after the
second survey was determined by a self-administered question-
naire at the third survey. At the third survey, study participants were
asked if they had ever been diagnosed with diabetes, and if so,
when the initial diagnosis had been made. Because we used the
second survey as the starting point of observation for the incidence
of type 2 diabetes, only those subjects who were diagnosed after
1995 for cohort I and after 1998 for cohort II were regarded as
incident cases during follow-up. Details regarding the assessment
of the validity of self-reported diabetes have been described
elsewhere (19). In a previous study (19) that we conducted, 94%
of self-reported diabetes cases were conﬁrmed as such by medical
records. Upon application of these data to the survey results
obtained from a JPHC subpopulation (health-checkup partic-
ipants) whose plasma glucose data were available, the sensitivity
and speciﬁcity of self-reported diabetes were estimated to be
85.5% and 99.7%, respectively, in men and 79.3% and 99.7%,
respectively, in women.

Physical activity

To assess daily physical activity, subjects were asked about the
average amount of time spent per day engaging in 3 types of
physical activity at work and during leisure time: strenuous
physical activity (none, ,1, or 1 h), sitting (,3, 3 to ,8, or
8 h), and standing or walking (,1, 1 to ,3, or 3 h). Details
regarding the calculation of total physical activity level (meta-
bolic equivalent task hours [MET-h]/d) have been described
elsewhere (20). The validity of the total METs per day was
assessed in subsamples by using 4-d, 24-h physical activity re-
cords from 2 different seasons. Spearman’s correlation co-
efﬁcients between total METs per day and the physical activity
records were 0.53 in men and 0.35 in women (20).

Statistical analyses

Participants were classiﬁed into quartiles of rice, bread, and
noodle intake by sex. In the analysis for bread and noodle intake,
subjects with a missing for consumption frequency for these
foods were excluded in each analysis. Confounding variables
considered were as follows: age (y, continuous), study area (9
areas), BMI (,21, 21–22.9, 23–24.9, 25–26.9, or 27), smoking
habit (lifetime nonsmoker, former smoker, or current smoker
with a consumption of either ,20 or 20 cigarettes/d), alcohol

total energy intake (kcal/d, continuous), coffee consumption
(almost never, ,1, 1, or 2 cups/d), calcium intake (mg/d,
continuous), magnesium intake (mg/d, continuous), dietary ﬁber
intake (g/d, continuous), fruit intake (g/d, continuous), vegetable
intake (g/d, continuous), and ﬁsh intake (g/d, continuous). An
indicator variable for missing data was created for each co-
variate. Trend associations between confounding factors and
rice, bread, or noodle intakes were tested by using Mantel-
Haenszel’s chi-square test for categorical variables and linear
regression analysis for continuous variables.

Odds ratios and 95% CIs of type 2 diabetes for categories of
rice, bread, and noodle intakes were estimated by using multiple
logistic regression analysis by taking the lowest category as
a reference. The ﬁrst model was adjusted for age and study area,
and the second model was further adjusted for smoking habit,
alcohol consumption, total physical activity, history of hyper-
tension, family history of diabetes, occupation, total energy in-
take, and dietary factors including coffee consumption and
intakes of calcium, magnesium, dietary ﬁber, fruit, vegetable, and
ﬁsh, which were mutually adjusted for rice, bread, and noodle in-
takes (g/d, quartiles). In the analysis for rice intake, an indicator
variable for missing of consumption frequency for bread and
noodle items was created. In the ﬁnal model, BMI was added to
the third model. A trend association was assessed by assigning
ordinal numbers 0–3 to the 4 categories of staple food con-
sumption. We also analyzed the association between rice intake
and type 2 diabetes by strenuous physical activity at work or
during leisure time (,1 or 1 h/d), age (,60 or 60 y), BMI
(,25 or 25), occupation [primary industries (agriculture,
forestry, or ﬁshery) or others], smoking status in men only
(nonsmoker or current smoker), and menopausal status in
women only (pre- or postmenopausal). We also conducted a re-
analysis after the exclusion of subjects who added minor cereals
(foxtail millet, Japanese barnyard millet, or barley) to rice. An
interaction term by multiplying rice intake (g/d, continuous) and
the above stratifying variables (dichotomous) was created and
added to the model to assess statistical interactions. A 2-sided
P , 0.05 was regarded as statistically signiﬁcant. All analyses
were performed with Statistical Analysis System (SAS) version
9.1 software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).

RESULTS

During the 5-y period, 1103 participants were newly diagnosed
with diabetes (625 men and 478 women). The characteristics of
study participants according to quartile categories of rice, bread,
and noodle intake for men and women, separately, are shown in
Table 1. Participants with relatively high intakes of rice, bread, or
noodles were, on average, younger than participants with low
intakes. Men with higher rice intakes tended to be current
smokers, and women with high rice intakes were less likely to
consume alcohol. Both men and women who consumed greater
amounts of rice tended to have a lower BMI, were more likely to
report higher levels of total physical activity, were more likely to
be engaged in strenuous physical activity at work or during leisure
time and to work in primary industries, and consumed less pro-
tein, fat, calcium, magnesium, dietary ﬁber, and coffee than par-
ticipants with lower rice intakes. Men and women in the category
of higher bread intake were less likely to work in primary in-

dustries. Men with increased bread intakes were less likely to be
current smokers and alcohol drinkers. Bread intake was positively
associated with the intake of fat, dietary ﬁber (men only), coffee,
calcium (men only), and magnesium (men only). Men and
women with higher noodle intakes were more likely to be alcohol
drinkers and consumed greater amounts of dietary ﬁber but less
calcium. In this population, carbohydrates from rice, bread, and
noodle intakes accounted for 51.9%, 3.3%, and 7.4% of the total
carbohydrate intake, respectively, in men and for 46.4%, 4.6%,
and 6.3% of the total carbohydrate intake, respectively, in women.
Odds ratios and 95% CIs of type 2 diabetes associated with
intakes of each staple food are shown in Table 2. In women, rice
intake was signiﬁcantly and positively associated with the in-
cidence of type 2 diabetes with adjustment for age and area (P
for trend = 0.004); the odds ratio for the highest compared with
lowest quartile category was 1.48 (95% CI: 1.03, 2.14). The
association remained signiﬁcant even after adjustment for other
covariates (P for trend = 0.005), with a fully adjusted odds ratio
for the highest compared with lowest quartile category of 1.65
(95% CI: 1.06, 2.57). In men, the incidence of type 2 diabetes
tended to increase with rice intake after adjustment for lifestyle
factors other than dietary factors (odds ratio for the highest
compared with lowest quartile category: 1.31; 95% CI: 0.98,
1.77; P for trend = 0.06) (data not shown in Table 2). However,
the association was attenuated on further adjustment for dietary
factors and BMI (odds ratio for the highest compared with
lowest quartile category: 1.19; 95% CI: 0.85, 1.68; P for trend =
0.32). We obtained similar results to those above after repeating
the analysis by using energy-adjusted rice intake (by a residual
method) rather than crude intake. The respective fully adjusted
odds ratios (95% CIs) of type 2 diabetes for the lowest through
highest quartile categories of energy-adjusted rice intake were
1.00 (reference), 1.22 (0.96, 1.56), 1.40 (1.09, 1.81), and 1.24
(0.92, 1.68), respectively, in men (P for trend = 0.09) and 1.00
(reference), 1.34 (1.01, 1.78), 1.51 (1.12, 2.05), and 1.55 (1.11,
2.17), respectively, in women (P for trend = 0.01).

In analyses stratiﬁed by physically strenuous activity at work
or during leisure time (Table 3), a marginally signiﬁcant trend
association between rice intake and type 2 diabetes was ob-
served in men who were not engaged in strenuous physical ac-
tivity (P for trend = 0.08), whereas such a trend association was
not observed in men who were engaged in strenuous physical
activity (P for trend = 0.85, P for interaction = 0.23). Likewise,
a marginally signiﬁcant, positive trend association between rice
intake and type 2 diabetes was observed in women who were not
engaged in any strenuous physical activity (P for trend = 0.08)
but was not observed in women who were engaged in such
activity (P for trend = 0.30, P for interaction = 0.27). Further,
increased risk of type 2 diabetes associated with rice intake was
more pronounced in both men and women who worked in jobs
other than primary industries, in smoking men, and in women
with BMI ,25.

In women but not men, the association was strengthened after
the exclusion of subjects who sometimes or always added minor
cereals to rice; fully adjusted odds ratios (95% CIs) of type 2
diabetes for the lowest to highest quartile categories of rice intake
were 1.00 (reference), 1.29 (0.85, 1.97), 1.67 (1.08, 2.58), and
1.81 (1.03, 3.18), respectively (P for trend = 0.01).

With regard to bread intake, the incidence of type 2 diabetes
was lower in the age- and area-adjusted model in men in the

2 Values are medians; ranges in parentheses.
3 Adjusted for age (y), study area (9 areas), smoking status (never, past, or current with a consumption of ,20 or 20 cigarettes/d), alcohol consumption
(for men: nondrinker, occasional drinker, or drinker with a consumption of ,150, 150–299, 300–449, or 450 g ethanol/wk; for women: nondrinker,
occasional drinker, or drinker with a consumption of ,150 or 150 g ethanol/wk), family history of diabetes mellitus (yes or no), total physical activity
(quartile of metabolic equivalent task hours per day), history of hypertension (yes or no), occupation (agriculture, forestry, or ﬁshery; salaried, self-employed,
or professional; or housework, unemployed, or retired), total energy intake (kcal/d), coffee consumption (almost never, ,1, 1, or 2 cups/d), and intakes of
calcium (mg/d), magnesium (mg/d), ﬁber (g/d), fruit (g/d), vegetables (g/d), ﬁsh (g/d). Intakes (according to g/d quartile) of rice, bread, and noodles were also
mutually adjusted for.

4 Additionally adjusted for BMI (in kg/m2; ,21, 21–22.9, 23–24.9, 25–26.9, or 27).

highest intake category compared with men in the lowest intake
category (odds ratio: 0.81; 95% CI: 0.62, 1.05; P for trend =
0.08) (Table 2). However, the association was attenuated after
adjustment for other covariates (fully adjusted odds ratio: 0.85;
95% CI: 0.64, 1.14; P for trend = 0.30). No association was
observed between noodle intake and type 2 diabetes in either
men or women.

DISCUSSION

In this large-scale, population-based, prospective study in
Japanese adults, rice intake was shown to be associated with
increased risk of type 2 diabetes in women. A signiﬁcant increase
in risk was observed in women with rice intakes 3 bowls (420 g)/d.
The association between rice intake and type 2 diabetes risk was
particularly pronounced in physically inactive women, nonobese

RICE INTAKE AND TYPE 2 DIABETES

women, women who worked in jobs other than primary in-
dustries, and women who did not add minor cereals to rice. The
overall association in men was not clear, although there was
a suggestion of increased risk of type 2 diabetes with rice intake
in physically inactive men and smoking men. Bread or noodle
intake was not associated with risk of type 2 diabetes. Regarding
evidence of a rice–type 2 diabetes association in Asia, our study
replicated previous ﬁnding in Chinese women (15).

The current ﬁnding of an increased risk of type 2 diabetes
associated with increased rice consumption is consistent with
a previous result noted in a population in China (15), where white
rice is consumed as a major staple food. In that previous study
(15), women who consumed 300 g rice/d had a 1.8-fold greater
risk of developing type 2 diabetes than did women who con-
sumed ,200 g rice/d. A similar association between diabetes
risk and white rice consumption was observed in a US study
(14). Furthermore, our ﬁndings appeared to agree with dietary
pattern analyses for Japanese populations. Nanri et al (21) re-
ported a higher prevalence of elevated glycated hemoglobin
concentrations in persons with a high dietary pattern score
characterized by frequent rice intake than in those with a low
score. Our ﬁnding of decreased risk of type 2 diabetes in men
with greater bread intake in an age- and area-adjusted model
also agreed with previous ﬁndings of a Japanese study (8, 21).
However, in our current study, this inverse association became
nonsigniﬁcant after adjustment for covariates, including calcium
and coffee intake. Because milk and coffee are commonly
consumed with bread by Japanese and have been linked to
a decreased risk of type 2 diabetes (22, 23), the roles of these
items as confounders may account for the seemingly protective
association between bread intake and type 2 diabetes risk. Taken
together, these data suggested that, in Japanese, greater rice
consumption contributes to an increased risk of type 2 diabetes,
whereas a bread-eating dietary pattern (but not necessarily bread
per se) is related to a decreased risk.

The mechanism by which increased rice consumption
increases risk of type 2 diabetes remains unclear. As shown in
Table 1, increased rice consumption was associated with rela-
tively lower intakes of other foods linked to lower risk of type 2
diabetes such as coffee and nutrients, such as magnesium and
calcium (22–24). However, the association between rice intake
and type 2 diabetes risk remained signiﬁcant even after adjust-
ment for these food factors, which suggested an independent role
of white rice in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes. One plausible
explanation is that white rice has a high glycemic index (25),
which is a measure of the effect of food intake on blood glucose
concentrations (26) and has been shown to predict type 2 diabetes
risk (27). In a study of diabetic and prediabetic Japanese adults,
the administration of dietary advice to lower the dietary glycemic
index successfully helped participants reduce their glycated
hemoglobin concentrations, which supported the importance of
the dietary glycemic index in the prevention of type 2 diabetes in
Japanese (28). For Japanese, white rice is the major contributor to
the dietary glycemic load (29), which has been shown to increase
risk of type 2 diabetes (27). Furthermore, a number of beneﬁcial
nutrients including insoluble ﬁber and magnesium, which are
potentially protective against type 2 diabetes, are removed when
producing polished white rice (9).

Subjects with a higher intake of rice tended to have a lower
BMI than those with a lower intake of rice (Table 1), which

suggested that rice or a rice-based diet, probably because of its
low fat content, may aid in obesity prevention better than a diet
with low rice consumption, at least from an ecologic standpoint.
Nevertheless, we noted an increased risk of type 2 diabetes
in persons who consumed greater amounts of rice, which sug-
gested that a high intake of rice may increase type 2 diabetes
independent of BMI. This paradoxical association appears to
explain from a dietary point of view why the prevalence of type
2 diabetes in Japanese is similarly as high as in Western pop-
ulations, despite the much lower prevalence of obesity in Jap-
anese than in Western populations, and why the difference in
BMIs between Japanese with and without type 2 diabetes is much
smaller than that observed in Western populations (30). High rice
intake may increase the risk of type 2 diabetes through mech-
anisms other than obesity-related ones.

We observed a marginally signiﬁcant trend association be-
tween rice consumption and type 2 diabetes risk in men and
women who did not engage in strenuous physical activity at work
or in leisure time but not in subjects who did engage in such
activity. This result underscored the importance of physical
activity in the assessment of the diet-diabetes risk relation. More
speciﬁcally, low physical activity may be a prerequisite condition
for rice consumption to inﬂuence type 2 diabetes risk. If a large
proportion of glucose is taken up and metabolized in muscle, high
levels of physical activity may counterbalance elevated rice in-
take. This may have been the situation in the Japanese society in
the past, and we speculate that the association between rice
consumption and risk of type 2 diabetes observed in the current
study may have emerged as sedentary lifestyles became more
prevalent in Japan.

Besides being physically active, can dietary modiﬁcation at-
tenuate type 2 diabetes risk associated with rice consumption?
Because minor cereals are rich in magnesium and ﬁber and are
potentially important food factors in the regulation of glucose
absorption and metabolism (31), the addition of these to rice is
expected to help reduce type 2 diabetes risk. We observed a more
pronounced association between rice intake and type 2 diabetes
risk in women after the exclusion of subjects who added minor
cereals to rice, a ﬁnding that may indirectly support the protective
role of minor cereals. Although the small number of minor cereal
consumers in our study hindered an interpretation of the null result
in them with reasonable conﬁdence, previous intervention trials in
Japan have shown that supplementing rice with minor cereals
signiﬁcantly reduced postprandial glucose concentrations (32, 33).
We observed a more pronounced association between rice
intake and type 2 diabetes in smoking men and nonobese women.
The intake of carbohydrates with a high glycemic index increases
insulin resistance and the demand for insulin (34). Because
smoking is known to decrease b cell function (35), smokers may
be more likely than nonsmokers to have higher glucose con-
centrations after high rice intake. Contrary to the anticipated
adverse effects of high glycemic index foods in overweight
persons (34), we observed an association between rice intake
and type 2 diabetes risk in nonobese women but not in obese
women. One possible explanation for this ﬁnding is that glucose
metabolism in nonobese individuals, who are less able to secrete
insulin than obese individuals (36, 37), may be more easily
deteriorated by an increased demand for insulin after rice intake.
Major strengths of the current study included our large sample

a validated FFQ, and adjustment for or stratiﬁcation by poten-
tially important confounding variables. Furthermore, gathering
data from a Japanese population allowed us to assess any po-
tential association at relatively extremely high amounts of rice
consumption (rice intake for the highest category in men was .560
g/d). However, several limitations to the current study warrant
mention. First, the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes was ascertained
by self-report. However, a validation study conducted in our
study population showed fairly good agreement between self-
reported diabetes and diabetes as documented in medical records
(94%), and the sensitivity of self-reported diabetes was rea-
sonably high (83%). Nevertheless, the misclassiﬁcation of out-
comes may have distorted the results to some extent. Second,
dietary intakes were measured only once and thus may not have
reﬂected long-term intake. Repeated assessment of diet over
a long period of time before disease onset will likely provide
a better estimate of exposure status. Third, although whole-grain
consumption has been reported to reduce risk of developing type
2 diabetes (38), we gathered no information about the type of
grains consumed by our study population. However, because of
the limited market for whole grains in Japan, the rice consumed
in the current study population may have been only or largely
white rice (reﬁned grains). Finally, results obtained in subgroup
analyses may be due to chance and, thus, should be interpreted
with caution.

The ﬁndings from this large-scale prospective study suggested
that an increased intake of rice increases risk of developing type 2
diabetes in Japanese women. The rice-centered Japanese diet is
characterized by low fat intakes and has major advantages over
a Western-style diet in terms of contributing to cardiovascular health
(39); however, the same may not be true for the prevention of type 2
diabetes. For Japanese or other populations who consume rice as
a major staple food, dietary modiﬁcation strategies should be ex-
plored to prevent type 2 diabetes without increasing risk of car-
diovascular disease.

Background/Objectives: Milk intake is widely recommended for a healthy diet. Epidemiological studies have suggested that
the consumption of dairy products may be associated with a reduction in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). A meta-analysis was
conducted to elucidate the association between dairy products consumption and T2DM.
Subjects/Methods: A systematical literature search was done through the Medline database and seven related cohort studies
were identified. The adjusted relative risks (RRs) with the highest and the lowest categories from each study were extracted to
calculate the combined RR. A least-square trend estimation was applied to assess the dose-response relationships.
Results: A combined RR of 0.86 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.79–0.92) was revealed on T2DM risk associated to dairy
intake, with little evidence of heterogeneity. For subgroup analysis, a combined RR was 0.82 (95% CI, 0.74–0.90), 1.00 (95% CI,
0.89–1.10), 0.95 (95% CI, 0.86–1.05) and 0.83 (95% CI, 0.74–0.93) for the intake of low-fat dairy, high-fat dairy, whole milk
and yogurt, respectively. Dose-response analysis showed that T2DM risk could be reduced 5% for total dairy products and 10%
for low-fat dairy products.
Conclusion: An inverse association of daily intake of dairy products, especially low-fat dairy, with T2DM was revealed, indicating
a beneficial effect of dairy consumption in the prevention of T2DM development.

Introduction

The world prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is
increasing at an alarming rate. T2DM affects approximately
190 million people worldwide and it is very likely to increase
to 366 million by 2030 (Wild et al., 2004). Epidemiological
data suggest that the prevalence will continue to increase
globally without effective prevention and control (Alberti
et al., 2007). Human studies have shown that diet and
lifestyle modifications may have an important role in
preventing T2DM (Eriksson and Lindgarde, 1991; Lindstrom
et al., 2003).

In recent years, the role of dairy products in the etiology of
T2DM has created considerable attention in research fields.
Some cohort studies aiming at examining the relationship
between the intake of dairy products and T2DM observed a
significantly inverse association, but others showed negative
results. Some factors related to the dairy components have
been assumed to modify the effect of dairy intake on T2DM,
such as the type and fat level of the dairy products, as well as
the amount of daily consumption. Although a recent review
reported the prevention of dairy intake to T2DM (Pittas et al.,
2007), these factors have not been included. To clarify the
mechanism by which dairy consumption prevents human
from T2DM, it is reasonable to examine the association
between these factors and T2DM risk, using a meta-analysis
of cohort studies.

database through April 2010, using the English terms in

Dietary Fiber, Glycemic Load, and Risk of
NIDDM in Men

OBJECTIVE —  Intake  of carbohydrates  that  provide  a large  glycemic  response  has been
hypothesized to increase the risk of NIDDM, whereas dietary fiber is suspected to reduce inci-
dence. These hypotheses have not been evaluated prospectively.

RESEARCH  DESIGN  A ND  METHODS—  We examined the relationship between diet
and risk of NIDDM in a cohort of 42,759 men without NIDDM or cardiovascular disease, who
were 40-75 years of age in 1986. Diet was assessed at baseline by a validated  semiquantitative
food frequency questionnaire. During 6-years of follow-up, 523 incident cases of NIDDM were
documented.

RESULTS —  The dietary glycemic index (an indicator of carbohydrate's ability to raise blood
glucose levels) was positively associated with risk of NIDDM after  adjustment  for age, BMI,
smoking, physical activity, family history of diabetes, alcohol consumption,  cereal fiber, and
total  energy  intake.  Comparing  the highest  and lowest  quintiles,  the relative  risk  (RR)  of
NIDDM was 1.37 (95% CI, 1.02-1.83, P trend = 0.03). Cereal fiber was inversely associated
with risk of NIDDM (RR = 0.70; 95% CI, 0.51-0.96, P trend = 0.007; for >8.1 g/day vs. <3.2
g/day). The combination of a high glycemic load and a low cereal fiber intake further  increased
the risk of NIDDM (RR = 2.17, 95% CI, 1.04-4.54) when compared with a low glycemic load
and high cereal fiber intake.

CONCLUSIONS —  These findings support the hypothesis that diets with  a high glycemic
load and a low cereal fiber content increase risk of NIDDM in men. Further, they suggest that
grains should be consumed in a minimally refined  form to reduce the incidence of NIDDM.

Various  aspects  of  diet  that  increase

insulin resistance or insulin have been
hypothesized,  over  the long  term, to
influence  the risk of NIDDM  (1,2). In par-
ticular, animal fat may increase and dietary
fiber  may  decrease  insulin  levels  (3). In
some clinical studies a beneficial  effect  of a
high-fiber  diet  on  insulin  demand  in
NIDDM subjects has been suggested  (4,5).
Also,  in  metabolic  studies,  carbohydrates
with  a  high  glycemic  index  (a  qualitative
indicator  of carbohydrate's  ability  to  raise
blood  glucose  levels)  appear  to  increase

insulin demand and accentuate  hyperinsu-
linemia  (6,7).  However,  there   are  few
prospective studies addressing the associa-
tion  between  diet   and  risk  of  NIDDM
(2,7,8).  To address  further  the hypothesis
that  diets  with  a  high  glycemic  response
and  low cereal  fiber  content  would  influ-
ence  the incidence  of NIDDM,  we  exam-
ined prospectively the relationship between
specific  dietary  patterns  and  risk  of
NIDDM  in a cohort  of 42,759  men while
controlling  for the major  known  risk fac-
tors.

RESEARCH DESIGN  AND
METHODS

Study  population
The Health Professionals Follow-up Study is
a  national  longitudinal  study  of  diet  and
lifestyle factors in relation to chronic diseases
among 51,529 U.S. male dentists, veterinar-
ians, pharmacists, optometrists, osteopaths,
and podiatrists who were 40-75 years of age
in  1986; 95%  of men  were white  (10). The
participants returned a mailed questionnaire
in  1986 concerning  diet,  medical  history,
and medications. Excluded  from  the analy-
sis were  the men who did not  satisfy  the a
priori criteria of daily caloric intake between
800 and 4,200 kcal or of leaving more  than
70 blanks out of the  131 total food items in
the  diet  questionnaire  (n  =  1,595);  fewer
than 5% had more than  11 blanks. We also
excluded  men who reported  in  1986  dia-
betes,  cancer  (except  nonmelanoma  skin
cancer),  myocardial 
infarction,  angina,
stroke, and coronary artery surgery because
they may have modified  their  diet after the
diagnosis (n = 7,175). One or more of these
exclusions were met by 8,770  participants,
leaving 42,759  eligible men who were fol-
lowed for NIDDM incidence during the sub-
sequent 6 years  (1986-1992).

Dietary  assessment
To assess participants' diets, we used a val-
idated  semiquantitative 
food-frequency
questionnaire  containing  131  food  items
and  beverages  plus  vitamin  supplements
(11,12). We derived for each participant an
average  dietary glycemic  index value.  The
glycemic  index  is  a  method  of  ranking
foods  on the basis  of the incremental glu-
cose  response  and  insulin  demand  they
produce  for  a  given  amount  of  carbohy-
drate  (13,14). As suggested  by Wolever et
al.  (15), we calculated  the average  dietary
glycemic  index  for  each  participant  by
summing the products  of the  carbohydrate
content per serving for each food  times the
average number of servings of that food per
day, times its glycemic index, all divided by
the  total  amount   of  carbohydrate  daily
intake.  Following  a similar  principle, but
without  dividing  by  the  total  amount  of
carbohydrate,  we also  derived  a score  for
the global dietary glycemic load  as an indi-

cator  of  a  glucose  response  or  insulin
demand induced by the total carbohydrate
intake. For both previous calculations, we
used  published  data  for  glycemic  index
values (16,17) and the carbohydrate con-
tent  in  each  serving reported  by  the U.S.
Department of Agriculture (18). To control
for total energy intake, all nutrients as well
as  the  glycemic  index  and  glycemic  load
variables  were  adjusted  for  total  energy
using the residuals method (19).

years  (in  1988,  1990,  and  1992),  we
inquired whether diabetes had been newly
diagnosed.  We  mailed  to  participants
reporting  NIDDM  a supplementary  ques-
tionnaire  to ascertain  the  date and proce-
dure of diagnosis, as well as clinical data and
treatment. We met  the criteria of NIDDM
proposed  by  the  National  Diabetes  Data
Group (22) and the World Health Organi-
zation  (23); the validity of this  procedure
has been previously documented (2).

Measurement  of nondietary  factors
In  1986,  participants  provided  informa-
tion  on  their  age,  weight,  height,  and
smoking  status  (20).  Physical  activity  in
metabolic equivalents per week was com-
puted using the duration per week of vari-
ous  forms  of  exercise,  weighting  each
activity by its intensity level (21). In 1987,
participants provided  information  on his-
tory of NIDDM in 1st degree relatives.

Follow-up and ascertainment of cases
On follow-up questionnaires mailed every 2

Statistical  analysis
For each participant, person-months of fol-
low-up  were  counted  from  the  date  of
return  of  the  1986  questionnaire  to  the
date  of  diabetes  diagnosis,  to death  or  to
January  31,  1992,  whichever  came first.
Relative risks were estimated as odds ratios
using a logistic regression analysis (24). We
tested for monotonic trends with increasing
levels of dietary  factors  by median values
for  each quintile category, modeling these
as a continuous variable in logistic regres-
sion models. All P values are two-sided.

RESULTS —  Among the baseline popu-
lation of 42,759 men, the dietary glycemic
index was positively associated with carbo-
hydrate and cereal fiber intake, and it was
negatively associated with the consumption
of  magnesium,  alcohol,  and  animal  fat
(Table 1). The glycemic index was also pos-
itively  associated  with  the  frequency  of
intake of most  foods  contributing  to total
carbohydrate variation in our cohort (Table
1).  A  similar  pattern  of  association  was
observed with the glycemic load score.

We documented 523 incident cases of
NIDDM during a 6-year follow-up  period
(1986-1992). Total energy intake was not
related to risk of NIDDM after  adjustment
for  age,  obesity,  physical  activity,  alcohol
consumption, smoking, and family history
of NIDDM. Animal fat intake was not asso-
ciated with risk of NIDDM, and vegetable
fat  was  inversely  associated  with  risk  of
NIDDM, although this was not statistically
significant (Table 2). Dietary total fat, satu-
rated, monounsaturated,  and  polyunsatu-
rated  fat  were  not  appreciably  associated
with risk of NIDDM (Table 2), nor was the
polyunsaturated/saturated  fat ratio.

Total  dietary fiber was  not  associated
with  a  significant  reduction  in  risk  of
NIDDM. However, cereal fiber had a signifi-
cant inverse association with risk of NIDDM,
while fruit and vegetable fiber did not (Table
3).  The  association  with  cereal fiber was
observed also after adjustment for other  fiber
sources.  Magnesium,  calcium,  and  potas-
sium  were  all  inversely  related  to risk of
NIDDM, but  only for magnesium was the
trend statistically significant (Table 3).

Total  carbohydrate  intake  was  not
related  to  risk  of  NIDDM,  whereas  the
glycemic  index  was  positively  associated
with  risk,  although 
this  relationship
became  statistically  significant  only  after
adjustment for cereal fiber intake (Table 4).
The glycemic load score was not related to
risk  of  NIDDM  in  the  basic  model,  but
when  adjusted  for  cereal fiber intake  the
glycemic load became positively associated,
although the test for trend was not statisti-
cally significant. We observed a synergistic
relation between glycemic load and cereal
fiber intake when we cross-classified  par-
ticipants by both variables. The relative  risk
was 2.17 (CI 1.04-4.54) for the combina-
tion  of  a  high  glycemic  load  and  a  low
cereal  fiber  intake  compared  with  the
opposite extreme (Fig. 1). The test for inter-
action between the glycemic load and  the
cereal  fiber  intake  was  significant  (P  <
0.001)  in  a  logistic  model  that  included

We  also  examined  the  relationship

carbohydrate  intake  and risk of NIDDM.
Using total carbohydrate intake, however,
does  not  take  into  account  the glycemic
effect or insulin demand of various forms of
carbohydrates. Metabolic studies have doc-
umented  differences  in  insulin  demand
generated  by  various  foods,  depending
largely on the type or degree of digestibility
of the starch content (13,17). The carbohy-

(25), which are mainly from less processed
grain  products  and  dried  legumes  that

CONCLUSIONS—  Our results sug-
gest that the diets with high glycemic load
and low cereal fiber content are positively
associated  with risk of NIDDM, indepen-
dent of other currently known risk factors.
The prospective design of this study avoids
the  possibility  of  biased  recall  of  diet
because all data on food  intake were col-
lected before  the diagnosis of NIDDM. In
our study, self-reported  diabetes was con-
firmed by a supplementary  questionnaire,
and  some  men may have  asymptomatic
undiagnosed  NIDDM.  However,  under-
diagnosis would tend to lead to an under-
estimate  of the true  association  between
dietary factors and diabetes. We also con-
sidered  the  possibility  that  men  with
unhealthy  diets were more likely to have
screening for diabetes. However, the pro-
portion of asymptomatic cases did not vary
appreciably by level of glycemic load score,
magnesium, or dietary fiber intake.

Previous prospective studies (2,8,9) as
well  as the present  analysis  have  consis-
tently found little relationship between total

drate, does describe the quality of carbohy-
drate  but  does  not  take  into  account  the
quantity In contrast, the total glycemic load
represents  the  combination  of  quality  as
well as the quantity of carbohydrate.

In  some  metabolic  studies  among
patients with NIDDM, high-fiber diets have
decreased insulin demand  (4,5). The type
of fiber may be differentially  related to risk
of NIDDM and the amount of dietary  fiber
consumed may modify the insulin demand
that  other  foods  generate  (26).  However,
there are sparse epidemiological data on the
relationship  between  different  types  of
dietary  fiber  intake  and  the  incidence  of
NIDDM, and on the potential interactions
with other dietary factors (2). In our pres-
ent  study,  total  dietary  fiber  was  only
weakly  related  with  risk  of  NIDDM,  but
fiber from cereals had an inverse indepen-
dent relationship to risk of NIDDM.

Hyperinsulinemia,  a  manifestation  of
insulin resistance, is one of the best predic-
tors  of  NIDDM  and  populations  at  high
risk of NIDDM have higher insulin levels
(27).  Diets  with  a  high  glycemic  index
increase  insulin  demand  and  hyperinsu-
linemia  in  patients  with  NIDDM  (6).
Therefore, diets with a high glycemic load
and low cereal fiber are likely to lead to a
chronic  high  demand  for  insulin,  which
may be exacerbated  by insulin resistance.
As long as the pancreas is able to augment
insulin secretion to meet the extra demand,
glucose  tolerance  remains  normal.  But if
the  endocrine  pancreas  fails  to  respond
adequately (relative insulin deficiency), glu-
cose intolerance ensues, eventually leading
to NIDDM (28).

Metabolic  studies  suggest  an  inverse
association  between  intracellular  magne-
sium and insulin resistance (29). A benefi-
cial effect  of magnesium  supplementation
on  insulin  sensitivity  in  patients  with
NIDDM (30) and  in normal subjects  (31)
has also been  established  in small clinical
trials. In a previous analysis of the Nurses'
Health Study (2) and in our present analy-
sis,  we  observed  an  independent  inverse
association between magnesium intake and
risk of NIDDM.

Beyond the well-known risk factors for
NIDDM  of  age,  obesity,  family  history,
sedentary lifestyle,  and smoking, our find-
ings support the hypotheses that diets with
high glycemic load and low cereal fiber con-
sumption increase risk of NIDDM in men,
particularly  when  consumed  in  combina-
tion. Our findings also suggest that magne-
sium may contribute to lower risk associated

with the consumption of whole grain foods.
These findings suggest that grains should be
consumed  in  a minimally  refined  form  to
reduce the incidence of diabetes.

ORIGINAL INVESTIGATION

Fiber and Magnesium Intake and Incidence
of Type 2 Diabetes

A Prospective Study and Meta-analysis

Background: Prospective studies on fiber and magne-
sium intake and risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus were in-
consistent. We examined associations between fiber and
magnesium intake and risk of type 2 diabetes and sum-
marized existing prospective studies by meta-analysis.

Methods: We conducted a prospective cohort study of
9702 men and 15 365 women aged 35 to 65 years who
were observed for incident diabetes from 1994 to 2005.
Dietary intake of fiber and magnesium were measured
with a validated food-frequency questionnaire. We esti-
mated the relative risk (RR) by means of Cox propor-
tional hazards analysis. We searched PubMed through
May 2006 for prospective cohort studies of fiber and mag-
nesium intake and risk of type 2 diabetes. We identified
9 cohort studies of fiber and 8 studies of magnesium in-
take and calculated summary RRs by means of a random-
effects model.

Results: During 176 117 person-years of follow-up, we
observed 844 incident cases of type 2 diabetes in the

European Prospective Investigation Into Cancer and
Nutrition–Potsdam. Higher cereal fiber intake was in-
versely associated with diabetes risk (RR for extreme quin-
tiles, 0.72 [95% confidence interval [CI], 0.56-0.93]), while
fruit fiber (0.89 [95% CI, 0.70-1.13]) and vegetable fiber
(0.93 [95% CI, 0.74-1.17]) were not significantly associ-
ated. Meta-analyses showed a reduced diabetes risk with
higher cereal fiber intake (RR for extreme categories, 0.67
[95% CI, 0.62-0.72]), but no significant associations for fruit
(0.96 [95% CI, 0.88-1.04]) and vegetable fiber (1.04 [95%
CI, 0.94-1.15]). Magnesium intake was not related to dia-
betes risk in the European Prospective Investigation Into
Cancer and Nutrition–Potsdam (RR for extreme quin-
tiles, 0.99 [95% CI, 0.78-1.26]); however, meta-analysis
showed a significant inverse association (RR for extreme
categories, 0.77 [95% CI, 0.72-0.84]).

Conclusion: Higher cereal fiber and magnesium in-
takes may decrease diabetes risk.

T HE PREDICTED INCREASE IN

diabetes mellitus preva-
lence from 171 million in-
dividuals diagnosed as hav-
ing diabetes worldwide in
2000 to 370 million by the year 20301 and
the alarming projections in terms of asso-
ciated morbidities and mortality,2 as well
as health care costs,3 emphasize the need
for preventive action. Current guidelines
for the prevention of type 2 diabetes by the
American Diabetes Association4 and the
European Association for the Study of Dia-
betes5 include goals for total dietary fiber
intake. It has been suggested that the ben-
efits of increased fiber intake result prin-
cipally from the greater consumption of
soluble forms6 due to effects on gastric
emptying, macronutrient absorption,
and reduced postprandial glucose re-
sponses.7-9 Insoluble fiber may reduce dia-
betes risk by the production of short-
chain fatty acids in the colon and their

effect on hepatic insulin sensitivity.10,11
However, although prospective studies
have observed reduced diabetes risk with
high cereal fiber and whole grain con-
sumption,12-20 these findings have not been
confirmed by all studies,16,21 and benefi-
cial effects of fruit and vegetable fiber re-
main unclear so far. In addition, while
magnesium deficiency is plausibly linked
to diabetes,22 the absence of clinical trials
and the inconsistency among prospec-
tive studies regarding the role of magne-
sium in diabetes prevention14,21,23-25 pre-
clude definitive recommendations at
present.5

The aims of this study were to evaluate
the association between total, cereal, fruit,
and vegetable fiber, as well as soluble and
insoluble fiber and magnesium intake, and
risk of type 2 diabetes in a large prospec-
tive cohort study of men and women and
to summarize the existing evidence from
prospective studies by meta-analysis.

STUDY POPULATIONS

The European Prospective Investigation Into Cancer and Nu-
trition (EPIC)–Potsdam study is part of the multicenter pro-
spective cohort study EPIC.26,27 In Potsdam, Germany, 27 548
subjects, 16 644 women aged mainly 35 to 65 years and 10 904
men aged mainly 40 to 65 years, from the general population
were recruited between 1994 and 1998.28 The baseline exami-
nation included anthropometric measurements and a self-
administered validated food-frequency questionnaire, as well
as a personal interview including questions on prevalent dis-
eases and a questionnaire on sociodemographic and lifestyle
characteristics. Follow-up questionnaires have been adminis-
tered every 2 to 3 years to identify incident cases of diabetes
mellitus. Response rates for follow-up rounds 1, 2, and 3 ex-
ceed 90%. We also considered questionnaires within the on-
going fourth follow-up round sent out until January 31, 2005,
of which 96.2% were returned by August 31, 2005.

The prevalence of diabetes mellitus at baseline was evalu-
ated by a physician using information on self-reported medi-
cal diagnoses, medication records, and dieting behavior. Un-
certainties regarding a proper diagnosis were clarified with the
participant or treating physician. After exclusion of partici-
pants with prevalent diabetes at baseline or with self-reported
diabetes during follow-up but without physician confirma-
tion (n=1567), with missing follow-up time (n=589), with miss-
ing diet and confounder information at baseline (n=226), or
with implausible energy intake (⬍800 or ⬎6000 kcal/d; n=99),
9702 men and 15 365 women remained for analyses.

Informed consent was obtained from all participants of the
study, and approval was given by the Ethical Committee of the
State of Brandenburg, Germany.

DIETARY ASSESSMENT

All participants were asked to complete a semiquantitative food-
frequency questionnaire. This questionnaire assessed the av-
erage frequency of intake and the portion size of 148 foods con-
sumed during the 12 months before examination. Frequency
of intake was measured using 10 categories, ranging from “never”
to “5 times per day or more.” Portion sizes were estimated with
the use of photographs of standard portion sizes. Information
on frequency of intake and portion size was used to calculate
the amount of each food in grams consumed on average per
day. Intakes of fiber and magnesium were estimated on the ba-
sis of the German Food Code and Nutrient Data Base,29 ver-
sion II.3, and adjusted for total energy intake by the residual
method.30 The validity and reproducibility of the food-
frequency questionnaire have been described previously.31-33
Briefly, the corrected correlation coefficients between food-
frequency questionnaire and twelve 24-h dietary recalls for en-
ergy-adjusted intake of total fiber was 0.66.31

ASCERTAINMENT OF TYPE 2 DIABETES

Potentially incident cases of diabetes were identified via self-
reports of a diabetes diagnosis, diabetes-relevant medication,
or dietary treatment owing to diabetes. All potentially inci-
dent cases were verified by questionnaires mailed to the diag-
nosing physician asking about the date and type of diagnosis,
diagnostic tests, and treatment of diabetes. Only cases with a
physician diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus (International
Statistical Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, E11) and a
diagnosis date after the baseline examination were considered
as confirmed incident cases of type 2 diabetes.

ASSESSMENT OF LIFESTYLE EXPOSURES

Information on educational attainment, smoking, occupa-
tional activity level, and leisure-time physical activity were as-
sessed with a self-administered questionnaire and a personal
interview. We considered sports activities and biking as leisure-
time activities, both calculated as the average time spent per
week during the 12 months before baseline recruitment. An-
thropometric measurement procedures followed standard pro-
tocols under strict quality control.34,35

STATISTICAL ANALYSES

We estimated the relative risk (RR) for each quintile of energy-
adjusted fiber and magnesium intake compared with the low-
est quintile by means of Cox proportional hazards analysis strati-
fied by age. Age was used as the primary time-dependent variable
in all models, with entry time defined as the subject’s age at
recruitment and exit time as the date of diagnosis of diabetes
(International Statistical Classification of Diseases, 10th Revi-
sion, E10, E11, E13, and E14), death, or return of the last fol-
low-up questionnaire. We used information on covariates ob-
tained from the baseline examination in multivariate analyses,
including sex, body mass index, waist circumference, educa-
tional achievement (no vocational training or in training, vo-
cational training, technical school, technical college, or uni-
versity degree), occupational activity (light, moderate, or heavy),
sports activity (0, 0.1-4.0, or ⬎4.0 h/wk), cycling (0, 0.1-2.4,
2.5-4.9, or ⱖ5 h/wk), smoking (never, past, current ⬍20 ciga-
rettes per day, or current ⱖ20 cigarettes per day), total energy
intake, alcohol intake, carbohydrate intake, and the ratios of
polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fatty acids to satu-
rated fatty acids in the diet. The significance of linear trends
across quintiles of fiber and magnesium intake was tested by
assigning each participant the median value for the quintile and
modeling this value as a continuous variable.36 Because risk es-
timates were similar for men and women, we pooled both sexes
in our analyses. These statistical analyses were performed with
SAS statistical software, release 9.1 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC).

META-ANALYSES

We conducted separate meta-analyses for different fiber sources
and magnesium by means of Review Manager, version 4.2 (Co-
penhagen, Denmark, Nordic Cochrane Centre, The Cochrane Col-
laboration, 2003). Studies were identified by searching PubMed
through May 2006 for the terms magnesium, fiber or fibre, and
diabetes and by reviewing references of published studies and re-
views. Studies were included if they were prospective cohort stud-
ies on type 2 diabetes. For studies reporting RRs for continuous
intake, estimates for categories were obtained from study authors.
For all meta-analyses, data were extracted by 2 investigators from
multivariate-adjusted models. Summary RRs were random ef-
fects estimates, which allow each of the studies in the meta-
analysis to estimate a different effect size.

RESULTS

Baseline characteristics by quintiles of total fiber intake
are shown in Table 1. Participants with higher fiber in-
take were more likely to be women, engaged more fre-
quently in sports activities and cycling, and were less likely
to smoke. With regard to dietary characteristics, higher
fiber consumption was related to higher intake of car-
bohydrates and magnesium and lower alcohol intake and
a more favorable fatty acid profile.

*Data are given as means or percentages.

During 176 117 person-years of follow-up (mean, 7.0
years), we observed 844 incident cases of type 2 diabe-
tes mellitus (491 men and 353 women). In all, 31.2% of
cases were treated by diet only, 24.4% by oral agents only,
35.8% by diet and oral agents, and the remaining 8.6%
by insulin alone or in combination with diet and/or oral
agents. After adjustment for age, sex, education, activ-
ity, anthropometric measures, and other individual char-
acteristics, neither magnesium nor total fiber intake was
associated with risk of developing type 2 diabetes
(Table 2). Intake of soluble fiber was inversely associ-
ated with diabetes risk in a multivariate model (RR for
extreme quintiles, 0.79; 95% confidence interval [CI],
0.63-0.98); however, this association was no longer sig-
nificant after adjustment for dietary confounders and at-
tenuated with additional adjustment for insoluble fiber
intake (RR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.57-1.22). Insoluble fiber in-
take was not significantly associated with diabetes risk
after adjustment for confounders.

We further evaluated different sources of dietary
fiber. Cereal fiber was correlated with consumption of
whole-grain bread (r = 0.71) and muesli (r = 0.34) in
EPIC-Potsdam. In addition, cereal fiber was highly cor-
related with intake of soluble (r=0.82) and insoluble
(r=0.72) fiber, while these associations were moderate
for fruit fiber (r=0.43 and 0.55, respectively) and veg-
etable fiber (r=0.33 and 0.47, respectively). Cereal fiber
intake was inversely associated with diabetes risk

(Table 3). The RR for extreme quintiles was 0.73
(95% CI, 0.57-0.94) after adjustment for lifestyle and
dietary confounders. This association remained similar
after adjustment for other fiber sources. In contrast, nei-
ther fruit nor vegetable fiber was significantly related to
diabetes risk. Similar to the finding for cereal fiber,
higher whole-grain bread intake was inversely associ-
ated with diabetes risk. The RR for extreme quintiles
(ⱖ80.2 vs ⬍4.4 g/d) was 0.78 (95% CI, 0.62-0.97),
after adjustment for age, sex, lifestyle confounders,
anthropometry, and dietary fat quality. This association
remained essentially unchanged with additional adjust-
ment for the intake of carbohydrates and magnesium
(RR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.61-0.99).

We conducted separate meta-analyses for different
fiber sources and magnesium. In addition to our study,
we were able to identify 8 previous publications on
cereal, vegetable, and/or fruit fiber intake12-18,21 and 5 on
magnesium intake.14,21,23-25 The same study population
was investigated with regard to cereal fiber consump-
tion in 2 publications,12,15 and we used data from the
most recent publication only, with longer follow-up
and a larger number of cases.15 Publications from the
Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study16,23 reported
separate associations for black and white participants,
which we treated as separate cohorts. One publication
involved 2 different cohorts.24 This resulted in a total of
9 cohort studies on fiber intake and 8 on magnesium

nesium intake compared with the lowest category. The
RR of type 2 diabetes for all cohort studies combined
was 0.67 (95% CI, 0.62-0.72) for cereal fiber, 0.96 (95%
CI, 0.88-1.04) for fruit fiber, 1.04 (95% CI, 0.94-1.15)
for vegetable fiber, and 0.77 (95% CI, 0.72-0.84) for
magnesium. The P values for heterogeneity in results
were .04, .50, .59, and .04, respectively. A test for
heterogeneity in the meta-analysis on magnesium
intake was nonsignificant after exclusion of the 2 Ath-
erosclerosis Risk in Communities study cohorts23 for
which RRs were reported comparing quartiles (com-
bined RR after exclusion, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.70-0.82; P for
heterogeneity=.08). A test for heterogeneity was bor-
derline significant for cereal fiber after exclusion of the
study by Montonen et al,17 for which RRs were reported
comparing quartiles (combined RR after exclusion,
0.68; 95% CI, 0.62-0.73; P for heterogeneity = .05).
Exclusion of the study contributing the largest number

of cases to the meta-analysis on cereal fiber15 did not
appreciably change the result (combined RR after
exclusion, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.65-0.79); however, a test for
heterogeneity was no longer significant (P=.14).

COMMENT

We found that higher cereal fiber intake was associated
with a reduced risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus indepen-
dent of age, sex, and lifestyle risk factors. Intake of fruit
or vegetable fiber and magnesium were not significantly
associated with diabetes risk. Meta-analyses of cohort stud-
ies showed an inverse association for cereal fiber and mag-
nesium, but no beneficial effect of other fiber sources.
It has been suggested that the benefits of increased fi-
ber intake result principally from the greater consump-
tion of soluble forms.6 Consumption of soluble fiber has

Figure. Relative risks (RRs) for the association between cereal fiber (A), fruit fiber (B), vegetable fiber (C), and magnesium (D) consumption and risk of type 2
diabetes mellitus for individual cohort studies and all cohort studies combined. CI indicates confidence interval; NA, not available. In a 1997 publication (Salmero´n
et al12) from the cohort studied by Hu et al,15 the median intake of energy-adjusted cereal fiber intake was 7.5 g/d in the highest and 2.0 g/d in the lowest quintile.

tion and reduces postprandial glucose responses.7-9 This
contradicts the observation from previous prospective
studies that insoluble fiber, but not soluble fiber, is in-

versely related to diabetes risk.14,17 In our study, there was
no major difference between both fiber forms in terms
of RRs for quintiles, although the intake of soluble fiber
was substantially lower than that of insoluble fiber, simi-

fore that the quantity of soluble fiber consumed in an av-
erage diet is insufficient to have a distinguishable effect
on glycemic control.37 The mechanisms by which in-
soluble fiber may lead to a reduced diabetes risk are largely
unknown.37,38 A potential mechanism relates to the pro-
duction of short-chain fatty acids in the colon and their
effect on hepatic insulin sensitivity.10,11 Eating insoluble
fiber–enriched white bread for 3 days significantly im-
proved whole-body insulin sensitivity in overweight and
obese women compared with regular white bread.39 How-
ever, studies on wheat bran–rich insoluble fiber among
patients with type 2 diabetes or impaired glucose toler-
ance are conflicting.40-42

Our meta-analysis showed strong evidence that high ce-
real fiber intake reduces the risk of developing type 2 dia-
betes. Whole-grain and bran products from wheat and corn
are the major source of cereal fiber in US cohorts43 and typi-
cally contain insoluble fiber. In our cohort, as well as in a
Finnish cohort,17 rye bread plays an important role in ce-
real fiber consumption with a higher proportion of soluble
fiber.Ryebreadhasalsobeenshowntoresultinalowerpost-
prandial insulin response compared with wheat bread in-
dependent of its fiber content.44 Cereal fiber was highly cor-
relatedwithwhole-grainbreadintakeinEPIC-Potsdam,and
it is likely that cereal fiber is a marker for whole-grain foods,
which have also been shown to relate to a lower diabetes risk
in prospective studies.14,17,19,20 Components in whole grains
that may be protective in addition to fiber include resistant
starch,oligosaccharides,tracemineralslikemagnesium,phe-
nolic compounds, and phytoestrogens.45,46 Although this
might explain in part the beneficial effect, cereal fiber was
associated with diabetes risk independent of magnesium in
EPIC-Potsdam and a previous cohort.18 Hypomagnesemia
has been associated with a reduction of tyrosine kinase ac-
tivity at the insulin receptor level, which may result in the
impairment of insulin action and development of insulin re-
sistance22 and is a common feature of patients with type 2
diabetes.47 Our meta-analysis showed a significant inverse
association between magnesium intake and risk of type 2
diabetes. Still, magnesium intake was not related to diabe-
tesriskinEPIC-Potsdam,andtherewassuggestionofhetero-
geneity across studies.

All potential cases in our study were verified through
the treating physician. However, we considered only clini-
cally apparent type 2 diabetes and did not screen our study
population for diabetes at baseline; thus, it is possible that
prevalent but undiagnosed cases of diabetes remained in
our analyses. The glycemic index, a measure of carbo-
hydrate quality in terms of quantified glucose response
to foods, is not available in the German Food Code and
Nutrient Data Base version II.3, and we were not able to
address whether the association between fiber and mag-
nesium intake and diabetes risk is independent or may
be modified by the glycemic index. The potential of re-
sidual confounding applies similarly to our study and the
cohort studies included in our meta-analysis. Thus, it is
possible that other factors may explain the inverse asso-
ciations between cereal fiber and magnesium intake and
diabetes risk or that they may mask a potential associa-
tion with fruit or vegetable fiber. It is possible that par-
ticipants in our study changed their dietary intake after

the baseline measurement. The lack of repeated mea-
surement of diet may have led to an underestimation of
association.48

With the exception of the study by Montonen et al,17
all studies included in our meta-analyses estimated di-
etary intake on the basis of semiquantitative food-
frequency questionnaires. Food-frequency question-
naires work well in ranking individuals with regard to
their intake, but they are not suitable tools for quantify-
ing dietary intake in absolute terms.49 In addition, the in-
take of fiber and magnesium has been energy-adjusted
by the residuals method30 in our study and several other
cohort studies12-16,18,25 which results in an underestima-
tion of variance of intake. This, in addition to differ-
ences in questionnaire design, limits the comparability
of questionnaire data across studies and their interpre-
tation in quantitative terms. This also hampers the ap-
plication of meta-analysis techniques more suitable for
studies that report separate RRs for several risk classes.50-52
Healthier eating was encouraged in all previous ran-
domized prevention studies,53-56 but the frequent con-
sumption of whole-grain foods was specifically men-
tioned only in the Finnish diabetes prevention study.54
Owing to changes in several components of the diet, ac-
tivity patterns, and a targeted weight reduction, it is not
possible to determine to what extent the increased in-
take of whole-grain foods might have contributed to the
reduced risk of diabetes observed in these studies. For
example, in the Finnish diabetes prevention study, about
twice the number in the intervention group (25%) com-
pared with the control group (12%) met the goal of fi-
ber intake (ⱖ15 g/1000 kcal), although the proportion
was considerably lower compared with weight reduc-
tion (43% vs 13%), fat intake (47% vs 26%), and exer-
cise (86% vs 71%).54 Increased fiber intake was not sig-
nificantly associated with diabetes risk in this study
independent of reductions in total fat intake.57 At present,
scientific evidence therefore relies largely on prospec-
tive observational studies. This evidence should be sup-
ported by studies clarifying the mechanisms by which ce-
real fiber may be linked to reduced diabetes risk.

In conclusion, the evidence from our study and pre-
vious studies, summarized by means of meta-analysis,
strongly supports that higher cereal fiber and magne-
sium intake may decrease diabetes risk. Whole-grain foods
are therefore important in diabetes prevention.

The aim of diabetes management is to normalise blood glucose levels since improved blood glucose control is associated with fewer complications.
Food affects blood glucose levels; however, there is no universal approach to the optimal diabetic diet and there is controversy about the usefulness
of the low-glycaemic index (GI) diet. To assess the effects of low-GI diets on glycaemic control in diabetes, we conducted electronic searches of
the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL. We assessed randomised controlled trials (RCT) with interventions . 4 weeks that
compared a low-GI diet with a higher-GI diet for type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Twelve RCT (n 612) were identiﬁed. There was a signiﬁcant decrease
in glycated Hb (HbA1c) with low-GI diet than with the control diet, indicating improved glycaemic control (seven trials, n 457, weighted mean
difference (WMD) 2 0·4 % HbA1c, 95 % CI 2 0·7, 2 0·20, P¼ 0·001). In four studies reporting the results for glycaemic control as fructosamine,
three of which were 6 weeks or less in duration, pooled data showed a decrease in fructosamine (WMD 2 0·23 mmol/l, 95 % CI 2 0·47, 0·00,
P¼ 0·05), n 141, with low-GI diet than with high-GI diet. Glycosylated albumin levels decreased signiﬁcantly with low-GI diet, but not with
high-GI diet, in one study that reported this outcome. Lowering the GI of the diet may contribute to improved glycaemic control in diabetes.

is estimated that

Over 180 million people worldwide have diabetes, and if this
health problem is not addressed,
this
number will more than double by 2030(1). The increasing
prevalence of type 2 diabetes is associated with the obesity
epidemic, and diagnosis is occuring at increasingly younger
ages(2). The aim of diabetes management
is to normalise
blood glucose levels since improved blood glucose control
is associated with a reduction in the development and
progression of metabolic and other complications including
retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy and CVD(3). Nutritional
factors affect blood glucose levels; however, there is currently
no universally agreed approach to the dietary management of
diabetes(4). Different carbohydrate (CHO) foods can be ranked
by their overall effect on blood glucose levels using the
glycaemic index (GI)(5). By contributing a gradual supply of
glucose to the bloodstream, and hence stimulating lower,
more sustained insulin release, low-GI foods such as lentils,
beans and oats may contribute to improved glycaemic control
compared with high-GI foods, such as white bread(5). Low-GI
diets may also increase insulin sensitivity by minimising
ﬂuctuations in blood glucose levels and reducing the secretion
of insulin over the day(6).

There is controversy about the utility of a low-GI diet in
meal planning for people with diabetes. The authors of one
Cochrane systematic review concluded that there were no
high-quality data on the efﬁcacy of diet alone for the treatment
of type 2 diabetes(7), but low-GI diets were not considered in
that review. In another review, it was concluded that low-GI
diets exert a small, but clinically useful, effect on medium-
in diabetes(8), and other reviews
term glycaemic control
have addressed related health issues(9 – 12).

The most recent position statement from the American
Diabetes Association maintains that glycaemic control
is
best attained by monitoring total CHO intake via CHO count-
ing, CHO exchange or experience-based estimation, and that
use of a low-GI diet may provide only a modest secondary
beneﬁt above consideration of total CHO alone(4).

The aim of this systematic review was to assess the
low-GI diets primarily on glycaemic control
effects of
(measured by glycated Hb (HbA1c), fructosamine or glycated
serum albumin (GSA)) in people with diabetes. It
is an
updated version of a Cochrane review by the same authors(13),
including a more recent
large-scale randomised controlled
trial (RCT).

Methods

Identiﬁcation of studies

We conducted electronic searches of the Cochrane Library
(issue 1, 2009), MEDLINE (1950 to March 2009), EMBASE
(1988 to March 2009) and CINAHL (1982 to March 2009).
We used a search strategy, with no restriction on language,
that
included the identiﬁcation of any relevant systematic
reviews and meta-analyses as well as the identiﬁcation of
eligible studies(13).

Studies eligible for inclusion were RCT with an interven-
tion lasting 4 weeks or longer, which compared a low-GI
diet with a higher GI diet for people with diabetes. Studies
were excluded if the intervention was only a generalised
recommendation to increase the proportion of low-GI foods
in the diet without provision of explicit detail; if the interven-
tion was either not directly supervised or well-documented,
for example, through the use of food diaries or the provision
of food; if there was a co-intervention in the experimental
group that was not applied to the control group also; or
if the diabetes was already optimally controlled at the start
of the study (participants had HbA1c levels , 6·5 %).

of Hb(14,15). The turnover of human serum albumin is much
shorter (half-life 14 – 20 d) than that of Hb (erythrocyte life
span 120 d), so the degree of glycation of serum proteins
(mostly albumin), indicated by fructosamine or GSA, better
reﬂects the level of glycaemia over short time periods than
does glycation of Hb(14). Nevertheless, it has been reported
that measurements of total glycated serum protein and GSA
correlate well with one another and with measurements of
HbA1c(14).

Secondary outcomes of interest included adverse effects,

insulin action and quality of life.

Selection of studies

Two reviewers independently reviewed the abstracts from
the literature searches to identify potentially eligible studies.
Any study that did not fulﬁl the deﬁned inclusion criteria was
eliminated, i.e. it was not an RCT, did not involve people with
diabetes, had no comparator, included a co-intervention in
only one arm or had an intervention period of , 4 weeks
(Fig. 1)(16).

Outcome measures

Quality assessment

HbA1c was used as the main measure of glycaemic control
(the primary outcome of interest) for studies where the inter-
vention lasted more than 6 weeks. Fructosamine or GSA levels
were used, when provided, as the measure of glycaemic
control for studies if the intervention lasted 6 weeks or less,
since in this time frame, fructosamine or GSA levels are
more reliable indicators of glycaemic control than glycation

Two reviewers independently assessed the quality of each
included trial based on speciﬁc criteria(17,18), namely mini-
misation of selection bias, attrition bias and detection bias.
In dietary intervention studies, blinding of participants and
investigators is generally difﬁcult, hence blinding was not
included as a quality criterion. Blinding of outcome assessors,
where mentioned, was recorded.

We tested for heterogeneity between trial results using the
standard x2 test to examine whether any variation in study
results could be due to the variation expected by chance
alone, with signiﬁcance level set at a¼ 0·1. Quantiﬁcation
of the effect of heterogeneity was assessed by means of
I 2(19). Publication bias was assessed by examining funnel
plot asymmetry(20,21).

Statistical analysis

Participants

All data were initially analysed using a ﬁxed effect model.
Meta-analysis of trial results was done when appropriate,
that is if data were available from more than one trial, and
results were sufﬁciently homogeneous and of
sufﬁcient
quality. For dichotomous outcomes, we had planned to express
effect size in terms of relative risk with 95 % CI, but no
relevant dichotomous outcomes were
reported in the
included trials.

Results

Description of studies

From the initial search, 2944 records were identiﬁed. From the
abstracts of these records, we identiﬁed thirty-three papers for
examination of the full text. The other studies were excluded
because they were not relevant to the question under study
in this review; they were duplicate papers; some or all the
participants did not have diabetes; they had no control group
or no randomisation; they did not compare similar groups;
there was a co-intervention that was not applied to both
groups or the duration of the intervention was , 4 weeks.
All twelve studies identiﬁed for inclusion in the review were
RCT(22 – 33). They were conducted in Australia(22,23,27,29),
Canada(32,33), France(24,31), Italy(26), Mexico(28), Thailand(30)
and UK(25). The duration of the dietary intervention ranged
from 4(29 – 31) to 52 weeks(27).

Quality of studies

No trial included in the review reported any signiﬁcant differ-
ences between characteristics of participants in the treatment
groups at baseline. Although all

The twelve included studies involved a total of 612 participants.
Three studies had participants with type 1 diabetes(23,26,27),
eight studies had participants with type 2 diabetes(22,25,28 – 33),
and one study had participants with either type 1 or type 2
diabetes(24). Two studies involved children, all of whom had
type 1 diabetes(23,27).

Interventions

Ten studies compared the low-GI diet
to a higher-GI
diet(22 – 26,28 – 32). In one study, the control diet was a measured
CHO exchange diet(27), and in another study, the control diet
was a high-cereal ﬁbre diet (Table 1)(33).

Glycaemic control

Data were pooled from the seven studies that reported on
HbA1c, the primary outcome of interest, in participants whose
HbA1c was not optimised at baseline (n 457)(22,26 – 28,30,31,33)
(Fig. 2). Compared with people who received higher GI diets,
there was a signiﬁcant decrease in % HbA1c levels in people
who received low-GI diets, indicating improved glycaemic
control in the low-GI group (WMD 2 0·4 % HbA1c, 95 %
CI 2 0·7, 2 0·2, P¼ 0·001) (Fig. 2). In the study that compared
a low-GI diet with a CHO exchange diet, the mean HbA1c
level had decreased signiﬁcantly by 12 months in the low-
GI group than in the CHO exchange group (P¼ 0·05)(27).
Twice as many participants in the low-GI group (45 %)
attained acceptable HbA1c levels than participants in the
CHO exchange group (22 %; P¼ 0·02 after adjustment for
baseline values).

In the four studies reporting the results for glycaemic
control as fructosamine (n 141), three were 6 weeks or less
in duration(24,25,29,32). Pooled data showed a decrease in

Low-glycaemic index diets for diabetes

Discussion

review provides evidence that

This
low-GI diets can
signiﬁcantly improve diabetic control in less than optimally
controlled people with diabetes. Low-GI diets lower %
HbA1c levels by 0·4 % compared with comparison diets.
This decrease is clinically signiﬁcant, and is comparable
to the decrease achieved through medications for newly
diagnosed type 2 diabetes(34,35). In the industry guide on
diabetes drug development, the US Department of Health(36)
states that a 0·3 % reduction in HbA1c is clinically meaning-
ful. Improvements of this size have been associated with a
reduction in the risk of microvascular complications(3). The
UK Prospective Diabetes Study Group found that any
reduction in HbA1c was likely to reduce the risk of compli-
cations, and that each 1 % reduction in HbA1c was associated
with a reduction in risk of 21 % (95 % CI 17, 24 %,
P, 0·0001) for any end point related to diabetes and a
reduction in risk of 37 % (95 % CI 33, 41 %, P, 0·0001) for
microvascular complications(3).

Two studies were conducted in children, all of whom had
type 1 diabetes. Studies conducted in children with longer
follow-up periods would be useful to determine the impact
of low-GI diets on both overall quality of life and long-term
glycaemic control.

Although all the included studies were RCT, some had
methodological
limitations including failure to report on
allocation concealment and lack of outcome assessor blinding.
Participants in the included trials were both adults and
children with diabetes, suggesting that the results would be
relevant to a broad spectrum of age groups in other similar
communities. Studies included people with either type 1 or
type 2 diabetes, or both, and hence the results of the review
have relevance to both types of diabetes. None of the trials
were conducted in developing countries.

to other

the meta-analysis showed that

Two studies included in the meta-analysis compared a
low-GI diet
treatment diets: a measured CHO
exchange diet(27) and a high-cereal ﬁbre diet(33). Even with
these studies included,
the
low-GI diet improved HbA1c levels compared with compari-
son diets. In the study that compared a low-GI diet with a
measured CHO exchange diet, involving children with type 1
diabetes(27), twice as many participants in the low-GI group
than those in the CHO exchange group exhibited acceptable
HbA1c levels at 12 months without any increase in the rate
of hypoglycaemic occurrences. Hence, even when compared
to a measured CHO exchange diet, the low-GI diet resulted
in greater improvement in glycaemic control.

Although insulin is the mainstay of treatment for type 1 dia-
betes, our review suggests that a low-GI diet can be a useful
adjunctive treatment, as it improved HbA1c levels in both
the studies conducted in children with type 1 diabetes(23,27).
In type 2 diabetes, insulin sensitivity was affected by the GI
of the diet, signiﬁcantly increasing in the low-GI group than in
the high-GI group(31). This improvement may beneﬁt patients
with diabetes by lessening, or even avoiding, their requirement
for medication. In a study where medications were adjusted as
necessary, signiﬁcantly less diabetic medication was required
in people with type 2 diabetes on the low-GI diet than in
those on the American Diabetes Association-recommended
diet to achieve equivalent control of HbA1c levels(37).

Low-GI diets have also been reported as causing greater
weight loss in overweight or obese people compared with
control diets, as well as improving lipid proﬁles. Low-GI
diets resulted in signiﬁcant decreases in body mass, total fat
mass, BMI, total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol compared
with control diets(38).

Further research should investigate the effect of incorporat-
ing low-GI diets into the lifestyles of people with diabetes,
because there is some indication that these diets may improve
quality of life(27). There is evidence to support the use of
a low-GI diet as a long-term maintenance diet. A recent
study conducted in participants with type 2 diabetes and
optimised HbA1c levels at baseline showed that maintenance
of steady HbA1c levels and sustained reductions in both
postprandial glucose and C-reactive protein were more often
achieved in participants on a low-GI diet than in controls
at 12 months(39). Studies with longer follow-up periods are
required to determine the feasibility of
incorporating a
low-GI diet as part of a lifestyle, and the potential beneﬁts
for quality of life and long-term glycaemic control.

Lowering the GI of the diet appears to be an effective
method to improve glycaemic control
in diabetes, and
should be considered as part of the overall strategy of diabetes
management.

ABSTRACT
Objective To investigate the independent effects of intake
of fruit and vegetables on incidence of type 2 diabetes.
Design Systematic review and meta-analysis.
Data sources Medline, Embase, CINAHL, British Nursing
Index (BNI), and the Cochrane library were searched for
medical subject headings and keywords on diabetes,
prediabetes, fruit, and vegetables. Expert opinions were
sought and reference lists of relevant articles checked.
Study selection Prospective cohort studies with an
independent measure of intake of fruit, vegetables, or
fruit and vegetables and data on incidence of type 2
diabetes.
Results Six studies met the inclusion criteria; four of these
studies also provided separate information on the
consumption of green leafy vegetables. Summary
estimates showed that greater intake of green leafy
vegetables was associated with a 14% (hazard ratio 0.86,
95% confidence interval 0.77 to 0.97) reduction in risk of
type 2 diabetes (P=0.01). The summary estimates showed
no significant benefits of increasing the consumption of
vegetables, fruit, or fruit and vegetables combined.
Conclusion Increasing daily intake of green leafy
vegetables could significantly reduce the risk of type 2
diabetes and should be investigated further.

INTRODUCTION
The prevalence of diabetes is currently estimated to be
about 6.4% worldwide,1 and in the past two decades
alone there has been a dramatic increase in the diagno-
sis of type 2 diabetes.1 Dietary factors are important
and are potentially modifiable risk factors. There has
been a focus on the role of carbohydrates and fibre,2 3
but the relation between fruit and vegetable intake and
incidence of type 2 diabetes is not fully understood. A
recent meta-analysis concluded that there is over-
whelming support for the benefit of lifestyle inter-
ventions to prevent type 2 diabetes.4 Several of these
intervention studies have included the promotion of
fruit and vegetables in the diet.5-8 Low consumption
of fruit and vegetables, however, is common through-
out the world.9 In 2002 the National Diet and Nutrition
Survey showed that 86% of all men and women in the
United Kingdom consumed
the

than

less

recommended five portions of fruit and vegetables a
day, with 62% consuming less than three portions.10
It was estimated that inadequate consumption of fruit
and vegetables could have accounted for 2.6 million
deaths worldwide in the year 2000.11

High intake of fruit and vegetables has been asso-
ciated with a reduced incidence of cancer and cardio-
vascular disease.12 13 Diabetes is a strong independent
risk factor for cardiovascular disease,14 and often the
conditions exist together, sharing common modifiable
risk factors.15 As yet no firm conclusions have been
made as to whether increasing intake of fruit and vege-
tables can decrease the risk of type 2 diabetes itself,
given the abundance of conflicting evidence within
the literature. The exact mechanisms by which fruit
and vegetables reduce the risk of these chronic diseases
are not precisely known. A combination of anti-
oxidants and phytochemicals found in fruit and vege-
tables might promote health by combating free
radicals, which are linked with early phase develop-
ment of some chronic diseases.16 High intakes of fruit
and vegetables have been shown to increase concentra-
tion of plasma carotenoids and vitamin C,17 18 both of
which have antioxidant properties. An increase in fruit
and vegetables in the diet of people with type 2 diabetes
can also lower markers of oxidative stress.19

A previous review in 2007 concluded that consump-
tion of three or more servings of fruit and vegetables a
day was not associated with a substantial reduction in
the risk of type 2 diabetes.20 This review was restricted
by language and searched only a small number of elec-
tronic databases. In addition, recent studies have been
published that could further contribute to the pooled
data and allow further investigation into any associa-
tion.

METHODS
Search strategy
In consultation with the research team we used the
Cochrane handbook21 and the guide to systematic
reviews
and
Dissemination22 to develop a systematic review proto-
col. To ensure a broad search, the search strategy
included the medical subject headings (type 2 diabetes,

prediabetes, impaired glucose tolerance, impaired fast-
ing glucose, fruits, vegetables, citrus, follow-up, and
prospective studies). Text word, title word, abstract,
and subject headings were also searched for the
above terms plus several non-medical subject headings
to cover fruit, vegetables, and diabetes.

We searched OVID Medline(R), in process and
other non-indexed citations, and OVID Medline(R),
1950 to February 2009; Embase, 1980 to March
2009; the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied
Health Literature (CINAHL) and the British Nursing
Index (BNI), from inception (1981 and 1985, respec-
tively) until March 2009, via NLH Search 2.0; and
three databases in the Cochrane Library (CDSR,
CENTRAL, DARE) from inception to issue 1, 2009.
We sought expert opinion and checked references in
any articles that met the inclusion criteria. There were
no language restrictions.

Study selection
To be included, studies had to be prospective cohort
studies that included an individual measure of intake of
fruits, vegetables, or fruit and vegetable and an assess-
ment of the development of type 2 diabetes. One
reviewer (PC) performed the search and reviewed the
results. Studies that did not meet the inclusion criteria
were discarded during the initial review. When uncer-
tainty existed we retrieved and assessed the full text
article. Two reviewers (PC and JT) independently
assessed all potentially relevant studies and resolved
any uncertainty through discussion. No relevant
papers were found in languages other than English.

Validity assessment
Two authors (PC and JT) independently assessed all
studies for quality. A scoring system was created to
account for participants (1 point if any justification
was given for the cohort and 1 point for appropriate
inclusion and exclusion criteria), outcome (1 point if
diagnosis of type 2 diabetes was confirmed according
to accepted clinical criteria23 24 and not based on self
report), intervention (1 point if participants’ usual
fruit and vegetable consumption was assessed with a

validated tool25), and statistical analysis (1 point was
given if adjustments were made for age, body mass
index (BMI) and family history of type 2 diabetes,
these being proven risk factors for type 2 diabetes).
Another point was given for any other adjustments,
such as physical activity.

The system was designed with reference to
MOOSE,26 QUATSO,27 and STROBE28 and allowed
a total score from 0 to 6 points, with 6 reflecting the
highest quality.

Data abstraction and synthesis
Two authors (PC and JT) independently extracted data
on the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes, intake of fruit and
vegetables, and the associated risk. Hazard ratios and
relative risks were used as a measure of the association.
We assumed relative risks to be a valid approximation
of hazard ratio,21 enabling the use of one consistent
measure. The studies used various measurements for
intake—for example, servings per week, grams per
day. We standardised all data into servings per day,
using a standard portion size of 106 g.29 Any disagree-
ment was resolved through discussion. When insuffi-
cient data were published we contacted authors.

Statistical methods
We transformed hazard ratios and relative risks by tak-
ing their natural logarithms and calculating standard
errors and corresponding confidence intervals.30
Hazard ratios and their standard errors were pooled
with a random effects model to account for statistical
heterogeneity between studies to calculate summary
hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals for the
highest versus lowest level of consumption.31 The
data were analysed with Stata (version 10). Heteroge-
neity was assessed with the I2 statistic. We carried out
subgroup analyses based on the quality of the study
(high quality (4-6) v lower quality (<4)), sex (men and
women included v women only), length of follow-up (<
10 years v ≥10 years), fractions of intake (comparison of
the different quantification of intake, either thirds,
quarters, or fifths), and location (United States and Eur-
ope v China) as these were thought to be possible
sources of heterogeneity. Significance was set at
P<0.05 and 95% confidence intervals are quoted
throughout.

RESULTS
The search identified 3446 articles (fig 1). We assessed
titles and abstracts and obtained full articles of poten-
tially relevant studies. Several articles examined fruit
and vegetable intake within a dietary pattern only or
were cross sectional in design and therefore could not
be included. In two cases papers reported data from the
same study so we excluded the older papers. 32 33 One
study did not give enough details on actual fruit and
vegetable intake to warrant inclusion within the meta-
analysis. 34 Another study was excluded as data were
presented as odds ratios, 35 and the combination of
odds ratios and relative risks can lead to misinterpreta-
tion of results. 21 We added data from that study in the
sensitivity analysis to see if it significantly altered the
observed associations.

Study characteristics
Six studies met all the inclusion criteria.36-41 Table 1
shows the study characteristics and main outcomes.
The combined population resulted in 223 512 study
participants; only two studies included men. 38 40 The

age of participants ranged from 30 to 74 years. Study
length ranged from 4.6 years to 23 years (median of 13.
4 years). Three papers provided information on fruit
and vegetable intake separately and combined. 37 39 41
Two papers provided information on fruit and vegeta-
ble intake separately, 36 38 and another paper provided
only the combined data. 40 Four papers also included
separate data on the
green leafy
vegetables. 36-39 In most papers intake of fruit and vege-
tables was divided into fifths, though the paper by Ford
and Mokdad analysed the data as thirds 40 and the
paper by Montonen and colleagues examined
quarters. 38

Study quality and publication bias
None of the papers met all of the criteria of the quality
assessment tool, with all papers missing out on a point
for justification of the cohort. Papers did not state that a
power calculation had been undertaken nor give any
justification for the numbers of participants needed to
detect an effect of differences in fruit and vegetable
intake and the incidence of type 2 diabetes. All papers

made some adjustments for potential confounding fac-
tors; only three, however, adjusted for age, BMI, and
family history of type 2 diabetes.37-39 Only two papers
used appropriate inclusion and exclusion criteria36 37
(we assumed that authors should have excluded
patients with a history of type 2 diabetes, cancer, or
cardiovascular disease and those with implausibly
high or low dietary intake). Two papers38 40 did not
use what we considered to be a validated tool to assess
fruit and vegetable intake.25

Publication bias was assessed by visually examining
a funnel plot of precision against hazard ratio (not
shown), with asymmetry being formally assessed with
the Egger test; no significant bias was shown (P=0.27).

Analysis of summary estimates
The summary estimates of hazard ratios or relative
risks from each publication were pooled to give a
total estimate of risk (table 2). We specifically looked
at lowest intake values versus highest intake values.
The meta-analysis did not show any significant reduc-
tions in risk of type 2 diabetes incidence for consump-
tion of
fruit, vegetables, or vegetables and fruit
combined (figs 2, 3, and 4), though the data do suggest
a trend towards a benefit of consuming greater quanti-
ties (table 2). All studies that examined intake of green
leafy vegetables showed a benefit of consuming greater
quantities (fig 5). Summary estimates showed that con-
suming 1.35 servings a day of green leafy vegetables
(highest intake) compared with 0.2 servings (lowest
intake) resulted in a 14% reduction in risk (P=0.01) of
type 2 diabetes (hazard ratio 0.86, 95% confidence
interval 0.77 to 0.96).

Because of the significant heterogeneity observed
between studies we carried out a sensitivity analysis
(table 3). We separately analysed quality of articles,
sex, length of follow-up, and location as these were
assumed to be potential sources of bias. We also inves-
tigated whether the different ways in which authors
had grouped intake (thirds, quarters, or fifths) affected
the results. There were no significant interactions
between any of these variables that would explain the
heterogeneity seen. In addition we re-ran the meta-
analysis to include the EPIC study, 35 which presented
data as odds ratios. Inclusion of this study did not alter
the associations previously observed.

DISCUSSION
Principal finding
Increasing the amount of green leafy vegetables in an
individual’s diet could help to reduce the risk of type 2

diabetes. An increase of 1.15 servings a day was asso-
ciated with a 14% decrease in incidence. The data did
not show any significant relations between the con-
sumption of fruits, vegetables, or fruit and vegetables
combined on the incidence of diabetes. As there was
significant heterogeneity between studies, however,
we carried out a sensitivity analysis. This showed no
significant interactions between the outcomes of vari-
ables examined, and thus could not identify differences
that occurred between the studies.

Exploration of heterogeneity
Within the sensitivity analysis we examined location as
a possible source of heterogeneity. As traditional Chi-
nese diets are high in fruit and vegetables,42 we would
expect that intake would be greater in China than the
US or Europe. Intake, however, was quite similar. This
might reflect a change from traditional foods of China
to a more westernised diet.

We also examined sex as a possible source of hetero-
geneity; again this did not show any significant inter-
action between variables. Only two of the studies
included men, both of which showed significant benefits
of increasing intake of fruit and vegetables. Our results
might have been different if the studies in our meta-ana-
lysis had included more men. Further studies in men are
required before firm conclusions can be made.

Although the sensitivity analysis could not explain
the level of heterogeneity, it could be because of sev-
eral differences between the studies. Estimations of
daily consumption differed between the studies. Ford
and Mokdad estimated servings per week,40 intake
from three studies was calculated as servings per
day,37 39 41 and the two remaining studies35 36 38 calcu-
lated grams per day. To carry out the meta-analysis
we had to standardise all data into servings per day,
therefore conclusions should be drawn with caution.

We standardised all data using a standard portion
size of 106 g, in agreement with other meta-analysis
studies that have analysed fruit and vegetable intake
and risk of chronic disease.20 29 The current UK recom-
mendation to consume five portions of fruit and vege-
tables a day, however, is based on 80 g as a serving size.
Therefore from our analysis we can calculate that
increasing consumption of green leafy vegetables by
one and a half UK portions a day (121.9g) could result
in 14% reduction in the incidence of type 2 diabetes.

In addition to calculating intake in different formats
the studies also grouped foods differently. Three studies
examined intake of fruit and vegetables separately and
combined,37 39 41 one
study examined combined
consumption,40

separately.36 38 These two papers both showed significant
benefits of greater consumption of fruit, vegetables, and
green leafy vegetables. They did not, however, explain
why they did not report combined data, and this could

RESEARCH

Heterogeneity could also be caused by differences in
classification of food groups. The studies that investi-
gated green leafy vegetables did not all use the same
criteria;
two papers included spinach, kale, and
lettuce,37 39 another included Chinese greens, greens,
and spinach,36 and the other paper did not provide a
definition.38 This shows a need for one uniform defini-
tion of different fruit and vegetable groups. Green leafy
vegetables actually include brassicas, such as cabbage,
brussel sprouts, and cauliflower; Compositae, such as
lettuce; and umbelliferous vegetables, which are plants
grown for their leaves and stems and are often con-
sumed as herbs, such as parsley, dill, and fennel.
Other leafy vegetables such as spinach are also
included.43 The investigators did not include all of
these foods in their categories of green leafy vegetable;
if they were included the observed results might differ.
Another possible explanation for the differences
between the studies might be the method of dietary
assessment. Ford and Mokdad collected data via a sin-
gle 24 hour recall,40 two studies used dietary assess-
ment interviews,36 38 and the remaining studies used
self completed food frequency questionnaires. Assess-
ment of true dietary intake is inherently difficult, and
the use of food frequency questionnaires has been
criticised.44 45 They are subject to a combination of ran-
dom and systematic errors.46 These errors

measurement can underestimate true interactions
between diet and disease.47 48 Such attenuation could
have masked an association in our meta-analysis.
Indeed studies have previously shown that interactions
between diet and disease have been masked by the use
of food frequency questionnaires but identified by food
diaries and nutritional biomarkers.49-51 The use of bio-
markers avoids problems associated with self report,
and they can be collected for large numbers of partici-
pants. Thus there is a need to incorporate more biolo-
gical markers of fruit and vegetable intake, such as
plasma vitamin C concentration,
into prospective
nutritional assessment studies.

In our meta-analysis we included the most fully
adjusted hazard ratio presented in the articles. Not all
authors of the primary articles made the same adjust-
ments, and this might have had an impact on our over-
all dataset. Indeed, only three of the six37-39 adjusted for
what we considered in our quality assessment tool as
essential confounders, (age, BMI, and family history of
type 2 diabetes).

Potential benefits of green leafy vegetables
Although our results for fruit and vegetable consump-
tion were not significant, the data do suggest a trend
towards a benefit of consuming greater quantities;
this supports evidence previously reported in cross sec-
tional studies.34 52 In addition several studies examin-
ing dietary patterns and incidence of type 2 diabetes
have consistently shown that fruit and vegetables are
important components of the dietary patterns asso-
ciated with a decreased risk of type 2 diabetes.53-55

A possible benefit of fruit and vegetables in the pre-
vention of chronic diseases is from their antioxidant
content and thus a contribution to reduction of sys-
temic oxidative stress. Our results support this as
green leafy vegetables, such as spinach, have been
shown to contain high concentrations of β carotene
and vitamin C,56 both of which confer antioxidant
properties. Green leafy vegetables also contain poly
phenols,57 which are known for their antioxidant prop-
erties. Green leafy vegetables might reduce the risk of
type 2 diabetes because of their magnesium content. A
recent meta-analysis found magnesium intake to be
inversely associated with incidence of
type 2
diabetes.58 Green leafy vegetables are also good
sources of α linolenic acid,59 which is an omega 3 poly-
unsaturated fatty acid. The fatty acid profile of the diet
is thought to be important in determining the fatty acid
composition of the phospholipid bilayer. The compo-
sition of this bilayer is related to insulin sensitivity
within skeletal muscle.60 Thus there are several possi-
ble mechanisms that could explain the benefit of con-
suming green leafy vegetables in the diet. Our results
support the evidence that “foods” rather than isolated
components such as antioxidants are beneficial for
health. Results from several supplement trials have
produced disappointing results for prevention of dis-
ease, in contrast with epidemiological evidence.61 62
Further investigation is warranted to understand the
mechanisms
involved in the proposed relation

Strengths and limitations
We carried out a broad search of both medical subject
headings and keywords that covered diabetes and fruit
and vegetable consumption. The search was con-
ducted on multiple databases and was carried out by
two independent authors. In addition we contacted all
authors of included articles to request any further infor-
mation.

As with all meta-analysis, several limitations must be
considered. Publication bias is a potential concern in
analyses of published studies. The statistical tests we
carried out, however, suggest that bias was not present.
The statistical power of the study might be limited as
we included only six studies and only four studies for
the examination of green leafy vegetables. In addition
the meta-analysis includes only one study from Eur-
ope, highlighting a lack of potentially important infor-
mation.

There was significant heterogeneity between the
included studies so overall conclusions must be
regarded with caution. We did, however, carry out a
thorough sensitivity analysis to investigate possible
sources of heterogeneity.

To further examine the association between intake
and risk of type 2 diabetes we investigated the possibi-
lity of carrying out a dose-response analysis. Only one
paper, however, provided the information required.36
In addition, four out of the six studies included were
given quality assessment scores of less than 4.38-41
When these studies were removed from the analysis
the results did not significantly alter, so conclusions
must be drawn with caution. Previous studies have
also shown that greater intake of fruit and vegetables
is linked to other lifestyle factors such as physical
activity.52 We cannot rule out the possibility that
other variables, which were not adequately controlled
for, might have influenced the data from these studies.
The results highlight a call for standardisation of nutri-
tional epidemiology, with emphasis on the additional
use of biological markers and uniformity of food
groups.

tions to promote the consumption of green leafy

sources and risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) remains unclear. We systematically searched
multiple literature databases through June 2011 to identify prospective studies examining relations
of dietary n-3 PUFA, dietary fish and/or seafood, and circulating n-3 PUFA biomarkers with
incidence of DM. Data were independently extracted in duplicate by 2 investigators, including
multivariate-adjusted relative risk (RR) estimates and corresponding 95% CIs. Generalized least-
squares trend estimation was used to assess dose-response relationships, with pooled summary
estimates calculated by both fixed-effect and random-effect models. From 288 identified abstracts,
16 studies met inclusion criteria, including 18 separate cohorts comprising 540,184 individuals
and 25,670 cases of incident DM. Consumption of fish and/or seafood was not significantly
associated with DM (n=13 studies; RR per 100g/d=1.12, 95% CI=0.94, 1.34); nor were
consumption of EPA+DHA (n=16 cohorts; RR per 250mg/d=1.04, 95% CI=0.97, 1.10) or
circulating levels of EPA+DHA biomarkers (n=5 cohorts; RR per 3% of total fatty acids=0.94,
95% CI=0.75, 1.17). Both dietary ALA (n=7 studies; RR per 0.5g/d=0.93, 95% CI=0.83, 1.04) and
circulating ALA biomarker levels (n=6 studies; RR per 0.1% of total fatty acid=0.90, 95%
CI=0.80, 1.00, P=0.06) were associated with non-significant trend towards lower risk of DM.
Substantial heterogeneity (I2~80%) was observed among studies of fish/seafood or EPA+DHA
and DM; moderate heterogeneity (<55%) was seen for dietary and biomarker ALA and DM. In
unadjusted meta-regressions, study location (Asia vs. North America/Europe), mean BMI, and
duration of follow-up each modified the association between fish/seafood and EPA+DHA
consumption and DM risk (P-Interaction ≤ 0.02 each). We had limited statistical power to
determine the independent effect of these sources of heterogeneity due to their high collinearity.
The overall pooled findings do not support either major harms or benefits of fish/seafood or EPA
+DHA on development of DM, and suggest that ALA may be associated with modestly lower risk.
Reasons for potential heterogeneity of effects, which could include true biologic heterogeneity,
publication bias, or chance, deserve further investigation.

Introduction

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) accounts for 90–95% of all diabetes cases and has reached
epidemic proportions globally, including in both developed and developing countries (1). As
a major risk factor for coronary heart disease, stroke, blindness, kidney failure, and
peripheral arterial disease, DM poses tremendous public health burdens. Epidemiological
and clinical trial evidence demonstrate that lifestyle including diet plays a major role in the
development of DM (2). Further understanding of the role of specific foods and nutrients in
the pathogenesis of DM is of paramount importance.

Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA) include eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA,
20:5n-3) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6n-3) from seafood, and alpha-linolenic acid
(ALA, 18:3n-3) from plant sources. Based on animal experimental studies, n-3 PUFA
improve several metabolic abnormalities underlying the development of DM. Such effects
include insulin-sensitizing effects via increased production and secretion of adipocytokines
such as adiponectin and leptin (3–6); and potential prevention of insulin resistance via anti-
inflammatory effects mediated directly (7) or through conversion to specialized pro-
resolution mediators such as resolvins and protectins (8; 9). Through modulation of
transcription factors (e.g. sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c), n-3 PUFA could
also enhance fatty acid oxidation and reduce de novo lipogenesis, effects which could
reduce hepatic fat accumulation and preserve hepatic insulin sensitivity (10–13).

Despite metabolic benefits in animal experiments, the impact of n-3 PUFA consumption on
risk of DM in humans remain uncertain. In meta-analyses of controlled supplementation
trials, n-3 PUFA supplementation does not produce major changes in biomarkers of glucose-
insulin homeostasis in subjects with DM (14–16); similar trials in healthy subjects have
reported conflicting findings (17). In addition to these short-term trials, which generally

tested high supplemental doses of n-3 PUFA, several long-term prospective studies have
assessed how habitual dietary consumption of n-3 PUFA or seafood, or circulating
biomarkers of consumption, relate to incidence of DM, but with mixed findings. Therefore,
whether n-3 PUFA influence risk of incident DM and, if so, the direction and magnitude of
effect remain unknown. To address these important scientific and public health questions,
we carried out a systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective studies that assessed the
relation of dietary n-3 PUFA, fish and/or seafood consumption, and biomarker levels of n-3
PUFA with the incidence of DM.

Methods
Search Strategy and Eligibility Criteria

We followed the Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guidelines for the
design, implementation, analysis and reporting of this study (18). We searched for all
prospective cohort studies, including nested prospective studies, that assessed the
association of dietary n-3 PUFA intake (ALA, EPA+DHA, or EPA and DHA individually),
dietary fish and/or seafood intake, and biomarkers of n-3 PUFA (ALA, EPA+DHA, or EPA
and DHA individually) with incidence of DM. Searches were performed electronically
through MEDLINE, EMBASE, Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature
(LILACS), related articles, hand-searching of references, and direct author contact. Key
words included (among others) omega-3, alpha-linolenic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid,
docosahexaenoic acid, fish oils, fishes, diabetes mellitus, cohort studies, prospective studies,
and nested case control; the full search terms are available on request. Searches included the
earliest available online indexing year through to June 30, 2011, with no language
restrictions.

Studies were eligible for inclusion if they were prospective cohort studies that provided a
multivariate-adjusted effect estimate (odds ratio, relative risk [RR], or hazard ratio) and
information about its variance for any of the exposures of interest and incident DM.
Exclusion criteria included studies of pregnant women or children (<19y), studies of type 1
diabetes, retrospective case-control studies, cross-sectional and ecological studies, literature
reviews, commentaries, editorials, letters, case reports, studies which investigated only
shellfish or selected subtypes of fish intake (e.g., fried fish), and studies which provided
only crude risk estimates. If multiple manuscripts were published from the same cohort, we
included the most up-to-date analyses that had accrued the highest number of DM cases.

Selection of Articles

The titles and abstracts of all identified articles were screened by one investigator (J.W.) for
eligibility. Two investigators (J.W., R.M.) assessed independently and in duplicate the full
texts of the remaining articles to reach a final decision on inclusion or exclusion, with
differences resolved by consensus. Of 288 initially identified articles, 262 were excluded
based on title and abstract (Figure 1). Of 26 full text articles, 10 were excluded because they
were duplicate publications from the same cohort (n=3)(19–21), assessed consumption of
restaurant fried fish intake but not overall fish intake (n=1)(22), lacked RR estimates for fish
or n-3 PUFA exposures (n=4)(23–26), or did not separately report results for DM vs. impaired
glucose tolerance (n=2).(27; 28) After final exclusions, 16 studies were identified for
inclusion in the meta-analysis (29–44).

Data Extraction

For each included study, data were extracted independently and in duplicate by two
investigators (J.W., R.M.) using a standardized electronic form, including information on
study design, study location (North America, Europe, or Asia/Australia), whether the

analysis was pre-specified or post hoc, subject inclusion and exclusion criteria, sample size,
subject age, body mass index (BMI), co-morbidities, gender, race, duration of follow-up
(mean, median or max number of years), number of events, methods for dietary assessment
and diagnosis of DM, laboratory procedure for fatty acid biomarkers (e.g. plasma
phospholipid measurements), covariates adjusted for, and multivariable-adjusted risk
estimates including data needed to calculate its variance (e.g., CI, SE, or P-value). For
studies reporting risk across categories of exposure, we further recorded for each study the
exposure-category-specific data on person-years of follow up, number of subjects, number
of DM cases, median value of exposures, and risk estimate including its variance. For
studies reporting on both fish and total seafood intake, we extracted both estimates. When
more than one multivariable model was assessed, we extracted risk estimates having the
greatest adjustment for potential confounders that did not also include potential
intermediates (blood glucose, triglyceride, or inflammatory biomarkers). Whereas no single
accepted criteria for grading quality of cohort exists, such grading can be useful for
exploring quality and heterogeneity. We assessed quality using previously reported methods
by considering 5 criteria: appropriateness and reporting of inclusion and exclusion criteria,
methods for assessment of exposure, methods for assessment of outcome, adjustment for
confounding, and evidence of bias (45).

Among the 16 studies included in the meta-analysis, we contacted and received responses
from authors of 11 studies for relevant missing information, such as baseline characteristics
(age, BMI, exposure distributions) or exposure category data (number of participants,
person-years of follow-up, number of cases, median level of exposure, or risk estimates and
95% CI).

Statistical Analysis

Because nearly all studies reported risk across exposure categories, risk estimates were
meta-analyzed using the 2-step generalized least-squares trend (GLST) model (46; 47). This
method utilizes all information from all exposure categories to estimate the log-linear dose-
response slope within each study, which are then pooled to derive an overall risk estimate.
For studies already reporting risk estimates for linear differences in exposure (e.g., per SD
change in biomarker levels(34)) rather than in categories, data were added to the GLST
model at the second stage. Because DM events were relatively rare in all studies, we
considered odds ratios and hazard ratios to approximate RRs. Necessary data for the first
step of GLST included, for each exposure category in each study, the multivariable-adjusted
risk estimate and its corresponding standard errors, person-years of follow-up (for
prospective cohort studies) or number of subjects (for nested case-cohort studies), median
level of exposure, and number of cases in each exposure category. When category-specific
median intakes were not reported, they were imputed based on the midpoint of intake in the
range in each category(42), or, for estimating category-specific EPA+DHA intake from fish
or seafood intakes (37; 39; 42), by using a conversion factor calculated from nationally
representative dietary surveys as part of our work in the Global Burden of Diseases
study (48). The I2 statistic was used to assess heterogeneity (49). Fixed effect models were
used to pool results with low I2 (<35%), whereas random effect models were used to pool
studies with moderate or higher I2 (≥35%). We conducted secondary meta-analyses without
GLST, by pooling the risk estimates comparing the highest to the lowest category in each
study.

Potential heterogeneity was explored by meta-regression to examine whether risk estimates
were significantly different according to several prespecified factors, each modeled
individually and then, if significant in univariate models, together with other significant
factors to determine independence. Potential sources of heterogeneity included age (< or ≥
median of all cohorts; continous), study location (Asia or North America/Europe), sex

up (< or ≥ median of all cohorts; continuous), study quality score (low, 0–3 or high, 4–5),
and whether the reported analysis was pre-specified or post hoc. Publication bias was
assessed by visual inspection of funnel plots as well as with Begg’s test (50). All analyses
were performed using STATA 10.0 (StataCorp, College Station, Tex), with 2-sided
alpha=0.05.

Results
Study populations

The 16 studies covered 4 continents, including 9 studies in the US, 5 in Europe, 3 in Asia,
and 1 in Australia (Table 1). In sum, 25,670 cases of incident DM were identified among
540,184 participants. The average participant was middle-aged, although ranges of ages
within each cohort were relatively broad. The average follow-up duration in each study
varied from 4.0 to 16.7 y among the 15 studies that reported this value. The majority of
studies (14 of 16) were judged to be of high quality (quality score 4 or 5). Among dietary
exposures, 13 cohorts provided risk estimates for fish and/or seafood, 12 cohorts for EPA
+DHA with 4 additional cohorts having data allowing imputation of EPA+DHA, and 7
cohorts for ALA. Among biomarker exposures, 5 cohorts provided risk estimates for EPA
alone, DHA alone, and EPA+DHA, and 6 cohorts for ALA. The ranges of dietary and
biomarker exposure distributions for each study were broad (Supplementary Tables 1–2).
All studies provided multivariable-adjusted risk estimates without adjustment for the
potential intermediates of blood glucose, triglycerides, or inflammatory biomarkers.

Fish/Seafood Consumption

Across 13 cohorts, consumption of fish and/or seafood was not significantly associated with
incidence of DM (per 100g/day, RR=1.12, 95% CI=0.94, 1.34, P=0.21, Figure 2).
Substantial between-study heterogeneity was evident (I2=82.9%). In stratified analyses and
unadjusted meta-regressions, study location (Asia vs. North America/Europe), mean BMI,
and duration of follow-up each significantly modified the association of fish/seafood intake
and risk of DM. Lower risk was seen in studies from Asia, in studies with lower mean BMI
(<24.5 kg/m2), and in studies with shorter durations of follow-up (<10y); and higher risk in
studies from North America/Europe, with higher mean BMI (≥24.5 kg/m2), and with longer
durations of follow-up (≥10y) (P-Interaction ≤ 0.007 each). For example, fish/seafood was
associated with lower DM risk in Asia cohorts (RR per 100g/d=0.89, 95% CI=0.81, 0.98),
and higher risk in North America/Europe cohorts (RR per 100g/d=1.38, 95% CI=1.13, 1.70)
(Figure 3).

Because study location, mean BMI, and duration of follow-up were highly collinear across
studies – the cohorts from Asia were generally the same as those with lower mean BMI and
shorter durations of follow-up (Figure 3) – none of these three factors remained statistically
predictive of heterogeneity in multivariable meta-regression including all three factors (P ≥
0.18 each). Even among studies restricted to North America/Europe, substantial unexplained
heterogeneity remained (I2=70.1%); no heterogeneity was evident across studies in Asia
(I2=0%).

When we repeated meta-analysis of risk estimates comparing the top to the bottom exposure
category in each study, similar results were seen, with no overall pooled association between
fish/seafood consumption and incidence of diabetes (RR=1.07, 95% CI=0.94, 1.22, P=0.29,
I2=77.7%). When evaluated separately, study location, mean BMI, and duration of follow-
up each again significantly modified the association between fish/seafood intake and risk of
DM (P-Interaction<0.05 each), with similar collinearity as above. Overall findings were also

similar when restricted to the 8 risk estimates for fish consumption alone or the 8 risk
estimates for seafood consumption alone (data not shown).

Dietary EPA and DHA

Across 16 cohorts, estimated EPA+DHA consumption was not associated with DM risk (per
250mg/day, RR=1.04, 95% CI = 0.97–1.10, P = 0.27, Figure 4). Substantial heterogeneity
was evident (I2=82%). Because these studies of estimated EPA+DHA consumption were
largely overlapping with the studies of fish consumption described above, in unadjusted
meta-regressions this heterogeneity again appeared partly related to varying study location,
mean BMI, and durations of follow-up (P-Interaction ≤ 0.02 each), with similar collinearity
among these factors as described previously. For example, in studies in Asia, EPA+DHA
consumption was associated with lower incidence of DM (per 250mg/day, RR=0.95, 95%
CI=0.91, 0.99), with minimal heterogeneity across studies (I2=14.7%); whereas in studies in
North America/Europe, EPA+DHA consumption was associated with higher incidence of
DM (per 250mg/day, RR=1.12, 95% CI=1.05, 1.20), with substantial remaining
heterogeneity (I2=67.5%) (Supplementary Figure 1).

Meta-analysis of risk estimates comparing the top vs. bottom exposure category in each
study gave similar results, with no overall pooled association between EPA+DHA
consumption and incidence of diabetes (RR=1.04, 95% CI=0.94, 1.16, P=0.46, I2=79.0%).
Among the 5 cohorts reporting risk estimates for estimated dietary EPA or DHA separately,
neither EPA (per 125mg/day, RR=1.07, 95% CI=0.85, 1.34, P=0.58) nor DHA (per 125mg/
day, RR=1.04, 95% CI=0.90, 1.21, P=0.59) were significantly associated with incidence of
DM, although substantial heterogeneity was present for both estimates (I2=77.4% and
80.2%, respectively).

Circulating EPA+DHA

Among 5 cohorts that evaluated circulating EPA+DHA biomarkers, no association was seen
between EPA+DHA concentrations and incidence of DM: per 3% of total fatty acids,
RR=0.94, 95% CI=0.75, 1.17, P=0.56 (Figure 5). Moderate heterogeneity was evident
(I2=40.4%). Meta-regression did not identify any statistically significant sources of
heterogeneity, although statistical power was limited due to only 5 studies. Four cohorts
were from North America/Europe, and one from Australia; none were from Asia. Excluding
the Australian cohort, EPA+DHA concentrations were not associated with higher incidence
of DM: per 3% of total fatty acids, RR=0.88, 95% CI=0.72, 1.08). Meta-analysis of risk
estimates for the top vs. bottom exposure category in each study gave similar results
(RR=0.94, 95% CI=0.82, 1.09, I2=47%). When circulating EPA and DHA were evaluated
separately, neither EPA (per 1% of total fatty acids, RR= 0.96, 95% CI=0.86, 1.07, P=0.48,
I2=0%) nor DHA (per 1% of total fatty acids, RR=1.00, 95% CI=0.91, 1.10, P=0.97, I2=0%)
were significantly associated with incidence of DM.

Across 7 cohort studies, estimated ALA consumption was associated with a non-significant
trend toward lower incidence of DM (per 0.5g/day, RR=0.93, 95% CI=0.83, 1.04, P=0.20,
Figure 6). Heterogeneity was present (I2=54.3%), but no statistically significant sources of
heterogeneity were identified by meta-regression, although power was limited. Similar
results were obtained in meta-analysis of risk estimates comparing the top to the bottom
exposure category in each study (RR=0.92, 95% CI=0.80, 1.05, P=0.21, I2=40.3%).

Circulating ALA

Page 7

In 6 cohorts that assessed circulating ALA biomarkers, higher ALA levels were associated
with a non-significant trend towards lower risk of DM (per 0.1% of total fatty acids,
RR=0.90, 95% CI=0.80, 1.00, P=0.06, Figure 7). Between-study heterogeneity was not
evident (I2 =17.9%). Results were similar in meta-analysis of risk estimates in the top vs.
bottom exposure category in each study (RR=0.87, 95% CI=0.74, 1.01, P=0.07, I2=18.9%).

Publication bias

For dietary fish/seafood intake, visual inspection of the funnel plot found that individual
study RR estimates were reasonably symmetrical about the pooled effect estimate,
suggesting no evidence of publication bias (Supplementary Figure 2, top panel). This was
supported by a null Begg’s test for publication bias (P = 0.45). For dietary EPA+DHA
intake, the funnel plot showed slightly more data points among the smaller studies to the left
of the pooled estimate of RR, indicating possible publication bias in favor of a protective
association (Supplementary Figure 2, bottom panel). Begg’s test (P = 0.59) suggested no
significant evidence of publication bias. There was also little evidence for publication bias
for all other exposure-outcome relationships based on either visual inspection of funnel plots
or Begg’s test (data not shown).

Discussion

The overall findings from this systematic review and meta-analysis suggest that dietary EPA
+DHA and fish/seafood consumption do not have either major harmful or beneficial
associations with the development of DM. However, we identified substantial heterogeneity
in findings across studies. Our findings also suggest that plant-derived ALA could be
protective, though this result was of borderline statistical significance.

Fish/seafood intake, n-3 PUFA, and DM risk

We found little evidence that fish or seafood, dietary EPA+DHA, or circulating EPA+DHA
biomarkers were associated with risk of DM overall. These studies typically comprised
moderately overweight but otherwise generally healthy participants at baseline. Prior short-
term randomized controlled trials have found very little effect of n-3 PUFA supplementation
on glucose metabolism or indices of insulin resistance in healthy subjects (5; 51–53).
Therefore, our overall findings are consistent with these prior metabolic trials and suggest
that, at typical dietary levels of consumption in generally healthy subjects, fish, seafood, or
dietary EPA+DHA may have minimal effects on development of DM.

Our results also demonstrate large heterogeneity between study results. Such heterogeneity
could be due to chance, or related to variations in population characteristics, geographical
locations, or study methodology. Studies included in the meta-analyses generally had high
quality score (≥4) and were pre-specified analyses, and these factors were not significant
sources of heterogeneity. Conversely, EPA+DHA and fish/seafood consumption were
associated with lower risk of DM in studies conducted in Asia, and higher risk of DM
among studies conducted in North America/Europe. Mean cohort BMI and duration of
follow-up were also potential sources of heterogeneity, but these study characteristics
tracked with study location and their independent effects could not be confirmed.

Reasons for heterogeneity of effects by region could include true biologic diversity,
publication bias, or chance. For example, average types of fish consumed or fish preparation
methods may be different in Asia vs. North America/Europe, with potentially greater fatty
fish and raw/steamed fish in the former, vs. white fish or deep fried fish in the latter, that
could influence risk of DM. Pathophysiologic pathways for DM risk could also differ, and

be differently influenced by n-3 fatty acids, in Asian vs. Caucasian populations; for
example, Asians suffer DM at much lower BMI, with reasons not yet fully
understood (54; 55). Given potential benefits of fish or EPA+DHA consumption on total
mortality,(56) greater survivorship could also be a partial explanation for higher risk of DM
in longer-term studies, but this seems less likely to us and should be evaluated by
assessment of competing mortality in future studies. All of these subgroup findings may also
be due to chance and also should be interpreted cautiously as all analyses of heterogeneity
were based on average study-level, rather than individual-level, characteristics. Additional
studies in diverse cultures and geographical regions, as well as studies assessing potential
interaction with BMI or individual-level duration of follow-up, should explore these issues.
Notably, studies that used objective biomarkers of EPA+DHA found no evidence for higher
diabetes risk, including cohorts from North America/Europe. This suggests that the observed
higher risk in stratified analyses including only North America/Europe studies that utilized
self-reported estimates of fish or EPA+DHA consumption could be partly related to the
dietary assessment method, rather than to biologic effects of EPA+DHA per se.

ALA and DM risk

Compared with seafood sources, we identified fewer prospective studies of ALA and
incident DM. We found that both estimated dietary consumption and circulating biomarkers
of ALA were associated with a modest, nonstatistically significant trend towards lower risk
of DM. These pooled estimates demonstrated relatively low heterogeneity between-studies,
suggesting more consistent findings among studies. In several animal models, dietary ALA
or flaxseed oil (a rich source of ALA) improved insulin sensitivity and glycemic
responses (57–59). Similarly, some (60; 61), but not other (53), short-term randomized clinical
trials found that ALA or flaxseed oil moderately improved fasting plasma glucose and
markers of insulin resistance in humans. Our current results add to these limited but
potentially important data that ALA may provide moderate protection against the
development of DM. Because plant sources of n-3 PUFA are potentially more widely
available on a global basis, our findings highlight the need for further clinical and
observational investigation of these effects.

Strength and limitations

Our analysis had several strengths. Multiple databases were systematically searched to
ensure identification of all relevant published studies, and we also obtained clarification and/
or additional data from several authors to minimize misclassification and potential for
publication bias. The prospective cohort design of the included studies reduces the
possibility of recall and selection bias. The large number of total incident DM cases
provided statistical power to detect clinically meaningful associations. We pooled all
available information from each study using GLST, which accounts for both categories of
exposure and dose-response, rather than simply pooling often incomparable single extreme
categories. We evaluated both dietary estimates and objective biomarkers of n-3 PUFA, and
consistent findings for each increased confidence in validity of our findings. Studies were
identified from wide geographical locations (North America, Europe, Asia, Australia) with
varied population characteristics (age, BMI, sex, exposure distributions), increasing
generalizability.

Potential limitations should be considered. Although most studies adjusted for major
sociodemographic, lifestyle, clinical, and other dietary risk factors, the possibility of residual
confounding by unmeasured or imprecisely measured factors remains a possibility,
particularly as both seafood and ALA consumption are often associated with healthier
lifestyles. Conversely, measurement error in exposures could have attenuated true effects
towards the null, causing underestimation of associations. The consistency of findings for

both dietary and biomarker exposures is reassuring, as self-reported dietary estimates and
n-3 PUFA biomarkers are subject to differing types of error and sources of confounding.
Most studies evaluated total fish and/or seafood consumption, and we were unable to
evaluate specific fish species or preparation methods which might influence effects on DM.
As in all meta-analyses, publication bias is possible. However, visual inspection of funnel
plots did not suggest publication bias was a substantial problem; our direct contact with
authors and experts minimized the possibility of missing unpublished studies; and the
overall null pooled findings are typically less subject to influence from publication bias than
significant positive or inverse relations.

Figure 2.
Relative risk of type 2 diabetes associated with fish and/or seafood consumption in 13
prospective cohorts including 481,489 participants and 20,830 cases of incident diabetes.
Within-study relative risks and 95% CI’s were quantified using generalized least squares
trend estimation, and study-specific results were pooled using random effect meta-analysis.
For 3 cohorts reporting effect estimates for both fish and seafood intake,(29; 43) effects
estimates for fish were used in the primary analysis; findings using seafood did not
appreciably alter results (not shown).

Figure 4.
Relative risk of type 2 diabetes associated with estimated dietary EPA+DHA in 16
prospective cohorts including 440,873 participants and 21,512 cases of incident diabetes.
Within-study relative risks and 95% CI’s were quantified using generalized least squares
trend estimation, and study-specific results were pooled using random effect meta-analysis.
Exclusion of 4 studies for which the EPA+DHA intake was imputed from dietary fish/
seafood (37; 39; 42), did not appreciably alter the results (per 250mg/day, RR=1.06, 95%
CI=0.99, 1.14, P=0.08).

Figure 5.
Relative risk of type 2 diabetes associated with EPA+DHA biomarker concentrations (as %
of total fatty acids) in 5 prospective cohorts including 10,382 individuals and 1,581 incident
diabetes cases. Within-study relative risks and 95% CI’s were quantified using generalized
least squares trend estimation, and study-specific results were pooled using random effect
meta-analysis. Pooling results using the alternative biomarker measurements (red blood cell
phospholipids) in Patel et al (38), did not appreciably alter the results (per 3% of total fatty
acids, RR = 0.96, 95% CI = 0.76–1.21). The study by Wang et al (44), was not included due
to insufficient information to allow extraction of effect estimates. However, EPA and DHA
were not associated with risk of diabetes (44), and inclusion of this study is unlikely to
appreciably alter the observed results.

Relative risk of type 2 diabetes associated with ALA biomarker (as % of total fatty acids) in

Within-study relative risks and 95% CI’s were quantified using generalized least squares

Pooling results using the alternative lipid compartment of biomarker measurements from
Wang et al.(44) and Patel et al.(38) did not appreciably alter the results (per 0.1% of total fatty
acids, RR = 0.93, 95% CI = 0.85–1.02, P = 0.11).

Adipocytokines in Prediabetes and Type 2 Diabetes 
Mellitus: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of 
Randomized Controlled Trials

Background: The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to determine the effects of omega-3 supplementation 
on adipocytokine levels in adult prediabetic and diabetic individuals.
Methods: We searched PubMed, Medline, EMBASE, Scopus, Web of Science, Google Scholar, Cochrane Trial Register, World 
Health Organization Clinical Trial Registry Platform, and Clinicaltrial.gov Registry from inception to August 1, 2017 for ran-
domized controlled trials. Pooled effects of interventions were assessed as mean difference using random effects model. We con-
ducted a sensitivity, publication bias and subgroup analysis.
Results: Fourteen studies individuals (n=685) were included in the meta-analysis. Omega-3 supplementation increased levels of 
adiponectin (0.48 µg/mL; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.27 to 0.68; P<0.00001, n=10 trials), but effects disappeared after sensi-
tivity analysis. Tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) levels were reduced (–1.71; 95% CI, –3.38 to –0.14; P=0.03, n=8 trials). Treat-
ment duration shorter than 12 weeks was associated with greater reduction than longer treatment duration. Levels of other adipo-
cytokines were not significantly affected. Publication bias could generally not be excluded.
Conclusion: Eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid supplementation may increase adiponectin and reduce TNF-α 
levels in this population group. However, due to overall study heterogeneity and potential publication bias, a cautious interpreta-
tion is needed.

INTRODUCTION

Global rates of diabetes mellitus have reached epidemic pro-
portions and are associated with an ever-growing health and 
socioeconomic burden. The World Health Organization 
(WHO) estimates that the number of diabetic individuals rose 
from 108 million in 1980 to 422 million in 2014, whereas low- 
and middle-income countries have experienced a particularly 
high increase in diabetes prevalence [1]. With this enormous

increase in global rates of diabetes also rises the economic cost, 
e.g., US data show that the total economic cost of diagnosed 
cases of diabetes amounted to USD 174 billion in 2007 and 
rose to 245 billion in 2012 [2]. A large part of the growing dia-
betes rates can be explained by the enormous increase in the 
global burden of obesity [3]. According to data from WHO, 
more than 1.9 billion adults were overweight in 2014; of these 
600 million were obese [4]. Diabetes is associated with a signif-
icantly increased risk for all-cause mortality [5]. From the

type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), which is characterized by 
pancreatic β-cell secretion deficiency, and type 2 diabetes mel-
litus (T2DM), which is preceded by prediabetes in most indi-
viduals [6], and is caused by a complex interplay between insu-
lin resistance and β-cell dysfunction [7].

Increased body adiposity leads to a greater risk of developing 
T2DM even with at normal body mass index (BMI) [8]. Dys-
function at the cellular level within the adipose tissue has been 
linked to insulin resistance and T2DM [9]. It is now well-es-
tablished that adipose tissue is a metabolically highly active or-
gan, secreting a plethora of molecules, with more than 600 
identified so far [10]. These biologically active molecules, col-
lectively known as adipocytokines, have been suggested to play 
a significant role in insulin resistance [11], β-cell dysfunction 
[12], as well as the occurrence of diabetes [13] and associated 
comorbidities [14,15].

Omega-3 fatty acids, a group of polyunsaturated fatty acids, 
have gained increasing popularity among general population 
and clinicians for their suggested positive modulatory effects 
on a variety of physiological function. Eicosapentaenoic acid 
(EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) represent the two 
major types of omega-3 fatty acids. EPA and DHA are mainly 
gained from seafood consumption, such as from fatty fish. 
These fatty acids are essential, as they cannot be produced by 
the human body, but have to be obtained by consuming ma-
rine food, such as fatty fish and fish oil. Supplementing ome-
ga-3 fatty acids was estimated to costs of 34.7 billion USD in 
2016 [16]. These supplements have been used in managing a 
variety of clinical conditions and are believed to have a pletho-
ra of health benefits [17].

Regarding the effects of omega-3 fatty acids on the risk of 
developing diabetes, studies have shown mixed results [18,19]. 
Positive effects have been reported in relation to diabetic com-
plications [20]. Omega-3 fatty acids have also been associated 
with favourable outcomes on adiponectin and leptin [21] and 
a range of inflammatory cytokines [22].

Given their ever-increasing popularity and the emerging ev-
idence suggesting positive modulatory effects on signalling 
molecules, including adypocytokines, it is of high relevance to 
investigate the influence of omega-3 fatty acid supplementa-
tion on adipocytokine plasma concentration in prediabetic 
and diabetic individuals.

METHODS

Literature search
PubMed, Medline, EMBASE, Scopus, Web of Science, Google 
Scholar, Cochrane Trial Register, WHO Clinical Trial Registry 
Platform, and Clinicaltrial.gov Registry were used to systemat-
ically search for randomized controlled trials. We did not use 
any language restriction in the search. The literature was 
searched from inception to August 1, 2017. Key words includ-
ed, among others: fatty acids, omega-3, fish oil, EPA, DHA, ad-
ipokines, adipocytokines, leptin, adiponectin, and clinical trial. 
In addition, related articles in electronic databases were also 
searched. Retrieved articles, systematic reviews and meta-
analyses were searched manually in order to identify any over-
looked additional potentially relevant trials.

Study selection
We used the following inclusion criteria: (1) intervention in-
volving supplementation with EPA, DHA, both EPA and 
DHA, and fish oil; (2) randomized controlled trials with paral-
lel or cross-over design; (3) involving adult (≥18 years) human 
subjects diagnosed with any of the following clinical condi-
tions: insulin resistance, impaired glucose tolerance, impaired 
fasting glucose, or T2DM; (4) a minimum of 4 weeks interven-
tion period; (5) encompassed the evaluation the outcome of 
interest to this meta-analysis; and (6) reported post-interven-
tion mean values or change from baseline values with standard 
deviation (SD).

We applied the following exclusion criteria: (1) non-inter-
ventional studies, (2) uncontrolled studies, (3) lack of sufficient 
information on baseline or follow-up plasma concentration 
values of the selected adipocytokines, and (4) reviews, confer-
ence abstracts, commentaries, case reports, or duplicate publi-
cation from the same study.

Risk of bias assessment
We used Cochrane Collaboration’s tool for assessing the risk of 
bias in randomized trials in order to assess the risk of bias of 
included studies (low, unclear, high) with respect to following 
study characteristics: random sequence generation (selection 
bias), allocation concealment (selection bias), blinding of par-
ticipants and personnel (performance bias), blinding of out-
come assessment (detection bias), incomplete outcome data 
(attrition bias), selective reporting (reporting bias), and others 
[23].

Data extraction and statistical analysis
From every study included, the two authors independently ex-
tracted the following information into a data spread sheet: 
family name of the first author of the study; publication year; 
characteristics of trial participants (number, age and gender); 
duration of the intervention; definition of the intervention and 
respective control; and assessed outcomes.

We extracted values of group means and corresponding SD. 
Where medians or interquartile ranges were reported instead 
of means, we used formulas proposed by Hozo et al. [24] to 
calculate the means and SD values. Where standard error of 
the mean (SEM) was only reported, SD was estimated using 
the following formula: SD=SEM×square root (n), where n is 
the number of subjects. The primary end point was change in 
circulating levels of adipocytokines, which were reported as 
changes between the values of arithmetic means at the end of 
the study-baseline [25]. SD of mean differences (MDs) were 
calculated as SD=square root [(SDbaseline)2+(SDend of treatment)2–
(2r×SDbaseline×SDend of treatment)] for each group, assuming that 
r=0.5 [26]. 

We used the software Review Manager 5.3 as provided by 
the Cochrane Collaboration [27]. We applied the inverse-vari-
ance, random effects model of DerSimonian and Laird [28] to 
calculate the pooled estimates of the weighted MDs between 
the intervention and control groups, because this model incor-
porates between-study variability and provides a more conser-
vative estimate of the average effect size. 

The standard chi-square test was used as a statistical measure 
of heterogeneity between the different studies. The I2 value was 
applied to determine the magnitude of inconsistency [29], cal-
culated as I2=[(Q−df)]/Q×100%, Q being the χ2 value and df 
the corresponding degree of freedom. An I2 value of greater 
than 50.0 % was defined as a cut-off to determine considerable 
heterogeneity between the included studies.

Sensitivity analysis through the leave-one-out method was 
employed to explore whether the dependency of the results on 
individual studies when these reported substantially different 
effect-sizes than the other studies.

We used the funnel-plot method to test for publication bias. 
In this method, the difference in mean changes were plotted 
against their standard errors to measure the precision of the 
studies. Where there was any disagreement between the au-
thors, the data were revisited and agreed on by discussion by 
the authors.

RESULTS

Literature search and study characteristics
After applying all the selection criteria, 15 studies were includ-
ed in the systematic review [30-44]. These studies reported the 
following outcomes: plasminogen-activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-
1), adiponectin, leptin, resistin, tumor necrosis factor α 
(TNF-α), and interleukin 6 (IL-6). One study [42] had a cross-
over design, and could not be included in the quantitative syn-
thesis (meta-analysis) in Review Manager; hence, 14 studies 
with parallel design were included in the meta-analysis [30-
41,43,44]. Fig. 1 shows a detailed overview of the search strate-
gy. Fig. 2A represents the overall risk of bias summary accord-
ing to the defined characteristics, and Fig. 2B provides an 
overview across all individual studies included in the system-
atic review.

The studies included in the meta-analysis included a total of 
29 treatment arms, comprising a total of 685 trial participants

Fig. 2. Risk of bias assessment tool. (A) Summary of risk of 
bias of across the trials included in the systematic review. In-
formation for every study characteristic was pooled from every 
trial (green: low risk of bias; yellow: unclear risk of bias; red: 
high risk of bias), combined and overall results expressed in 
percentages. (B) Overview of risk of bias across individual tri-
als according to study characteristics. Each bias domain was 
evaluated carefully from every trial and decided whether the 
information provided reflected a low risk of bias (green), high 
risk of bias (red), or if insufficient information was provided 
and the risk of bias was therefore unclear (yellow).

(Table 1). Most studies involved subjects with T2DM; Krebs et 
al. [33], Spencer et al. [41], and Wong et al. [44] enrolled pa-
tients with prediabetes. One study [33] was conducted only 
with female subjects, otherwise both sexes were represented. 
The trial duration ranged from 6 to 24 weeks. Interventions in 
most studies consisted of omega-3 supplementation alone, in 
two studies [33,44] intended weight loss was a part of the in-
tervention. Most studies used both EPA and DHA in the inter-

vention, one study [30] used only EPA, and in one study EPA 
and DHA [38] were two different treatment arms, so that effect 
sizes were pooled separately. 

Influence of omega-3 supplementation on plasma 
concentrations of adipocytokines
Two studies reported PAI-1 levels. Kabir et al. [32] used IU/mL 
as unit, and conversion was done to ng/mL [45]. Omega-3

Fig. 7. Influence of omega-3 fatty acids supplementation on interleukin 6 levels (pg/mL). Forest plot shows pooled mean differences 
with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for eight intervention effects pooled from seven randomized controlled trials (two separate ef-
fects were pooled for docosahexaenoic acid [DHA] and eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA] treatment arms from Mori et al. [38]). The green 
colored square represents the point estimate of the effect of the intervention for each intervention. The horizontal line joins the upper 
and lower limits of the 95% CI of the effects. The square area represents the relative weight of the interventions in the meta-analysis. 
SD, standard deviation; IV, interval variable. 

leptin levels (MD, –0.03 ng/mL; 95% CI, –0.10 to 0.04; P=0.37, 
I2=0%) (Fig. 6A). As the effect reported in Spencer et al. [41] 
was considerably different compared with that of other indi-
vidual studies, we eliminated it from the analysis, this did re-
sult in a significant change in effect size (MD, –0.08 ng/mL; 
95% CI, –0.49 to 0.34; P=0.72, I2=11%) (Fig. 6B). 

Omega-3 supplementation also exerted an effect on plasma 
concentrations of inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF-α. 
The effects on IL-6 did not reach statistical significance (MD, 
–0.10 pg/mL; 95% CI, –0.25 to 0.05; P=0.2, I2=21%) (Fig. 7), 
but TNF-α levels significantly reduced (MD, –1.71; 95% CI, 
–3.38 to –0.14; P=0.03, I2=86%) (Fig. 8A), this effect also re-
mained after removing Spencer et al. [41] for the sensitivity 
analysis, as this was the only study which reported an increase 
in TNF-α levels in the primary analysis (MD, –2.01 pg/mL; 
95% CI, –3.55 to –0.47; P=0.01, I2=87%) (Fig. 8B).

Subgroup-analysis
As adiponectin and TNF-α were the only two outcomes whose 
blood levels were significantly affected by omega-3 supple-
mentation in the primary analysis and we found considerable 
study heterogeneity, we conducted a subgroup analysis by dose 
(low  ≤2,000 mg, high  >2,000 mg) and treatment duration 
(<12, ≥12 weeks) to investigate whether the effect of the inter-
vention in these outcomes varied between the subgroups.

For adiponectin, omega-3 significantly increased its levels 
when supplemented in high dose (MD, 0.62 µg/mL; 95% CI, 
0.40 to 0.85; P<0.00001, I2=99%); low-dose supplementation 

did not lead to significant changes (MD, 0.48 µg/mL; 95% CI, 
–0.73 to 1.69; P=0.44, I2=67%; test for subgroup differences: 
P=0.82, I2=0%) (Fig. 9A). As for treatment duration, we found 
significant effects in the subgroup ≥12 weeks (MD, 0.47 µg/mL; 
95% CI, 0.26 to 0.68; P<0.00001, I2=99%), while shorter treat-
ment duration did not produce statistically significant effects 
(MD, 0.73 µg/mL; 95% CI, –0.28 to 1.73; P=0.16, I2=0%; test 
for subgroup differences: P=0.62, I2=0%) (Fig. 9B). 

For TNF-α, omega-3 did not significantly change the levels 
neither in the low-dose (MD, –0.04 pg/mL; 95% CI, –0.10 to 
0.02; P=0.17, I2=0%) nor in the high-dose group (MD, –2.31 
pg/mL; 95% CI, –5.55 to 0.93; P=0.16, I2=88%; test for sub-
group differences: P=0.17, I2=46.9%) (Fig. 10A). Supplement-
ing omega-3 for less than 12 weeks significantly reduced 
TNF-α levels (MD, –4.71 pg/mL; 95% CI, –6.01 to –3.41;

were found with longer supplementation (MD, –0.16 pg/mL;

Publication bias
Visual inspection of funnel plots for adiponectin, leptin, IL-6, 
and TNF-α (Fig. 11) revealed a moderate asymmetry in all of 
the outcomes, so that a publication bias cannot be excluded 
and we cannot ascertain that a non-publication of negative or 
inconclusive data did not influence our meta-analysis.

Fig. 8. Influence of omega-3 fatty acids supplementation on tumor necrosis factor α levels (pg/mL). (A) Forest plot shows pooled 
mean differences with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for nine intervention effects pooled from eight randomized controlled trials 
(two separate effects were pooled for docosahexaenoic acid [DHA] and eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA] treatment arms from Mori et al. 
[38]). The green colored square represents the point estimate of the effect of the intervention for each intervention. The horizontal line 
joins the upper and lower limits of the 95% CI of the effects. The square area represents the relative weight of the interventions in the 
meta-analysis. (B) Meta-analysis after eliminating Spencer et al. [41] as part of the leave-one-out sensitivity analysis (the trial was giv-
en a relative weight of 0.0%). SD, standard deviation; IV, interval variable. 

DISCUSSION

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis to 
investigate the results of omega-3 supplementation on adipocy-
tokine levels in prediabetic and diabetic individuals. We found 
that omega-3 supplementation has no statistically significant 
effects on levels of PAI-1, resistin, leptin, and IL-6. We found 
that omega-3 can significantly increase adiponectin levels, but 
study heterogeneity was very high in this analysis (I2=98%). 
Moreover, this effect was dependent on one individual study, as 
it completely disappeared once we conducted sensitivity analy-
sis. Regarding TNF-α, omega-3 supplementation reduced its 
levels both in the primary as well in the sensitivity analysis, but 
with considerable study heterogeneity in both analyses. We 
conducted a subgroup analysis based on omega-3 dose and 

treatment duration for these two outcomes in order to elucidate 
whether the effects of omega-3 supplementation in the primary 
outcomes varied between the subgroups via a test of interaction 
(indicating effect modification). We found that for TNF-α, 
omega-3 supplementation has different effects in subgroups 
with different treatment durations while using 12 weeks as the 
cut-off value, i.e., there was significant effect modification 
based on treatment duration. Interestingly, lower treatment du-
ration significantly reduced TNF-α levels as compared to lon-
ger treatment duration. We found no effect modification in the 
dose subgroup analysis for TNF-α levels, nor for dose or treat-
ment duration for adiponectin levels. 

PAI-1’s associations with obesity and diabetes have been es-
tablished in the 1980s [46], and it is nowadays well established 
that elevated levels of PAI-1 are associated with the develop-

Leptin could be righteously called the master hormone of all 

adipokines, because of the variety of physiological functions 
that it controls and they are all of great relevance in diabetes 
[50]. Body fat mass is the single most important determinant 
of leptin levels in individuals, but insulin resistance that occurs

in T2DM was found to be associated with higher leptin levels 
independently of body fat mass [51]. Hyperleptinaemia is a 
marker of leptin resistance, a pathophysiological condition 
where tissues do not respond to leptin signaling, which further 
potentiates the metabolic and cardiovascular disarrangements 

that occur in face of diabetes [52]. Consequently, reducing 
blood leptin levels is suggested to ameliorate leptin sensitivity 
[53], but a recently conducted meta-analysis, which was not 
only constrained to prediabetic and diabetic individuals, found 
that moderate, but significant reduction in leptin levels was

achieved with omega-3 fatty acid supplementation in non-
obese individuals, whereas smaller and non-significant effects 
were observed in obese individuals [54], but the grade of re-
duction was greater than the one revealed in our analysis in 
both groups. 

Adiponectin circulates in relatively high concentrations (μg/mL) 
as compared to other adipokines, and has unique physiological 
properties with a profound impact on glucose and fatty acid 
metabolism as well as the cardiovascular system, which has 
placed it in the center of interest of the scientific community. 
Hypoadiponectinaemia paradoxically occurs in obesity and 
diabetes, and due to its insulin-sensitizing and anti-inflamma-
tory properties, increasing circulating levels of adiponectin is 
believed to result to improved metabolic and cardiovascular 
functions [55]. Our results are in line with those previously re-
ported in meta-analysis [56] and narrative reviews [21]. Inter-
estingly, the increase in adiponectin levels we observed was 
largely dependent on one study and there was unexplained 
study heterogeneity, as we could not infer effect modification 

neither to treatment duration nor omega-3 dose used. The un-
explained heterogeneity in adiponectin levels was also found 
in previous meta-analysis [56].

Resistin is a relatively newly discovered adipocytokine which 
is suggested to exert very important effects that link obesity to 
insulin resistance and T2DM [57], and evidence also amounts 
with regards to its role in mechanisms leading to cardiovascu-
lar disease, including inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, 
thrombosis, angiogenesis, and smooth muscle function. Re-
ducing the levels of resistin is therefore seen as a promising 
strategy [58]. To our knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis 
that investigated the effects of omega-3 supplementation on 
resistin, and even though the effect was non-significant with a 
very high degree of study heterogeneity, our results suggest a 
potential modulatory role of omega-3 fatty acids on this inter-
esting adipocytokine.

TNF-α and IL-6 are one of the main proinflammatory cyto-
kines that are also secreted to a large part from the adipose tis-
sue which is infiltrated by macrophages and other immune

cells and their levels are elevated in diabetic individuals, result-
ing to inflammation [59]. Inflammation not only contributes 
to the etiology of diabetes, but once the disease has set on, it 
aggravates its clinical course and is associated with a range of 
complications [60]. The reducing effects of omega-3 fatty acids 
on these two cytokines might be explained by their general an-
ti-inflammatory properties [23]. The reduction in subclinical 
inflammation by supplementing EPA and DHA along with po-
tential positive modulation of other physiological pathways 
that are brought about by changes in plasma concentrations of 
herein investigates cytokines may contribute to improved 
management of patients suffering from prediabetes or T2DM. 
Interestingly, our work identified that for TNF-α, treatment 
duration infers effect modification, where shorter treatment 
duration is associated with higher reductions in TNF-α levels.
However, our systematic review and meta-analysis has sev-
eral limitations. In general, most studies which were included 
did not provide sufficient information to be able to assess the 
risk of bias across many of the pre-set out criteria. Based on the 
I2 measure of greater than 50%, substantial study heterogeneity 
was found across outcome parameters investigated. The popu-
lation analyzed was also heterogeneous, as the patients en-
rolled differed in terms of general characteristics, such as age, 
BMI, male/female ratio, medication use. Omega-3 supplemen-
tation also varied across the included studies with regards to 
the dose, duration, and EPA/DHA ratio. Moreover, intentional 
weight loss was a part of intervention in two studies, whereas 
the remaining studies only included omega-3 supplementation 
as intervention. This is important, as weight loss is known to 
affect a variety of metabolic parameters. Furthermore, two 
outcome parameters (PAI-1 and resistin) were inspected on 
the basis of only two studies with a small sample size. Finally, 
we could not exclude publication bias in our meta-analysis. 
These limitations implicate that a cautious interpretation of the 
results of the present systematic review and meta-analysis is 
necessary.

Compelling evidence linking sugary drinks with
diabetes

It’s not just about obesity any more

Edward W Gregg chief, Epidemiology and Statistics Branch, Ann Albright director
Division of Diabetes Translation, National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,
Atlanta, GA, USA

Global estimates of diabetes prevalence continue to outpace
previous projections, as virtually all regions of the world
continue to see a large and growing prevalence.1 Proposals by
diabetes prevention experts for how to change these trends have
included both structured programmes for adults at high risk for
type 2 diabetes (the “high risk approach”) and environmental
and food policies to help change risk factors in the whole
population (the “population approach”).1 Promising programmes
for those at high risk are already underway and need to be
expanded,2 but complementary shifts in underlying risk factors
in the broader population are also needed. The list of risk factors
for type 2 diabetes is long, with dozens of demographic,
behavioural, and genetic risk factors now identified.3
Unfortunately the list of simple, consensus based levers to
change population risk factors and substantially influence the
risk for type 2 diabetes remains short.
In a linked paper (doi:10.1136/bmj.h3576) Imamura and
colleagues present a compelling case that beverages sweetened
with sugar should be a major target for policies aimed at
reducing the risk of diabetes.4 A systematic review of 17
prospective studies reported three findings; a higher intake of
sugar sweetened beverages was associated with an increased
incidence of type 2 diabetes, associations with juice consumption
were weaker and less consistent, and the link between artificially
sweetened beverages and diabetes incidence was largely
explained by obesity, perhaps indicating that the association
with risk of type 2 diabetes is due to obese people preferentially
choosing artificially sweetened beverages.4
Each extra 250 mL serving (currently consumed by more than
one third of the US population5) of sugar sweetened beverages,
or soft drinks each day, was associated with an 18% increased
risk of new diabetes. Important minority segments of the
population—notably children and young adults—have even
higher exposures and higher risks. Imamura and colleagues also
found that the association between intake of sugar sweetened
drinks and diabetes seems to be independent of obesity and thus
can compound the effects on obesity, consistent with previous
findings that sugar sweetened drinks have direct effects on
glycaemia and insulin resistance. Furthermore, the finding that

9-12% of new cases of type 2 diabetes in the United States (and
20% of cases among those aged 20-44) are potentially
attributable to sugar sweetened drinks, may be even more
important for people in countries such as Mexico, selected parts
of the Caribbean, Latin America, and South East Asia, where
consumption has been shown to be much higher.4 6
Some risk factors do their damage in an epidemic by
substantially increasing risk for the minority of people who have
that risk factor (for example, smoking for cancer and
cardiovascular disease; severe obesity for type 2 diabetes).7 8
Such factors lend themselves to targeted interventions confined
to high risk populations; but other risk factors do their damage
by increasing risk a modest amount in large numbers of people.
These latter types can lend themselves to policy approaches that
can efficiently change risk factors among large segments of the
population. Conditions are ideal for a population targeted policy
when a full cascade of clear evidence is in place: a causal
relation between risk factor and health; ability to change health
by reversing the risk factor; availability of low risk, low cost
interventions to alter the risk factor; and a strong policy lever
to implement the intervention efficiently.
Some, but not all, of this evidence cascade exists for sugar
sweetened drinks. They singularly account for a large proportion
of dietary added sugar and permit focused interventions.9
Modelling studies that incorporate additional downstream effects
on obesity, diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and
cancers suggest that reducing consumption could have
substantial effects on morbidity and mortality.6
It is, however, one thing to establish an association (which may
be causal) between sugared drinks and incident diabetes in
cohort studies and yet another to show that reducing
consumption improves population health. Trials of interventions
to lower consumption have shown reductions in body weight,
but we are not aware of any studies with diabetes as an
outcome.10 11 Furthermore, the policy levers that have been
proposed by experts in obesity prevention and
management—taxation or other pricing strategies, better product
labeling, selected limits on sales and advertising, improved

access to water and other lower calorie options12—have not been
evaluated for their effects on diabetes prevention.13
Nevertheless, high consumption of sugary drinks—two to four
times higher than it was in the 1980s—combined with clear
associations between intake and risk of chronic diseases, leaves
little room for doubt that action is warranted.5 6 The most
compelling reason to gradually decrease intake of sugary
drinks—to prevent obesity and diabetes in the first place—is
difficult to test in traditional trials. The pressing questions to
track are whether policies to reduce the intake of sugar
sweetened beverages can make any dent in the diabetes problem,
whether reducing sugary beverages is replaced by other
substances that negate benefits, and what specific approaches
will reduce consumption while lowering risk factors and
improving health.
Action is already underway in the areas of relative pricing and
reducing access in diverse international settings,14 15 and some
evidence suggests that in the US the intake of sugar sweetened
beverages, obesity, and diabetes prevalence have decreased,
although the reasons for such progress remain unclear.16 17 Active
policy development in the face of serious public health need
would benefit from the design of rigorous natural experiments
to quantify the magnitude of real health effects, compare
different policy approaches, and monitor populations for
compensatory changes in behaviour and unintended
consequences.18 Most importantly, evidence from natural
experiments in countries that adopt policies early could help
others learn from their mistakes and refine their successes.

Diabetes mellitus and CVD are some of the leading causes of mortality and morbidity. Accumulating data indicate that a diet characterised
by low-glycaemic index (GI) foods may improve the management of diabetes or lipid proﬁles. The objective of the present meta-analysis
was to critically analyse the scientiﬁc evidence that low-GI diets have beneﬁcial effects on carbohydrate and lipid metabolism compared
with high-GI diets. We searched for randomised controlled trials with a crossover or parallel design published in English between 1981 and
2003, investigating the effect of low-GI v. high-GI diets on markers for carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. Unstandardised differences in
mean values were examined using the random effects model. The main outcomes were fructosamine, glycated Hb (HbA1c), HDL-choles-
terol, LDL-cholesterol, total cholesterol and triacylglycerol. Literature searches identiﬁed sixteen studies that met the strict inclusion cri-
teria. Low-GI diets signiﬁcantly reduced fructosamine by 2 0·1 (95 % CI 2 0·20, 0·00) mmol/l (P¼ 0·05), HbA1c by 0·27 (95 % CI 2 0·5,
2 0·03) % (P¼ 0·03), total cholesterol by 2 0·33 (95 % CI 2 0·47, 2 0·18) mmol/l (P, 0·0001) and tended to reduce LDL-cholesterol in
type 2 diabetic subjects by 2 0·15 (95 % CI 2 0·31, 2 0·00) mmol/l (P¼ 0·06) compared with high-GI diets. No changes were observed in
HDL-cholesterol and triacylglycerol concentrations. No substantial heterogeneity was detected, suggesting that the effects of low-GI diets
in these studies were uniform. Results of the present meta-analysis support the use of the GI as a scientiﬁcally based tool to enable selec-
tion of carbohydrate-containing foods to reduce total cholesterol and to improve overall metabolic control of diabetes.

form of

Until recently carbohydrates in foods have been classiﬁed
as ‘simple’ and ‘complex’, based on the degree of poly-
merisation of the carbohydrate. However, the effects of
carbohydrate on health may be better described on the
basis of their physiological effects (e.g.
the ability to
raise blood glucose levels), which depend on the type of
constituent sugars (glucose, fructose and galactose), the
physical
the carbohydrate (particle size and
degree of hydration), nature of the starch (amylose, amylo-
pectin) and other food components (dietary ﬁbre, fat,
organic acids) (Augustin et al. 2002). This classiﬁcation
is referred to as the glycaemic index (GI) of a food and
was introduced by Jenkins et al. (1981) as a quantitative
assessment of foods based on postprandial blood glucose
response (Jenkins et al. 1981, 1984), expressed as a
percentage of the response to an equivalent carbohydrate
portion of a reference food, such as white bread or glucose
(Wolever et al. 1991).

A high-GI food with an equivalent carbohydrate content
as a low-GI food induces a larger area under the glucose
curve over the postprandial period. As a consequence of
the induced insulin response, intake of a high-GI food
may result
in lower blood glucose concentrations over
the late (2 – 3 h) postprandial period than that of a low-GI
food (Brand-Miller et al. 2001). Reducing the rate of
carbohydrate absorption by lowering the GI of the diet
may have several health beneﬁts, such as a reduced insulin
demand,
improved blood glucose control and reduced
blood lipid concentrations (Augustin et al. 2002). These
are all factors that play important roles in preventing the
onset of CVD and diabetes mellitus (DM).

Despite advances in the prevention and treatment in the
second half of the 20th century (Liu, 2002), CVD and DM
are still some of the leading causes of mortality and mor-
bidity. CVD is a multi-factorial disease, but its prevalence
can also be attributed to a diet high in fat and low in ﬁbre,

with inadequate micronutrient intakes (Vorster et al. 1997).
Worldwide,
the number of people with type 2 DM is
expected to rise from 135 million in 1995 to 300 million
in 2025 (King et al. 1998). Insulin resistance and progress-
ive pancreatic b-cell dysfunction are well-established fun-
damental steps in the pathogenesis of type 2 DM (Defronzo
et al. 1992; Kahn 1994). Accumulating metabolic and epi-
demiological data also indicate that impaired insulin action
and compensatory hyperinsulinaemia often result in abnor-
mal blood lipid patterns (elevations of triacylglycerol (TG)
and low concentrations of HDL-cholesterol, as well as
hypertension, which in turn increase the risk for CHD
(Liu, 2002)).

CVD and type 2 DM are common consequences of chan-
ging
and
increased energy density of diets). The conditions men-
tioned earlier are preventable through lifestyle modiﬁ-
cations (Seidell, 2000). But where does the GI ﬁt
in?
According to Brand-Miller et al. (2002), standard dietary
advice to reduce fat intake while increasing carbohydrate
intake generally increases the glycaemic effect of the
diet. The type and amount of carbohydrate consumed inﬂu-
ences postprandial glucose levels, and the interaction
between the two may be synergistic. A diet high in reﬁned
carbohydrates and high-GI foods, such as white bread and
potatoes, is rapidly digested and absorbed and results in a
high glycaemic load and increased demand for insulin
secretion (Holt et al. 1997). When insulin resistance is
prevalent and high-GI foods are consumed, postprandial
hyperglycaemia and insulinaemia are magniﬁed (Salmeron
et al. 1997a,b). On the other hand, low-GI, high-carbo-
hydrate foods may maintain insulin sensitivity and increase
the weight-loss potential of ad libitum low-fat diets
(Ludwig, 2002). Low-GI foods may also beneﬁt weight
control by promoting satiety and by promoting fat oxi-
dation at the expense of carbohydrate oxidation. These
qualities of low-GI foods can be attributed to the slower
rates at which they are digested and absorbed and the cor-
responding effects on postprandial glycaemia and hyperin-
sulinaemia (Brand-Miller et al. 2002).

However, there is no consensus on the importance of the
GI to human health and nutrition (Ludwig & Eckel, 2002).
Many clinicians and researchers, especially in the USA,
have questioned the relevance and practicality of the GI
(Coulston & Reaven, 1997). Presently, neither the Ameri-
can Diabetes Association (2001),
the American Heart
Association (Krauss et al. 2000), nor the American Dietetic
Association (1999) recognise a role for GI in disease pre-
vention or treatment. In contrast, the Joint Food and Agri-
culture Organization/World Health Organization Expert
Consultation on Carbohydrates (Food and Agriculture
Organization/World Health Organization, 1997), the Euro-
pean Association for the Study of Diabetes (Diabetes and
Nutrition Study Group (DNSG) of the European Associ-
ation for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) 2000), the Cana-
dian Diabetes Association (2000), Diabetes UK (2003)
and the Dietitians Association of Australia (1997) encou-
rage the application of the GI when choosing carbo-
hydrate-containing foods.

This has led to a constructive debate internationally
within the academic ﬁeld, industry, health practitioners

and regulatory authorities. It seems, therefore, imperative
that a meta-analysis on the long-term physiological effects
and health beneﬁts of using the GI to construct diets should
be done. A meta-analysis is the structured result of a litera-
ture review in which results from several independent but
related or comparable studies are systematically and stat-
istically combined or
to increase
power and precision (Vorster et al. 2003). We report the
results of a meta-analysis to evaluate and integrate a
number of studies conducted on the GI and its effects on
health. The present meta-analysis summarises results and
should further motivate and direct further research;
it
could form a ﬁrm, evidence-based platform for the use or
not of the GI in planning diets.

integrated in order

Methods

Randomised controlled trials with a crossover or parallel
design that were published between January 1981 and
April 2003 were selected through a computer-assisted lit-
erature search. EbscoHost Web was used as a gateway to
the databases Medline and Academic Search Premier.
The Science Direct and PubMed (1981 – 2003) databases
were also used to expand our search. Medical subject head-
ings (MeSH) such as ‘glycaemic index’ or ‘glycemic
index’ combined with key words (metabolic control, cardi-
ovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, obesity, weight, body
mass index, blood lipids, cholesterol, high-density lipopro-
tein-cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, total
cholesterol, triacylglycerol, glycated (glycosylated) haemo-
globin (hemoglobin), fructosamine, insulin, blood glucose)
were used to search for papers. Low-GI diets were deﬁned
as
those containing most carbohydrate from low-GI
sources, such as peas, lentils, beans, pasta, barley, par-
boiled rice, oats and cereals, known to have a low GI.
High-GI diets were those that contained potato, wheatmeal
and white bread and high-GI varieties of breakfast cereals
such as cornﬂakes and rice. Reference lists of all available
published trials and relevant reviews were cross-checked
manually to ensure that all applicable papers were
included. Where data were incomplete, authors of the
identiﬁed trials were contacted to supply comprehensive
information. The search was restricted to human studies
and only studies that were published in English were con-
sidered. Accepted interventions included a high-GI v. low-
GI diet, investigating the effect of the diet on carbohydrate
or lipid metabolism. The participants were patients with
type 2 DM, type 1 DM or CVD, or healthy adults. Only
studies with good quality methodology were considered.
Quality criteria were adapted from the Effective Practice
and Organization of Care Cochrane Group, and included
methods of randomisation, blinded assessment of variables
with regard to blood samples and determination of whether
an intention-to-treat analysis was possible on all patients
from the published data.

In addition, feeding periods had to be sufﬁciently long
($ 14 d) to allow the achievement of new steady-state con-
centrations of serum lipids and lipoproteins (Brussaard
et al. 1982) as well as fructosamine (10 – 14 d) and glycated
Hb (HbA1c; 90 d) (Lindsey et al. 2002), food intake had to
be controlled (either advice given, key foods provided or

all foods provided) and described (low-GI v. high-GI
diets), the GI of the diet had to be indicated, the subject
population had to be homogenous (at least for the main
risk factor), and the inclusion and exclusion criteria for
subjects had to be clearly deﬁned.

data. Co-investigators

Each potentially relevant study was assessed for inclusion
independently by at least two reviewers. Two investigators
(A. M. O. and C. S. V.), by means of an agreed standar-
dised data collection form, independently extracted the rel-
evant
of
disagreement or uncertainty and resolved it by discussion.
The k statistic for the agreement between the reviewers
was 0·6 (a good agreement). Information about the out-
come variables that was extracted for the randomised con-
trolled trials included: authors, publication date, number of
subjects, study design (crossover or parallel), duration of
the study, wash-out period (if applicable), subject charac-
teristics, the diet setting, reduction in GI, age, BMI and
weight (maintenance or loss), provision of test meals,
compliance, baseline and end values, mean change (end
value – baseline value), and the P value and SD for
both low-GI and high-GI groups. If SD were not presented,
data on SEM or 95 % CI were extracted. Measured vari-
ables included in the meta-analysis were: risk markers of
carbohydrate metabolism e.g. blood glucose, insulin, insu-
lin resistance, glycated plasma protein (HbA1c and fructo-
samine); risk markers for lipid metabolism e.g. TG, total
cholesterol (TC), HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and
weight.

Data analysis

We used the Cochrane software package (Review manager
4.2; Cochrane, Copenhagen, Denmark) to process results.
The mean difference over time for the high-GI diet was
subtracted from the mean difference of the low-GI diet
over time to get an overall difference between the two
treatments. For each trial, we estimated the SD of the treat-
ment effect for the outcome measures by using the SEM or
paired differences (end values – baseline values) for low-
GI and high-GI groups. If SD were not reported, they were
estimated using the methods described by Follmann et al.
(1992). The net changes in TC, LDL-cholesterol, HDL-
cholesterol, TG and blood glucose are presented in
mmol/l. Where variables were reported in mg/dl, convert-
ing factors were used (for TC, HDL-cholesterol and
LDL-cholesterol, values in mg/dl were multiplied by
0·0259;
for TG, values in mg/dl were multiplied by
0·0113 (Van Horn & Ernst, 2001)). The variables blood
glucose and insulin were not included in the meta-analysis,
due to units that were not comparable, different time inter-
vals of measurement, only insulin or glucose responses
reported,
incomplete and/or missing data, and only
graphs and/or response curves given to report data. Unstan-
dardised differences in mean values were examined using
the random effects model. Weighted mean differences in
mean values were also performed, because outcomes
were measured in a
studies.

standard way across

Differences between the results of the trials were checked
for heterogeneity by visual inspection of the graphs and by
statistical test (x2).

Results

The literature search yielded 413 references (titles and
abstracts, original research and review papers). Of these,
ninety-six original research papers were identiﬁed as poss-
ible studies to include in the meta-analysis. Two investi-
gators examined the full-text publications, of which
sixteen studies met
the inclusion criteria. The main
reason for exclusion was incomplete or missing data,
response curves only for some of the variables (actual
data not reported), and incompatible units. Details of the
studies included in the meta-analysis are shown in Table 1.
There were two studies conducted in healthy subjects
(Jenkins et al. 1987a; Bouche et al. 2002), two in CHD
(Frost et al. 1996, 1998), nine in type 2 diabetic subjects
(Jenkins et al. 1988; Brand et al. 1991; Wolever et al.
1992a; Frost et al. 1994; Heilbronn et al. 2002; Jarvi
et al. 1999; Luscombe et al. 1999; Tsihlias et al. 2000;
Kabir et al. 2002) and three studies in type 1 diabetics
(Collier et al. 1998; Lafrance et al. 1998; Gilbertson et al.
2001). Studies were carried out under free-living con-
ditions except for that of Frost et al. (1996), who studied
subjects who were hospitalised. Ten studies had a cross-
over and six a parallel design. A total of 396 subjects
were studied (type 1 DM n 105, type 2 DM n 228, healthy
n 17, CHD n 46). Intervention periods varied from 12 d to 6
months, wash-out periods from none to 7 weeks in cross-
over studies and a GI reduction of between 5 and 35
units was achieved. Studies that were excluded from the
meta-analysis were those of Jenkins et al. (1985, 1987b),
Wolever et al. (1992b), Calle-Pascual et al. (1988), Font-
vielle et al. (1988, 1992), Brynes et al. (2003), Gilbertson
et al. (2003) and Wolever & Mehling (2003), due to
incomplete data for the purpose of the present meta-anal-
ysis. The reason for exclusion of such high proﬁle studies
was that baseline and end values of variables were not
included, and therefore, SD could not be calculated.
Twelve of the included studies assessed markers for carbo-
hydrate metabolism, while fourteen studies assessed mar-
kers for lipid metabolism.

Table 2 shows the nutrient composition of high-GI and
low-GI intervention diets. The aim was to maintain the
same proportions of macronutrients and ﬁbre in both
diets, but
in some cases this was not achieved. Some
high-GI diets were higher in fat and lower in ﬁbre, compli-
cating the interpretation of results.

Explanation of forest plots

The type of graphical display in the present meta-analysis
used to report results is called a forest plot. The mean
results of each computed study and the 95 % CI are
reported. The midpoint of the square in the middle of the
forest plot represents the effect size (the mean difference
in the measure between low-GI and high-GI diets) and
the horizontal line the 95 % CI of the individual studies.
The size of the square relates to the weight each study

A. M. Opperman et al.

contributes to the meta-analysis (presented as a weighted
mean difference). The weights are usually in inverse pro-
portion to their variance, a method that gives more
weight to larger studies and to studies with less variation
in results. The diamond at the bottom of the graph gives
a summary of the included studies statistics, which rep-
resents the mean difference (between low-GI and high-GI
diets) and the 95 % CI (Vorster et al. 2003). When the dia-
mond does not touch the vertical line (the line of no effect)
in the middle of the plot, it indicates that the overall effect
is statistically signiﬁcant. A random effects model was
implemented to present the results. This model assumes
that the studies used are a random sample from a hypo-
thetical population of studies and consider both between-
study and within-study variation. Random effects models,
however, are more conservative, generate wider 95 % CI
and are less likely to show a signiﬁcant treatment effect
than the ﬁxed effects model when signiﬁcant heterogeneity
exists between studies (Clarke & Oxman, 2001). When
homogeneity dominates (as in the present meta-analysis)
both models give similar results.

Carbohydrate metabolism

Figs 1 and 2 represent the effects of low-GI v. high-GI
diets on carbohydrate metabolism. For the present study,
fructosamine and HbA1c were investigated. No heterogen-
eity (Higgins et al. 2003) was detected for fructosamine (I 2
0 %; Fig. 1). The random effects analysis demonstrated an
overall statistically signiﬁcant reduction in fructosamine in

subjects receiving the low-GI diet compared with the high-
GI diet (change 2 0·1 (95 % CI 2 0·20, 0·00) mmol/l;
P¼ 0·05). However, when studies were subgrouped into
DM and healthy subjects a non-signiﬁcant improvement
was observed in each group (DM, change 2 0·11 (95 %
CI 2 0·25, 0·03) mmol/l, P¼ 0·12; healthy, change 2 0·09
(95 % CI 2 0·24, 0·06) mmol/l, P¼ 0·25). The GI reduction
for the included studies was 24 (SD 9) units. Frost et al.
(1994) and Wolever et al. (1992a), who had the longest
intervention periods, found the biggest change in mean
fructosamine concentrations.

There was a statistically signiﬁcant decrease in mean
HbA1c concentrations in subjects receiving the low-GI
diet (change 2 0·27 (95 % CI 2 0·5, 2 0·03) %; P¼ 0·03)
(Fig. 2). No heterogeneity was detected (I 2 0 %). All the
studies included, except that of Lafrance et al. (1998),
in HbA1c concentrations. The
found an improvement
difference in GI between the low-GI and high-GI diets
was 21 (SD 7) units. Brand et al. (1991) observed the big-
gest change with an intervention period of 12 weeks. All
the included studies that measured HbA1c in the present
meta-analysis were performed on DM subjects.

Lipid metabolism

We investigated the effects of low-GI v. high-GI diets on
markers for lipid metabolism such as HDL-cholesterol,
LDL-cholesterol, TC and TG. Moderate heterogeneity
(I 2 32·4 %; Higgins et al. 2003) was detected for

Fig. 1. Net changes in fructosamine (mmol/l). GI, glycaemic index; WMD, weighted mean difference. For an explanation of the forest plot,
see p. 369. For details of selection of studies, see Table 1. GI, glycaemic index.

HDL-cholesterol. No heterogeneity (I 2 0 %) was observed
for LDL-cholesterol, TC and TG.

Lowering the GI of the intervention diets by 22 (SD 9)
units did not cause an overall signiﬁcant change in mean
HDL-cholesterol (change 2 0·03 (95 % CI 2 0·08, 0·02)
mmol/l; P¼ 0·23) (Fig. 3). From the forest plot it seems
that neither high-GI nor low-GI diets had an effect on
mean HDL-cholesterol concentrations in subjects with
type 2 DM. Only Frost et al. (1996) investigated the
effect of low-GI v. high-GI diets in subjects with CHD
Jenkins et al.
and found no signiﬁcant difference.
(1987a) and Bouche et al. (2002) found no statistically sig-
niﬁcant effect in healthy subjects.

Seven of the ten studies found an improvement in mean
LDL-cholesterol concentrations on a low-GI diet (Fig. 4).
Overall, low-GI diets tended to decrease LDL-cholesterol
concentrations; however, it was not statistically signiﬁcant
(change 2 0·15 (95 % CI 2 0·31, 0·00) mmol/l; P¼ 0·06).
The GI of the diets was decreased by 21 (SD 10) units.
In type 2 DM subjects, it seems that mean LDL-cholesterol
concentrations were decreased to a greater extent than in
subjects with CHD and healthy subjects. Larger decreases
in LDL-cholesterol were reported for longer studies in
well-controlled type 2 DM subjects (Brand et al. 1991;
Frost et al. 1994) except for an unexpected non-signiﬁcant
increase in mean LDL-cholesterol concentrations after 6
months, as reported by Tsihlias et al. (2000).

(change 2 0·33 (95 % CI 2 0·47, 2 0·18) mmol/l;
P, 0·001). This improvement was achieved by lowering
the GI of the intervention diet by 22 (SD 8) units. Larger
decreases in TC concentrations were observed in patients
with elevated TC baseline concentrations (. 5·2 mmol/l)
(Jenkins et al. 1988; Brand et al. 1991; Wolever et al.
1992a; Frost et al. 1994, 1996; Jarvi et al. 1999; Luscombe
et al. 1999; Bouche et al. 2002; Heilbronn et al. 2002;
Kabir et al. 2002). Two studies showed that mean TC con-
centrations of healthy subjects signiﬁcantly improved on
low-GI diets (Jenkins et al. 1988; Bouche et al. 2002),
while the studies of Frost et al. (1996, 1998) found no
change in patients with CHD (Fig. 5).

Only six of the thirteen studies showed an improvement
in TG concentrations with a low-GI diet. Furthermore, the
overall change was not statistically signiﬁcant (change 0·03
(95 % CI 2 0·12, 0·17); P¼ 0·73). No improvement was
observed by lowering the GI of the intervention diet by
20 (SD 9) units. When divided into subgroups no difference
was found within type 2 DM, CHD or healthy subjects
(Fig. 6). No effect was observed when only subjects with
elevated TG concentrations were included.

of blood glucose control statistically signiﬁcantly. When
dividing studies into subgroups of DM (type 1 and type
2) and healthy subjects, a non-signiﬁcant decrease was
reported for fructosamine in each group. However, the
overall decrease was signiﬁcant. HbA1c was reported
only in DM subjects and a statistically signiﬁcant decrease
was observed. Decreases in fructosamine and HbA1c
observed in the present meta-analysis are generally consist-
ent with individual published reports. There was no hetero-
geneity among individual studies, suggesting that effects of
low-GI diets on blood glucose control are uniform.
Although studies included were of relatively short duration
and small numbers of subjects participated, these results
indicate that beneﬁcial effects exist when using low-GI
diets instead of high-GI diets in planning diets for DM sub-
jects as well as healthy subjects. These ﬁndings are in
accordance with meta-analyses conducted by Brand-
Miller (1994), Brand-Miller et al. (2003) and Wolever
(2003), who looked mainly at the inﬂuence of the GI on
markers for carbohydrate metabolism. However, Brand-
Miller et al. (2003) found a slightly larger reduction in gly-
cated proteins, probably because of different statistical
methods, a combination of the measurements of HbA1c
and fructosamine, and access to a larger number of studies.
Our present meta-analysis is the ﬁrst to investigate the
effects of low-GI diets on markers for lipid as well as
carbohydrate metabolism.

Fructosamine

Fructosamine is measured as a short-term (2 weeks) index
of glycaemic control. Glycated albumin is the main con-
stituent of fructosamine and has a half-life of only 12 d,
explaining the usefulness of fructosamine as a short-term
marker (Kumar & Clarke, 1998). The studies of Jenkins
et al. (1987a, 1988) contributed the most weight to the
meta-analysis, irrespective of the fact that only six and
eight subjects participated in the studies and intervention
periods were only 2 weeks long. This could be attributed
to the small CI of the studies. Frost et al. (1994) and Wole-
ver et al. (1992a) found the biggest improvement in mean
fructosamine concentrations. These two studies had the
longest intervention periods. Although fructosamine is a
shorter-term marker
than
HbA1c, it seems that the longer low-GI diets are followed,
the larger the decreases in fructosamine concentrations that
are observed. According to Jones et al. (1983), maximum
changes in fructosamine take 4 – 6 weeks to occur. More
profound decreases were documented in DM subjects
than in healthy subjects. Results would probably be more
representative if all available studies conducted on fructo-
samine and the GI could be included, but due to a lack of
complete data (mean values and SD of baseline and end
the combined
values) this was not possible. However,
meta-analysis suggests that

mean fructosamine concentrations by 0·1 mmol/l above
that seen with high-GI diets over a period of 4·6 (SD 3)
weeks. GI reductions of 24 (SD 9) units were achieved.

Glycated Hb

HbA1c is a longer-term marker for carbohydrate metabo-
lism than fructosamine. This test provides an index of
the average blood glucose concentration over the half-life
of the Hb molecule (approximately 6 weeks) (Kumar &
Clarke, 1998). Studies that lasted longer than 4 weeks
showed greater improvements in HbA1c concentrations
than in shorter studies. However, the study of Tsihlias
et al. (2000) lasted 6 months, but no improvement
in
HbA1c concentration was seen. This may be attributed to
the fact that only a small GI reduction of 11 units was
observed, the GI of only one meal (breakfast) was lowered
and the possibility of poorer compliance with longer
studies exists. Brand et al. (1991) attained the biggest
reduction over a period of 12 weeks, although the GI
reduction was only 13 units. They studied well-controlled
DM subjects and reduced the GI of the whole diet and
not just a single meal. Nonetheless, from these results
one may conclude that low-GI diets beneﬁcially inﬂuenced
long-term glycaemic control. A signiﬁcant reduction of
0·27 % in HbA1c concentrations may be expected over a
period of 8 (SD 8) weeks with a GI reduction of 21(SD 7)
units. In addition, more than one type of low-GI food

may need to be incorporated into the diet to achieve mea-
surable long-term improvements in glycaemic control.
Differences in fructosamine and HbA1c might be con-
founded by differences in energy intake or weight loss.
In most studies body weight, energy intake, fat, protein
and carbohydrate and ﬁbre intake were held constant.

incidence of

Poor blood glucose control has been associated with a
greater
long-term macrovascular compli-
cations in both type 1 and type 2 DM patients (Balkau
et al. 1998; UK Prospective Diabetes Study Group, 1998;
Couthinho et al. 1999; Stratton et al. 2000). The UK Pro-
spective Diabetes Study Group found that each 1 %
reduction in mean HbA1c concentration was associated
with reductions in risk of 21 % for deaths related to dia-
betes, 14 % for myocardial infarction and 37 % for micro-
vascular complications. It is not clear precisely how low-
GI diets improve the markers of carbohydrate metabolism
and prevent the onset of type 2 DM. Several mechanisms
have been proposed. Brieﬂy, high-GI diets have been
associated with high postprandial blood glucose concen-
trations and increased insulin demands (Ludwig, 2002;
Willet et al. 2002). Primary hyperinsulinaemia may cause
insulin resistance, which reduces insulin sensitivity. In
addition, habitual consumption of high-GI meals in the
long-term initiates a cycle of hyperinsulinaemia and insulin
resistance, leading to a loss of pancreatic b-cell function
(Ludwig, 2002);
in glucose intolerance
and an irreversible state of DM (Willet et al. 2002).

Hyperglycaemia also causes deleterious effects on counter-
regulatory hormone secretion, increased late postprandial
serum NEFA concentrations (Ludwig, 2002) and leads to
the occurrence of oxidative stress (Augustin et al. 2002).
Low-GI diets, on the other hand, tend to delay glucose
absorption, thereby resulting in reduced peak insulin con-
centrations and overall insulin demand (Augustin et al.
2002).

Considering epidemiological evidence,

the cross-sec-
tional EURODIAB Complications Study (n 2054) reported
that the lower GI diet of European outpatients with type 1
DM was associated with signiﬁcantly lower HbA1c concen-
trations. Compared with the highest GI quartile, adjusted
HbA1c in the lowest quartile was 11 % lower in patients
from southern European centres and 6 % lower in patients
from the rest of the European centres (Buyken et al. 2001).
Furthermore, the Framingham Heart Study showed a strong
positive association between prevalence of CHD and
increased HbA1c concentrations, suggesting the importance
of hyperglycaemia in the development of CHD (Singer
et al. 1992).

Lipid metabolism

The present meta-analysis pooled the results of fourteen
randomised controlled trials studying low-GI v. high-GI
diets and their effects on markers for lipid metabolism.

improvement

In the studies reviewed, low-GI diets caused a statistically
signiﬁcant
in TC concentrations, while
non-signiﬁcant
improvements were observed in LDL-
cholesterol. No signiﬁcant change was found in TG and
HDL-cholesterol with low-GI diets. The unchanged
HDL-cholesterol concentrations were somewhat unex-
pected, since cross-sectional studies, such as the Survey
of British Adults (1986 – 1987; Frost et al. 1999) and the
Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(1988 – 1994; Ford & Liu, 2001), found an increase in
HDL-cholesterol concentrations with low-GI diets in the
long term. It should also be noted that differences in
lipids might be confounded by differences in energy
intake or weight
In most studies body weight,
energy intake, fat, protein and carbohydrate and ﬁbre
intake were held constant.

loss.

HDL-cholesterol

A possible explanation for the unchanged HDL-cholesterol
concentrations is the length of studies. Intervention periods
differed from 2 weeks to 6 months. Although the study of
Tsihlias et al. (2000) was the longest (6 months), they also
observed no effect. However, in that study the GI of only
one meal (breakfast) was lowered.

A low HDL-cholesterol concentration is a strong inde-
pendent predictor of CHD and has several causes, many

of which are associated with insulin resistance, elevated
TG, overweight and obesity, physical inactivity and type
2 DM (Adult Treatment Panel
III, 2001). While we
found no signiﬁcant change for HDL-cholesterol in ran-
domised controlled trials, some cross-sectional epidemiolo-
gical studies found improvements. In the Third National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1988 – 1994)
an inverse relationship was found between the GI and
HDL-cholesterol concentrations (n 13 907). Ford & Liu
(2001) reported a statistically signiﬁcant change in HDL-
cholesterol concentrations of 2 0·06 mmol/l per 15 unit
increase in the GI, after adjusting for covariates such as
gender, BMI, smoking status, alcohol
intake, physical
activity, energy intake derived from fat and carbohydrate,
etc. HDL-cholesterol concentrations for the lowest and
the highest GI quintiles were 1·36 and 1·28 mmol/l
respectively.

Frost et al. (1999), who reported data from the Survey of
British Adults (1986 – 1987), found a signiﬁcant negative
relationship between serum HDL-cholesterol concentration
and the GI of the diet for both men (P¼ 0·02) and women
(P, 0·0001). For women the improvement in HDL-choles-
terol concentrations between the lowest and the highest
quintile of the GI was 0·25 mmol/l, representing a possible
29 % reduction in CHD morbidity. In men the potential
decrease in CHD morbidity was found to be 7 %, reﬂecting

a 0·09 mmol/l difference in HDL-cholesterol concentration
between the lowest and the highest quintiles of the GI.

In the EURODIAB Complications Study, higher HDL-
cholesterol concentrations were observed in patients from
the northern, eastern and western European centres who
consumed low-GI diets. The observed relationships of the
dietary GI with HDL-cholesterol concentrations were inde-
pendent of dietary ﬁbre intake (Buyken et al. 2001).
However,
in the Zutphen Elderly Study, conducted on
elderly male subjects, no associations were found between
the GI and HDL-cholesterol concentrations. These differ-
ences in ﬁndings between the epidemiological studies
could be attributed to the age and gender differences
between study populations (Van Dam et al. 2000).

Although no overall improvement in HDL-cholesterol
was found in the present meta-analysis such an improve-
ment was expected, because low-GI foods are associated
with reduced hepatic gluconeogenesis, suppression of
NEFA release and therefore increases in the HDL-choles-
fraction (Wolever 2000; Rizkalla et al. 2002).

epidemiological studies could be due to the difference in
the length of intervention periods. Therefore, long-term
intervention studies are needed to assess the effects of
low-GI diets on HDL-cholesterol concentrations (Frost
et al. 1999).

LDL-cholesterol

Frost et al. (1994) and Wolever et al. (1992a) reported the
most profound improvement in LDL-cholesterol concen-
trations. In the study of Frost et al. (1994) the GI of the
whole diet was lowered by only 5 units over a 12-week
period, while Wolever et al. (1992a) reduced the GI of
the diet by 28 units over a 6-week period. Jarvi et al.
(1999) and Brand et al.
(1991) also found notable
decreases in LDL-cholesterol concentrations after periods
of 24 d and 12 weeks respectively, and with GI reductions
of 19 and 13 units. Nutrient compositions within the
studies of Wolever et al. (1992a), Jarvi et al. (1999) and
Brand et al. (1991), as well as between the high-GI and
low-GI groups, remained the same. Therefore, the tendency
for LDL-cholesterol to decrease can be attributed to the
effect of the low-GI diets. The most substantial effects
were observed in type 2 DM subjects. The GI reduction
of only 5 units in the study of Frost et al. (1994) is
small. They concluded that the effect of the change in
LDL-cholesterol could be caused by changes in dietary
constituents due to a signiﬁcant drop in fat intake and a sig-
niﬁcant increase in ﬁbre intake in the group that followed
the low-GI diet (Frost et al. 1994). The low-GI group
also had higher baseline LDL-cholesterol concentrations
than the control group.

Not all available studies conducted on the GI and LDL-
cholesterol could be included. The randomised controlled
trials of Jenkins et al. (1985, 1987b) showed promising
results on low-GI diets and LDL-cholesterol, but did not
report mean values and SD for the change. Both these
studies found signiﬁcant
improvements in LDL-choles-
terol concentrations with low-GI diets. However, epide-
miological studies, such as the Zutphen Elderly Study
(Van Dam et al. 2000) and the EURODIAB Compli-
cations Study (Buyken et al. 2001), failed to prove a
relationship between LDL-cholesterol concentrations and
low-GI diets.

When comparing corresponding studies that measured
markers for carbohydrate metabolism and LDL-cholesterol
(Brand et al. 1991; Jarvi et al. 1999; Heilbronn et al.
2002),
improvements in LDL-cholesterol concentrations
were observed where decreases
in fructosamine and
HbA1c were perceived. But how can low-GI diets contrib-
ute to lower LDL-cholesterol concentrations? A possible
mechanism may be that
insulin resistance may occur
with consumption of a high-GI meal because of
the
direct effects of hyperglycaemia (Ludwig, 2002). Insulin
resistance impairs normal suppression of NEFA release
from adipose tissue in the postprandial state (Granberry
& Fonseca, 1999). According to Timar et al. (2000),
increased NEFA released from abdominal adipose tissue,
delivered to the liver, offers an efﬁcient substrate for
enhanced synthesis of TG and VLDL-cholesterol, resulting
in elevated cholesterol concentrations.

(Garg, 1996). Barakat

Furthermore, with the prevalence of insulin resistance as
seen in type 2 DM subjects, LDL-receptor activity is
reduced, resulting in less LDL-cholesterol removal from
the blood, thereby contributing to higher LDL-cholesterol
concentrations
(1996)
explained that reduced receptor activity may be attributed
to glycation of the LDL-particle in the presence of hyper-
glycaemia. Glycated LDL-cholesterol cannot bind as efﬁ-
ciently as non-glycated LDL because of impairment in
the binding of the LDL particles to LDL-receptors; there-
fore, glycated LDL particles will remain in the circulation
longer.

et al.

From these results it seems that

low-GI diets have
favourable effects on LDL-cholesterol concentrations in
type 2 DM subjects. A reduction of 0·15 mmol/l in LDL-
cholesterol concentrations with low-GI diets can be
expected over a period of 10 (SD 7) weeks with a reduction
of 28 (SD 8) units in the GI of the diet. It is also re-
commended that more long-term studies should be per-
formed to investigate the relationship between low-GI
diets and LDL-cholesterol.

Total cholesterol

the included studies, except

There was no substantial heterogeneity (Higgins et al.
2003) among included studies, suggesting that the effects
of low-GI diets on TC are uniform. Considering type 2
DM subjects, all
that of
Tsihlias et al. (2000), reported elevated (. 5·2 mmol/l)
baseline TC concentrations. After receiving low-GI inter-
vention diets all the studies showed an improvement in
TC to some extent. Only the study of Tsihlias et al.
(2000) found a slight increase in TC with low-GI diets.
No signiﬁcant improvements were observed in the two
studies conducted on CHD patients, while a signiﬁcant
reduction was observed in the two studies performed on
healthy subjects. From these ﬁndings it can be concluded
that by lowering the GI by 19 (SD 8) units over 8 (SD 6)
weeks, a signiﬁcant decrease of 0·3 mmol/l can be expected
in TC concentrations of type 2 DM subjects. However,
epidemiological evidence from the EURODIAB Compli-
cations Study (Buyken et al. 2001), the Zutphen Elderly
Study (Van Dam et al. 2000) and the Survey of British
Adults (Frost et al. 1999) failed to show any inverse
relationship between low-GI diets and TC.

lower

The mechanisms by which low-GI diets may reduce TC
concentrations remain unclear. Speculatively, these mech-
anisms involve:
insulin-stimulated 2-hydroxy-2-
methylglutaryl-CoA reductase activity as a result of a
reduced rate of carbohydrate absorption;
impaired bile
acid and cholesterol reabsorption from the ileum due to
the high ﬁbre content of low-GI foods; inhibition of hepatic
cholesterol
such as propionate

We could not ﬁnd notable effects on TG concentrations

Contrary to the general belief, an inverse relationship
between low-GI diets and TG was found. According to
Wolever et al. (1992b), insulin regulates both cholesterol
and TG synthesis. One would therefore expect an
improvement in TG concentrations, because markers for
carbohydrate metabolism (HbA1c) in the present meta-
analysis signiﬁcantly improved. Furthermore,
it appears
obvious
improved blood glucose control would
reduce insulin resistance accompanied by an improve-
ment in TG concentrations. Nevertheless, intra-individual
biological variation in TG concentrations has been well
documented (Nazir et al. 1999; Castro Cabezas et al.
2001). According to Nazir et al.
(1999) and Castro
Cabezas et al. (2001), several factors contribute to the
variation of TG, such as intervention diet (amount of
fat and carbohydrate), exercise, alcohol consumption,

Conclusion

From the present meta-analysis on randomised controlled
trials, it is clear that implementing the GI concept in choos-
ing carbohydrate-containing foods beneﬁcially inﬂuenced
carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. These results are
supported by experimental evidence from the last 20 years.
The low-GI diets signiﬁcantly improved blood glucose
control in type 2 DM subjects. These ﬁndings were in
accordance with other meta-analyses conducted on markers
of carbohydrate metabolism (Brand-Miller, 1994; Brand-
Miller et al. 2003; Wolever, 2003). Regarding lipid metabo-
lism, a signiﬁcant improvement in LDL-cholesterol and TC
was observed for type 2 DM subjects, while TG and HDL-
cholesterol concentrations were not inﬂuenced. Only two
randomised controlled trials were performed: CHD patients
and healthy subjects. No notable effects of a low-GI diet on
lipid and carbohydrate metabolism were observed in these
patients. It is therefore difﬁcult to draw a ﬁnal conclusion.
More studies should therefore be conducted in non-DM
subjects to investigate the effect of
low-GI diets on
HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and TC concentrations.
Furthermore, many of the studies included in the present
meta-analysis involved only small numbers of subjects
and were of short duration: it is recommended that more
long-term studies should be conducted.

Nonetheless, results from the present meta-analysis sup-
port the use of the GI as a scientiﬁcally based tool in
selecting carbohydrate-containing foods. It appears that a
low-GI diet has independent effects contributing to a
healthy diet. When incorporating these beneﬁts with
other dietary interventions such as a high-ﬁbre and low-
saturated-fat diet, and adequate amounts of micronutrients,
the inﬂuence of low-GI diets will probably be magniﬁed
and clinically signiﬁcant effects may be expected.

Abstract
Objective: Adherence to a Mediterranean diet
is associated with signiﬁcant
improvements in health status. However, to date no systematic review and meta-
analysis has summarized the effects of Mediterranean diet adherence on the risk of
type 2 diabetes mellitus.
Design: Electronic searches for randomized controlled trials and cohort studies
were performed in MEDLINE, SCOPUS, EMBASE and the Cochrane Trial Register
until 2 April 2014. Pooled effects were calculated by an inverse-variance random-
effect meta-analysis using the statistical software Review Manager 5·2 by the
Cochrane Collaboration.
Setting: Meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials and cohort studies.
Subjects: Eligibility criteria: 19+ years of age.
Results: One randomized controlled trial and eight prospective cohort studies
(122 810 subjects) published between 2007 and 2014 were included for meta-
analysis. For highest v. lowest adherence to the Mediterranean diet score, the
pooled risk ratio was 0·81 (95 % CI 0·73, 0·90, P < 0·0001, I 2 = 55 %). Sensitivity
analysis including only long-term studies conﬁrmed the results of the primary
analysis (pooled risk ratio = 0·75; 95 % CI 0·68, 0·83, P < 0·00001, I 2 = 0 %). The
Egger regression test provided no evidence of substantial publication bias
(P = 0·254).
Conclusions: Greater adherence to a Mediterranean diet is associated with a
signiﬁcant reduction in the risk of diabetes (19 %; moderate quality evidence).
These results seem to be clinically relevant for public health, in particular for
encouraging a Mediterranean-like dietary pattern for primary prevention of type 2
diabetes mellitus.

Systematic review

The worldwide incidence of people with type 2 diabetes
mellitus (T2DM) is projected to rise from 171 million in
2000 to 380 million in 2025, causing enormous costs for
health-care systems(1). The typical Mediterranean diet
(MD), which was ﬁrst postulated by Ancel Keys in the
1960s(2), is characterized by high intakes of MUFA, vege-
tables and fruits, plant proteins, whole grains, ﬁsh and
low-fat dairy products, moderate alcohol
(red wine)
intake, and low red meat consumption(3). In the Seven
Countries Study, Keys reported the beneﬁcial effects of
an MD on human health(2). Since then, dietary pattern
analysis has been widely used to detect the cumulative
effects of diet on health. T2DM is a major chronic
disease originating from different genetic, behavioural and

environmental risks(4), with impaired glucose tolerance
being an indicator for the development of a diabetic
metabolic state(5). Lifestyle intervention studies in rando-
mized trial settings have demonstrated a reduction in the
relative risk to develop T2DM of 30–67 %(6) with sustain-
able long-term reduction of incidence(7,8), although a need
to develop standardized lifestyle interventions may be
necessary to enhance their efﬁcacy(9). MD is a homo-
geneous and straightforward construct having its roots in
southern European eating patterns. Adherence to an MD is
associated with signiﬁcant improvements in health status
ranging from reduced risk of mortality to neurodegen-
erative diseases(10,11). However,
to date no systematic
review and meta-analysis has summarized the effects of

MD adherence on the risk of T2DM. Therefore, the aim of
the present study was to meta-analyse randomized con-
trolled trials and cohort studies that have assessed the
effect of adherence to an MD on the risk of T2DM.

Methods

Literature search
Literature searches were performed using the electronic
databases MEDLINE, SCOPUS, EMBASE and the Cochrane
Trial Register until 2 April 2014 using the following key-
words: ‘Mediterranean diet AND diabetes’. Moreover, the
reference lists from retrieved articles were checked to
search for further relevant studies, and systematic reviews
and meta-analysis were searched by two authors. The
literature search as well as article abstraction was conducted
independently by two authors (L.S. and B.M.). Relevance of
studies was assessed with a hierarchical approach (title,
abstract and full manuscript). After an initial screening of
titles and abstracts, studies included by both reviewers were
compared and disagreement was resolved by consensus.

Eligibility criteria
Studies were included in the meta-analysis if they met all
of the following criteria: (i) randomized controlled trial or
cohort study design; (ii) reported adjusted relative risks
(RR)
for T2DM with corresponding 95 % conﬁdence
intervals; (iii) evaluated the association of an a priori score
used for assessing adherence to an MD; and (iv) when a
study seemed to have been published in duplicate, the
version containing the most comprehensive information
was selected. Studies including pregnant women were
excluded, as were case–control studies, cross-sectional
studies and studies that were not published as original
reports (such as conference abstracts, letters to the editor
without original data, commentaries and reviews).

Quality assessment
Full copies of studies were independently assessed for
methodological quality by two authors (L.S. and B.M.) using
the Jadad score for randomized controlled trials and the
Newcastle Ottawa Scale for cohort studies(12,13) (Table 1).

Data extraction
Two investigators (L.S. and B.M.) independently collected
the relevant
reports using a standardized form. The
following data were extracted from each study: (i) ﬁrst
author’s last name; (ii) year of publication; (iii) country of
origin; (iv) sample size; (v) study length; (vi) age at entry;
(vii) sex; (viii) T2DM diagnosis criteria; (ix) study design;
(x) components of the MD score; (xi) adjustment factors;
(xii) quality score; (xiii) dietary assessment method; and
(xiv) risk estimates with their corresponding 95 % con-
ﬁdence intervals. When a study provided several risk
estimates, the maximally adjusted models were chosen.

Statistical analysis
The meta-analysis was performed with the adjusted RR of
the highest compared with the lowest MD adherence
score based on random-effects modelling according to
DerSimonian and Laird incorporating both within- and
between-study variability. To evaluate the weighting of
each study, the SE for log(RR) of each study was calculated
and regarded as the estimated variance of log(RR)(14).
Random-effects modelling with restricted maximum like-
lihood estimate, which is more appropriate if the number
of included studies is small, was also used to conﬁrm the
ﬁnal risk estimates. Heterogeneity was estimated by the
Cochrane Q test together with the I 2 statistic. An I 2 value
>50 % indicates substantial heterogeneity across studies(15).
Funnel plots were used to assess potential publication
bias. To determine the presence of publication bias, the
symmetry of the funnel plots in which mean differences
were plotted against their corresponding SE was assessed. In
addition, the Egger test was performed to test for potential
publication bias(16).

Results

Literature search
Nine papers extracted from 1408 articles met the eligibility
criteria and were included in the quantitative analysis(17–25).
One cohort study was excluded since the primary outcome
was the risk of gestational diabetes(26). The detailed steps of
the meta-analysis article selection process are described as a
ﬂow diagram in Fig. 1.

Study characteristics
One randomized controlled trial and eight prospective
cohort studies (sample size: 122 810 subjects) published
between 2007 and 2014 were included for meta-analysis.
Study duration plus follow-up ranged between 3·2 and
20 years. All cohort studies used an FFQ for dietary
assessment. General study characteristics are summarized
in Table 1.

To assess the quality of the included studies, a 9-point
scoring system was used according to the Newcastle
Ottawa Scale. A score of ≥7 points was deﬁned as high
study quality study (see online supplementary material,
Table S1); all cohort studies were of high quality. The
cut-offs for the high v. low MD score differed between the
studies (three cohorts used quintiles(17,18,20), two studies
used quartiles(23,26) and tertiles(19,22), and one study used
cluster analysis(21)).

Mediterranean diet and risk of diabetes
The pooled RR for the highest v. lowest adherence to the
MD score was 0·81 (95 % CI 0·73, 0·90, P < 0·0001, I 2 = 55 %;
Fig. 2). Stratiﬁed RR are summarized in Table S2 (see
online supplementary material). For studies with a long-
term follow-up (≥10 years), an RR of 0·75 (95 % CI 0·68,

I 2 = 67 %) could be observed. There was a signiﬁcant
association in the European analysis (RR = 0·81; 95 % CI

0·71, 0·93, P = 0·002) but not in the US analysis (RR = 0·82;
95 % CI 0·68, 1·00, P = 0·05). Exclusion of studies by Tobias
et al.(24) (history of gestational diabetes) and Mozaffarian
et al.(20) (secondary prevention of CVD) conﬁrmed the

1298
results of the main analysis (RR = 0·84; 95 % CI 0·75, 0·94,
P = 0·003, I 2 = 57 %). Since cut-off and MD scores varied
between studies, we performed a sensitivity analysis inves-
tigating the association between a 2-point
increase of
adherence to the MD score (deﬁned by Trichopoulou(27))
and the risk of T2DM. Six of nine(17–19,22,23,26) studies
were included and showed a signiﬁcant risk reduction
(RR = 0·93; 95 % CI 0·89, 0·98, P = 0·007, I 2 = 69 %; see
online supplementary material, Fig. S1).

Publication bias
The funnel plots for diabetes incidence indicated low
asymmetry (with the exception of one outlier), suggesting
that
the risk of publication bias is low (see online
supplementary material, Fig. S2). The Egger test for small
study effects yielded non-signiﬁcant results (P = 0·254).

Discussion

The present meta-analysis including > 100 000 subjects
revealed a signiﬁcant association between adherence to
dietary patterns exhibiting speciﬁc MD characteristics and
decreased risk of T2DM. The overall quality of evidence
rated according to the GRADE guidelines for the main
outcome was moderate(28). To the best of our knowledge,
the present study represents the ﬁrst meta-analysis showing
a possible association between adherence to an MD and
risk of T2DM.

With respect to potential mechanisms of action, there
seems to be a causal
link between oxidative stress,
inﬂammation, endothelial dysfunction and diabetes(29).
Interconnections between MD and markers of inﬂammation/
endothelial function have been suggested by a recent meta-
analysis of intervention trials(30). Different adherence scores
measuring compliance to an MD were used in epidemiolo-
gical studies since Keys’ ﬁrst ﬁndings, and one of the most
relevant scores was established by Trichopoulou et al.(27).
Several studies of the present meta-analysis used MD scores
based on Trichopoulou et al. with only slight variations.
The combination of components and the adherence to the
whole concept of an MD seems pivotal: increasing fruit
and vegetable intake as a sole option only showed weak
overall effects on risk for developing T2DM(31). Making
use of synergistic effects of different nutrient compounds
especially in an MD has shown to be more distinct and
effective. Thus, compared with targeting single nutrients
on their health impact, dietary pattern analysis is especially
useful
in a public health context providing clear-cut
messages for stakeholders.

In our meta-analysis, the relative risk for developing
T2DM when adhering to an MD was signiﬁcantly different
when comparing European and US studies. Risk for
T2DM development was signiﬁcantly more decreased in
European studies as compared with their US counterparts.
This ﬁnding may be due to confounders that were

L Schwingshackl et al.

not assessed in the various studies. Subgroup analysis
including studies of great population (sample size ≥10 000)
and long-term follow-up (≥10 years) resulted in a more
pronounced effect of MD adherence on T2DM (RR = 0·82,
P = 0·005, I 2 = 67 % and RR = 0·75, P < 0·00001, I 2 = 0 %)
when compared with studies with a smaller sample size
(<10 000) or short-term studies (<10 years). Especially
long-term follow-up showed a prominent and signiﬁcant
decrease of T2DM risk of 25 %, suggesting a beneﬁcial long-
term effect of MD on T2DM risk.

There are some limitations to our study that should be
considered. First, although most studies used a stringent
MD score computation based on Trichopoulous et al.(27),
a more homogeneous MD score computation would
be desirable to make studies even more comparable.
Second, two studies with a slightly different study and
population design (Mozaffarian et al., secondary preven-
tion of CVD(20); Tobias et al., volunteers with history of
gestational diabetes(24)) were included in the present
meta-analysis. Thus, all subjects in these studies had a
history of a disease, which may be associated with higher
diabetes risk than for healthy subjects. However, results
of
the primary analysis could be conﬁrmed following
exclusion of
the respective studies. High inter-study
heterogeneity most likely results in a reduction in relia-
bility of estimates. Since considerable heterogeneity could
be observed for the primary analysis in the present
systematic review, additional sensitivity analyses were
performed to evaluate whether this could have been due
to a single study. However, no single study seemed to
have a considerable effect on heterogeneity. Furthermore,
meta-analyses are limited by the included study types and
cohort studies are at risk of various potential sources of
bias. For example, response bias as well as errors in the
assessment of diets is a persistent problem when analysing
associations between diet and disease.

Conclusion

In conclusion, the current systematic review and meta-
analysis shows that adherence to an MD is associated with
a decreased risk of becoming diabetic at a reasonable
magnitude (19 %). Overall, the present study supports the
relevancy and effectiveness of a long-term adherence to
an MD as an important measure in the primary prevention
of T2DM.

Abstract
Aims/hypothesis Diet is thought to play an important role in
the aetiology of type 2 diabetes. Previous studies have found
positive associations between meat consumption and the risk
of type 2 diabetes, but the results have been inconsistent. We
conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of cohort
studies of meat consumption and type 2 diabetes risk.
Methods We searched several databases for cohort studies
on meat consumption and type 2 diabetes risk, up to
December 2008. Summary relative risks were estimated by
use of a random-effects model.
Results We identified 12 cohort studies. The estimated
summary RR and 95% confidence interval of type 2
diabetes comparing high vs low intake was 1.17 (95% CI
0.92–1.48) for total meat, 1.21 (95% CI 1.07–1.38) for red
meat and 1.41 (95% CI 1.25–1.60) for processed meat.
There was heterogeneity amongst the studies of total, red
and processed meat which, to some degree, was explained
by the study characteristics.
Conclusions/interpretation These results suggest that meat
consumption increases the risk of type 2 diabetes. However,

Introduction

The prevalence of diabetes mellitus is rapidly increasing
worldwide. In 2000 an estimated 171 million people had
diabetes mellitus worldwide and the number is expected to
increase to 366 million by 2030 [1]. Ninety per cent of
patients with diabetes have type 2 diabetes mellitus, thus
type 2 diabetes accounts for most of the increase in diabetes
prevalence. Patients with type 2 diabetes are at increased
including cardiovascular
risk for several complications,
disease,
leg
ulcers and gangrene [2]. The total costs of diabetes were
estimated at US$174 billion in 2007 in the USA [3].

retinopathies, nephropathies, neuropathies,

Although overweight, obesity and physical inactivity are
established risk factors for type 2 diabetes [4] and may
account for much of the increase in rates of type 2 diabetes,
evidence suggests that dietary factors may also influence
the risk of type 2 diabetes [5]. An ecological study from
1935 [6] and subsequent migration studies [7, 8] suggest
that a Western-type diet may be a risk factor for type 2
diabetes. Consistent with this, secular trends in Japan show
a positive correlation between the intake of animal fat and

populations [10–12]. A Western dietary pattern has been
associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes in cohort
studies [13–15], but it is not clear which component(s) of
this dietary pattern may increase the risk of type 2 diabetes.
Snowdon and Phillips [16] first reported an association
between meat intake and diabetes in a study of Seventh Day
Adventists, a population with a high proportion of
vegetarians. Meat intake was associated with: an increased
prevalence of diabetes in men and women; and an increased
diabetes-associated mortality in men, but not in women.
Several subsequent publications have reported an increased
risk of diabetes or type 2 diabetes with a high intake of
processed meat [17–23], red meat [17–19, 22, 24, 25] and
total meat [15, 17, 23], but
the results have not been
consistent [20, 21, 26, 27]. To clarify this association we
conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of cohort
studies of meat intake and type 2 diabetes.

Methods

Search strategy We searched the PubMed, Medline (OVID),
CINAHL and ISI Web of Science (Science Citation Index
Expanded and Conference Proceedings Citation Index-
Science) from their starting dates to December 2008 for the
following search terms: meat, red meat, processed meat, total
meat, food or nutrition combined with diabetes, diabetes
mellitus or type 2 diabetes, with the searches limited to
humans and adults in PubMed. We had no language
restrictions in the searches. The reference lists of all the
studies that were included in the analysis and of relevant
systematic reviews were examined for further studies. We
contacted the authors of five studies [15, 17, 20–22] to obtain
sufficient detail in order to conduct a dose–response analysis
and we received detailed information from all these studies.

Study selection To be included, the study had to have a
cohort design and investigate the relationship between the
intake of total meat, red meat and/or processed meat and
incidence or mortality of type 2 diabetes. Risk ratios,
incidence rate ratios or odds ratios (hereafter referred to as
relative risks) had to be available with 95% confidence
intervals either in the publication or on request from the
authors. For the dose–response analysis, a quantitative
measure of intake had to be presented in the publication or
be obtainable from the authors. When several publications
from the same study were available, only the most recent or
most detailed publication was used.

Data extraction We extracted the following information
from each publication into a table: the country where the
study was conducted, the sample size and number of cases
or deaths,
the method for identification of cases and

whether the method for assessing diabetes status was
validated, the year the study started and ended, the duration
of follow-up,
the method of dietary assessment (food
frequency questionnaire [FFQ], or diet history, only
baseline or updated dietary assessment and whether the
method had been validated), the type of meat and frequency
or quantity of intake, the RRs and 95% CIs, and the factors
for which adjustment was made (Table 1).

Statistical methods We used random effects models, which
take into account within- and between-study variation, to
calculate summary RRs and 95% CIs for the highest vs the
lowest level of consumption [28]. The average of the natural
logarithm of the RRs was estimated and the RR from each
study was weighted by the inverse of its variance. A two-
tailed p<0.05 was considered statistically significant. The
statistical analyses were conducted using Stata, version 9.2
software (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA).

[29]

for

least

We used the method described by Greenland and
the dose–response analysis and
Longnecker
computed study-specific slopes (linear trends) and 95%
CIs from the natural
logs of the RRs and CIs across
categories of meat intake. The method requires that the
distribution of cases and person-years or non-cases and the
RRs with the variance estimates for at
three
quantitative exposure categories are known. For studies
that did not provide the distribution of cases and person-
years/non-cases, we estimated the slopes using variance-
weighted least squares regression [30]. The median or mean
level of meat consumption in each category of intake was
assigned to the corresponding relative risk for each study.
For studies that reported meat consumption by ranges of
intake we estimated the mean intake in each category by
calculating the average of the natural logarithm of the upper
and lower boundaries, back transformed to non-log scale and
rescaled to g/day [31]. When the highest category was open-
ended we assumed the open-ended interval length to be the
same as the adjacent interval. When the lowest category was
open-ended we set the lower boundary to zero. The average
serving size was set to 120 g for total meat and red meat and
50 g for processed meat [31], equivalent
to a typical
quarterpounder hamburger for total and red meat and one
hot dog or a small sausage for processed meat.

Heterogeneity between studies was assessed by the Q
test and I2 [32]. I2 is the amount of total variation that is
I2 values of
explained by between study variation.
approximately 25%, 50% and 75% are considered to
indicate low, moderate and high heterogeneity, respectively.
We conducted subgroup analyses by duration of follow-up
(<10 years, ≥10 years), number of cases (<500, ≥500,
<1,000, ≥1,000), use of updated or baseline and validated
or non-validated dietary assessment methods and adjust-
ment for confounding factors such as body mass index,

physical activity, energy intake, intake of fibre/cereal fibre
or whole grains, magnesium, smoking and alcohol intake.
We assessed publication bias with the Egger’s test [33] and
the Begg–Mazumdar’s test [34]; the results were considered
to indicate publication bias when p<0.10. To ensure that
the results were not simply due to one large study or a study
with an extreme result, we did a sensitivity analysis
excluding one study at a time to see whether the results
were robust. To assess whether the method of assessment of
diabetes status influenced the results, we conducted
sensitivity analyses according to whether simple self-
report or additional measures were used to identify diabetes
cases and whether a validation study of the diabetes-
assessment method had been conducted. To address the
question of temporality (i.e. whether meat intake was a risk
factor for diabetes or a result of dietary changes following
diabetes diagnosis) we investigated whether the studies
excluded prevalent diabetes cases at baseline, and whether
the results changed if cases diagnosed during early follow-
up were excluded.

Results

We identified 12 cohort studies in the search that could be
included in the analysis (Fig. 1, Table 1). Six of the studies
were from the USA, three from Europe, two from Asia and
one from Australia.

(Fig. 2a), but

Total meat Five cohort studies [15, 17, 21, 23, 26]
investigated the association between total meat intake and
type 2 diabetes risk and included 6,525 cases among
445,323 participants. The summary RR for all studies was
1.17 (95% CI 0.92–1.48)
there was
substantial heterogeneity (I2=86.9%, p<0.0001).
In a
sensitivity analysis we excluded the most
influential
the summary RR ranged from 1.08 (95% CI
studies:
0.86–1.35) when an American study [17] was excluded to
1.31 (95% CI 1.12–1.52) when the Chinese study [21] was
excluded (results not shown). The heterogeneity was partly
explained by the Chinese study [21], and when this study
was excluded there was moderate heterogeneity, (I2=57.3%
and p=0.07). There was no indication of publication bias
with the Begg–Mazumdar’s test, p=0.23, or with Egger’s
test, p=0.64, although these tests were based on only a few
studies.

Dose–response One study with only two categories of total
meat intake was excluded [26], thus four studies [15, 17,
21, 23] were included in the dose–response analysis. The
summary RR per 120 g/day increase in total meat intake
was 1.26 (95% CI 0.84–1.88, Fig. 2b), but
there was

substantial heterogeneity (I2=90.6%, p<0.0001). The het-
erogeneity was partly explained by the Chinese cohort
study [21] and when excluded the three remaining studies
yielded a summary RR of 1.46 (95% CI 1.02–2.08) with
lower, but still high, heterogeneity (I2=68.1%, p=0.04).

Red meat Ten cohort studies [15, 17–22, 24, 25, 27]
investigated the association between red meat intake and
type 2 diabetes risk; these included 12,226 cases among
433,070 participants. The summary RR for high vs low
intake of red meat was 1.21 (95% CI 1.07–1.38) (Fig. 3a).
In the sensitivity analysis the summary RR ranged from
1.19 (1.03–1.36) when an American study [17] was
excluded to 1.26 (95% CI 1.12–1.41) when the Chinese
study [21] was excluded (results not shown). There was
moderate heterogeneity (I2=58.5%, p=0.01, Table 2), but
the Chinese study [21] explained most of the heterogeneity
and when it was excluded the heterogeneity was reduced
(I2=36.7%, p=0.12; result not shown). There was signifi-
cant heterogeneity in several, but not all, subgroups
(Table 2). However,
the heterogeneity in the subgroup
analyses was mainly explained by the Chinese study and
was reduced when this study was excluded (results not
shown). There was no indication of publication bias with
Begg–Mazumdar’s test (p=0.38), or with Egger’s test
(p=0.46).

Dose–response One study that did not quantify red meat
intake was excluded [24], thus nine studies [15, 17–22, 25,
27] were included in the dose–response analysis. The
summary RR per 120 g/day increase in red meat intake
was 1.20 (95% CI 1.04–1.38, Fig. 3b), but there was high
heterogeneity (I2=68.3%, p=0.001).

Processed meat Nine cohort studies [15, 17–23, 27]
investigated the association between processed meat intake
and type 2 diabetes risk and included 9,999 cases among
380,606 participants. The summary RR for high vs low
intake was 1.41 (95% CI 1.25–1.60) (Fig. 4a). In the
sensitivity analysis the summary RR ranged from 1.37
(95% CI 1.20–1.56) when an American study [17] was
excluded to 1.47 (95% CI 1.30–1.65) when the Chinese
study [21] was excluded (results not shown). There was
moderate heterogeneity (I2=53.2%, p=0.03, Table 2), but
the latter study [21] explained most of the heterogeneity
and when excluded we found the heterogeneity was
reduced (I2=36.6%, p=0.14). Heterogeneity was present
in several, but not all, subgroups of studies (Table 2), but
when the Chinese cohort study was excluded the heteroge-
neity in the subgroup analyses was reduced (results not
shown). There was no indication of publication bias with
Begg–Mazumdar’s test (p=0.92), or with Egger’s test
(p=0.69).

slightly higher summary risk estimates (Table 2). The same
was found for processed meat where six studies [15, 17–20,
22] used additional measures to assess type 2 diabetes
status and five studies used a validated method to ascertain
type 2 diabetes status [17–20, 22] (Table 2).

All studies but one used the FFQ to collect dietary intake
data. Excluding the study that used a dietary history method
[27] from the analyses of red and processed meat did not
change the conclusions (the summary RRs were 1.24 [95%
CI 1.08–1.42] and 1.43 [95% CI 1.26–1.64], respectively).
To address the question of temporality we investigated
whether the cohort studies excluded prevalent diabetes
cases at baseline and diabetes cases diagnosed during early
follow-up. All cohort studies except one [26] stated that

Subtypes of red and processed meat Hamburgers, bacon,
hot dogs and other processed meats were also associated
with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes (Table 2), although
these results were based on few studies.

Sensitivity analyses: assessment of type 2 diabetes status,
diet instrument and temporality We excluded two studies
from the analyses of total meat and processed meat that did
not clearly state that the diabetes cases ascertained were of
type 2, but where this could be assumed with a degree of
certainty because of the age range of the participants [23,
26]. This did not change the results (summary RRs for high
vs low intake were 1.13 [95% CI 0.72–1.77] for total meat
and 1.42 [95% CI 1.24–1.63]
for processed meat).
Furthermore, because the studies varied with respect
to
how they ascertained type 2 diabetes cases, we assessed
whether the results varied according to the method of type 2
diabetes ascertainment (i.e. whether simple self-report was
used—defined as answering yes or no to a question of type
2 diabetes diagnosis—or whether additional measures were
used, including supplementary questionnaires that assessed
symptoms, diagnostic tests and treatment or use of medical

positive association between meat
intake and type 2
diabetes could be due to unmeasured or residual confound-
ing or temporal bias. Higher meat intake is often associated
with other unhealthy lifestyles including physical inactivity,
overweight, smoking and unhealthy dietary patterns. How-
ever, most of the studies adjusted for known confounding
factors such as age, BMI, family history of type 2 diabetes,
smoking, physical activity,
total energy intake, alcohol,
menopausal status and use of hormone replacement therapy
(among women) and for other dietary factors. Studies
adjusting for a ‘Western dietary pattern’ also found positive
associations, suggesting that confounding from other risk-
enhancing foods consumed in this dietary pattern does not
explain the adverse effect of meat on the risk of developing
type 2 diabetes [17, 18]. Overweight and obesity are major
risk factors for
type 2 diabetes and a meta-analysis
suggested an approximate 20% increase in type 2 diabetes
risk for each unit increase in BMI [35]. Even though most
of the studies adjusted for BMI, measurement errors due to
self-report of BMI could lead to residual confounding that
potentially could explain the association between meat
intake and type 2 diabetes. However, the studies that relied
on self-report of BMI and validated the anthropometric
measures found that the correlations between self-reported
and measured weight and height were high [23, 36, 37].

Another possible limitation is that these findings could
be due to a temporal bias. High-protein diets have been
promoted for weight
loss by certain groups and in the
media, and it is possible that overweight type 2 diabetes
patients could increase their meat intake to lose weight. If
studies included prevalent type 2 diabetes cases, then these
findings could be due to a temporal bias. All the studies
except one [26] stated that they excluded prevalent cases at
baseline, but none of them excluded cases diagnosed during
early follow-up. A temporal bias would be likely to have
less impact in studies with longer follow-up than in studies
with shorter
follow-up, because the number of cases
diagnosed during early follow-up constitutes a small
fraction of the total number of cases. Restricting the
analysis to studies with longer follow-up (≥10 years) gave
results similar to those obtained in the overall analysis.

The combination of results from several studies increases
the statistical power to detect significant associations due to
increased sample size, but it also results in heterogeneity.
Some heterogeneity is expected as the studies used different
dietary assessment methods, took place in different geo-
graphic locations and included participants who differed by
age, sex and other characteristics. Heterogeneity was
sometimes explained by study characteristics. In general
there was significant heterogeneity in many subgroups, but
because of the limited number of studies in the subgroup
analyses, the results are difficult to interpret. For red and
processed meat, and to some degree total meat, we found

Discussion

In this meta-analysis, intake of red meat, processed meat
and subgroups of meats (hamburger, bacon, hot dogs and
other processed meats) was associated with an increased
risk of type 2 diabetes.

The possible limitations of our meta-analysis must be
taken into consideration. It is possible that the observed

that one study conducted among Chinese women [21]
contributed to the heterogeneity; when this study was
excluded, both the subgroup and the overall analyses
showed much less heterogeneity. The reason for
the
inconsistent results in this study compared with those of
other studies is not clear, but it could be due to a lower
absolute meat intake among the participants than in other
populations [17, 19, 25].

As with any meta-analysis based on published studies,
publication bias is a potential concern. The statistical tests for
publication bias did not suggest the presence of publication
bias in this meta-analysis, although we may have had limited
statistical power in these tests because of the moderate
number of studies. The overall results for red and processed
meat were robust to the influence of single studies, though
the Chinese study most strongly influenced the estimate for
total meat, which was based on fewer studies.

Measurement errors in the exposure variable are known
to bias effect estimates [38], but none of the studies in this
meta-analysis corrected their
results for measurement

errors. Repeated exposure assessments are important
in
cohort studies to reduce misclassification due to dietary
changes during follow-up. In a cohort study the RR of type
2 diabetes was 1.28 for high vs low haem-iron intake (as a
proxy for meat
intake) when using cumulative updated
averages of intake, but with only the baseline questionnaire
the RR was weaker and not significant (RR 1.08) [39]. Four
of the twelve included studies used repeated exposure
assessments. In the case of type 2 diabetes, measurement
errors may not only affect the exposure variable, but also
the outcome due to underreporting of diagnosis in asymp-
tomatic individuals. The summary RRs for the association
between red and processed meat and type 2 diabetes risk
were slightly higher when we restricted the analyses to
studies with validated methods for assessing diabetes status.
Because we only included prospective cohort studies in this
meta-analysis, the measurement errors in both the assess-
ment of exposure and outcome would most likely be non-
differential, and thus give attenuated risk estimates [40].

Several mechanisms may both directly and indirectly
explain an adverse effect of meat intake on type 2 diabetes
risk. Meat is an important source of total and saturated fat
and could increase the risk of type 2 diabetes through
overweight/obesity [41–44], the metabolic syndrome [45–
47] and hyperinsulinaemia and hyperglycaemia [20, 48–
50], although some studies found no association [51, 52].
Another possible mechanism may be through the effects of
haem-iron derived from meat [19, 24, 39, 53]. Iron can
promote oxidative stress by increasing the formation of
hydroxyl radicals [54] which can cause damage to tissues,
in particular the pancreatic beta cells [54]. Elevated iron
status may interfere with glucose metabolism and may
reduce pancreatic insulin synthesis and secretion [55] and
one study suggested a detrimental effect of red meat intake
on glucose metabolism [56]. A number of processed meats
contain nitrites and nitrates which can be converted to
nitrosamines by interaction with amino compounds either
in the stomach or within the food product. Nitrosamines
have been found to be toxic to pancreatic beta cells and to
increase the risk of type 1 and type 2 diabetes in animal
studies [57–59], and of type 1 diabetes in some [60, 61],
but not all [62], epidemiological studies. Other possible
mechanisms may involve advanced glycation end-products
[63], increased levels of inflammatory mediators [13, 47,
64] and γ-glutamyltransferase [65], and lower levels of
adiponectin [66] with high meat intake. Our finding of a
positive association between meat
intake and type 2
diabetes risk is consistent with the 35–50% lower risk
[23] or prevalence [16, 67, 68] of type 2 diabetes among
vegetarians compared with omnivores.

In conclusion we found that high intakes of red meat and
processed meat are risk factors for type 2 diabetes. We
cannot completely rule out
residual

the possibility of

2286

confounding or a temporal bias, but if the association is
real, meat could be added to the list of behavioural factors
which can be modified to decrease type 2 diabetes risk.

Background

A B S T R A C T

While initial dietary management immediately after formal diagnosis is an ’accepted’ cornerstone of treatment of type 2 diabetes
mellitus, a formal and systematic overview of its efﬁcacy and method of delivery is not currently available.

Objectives

To assess the effects of type and frequency of different types of dietary advice for adults with type 2 diabetes.

Search methods

We carried out a comprehensive search of The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, AMED, bibliographies and
contacted relevant experts.

Selection criteria

All randomised controlled trials, of six months or longer, in which dietary advice was the main intervention.

Data collection and analysis

The lead investigator performed all data extraction and quality scoring with duplication being carried out by one of the other six
investigators independently with discrepancies resolved by discussion and consensus. Authors were contacted for missing data.

Main results

Thirty-six articles reporting a total of eighteen trials following 1467 participants were included. Dietary approaches assessed in this
review were low-fat/high-carbohydrate diets, high-fat/low-carbohydrate diets, low-calorie (1000 kcal per day) and very-low-calorie (500
kcal per day) diets and modiﬁed fat diets. Two trials compared the American Diabetes Association exchange diet with a standard reduced
fat diet and ﬁve studies assessed low-fat diets versus moderate fat or low-carbohydrate diets. Two studies assessed the effect of a very-
low-calorie diet versus a low-calorie diet. Six studies compared dietary advice with dietary advice plus exercise and three other studies

assessed dietary advice versus dietary advice plus behavioural approaches. The studies all measured weight and measures of glycaemic
control although not all studies reported these in the articles published. Other outcomes which were measured in these studies included
mortality, blood pressure, serum cholesterol (including LDL and HDL cholesterol), serum triglycerides, maximal exercise capacity and
compliance. The results suggest that adoption of regular exercise is a good way to promote better glycaemic control in type 2 diabetic
patients, however all of these studies were at high risk of bias.

Authors’ conclusions

There are no high quality data on the efﬁcacy of the dietary treatment of type 2 diabetes, however the data available indicate that the
adoption of exercise appears to improve glycated haemoglobin at six and twelve months in people with type 2 diabetes. There is an
urgent need for well-designed studies which examine a range of interventions, at various points during follow-up, although there is a
promising study currently underway.

P L A I N L A N G U A G E S U M M A R Y

Dietary advice for treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus in adults

No high quality data on the efﬁcacy of diet alone exists for treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. This systematic review assesses the
effects of studies that examined dietary advice with or without the addition of exercise or behavioural approaches. Eighteen studies were
included. No data were found on micro- or macrovascular diabetic complications, mortality or quality of life. It is difﬁcult to draw
reliable conclusions from the limited data that are presented in this review, however, the addition of exercise to dietary advice showed
improvement of metabolic control after six- and twelve-month follow-up.

B A C K G R O U N D

Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder resulting from a defect
in insulin secretion, insulin action, or both. A consequence of this
is chronic hyperglycaemia (i.e. elevated levels of plasma glucose)

with disturbances of carbohydrate, fat and protein metabolism.
Long-term complications of diabetes mellitus include retinopa-
thy, nephropathy and neuropathy. The risk of cardiovascular dis-
ease is increased. For a detailed overview of diabetes mellitus,
please see under ’Additional information’ in the information on
the Metabolic and Endocrine Disorders Group on the Cochrane

Library (see ’About the Cochrane Collaboration’, ’Collaborative
Review Groups’). For an explanation of methodological terms, see
the main Glossary on the Cochrane Library. There is now un-
equivocal evidence that type 2 diabetes can be prevented or at least
delayed by dietary effort, generally resulting in weight loss and
increased physical activity in those at high risk of progressing to
diabetes. Risk of such progression was decreased by over half in
the two major trials to date (Tuomilehto 2001; DPP 2002). The
United States Diabetes Prevention Program reported a 58% reduc-
tion in the incidence of diabetes when participants were treated
with the lifestyle intervention compared with a 31% reduction
of incidence of diabetes for the metformin-treated participants,

(DPP 2002). However the role and type of dietary advice follow-
ing diagnosis of type 2 diabetes, how often thereafter and its efﬁ-
cacy during longer-term follow-up over subsequent years is much
less clear. It may be that using different methods of helping people
to learn the principles behind these diets, and different patterns
of support and follow-up, could have effects on long term adher-
ence.

This Cochrane review aims to establish the evidence that exists on
what kind of dietary advice is effective in treating type 2 diabetes.

There are an estimated 2.35m people with diabetes in England,
with up to another 750,000 undiagnosed cases and this is predicted
to grow to more than 2.5m by 2010 (DOH website; Diabetes UK
website).

Type 2 diabetes mellitus is the more common of the two main
types and accounts for between 85 - 95% of all diabetic patients
(Diabetes UK website). In the United Kingdom alone, treatment
of type 2 diabetes costs around £1.8 billion per annum (Moore
2000).

It has been recommended for many years that people diagnosed
with type 2 diabetes should be

treated with diet, and in those overweight to achieve weight loss

and, independently, to lower blood glucose (glycaemia). On aver-
age, there is a 9% relative increase in the risk of type 2 diabetes, for
every 1kg weight gain (Mokdad 2000). Eighty to ninety percent
of type 2 diabetics are obese (BMI >30kg/m2) (Wing 2000) and
obesity worsens the metabolic and physiologic abnormalities asso-
ciated with diabetes, particularly hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia,
and hypertension (Maggio 1997; Wing 2000). Initiation of medi-
cation becomes necessary in addition to diet and exercise when the
latter alone fail to control glycaemia adequately, (Nathan 1999).
While short-term beneﬁts are assumed, attempting to treat type
2 diabetes using diet alone is not a particularly successful long-
term intervention, as illustrated by the United Kingdom Prospec-
tive Diabetes Study, (UKPDS 1998; UKPDS 1998b). This study
showed that after three years of regularly reinforcing dietary advice
in those randomised to the ’diet alone’ arm, only 20% of patients,
and after nine years only 8%, maintained the target fasting plasma
glucose of less than 7.8 mmol/L, (Turner 1999). Part of the un-
certainty in this ﬁeld is whether the dietary and other non-phar-
macological measures actually ’fail’ or whether patients themselves
fail to continue implementing them adequately. Despite this, diet
is usually the ﬁrst treatment implemented on diagnosis of type 2
diabetes and is maintained throughout the addition of other in-
terventions.

Some observational studies have shown that exercise may have an
additional beneﬁt for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, possibly
through lowering body fat and reducing blood pressure (Wallberg-
H. 1998), and several studies have produced some compelling
evidence to show that regular physical exercise can serve to protect
and decrease severity of type 2 diabetes (Frisch 1986; Dowse
1991; Manson 1992a). The review by Thomas et al, 2006, found
that exercise improves blood glucose control and that this effect is
evident even without weight loss (Thomas 2006).

Diets commonly used to control blood glucose levels include low
fat and high unreﬁned carbohydrate, (those which take around
25-30% of energy from fat and around 50% of the total energy
from unreﬁned carbohydrate), or low glycaemic index diets (foods
that have a low glycaemic index include pasta products, oats, beans
and some fruits and vegetables) usually both in combination with
weight reducing advice. Recently, research has also looked into
the effect of individual macro- and micro-nutrients such as ﬁbre,
chromium, and so called ’functional foods’, but much of this ev-
idence seems to be incomplete, with relatively few intervention
trials carried out long-term (Riccardi 2005). Similar diets may be
of value in those with metabolic syndrome in preventing or de-
laying progression to frank diabetes (Riccardi 2000). Given the
prevalence of type 2 diabetes and the potentially serious outcomes
of the disease, it is important to establish which type of diet, either
alone or in combination with other interventions (the addition
of exercise, behavioural approaches and alternative treatments), is
most effective.

This review is a 2007 update of the initial (Moore 2004) review. It
aimed to provide an update of evidence from studies which have
employed a study design which sought to examine the effect of
dietary advice and interventions to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus
in the adult population.

Although no additional included studies were identiﬁed, the re-
view referenced further relevant background research and excluded
studies, and has generated a QUOROM (quality of reporting of
meta-analyses) ﬂow-chart of study selection.

O B J E C T I V E S

The aim of this systematic review was to assess the effects of type
and frequency of dietary advice to all adults (overweight and nor-
mal weight) with type 2 diabetes on morbidity, quality of life, to-
tal mortality, weight and measures of diabetic control, using all
available randomised clinical trials and meta-analytic techniques
where appropriate. The primary objectives were to assess:

a) the effects of different types of dietary advice through weight
change, and development of micro- and macro- vascular compli-
cations in people with type 2 diabetes, and

b) the effects of dietary advice plus other lifestyle interventions
(i.e. the addition of exercise, behavioural approaches and alterna-
tive therapies to dietary advice) through weight change, and de-
velopment of micro- and macro-vascular complications in people
with type 2 diabetes.

Management of hits

We prepared a QUOROM (quality of reporting of meta-analyses)
ﬂow-chart of study selection to describe how we processed the
references identiﬁed through our searches.

The hits identiﬁed from the searches of the electronic databases
[Medline (492), AMED (2), CINAHL (87) , Cochrane Library
(16) and EMBASE (1,110)] were combined (n = 1,707) and de-
duplicated (n = 1,413).

These hit lists were then de-duplicated against the hits of the pre-
vious version of this review. The reduced list of hits was then
screened on titles and abstracts (LN).

All randomised controlled clinical trials of interventions that in-
volved patients for at least six months were included. Randomisa-
tion of individuals or clusters of individuals were accepted.

• weight (where the main aim of the study was weight loss);
• development of micro and macrovascular diabetic

complications (including neuropathies, retinopathy,
nephropathy and cardiovascular diseases).

Types of participants

All studies had to include adult participants (those who were 18
years or older), who were diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. To be
consistent with changes that have occurred over time in the clas-
siﬁcation and diagnostic criteria of type 2 diabetes mellitus, the
diagnosis of diabetes should have been established using the stan-
dard criteria valid at the time of the beginning of the trial. Ideally,
the diagnostic criterion was described in the article. Diagnostic
criteria used included those described by the National Diabetes
Data Group standards (NDDG 1979), the World Health Organ-
isation standards, (WHO 1980; WHO 1985; WHO 1998), and
the American Diabetes Association Standards, (ADA 1997; ADA
1999). Studies performed on participants suffering from impaired
glucose tolerance were not included in this review. Where a study
reported combined results for participants with type 2 diabetes
and participants with impaired glucose tolerance, then efforts were
made to contact the authors of the study to obtain individual pa-
tient data. Where this was unsuccessful, the trial was excluded. In
the protocol for this review we omitted to state how a study look-
ing at a mixture of type 1 and type 2 diabetic participants would
be dealt with. We decided that unless a majority of the participants
(i.e. 90% or more) were classiﬁed as having type 2 diabetes, or the
author of the paper could provide the data for the type 2 diabetic
participants only, the trial was excluded.
Participants could be of either sex, but those who were acutely ill
or pregnant were excluded.

Types of interventions

Studies where the intervention was dietary advice with an aim of
reducing weight and the severity of type 2 diabetes were included
in the review. Dietary advice is taken to mean advice given with the
intention of improving dietary habits (i.e. to either produce weight
loss or to change diet composition). Studies were not included
if they included medication that was provided differently in the
control and intervention groups. Studies evaluating the effects of
ﬁsh oils (omega-3) advice or supplementation on type 2 diabetes
mellitus were excluded as this had previously been addressed in
a recent Cochrane review (Farmer 2001). Studies looking at the
effects of Chinese medical herbs on type 2 diabetes mellitus were
also excluded as these are addressed by another Cochrane review
(Liu 2002).

Types of outcome measures

Primary outcomes

Secondary outcomes

• quality of life (ideally, measured using a validated

instrument);

• change in anti-diabetic medication use (as an indicator of

improving or worsening diabetic control);

• overall cardiovascular disease risk assessment (using any of

the scales which include at least three risk factors);

• mortality;
• glycated haemoglobin;
• serum cholesterol (LDL and/or HDL) and serum

triglycerides;

• maximal exercise capacity (VO2 max);
• blood pressure;
• compliance.

Timing of outcome assessment

Randomised controlled trials of interventions that involved par-
ticipants for a minimum of six months were included in the re-
view. Outcome measures were extracted and assessed at baseline,
six months, one year, two year and at one year intervals from that
point where available.

which reported a total of eighteen studies. In the update, none of
the sixty-eight papers were thought to ﬁt the inclusion criteria, so
no new papers were added. Where full text copies of articles were
retrieved, but then were judged to not meet the inclusion criteria,
the reasons were reported in the excluded studies table.

There were no language restrictions for either searching or trial
inclusion. The search strategy below was used, adapted to suit the
individual databases.
NOTE: Unless otherwise stated, search terms are free text terms;
For details of the search strategy see under Appendix 1.
The MEDLINE search was run as above, with the randomised
controlled trials and systematic reviews searches added on sepa-
rately. The CINAHL search was run as above, with randomised
controlled trials search added on separately.
The AMED search was run as above, with randomised controlled
trials search added on separately.
The EMBASE search was adapted from the original search above.
Once relevant papers were retrieved, their references were analysed
and any relevant referenced papers were also sourced and added
into the review.

Data collection and analysis

Selection of studies

Two reviewers undertook assessment of results data independently.
Results data were assessed by the lead reviewer (LN) and dupli-
cated by one of the co-reviewers (HM, CS, VW, LH, KC and AV).
Information on a number of measures of methodological quality
of the included studies was assessed independently by two review-
ers; study design, method of allocation concealment, blinding of
outcome assessment and drop out rates. Where there was uncer-
tainty, authors were contacted to clarify aspects of study design.
Differences between reviewers’ extraction results were resolved by
discussion. Multiple publications were collated and assessed as one
study.
In the ﬁrst instance, relevant studies were determined from the
initial search of electronic databases, and then through screening
by the lead reviewer (LN). Articles were rejected during this initial
screening if the reviewer could determine from the title and/or
abstract that it did not meet the inclusion criteria, if rejection
was not possible, full text copies were retrieved. For the 2007
update, full text copies of 68 papers were retrieved and assessed
independently by two reviewers (LN plus one other from HM,
CS, VW, LH, KC and AV) using an inclusion/exclusion form.
Inter-rater agreement (using Cohen’s kappa (Cohen 1960)) was
good with all of the reviewers achieving kappa scores of 0.7 or
greater in the ﬁrst review (Moore 2004), Inter-rater agreement of
this review achieved a value of 1.0 (using Cohen’s kappa). Thirty-
six of the original 287 retrieved papers were included in this review,

Data extraction and management

Two reviewers (the lead reviewer (LN) plus one other from HM,
CS, VW, LH, KC and AV) independently extracted data from
each study using a data extraction form based on the one
provided by the Metabolism and Endocrine Disorders Review
Group. Differences between reviewers’ extraction results were re-
solved by discussion, and where necessary, in consultation with a
third reviewer. Data concerning participants, interventions, and
outcomes, as described above in the selection criteria section, were
extracted. Trial quality characteristics, including method of ran-
domisation, allocation concealment, blinding of outcome asses-
sors and losses to follow-up, were extracted onto this form. In ad-
dition, data were collected on potential effect modiﬁers including
age, presence of diabetic micro or macrovascular disease, blood
pressure, lipids, bodyweight, mortality and current use of diabetic
medication.

Assessment of risk of bias in included studies

The quality of each trial was assessed based largely on the quality
criteria speciﬁed by Jadad and Schulz (Schulz 1995; Jadad 1996).
In particular the following factors were assessed:
1. Minimisation of selection bias - score: 0 or 1 or 2.
One point was given if the study could be described as randomized
(which included the use of words such as ’random’, ’randomly’ and
’randomisation’).
One additional point was given if the study described the method
of randomisation and was an appropriate method.
One point was taken away if the study described the method of
randomisation, but was an inappropriate method.
2. Minimisation of detection bias - score: 0 or 1 or 2.
One point was given if the study could be described as blinded (in
any capacity).
One additional point was given if the method of blinding was
described and was appropriate.
One point was taken away if the method was described as blinding
but was inappropriate.
3. Minimisation of attrition bias - score: 0 or 1.
One point was given if the withdrawals and dropouts from the
study were described.
We did not score on performance bias.
Based on these criteria, studies were broadly subdivided into the
following three categories (see Cochrane Handbook):
A - all quality criteria met: low risk of bias. (Studies with scores
of four and ﬁve points (and with at least one point allocated from
each section) were allocated to this category.)

B - one or more of the quality criteria only partly met: moderate
risk of bias. (Studies with scores of three points (and with at least
one point in each section) were allocated to this category.)
C - one or more criteria not met: high risk of bias. (Studies with
scores of zero, one, two and three points were allocated to this
category. (i.e. studies with no points in at least one section))
These subdivisions of the studies were not used as the basis of a
sensitivity analysis, as the included studies received similar quality
scores, (between one and three points). These quality scores and
categories are reported in the ’characteristics of included studies’
table.

Measures of treatment effect

Continuous data

Endpoint versus change data: Where possible, endpoint data were
presented, as change standard deviations were not available for
many studies. If both endpoint and change data were available for
the same outcomes, only the former were reported in this review.
If endpoint data were not available, but change data were, we
reported the change data in the tables and text of the review.
However, for inclusion of a study reporting change data in the
meta-analysis, we calculated the endpoint mean from the change
data given and assumed that the endpoint standard deviation to
be equal to the baseline standard deviation.

Summary statistic

For continuous outcomes a weighted mean difference (WMD)
between groups was estimated.

Assessment of heterogeneity

We tested for heterogeneity by using the standard chi2 test and the
I2 test (Higgins 2002), as well as by visually inspecting the graphs,
and when there was little heterogeneity between trial results,
data were summarised statistically by a ﬁxed effect model for con-
tinuous data. A signiﬁcance level less than 0.10 was interpreted
as evidence of heterogeneity. If heterogeneity was found, the data
were re-analysed using a random effects model to see if this made
a substantial difference.

Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity

Subgroup analyses were planned a priori but were not undertaken
as they were not applicable to the included studies. These sub-
group analyses were planned to assess whether particular groups of
people with type 2 diabetes could obtain more beneﬁt from a par-
ticular intervention than other groups could. Efﬁcacy of different

combinations of types of diets would have also been considered
in the subgroup analyses. The main analyses carried out were as
follows:

• dietary advice versus different dietary advice;
• dietary advice versus same dietary advice plus exercise;
• dietary advice versus same dietary advice plus behavioural

approaches.

Analyses for dietary advice versus same dietary advice plus alterna-
tive therapies and for dietary advice versus the same dietary advice
delivered at a different frequency were planned, but as no studies
were found these analyses could not be carried out.
Subgroup analyses for each of these comparisons would have in-
cluded:
with or without weight loss advice (outcome measures: develop-
ment of (further) microvascular disease only) presence/absence of
microvascular disease (outcome measures: development of
(further) microvascular disease only).

Sensitivity analysis

No sensitivity analyses were performed.

Description of studies

Trials identiﬁed

From the initial searches of electronic databases, 8675 (775 from
the Cochrane Library, 4278 from MEDLINE, 3310 from EM-
BASE, 269 from CINAHL and 43 from AMED) abstracts were
screened after de-duplication (HM). For this update review, 1413
articles were screened (16 from the Cochrane Library, 492 from
MEDLINE, 1110 from EMBASE, 87 from CINAHL and 2 from
AMED) (Figure 1). Articles were rejected on initial screening if
the reviewer could determine from the title and/or abstract that it
did not meet the inclusion criteria. For the 2007 update review,
full text copies of 66 papers were retrieved and assessed indepen-
dently by two reviewers (LN plus one other from HM, CS, LH,
KC, VW and AV), none of which were eligible for inclusion in the
study. However, 36 of the original 287 papers, which reported 18
studies, were included in this review. All articles for which hard
copies were retrieved but which failed to meet the inclusion criteria
were reported in the excluded studies table. Attempts were made
to obtain full-text translations and/or evaluations of all relevant
non-English articles.

Interrater agreement

Full text copies of 68 papers were retrieved and assessed indepen-
dently by two reviewers (LN plus one other from HM, CS, LH,
KC, VW and AV) using an inclusion/exclusion form. Interrater
agreement (using Cohen’s kappa (Cohen 1960)) was good with all
of the reviewers achieving kappa scores of 0.7 or greater.

Missing data

All authors were contacted by the lead reviewer in the event of data
which has been reported as recorded but not reported in the text
of published articles. Replies were received from Dr Hockaday,
(Hockaday 1986), Dr Wolever, (Tsihlias 2000), and Dr Samaras,
(Samaras 1997).

Included studies

Eighteen studies met the inclusion criteria. Nine studies focused
on looking at the effects of two types of diabetic dietary advice that
did not differ in intent to lose weight, (de Bont 1981; Hockaday
1986; Gallagher 1987; Campbell 1990; Wing 1991; Milne 1994;
Wing 1994; Pascale 1995; Tsihlias 2000), three studies focused
on looking at dietary advice versus dietary advice plus behavioural
approaches, (Glasgow 1997; Glasgow 2000; Keyserling 2000), and
six studies concentrated on dietary advice versus dietary advice
plus exercise, (Kaplan 1986; Wing 1988; Uusitupa 1996; Agurs-
Collins 1997; Ligtenberg 1997; Samaras 1997).
Of the nine studies that compared two types of diabetic diet that
did not differ in intent to lose weight, four took place in the United
States of America, (Gallagher 1987; Pascale 1995; Wing 1991;
Wing 1994), two were based in the United Kingdom, (de Bont
1981 and Hockaday 1986), one in Canada, (Tsihlias 2000), one in
New Zealand, (Milne 1994) and one study was based in Australia,
(Campbell 1990).
There were three studies that assessed dietary advice versus dietary
advice plus behavioural approaches; all of these were conducted
in the United States, (Glasgow 1997; Glasgow 2000; Keyserling
2000).
From a total of six dietary advice versus dietary advice plus exercise
studies, one took place in Finland, (Uusitupa 1996), one in The
Netherlands, (Ligtenberg 1997), one study was conducted in Aus-
tralia, (Samaras 1997), and three took place in the United States
of America, (Kaplan 1986; Wing 1988; Agurs-Collins 1997).

Studies

Wide ranges of dietary approaches were examined in this review.
Within the studies that compared two types of diabetic dietary
advice that did not differ in intent to lose weight, there were three

distinct groups; those studies that used exchange diets versus those
that did not use exchange diets, (Gallagher 1987; Campbell 1990),
those studies that used low-fat versus moderate fat or low-carbohy-
drate diets, (de Bont 1981; Hockaday 1986; Milne 1994; Pascale
1995; Tsihlias 2000), or very-low-calorie diets versus low-calorie
diets, (Wing 1991; Wing 1994).
From the studies that assessed dietary advice versus dietary advice
plus exercise, it was seen that the types of exercise examined in the
studies that are contributing to the review included various forms
of aerobic exercise, (in general participants chose their exercise
from suggestions that included walking, jogging, swimming, ball
games or skiing).
There were similar interventions included within the group-
ing for dietary advice versus dietary advice plus behavioural ap-
proaches. Generally, the mode of imparting the dietary advice was
what was changed in these interventions; either through a touch-
screen method, (Glasgow 1997), or through community resources,
(Glasgow 2000; Keyserling 2000).

Participants

Thirty-six articles reporting a total of eighteen trials following
1467 participants were included. There were 724 participants in
the control groups, and 743 participants in the intervention groups
included in this review. The samples used in the trials were gener-
ally representative of the overall diabetic population. Diagnostic
criteria for the trials in this review included physician conﬁrmed
diabetic status, type 2 diabetes classiﬁed according to the National
Diabetes Data Group, (NDDG 1979), and diabetes mellitus as
deﬁned by the World Health Organisation, (WHO 1985). Gen-
erally, the diagnostic criteria were not disclosed in the articles.

Interventions

The participants in the trial run by Campbell, (Campbell 1990),
were randomised to one of two groups, to a typical portion ex-
change diet or to a reduced fat (focusing on reducing fat) diet.
de Bont conducted a trial of a low-fat diet versus a low-carbohy-
drate diet, (de Bont 1981). The Gallagher study, (Gallagher 1987),
evaluated the usual American Diabetic Association exchange diet
(40% carbohydrate, 40% fat and 20% protein) compared to a re-
duced fat diet, which was based upon the four basic food groups,
(see Results section for more details). Hockaday conducted a trial
where participants were randomised to either a low-carbohydrate
or a low-fat diet, (Hockaday 1986). Milne randomised the par-
ticipants into groups that either followed a low-carbohydrate or
a low-fat diet, (Milne 1994). Pascale described a trial that ran-
domised the participants to follow either a calorie restricted diet
or a calorie restricted and low-fat diet (less than 20% of energy to

come from fat), (Pascale 1995). The participants in the Tsihlias
trial, (Tsihlias 2000), were randomised to receive either a low-fat
or a monounsaturated fat diet.
The participants in the trial described by Wing were randomised
to either a balanced low-calorie diet (1000-1200 kcal per day) or
a balanced low-calorie diet with two periods of twelve weeks of
a very-low-calorie diet (of 400-500 kcal per day), (Wing 1994).
Another trial by Wing, (Wing 1991), randomised the participants
to either a low-calorie yet balanced diet (with a calorie goal of
~1000 to 1500 kcal per day) or to a low-calorie (balanced) diet
with a period of very-low-calorie diet (~500 kcal per day) added
for eight weeks.
The study conducted by Agurs-Collins randomised participants
to either a ’usual care’ group or a ’usual diet with exercise’ group,
(Agurs-Collins 1997). In the study conducted by Uusitupa and
colleagues, (Uusitupa 1996), participants were randomised to ei-
ther a standard dietary treatment group or a diet and exercise
group. The trial by Ligtenberg randomised the participants to ei-
ther continue with their usual diet or to receive their usual diet
plus physical training instructions, (Ligtenberg 1997). Samaras
randomly assigned participants to receive either their usual diet or
to receive their usual diet plus a structured exercise programme,
(Samaras 1997). The participants in the Kaplan, (Kaplan 1986),
trial were randomly allocated to either weekly sessions of diet ed-
ucation, which focused on promoting a low-fat (30% of total en-
ergy), high carbohydrate (55% of total energy) or to weekly ses-
sions of diet and exercise education. Wing conducted a trial which
randomised participants to either a diet only group or a diet plus
exercise group, (Wing 1988).
Glasgow conducted a trial that randomised the participants to ei-
ther receive usual care or usual care plus the brief intervention
added in, (Glasgow 1997). Another trial by Glasgow, (Glasgow
2000), randomly assigned its participants to receive either a basic
intervention (received information about low-fat eating) or the
community resources intervention. The trial conducted by Key-
serling randomised the participants to receive either a clinic-based
intervention or a clinic-based intervention plus community inter-
vention, (Keyserling 2000).

Outcome measures

The primary outcomes that we intended to assess in this review
were:

• weight;
• development of micro and macrovascular diabetic

complications (including neuropathies, retinopathy,
nephropathy and cardiovascular diseases).

Weight was generally well reported, whereas development of micro
and macrovascular diabetic complications was only reported in
one trial, (Hockaday 1986), and even here, this was only a brief
description.
The secondary outcome measures that we intended to look at were:

1. Quality of life (ideally, measured using a validated instrument),
2. Change in anti-diabetic medication use (as an indicator of im-
proving or worsening diabetic control),
3. Overall cardiovascular disease risk assessment (using any of the
scales which include at least three risk factors),
4. Mortality,
5. Glycated haemoglobin,
6. Serum cholesterol (LDL and/or HDL) and serum triglycerides,
7. Maximal exercise capacity (VO2 max),
8. Blood pressure,
9. Compliance.
These additional outcome measures were reported with varying
degrees of comprehensiveness. Measures of quality of life and car-
diovascular disease risk assessment were not reported in any stud-
ies. Change in anti-diabetic medication and maximal exercise ca-
pacity were measured and reported in a few trials, although they
used different outcome measures. Mortality was brieﬂy reported in
a few trials (de Bont 1981; Milne 1994) although details of cause
of death were not often disclosed. Serum cholesterol and triglyc-
erides and blood pressure were reported in some trials, although
generally only the means (and not their associated standard devi-
ations or standard errors) were reported. Glycated haemoglobin
was recorded by nearly all trials and compliance was recorded by
some trials, usually in the form of three day food diaries, and al-
though generally not reported in any way, a few studies did report
that ’compliance was generally good’ (Kaplan 1986; Wing 1988;
Samaras 1997).

Risk of bias in included studies

Further details of the methodological quality of the included stud-
ies can be found in the table of characteristics of included studies.

Minimisation of selection bias

Since randomisation was the ﬁrst inclusion criterion that studies
had to meet, all included studies started with a score of 1. Only two
articles described the method of randomisation used, (Hockaday
1986; Glasgow 1997) and therefore were awarded another quality
point. Where studies described the method of randomisation, it
was appropriate.

Minimisation of detection bias

One point was assigned for the presence of assessor blinding in
only one trial, (de Bont 1981). None of the included articles made
any attempt to describe the method of blinding. In dietary trials,
it is not possible to blind participants or the study personnel to
the intervention or advice they receive (or are imparting).

Minimisation of attrition bias

More than half of the studies had withdrawals that were not fully
described. However, there were seven studies that did describe the
drop-outs and withdrawals to an acceptable degree, (de Bont 1981;
Hockaday 1986; Wing 1988; Wing 1991; Milne 1994; Pascale
1995; Keyserling 2000) and these studies all received a point to add
to their quality scores. Eleven studies reported follow-up data of
more than 80% of the baseline sample, (de Bont 1981; Hockaday
1986; Wing 1988; Campbell 1990; Wing 1991; Milne 1994;
Pascale 1995; Ligtenberg 1997; Samaras 1997; Glasgow 2000;
Keyserling 2000). A number of studies reported higher drop-out
rates; 30% at twelve months (Pascale 1995), 32% at six months
(Tsihlias 2000), 40% at six months and 44% at twelve months
(Keyserling 2000). The study reported by Hockaday (Hockaday
1986) assessed subsections of the initial study population, so anal-
ysis of attrition bias was not appropriate. Two other studies did
not describe attrition at all (Gallagher 1987; Glasgow 1997).

Allocation concealment

Allocation concealment to intervention or control was unclear
in all but one, (Hockaday 1986), of the eighteen studies. In the
published article, allocation concealment was unclear, but as a
result of a personal communication from Dr Hockaday, this was
then revised to ’adequate’.
The source of funding for more than half of the included studies
(12 out of 18) was stated in the published papers. Generally, the
funding came from national sources so conﬂicts of interests were
avoided (i.e. operators/providers of treatment/intervention) were
not paying for the study to be carried out.
Seventeen studies, (Hockaday 1986; Kaplan 1986; Gallagher
1987; Wing 1988; Campbell 1990; Wing 1991; Milne 1994;
Wing 1994; Pascale 1995; Uusitupa 1996; Agurs-Collins 1997;
Glasgow 1997; Ligtenberg 1997; Samaras 1997; Glasgow 2000;
Keyserling 2000; Tsihlias 2000), were judged to be at high risk of
bias; one study, (de Bont 1981), was judged to be at medium risk
of bias and no studies were judged to be at a low risk of bias.

Effects of interventions

All of the primary publications for the included studies were in-
dexed by both MEDLINE and the Cochrane Central Register
of Controlled Trials. Five of the primary references were indexed
within CINAHL and twelve of the primary publications were in-
dexed within EMBASE. None of the primary references of trials
included in this review were indexed by AMED.

Heterogeneity

Three tests for heterogeneity were applied for the data in compar-
ison 3 (Dietary Advice versus Dietary Advice plus Physical Activ-
ity). These were for

• Comparison 3.02: Weight at twelve months

• Comparison 3.03: Glycated haemoglobin at six months
• Comparison 3.04: Glycated haemoglobin at twelve months

A ﬁxed effects model was used to analyse these data. Signiﬁcant
heterogeneity was found within the studies included in category
3.02 (I2 value of 56.8%, a chi2 value of 4.63 with 2 degrees of
freedom and a P-value of 0.10, (when analysed using a random
effects model, these values remained the same)). Although in usual
circumstances we would take this P-value to be an indicator of
signiﬁcance, we believe that this meta-analysis may have been af-
fected by the large difference between the endpoint data for the
two groups in the Samaras trial, (Samaras 1997). Although the
participants in this trial were randomly allocated to one of two
groups, at baseline the mean weight of the control group was 15kg
more than the intervention group, and therefore when we looked
at endpoint data, even though the participants in both groups had
actually gained a small amount of weight, there was still a large dif-
ference between the control, (mean weight at twelve months was
99.0kg) and intervention groups, (mean weight at twelve months
was 83.1kg), which suggested that the intervention was particu-
larly successful, when indeed this could not be concluded from the
change data provided. The studies included within category 3.03
were not heterogeneous (I2 value of 34.1% and a P-value of 0.21),
and showed a statistically signiﬁcant change in glycated haemo-
globin in favour of the addition of exercise to dietary advice. The
studies included within category 3.04 were not heterogeneous (I2
value of 0% and chi2 value of 0.16 with 2 degrees of freedom and
had a P-value of 0.92) and showed a statistically signiﬁcant change
in glycated haemoglobin in favour of the addition of exercise to
dietary advice.

Effects of the interventions

Comparison 01: Two types of diabetic dietary advice that did

not differ in intent to lose weight

Nine studies assessed two types of diabetic dietary advice that did
not differ in intent to lose weight (dietary advice versus another
form of dietary advice).
Campbell randomised 70 participants to one of two groups, usual
diet or a reduced fat diet, (Campbell 1990). Usual diet was a typical
portion exchange diet where caloric restriction was discussed. The
intervention diet focused only on reducing fat. Change in weight
was not reported in the paper using kilograms but through Body
Mass Index. Body Mass Index decreased in the intervention group
from 30.4 ± 4.8kg/m2 at baseline to 29.6 ± 4.6kg/m2 at six months
compared to 32.0 ± 5.5kg/m2 at baseline to 31.1 ± 5.1kg/m2 at
the six month follow-up. Glycated haemoglobin was not reported
in the paper.
de Bont conducted a trial of a low-fat diet versus a low-carbohy-
drate diet, (de Bont 1981). One hundred and forty eight type 2 di-
abetic participants were randomised and 136 were followed up six

months later. The primary outcome of the study was body weight,
although this was reported separately for obese and non-obese par-
ticipants. Weight in the obese participants decreased from 84.2kg
at baseline to 81.5kg at six months, and in the non-obese partic-
ipants weight decreased from 60.1kg to 59.7kg, which represents
a decrease of 2.7kg for the obese participants and of 0.4kg for the
non-obese participants in the low-fat diet. This was compared to
the group following the low-carbohydrate diet where the subset
of obese participants went from a baseline weight of 84.8kg to
83.9kg at six months, which was a decrease of 0.9kg; the non-
obese participants began the trial with a mean weight of 59.0kg
which by the end of six months had risen to 59.1kg, a rise of 0.1kg.
Glycated haemoglobin was reported for all participants, and at
baseline was 10.0% and decreased to 9.3% in the low-fat diet
group at six months, whereas glycated haemoglobin was 10.1% at
baseline and decreased to 9.5% in the low-carbohydrate group at
six months. (Although mean changes were reported, the associated
standard deviations/errors were not.)
The papers describing the Gallagher study, (Gallagher 1987), eval-
uated the American Diabetic Association exchange diet (40% car-
bohydrate, 40% fat and 20% protein) compared to a reduced fat
diet, which was based upon the four basic food groups (which
are: 1) fruits and vegetables, 2) whole grains, cereals, and bread,
3) dairy products, 4) meats, ﬁsh, poultry, eggs, dried beans, and
nuts). Fifty-one male type 2 diabetic participants were randomised
to one of the two groups. Weight and glycated haemoglobin was
measured but not reported in the published articles. Attempts at
personal communication with the authors proved to be unsuccess-
ful.
Hockaday conducted a trial of 250 diabetic participants who
were randomised to either a low-carbohydrate or a low-fat diet,
(Hockaday 1986). However only subgroups of this trial have been
reported in press. In the Hockaday study, the biggest subgroup of
the trial was reported which was made up of 93 participants; 39
participants in the low-carbohydrate group and 54 participants
in the low-fat group. Between baseline and one year, participants
in the low-carbohydrate group had a mean weight loss of 3.8kg
compared to a mean weight loss of 4.6kg in the low-fat diet group.
(Although mean weight change was reported, the associated stan-
dard deviations/errors were not.) Changes in glycated haemoglo-
bin were measured but not reported, although ’changes in glycated
haemoglobin were not signiﬁcant’.
Milne randomised 44 participants into either a low-carbohydrate
or a low-fat diet, (Milne 1994). At baseline, participants had a
mean weight of 83.1 ± 16.9kg and 80.8 ± 7.8kg for the low-
carbohydrate and the low-fat diet groups respectively. At follow-
up six months later, mean weight of the low-carbohydrate group
had decreased to 82.1 ± 15.0kg (a decrease of 1.0kg) and the low-
fat group mean weight had decreased to 80.7 ± 7.8kg (a decrease
of 0.1kg). At the 18 month follow-up the mean weight of the
low-carbohydrate group had remained stable at 82.1 ± 15.0kg and
the low-fat group mean weight had also remained stable at 80.7

± 13.8kg. Glycated haemoglobin decreased in the low-fat group
from a baseline value of 9.8 ± 3.1% to 9.5 ± 2.6% at six months
and then rose to 9.7 ± 2.6% at 18 months (an overall decrease
of 0.1%) and a decrease in the low-carbohydrate group from a
baseline measurement of 8.7 ± 2.3% to 8.5 ± 2.0% at six months
and then remained stable at 8.5 ± 2% at the 18 month follow-up
(an overall decrease of 0.2%).
Pascale described a trial that randomised 44 participants to follow
either a calorie restricted diet (1000-1500 kcal per day) or a calorie
restricted and low-fat diet (1000-1500 kcal per day, but less than
20% of energy to come from fat), (Pascale 1995). Thirty-one par-
ticipants were followed up (16 in the calorie restricted group and
15 in the calorie restricted and low-fat diet group) one year from
baseline. Participants in the calorie restricted diet group decreased
their mean weight one year later by 0.96 ± 3.7kg from a baseline
measurement of 93.1 ± 13.0kg, compared to the calorie restricted
and low-fat diet who decreased their mean weight one year later
by 5.2 ± 7.3kg from the baseline measurement of 94.4 ± 9.5kg.
At the twelve month follow-up, glycated haemoglobin levels rose
in the calorie restricted diet group by 0.2 ± 1.7% (from 10.9%
± 2.7% at baseline). In contrast, at twelve months in the calorie
restricted and low-fat diet group, the mean glycated haemoglobin
levels remained the same (10.4 ± 1.9% at baseline with a change
of 0.0 ± 1.9% at the one year follow-up).
In the study reported by Tsihlias, (Tsihlias 2000), 61 participants
were randomised to receive either the low-fat (high-carbohydrate)
or the monounsaturated fat diet; six months later 41 participants
were followed up. The participants in the monounsaturated fat
diet had an overall weight gain of 0.1kg over the six month period
(from 78.8 ± 12.5kg at baseline to 78.9 ± 13.0kg at six months),
compared with the participants in the low-fat diet group who lost
an overall weight of 1.2kg over the six month period (from 77.4
± 14.7kg at baseline to 76.2 ± 13.8kg at six months). There were
’no signiﬁcant changes in glycaemic control’ during the study pe-
riod. Glycated haemoglobin data were obtained through a per-
sonal communication from Dr Wolever, and at baseline the mo-
nounsaturated fat diet group had a measurement of 7.7 ± 1.1%,
which rose to 8.1 ± 1.5% at follow-up six months later. The par-
ticipants in the low-fat (high carbohydrate) diet group at baseline
had a blood glycated haemoglobin concentration of 8.1 ± 1.2%,
which rose to 8.3 ± 1.5% at the six months follow-up.
As mentioned previously, there are three distinct groups that the
above studies can be assigned to, (two groups are assessed here, the
third (very-low-calorie diets versus low-calorie diets) is discussed
in the next section). Clinical similarity, the decision to pool or
not, study quality and an overview of the primary and secondary
results will be discussed for each.

(a) Studies that assessed exchange diets versus not using an
exchange diet

In both of these two studies, (Gallagher 1987; Campbell 1990),

the American Diabetes Association exchange diet was compared
with a standard reduced fat diet. The two trials recruited similar
participants, (the only difference being that the Gallagher trial
recruited solely male participants and the Campbell trial had mixed
participation). The quality of the these two studies were assessed to
be at high risk of being biased. Weight change was measured in the
Gallagher study, where 9% of the intervention group lost weight
compared to 25% of the control group losing weight, although no
hard data were reported. Development of micro and macrovascular
diabetic complications were not reported. Body Mass Index (as a
measure of weight) was reported in the Campbell study, and the
intervention group lost an average 0.8kg/m2 compared to 0.9kg/
m2. Both studies measured, but did not report change in glycated
haemoglobin.
These studies were clinically similar to permit pooling, but with
only two studies in this category, pooling of the data was not
possible. There were a total of 121 participants in this comparison
grouping, where the quality of the trials was judged to be at high
risk of being biased. No ﬁrm conclusions could be drawn from
this comparison.

(b) Studies that assessed low-fat diets versus moderate fat or
low-carbohydrate diets

In these ﬁve studies, (de Bont 1981; Hockaday 1986; Milne 1994;
Pascale 1995; Tsihlias 2000), a low-fat diet was compared with
either a moderate fat or a low-carbohydrate (although not nec-
essarily mutually exclusive) diet. The trials recruited similar par-
ticipants (with regards to age and sex). The quality of the trials
were assessed, and ﬁve out of the six trials were assessed to be at
a high risk of bias, and the other trial was assessed at a moderate
risk of bias. Weight change was measured in all of the studies and
in general more weight was lost in those groups that were follow-
ing a low-fat diet. Development of micro and macrovascular dia-
betic complications were reported in one trial, (Hockaday 1986),
although not in great detail, and these outcome measures were
not reported in the other ﬁve trials. Glycated haemoglobin was
reported, but there were only marginal changes in the trials, so no
ﬁrm conclusions could be drawn from this.
All of these studies were clinically similar enough to permit pool-
ing, but there were only two studies at six months which had data
that could be pooled, (two of the other trials reported means with-
out their associated standard deviations, (de Bont 1981; Hockaday
1986)), and one reported change data, (Pascale 1995) therefore it
was not possible to look at the statistical heterogeneity in this com-
parison. There were a total of 378 participants in this comparison
grouping, where generally the quality of the trials was judged to
be at high risk of being biased. Conclusions could not be drawn
from this comparison.

Comparison 02: very-low-calorie Dietary Advice versus

Another Form of Dietary Advice

Two studies assessed very-low-calorie dietary advice versus another
form of dietary advice (low-calorie diet).
Wing described a study in which 93 participants were randomised
to either a balanced low-calorie diet (1000-1200 kcal per day) or
a balanced low-calorie diet with two periods of twelve weeks of
a very-low-calorie diet (of 400-500 kcal per day), (Wing 1994).
Glycated haemoglobin was reported at 6 and 12 months, whereas
weight was only reported at 12 months. Glycated haemoglobin for
the low-calorie diet group was 10.5 ± 2.0% at baseline, decreasing
to 8.8 ± 1.8% at six months, which rose to 9.2 ± 2.0% at twelve
months and then rose again to 10.7 ± 2.4% at twenty-four months,
compared to 10.4 ± 2.0% at baseline, a decrease to 8.4 ± 2.2% at
six months, and then a slight rise to 8.9 ± 2.5% at twelve months
and a greater rise to 10.4 ± 2.2% at twenty-four months for the
very-low-calorie diet group. Mean body weight for the low-calorie
diet group at baseline was 107.7 ± 18.7kg, which rose to 118.2
± 11.6kg at twelve months, whereas participants in the very-low-
calorie diet group had a mean baseline weight of 105.8 ± 19.4kg,
which decreased to 91.6 ± 10.3kg at twelve months.
Wing randomised 36 people to either a low-calorie yet balanced
diet (with a calorie goal of ~1000 to 1500 kcal per day) or to a low-
calorie (balanced) diet with a period of very-low-calorie diet (~500
kcal per day) added for eight weeks, (Wing 1991). At baseline,
the low-calorie group had a mean weight of 104.5 ± 21.5kg and
at follow-up twelve months later their mean weight had dropped
to 97.7 ± 17.4kg, compared with the very-low-calorie diet group
who at baseline had a mean weight of 102.1 ± 11.7kg and twelve
months later had a mean weight of 93.5 ± 10.4kg. Both groups lost
a signiﬁcant amount of weight and weight loss was not improved
by use of a very-low-calorie diet. Glycated haemoglobin was 10.4
± 2.0% at baseline, which rose to 11.8 ± 2.7% at twelve months
for the low-calorie group compared with a baseline glycated hae-
moglobin concentration of 10.4 ± 2.2%, which decreased to 9.2
± 2.1% at the twelve month follow-up for the very-low-calorie
group. The changes in glycated haemoglobin were statistically sig-
niﬁcant in both groups.
Both studies, (Wing 1991; Wing 1994), assessed the effects of a
very-low-calorie diet against the effects of a low-calorie diet. The
quality of these trials was judged to be at high risk of bias. Weight
change was measured and reported and more weight was lost in
the very-low-calorie diet groups at twelve months, although in the
ﬁrst trial, (Wing 1994), at twenty four months more weight loss
was recorded in the low-calorie diet group. Development of micro
and macrovascular complications were not reported in these stud-
ies. Glycated haemoglobin was recorded and reported, at twelve
months there was a greater decrease in glycated haemoglobin in
the very-low-calorie dietary advice group, compared with the very-
low-calorie dietary advice group, however there was very little
change from baseline to twenty-four months in either group.
The two studies were clinically similar enough to permit pooling,
but as there were only two studies, it was not statistically possi-
ble to carry out an analysis on the heterogeneity of the data. One

hundred and twenty-nine participants took part in these two tri-
als and overall the trial quality was assessed to be at high risk of
bias. The evidence suggests that longer term (twenty-four months)
weight loss and glycaemic control is best achieved by low-calorie
dietary advice, compared with the very-low-calorie dietary advice,
although once again, the high potential for bias should be consid-
ered, and no ﬁrm conclusions could be drawn from this data.

Comparison 03: Dietary Advice versus Dietary Advice plus

Exercise

Six studies compared interventions that examined the effect of
dietary advice alone or dietary advice plus exercise on participants
with type 2 diabetes.
Agurs-Collins randomised 64 participants to either a ’usual care’
group or a ’usual diet with exercise’ group, (Agurs-Collins 1997).
Published details of the usual care control were brief; participants
in this group attended a class that discussed methods of glycaemic
control and they also received two mailings of nutrition informa-
tion. Participants in the intervention arm (the diet plus exercise
group) were advised to adhere to a diet that had ~55% of kcal
from carbohydrate, 20% from protein and less than 30% from
fat. The exercise component consisted of a ﬁve minute warm up,
20 minutes of low-impact aerobic activity and 5 minutes of cool-
down exercises and was carried out three times a week. Partici-
pants were also encouraged to exercise on their own twice more
per week. At the end of the trial period, (i.e. six months later)
participants in the usual care group had gained a mean weight of
2.0kg, (from 94.9 ± 20.1kg at baseline to 96.9 ± 21.6kg at the six
month follow-up) compared to the participants in the diet plus
exercise group who lost a mean weight of 2.6kg (from a baseline
measurement of 93.3 ± 18.6kg to the six month follow-up value
of 90.7 ± 20.1kg). Concentration of glycated haemoglobin in the
usual care group rose over the six month period from a mean of
10.0 ± 1.9% to 11.5 ± 4.4%, compared to the diet plus exercise
group whose mean glycated haemoglobin concentration decreased
from 11.0 ± 1.7% to 9.9 ± 2.0% over the six month period.
In the study conducted by Uusitupa and colleagues, (Uusitupa
1996), 86 participants were randomised to either a standard di-
etary treatment group or a diet and exercise group. Standard di-
etary treatment consisted of reduced energy intake with emphasis
on reducing intake of total fat and cholesterol. In the diet only
group the mean weight changed from 92.2 ± 14.7kg at baseline to
a measurement of 90.2 ± 14.3kg at the follow-up appointment at
twelve months (which equates to a loss of 2.0 ± 11.4kg), compared
to a weight change of 91.6 ± 14.5kg at baseline to a measurement
of 86.5 ± 13.7kg at follow-up at twelve months (a loss of 5.1 ±
11.1kg) in the diet plus exercise group. Over the twelve months
between baseline and follow-up, blood concentration of glycated
haemoglobin decreased by 0.3 ± 1.5% in the diet only group (from
7.8 ± 2.0% at baseline to 7.5 ± 1.7% at twelve months) and by
0.5 ± 1.3% in the diet plus exercise group, (from 7.1 ± 1.8% at

baseline to 6.6 ± 1.6% at twelve months).
Ligtenberg describes a study that randomised 58 participants to
either continue with their usual diet or to receive physical training
instructions for six weeks and then to continue training (with
encouragement) at home for a following six weeks with a further
fourteen weeks non-encouraged exercise at home, (Ligtenberg
1997). Weight was measured for both groups at the start and the
endpoint of the trial, although no data were reported in the article,
but the authors did state ’body weight did not change in either
group during the whole study period’. Glycated haemoglobin was
measured and reported at baseline and follow-up. In the diet only
group, glycated haemoglobin rose by 0.2 ± 1.2% from baseline
to follow-up at six months (from 8.8 ± 1.5% to 9.0 ± 1.6%)
compared to a decrease of 0.2 ± 0.8% from baseline to follow-up
for participants in the diet plus exercise group at six months (from
8.9 ± 1.0% to 8.7 ± 1.1%).
Samaras randomly assigned 26 non-exercising participants to re-
ceive either their usual diet or to receive their usual diet plus a
structured exercise programme that ran for one hour, once a month
for six months, (Samaras 1997). This was a moderately paced aer-
obic exercise session run by an exercise physiologist. This paper re-
ported baseline and change data. Baseline measurement of weight
for the diet only group was 98.2 ± 12.3kg which rose by 1.0 ± 2.9kg
after six months and then rose (compared to the baseline measure-
ment) at the twelve month follow-up by 0.8 ± 3.9kg compared to
the diet plus exercise group where the baseline measurement was
83.0 ± 13.0kg, which decreased by 0.1 ± 2.7kg at the six month
follow-up and then rose (compared to the baseline measurement)
by 0.1 ± 3.9kg at the twelve month follow-up. Glycated haemo-
globin concentrations in both groups of participants rose over the
six month period of the trial, by 0.6 ± 0.9% in the control group
(from 6.8 ± 2.2% at baseline) and by 0.1 ± 1.1% in the diet and
exercise group (from 5.6 ± 1.1% at baseline). Measures of glycated
haemoglobin also rose from baseline to the twelve month follow-
up in both control and intervention groups, rising by 0.9 ± 1.0%
in the diet only group (from 6.8 ± 2.2% at baseline) and by 0.9 ±
1.0% in the diet and exercise group (from 5.6 ± 1.1% at baseline).
In Kaplan’s trial, (Kaplan 1986), 76 participants were randomly
allocated to either ten weekly sessions of diet education, which
focused on promoting a low-fat (30% of total energy), high carbo-
hydrate (55% of total energy) or to ten weekly sessions of diet and
exercise education. Five of these weekly sessions were spent on diet
education (as for the control group) and the following ﬁve were
spent on supervised exercise in an adult ﬁtness programme that
included stretching and walking/jogging. Some data on weight
change were measured and reported in the text of the article; the
mean weight loss over six months for the diet only group was
3.5kg compared to a loss of 0.2kg for the diet plus exercise group
from baseline to six months. (Although mean weight change was
reported, the associated standard deviations/errors were not.) Gly-
cated haemoglobin was measured but not reported except to say
that there was ’no signiﬁcant difference between the groups at

baseline and six month follow up’.
Wing conducted a trial that had 30 participants randomised to
either a diet only group or a diet plus exercise group, (Wing
1988). The diet only group had an individualised daily calorie
goal and participants were taught to try and increase their complex
carbohydrate intake and to decrease their intake of fat. Participants
in the diet plus exercise group had the same dietary advice imparted
but also walked for three miles a day three times a week and were
instructed to exercise (on their own) for another session per week.
At the twelve month follow-up, participants in the diet only group
had lost a mean weight of 3.8 ± 15.4kg (from 102 ± 19.4kg to 98.2
± 20.0kg) compared to a mean weight loss of 7.9 ± 18.3kg in the
diet and exercise group at twelve months (from 104.1 ± 23.2kg
to 96.2 ± 23.4kg). Glycated haemoglobin decreased in a similar
fashion, in the diet only group, the concentration decreased by 0.8
± 1.4% from baseline to follow-up at twelve months, (from 10.9
± 1.9% to 10.1 ± 1.6%), compared to a decrease of 1.4 ± 1.5%
in the diet plus exercise group (from 10.6 ± 1.9% to 9.2 ± 1.8%)
over the same time period.
In these six studies, (Kaplan 1986; Wing 1988; Uusitupa 1996;
Agurs-Collins 1997; Ligtenberg 1997; Samaras 1997), dietary ad-
vice was compared with dietary advice plus exercise. The trials re-
cruited participants with similar characteristics (age and sex) and
the quality of the trials were assessed to be at high risk of bias.
Weight change was assessed in all trials, although not reported in
two trials, (Ligtenberg 1997 and Kaplan 1986), and more weight
was lost on average in the diet and exercise groups. The devel-
opment of micro and macrovascular diabetic complications were
not reported. Glycated haemoglobin was reported in most trials
and decreased more in the participants in the dietary advice and
exercise groups than those in the dietary advice only groups.
The six studies were clinically similar enough to permit pool-
ing, (although the participants in the Samaras intervention group
(Samaras 1997) were generally less heavy than the participants in
the other trials in this category) and as there were three or more
studies (with data that could be entered into the tables) in all but
one category, (weight at six months), it was statistically possible to
carry out an analysis on the heterogeneity of the data. For weight at
twelve months the ﬁxed effect model test for heterogeneity was sig-
niﬁcant. The test for heterogeneity was not signiﬁcant for change
in glycated haemoglobin at six and twelve months. At six months,
dietary advice plus exercise was associated with a statistically sig-
niﬁcant mean (pooled weighted mean difference) decrease in gly-
cated haemoglobin of 0.9% (with 95% conﬁdence intervals of 0.4
to 1.3), and at twelve months, dietary advice plus exercise was
associated with a statistically signiﬁcant mean (pooled weighted
mean difference) decrease in glycated haemoglobin of 1.0% (with
95% conﬁdence intervals of 0.4 to 1.5). Three hundred and forty
participants took part in these trials and overall the trial quality
was assessed to be at high risk of bias. The evidence suggests that
dietary advice plus exercise has the potential to have an impact on
weight and glycaemic control, although the high potential for bias

should be considered when interpreting the evidence.

Comparison 04: Dietary Advice versus Dietary Advice plus

Behavioural Approaches

Three studies assessed dietary advice versus dietary advice plus
behavioural approaches.
Glasgow conducted a trial that evaluated the efﬁcacy of a per-
sonalised medical ofﬁce-based intervention, (Glasgow 1997). Two
hundred and six participants in this study were randomised to
either receive usual care or usual care plus the brief intervention
added in. All participants went half an hour early to their physician
appointment and completed the baseline assessment, which in-
cluded a touch screen assessment. Usual care participants received
a high quality quarterly medical care intervention including regu-
lar assessment and follow-up of micro and macrovascular risk fac-
tors in addition to the touch screen computer assessment, although
there was no focus on behavioural or psychosocial issues. The par-
ticipants randomised to the ’brief ’ intervention group completed
another ﬁve to ten minute touch screen dietary barriers assessment
which immediately generated two printed feedback forms (one
for the participant and one for the physician). No results were
available in the articles, and attempts at personal communication
proved to be unsuccessful.
Glasgow randomly assigned 160 participants to receive either
the basic intervention or the community resources intervention,
(Glasgow 2000). Participants assigned to the basic intervention
group received information about low-fat eating. Participants as-
signed to the community resources group received the same in-
formation about low-fat eating as the basic group but in addition
they had access to ’community resources’ which was comprised of
three-ring binder of indexed community resources, four newslet-
ters identifying opportunities for participants to obtain support, a
food frequency was mailed and tailored feedback was sent with ad-
vice to decrease intake of dietary fat. The participants in the com-
munity resources group decreased their mean weight from 96.2
± 22.2kg at baseline to a follow-up value of 95.3 ± 20.9kg at six
months, compared to the participants in the basic care group who
decreased their mean weight from 90.3 ± 16.3kg at baseline to a
follow-up value of 89.4 ± 16.8kg at six months. The concentra-
tion of glycated haemoglobin remained stable in the community
resources group (a value of 7.3 ± 1.5% at baseline to a value of
7.3 ± 1.4% at the six month follow-up) compared with the basic
intervention group who decreased their mean glycated haemoglo-
bin from 7.6 ± 1.2% at baseline to 7.4 ± 1.2% at the six month
follow-up.
Keyserling describes a trial that had 133 participants randomised
to receive a clinic-based intervention or a clinic-based intervention
plus community intervention, (Keyserling 2000). All participants
were given a single loose-leaf notebook from which assessment and
monitoring pages could be removed and ﬁled. The clinic-based
intervention consisted of four individual visits to a counsellor (ses-

sions lasting for 195 minutes in total) where counsellors would
negotiate with the participant on the selection of two or three goals
from each assessment area within the provided notebook. The ad-
ditional community intervention included phone calls to partici-
pants and also three group sessions (two sessions between zero and
six months and one between six and twelve months of the trial
duration) which speciﬁcally addressed issues relating to cultural
translation. Measurements were made at baseline, six and twelve
months. In the clinic-based arm of the study, mean weight de-
creased from a baseline of 92.5 ± 22.1kg to 91.6 ± 21.7kg at the six
month follow-up (a weight loss of by 0.9kg). Weight then increased
by 1.9kg (92.5 ± 22.1kg at baseline to 94.4 ± 23.2kg) at the twelve
month follow-up. In the clinic and community resources group,
the mean weight remained the same from baseline measurement
(93.9 ± 19.3kg) to six months (96.2 ± 19.3kg) and then increased
by 2.3kg from baseline (93.9 ± 19.3kg) to the twelve month fol-
low-up measurement (96.2 ± 19.3kg). In the clinic-based group,
concentration of glycated haemoglobin increased from a baseline
measurement of 11.0 ± 3.2% to the six month follow-up value
of 11.1 ± 3.1%; from baseline measurement to the twelve month
follow-up, there was a decrease from 11.0 ± 3.2% (baseline) to
10.9 ± 3.8% (twelve month follow-up). In comparison, concen-
tration of glycated haemoglobin in participants in the clinic-based
and community resources arm of the study remained stable at the
six month follow-up (baseline measurement of 10.7 ± 2.3% com-
pared to a six-month measurement of 10.7 ± 3.1%). At the twelve
month follow-up, the glycated haemoglobin had risen from 10.7
± 2.3% to 10.8 ± 2.9%.
In the three studies, (Glasgow 1997; Glasgow 2000; Keyserling
2000), dietary advice was compared with dietary advice plus a be-
havioural approach. The trials recruited participants with similar
characteristics (age and sex) and the quality of the trials were as-
sessed to be at high risk of bias. Weight change was assessed in all
trials, although not reported at all in one of the trials, (Glasgow
1997), and although more weight was lost on average in the usual
care (dietary advice only) groups, the amount of weight lost was
not substantial. The development of micro and macrovascular di-
abetic complications was not reported in any of the studies. Gly-
cated haemoglobin was reported in all but one trial, (Glasgow
1997), and generally more improvement in glycaemic control was
seen in the usual care groups, although once more the changes
were not signiﬁcant.
Although the three studies were clinically similar enough to permit
pooling; data were only available for two of these studies, therefore
it was not possible for an analysis for heterogeneity to be carried
out. There were a total of 499 participants in these three trials and
overall the trial quality was assessed to be at high risk of bias. Firm
conclusions could not be drawn from this comparison.

Summary of main results

This systematic review assessed eighteen randomised controlled
trials of dietary advice studying a total of 1467 participants with
type 2 diabetes mellitus. Only a minority of the trials examined
hard clinical endpoints (such as death or development of macrovas-
cular or microvascular diabetic complications), and those that did
offered no details; most articles concerned themselves with the re-
porting and discussion of the participants’ weight and blood glu-
cose control.
Meta-analyses could not be carried out for the data within the
dietary advice versus another (different) form of dietary advice,
the very-low-calorie dietary advice versus low-calorie dietary ad-
vice category and the dietary advice versus dietary advice plus be-
havioural approaches categories, as there were not sufﬁcient data
to allow this.
Within the dietary advice versus dietary advice plus exercise cat-
egory, there were small, yet signiﬁcant changes seen in mean gly-
cated haemoglobin at six months and twelve months in the four
(Uusitupa 1996; Agurs-Collins 1997; Ligtenberg 1997; Samaras
1997) and three studies (Wing 1988; Uusitupa 1996; Samaras
1997) that contributed data to these analyses. At six months, di-
etary advice plus exercise was associated with a statistically signiﬁ-
cant mean (pooled weighted mean difference) decrease in glycated
haemoglobin of 0.9% (with 95% conﬁdence intervals of 0.4 to
1.3), and at twelve months, dietary advice plus exercise was asso-
ciated with a statistically signiﬁcant mean (pooled weighted mean
difference) decrease in glycated haemoglobin of 1.0% (with 95%
conﬁdence intervals of 0.4 to 1.5).
A recent systematic review published in the Cochrane Library by
Pirozzo, (Pirozzo 2002), suggested that there was no real differ-
ence between a low-fat diet and other weight reducing diets (when
looking at long term weight loss) in overweight or obese people.
The reviewers found that generally there were small, non-signiﬁ-
cant differences in weight loss between the participants in the con-
trol and intervention groups, however this difference was so small
it was clinically insigniﬁcant. In this review, there were insufﬁcient
data to permit a meta-analysis, so conclusions on the effects of low-
fat or other weight reducing diets were limited. However, clinically
meaningful differences in glucose proﬁle were not achieved.
Recently, some small-scale studies discussed the importance of di-
etary composition and low-carbohydrate diets in the management
of type 2 diabetes mellitus (Boden 2005; Nielsen 2005). Low car-
bohydrate diets appeared to have a signiﬁcant effect on decreasing
HbA1c and weight reduction. However, more research is required
on larger populations and with a strict control group.
This update review yielded no further studies which ﬁt the cri-
teria for inclusion and exclusion, and thus, no further trials have
been added to the meta-analyses. However, one study by Ash (Ash
2003), investigated the effectiveness of three isocaloric dietary in-
tervention groups (intermittent energy restriction, pre-portioned
meals, and self-selected meals) for a duration of 12 weeks, with a
follow-up after 18 months. Despite this study being a randomised

control trial, of male adults with type 2 diabetes, it was excluded
from any further analyses due to a dubious control arm to the study.
However, the study concluded that a moderate energy restriction
of 1400-1700kcal/day was effective in achieving a 6% weight loss
and an improvement in glycaemic control. The method of imple-
mentation was found to be insigniﬁcant, whilst the weekly contact
with health care professionals was suggested as the facilitator of
the successful outcomes.
This review is relevant to physicians treating patients with type 2
diabetes, the results suggest that the addition of exercise alongside
a reduced energy diet is the best way to promote better glycaemic
control in type 2 diabetic patients, with this achieving consistent
success in the trials reported in this review. We found no signiﬁcant
results in relation to weight.
In terms of the relevance of this review to future researchers, it is
important to use these ﬁndings as a basis from which to generate
hypotheses. As this review is high quality, we believe it can form
a ﬁrm foundation for research project proposals and identifying
gaps in areas of further research.

Limitations of the review

Diabetes mellitus is a major and growing health problem, and it has
been predicted that the number of people with diabetes will double
over the next 10 years (WHO/FAO 2003). The adoption of a
more afﬂuent and westernised lifestyle (i.e. a lifestyle where energy
consumed is not matched or exceeded by energy expended) by
some non-Western populations is also contributing to an increase
in the diabetic population (Roman 1997). For all diabetic patients,
achieving good glycaemic control is central to their well-being.
Eighty to ninety percent of type 2 diabetic patients are overweight.
With a decrease in weight, an improvement in glycaemic control
is often observed.
There were not enough data in the studies that assessed one dietary
advice versus another (different) type of dietary advice to enable
us to reach any satisfactory conclusions. The data included in the
trials in this review which assessed dietary advice plus behavioural
approaches did not have the data to allow us to reach any satisfac-
tory substantial conclusions. The studies which examined dietary
advice versus dietary advice plus physical activity do suggest ben-
eﬁt from adoption of increasing physical activity levels alongside
a reduced energy diet. We found no randomised controlled trials
that examined dietary advice versus dietary advice plus alternative
therapies.
Despite the frequency and severity of this condition, there are
comparatively few trials and participants which have studied the
impact of dietary advice and interventions. This may be partly due
to type 2 diabetes being diagnosed relatively late by which time islet
cell decompensation is reasonably advanced. As a consequence,
even impressive degrees of weight loss can result in a rise rather
than a fall in glycated haemoglobin. This is not an indication that
the dietary intervention has failed but that the patient requires an

oral anti-diabetic agent.
There is a need for far more research into effects of dietary change
(with and without the addition of physical activity) on micro and
macrovascular diabetic complications, weight and glycaemic con-
trol. Many of the outcomes we initially wished to look at in this
review were not investigated in the included studies. Work carried
out in the future should take care to record and publish mortality,
change (or delay) in onset of anti-diabetic medication and also
quality of life as these are outcomes of importance to people with
type 2 diabetes. It would be desirable if measures of compliance
would also be recorded and reported in published works.
The new long term study (known as ’look AHEAD’ (Action for
Health in Diabetes, (Kelley 2002)) sponsored by the National
Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA, began in 2002
and aims to look at the long-term health effects of weight loss in
men and women who are overweight and have type 2 diabetes
who are 45 to 75 years of age. It is envisaged that participants
will be assessed up to eleven and a half years after enrolling in the
programme, which will reveal the long-term health effects of the
trial.
Long-term, high-quality research in this area is necessary as the
increase of type 2 diabetes is currently mirroring the recent rise
of obesity that has been concerning health care professionals for
the last ten years. Diabetes has now reached epidemic proportions
and further immediate work is required in an attempt to halt it.

Implications for practice

Using exercise as an adjunct to dietary advice, compared with di-
etary advice alone, appears to improve glycated haemoglobin at
six and twelve months in people with type 2 diabetes. There were
small, yet signiﬁcant changes in glycated haemoglobin in the four
(Uusitupa 1996; Agurs-Collins 1997; Ligtenberg 1997; Samaras
1997) and three (Wing 1988; Uusitupa 1996; Samaras 1997) stud-
ies that contributed data to these analyses. Dietary advice plus ex-
ercise was associated with a statistically signiﬁcant mean (pooled
weighted mean difference) decrease in glycated haemoglobin of
0.9% (with 95% conﬁdence intervals of 0.4 to 1.3) at six months
and of 1.0% (with 95% conﬁdence intervals of 0.4 to 1.5) at twelve
months (it should be noted that there is insufﬁcient evidence to
suggest what the effects of the dietary advice would be on weight
or diabetic micro- and macrovascular diseases).

Implications for research

The current available evidence assembled in this review points
towards the beneﬁt of increasing exercise in people with type 2
diabetes. Further high quality research to examine the addition
of exercise alongside a reduced energy diet would be of great im-
portance to either corroborate or contradict these ﬁndings. High

quality research is needed to identify what types (low-fat/high-
carbohydrate diet, modiﬁed-fat diet, restricted protein diet etc.),
frequency and style (addition of behaviour modiﬁcation or not)
of dietary advice are most efﬁcacious in the long-term for use by
people with type 2 diabetes.

Conclusions

There are no high quality data on the efﬁcacy of the dietary treat-
ment of type 2 diabetes programmes, however the data we do have
indicate that the adoption of exercise appears to improve glycated
haemoglobin at twelve months in people with type 2 diabetes, al-
though the data presented are at high risk of bias. There is a need
for well-designed studies which examine a range of interventions,
although there is a promising study currently underway.

This review has also highlighted the lack of outcome studies of
effects of dietary change on micro- and macrovascular diabetic
complications. Many of the outcomes we wished to look at were
not investigated in the included studies and therefore we recom-
mend that any research carried out in the future should take care
to note and report mortality, change (or delay) in onset of anti-
diabetic medication and also quality of life as these are outcomes
of importance to people with type 2 diabetes. Measures of com-
pliance should also be recorded and reported in published works.

acids:saturated fatty acids ratio of ~0.9). 20% of energy should come from protein and carbohydrate
should provide 50% of total energy. Cholesterol was restricted to a maximum of 2.1grams per week. The
advice to participants was given once only at the time of diagnosis
Comparison intervention(s):
Standard low-carbohydrate diet. The advice given to participants was to restrict carbohydrate up to a
maximum of 40% of total energy. Protein should provide up to 20% and fat to provide about 40% (with
a ratio of polyunsaturated fatty acids:saturated fatty acids of ~0.3) The advice to participants was given

goals from each assessment area to accomplish before the next visit. The goal sheet was designed so it could
be placed on the refrigerator where it would be seen frequently. The community intervention included
phone calls to participants and group sessions. Alongside the four individual meetings IG participants
had during the ﬁrst six months, participants also had two group sessions of 90 minutes each and monthly

In the control (clinic) arm of the study, mean weight decreased from a baseline of 92.5 ± 22.1kg to 91.6
± 21.7kg at the six month follow-up (a weight loss of by 0.9kg). Weight then increased by 1.9kg (92.5 ±
22.1kg at baseline to 94.4 ± 23.2kg) at the twelve month follow-up.
In the intervention (clinic and community resources) group, the mean weight remained the same from
baseline measurement (93.9 ± 19.3kg) to six months (96.2 ± 19.3kg) and then increased by 2.3kg from
baseline (93.9 ± 19.3kg) to the twelve month follow-up measurement (96.2 ± 19.3kg)
Concentration of glycated haemoglobin increased in the clinic-based group, from a baseline measurement

Trial intervention(s):
Participants followed their usual diet plus the Exercise Support Group Programme, which was conducted
at the local leisure centre run by the local council. Staff involved included a nurse educator, exercise
physiologist, dietitian, group facilitator and physician. Monthly sessions were of an hour with the group
facilitator and one other team member dealing with various issues including safe exercise, exercise speciﬁc
education to improve conﬁdence, coping with diabetes and exercise and self-esteem issues. A moderately
paced aerobic exercise group session followed with emphasis placed on exercising up to 50% of VO2max.
The intervention phase lasted for six months, with the exercise sessions remaining available to intervention
group participants after this time
Comparison intervention(s):
Participants followed their usual diet, but received no additional encouragement to exercise beyond that
which was routinely given at clinic appointments. The participants made visits to the clinic at baseline,
six and twelve months for assessment

Participants in the diet only group had a baseline weight of 98.2 ± 12.3kg which rose by 1.0 ± 2.9kg after
six months and then rose (compared to the baseline measurement) at the twelve month follow-up by 0.8

Trial intervention(s):
After a common three month basic education programme, the intensiﬁed treatment participants were
treated at the outpatient clinic. They visited it six times over the year (at two month intervals) where
they were seen by a physician, dietitian and a nurse. Participants received printed and oral instructions
for effective exercise training. Physical activity was measured by daily exercise records. The diet was
implemented through individually planned energy-restriction
Comparison intervention(s):
After a common three month basic education programme, the conventional “standard” treatment par-
ticipants were treated at community health centres (that had originally referred the patients to the trial)
for twelve months. They were advised to visit the health centres at two monthly intervals. Participants
received basic information regarding the potential beneﬁts of physical activity and also dietary instructions
on how to reduce intake of total fat, total energy and dietary cholesterol

Mean weight for the participants in the diet only group changed from 92.2 ± 14.7kg at baseline to a
measurement of 90.2 ± 14.3kg at the twelve month follow-up.
Mean weight change for the participants in the diet plus exercise group was from 91.6 ± 14.5kg at baseline
to a measurement of 86.5 ± 13.7kg at the twelve month follow-up
Over the twelve months between baseline and follow-up, the mean blood concentration of glycated
haemoglobin decreased by 0.3 ± 1.5% in the diet only group (from 7.8 ± 2% at baseline to 7.5 ± 1.7%

rose to 118.2 ± 11.6kg at twelve months.
Participants in the very low calorie diet group had a mean baseline weight of 105.8 ± 19.4kg, which
decreased to 91.6 ± 10.3kg at twelve months
Glycated haemoglobin for the low calorie diet group was 10.5 ± 2.0% at baseline, decreasing to 8.8 ± 1.
8% at six months, which rose to 9.2 ± 2.0% at twelve months and then rose again to 10.7 ± 2.4% at
twenty-four months
Glycated haemoglobin in the very low calorie diet group, was measured at 10.4 ± 2.0% at baseline,
decreased to 8.4 ± 2.2% at six months, and then slightly rose to 8.9 ± 2.5% at twelve months and a greater
rise to 10.4 ± 2.2% at twenty-four months for the very low calorie diet group

Interventions

Trial design:
RCT
Randomisation procedure:
“...randomly assigned..”
No further detail given.
Allocation concealment:
Unclear
Blinding:
Recipients: No
Providers of Care: No
Outcome Assessors: Unclear
Quality Assessment Category: C (one point awarded) - high risk of bias

Country: USA
Setting: Out-patient clinic
Number: 93 participants in total were randomised (48 to IG and 45 to CG) at the start of the trial.
At six months: No data reported.
At one year: 38 participants in IG and 41 participants in CG were followed up.
At two years: 36 participants in IG and 37 participants in CG were followed up
Age:
At baseline:
IG: 52.3 ± 10.7 years
CG: 51.3 ± 8.7 years
Sex:
At baseline:
CG: 38% male; 62% female.
IG: 33% male; 67% female.
Diagnostic criteria:
1. All participants must meet NDDG criteria for type 2 diabetes mellitus
Inclusion criteria:
1. More than 30% or 18kg above their ideal body weight (based on Metropolitan Life Insurance norms).
2. Aged 30 to 70 years.
3. No health problems that would preclude use of a VCLD.

Trial intervention(s):
Low calorie diet (LCD) with two x twelve week periods of very low calorie diet (VCLD). Participants were
prescribed a diet of 400 to 500 kcalories per day for two periods of twelve weeks (weeks 1 to 12 and weeks
24 to 36) interspersed with a low calorie diet (LCD: 1000 to 1200 kcalories per day as in the control diet)
. During the VLCD period of the study, participants could either consume up to 500 kcalories per day in
liquid formula or from lean meat or ﬁsh. The LCD was slowly reintroduced after the VCLD period had
ﬁnished, slowly increasing the calories over four weeks
Comparison intervention(s):
Low calorie diet of 1000 to 1200 kcalories per day. Participants were able to select the food items they
wished but they were encouraged to spread their calories over the day and to limit dietary fat to less than
30% of calories

Outcomes

The low calorie group had a baseline mean weight of 104.5 ± 21.5kg and a follow-up mean weight of 97.
7 ± 17.4kg twelve months later.
The very low calorie diet group had a baseline mean weight of 102.1 ± 11.7kg and twelve months later
had a mean weight of 93.5 ± 10.4kg

Notes

Risk of bias

The mean blood concentration of glycated haemoglobin in the low calorie group was 10.4 ± 2.0% at
baseline, and 11.8 ± 2.7% at follow-up twelve months later.
The mean glycated haemoglobin concentration in the participants of the very low calorie group was 10.
4 ± 2.2% at baseline and 9.2 ± 2.1% at the twelve month follow-up
1. Weight
2. Glycaemic control
3. Blood pressure
4. Lipids
were all measured at six, twelve and twenty-four months.

Source of funding of trial: None mentioned
A deposit of US$150 per participant was required at the start of the study, but was refunded in full for
reaching behavioural goals and attending assessment sessions
Drop-outs:
At one year, ten participants from the IG and four from the CG had dropped out.
At two years, twelve participants from the IG and eight from the CG had dropped out

Description

23 May 2007 New search has been performed No new studies have been added.

The bulk of the background remains the same but some new references have been
included and some sections reworded.
The main thrust of the review remains the same.
No changes have been made to the methodology. The search strategies used were
the same, and the dates over which the databases were searched were simply
updated.
The results have not changed since the ﬁrst publication as there were no further
studies added.
The discussion has been amended slightly, with the discussion of a few more
recent studies added (e.g. Ash 2003).
The conclusions remain the same - more high quality evidence for the treatment
of type 2 diabetes mellitus using dietary advice are required before further con-
clusions can be made

Coffee consumption and risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus
Rob M van Dam, Edith J M Feskens 
Coffee is a major source of caffeine, which has been shown to
acutely  reduce  sensitivity  to  insulin,  but  also  has  potentially
beneficial effects. We prospectively investigated the association
between coffee consumption and risk of clinical type 2 diabetes
in  a  population-based  cohort  of  17 111  Dutch  men  and  women
aged  30–60  years.  During  125 774  person  years  of  follow-up,
306  new  cases  of  type  2  diabetes  were  reported.  After
adjustment  for  potential  confounders,  individuals  who  drank  at
least seven cups of coffee a day were 0·50 (95% CI 0·35–0·72,
p=0·0002) times as likely as those who drank two cups or fewer
a  day  to  develop  type  2  diabetes.  Coffee  consumption  was
associated  with  a  substantially  lower  risk  of  clinical  type  2
diabetes.

Lancet 2002; 360: 1477–78
Coffee is a major source of caffeine and chlorogenic acid,1 and
contains  substantial  amounts  of  magnesium  and  other
micronutrients. Results of metabolic studies have shown that
caffeine acutely decreases sensitivity to insulin,2 but tolerance
of  caffeine  could  develop.2 The  phenol  chlorogenic  acid
reduces glucose absorption and oxidative stress in vitro,1 and
inhibits hydrolysis of glucose-6-phosphate, which could reduce
glucose output in the liver.3 Magnesium intake could improve
insulin sensitivity and secretion, and has been associated with 
a  lower  risk  of  type  2  diabetes.4 No  studies  of  coffee
consumption and risk of type 2 diabetes have been reported.
We  therefore  aimed  to  assess  prospectively  the  association
between coffee consumption and risk of type 2 diabetes.

We  randomly  selected  men  and  women  from  the  civil
registries  of  Doetinchem  and  Maastricht,  Netherlands.
Baseline measures were obtained as part of monitoring projects
by questionnaires and a physical examination. All participants
gave  written  informed  consent  and  approval  was  obtained
from the local ethics committee. In Doetinchem, we obtained
baseline  information  between  1987  and  1991  and  follow-up
information  between  1993  and  2000;  and  in  Maastricht,
baseline  information  was  obtained  between  1987  and  1997

and follow-up information in 1998. The response rate for the
follow-up  questionnaire  was  77%  in  Maastricht  and  80%  in
Doetinchem.  We  excluded  participants  if  they  were  younger
than 30 years (n=3586), had reported being pregnant (n=182)
or having diabetes mellitus (n=223) at baseline, or had missing
information  (n=478).  After  exclusions,  the  study  population
comprised 17 111 individuals aged 30–60 years.

We used a self-administered questionnaire to assess usual
diet  including  coffee  consumption  (“How  many  cups  of
coffee do you usually drink per day?”). In a validation study
(subsample  n=203),  mean  coffee  consumption  was  0·9
cups/day  lower  for  this  questionnaire  compared  with  the
dietary  history  method  (Spearman  correlation  0·80).  We
used  a  follow-up  questionnaire  to  assess  presence  of
diabetes, age of diagnosis, use of drugs for diabetes, and use
of insulin injections. Diabetes with insulin treatment started
within  6  months  after  diagnosis  was  not  included  as  an
endpoint,  since  such  treatment  could  indicate  presence  of
type  1  diabetes.  We  used  Cox’s  proportional-hazards
analysis to calculate relative risks.

Participants drank a mean of 5·2 (SD 2·9) cups of coffee a
day. Higher coffee consumption was associated with male sex,
a  low  educational  level,  a  higher  body-mass  index,  cigarette
smoking,  alcohol  use,  less  leisure  time  physical  activity, 
and  a  generally  less  favourable  diet  (table  1  and  webtable  at
http://image.thelancet.com/extras/02let3012webtable.pdf).
In 125 774 person-years of follow-up, 306 new cases of type
2  diabetes  were  reported.  Higher  coffee  consumption  was
associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes (table 2). This
inverse  association  remained  after  adjustment  for  potential
confounders (relative risk 0·50 [95% CI 0·35–0·72] for ⭓7
versus ⭐2  cups/day).  Furthermore,  risk  of  type  2  diabetes
decreased  with  higher  coffee  consumption  in  a  graded
manner,  and  we  also  recorded  an  inverse  association  when
coffee  consumption  was  modelled  as  a  continuous  variable
(0·77  [0·63–0·94]  per  5  cups/day).  Consumption  of  tea
(mean 1·8 cups/day, SD 2·1) was lower than that of coffee,

[95% CI 0·70–1·36] for ⭓3 versus 0 cups/day, adjusted for
coffee intake). Consumption of decaffeinated coffee was too
low to study separately (median 1·0 cup/day, range 0·5–3·0
in the 30% that consumed it). Results remained essentially
the same when we adjusted for tea and food intake, excluded
users of decaffeinated coffee, excluded persons without any
coffee consumption, excluded the first 4 years of follow-up,
only studied patients who used antidiabetic drugs, or studied
all patients with diabetes (including n=27 with probable type
1  diabetes)  as  an  endpoint  (relative  risks  ranged  from
0·69–0·79 per 5 cups/day). The inverse association between
coffee  consumption  and  risk  of  diabetes  was  consistently
recorded  in  all  subgroups  divided  according  to  risk  factors
(results not shown).

Our study could be limited by selective non-response, but
baseline  coffee  consumption  was  similar  in  persons  with

the  relative  risk  estimates  if  the  likelihood  of  diabetes

association  we  recorded  between  coffee  and  diabetes
probably did not result from an effect of diabetes symptoms
on  coffee  since  results  were  similar  after  exclusion  of  the 
first  4  years  of  follow-up.  Residual  confounding  could 
have  affected  the  results.  However,  the  observation  that 
high  coffee  consumption  was  associated  with  mostly
unfavourable  lifestyle  and  dietary  factors,  makes  it  less
plausible that our finding was due to incomplete adjustment
for these factors.

Treatment of active Crohn’s disease
with recombinant human
granulocyte-macrophage colony-
stimulating factor
Brian K Dieckgraefe, Joshua R Korzenik 

Treatment  for  Crohn’s  disease  is  aimed  at  immunosuppression.
Yet inherited disorders associated with defective innate immunity
often  lead  to  development  of  a  Crohn’s-like  disease.  We
performed  an  open-label  dose-escalation  trial  (4–8  ␮g/kg  per
day) to investigate the safety and possible benefit of granulocyte-
macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in the treatment
of  15  patients  with  moderate  to  severe  Crohn’s  disease.  No
patients  had  worsening  of  their  disease.  Adverse  events  were
negligible  and  included  minor  injection  site  reactions  and  bone
pain.  Patients  had  a  significant  decrease  in  mean  Crohn’s
disease activity index (CDAI) score during treatment (p<0·0001).
After 8 weeks of treatment, mean CDAI had fallen by 190 points.
Overall,  12  patients  had  a  decrease  in  CDAI  of  more  than  100
points,  and  eight  achieved  clinical  remission.  Retreatment  was
effective, and treatment was associated with increased quality-
of-life measures. GM-CSF may offer an alternative to traditional
immunosuppression in treatment of Crohn’s disease.

ABSTRACT
ObjeCtives
To examine the prospective associations between 
consumption of sugar sweetened beverages, 
artificially sweetened beverages, and fruit juice with 
type 2 diabetes before and after adjustment for 
adiposity, and to estimate the population attributable 
fraction for type 2 diabetes from consumption of sugar 
sweetened beverages in the United States and United 
Kingdom.
Design

attributable fraction was estimated in national surveys 
in the USA, 2009-10 (n=4729 representing 189.1 
million adults without diabetes) and the UK, 2008-12 
(n=1932 representing 44.7 million).

WhAT IS AlReAdy knoWn on ThIS TopIC
Current evidence is limited to answer whether or not consumption of sugar 
sweetened beverages, artificially sweetened beverages, and fruit juice is 
associated with risk of diabetes after adjustment for obesity status
Despite in the debate of a policy intervention to reduce consumption of sugar 
sweetened beverages, no study has estimated how many incident cases of diabetes 
may be caused by consuming sugar sweetened beverages
WhAT ThIS STudy AddS
Habitual consumption of sugar sweetened beverages was positively associated 
with incidence of type 2 diabetes, independently of obesity status
Under an assumption of causality, consumption of sugar sweetened beverages may 
be linked to 4-13% of type 2 diabetes incidence in the United States and 2-6% in the 
United Kingdom over 10 years, 2010-20

diabetes, by 18% per one serving/day (95% 
confidence interval 9% to 28%, I2 for 
heterogeneity=89%) and 13% (6% to 21%, I2=79%) 
before and after adjustment for adiposity; for 
artificially sweetened beverages, 25% (18% to 33%, 
I2=70%) and 8% (2% to 15%, I2=64%); and for fruit 
juice, 5% (−1% to 11%, I2=58%) and 7% (1% to 14%, 
I2=51%). Potential sources of heterogeneity or bias 
were not evident for sugar sweetened beverages. 
For artificially sweetened beverages, publication 
bias and residual confounding were indicated. For 
fruit juice the finding was non-significant in studies 
ascertaining type 2 diabetes objectively (P for 
heterogeneity=0.008). Under specified 
assumptions for population attributable fraction, of 
20.9 million events of type 2 diabetes predicted to 
occur over 10 years in the USA (absolute event rate 
11.0%), 1.8 million would be attributable to 
consumption of sugar sweetened beverages 
(population attributable fraction 8.7%, 95% 
confidence interval 3.9% to 12.9%); and of 2.6 
million events in the UK (absolute event rate 5.8%), 
79 000 would be attributable to consumption of 
sugar sweetened beverages (population 
attributable fraction 3.6%, 1.7% to 5.6%).
COnClusiOns
Habitual consumption of sugar sweetened beverages 
was associated with a greater incidence of type 2 
diabetes, independently of adiposity. Although 
artificially sweetened beverages and fruit juice also 
showd positive associations with incidence of type 2 
diabetes, the findings were likely to involve bias. None 
the less, both artificially sweetened beverages and 
fruit juice were unlikely to be healthy alternatives to 
sugar sweetened beverages for the prevention of type 
2 diabetes. Under assumption of causality, 
consumption of sugar sweetened beverages over years 
may be related to a substantial number of cases of 
new onset diabetes.

Introduction
The health effects of sugar sweetened beverages, artifi-
cially  sweetened  beverages,  and  fruit  juice  have 
received  considerable  attention  from  scientific  and 
public communities. The consumption of sugar sweet-
ened beverages is likely to contribute to an increase in 
obesity and the development of type 2 diabetes.1-5  Arti-
ficially sweetened beverages and fruit juice are candi-
date  alternatives  to  sugar  sweetened  beverages,  but 
their prospective associations with type 2 diabetes have

not yet been well established because only a few  studies 
have examined the associations, of which potential bias 
has been debated.5-9

Each of these beverage types has been investigated 
and reviewed for prospective associations with inci-
dent type 2 diabetes.4-9  A few quantitative reviews were 
available, but one aggregated studies that did and did 
not adjust for obesity status4 9  and the other separated 
such studies ad hoc only for those of sugar sweetened 
beverages and not for those of artificially sweetened 
beveraor fruit juice.5  It is crucial to better characterise 
the influence of adiposity because obesity can directly 
cause type 2 diabetes and thus mediate an association 
between consumption of sugar sweetened beverages 
and type 2 diabetes;4 5  and because obesity can be a 
confounder by altering dietary habits and confounding 
an  association  between  beverage  consumption  and 
incident type 2 diabetes.8 10  Previous studies indeed 
reported that obese individuals tend to consume more 
sugar sweetened and artificially sweetened beverages 
and less fruit juice than leaner individuals.6 10 11  More-
over, despite the growing interest in a policy interven-
tion  to  reduce  the  consumption  of  sugar  sweetened 
beverages  at  a  population  level,12 13 14  no  study  has 
translated  a  prospective  association  between  con-
sumption of sugar sweetened beverages and type 2 dia-
betes into a measure of its population level impact, 
including population attributable fraction, in a con-
temporary population.

We  therefore  conducted  a  systematic  review  and 
meta-analysis of prospective studies to test whether or 
not habitual consumption of sugar sweetened bever-
ages,  artificially  sweetened  beverages,  or  fruit  juice 
would be associated with the incidence of type 2 diabe-
tes. We specifically aimed to meta-analyse the associa-
tions  with  and  without  adjustment  for  adiposity, 
because the association may be both mediated and con-
founded by this factor. To provide policy relevant mea-
sures, we then used the result of the meta-analysis for 
sugar sweetened beverages to estimate the population 
attributable fraction for the 10 year risk of developing 
type 2 diabetes due to consumption of sugar sweetened 
beverages in contemporary populations of the United 
States and United Kingdom, where approximately half 
of  each  population  in  recent  years  consumed  sugar 
sweetened beverages.1 10

Methods
Patient involvement
There was no patient involvement in this study.

study searches and selection
Following the PRISMA guidelines15  and the protocol 
(not registered, available on request), we identified 
relevant studies through hand searches and system-
atic  searches  of  four  databases  on  31  May  2013 
(updated  on  10  February  2014):  PubMed,  Embase, 
Ovid, and Web of Knowledge. Search terms included 
those related to types of beverages, diabetes, and pro-
spective study design (see supplementary information 
for details). Time and language of publications were 

not  restricted.  After  the  removal  of  duplicates,  one 
author (FI) screened the articles on the basis of the 
titles and abstracts and three authors (FI, LO’C, and 
ZY)  independently  reviewed  them  in  duplicate.  We 
considered studies to be eligible for inclusion if they 
were of a prospective design, assessed the consump-
tion of beverages and incident type 2 diabetes, and 
recruited adults free of diabetes and aged 18 years or 
older. We also considered a follow-up of at least two 
years on average because incidence of diabetes could 
alter  approximately  two  years  after  modification  of 
lifestyle.16 17

Data extraction and quality assessment
We extracted information in a standardised manner in 
duplicate,  including  baseline  personal  information 
such as body mass index, and duration of follow-up, 
exclusion  criteria,  sample  size,  loss  to  follow-up, 
assessments  of  beverage  consumption  and  incident 
type 2 diabetes, types of beverage consumed, measures 
of prospective associations with 95% confidence inter-
vals, covariates evaluated, and sources of funding. We 
extracted measures of associations that were the most 
adjusted  for  sociodemographic  and  lifestyle  factors, 
with and without further adjustment for adiposity mea-
sures. Although adjustment for total energy intake is 
important to assess,4 6 in this meta-analysis we used 
estimates adjusted for total energy whenever possible 
for parsimony and potentials for energy adjustment to 
reduce  confounding  and  measurement  errors.18  We 
extracted estimates stratified by age, sex, and adiposity 
measures,  if  reported,  to  use  in  meta-regression  to 
assess heterogeneity. Additional information on study 
design and quality was also obtained from identified 
articles as well as from relevant articles of identified 
cohorts.

We contacted authors of identified articles to request 
additional information if the article did not report two 
types of estimates before and after adjustment for adi-
posity, based on either categorical or continuous analy-
sis for sugar sweetened beverages, artificially sweetened 
beverages,  and  fruit  juice  separately.  When  we  con-
tacted authors we requested estimates before and after 
adjustment for adiposity based on both continuous and 
categorical variables of each beverage consumed, and 
we requested estimates based on longer follow-up if 
available. In addition we contacted authors of cohorts 
that did not meet eligibility criteria but could be eligible 
on the provision of additional information (see supple-
mentary table S1).

We examined risks of bias in concordance with the 
Cochrane  tools,  including  a  Cochrane  risk  of  bias 
assessment tool for non-randomised studies of inter-
ventions.19-21   Seven  domains  were  assessed:  con-
founding,  selection,  exposure  measurement, 
misclassification  over  time,  missing  data,  outcome 
measurement, and selective reporting. Bias specific to 
this meta-analysis included the likelihood of misclas-
sifying sugar sweetened fruit drink as fruit juice (for 
example, fruit punch). Sources of bias were evaluated 
by  using  meta-regression  for  each  as  a  potential

source  of  heterogeneity,  meta-analysis  excluding 
studies with a certain type of bias, or meta-analysis 
incorporating quantitative measures of bias (see sup-
plementary information). Overall quality of evidence 
was assessed based on study quality, results from sen-
sitivity analysis, and principles of the grades of rec-
ommendation,  assessment,  development,  and 
evaluation  (GRADE).22  One  author  (FI)  first  sum-
marised the results of bias assessment and quality of 
overall  evidence  and  these  results  were  discussed 
among the other authors (FI, LOC, YZ, and NGF) for 
consensus.

meta-analysis
We used Stata 13.1 for analyses (α two sided P=0.05, 
unless indicated). Statistical details are described in the 
supplementary information. Each of sugar sweetened 
beverages, artificially sweetened beverages, and fruit 
juice was considered as the main exposure. We defined 
sugar sweetened beverages as any sweetened bever-
ages, including sugar sweetened fruit juice, not pre-
sented  as  diet  or  non-caloric  beverages.  Artificially 
sweetened beverages included low caloric soft drinks as 
reported in each study. Fruit juice was defined as 100% 
fruit juice, or fruit juice assessed separately from fruit 
drinks. We standardised measures of associations to 
relative risk per one serving/day of beverage consump-
tion, after we confirmed that this unit was the most fre-
quently used in studies. Because volume per serving 
was specific to a population, ranging from 237 mL (one 
cup) to 355 mL (12 oz) (median across publications=250 
mL/day), we repeated meta-analysis to estimate the rel-
ative  risk  for  each  250  mL/day.  We  converted  odds 
ratios, if reported, to relative risks.23  If a study reported 
categorical  estimates  only,  they  were  combined  to 
obtain a single dose-response estimate.24 If only strati-
fied estimates were reported, we merged them by fixed 
effects meta-analysis to derive a cohort specific esti-
mate, assuming consistency of associations within a 
cohort.

We performed random effects meta-analysis as pre-
specified, assuming that biological effects of bever-
ages in different populations would vary randomly at 
least  by  processing  and  composition  of  beverages. 
The heterogeneity of associations was expressed by 
I2.25   For  each  of  the  beverages  of  interest,  we  esti-
mated relative risks before and after adjustment for 
adiposity measures. To assess a magnitude of overall 
confounding, we additionally estimated crude rela-
tive risks without any adjustment. Non-linear associ-
ations  were  additionally  evaluated  by  cubic  spline 
meta-analysis for which we used available categorical 
estimates.24

In observational studies, within person variability 
of exposure can cause bias.26-30  As performed previ-
ously,26-32  we compiled within person variation of bev-
erage  consumption  in  each  study  and  adjusted  for 
them to estimates of each study. Uncertainty in self 
reported diagnosis of type 2 diabetes was also cali-
brated  for  estimates  from  studies  without  objective 
information on incidence of type 2 diabetes.33 To compute 

relative risks adjusted for within person dietary vari-
ation and uncertainty of type 2 diabetes ascertain-
ment,  we  pooled  the  estimates  after  study  specific 
 calibration.

Meta-regression was used to assess if heterogeneity 
of associations across studies depended on population 
demographics, study characteristics, and indicators of 
errors or bias. Publication status (peer reviewed or not), 
selective reporting (yes or no), and mutual adjustment 
for three beverage types were evaluated after we identi-
fied  studies  with  those  characteristics.  Stratified 
meta-analysis was performed by each variable that pre-
dicted heterogeneity (P<0.01) and by prespecified vari-
ables: age, sex, body mass index, and study location. In 
exploratory analysis using multiple variables of study 
specific  factors,  we  reassessed  I2  as  a  magnitude  of 
unexplained heterogeneity.

Publication bias was assessed by Egger’s test, with a 
contour enhanced funnel plot, and ‘trim and fill’ analy-
sis.34  If publication bias was indicated, we adjusted 
summary estimates for the bias.34  Robustness of sum-
mary findings was examined by sensitivity analyses: 
influence analysis,32  fixed effects meta-analysis, analy-
sis using millilitres per day as a unit, analysis without 
studies with a high overall risk of bias, and analysis 
incorporating measures of uncertainty in adjustment 
for within person dietary variations and diagnosis of 
type 2 diabetes.35

Adiposity  is  likely  to  confound  an  association  of 
beverage consumption with type 2 diabetes, particu-
larly  in  research  on  artificially  sweetened  bever-
ages.6 8 10 11   Because  of  imperfect  measurement  of 
adiposity in an epidemiological study,36  adjustment 
for adiposity was likely to be insufficient, as discussed 
previously.3 6 32 37-41  Thus, to assess if such residual con-
founding would be substantial, we performed simula-
tion analysis to examine the influence of the bias.42

type 2 diabetes risk attributable to sugar 
sweetened beverages in usa and uK
We estimated the risks of type 2 diabetes attributable to 
consumption  of  sugar  sweetened  beverages  over  10 
years in the USA and UK.43 44  These countries contrib-
uted to the meta-analysis to the largest extent and pro-
vided publically available data on diets and risk factors 
for type 2 diabetes: the US national health and nutri-
tion examination survey, 2009-1045  and the UK national 
diet and nutrition survey, 2008-12.46 The recent cycle 
was selected for greater generalisability to recent pop-
ulations. Selecting adults aged 20 years or more and 
without  prevalent  diabetes,  we  analysed  4729  US 
adults and 1932 UK adults. Accounting for sampling 
weight, 189.1 million US adults and 44.7 million UK 
adults were represented.

We estimated the population attributable fraction by 
applying a Cochrane Collaboration algorithm to survey 
data.43 44  We first estimated habitual consumption of 
sugar sweetened beverages based on 24 hour recalls in 
the USA and four day food records in the UK. Then we 
estimated the 10 year risk of type 2 diabetes based on a 
risk prediction algorithm developed and validated in

each country.47  48  The predicted risk for each individ-
ual was considered as an “assumed control risk”44  if 
the current consumption of sugar sweetened bever-
ages would remain constant. Then we calculated an 
 alternative risk if the consumption of sugar sweetened 
beverages would become zero, calculating assumed 
control risk×(1/relative risk per serving/day)×observed 
sugar sweetened beverages servings/day. The differ-
ence between the two risk estimates represented a risk 
attributable to consumption of sugar sweetened bever-
ages. Using the risk estimates, sampling weights, and 
a population size, we estimated the absolute numbers 
of  events  over  10  years,  events  attributable  to  con-
sumption of sugar sweetened beverages (absolute risk 
reduction44), and population attributable fraction (the 
proportion of events attributable to consumption of 
sugar sweetened beverages). The estimation assumed 
causality and no change in individuals’ characteris-
tics over time. Validation of 10 year risk prediction 
was  performed  in  the  US  survey,  in  which  we  pre-
dicted diabetes prevalence in 2009-10 by using data 
collected in 1999-2000. Sensitivity analysis was per-
formed to estimate the population attributable frac-
tion  by  varying  relative  risks  and  accounting  for 
uncertainty. Further details are presented in the sup-
plementary  information.

Results
After the removal of duplicates, we identified 1937 arti-
cles, reviewed 33 in full text, and identified 21 articles of 
16 cohorts as being eligible for this meta-analysis (see 
supplementary  figure  S1).  We  obtained  unpublished 
information on one cohort from a publication that did 
not meet eligibility criteria (see supplementary table 
S1).22   Finally,  we  evaluated  data  from  17  cohorts 
(table 1 )11  39-41 49-65 comprising 38 253 cases of type 2 dia-
betes over 10 126 756 person years in total. No study or 
publication was funded by industry.

The quality of the studies has been examined (see 
supplementary table S2). Methods of assessing diets 
and ascertaining type 2 diabetes and validity of these 
measurements varied across studies (table 1 and sup-
plementary table S3). We identified potential bias in 
the quantitative results for six cohorts based on at 
least one of the following: publication of a conference 
abstract only,62  exclusion of participants lost during 
follow-up,57  63  likelihood of substantial residual con-
founding,40   and  no  separation  between  fruit  juice 
and  sugar  sweetened  beverages  (fruit  drinks)  or 
between sugar sweetened beverages and artificially 
sweetened beverages.57 64  Selective reporting might 
exist in some studies,39  52  55  58  62 64  but it was unlikely 
to cause bias—for example, reporting only non-quan-
titative  results  for  sugar  sweetened  beverages  in  a 
study mainly on artificially sweetened beverages.39  
Other potential sources of bias were detected, but we 
did not consider them to be substantially influential 
on overall bias in each study, partly based on results 
of sensitivity analyses. No study assessed subtypes of 
sugar  sweetened  beverages,  artificially  sweetened 

beverages, or fruit juice, except one that separated 
beverages by caffeine content.49

Confounding was likely to exist in all of the studies. 
As would be expected, consumers of artificially sweet-
ened beverages tended to be overweight or obese or 
hypertensive.11 39 50 59 66   In  longitudinal  analysis,  all 
studies statistically adjusted for potential confounders, 
such as sociodemographic variables, clinical factors 
(family history of diabetes or prevalent diseases), and 
lifestyle  factors,  including  diet  (see  supplementary 
table  S4).  None  of  these  factors  was  identified  as  a 
 single  cause  of  confounding,  according  to  studies 
assessing influence of potential confounding in differ-
ent regression models.11 41 49-51 54 59 61 63-65  However, a com-
bination  of  multiple  factors  was  likely  to  cause 
confounding  (table  2  and  supplementary  table  S4). 
After adjustment for multiple potential confounders, 
the  relative  risk  for  sugar  sweetened  beverages  was 
attenuated from 1.25 to 1.18 (32% change), and for artifi-
cially sweetened beverages from 1.48 to 1.25 (43%). By 
contrast, the point estimate for fruit juice was shifted 
upwards, from 0.97 to 1.05.

beverage consumption and type 2 diabetes
Table 2 summarises the findings from meta-analysis. 
Higher consumption of sugar sweetened beverages by 
one serving per day was associated with an 18% greater 
incidence of type 2 diabetes (95% confidence interval 
8.8% to 28%; I2=89%) before adjustment for adiposity 
(fig 1 and table 2). When adjusted for potential media-
tion and confounding by adiposity, the association was 
attenuated, with the incidence increased by 13% per 
serving/day (5.8% to 21%; I2=79%). In the analysis of 
artificially  sweetened  beverages,  in  which  adiposity 
was unlikely to be a mediator, higher consumption of 
artificially sweetened beverages by one serving per day 
was associated with a 25% greater incidence of type 2 
diabetes (95% confidence interval 18% to 33%; I2=70%) 
before adjustment for adiposity. After adjustment, the 
estimate of 25% greater incidence was attenuated to 8% 
(2.1% to 15%).

In the analysis of fruit juice, the influence of adjust-
ment for adiposity was in the direction opposite to that 
of the analysis for sugar sweetened beverages and arti-
ficially sweetened beverages. The association of fruit 
juice consumption with incident type 2 diabetes was 
strengthened after adjustment for adiposity measures. 
Higher consumption of fruit juice by one serving/day 
was associated with a 7% greater incidence of type 2 
diabetes (95% confidence interval 0.8% to 14%).

Each of the beverages showed significant non-linear 
associations (P>0.05) (supplementary figure S2). Cali-
bration for within person variation strengthened the 
association between each type of beverage and incident 
type 2 diabetes (fig 1 and table 2). For example, the rela-
tive risk per one serving/day of sugar sweetened bever-
ages  was  strengthened,  from  1.13  (95%  confidence 
interval 1.06 to 1.21) to 1.28 (1.12 to 1.46). Estimates for 
artificially  sweetened  beverages  were  strengthened 
similarly. The influence was small for fruit juice, where

table 2 | associations between consumption of sugar sweetened beverages, artificially sweetened beverages, and fruit

*Number of cohorts varied slightly by models (see fig 1). Crude meta-analysis pooled estimates without any adjustment. Multivariable adjusted 
estimates were based on meta-analysis of estimates adjusted for demographic and lifestyle covariates (see supplementary table S4 for details). 
Calibration for information bias accounted for within person variation for dietary consumption and imprecise ascertainment of self reported diabetes. 
Calibration for publication bias was carried out, if indicated in trim and fill analysis. 
†Relative risk and 95% confidence intervals per serving/day before and after adjustment for adiposity. All relative risks were significant (P<0.05), except 
for artificially sweetened beverages after adjustment for publication bias (P=0.07).

the relative risk was shifted only slightly, from 1.07 (1.01

sensitivity analysis and quality of evidence
None  of  the  study  specific  factors  evaluated  could 
explain heterogeneity of results for sugar sweetened 
beverages and artificially sweetened beverages (P>0.1) 
(see  supplementary  table  S5).  Exploratory  meta- 
regression produced an I2 of 23.4% for sugar sweet-
ened beverages and of 67.8% for artificially sweetened 
beverages,  adjusted  for  population  demographics 
(age, sex, country, incidence), body mass index, fol-
low-up duration, and measures of study quality. The 
results for fruit juice varied by study design. While 
studies assessing self reported type 2 diabetes only 
showed a positive association, the significant associa-
tion disappeared in studies ascertaining the incidence 
of type 2 diabetes by medical records or by blood glu-
cose or glycated haemoglobin level (relative risk 1.08, 
0.97 to 1.20; P for heterogeneity=0.008). Additionally, 
studies with repeated measures of diets supported a 
null  finding  (0.98,  0.86  to  1.11;  P  for  heterogene-
ity=0.068). These factors of study design explained 
heterogeneity of the association, reducing I2 from 29% 
to 0%. Demographic variables and body mass index 
did not explain heterogeneity (P>0.14 each), whereas 
sugar  sweetened  beverages,  artificially  sweetened 
beverages, and fruit juice were not significantly asso-
ciated with type 2 diabetes in studies recruiting more 
men than women or conducted in Asia, with a fewer 
number of studies than in the main analysis (supple-
mentary table S5).

Publication  bias  was  not  evident  by  Egger’s  test 
(P>0.05),  except  for  fruit  juice  (P=0.03),  where  esti-
mates with the greater precision showed stronger asso-
ciations (fig 2). Trim and fill indicated publication bias 
for both sugar sweetened and artificially sweetened 

beverages  (table  2).  In  particular,  publication  bias 
could  influence  inference  for  artificially  sweetened 
beverages. With adjustment for adiposity, the relative 
risk per one serving/day of artificially sweetened bev-
erages  was  1.29  (1.08  to  1.54)  before  calibration  for 
publication bias and 1.22 (0.98 to 1.52) after calibration 
(table 2).

Contour  enhanced  funnel  plots  indicated  that  the 
findings for artificially sweetened beverages and fruit 
juice were not stable (fig 2). For example, if a study with 
a relative risk of 0.5 contributed to the meta-analysis, 
associations  of  artificially  sweetened  beverages  and 
fruit juice with type 2 diabetes incidence would not be 
significant. In influence analysis, positive associations 
persisted for sugar sweetened beverages and artificially 
sweetened  beverages  (see  supplementary  figure  S3), 
whereas a significant result of fruit juice was not seen 
after excluding any single studies supporting the posi-
tive association.

The results varied little by methodological assump-
tion (see supplementary table S6), using estimates per 
250  mL/day  (median  of  17  studies)  rather  than  per 
serving/day;  excluding  studies  with  a  high  risk  of 
potential bias or with relatively large within person 
dietary variability; and incorporating uncertainty of 
within person variability and precision of type 2 diabe-
tes diagnosis. When we examined the potential influ-
ence of residual confounding by measured adiposity, 
bias towards the null appeared substantial for artifi-
cially sweetened beverages (see supplementary figure 
S4). Under a realistic assumption of a correlation of 
0.80 between measured and true adiposity,36 the asso-
ciation for sugar sweetened beverages was attenuated 
by 26% (relative risk 1.20, 1.04 to 1.38), for artificially 
sweetened  beverages  was  attenuated  by  96%  (1.01, 
0.81 to 1.25), and for fruit juice was strengthened by 
19% (1.12, 1.03 to 1.22).

We rated the quality of evidence for sugar sweetened 
beverages, artificially sweetened beverages, and fruit 
juice. The evidence for sugar sweetened beverages was 
rated as being of moderate quality. The main finding 
rejected the null hypothesis and was likely to have a 
small degree of heterogeneity unexplained, a dose-re-
sponse relation, and robustness against potential bias 

or limitations including publication bias. We rated the 
evidence for artificially sweetened beverages and fruit 
juice to be of low quality. Findings for artificially sweet-
ened beverages were likely to have publication bias 
and residual confounding; and for fruit juice, the posi-
tive  association  was  not  stable  and  varied  by  study 
design.

type 2 diabetes risk attributable to sugar 
sweetened beverages
Overall, sugar sweetened beverages were consumed by 
54.4% of people in the USA and 49.4% in the UK. Of a 
total  population,  the  mean  consumption  of  sugar 
sweetened beverages was 284 (SD 412) g/day in the USA 
and 114 (SD 157) g/day in the UK (fig 3 and supplemen-
tary table S7). Absolute event rates over 10 years from 
2010 were estimated to be 11.0% in the USA (20.9 mil-
lion events) and 5.8% in the UK (2.6 million events). 
Assuming  a  causal  effect  of  consumption  of  sugar 
sweetened beverages partly mediated by obesity status 

(adiposity unadjusted), consumption in the USA would 
result in 2.6 million excess events of type 2 diabetes over 
10 years (population attributable fraction 11.9%, 95% 
confidence interval 7.4% to 16.5%); and 126 000 excess 
events in the UK (population attributable fraction 4.9%, 
3.0% to 7.2%). Assuming a causal effect of consumption 
of sugar sweetened beverages independent of obesity 
status (adiposity adjusted), consumption would result 
in  1.8  million  excess  events  in  the  USA  (population 
attributable fraction 8.7%, 3.9% to 12.9%) and 79 000 
excess events in the UK (population attributable frac-
tion 3.6%, 1.7% to 5.6%). Younger adults and men would 
have greater numbers of type 2 diabetes events related 
to  consumption  of  sugar  sweetened  beverages  than 
older adults and women, respectively (fig 3 and supple-
mentary  table  S7).  The  greater  the  uncertainty 
accounted for, the lesser the precision was computed 
(see supplementary figure S5). For example, if I2=50%, 
the population attributable fraction of 11.9% in the USA 
would have a 95% confidence interval of 5.2% to 18.3%, 
but remained significant from 0 for the relative risks we 
estimated. 

discussion
In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we have 
produced summary evidence that habitual consump-
tion of sugar sweetened beverages, artificially sweet-
ened  beverages,  and  fruit  juice  was  prospectively 
associated with incident type 2 diabetes, independently 
of  adiposity.  Sensitivity  analyses  consistently  sup-
ported the positive association of sugar sweetened bev-
erages with incident type 2 diabetes. In contrast, the 
association between artificially sweetened beverages or 
fruit juice and incident type 2 diabetes was less evident. 
For artificially sweetened beverages, potential publica-
tion bias and residual confounding were likely to exist. 
For fruit juice, the finding seemed to be unstable and 
was sensitive to study design. Under assumption of cau-
sality  for  the  association  of  consumption  of  sugar 
sweetened beverages with incidence of type 2 diabetes, 
we provided efficacy estimates that over 10 years two 
million type 2 diabetes events in the USA and 80 000 in 
the UK would be related to consumption of sugar sweet-
ened beverages.

strengths and limitations of this review
This study has limitations typical of observational stud-
ies  and  meta-analysis.  Residual  confounding  could 
exist.37  Confounding  by  socioeconomic  and  dietary 
 factors was not detected to be strong in published stud-
ies. However, measures of these variables were likely to 
involve errors such that residual confounding persisted 
in individual studies and our meta-analysis. Addition-
ally, lifestyle factors and adiposity could change over 
time. The time varying characteristics might not be ran-
dom and could result in bias in an unknown direction. 
Reverse causality could also exist because of unmea-
sured comorbid conditions and health consciousness 
that might alter consumption of beverages, particularly 
artificially sweetened ones, and risk of type 2 diabetes. 
Weakness of meta-analysis includes the exclusion of

eligible cohorts for lack of information. Our meta- analysis 
included statistical approximation that might involve 
errors.  For  example,  we  derived  dose-response  esti-
mates partly from categorical estimates and odds ratios. 
Without such approximations, analysis standardised 
across different cohorts is of future interest to character-
ise associations between various beverages and risks of 
type 2 diabetes. Finally, assessments of bias and quality 
of evidence involved subjectivity, although we objec-
tively examined the influence of potential bias in tests 
for heterogeneity and sensitivity analyses.

One strength of this study was in estimating popula-
tion attributable fraction for risks of type 2 diabetes 
related to consumption of sugar sweetened beverages in 
the USA and UK, using data on beverage consumption 
for each individual. While a few studies estimated how 
much  taxation  on  sugar  sweetened  beverages  influ-
enced risk of obesity and type 2 diabetes,12-14  no study 
examined the population impact by combining esti-
mates for consumption of sugar sweetened beverages in 
multiple populations, predicted the risk of type 2 diabe-
tes by using a validated algorithm, or provided quanti-
tative evidence on the association of consumption of 
sugar  sweetened  beverages  with  incidence  of  type  2 
diabetes. However, the population attributable fraction 
was limited in precision owing to underlying relative 
risks and uncertainty in generalisability. The other lim-
itations are that we estimated the population attribut-
able  fraction  under  the  assumption  of  causality, 
although it has not been established; and the assump-
tion that there would be no change over time in lifestyle 
associated with consumption of sugar sweetened bever-
ages. Future work should seek to improve precision of 
evidence and to characterise efficacy and effectiveness 
of policy interventions for different populations. Gener-
alisability should be explored—for example, for popu-
lations in Central and South America with the highest 
recorded per capita sales of sugar sweetened beverages 
in the world; and China and India where the highest 

prevalence of type 2 diabetes is expected.1 67 To mini-
mise limitations typical of observational research and 
understand effectiveness of a policy intervention in dif-
ferent populations, future research should also include 
randomised  trials  examining  people’s  health  and 
behaviours and informing effectiveness.

interpretation in relation to other studies
Other  quantitative  reviews  have  been  published 
recently.4 5 9  None of them quantified the population 
attributable fraction. One meta-analysis evaluated the 
influence of adiposity on the association of sugar sweet-
ened beverages and type 2 diabetes based on three stud-
ies,  but  not  artificially  sweetened  beverages  or  fruit 
juice.5 For sugar sweetened beverages, we evaluated a 
greater number of type 2 diabetes cases (38 285 v 19 054) 
and studies (17 v 3), including bias assessments and 
sensitivity  analyses.  For  fruit  juice  and  artificially 
sweetened beverages, we evaluated a greater number of 
studies than previous work (9 v 4 and 12 v 4, respec-
tively) and drew conclusions based on assessment of 
the influences of adiposity and potential bias that were 
found to be important.

The plausibility of our findings deserves discussion. 
Detrimental effects of sugar sweetened beverages inde-
pendent of obesity may exist. Sugars in sugar sweet-
ened beverages acutely increased blood glucose levels 
and have a high glycaemic index (80 to 110/100 of white 
bread), a risk factor for type 2 diabetes.68 69  Fructose in 
sugar sweetened beverages promotes hepatic lipogene-
sis and further insulin resistance.2  Effects of caramels 
for  colouring  beverages,70   caffeine,49 71   phosphoric 
acid,72  and  other  constituents  may  also  exist.  These 
non-glycaemic  effects  may  be  present  in  artificially 
sweetened beverages, if such beverages truly increase 
the risk of type 2 diabetes. Artificially sweetened bever-
ages might have effects on hormones, microbiota, and 
taste  preference,  but  evidence  for  these  remains 
weak.6  73 74   Adverse  effects  of  fruit  juice  would  be

 present because of its moderately high glycaemic index 
(50-80).68  Healthful constituents may exist but decrease 
during  processing.7 75   This  explains  why  our  finding 
was discordant with the inverse association of consum-
ing fruits as food with type 2 diabetes.76

Our analysis indicated possible publication bias for 
the associations between artificially sweetened bever-
ages and type 2 diabetes. The bias toward a false posi-
tive finding would be plausible according to existing 
public interest over the health effects.6  77  The finding at 
least underscores potential low quality of evidence and 
the  need  for  cautious  interpretation.  Residual 
 confounding in the finding for artificially sweetened 
beverages is also plausible because adults at high risk 
of type 2 diabetes preferentially consumed more artifi-
cially  sweetened  beverages.5 6 8 10 11 36   Confounding  in 
the opposite direction in the finding for fruit juice is 
also plausible because leaner adults at lower risk of 
type 2 diabetes consumed more fruit juice.10 11  These 
observations provide research and clinical implications 
for better understanding of health seeking behaviours 
related to beverage consumption.6 78

Clinical and public health implications
Although causality has not been established, our find-
ings and available evidence indicate a benefit of reduc-
ing the consumption of sugar sweetened beverages for 
the primary prevention of type 2 diabetes. In the same 
context, our findings also imply that consumption of 
artificially  sweetened  beverages  or  fruit  juice  is  not 
likely to reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes and, thus, not 
suitable as a healthy option. None the less, the lower 
caloric intake of artificially sweetened beverages may 
be of clinical benefit in obese or overweight adults by 
helping to reduce body weight.6 78 This effect on body 
weight should be considered separately from our study, 
which could not rule out the effect of body weight on 
beverage consumption.8  Additionally, clinical applica-
tions of our finding deserve further appraisal about the 
effects of altering beverage consumption on changes in 
lifestyle  behaviours  and  on  risks  of  other  clinical 
 outcomes.3 6 8

Our findings have strong public health implications. 
Despite the limitations of this review, the current con-
sumption of sugar sweetened beverages was estimated 
to cause approximately two million excess events of 
type 2 diabetes in the USA and 80 000 in the UK over 10 
years. This could cost nearly £12.0bn in the USA and 
£206m in the UK ($9800 in the USA and $3994 in the UK 
per  patient,67   $1  (£0.65;  €0.91  as  of  7  July  2015).  In 
future, our work on efficacy should be extended to that 
on effectiveness to identify needs for interventions. In 
addition  to  observational  evidence,  trial  evidence 
should be available, accounting for the effects on car-
diometabolic  health  and  lifestyle  change  associated 
with a possible intervention.8 78 Despite a population 
attributable fraction of no more than 20%, effectiveness 
should be evaluated for different populations, as an 
estimated 592 million adults globally will have type 2 
diabetes in 2035.1 67  Additionally, the average popula-
tion attributable fraction of no more than 20% confirms 

the importance of modifying multiple lifestyle risk fac-
tors rather than a single dietary component, for the pri-
mary  prevention  of  type  2  diabetes.  For  artificially 
sweetened  beverages  and  fruit  juice,  our  findings 
inform little benefit of using them as an alternative to 
sugar sweetened beverages. In addition, fruit juice con-
sumption should not be a part of dietary recommenda-
tions for greater consumption of fruits and vegetables, 
as suggested to limit fruit juice consumption among 
children.7  79

Conclusions
Observational cohort studies support that consumption 
of sugar sweetened beverages is associated with inci-
dent type 2 diabetes, and independently of adiposity. 
This finding was stable in sensitivity analyses assessing 
influence of population characteristics, potential resid-
ual  confounding,  and  publication  bias.  By  contrast, 
although  artificially  sweetened  beverages  and  fruit 
juice showed a positive association with incident type 2 
diabetes, the quality of evidence is limited by potential 
bias and heterogeneity by study design. Although cau-
sality has not been established and precision needs to 
be improved, this study informs the potential efficacy of 
reducing the consumption of sugar sweetened bever-
ages in a contemporary population. Moreover, findings 
support that neither artificially sweetened beverages 
nor fruit juice are suitable alternatives to sugar sweet-
ened beverages for the prevention of type 2 diabetes.

OBJECTIVE — This meta-analysis was undertaken to obtain insight regarding the shape and
strength of the relationship between alcohol consumption and the risk of type 2 diabetes, the
effects of adjustment for confounders, and the effect of modiﬁcation by type 2 diabetes deﬁni-
tion, sex, and BMI.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS — The 15 original prospective cohort studies
that were included comprise 11,959 incident cases of type 2 diabetes in 369,862 individuals
who, on average, were followed for 12 years.

RESULTS — After pooling the data, a U-shaped relationship was found. Compared with
nonconsumers, the relative risk (RR) for type 2 diabetes in those who consumed ⱕ6 g/day
alcohol was 0.87 (95% CI 0.79 – 0.95). For the moderate consumption ranges of 6 –12, 12–24,
and 24 – 48 g/day, RRs of 0.70 (0.61– 0.79), 0.69 (0.58 – 0.81), and 0.72 (0.62– 0.84) were
found, respectively. The risk of type 2 diabetes in heavy drinkers (ⱖ48 g/day) was equal to that
in nonconsumers (1.04 [0.84 –1.29]). In general, nonsigniﬁcant trends for larger RR reduction
associated with moderate alcohol consumption were observed for women compared with men,
for crude compared with multivariate-adjusted analyses, and for studies that used self-reports
instead of testing for type 2 diabetes deﬁnition. No differences in RR reductions were found
between individuals with low or high BMI.

CONCLUSIONS — The present evidence from observational studies suggests an ⬃30%
reduced risk of type 2 diabetes in moderate alcohol consumers, whereas no risk reduction is
observed in consumers of ⱖ48 g/day.

T he prevalence of type 2 diabetes is

Alcohol consumption is a lifestyle fac-
rising to epidemic proportions. Be-
tor that also has been suggested to be rel-
tween 2000 and 2030, a 37% in-
evant with respect to the risk of type 2

diabetes. Several studies on the relation-
diabetes is expected (1). Next to the aging
ship between alcohol consumption and
of the population, the lack of physical ac-

magnitude of this decreased incidence
and the incidence associated with high
levels of alcohol consumption (3,4). Fur-
thermore, these reviews suggested that
sex, BMI, and the mode of type 2 diabetes
deﬁnition (self-report versus objective
testing) may be important confounders or
modiﬁers of the relationship. The objec-
tive of the present study, therefore, is to
perform a meta-analysis on the published
data and to calculate pooled estimates
with respect to these questions on the re-
lationship between alcohol consumption
and the risk of type 2 diabetes.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND
METHODS — Articles included were
found through a PubMed search of litera-
ture published between 1966 and July
2004. The search resulted in articles that
included the text words “(alcohol OR eth-
anol) AND diabetes AND (inciden* OR
(new AND cases))” but that did not in-
clude the text word “placebo,” or the sub-
ject heading “drug therapy.” In addition,
randomized controlled trials, editorials,
letters to the editor, meta-analyses, and
review articles were not included. Titles
and abstracts of the resulting publications
were screened for articles that are possibly
of interest for our meta-analysis. The ref-
erences in these articles and in relevant
reviews were checked for additional stud-
ies of interest. Included were original
peer-reviewed publications on observa-
tional cohort or nested case-control stud-
ies on the relationship between alcohol
consumption and incident type 2 diabe-
tes. Given the presumed nonlinear rela-
tionship, a point estimate and an estimate
of variability of type 2 diabetes risk
needed to be presented for at least two
alcohol consumption categories com-
pared with a third reference category (or
data should be given from which this
could be calculated). Alcohol consump-
tion categories needed to be quantiﬁable
in grams per day.

For studies that reported results from
various analyses including more or fewer
covariates, the estimates based on the mod-

el that included the most potential con-
founders (e.g., age, sex, smoking, phys-
ical activity) and that excluded putative
intermediate variables (fasting insulin or
HDL cholesterol levels) were abstracted.
For studies that only reported ranges
of alcohol consumption for the categories
used, the mean of the lower and upper
limits was used as the average consump-
tion for that range, and 1.5 times the
lower limit was assigned as the average
consumption in the highest category
(where no upper limit was given). The
factor 1.5 was based on the information in
included studies that reported the average
consumption in addition to the lower
limit of the highest consumption cate-
gory. The averages of the consumption
ranges that were used in a study were as-
signed to one of six alcohol categories that
were used in this meta-analysis: 0 (refer-
ence), ⬍6, 6 –12, 12–24, 24 – 48, and
ⱖ48 g/day. These alcohol categories were
chosen because it resulted in about an
equal number of independent observa-
tions within each stratum. A standard
drink contains ⬃12 g alcohol in the U.S./
Canada, 10 g in Europe/Australia, and
21 g in Japan. Stratiﬁed analyses were per-
formed because we were unable to ﬁnd
software to perform a meta-regression
analysis that takes into account the fact
that multiple observations from one study
are not independent and that can incor-
porate the weight (inverse of variance) of
the observations properly. Within the
strata chosen, multiple observations from
a single study were rare.

Odds ratios, relative risks (RRs), and
hazard ratios that are used in the original
publications were interpreted to reﬂect
RRs. Natural logarithms of the RR esti-
mates for each level of alcohol consump-
tion from the individual studies were used
to normalize the data. Natural logarithms
of the reported CI limits were used to cal-
culate the standard errors of the log RR
estimates of the included studies. If the
original study did not use the noncon-
sumers as a reference, the RRs were recal-
culated relative to the nondrinkers,
assuming equal variance of the RR esti-
mates when using the reported category
or the nondrinker category as a reference.
Pooled RR estimates were calculated
within each of the alcohol categories. Be-
cause the risk estimates differed more
across studies than expected from the
sampling error within studies, random-
effects models were used to combine the

reported data from these studies (5). If a
study reported more than one RR within
one of our six relatively small alcohol cat-
egories, one pooled RR was calculated for
the study in question per alcohol category
before pooling the RRs of the studies in
that category.

To examine potential publication
bias, separate funnel plots were drawn for
the alcohol categories because the meth-
od of assessing funnel plot asymmetry as-
sumes one overall RR. In this meta-
analysis, however, it was expected that
different RRs would be found for different
alcohol consumption categories. For each
funnel plot, the degree of asymmetry was
visually inspected and quantitatively
tested with a method modiﬁed from
Egger et al. (6) that uses the slope instead
of the intercept of a ﬁtted regression line.
In addition to the multivariate-
adjusted RRs, crude RRs were calculated
for studies that reported the number of in-
cident type 2 diabetic cases and noncases
(or person-years) per alcohol category. To
investigate the effect of confounding, the
RRs from these crude data were pooled
and compared with the pooled multivari-
ate-adjusted RRs from the same studies.
The RRs reported in studies that used self-
reports to determine a subject’s type 2 di-
abetes status were compared with the RRs
reported in studies that used biochemical
testing of type 2 diabetes status. Sex, BMI,
and type of beverage have been men-
tioned as putative modiﬁers of the rela-
tionship between alcohol consumption
and the risk of type 2 diabetes. We there-
fore calculated and compared pooled RRs
for men and women. From studies that
reported RR estimates for more than one
BMI stratum, the RRs reported for the
highest strata were pooled and compared
with the pooled RRs that are reported for
the lowest BMI strata. Modiﬁcation by type
of beverage was not analyzed because
only two studies reported alcohol con-
sumption category–speciﬁc RR estimates
for the different types of beverages (7,8).
Student’s t tests were used to study differ-
ences in pooled RRs between the crude
and adjusted data, between men and
women, and between high and low BMI.

RESULTS — Twenty-eight publica-
tions on the relationship between alcohol
consumption and the incidence of type 2
diabetes were found after reading titles
and abstracts of the 482 hits from the
PubMed search and after reference check-

ing. Independent assessment of these
publications by L.L.J.K. and J.M.D. with
respect to the eligibility for the meta-
analysis did not result in disagreement on
any publication. For three studies on
which multiple reports were published,
the most recent publication was included
while the others were excluded (9 –12).
Nine studies were not included because
their alcohol consumption data were not
quantiﬁable in grams per day (13–15) or
because of incompleteness with respect to
alcohol category–speciﬁc risk estimates
(16 –21). The search did not yield any
nested case-control study that met the in-
clusion criteria, whereas 15 relevant co-
hort studies were identiﬁed (7,8,22–34).
Table 1 shows characteristics of the
15 included studies. In total, our meta-
analysis comprises 11,959 incident cases
of type 2 diabetes in 369,862 individuals
who, on average, were followed for 12.0
years. All studies were published in peer-
reviewed journals. Four studies included
both male and female subjects, eight stud-
ies included only men, and three studies
only women. In seven studies, all partici-
pants were tested for the presence of type
2 diabetes; seven others relied on self-
reported diagnoses, while one study used
record linkage with national registers.
The included studies differed consider-
ably with respect to the number of con-
founders adjusted for (range 0 –15
confounders). In 8 of the 15 studies (7,8,
22,24,29 –32), various models including
more or fewer confounders were used to
calculate the RR of type 2 diabetes for the
alcohol categories used. The confounders
incorporated in the models that were cho-
sen to be included in this meta-analysis
are reported in Table 1.

Figure 1 shows the scatter plot of the
RRs of type 2 diabetes by alcohol con-
sumption (abstinence is the reference) as
reported in the 15 included studies. Fig-
ure 1 indicates considerable heterogene-
ity between the observations. The areas of
the circles differ substantially, indicating
that certain estimates add more statistical
power than others. The random-effect
pooled RRs that are also shown in Fig. 1
indicate a U-shaped relationship between
alcohol consumption and the risk of type
2 diabetes. The lowest risks were ob-
served in alcohol drinkers of 6 – 48 g/day.
The risk of type 2 diabetes in drinkers of
ⱖ48 g/day was equal to that of noncon-
sumers. No publication bias was sus-
pected after visual inspection or statistical

Alcohol and the risk of type 2 diabetes

drinking categories were not signiﬁcantly
smaller than those for men. These strati-
ﬁed analyses show that the lower risk of
type 2 diabetes of moderate alcohol con-
sumption is signiﬁcant in both men and
women.

Six studies reported results stratiﬁed
for two or three BMI categories (8,22,26,
29,30,32). The pooled RRs based on these
studies show no difference in the RR of
type 2 diabetes for low- and high-BMI
categories.

CONCLUSIONS — To our knowl-
edge, this is the ﬁrst meta-analysis on the
relationship between alcohol consump-
tion and the risk of type 2 diabetes. It
shows a U-shaped relationship with a
highly signiﬁcant ⬃30% reduced risk of
type 2 diabetes in alcohol consumers of
6 – 48 g/day compared with heavier con-
sumers or abstainers. Fifteen cohort stud-
ies on the relationship between alcohol
consumption and the risk of type 2 dia-
betes were retrieved. In the absence of
long-term randomized intervention stud-
ies, these can be considered the best avail-
able evidence.

The lower type 2 diabetes risk in
moderate drinkers was consistent over
most included studies. Despite this con-
sistency, the risk estimates differed more
across studies than was expected from the
sampling error within studies. We there-
fore studied whether multiple adjust-
ment, the type 2 diabetes deﬁnition used,
and differences between men and women

Figure 1—Scatterplot of the RR estimates of type 2 diabetes reported in the 15 included studies,

area of each circle is proportional to the precision of the RR estimate (inverse of its variance).

testing of the funnel plots drawn for the
alcohol consumption categories (graphs
not shown).

In 10 of the 15 included studies (7,
8,22–24,26,29 –32), the numbers of inci-
dent type 2 diabetic cases and noncases
(or person-years) were reported per alco-
hol category in addition to multivariate-
adjusted RR estimates. The pooled RRs
from these crude data and the pooled
multivariate-adjusted RRs are reported in
Table 2. The effect of confounding was
signiﬁcant for the lowest alcohol category.
Table 2 further indicates that lower RR
estimates were found in the studies that
used self-reports to assess a subject’s type

2 diabetes status (8,22,24,26,28,31,34)
than in studies that used glucose testing
to deﬁne type 2 diabetes (7,23,25,27,29,
30,33).

We further investigated possible
modiﬁcation of the relationship between
alcohol consumption and the risk of type
2 diabetes by sex and BMI (Table 2). All
but one study (25) gave sex-speciﬁc esti-
mates. In women, observations ⬎24
g/day were pooled because only one (im-
precise) observation ⬎48 g/day was re-
ported. A signiﬁcant sex difference was
found only for the alcohol consumption
range between 6 and 12 g/day. The RRs
for women that were found in the other

or individuals with low and high BMI
could explain the observed heterogeneity.
In most cases, this did not turn out to be
the case. Numerous other factors, how-
ever, may also have caused the observed
heterogeneity, such as differences in alco-
hol assessment methods, period of fol-
low-up, and all 30 confounders that were
adjusted for in some but not all included
studies.

A borderline signiﬁcant difference be-
tween the crude and multivariate-
adjusted pooled RRs was found for the
lowest consumption level. Adjustment for
confounders such as age, family history of
diabetes, and BMI appears to have some
attenuating effect on the estimated RRs. In
the seven studies that were based on self-
reported type 2 diabetes status, the RRs
associated with moderate drinking (6 – 48
g/day) were 0.57– 0.65, whereas in the
seven studies that used population testing
of type 2 diabetes, the RRs were 0.76 –
0.89. This difference may be due to the
higher frequency of alcohol abstainers at-
tending a general practitioner (35), result-
ing in relatively more diagnosed cases in
this group. The difference may also be
caused by a stronger relationship of alco-
hol consumption with the more severe
cases of diabetes that likely are overrep-
resented in studies relying soley on self-
report.

The apparent sex difference was due
to the relatively low RRs in the two
Nurses’ Health Studies and the Iowa
Women’s Health Study. The trend of
lower RRs in women than in men was not
found within the three studies that gave
results for both men and women (7,28,
32). Possibly, the trend for lower RRs in
women than in men is caused by a study-
related factor other than sex.

Within-study analyses showed that
the reduced risk associated with moder-
ate alcohol consumption was present
both in individuals with a relatively low
BMI and in those with a relatively high
BMI. The alcohol consumption level asso-
ciated with the lowest type 2 diabetes risk
appears to be lower in individuals with a
relatively low BMI (6 –12 g/day) than in
those with a higher BMI (12–24 g/day).

Several studies were not included be-
cause their data were not presented in a
way that could be used in our meta-
analysis. The unadjusted RRs that can be
calculated from the Women’s Health
Study show a convincing decrease in type
2 diabetes risk with the increase in drink-

ing frequency (14). Also in line with the
present ﬁndings, Hodge et al. (18), Lynch
et al. (13), and Watanabe et al. (21)
showed trends of a decreased risk of type
2 diabetes associated with alcohol con-
sumption. In three other excluded stud-
ies, logistic regression analyses were
performed with alcohol as a continuous
determinant of type 2 diabetes risk
(17,19,20). These studies suggest a posi-
tive relationship for men, which is in con-
trast with the ﬁrst part but in line with
the second part of the U-shaped rela-
tionship that was found for men in our
meta-analysis.

Our ﬁnding of a U-shaped relation-
ship between alcohol consumption and
type 2 diabetes risk is analogous with the
previously demonstrated relationship
with cardiovascular diseases (36,37) and
may partly share underlying mechanisms.
Moderate alcohol consumption is known
to increase HDL cholesterol concentra-
tion (38), whereas, at higher consump-
tion levels, body weight, triglyceride
concentration, and blood pressure in-
crease (39 – 42). Another plausible mech-
anism is through the anti-inﬂammatory
effect of alcohol (43,44). Enhanced insu-
lin sensitivity with lower plasma insulin
concentrations is another (and more type
2 diabetes–speciﬁc) plausible mechanism
because inverse and U-shaped relation-
ships between alcohol consumption and
insulin levels have been shown (41). In a
recent randomized controlled trial in
women without diabetes, alcohol con-
sumption of 30 g/day was shown to have
beneﬁcial effects on insulin and triglycer-
ide concentrations (45).

Our study has several potential limi-
tations. First, its quality fully depends on
that of the original studies included. Va-
lidity threats of those studies are directly
inherited. One of these threats is the mea-
surement error that is inevitable when us-
ing relatively simple methods to assess
alcohol consumption (46). Both differen-
tial and nondifferential misclassiﬁcation
of the amount of alcohol consumed at
baseline may have resulted in bias. The
misclassiﬁcation, on average, is expected
to be an underestimation of the amount of
alcohol consumed (47). Therefore, the
amount of alcohol consumption associ-
ated with the lowest risk of type 2 diabetes
in reality may be higher than reported. In
addition, one alcohol assessment at base-
line may not be a precise representation of
the average alcohol amount consumed

over the complete time at risk. Because
moderate consumers may have changed
to abstainers or heavy consumers, and
vice versa, it is likely that the magnitude
of the U-shaped relationship is underesti-
mated, as is shown to be the case for the
relationship between alcohol and mortal-
ity (48). In addition, the meta-analysis
does not give information on the impor-
tance of a stable pattern of alcohol con-
sumption on type 2 diabetes risk.
However, as has been demonstrated for
coronary heart disease before (49), Coni-
grave et al. (24) presumed that drinking
frequency is inversely associated with
type 2 diabetes risk. Because detailed in-
formation on the inﬂuence of the pattern
of consumption, including binge drink-
ing, was missing in all other studies, this
remains an important topic for further
investigations.

Second, 7 of the 15 studies did not
originally use nonconsumers as the refer-
ence category. In recalculating the RRs
from these studies relative to the category
of nonconsumers, the variance had to be
reestimated. Since the category of non-
consumers overall comprised 50% more
cases of type 2 diabetes than the reference
categories that were used in the original
publications, it is not likely that we un-
derestimated the variance.

Third, the so-called “sick quitter ef-
fect” may have caused bias (individuals
with preexisting disease stop drinking
and thereby cause the observed lower dis-
ease risk in drinkers [50]). However, sev-
eral large studies investigated this, and the
concerns are largely allayed (37). Like-
wise, the two studies included in the pres-
ent meta-analysis that reported results
for former drinkers and lifetime non-
consumers separately did not ﬁnd results
in accordance with the “sick quitter hy-
pothesis” (7,8).

Fourth, although most original stud-
ies adjusted for multiple potential con-
founders, residual confounding may have
resulted in the present ﬁndings. A meta-
analyses of observational studies has the
limitation of all observational data that
causal relationships cannot be estab-
lished, even when experimental work on
biological mechanisms is supporting the
hypotheses. Only long-term intervention
studies can determine the true beneﬁts or
adverse effects of alcohol consumption.
With the expectation of ⬎100 million
new cases of type 2 diabetes in the coming
two decades, and with the prevention of

DIABETES CARE, VOLUME 28, NUMBER 3, MARCH 2005

Alcohol and the risk of type 2 diabetes

type 2 diabetes now being recognized as
an urgent priority, attaining prevention is
the central challenge. There are calcula-
tions that 91% of new type 2 diabetic
cases could be attributed to the lack of
adherence to ﬁve lifestyle behaviors,
among which is the moderate consump-
tion of alcohol (26).

In conclusion, the present study sup-
ports the evidence of a considerably re-
duced risk of type 2 diabetes associated
with moderate but not with heavy alcohol
consumption in men and women with
low or high BMI.

Glycemic control and macrovascular disease in types 1
and 2 diabetes mellitus: Meta-analysis of
randomized trials
Christoph Stettler, MD,a Sabin Allemann,a,b Peter Ju¨ni, MD,a,c Carole A. Cull, PhD,d Rury R. Holman, MD,d
Matthias Egger, MD, MSc,a,c Stephan Kra¨henbu¨hl, MD,e and Peter Diem, MDb Bern, Switzerland; and Oxford, UK

Background Uncertainty persists concerning the effect of improved long-term glycemic control on macrovascular
disease in diabetes mellitus (DM).
Methods We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials comparing interventions
to improve glycemic control with conventional treatment in type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Outcomes included the incidence rate
ratios for any macrovascular event, cardiac events, stroke, and peripheral arterial disease, and the number needed to treat
intensively during 10 years to prevent one macrovascular event.
Results The analysis was based on 8 randomized comparisons including 1800 patients with type 1 DM (134
macrovascular events, 40 cardiac events, 88 peripheral vascular events, 6 cerebrovascular events, 11 293 person-years of
follow-up) and 6 comparisons including 4472 patients with type 2 DM (1587 macrovascular events, 1197 cardiac events,
87 peripheral vascular events, 303 cerebrovascular events, 43 607 person-years). Combined incidence rate ratios for any
macrovascular event were 0.38 (95% CI 0.26 -0.56) in type 1 and 0.81 (0.73 -0.91) in type 2 DM. In type 1 DM, effect was
mainly based on reduction of cardiac and peripheral vascular events and, in type 2 DM, due to reductions in stroke and
peripheral vascular events. Effects appear to be particularly important in younger patients with shorter duration of diabetes.
Conclusions Our data suggest that attempts to improve glycemic control reduce the incidence of macrovascular events
both in type 1 and type 2 DM. In absolute terms, benefits are comparable, although effects on specific manifestations of
macrovascular disease differ. (Am Heart J 2006;152:27-38.)

disease in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM).1,2 The
development of macrovascular complications, including
cardiac, cerebrovascular, and peripheral vascular com-
plications, is an important concern considering that a
substantial proportion of premature deaths in patients
with type 1 DM3 and most deaths in type 2 DM are
related to macrovascular disease.4

on microvascular complications, including retinopathy,
nephropathy, and neuropathy, have been documented
in several randomized studies published during the last
20 years. In patients with type 1 DM, this was conclu-
sively shown by DCCT5 and, in patients with type 2 DM,
by UKPDS.6 Although these and other studies5,7-13
prospectively recorded the occurrence of macrovascular
complications, they did not conclusively answer the
question whether improved glycemic control effectively
reduces macrovascular complications. By pooling data
from several studies, meta-analysis of the existing data
could clarify this issue.14 In collaboration with the
original investigators who provided additional informa-
tion on macrovascular outcomes, we did a comprehen-
sive systematic review and meta-analysis of all randomized
controlled trials in patients with type 1 and type 2 DM.

Methods
Literature search and eligibility criteria

We aimed to identify all randomized controlled comparisons

of improved glycemic control that assessed macrovascular
disease in types 1 and 2 DM. Using Cochrane methodology,15

28 Stettler et al

American Heart Journal
July 2006

we searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Con-
trolled Trials Register for relevant studies. We considered
studies in any language. Electronic searches were supple-
mented by hand-searching of reference lists, reviews, relevant
book chapters, conference abstracts, and specialist journals.
We evaluated each study for inclusion in the meta-analysis on
the basis of 6 criteria: (1) study design (randomized controlled
trial), (2) target population (general population of patients
with either type 1 or type 2 DM), (3) comparison of regimens
aiming to improve glycemic control (subcutaneous insulin
injections, insulin pump, oral antidiabetic agents, or a
combination of the previous) with conventional treatments,
(4) documentation of glycemic control by measurement of
glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), (5) follow-up of at least 2 years,
and (6) prospective recording of macrovascular events.
Two reviewers (CS, SA) independently assessed publications
for eligibility, with discrepancies being resolved in consulta-
tion with a third reviewer (PD).

Data extraction and outcome measures

Data on the characteristics of studies, patient populations,
and interventions were extracted independently by 2 inves-
tigators (CS and SA), with disagreements resolved by a third
reviewer (PD). This included the extraction of data on the
distribution of cardiac risk factors at study end (blood
pressure, lipid factors, body mass index, and smoking). All
relevant publications from a study were considered, includ-
ing, for example, early publications describing the study
design. Authors from all studies were sent a standardized data
extraction form and were asked to check the information
extracted from published articles and, where necessary, to
provide additional clinical and biochemical data. We defined
macrovascular end points as (1) cardiac events, including fatal
and nonfatal myocardial infarction (defined as evidence of
acute myocardial infarction confirmed by electrocardiogram
[ECG] and/or serum enzymes, confirmed nonacute myocardial
infarction based on serial reading of baseline and biennial
ECG and/or serum enzymes), any type of bypass graft and
percutaneous transluminal angioplasty, angina pectoris (de-
fined as evidence of ischemic heart disease confirmed by a
new ECG abnormality or an ECG that becomes abnormal on
exercise), congestive heart failure (based on clinical criteria,
eg, Kerley’s B lines, rales, raised jugular venous pressure, or
third heart sound), and death due to cardiac disease or
sudden death; (2) stroke (fatal and nonfatal, thrombotic or
hemorrhagic); and (3) peripheral vascular disease, including
intermittent claudication (defined as pain in leg(s) occurring
with exercise, no pain at rest, no tissue necrosis, clinical
impression combined with objective evidence [measurement
of ankle blood pressure, examination of pulse rates, Doppler,
angiography]), diabetes-related amputation of lower extremity,
any type of peripheral artery bypass or angioplasty, and death
due to peripheral arterial disease. The incidence of fatal or
nonfatal macrovascular events of any type was the primary
end point. Secondary outcomes included fatal or nonfatal
cardiac events, stroke, peripheral arterial disease, and macro-
vascular deaths.

Assessment of methodological quality

Two of us (CS and SA) independently assessed the adequacy

of the concealment of allocation of patients to treatment

groups, blinding of care providers and research staff ascer-
taining macrovascular outcomes, and the proportion of
randomized patients included in analyses.16 Disagreements
were resolved in discussion with a third reviewer (PJ).

Statistical analysis

We calculated the incidence of macrovascular events sepa-

rately for each treatment group by dividing the number of events
by the number of person-years of follow-up. For each compar-
ison and end point, the incidence rate ratio (IRR) was obtained
by dividing the incidence in the intensified treatment group by
the incidence in the control group. Comparisons with no
outcome events in either group were excluded from the
respective analysis. Comparisons with events only in one group
were analyzed by adding one half to all cells. We combined IRRs
in fixed-effects meta-analysis, assuming that the observed
variation in treatment effects in the different studies is entirely
due to sampling variation and that the underlying treatment
effect is the same in all study populations. The weight for each
study was calculated by using the inverse of the variance of the
estimated log IRR in the corresponding study (inverse variance
weighting). In addition, we calculated the I2 statistic, which
describes the percentage of total variation across studies that is
due to heterogeneity rather than chance: I 2 = 100%  ( Q   df)/
Q, where Q is the Cochran heterogeneity statistic and df is the
degrees of freedom.17 Mild heterogeneity will account for b 30%
of the variation, and pronounced heterogeneity will account
for substantially N50%. The number of patients that need to be
treated intensively to prevent one macrovascular event18 was
calculated by applying the combined IRRs to incidence rates
typical for conventionally treated patients. In sensitivity
analyses, we repeated calculations using random-effects models
(attributing increased weight to smaller comparisons) and did
tests of funnel plot asymmetry to assess for publication bias.19,20
The extent to which the effect of improved glycemic control
was modified by study-level variables was explored in univari-
able metaregression models.21 The following variables were
considered: reduction of HbA1c achieved with intensified
treatment, duration of DM, mean age at baseline, proportion
women, year of study begin, year of study reporting, and study
quality (concealment of allocation, blinding, and the proportion
of randomized patients included in analyses). Finally, we
repeated analyses excluding one study22 where the prevalence
of smoking was substantially higher in the intensive treatment
group. Results are presented as IRRs with 95% CIs and numbers
needed to treat (NNTs) to prevent one macrovascular event. All
analyses were performed using Stata version 8.2 (Stata Corpo-
ration, College Station, TX).

Results
Identification of eligible studies and comparisons

We screened 1438 reports and excluded 1313. The
remaining 125 reports, which reported on 14 different
studies, were retrieved for detailed evaluation. Ten
studies that included 14 randomized comparisons of
intensified and conventional treatment were included
(Figure 1). Eight comparisons had been performed in
patients with type 1 DM5,7,8,10 - 12 and 6 in patients
with type 2 DM.6,9,22,23 The DCCT in patients with

domized controlled trials.

type 1 DM5 and the Kumamoto study in patients with
type 2 DM9 included 2 parallel comparisons in patients
with and without diabetic complications (secondary
and primary prevention arms). The UKPDS contributed
3 comparisons: (1) comparison of an intensified
regimen based on sulfonylurea or insulin with con-
ventional treatment in nonoverweight patients
(bUKPDS 1Q in this article); (2) comparison of an
intensified regimen based primarily on sulfonylurea or
insulin with conventional treatment in overweight
patients (N120% of ideal body weight, bUKPDS 2Q); and
(3) comparison of intensified metformin-based regimen
with conventional treatment in overweight patients
(b UKPDS 3Q ). There was overlap in groups receiving
conventional treatment in UKPDS 2 and 3; this was

taken into account in the meta-analysis by reducing
the weight of the respective groups.

Characteristics of trials, patients, and interventions

Nine comparisons were performed in

Europe,6-8,10-12,23 3 in North America,5,22 and 2 in Asia.9
Mean follow-up ranged from 2.0 to 8.0 years in patients
with type 1 DM and from 2.3 to 10.7 years in type 2
DM. Appropriate methods of allocation concealment
were described for 8 comparisons.5,8,11,12,24 For
7 comparisons, the degree of blinding of outcome
assessors remained unclear.7-10,12 Eleven comparisons
had been analyzed according to the intention-to-treat
principle.5-7,9,12,22,23 In the remaining 3, the proportion
of patients excluded from the analysis ranged from
5.4% to 13.6%.

The 14 randomized comparisons included a total of
6272 patients, 1800 patients with type 1 DM (11 293
person-years of follow-up) and 4472 patients with type
2 DM (43 607 person-years of follow-up). Study pop-
ulations were heterogeneous, both in type 1 and type 2
DM, with a range of mean ages and durations of DM at
baseline (Table I). In type 1 DM, intensified treatment
typically consisted of multiple injection therapy or
continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion using a
pump, with intensive self-monitoring of blood glucose.
Conventional treatment was based on 1 to 3 injections,
with or without occasional blood glucose monitoring.
In type 2 DM, attempts to improve glycemic control
consisted of subcutaneous insulin injections or hypo-
glycemic agents combined with insulin injections,
generally with blood glucose monitoring, whereas for
conventional treatment, the number of insulin injec-
tions was either reduced or treatment was with
hypoglycemic agents or diet alone, with less intensive
blood glucose monitoring. Mean baseline HbA1c ranged
from 8.8% to 11.8% in patients with type 1 DM and
from 7.0% to 9.5% in type 2 DM (Table II). At the
conclusion of studies, differences in HbA1c between
intensified and conventional treatment groups ranged
from  0.5% to  1.9% in type 1 and from  0.3% to
 2.2% in type 2 DM. The prevalence of cardiac risk
factors was similar between treatment groups
(Table III), with one exception: in the Veterans Affairs
study,22 smoking was more prevalent in the intensive
group, 23% versus 13% at baseline and 21% versus 8%
at study end.

Macrovascular events and mortality

Additional outcome data were obtained for 12

comparisons.5-10,12,22,23 A total of 134 macrovascular
events of any type were recorded in type 1 DM and
1587 events in type 2 DM. The number of events and
person years of follow-up is shown in Table IV. The
results from fixed-effects meta-analyses are shown in
Figure 2 and Table V. Combined IRRs were 0.38

and 0.58 (0.38-0.89) in type 2 DM ( P = .22 for
difference). Six strokes were observed in type 1 and 303
in type 2 DM. Combined IRRs were 0.34 (0.05-2.57) and
0.58 (0.46-0.74), respectively ( P = .54 for difference).
Figure 3 summarizes effect estimates for any macro-
vascular event and for cardiac, peripheral vascular, and
stroke events by type of DM. In 3 studies7,10,11 (all in
patients with type 1 DM), no macrovascular deaths
occurred. Nine deaths occurred in type 1 DM and 441
in type 2 DM. Combined IRRs were comparable: 0.89
(0.27 to 2.98) and 0.88 (0.72 to 1.08) for type 1 and
2 DM, respectively.

Numbers needed to treat to prevent one
macrovascular event

The incidence of macrovascular events in conven-

tionally treated patients with type 1 DM ranged from
0.6 per 100 person-years in the MCSG trial12 to 4.7 in
the study of Feldt-Rasmussen et al.7 For calculation of
NNTs, we assumed a typical incidence of 1 per 100
person-years. In conventionally treated patients with
type 2 DM, incidences were more heterogeneous and
ranged from 1.3 per 100 person-years in the Kuma-
moto secondary intervention arm9 to 13.7 in the
Veterans Affairs study.22 We calculated NNTs assuming
typical incidences of 4 per 100 person-years (lower
risk) and 8 per 100 person-years (higher risk). Using
the IRRs from our meta-analysis (0.38 for type 1 DM
and 0.81 for type 2 DM), the numbers of patients that
need to receive intensified treatment for 10 years to
prevent one macrovascular event were 16 for type 1
DM, 14 for low-risk type 2 DM, and 7 for high-risk
type 2 DM.

Sensitivity and metaregression analyses

Combined IRRs from random-effects models were
similar to those from the fixed-effects models. There
was little evidence of funnel plot asymmetry in both
types of DM ( P N .3 for all end points). In type 1 DM,
the reduction in the risk for macrovascular events
associated with improved glycemic control was greater
in studies that achieved larger reductions in HbA1c
levels ( P = .050). No such interaction was evident for
type 2 DM. In type 2 DM, the beneficial effect of
improved glycemic control decreased with longer
diabetes duration ( P = .040). Similarly, older age of
study populations was associated with smaller effect
( P = .024). A comparable trend was found for type 1
DM, although it did not reach statistical significance.
There was little evidence for associations with the
proportion of women or dimensions of study quality
and the inclusion of the year of study begin or
reporting did not significantly influence the results.
Finally, when excluding the Veterans Affairs study,22
the IRR for macrovascular event of any type was 0.79
(95% CI 0.71- 0.88).

Discussion

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we found
that improved glycemic control translated into substantial
reductions in macrovascular risk in type 1 DM while
producing a smaller reduction in patients with type 2 DM.
In type 1 DM, important beneficial effects were evident
for cardiac and peripheral vascular events. In type 2 DM,
substantial effects were observed for peripheral vascular
disease and stroke, whereas cardiac events were not

found to be reduced significantly. Of note, the number of
patients that need to be treated to prevent one macro-
vascular event (NNT) was lower for type 2 DM compared
with type 1 DM. This reflects a higher incidence of

macrovascular events in patients with type 2 DM and
thereby a higher a priori risk. Interestingly, improved
glycemic control was particularly beneficial in younger
patients with shorter diabetes duration.

Strengths and limitations

This is the first systematic review and meta-analysis

including all randomized controlled trials done in
patients with type 1 and type 2 DM. The effects of

improved glycemic control could thus be compared
between the 2 types of DM within the same review
framework, using identical definitions and methodology.
Previous reviews were restricted to one type of DM and

not directly comparable.25,26 Our study was based on a
comprehensive literature search. Original investigators
checked the extracted data and contributed additional
information. We acknowledge that the inclusion of large
studies as DCCT in type 1 DM and UKPDS in type 2 DM
could potentially have led to distortion of the results. As
a consequence, whenever a study included several

randomized comparisons, we included them separately
to minimize individual weight and to maximize the
power to identify factors that may modify the effect of
improved glycemic control. For example, the separate
inclusion of the primary and secondary prevention
cohorts from the DCCT5 and Kumamoto9 studies meant
that the power to detect a possible interaction between

diabetes duration and the effect of improved glycemic
control was enhanced. Random-effects model, attribut-
ing increased weight to smaller comparisons, revealed
very comparable IRRs.

Although our study represents the largest body of
evidence from randomized trials ever assembled to

address this issue, the patients included in these trials
may not be representative of patients with DM at large.
Trials in type 1 DM enrolled young patients, most of
them in their twenties and thirties, who were at low risk
for macrovascular events. Trial participants with type 2
DM were also quite young, typically in their fifties.

36 Stettler et al

Women were enrolled in all but one trial, but they
generally were in the minority. The exclusion of women
and older persons from trials has been documented
previously, for example, in trials of statins.27 It is difficult
to judge whether the risk reductions observed in this
meta-analysis are applicable to older patients and
patients with longer duration of DM. We found that
reductions in macrovascular risk tended to decrease
with increasing age and duration of DM, particularly in
type 2 DM, but in absolute terms, benefits may be as
great or greater because of the increased macrovascular
risk in the elderly. Finally, the duration of follow-up was
generally b10 years, which may be insufficient if
several years of treatment are required for effects to
materialize fully.

Relation to other studies

Epidemiological studies have shown that the degree of

blood glucose control achieved in patients with DM is
associated with cardiac risk. Indeed, a recent meta-
analysis of observational studies showed an increase in
cardiac risk with increasing levels of HbA1c both in
patients with type 1 and type 2 DM.28 Epidemiological
analyses of the UKPDS showed a close relationship
between HbA1c and macrovascular risk.29 In type 1 DM,
the present analysis confirms an association of HbA1c
with macrovascular complications. Compared with a
previous meta-analysis in patients with type 1 DM,26 the
present analysis included a larger number of studies and
macrovascular events. In contrast to the aforementioned
reports, metaregression analysis did not reveal a signif-
icant dependency of macrovascular risk on HbA1c in
type 2 DM. On one hand, this discrepancy could be due
to statistical reasons in the present analysis and to the
limitations of metaregression technique (analysis in type
2 DM only based on 6 comparisons, differences of HbA1c
lying in a close range). On the other hand, average
changes in HbA1c on study level might not entirely
reflect efforts to improve glycemic control. The
corresponding treatment strategies could nevertheless
have beneficial effects on vascular end points not
detected solely by measurement of HbA1c (eg, reduction
of postprandial hyperglycemia as a significant vascular
risk factor as discussed hereinafter). In contrast to a
broad analysis of interventions to prevent cardiac events
in patients with type 2 DM,25 we excluded the DIGAMI
trial,30 which showed that insulin-glucose infusion
followed by a multidose insulin regimen improved
prognosis in diabetic patients with acute myocardial
infarction. The second DIGAMI trial31 did not confirm a
positive effect of intensified glycemic control in the
setting of acute myocardial infarction. Recently, a
U-shaped relationship of glycemic control with out-
comes in acute coronary syndrome and myocardial
infarction has been shown.32 In contrast to these studies
focusing on glycemic control in the setting of acute

myocardial infarction, the present meta-analysis investi-
gated the effect of improved long-term glycemic control
in a general diabetic population.

Possible mechanisms

What factors could explain the finding that, in type 2
DM, improved glycemic control leads to a more modest
reduction of macrovascular events and does not appear
to have a significant impact on cardiac events? First, the
metabolic abnormalities typical for type 2 DM not only
lead to insulin resistance and hyperglycemia but also to
dyslipidemia, arterial hypertension, endothelial dysfunc-
tion, and increased platelet activity and coagulability.33
Improving blood glucose control without also address-
ing the other abnormalities, most importantly hyper-
tension, dyslipidemia, and platelet hyperactivity, may
therefore produce only limited benefit. Indeed, recent
randomized trials of multifactorial interventions, includ-
ing the tight blood pressure control arm of the UKPDS,
showed substantial reductions in cardiac events.29,34 Of
note, in our analysis, the distribution of cardiac risk
factors was similar both after randomization and at the
conclusion of studies. One exception was the Veterans
Affairs study22 where smoking was more prevalent in
the intensive treatment group. This imbalance, com-
bined with the long duration of diabetes in this study
population, may explain the anomalous results of this
trial. Interventions that reduce insulin resistance have
been shown to have antiatherogenic effects,35-38 and this
may have produced the somewhat larger benefits seen
in overweight UKPDS patients randomized to metfor-
min. In patients with type 1 DM, particularly younger
patients, other macrovascular risk factors are less
common and the nonenzymatic glycation of proteins
and lipids, and the resulting formation of advanced
glycation end products may thus be the predominant
mechanism in the development of macrovascular and
microvascular disease.39,40

Second, in trials in type 1 DM, the intensified regimen

generally included basal and prandial insulin (multiple
insulin injections or continuous subcutaneous insulin
injection), which will have reduced postprandial as well
as basal hyperglycemia. Postchallenge hyperglycemia is
strongly associated with macrovascular complications.
For example, in the DECODE study,41 it was the
postload blood glucose concentration that was inde-
pendently associated with mortality. Furthermore, a post
hoc analysis of the STOP-NIDDM trial42 showed that
decreasing postprandial hyperglycemia with the
a-glucosidase inhibitor acarbose reduced cardiac risk in
patients with impaired glucose tolerance. Intensified
treatment regimens in type 2 DM focused mainly on
normalizing basal blood glucose. The better control of
postprandial hyperglycemia in type 1 DM may thus have
contributed to the differences observed between the
2 types of DM.

Implications and conclusions

Our results suggest that, in type 1 DM, glycemic

control is the essential treatment strategy leading not
only to the well-documented reduction of microvascular
complications but also to a substantial reduction of
macrovascular disease. In patients with type 2 DM,
improved glycemic control is associated with a more
modest reduction in macrovascular complications. In
these patients, the prevention of cardiac events must be
effected by means of a broader treatment strategy,
including antihypertensive, lipid-lowering, and platelet-
inhibiting measures. The improvement of glycemic
control itself appears to be particularly effective in
younger patients with shorter duration of the disease.
Ongoing studies will help to better define the benefits
and risks of improved blood glucose control in type 2
DM, including the large ACCORD trial.43

Abstract
Objective To determine whether individual fruits are differentially
associated with risk of type 2 diabetes.
Design Prospective longitudinal cohort study.
Setting Health professionals in the United States.
Participants 66 105 women from the Nurses’ Health Study (1984-2008),
85 104 women from the Nurses’ Health Study II (1991-2009), and 36
173 men from the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (1986-2008)
who were free of major chronic diseases at baseline in these studies.
Main outcome measure Incident cases of type 2 diabetes, identified
through self report and confirmed by supplementary questionnaires.
Results During 3 464 641 person years of follow-up, 12 198 participants
developed type 2 diabetes. After adjustment for personal, lifestyle, and
dietary risk factors of diabetes, the pooled hazard ratio of type 2 diabetes
for every three servings/week of total whole fruit consumption was 0.98
(95% confidence interval 0.96 to 0.99). With mutual adjustment of
individual fruits, the pooled hazard ratios of type 2 diabetes for every
three servings/week were 0.74 (0.66 to 0.83) for blueberries, 0.88 (0.83
to 0.93) for grapes and raisins, 0.89 (0.79 to 1.01) for prunes, 0.93 (0.90
to 0.96) for apples and pears, 0.95 (0.91 to 0.98) for bananas, 0.95 (0.91
to 0.99) for grapefruit, 0.97 (0.92 to 1.02) for peaches, plums, and
apricots, 0.99 (0.95 to 1.03) for oranges, 1.03 (0.96 to 1.10) for
strawberries, and 1.10 (1.02 to 1.18) for cantaloupe. The pooled hazard
ratio for the same increment in fruit juice consumption was 1.08 (1.05
to 1.11). The associations with risk of type 2 diabetes differed significantly
among individual fruits (P<0.001 in all cohorts).

Conclusion Our findings suggest the presence of heterogeneity in the
associations between individual fruit consumption and risk of type 2
diabetes. Greater consumption of specific whole fruits, particularly
blueberries, grapes, and apples, is significantly associated with a lower
risk of type 2 diabetes, whereas greater consumption of fruit juice is
associated with a higher risk.
Introduction
Fruits are rich in fibre, antioxidants, and phytochemicals that
may have beneficial health effects. Increasing fruit consumption
has been recommended for the primary prevention of many
chronic diseases, including type 2 diabetes,1 although
epidemiologic studies have generated somewhat mixed results
regarding the link with risk of type 2 diabetes.2-10 The
inconsistency among these studies may be explained by
differences in types of fruits consumed in different study
populations as well as difference in participants’ characteristics,
study design, and assessment methods, although a meta-analysis
did not show that the associations differed by sex, study design,
or location.10 Furthermore, in a recent study, the greater variety,
but not quantity, of fruits consumed was associated with a lower
risk of type 2 diabetes.4 This finding suggested that individual
fruits might not be equally associated with risk of type 2 diabetes
in that fruits have highly variable contents of fibre, antioxidants,
other nutrients, and phytochemicals that jointly may influence
the risk.11 12 Additionally, the glycemic index, which represents
the quality of carbohydrate, or glycemic load, which represents
the quality and quantity of carbohydrate and their interaction,
vary substantially for individual fruits.13

RESEARCH

We examined the associations of individual fruit consumption
in relation to risk of type 2 diabetes using data from three
prospective cohort studies in US adults. Moreover, we estimated
substitution effects of individual fruits for fruit juice in relation
to risk of type 2 diabetes. Secondarily, we examined the
associations of fruit groups based on their glycemic index and
glycemic load values with risk of type 2 diabetes.
Methods
Study population
We used data from the Nurses’ Health Study (established in
1976; n=121 700), the Nurses’ Health Study II (established in
1989; n=116 671), and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study
(established in 1986; n=51 529). These cohort studies are
discussed in detail elsewhere.14-16 Every two years since baseline,
follow-up questionnaires have been mailed to the participants
to collect and update information on lifestyle practices and
occurrence of chronic diseases. In all three cohorts the follow-up
rates are approximately 90%.
We excluded participants who reported a diagnosis of diabetes
(including types 1 and 2 and gestational diabetes), cardiovascular
disease, or cancer at baseline (n=10 134 for the Nurses’ Health
Study, 6155 for the Nurses’ Health Study II, and 6707 for the
Health Professionals Follow-up Study), those who had missing
data for individual fruits and fruit juice or an unusual level of
total energy intake (<500 or >3500 kcal/day for the Nurses’
Health Study and the Nurses’ Health Study II and <800 or >4200
kcal/day for the Health Professionals Follow-up Study) (n=4765
for the Nurses’ Health Study, 5647 for the Nurses’ Health Study
II, and 5750 for the Health Professionals Follow-up Study),
those whose diagnosis date of type 2 diabetes was unclear
(n=200 for Health Professionals Follow-up Study), and those
who completed only the baseline questionnaire (n=719 for the
Nurses’ Health Study, 699 for the Nurses’ Health Study II, and
1103 for the Health Professionals Follow-up Study). After
excluding these participants, 66 105 women in the Nurses’
Health Study, 85 104 women in the Nurses’ Health Study II,
and 36 173 men in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study
were available for the analysis.
Assessment of fruit consumption
In 1984 a 118 item food frequency questionnaire was sent to
the participants of the Nurses’ Health Study to assess their
habitual diet in the past year. In 1986 and every four years
thereafter, a similar but expanded questionnaire was sent to the
participants to update their dietary information. The expanded
questionnaire was also administered every four years to assess
diet among the participants in the Health Professionals
Follow-up Study since 1986 and those in the Nurses’ Health
Study II since 1991. In all food frequency questionnaires we
asked the participants how often, on average, they consumed
each food in a standard portion size. Participants could choose
from nine possible responses, ranging from “never, or less than
once per month” to “six or more times per day.” We consistently
asked about 10 individual fruits since baseline: grapes or raisins;
peaches, plums, or apricots; prunes; bananas; cantaloupe; apples
or pears; oranges; grapefruit; strawberries; and blueberries. We
calculated total whole fruit consumption by summing the
consumption levels of the 10 individual fruits and watermelon,
which we inquired about sporadically during follow-up. Fruit
juice included apple, orange, grapefruit, and other juices. The
food frequency questionnaires were validated against diet
records among 173 participants in the Nurses’ Health Study in
1980 and 127 participants in the Health Professionals Follow-up

Study in 1986.17-19 Corrected correlation coefficients between
food frequency questionnaire and diet record assessments of
individual fruit consumption were 0.80 for apples, 0.79 for
bananas, and 0.74 for oranges in women,17 and 0.67 for total
whole fruits, 0.76 for fruit juice, 0.95 for bananas, 0.84 for
grapefruit, 0.76 for oranges, 0.70 for apples and pears, 0.59 for
raisins and grapes, and 0.38 for strawberries in men.18 19 For
some individual fruits, the corrected correlation coefficients
were not available owing to large within person variability in
the comparison methods.
Assessment of covariates
In the follow-up questionnaires administered every two years,
we inquired and updated information on anthropometric and
lifestyle factors for chronic diseases, including body height and
weight, cigarette smoking, physical activity, multivitamin use,
and family history of diabetes. Among participants in the
Nurses’ Health Study and Nurses’ Health Study II, we
ascertained menopausal status, post-menopausal hormone use,
and oral contraceptive use (Nurses’ Health Study II only).
Estimates of total physical activity levels were calculated by
multiplying the energy expenditure in metabolic equivalent
tasks (METs) measured in hours per week of each activity by
hours spent on the activity and summing the values of all
activities. Each MET hour is the caloric need per kilogram of
body weight per hour of an activity, divided by the caloric need
per kilogram of weight per hour at rest. Based on the food
frequency questionnaire, we derived a score of the alternate
healthy eating index, an indicator of adherence to healthy eating
behavior, described in detail elsewhere.20 In brief, the alternate
healthy eating index score summarizes the consumption of 11
foods or nutrients (including consumption of vegetables, fruits,
whole grains, sugar sweetened beverages and fruit juice, nuts
and legumes, red and processed meat, trans fat, long chain n-3
fat, polyunsaturated fat, sodium, and alcohol). Each component
was scored on a scale of 0 to 10. In the current analysis, we
excluded fruits and fruit juice when calculating the alternate
healthy eating index score.
Assessment of diabetes and death
In all three cohorts, to inquire about symptoms, diagnostic tests,
and diabetes drug use we mailed a supplementary questionnaire
to participants who reported physician diagnosed diabetes in
the follow-up questionnaires. A type 2 diabetes diagnosis was
confirmed if participants met at least one of the following
National Diabetes Data Group criteria21: one or more classic
symptoms (excessive thirst, polyuria, weight loss, and hunger)
plus raised blood glucose levels (fasting levels ≥140 mg/dL
(7.8 mmol/L), random blood levels ≥200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L),
and/or two hour blood glucose levels ≥200 mg/dL during oral
glucose tolerance testing), raised blood glucose levels on two
different occasions in the absence of symptoms, or treatment
with antidiabetic drugs (insulin or oral antidiabetic agent). The
diagnostic criteria changed in June 1998 and a fasting blood
glucose level of 126 mg/dL (7.0 mmol/L) instead of 140 mg/dL
was considered the threshold for the diagnosis of diabetes.22 The
validity of the supplementary questionnaire for the diagnosis
of diabetes has been examined in validation studies.23 24 Of 62
self reported cases of type 2 diabetes randomly selected in the
Nurses’ Health Study, 61 (98%) were confirmed after an
endocrinologist reviewed the medical records without the
information from the supplementary questionnaire23; and in the
Health Professionals Follow-up Study, 57 of 59 self reported
cases of type 2 diabetes (97%) were confirmed by a review of
medical records.24

RESEARCH

Deaths were identified by reports from next of kin or postal
authorities, or by searching the national death index. At least
98% of deaths were identified among the participants.25
Statistical analysis
We calculated each participant’s person years from the return
date of the baseline food frequency questionnaire to the date of
the type 2 diabetes diagnosis, date of death, last return of a valid
follow-up questionnaire, or end of follow-up (2008 for the
Nurses’ Health Study and Health Professionals Follow-up Study,
or 2009 for the Nurses’ Health Study II), whichever came first.
To represent long term dietary intake and minimize within
person variation, we calculated and used the cumulative average
of dietary intake based on valid assessments from baseline to
the end of follow-up.26 To minimize the effects of chronic
diseases diagnosed during follow-up on subsequent diet, we
stopped updating dietary information after self reported
diagnosis of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, gestational
diabetes, cardiovascular disease, or cancer, since these chronic
diseases may lead to changes of fruit consumption levels in the
cohorts.27 To reduce the effect of potential outliers and to pool
the results from the three cohorts, we used the same cut-off
points to categorize consumption levels in these studies. The
highest two consumption levels were combined for prunes,
cantaloupe, and blueberries owing to the small number of
participants with high consumption levels of these fruits.
To minimize missing covariates, we replaced missing data on
body mass index and physical activity with the last valid values.
For missing data on body mass index and physical activity at
baseline, we created a dummy variable when making categories
for these two continuous covariates. Similarly, we also used
missing indicator variables to include participants with missing
categorical variables, including cigarette smoking, oral
contraceptive use (Nurses’ Health Study II only), menopausal
status, and post-menopausal hormone use. The overall
percentages of missing data for body mass index and physical
activity were, respectively, 6.8% and 9.5% in the Nurses’ Health
Study, 6.7% and 8.5% in the Nurses’ Health Study II, and 12.8%
and 14.0% in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study. The
overall percentages of missing values during follow-up ranged
from 0.6% (for cigarette smoking) to 5.1% (for menopausal
status and post-menopausal hormone use) in the Nurses’ Health
Study, from 0.3% (for cigarette smoking) to 4.7% (for
menopausal status and post-menopausal hormone use) in the
Nurses’ Health Study II, and from 0.1% (for physical activity)
to 12.2% (for cigarette smoking) in the Health Professionals
Follow-up Study.
Using Cox proportional hazard regression, we estimated the
hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals of type 2 diabetes
for fruit consumption. We tested the proportional hazard
assumption by including interaction terms between individual
fruit consumption and duration of follow-up, and the assumption
was unlikely violated (P>0.05 for all tests). We examined linear
trend by modelling the median values for fruit consumption
categories as a continuous variable. Using a fixed effects model,
we pooled multivariable adjusted hazard ratios from three
cohorts, and we used the Cochrane Q statistic and the I2 statistic
to examine the heterogeneity of associations among the cohorts.
To examine whether the associations with risk of type 2 diabetes
were heterogeneous among individual fruits, we fitted two fully
adjusted models: one with total fruit consumption and the other
with total fruit consumption plus consumption of individual
fruits excluding oranges (which had the most similar association
as the total fruit consumption) to avoid over-fitting. Then we

used the likelihood ratio test to examine whether the model
including individual fruits had better fit than that including total
fruit consumption only.
We also estimated potential effects of substituting specific fruit
consumption for fruit juice consumption by examining the
median values for consumption categories of individual fruits
and fruit juice in the same multivariate model; the hazard ratios
and 95% confidence intervals for substitution effects were
calculated based on the differences in point estimates, and the
variance and covariance for the regression coefficients of
specific fruits and fruit juice.28 To examine the robustness of
our findings, we also conducted four sensitivity analyses:
evaluating the influence of adjustment for major dietary
variables including polyunsaturated to saturated fat ratio, and
intakes of trans fat, red meat, fish, whole grains, sugar sweetened
beverages, coffee, and nuts (all in fifths) instead of the modified
alternate healthy eating index score; adjusting for baseline body
mass index instead of updated body mass index to estimate the
impact of potential over-adjustment; using baseline consumption
levels as an exposure instead of cumulative average of intake
levels; and stopping updating diet after diagnosis of gestational
diabetes, cardiovascular disease, or cancer only when calculating
the cumulative averages.
We further examined whether the associations of individual
fruit consumption with risk of type 2 diabetes depended on the
glycemic index/glycemic load values of fruits. We calculated
the glycemic load values per serving for individual fruits based
on the glycemic index values from the international glycemic
index database13 and the amount of carbohydrate in fruits from
the USDA nutritional database11 (see supplementary table 1).
We categorized individual fruits into three groups based on their
glycemic load values per serving: prunes, bananas, grapes,
raisins, apples, and pears for high glycemic load fruits (glycemic
load 8.1-19.2); cantaloupe, blueberries, and oranges for moderate
glycemic load fruits (5.7-8.0); and peaches, plums, apricots,
strawberries, and grapefruit for low glycemic load fruits
(1.3-5.6). In terms of the categorization of fruits by the glycemic
index values, high glycemic index fruits included cantaloupe,
bananas, grapes, raisins (glycemic index 60-70); moderate
glycemic index fruits included prunes, blueberries, and
grapefruit (47-59); and low glycemic index fruits included
apples, pears, oranges, peaches, plums, apricots, and strawberries
(34-46). Moreover, to estimate the degree to which the observed
associations were explained by flavonoid intake, in a secondary
analysis we further adjusted for intake of flavonoid subtypes
(flavonols, flavones, flavanones, flavan-3-ols, and anthocyanins).
The analysis was stratified jointly by age and calendar year and
adjusted for body mass index (kg/m2; <23, 23.0-24.9, 25.0-26.9,
27.0-28.9, 29.0-30.9, 31.0-32.9, 33.0-34.9, 35.0-36.9, 37.0-38.9,
39.0-40.9, 41.0-42.9, 43.0-44.9, ≥45.0, or missing), ethnicity
(white, African-American, Hispanic, or Asian), physical activity
(MET hours/week; <3, 3.0-8.9, 9.0-17.9, 18.0-26.9, ≥27.0, or
missing), cigarette smoking (never, former, currently smoke
1-14 cigarettes/day, currently smoke 15-24 cigarettes/day, or
currently smoke ≥25 cigarettes/day, or missing), multivitamin
use (yes or no), family history of diabetes (yes or no),
menopausal status and post-menopausal hormone use
(premenopause, post-menopause (never, former, or current
hormone use), or missing) (for women), oral contraceptive use
(yes, no, or missing) (Nurses’ Health Study II only), total energy
intake (kcal/day), fruit juice consumption (fifths), and the
modified alternate healthy eating index score (fifths).20 When
examining the association for total whole fruit, we included
total fruit consumption in the multivariate model without further
adjusting for individual fruits. Likewise, when examining the

associations for individual fruits or fruit groups based on their
glycemic index/glycemic load values, we included consumption
levels of all other individual fruits or fruit groups instead of
total fruit consumption in the final model.
Statistical analyses were performed with SAS 9.2. All P values
were two sided, and statistical significance was defined as
P<0.05.
Results
During 3 464 641 person years of follow-up, 12 198 participants
developed type 2 diabetes (Nurses’ Health Study: 6358 cases/1
394 127 person years; Nurses’ Health Study II: 3153 cases/1
416 111 person years; Health Professionals Follow-up Study:
2687 cases/654 403 person years). The rate of loss to follow-up
was low and similar between extreme comparison groups of
total fruit consumption levels: the average rate of loss to
follow-up for each two year follow-up cycle was 0.8% for <4
servings/week and 0.7% for ≥3 servings/day of total fruit
consumption in the Nurses’ Health Study. These values were
0.1% and 0.1% in the Nurses’ Health Study II and 1.0% and
1.1% in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study, respectively.
In all three cohorts, total whole fruit consumption was positively
correlated with age, physical activity, multivitamin use, total
energy intake, fruit juice consumption, and the modified
alternate health eating index score, and was inversely associated
with body mass index and current smoking (table 1⇓). Whole
fruit consumption was associated with an increased probability
of using post-menopausal hormones in the Nurses’ Health Study
and with a reduced probability of using oral contraceptives in
the Nurses’ Health Study II. Individual fruits were correlated
with each other weakly to moderately; the highest Spearman
correlation coefficients were 0.44 between apples and oranges
in the Nurses’ Health Study, 0.47 between strawberries and
peaches in the Nurses’ Health Study II, and 0.48 between
strawberries and blueberries in the Health Professionals
Follow-up Study (see supplementary table 2). The Spearman
correlation coefficients for total whole fruits in relation to the
modified alternate healthy eating index score were 0.22 for the
Nurses’ Health Study, 0.29 for the Nurses’ Health Study II, and
0.28 for the Health Professionals Follow-up Study; those for
individual fruits ranged from 0.09 (for bananas) to 0.23 (for
apples and pears) in the Nurses’ Health Study, from 0.13 (for
bananas) to 0.24 (for apples and pears) in the Nurses’ Health
Study II, and from 0.09 (for peaches, plums, and apricots) to
0.24 (for apples and pears) in the Health Professionals Follow-up
Study.
Total whole fruit consumption was weakly associated with a
lower risk of type 2 diabetes: the hazard ratio (95% confidence
interval) of type 2 diabetes for every three servings/week of
whole fruit consumption was 0.98 (0.96 to 0.99) (table 2⇓). In
the age adjusted model, each individual fruit consumption was
inversely associated with risk of type 2 diabetes in all cohorts
(all P<0.001) (see supplementary table 3). Adjustment for
personal factors, lifestyle, fruit juice consumption, and the
modified alternate health eating index score attenuated these
associations. The inverse association for cantaloupe consumption
was no longer statistically significant after multivariable
adjustments of the aforementioned covariates. Further
adjustment for other individual fruit consumption changed the
associations to various degrees (table 3⇓). The inverse
associations for grapes and blueberries were attenuated, albeit
remaining statistically significant. In contrast, associations for
strawberries were attenuated toward the null, and cantaloupe
consumption was associated with an increased risk of type 2

diabetes after adjustment for other individual fruits. For every
three servings/week, the pooled hazard ratios (95% confidence
intervals) of risk for type 2 diabetes was 0.74 (0.66 to 0.83) for
blueberries, 0.88 (0.83 to 0.93) for grapes and raisins, 0.93 (0.90
to 0.96) for apples and pears, 0.95 (0.91 to 0.98) for bananas,
and 0.95 (0.91 to 0.99) for grapefruit. In contrast, the pooled
hazard ratio (95% confidence interval) of risk for type 2 diabetes
for the same increment in cantaloupe consumption was 1.10
(1.02 to 1.18). A test for heterogeneity among three cohorts was
significant for the associations of bananas and strawberries (P
for heterogeneity <0.001 for bananas and 0.01 for strawberries).
In the Nurses’ Health Study II and Health Professionals
Follow-up Study, banana consumption was associated with a
lower risk of type 2 diabetes, whereas in the Nurses’ Health
Study a non-significant positive association was found. The
association for strawberry consumption was significantly
positive in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study but was
non-significant and inverse in the Nurses’ Health Study. Further
adjustment for intake levels of flavonoid subtypes (flavonols,
flavones, flavanones, flavan-3-ols, and anthocyanins) in the
final model did not appreciably attenuate the associations for
individual fruits (see supplementary table 4).
The goodness of fit of model was significantly improved by
adding consumption of individual fruits to the model with total
whole fruit consumption and other covariates (P<0.001 for
likelihood ratio test in each cohort), indicating that heterogeneity
in the associations with risk of type 2 diabetes among individual
fruits was significant.
In the sensitivity analyses, the associations for individual fruits
did not change appreciably with adjustment for major dietary
factors instead of the modified alternate healthy eating index
score, or using baseline consumption levels of individual fruits
instead of cumulative average of intake levels (see
supplementary table 5). When we adjusted for baseline body
mass index instead of updated body mass index or stopped
updating diet after diagnosis of gestational diabetes,
cardiovascular disease, or cancer when calculating the
cumulative average of dietary intake, the inverse associations
became weaker, although the associations for blueberries, grapes
and raisins, and apples and pears remained statistically
significant.
In the secondary analysis examining the associations between
fruit consumption and risk of type 2 diabetes by glycemic
index/glycemic load values of fruits, greater consumption of
high glycemic load fruits was associated with a lower risk of
type 2 diabetes, but not moderate and low glycemic load fruits
(table 4⇓). In contrast, greater consumption of moderate
glycemic index fruits, but not high and low glycemic index
fruits, was inversely associated with risk of type 2 diabetes.
Fruit juice consumption was associated with an increased risk
of type 2 diabetes. The associations for low glycemic load fruits
were heterogeneous among cohorts (P for heterogeneity =0.04):
a significant, inverse association was found in the Nurses’ Health
Study, but not in the other two cohorts.
Replacing each three servings/week of fruit juice consumption
with the same amount of total or individual whole fruits, the
risk of type 2 diabetes in the pooled analysis was 7% (95%
confidence interval 4% to 9%) lower for total whole fruits, 33%
(24% to 40%) lower for blueberries, 19% (14% to 24%) lower
for grapes and raisins, 14% (11% to 18%) lower for apples and
pears, 13% (9% to 16%) lower for bananas, and 12% (8% to
17%) lower for grapefruit after adjustment for personal factors,
lifestyle, and the modified alternate health eating index score
(figure⇓). Additionally, we found that replacing fruit juice with
oranges, peaches, plums, and apricots was also associated with

a lower risk of type 2 diabetes: 18% (8% to 28%) lower for
prunes, 11% (5% to 16%) lower for peaches, plums, and
apricots, and 8% (4% to 12%) lower for oranges.
Discussion
In three prospective cohorts of US men and women, we found
that the associations with risk of type 2 diabetes differed
significantly among individual fruits: greater consumption of
blueberries, grapes, apples, bananas, and grapefruit were
significantly associated with a reduced risk of type 2 diabetes.
Most of these associations were quite consistent among three
cohorts. Additionally, differences in the glycemic
index/glycemic load values of fruits did not account for the
association of specific fruits with risk of type 2 diabetes.
Moreover, greater fruit juice consumption was associated with
an increased risk, and substitution of whole fruits for fruit juice
was associated with a lower risk, except for strawberries and
cantaloupe.
Results in relation to other studies
In eight previous prospective studies, the association between
total fruit consumption and risk of type 2 diabetes was
examined,2-9 and the results were mixed. Similar to previous
analyses in the Nurses’ Health Study3 and the Finnish Mobile
Clinic Health Examination Survey study,2 the current findings
supported an inverse association between total fruit consumption
and risk of type 2 diabetes, but not in other studies.4-9 In contrast
to total fruit consumption, evidence on consumption of
individual fruits or fruit groups with risk of type 2 diabetes is
limited and incomplete. In four prospective studies, consumption
of citrus fruit was not associated with a lower risk of type 2
diabetes.5-8 Apple consumption was inversely associated with
risk in the Women’s Health Study29 and in the Finnish study,30
but not in the Iowa Women’s Health Study.31 In addition, greater
consumption of berries was associated with a lower risk in the
Finnish study,2 but not in the Iowa Women’s Health Study.31 In
our previous analyses that focused on anthocyanin rich fruits,
intakes of blueberries, strawberries, and apples were associated
with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes.32 Consistently, in a clinical
trial, increased consumption of berries improved glycemic
control among people with diabetes.33 Our current investigation
extended the evidence in this regard and found novel, inverse
associations for grapes, bananas, and grapefruit.
The different associations of individual fruits with diabetes risk
may be due to the heterogeneous composition of these foods.
Firstly, blueberries, apples, and red or black grapes contain high
levels of anthocyanins.12 In mice with diabetes, bilberry extract
rich in anthocyanins can activate adenosine
monophosphate-activated protein kinase, enhance glucose uptake
and utilization in white adipose tissue and skeletal muscle, and
reduce glucose production in the liver.34 Our previous analyses
also showed that levels of anthocyanin intake were inversely
associated with risk of type 2 diabetes.32 In the current study,
further adjustment for anthocyanins did not substantially change
the associations for individual fruits, suggesting that the inverse
associations of individual fruits are likely due to other
constituents of these foods. Both red and white grapes contain
high levels of resveratrol in skin.35 In mice, a high fat diet with
0.04% resveratrol increased insulin sensitivity at 24 months
compared with the same diet without resveratrol.36 However,
randomized controlled trials examining the effects of
supplementation of resveratrol on glucose metabolism have
generated inconsistent results.37-39 Prunes, peaches, plums,
apricots, and apples contain chlorogenic acid,40-43 which may

potentially mediate the beneficial effects of coffee consumption
on diabetes risk.44 In rats, chlorogenic acid reduces glucose
dependent insulinotropic peptide secretion by slowing glucose
absorption in the intestine.45 Moreover, chlorogenic acid
increases muscle glucose uptake in mice with diabetes.46 Finally,
grapefruits contain high amounts of naringin.12 In rats, naringin
inhibits dipeptidyl peptidase 4 similarly to sitagliptin, a
dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitor used for the treatment of
diabetes.47 Inhibition of dipeptidyl peptidase 4 increases
glucagon-like peptide 1, which subsequently leads to improved
glucose tolerance.48 In contrast to these specific fruits mentioned
above, cantaloupe was associated with an increased risk of type
2 diabetes in the current analysis. Melons have lower levels of
phytochemicals than the aforementioned fruits.12 None the less,
little evidence exists regarding the effects of melons on glucose
metabolism. Although other fruits may also be beneficial for
glucose metabolism, significant associations between other
specific fruits and risk of type 2 diabetes were not found in the
current and previous investigations.5-8
The glycemic index/glycemic load values of fruits did not seem
to be the factor that determined their association with type 2
diabetes in the current study, although in a clinical trial,
increased consumption of low glycemic index fruits improved
glycemic control among people with diabetes.33 In recent
meta-analyses, a higher dietary glycemic index/glycemic load
was associated with a greater risk of type 2 diabetes.49 50 In the
Nurses’ Health Study and Health Professionals Follow-up Study,
the associations between dietary glycemic index and risk of type
2 diabetes were positive, although the associations for dietary
glycemic load were not significant.51-53 None the less, the
contribution of total fruit consumption to dietary glycemic load
was rather small (about 10%) in these populations. Of individual
fruits, the top three contributors to dietary glycemic load were
bananas (3-4%), apples (2%), and grapes (1%). In contrast, the
relatively high glycemic load values of fruit juices13 along with
reduced levels of beneficial nutrients through juicing
processes11 12 (for example, the glycemic load values per serving
are 6.2 for raw oranges and 13.4 for orange juice, and fibre
levels per serving are 3.1 g and 0.5 g, respectively) may explain
the positive associations between fruit juice consumption and
risk of type 2 diabetes. Moreover, the difference in the viscosity
of foods is also an important factor affecting postprandial blood
glucose dynamics. Fluids pass through the stomach to the
intestine more rapidly than solids even if nutritional content is
similar.54 For example, fruit juices lead to more rapid and larger
changes in serum levels of glucose and insulin than whole
fruits.55 56 Although these mechanisms may potentially explain
the diverse associations for individual fruits, further research is
apparently needed to confirm our findings on specific fruits in
relation to type 2 diabetes and to further elucidate underlying
mechanisms.
Strengths and limitations of this study
The present study has several limitations. Firstly, measurement
errors were inevitable in the estimates of fruit consumption,
especially for individual fruits with lower consumption
levels.17 18 Adjustment for energy intake and use of cumulatively
averaged intake levels can reduce the magnitude of measurement
errors to some extent.26 Generally, random errors in exposure
assessments attenuate true associations toward the null.
Secondly, the possibility of false positive findings may exist
because we examined the associations of multiple fruits in the
current investigation without adjusting for multiple comparisons
based on a priori hypotheses. Meanwhile, most associations
were consistent across three cohorts, and the associations for

blueberries, grapes, and apples remained statistically significant
even after applying the Bonferroni correction, a conservative
method correcting for multiple comparisons. Thirdly, in our
food frequency questionnaires, intakes of some individual fruits
(apples and pears; peaches, plums, and apricots) were combined
because these fruits have similar nutrient profiles. Therefore we
could not determine whether the associations for these combined
fruits can be ascribed to a specific individual fruit. Fourthly, we
cannot exclude the possibility of recall bias in the assessments
of diet based on the food frequency questionnaires. However,
the prospective study design and exclusion of participants with
chronic diseases at baseline should minimize such bias. Fifthly,
although in the multivariable analysis we considered a multitude
of lifestyle and dietary factors, including other individual fruits,
residual or unmeasured confounding may still exist. Finally,
our study populations primarily consist of health professionals
with European ancestry. Thus our findings may not be
generalized to other populations.
Conclusions
Our findings suggest that there is significant heterogeneity in
the associations between individual fruits and risk of type 2
diabetes. Greater consumption of specific whole fruits,
particularly blueberries, grapes, and apples, was significantly
associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes, whereas greater
fruit juice consumption was associated with a higher risk. The
differences in the associations between individual fruits were
not accounted for by variation in the glycemic index/glycemic
load values of individual fruits. Overall, these results support
recommendations on increasing consumption of a variety of
whole fruits, especially blueberries, grapes, and apples, as a
measure for diabetes prevention.

What is already known on this topic

Total fruit consumption is not consistently associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes
The possible heterogeneity among individual fruits regarding the associations with risk of type 2 diabetes has not been examined

What this study adds

The associations with risk of type 2 diabetes are different among individual fruits
Greater consumption of specific whole fruits, particularly blueberries, grapes, and apples, is significantly associated with a lower risk of
type 2 diabetes, whereas increased consumption of fruit juices has the opposite association
In addition, the associations of individual fruits are not determined by their glycemic index or glycemic load values

and body composition. Diabetes 2013;62:1186-95.

Although type 2 diabetes is determined primarily by lifestyle and genes, dietary composition may affect
both its development and complications. Dietary fat is of particular interest because fatty acids inﬂuence
glucose metabolism by altering cell membrane function, enzyme activity, insulin signaling, and gene
expression. This paper focuses on the prevention of type 2 diabetes and summarizes the epidemiologic
literature on associations between types of dietary fat and diabetes risk. It also summarizes controlled
feeding studies on the effects of dietary fats on metabolic mediators, such as insulin resistance. Taken
together, the evidence suggests that replacing saturated fats and trans fatty acids with unsaturated (poly-
unsaturated and/or monounsaturated) fats has beneﬁcial effects on insulin sensitivity and is likely to
reduce risk of type 2 diabetes. Among polyunsaturated fats, linoleic acid from the n-6 series improves
insulin sensitivity. On the other hand, long-chain n-3 fatty acids do not appear to improve insulin sensi-
tivity or glucose metabolism. In dietary practice, foods rich in vegetable oils, including non-hydrogenated
margarines, nuts, and seeds, should replace foods rich in saturated fats from meats and fat-rich dairy
products. Consumption of partially hydrogenated fats should be minimized. Additional controlled,
long-term studies are needed to improve our knowledge on the optimal proportion of different types
of fats to prevent diabetes.

1. Introduction

Dietary composition could play a signiﬁcant role in improving
insulin sensitivity and reducing risk of diabetes and its complica-
tions [1]. The role of dietary fat in type 2 diabetes has been of clin-
ical interest for many decades. Kinsell et al. were probably the ﬁrst
to report that type of fat consumed could inﬂuence insulin action
in humans [2]. In a case report, a patient with type 1 diabetes re-
quired less exogenous insulin after substituting safﬂower oil rich
in n-6 FA for triglycerides rich in saturated fatty acids (SFA) and
oleic acid. Through our daily dietary intake, we ingest a variety
of fatty acids (FAs) with different chain-length and numbers of
double bonds. The most abundant dietary FAs are oleic acid, lino-
leic acid, palmitic acid, and stearic acid. These are reﬂected in plas-
ma and tissue lipids. Thus, dietary fatty acid composition, to a large
extent, determines the relative availability and storage of FAs in
tissues [3].

The aim of this paper is to review the role of different types of
dietary fat on insulin sensitivity and diabetes risk, and to update
previous reviews on this topic [4–6]. Since there are no long-
term randomized trials on the effect of dietary fat quality on dia-
betes risk, this review will focus on the effect of dietary FAs on
surrogate endpoints, e.g., insulin sensitivity in randomized con-
trolled interventions, and the relation of dietary fats to diabetes
incidence in epidemiologic studies. In controlled feeding studies,
test diets are typically isocaloric and differ only in dietary fat
quality. However, such studies are usually small and of short
duration, and thus, can only evaluate intermediate endpoints,
e.g., insulin sensitivity.

Epidemiologic studies, on the other hand, are typically large,
with long follow-up periods. Some of these studies have used
objective methodology to assess dietary fat quality with biomark-
ers of FA intake, e.g., serum FA composition. Other studies have as-
sessed dietary fat quality using food records or questionnaires.
Both types of studies will be discussed, but the latter have previ-
ously been reviewed in detail [5], and therefore, will only be brieﬂy
updated here.

2. Epidemiological studies

2.1. Assessment of dietary FA intake

In that the composition of several FAs in serum lipids or tissues
reﬂects the composition of dietary FAs, they can be used as objec-
tive and reliable biomarkers of the relative FA content of the
diet [7–10]. FAs that cannot be synthesized endogenously from
carbohydrates are the best biomarkers of FA intake. These include
polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), such as linoleic acid (n-6) and
a-linolenic acid (n-3), trans fatty acids (TFA), and odd numbered
FAs, e.g., 15:0 and 17:0 [11]. Excellent biomarkers are also avail-
able for long-chain n-3 FAs found in oily ﬁsh. Conversely, SFA
(except SFAs with an odd number of carbon atoms) and monoun-
saturated fatty acids (MUFA) are usually considered weaker
biomarkers since they reﬂect not only dietary intake, but also, to
some extent, de novo lipogenesis.

The ability to assess the source of FAs and food patterns is an
advantage offered by food records or food frequency question-
naires. For example, increased MUFA intake (i.e., oleic acid) could
be due to either high consumption of meats and dairy products,
or non-hydrogenated vegetable oils (e.g., rapeseed oil and olive
oil). This may explain why observational studies found a positive
association between monounsaturated fat and insulin concentra-
tions, [5] while a large controlled intervention showed that replac-
ing SFA with MUFA led to improved insulin sensitivity [12].

The lipid fraction or tissue in which FAs are measured should be
considered when interpreting biomarkers of FA intake. Depending
on which FAs are being studied, the activity of enzymes responsi-
ble for desaturating and elongating FAs can also inﬂuence FA com-
position [13]. In addition, the FA composition in tissues can be
affected by genetic, hormonal and lifestyle factors [13].

FA ratios, i.e., product-to-precursor ratios, have been used in sev-
eral epidemiological studies as markers for desaturase enzyme
activities, and recently, as indirect markers of saturated fat intake,
e.g., the 16:1n-7/16:0 ratio [14,15]. This ratio may be a better marker
of saturated fat intake than serum palmitic acid proportions alone
[14], but further research is needed on the potential use of ratios
as markers of dietary intake. It should be noted that biomarkers of
FAs provide data as percentages of total FAs, not absolute amounts.

2.2. Cross-sectional studies of dietary fat and diabetes

Many cross-sectional or case-control studies have compared
dietary fat intake of diabetic patients and healthy subjects. In the
multinational, multicentre study of the Mediterranean Group for
the Study of Diabetes, dietary surveys were conducted in six coun-
tries. The results showed that recently-diagnosed diabetics had
both higher relative intake of total fat and SFA from animal fat
sources compared with healthy controls. Furthermore, subjects
with undiagnosed type 2 diabetes had signiﬁcantly higher intake
of saturated fat compared with controls [16]. The latter is relevant
because these subjects did not have the chance to change their diet
due to diagnosis of type 2 diabetes or dietary treatment [16].

The problem of confounding still remains. Nonetheless, these
data are in line with a Dutch study on patients with newly-diag-
nosed diabetes; subjects who had a higher intake of total fat
(40% energy, E), and in particular, saturated fat (15% E) [17]. It
should be noted that cross-sectional observational studies investi-
gating links between dietary fat quality and prediabetes/diabetes
require cautious interpretation due to several sources of bias,
e.g., change of diet due to obesity or prediabetes, or failure to make
detailed adjustments for adiposity or physical activity.

2.3. FA biomarkers, insulin resistance, and diabetes risk

2.3.1. FA biomarkers and insulin sensitivity: cross-sectional studies

Cross-sectional studies that use the clamp technique to mea-
sure insulin sensitivity and FA composition in skeletal muscle
show a direct relation between the proportion of long-chain PUFA
and insulin action [18]. In contrast, the more saturated the muscle
membrane, the more insulin resistant the individual [18]. A

cross-sectional study in Pima Indians reported similar outcomes
[19], i.e., an inverse association between the amount of n-3 FAs
and insulin resistance.

The Uppsala Longitudinal Study of Adult Men (ULSAM) in-
cluded 2,322 50-year-old men at baseline who have been fol-
lowed for 35 years, with detailed metabolic measurements
approximately every 10 years. Cross-sectional data at age 70 sug-
gest that there is no link between n-3 FA composition (in skeletal
muscle phospholipids and serum cholesterol esters) and insulin
sensitivity. Rather, they demonstrate a FA composition in serum
cholesterol esters and skeletal muscle phospholipids; a composi-
tion associated with insulin resistance and characterized by high
proportions of palmitic (16:0), palmitoleic (16:1n-7) and dihomo-
c-linolenic (20:3n-6) acids and a low proportion of linoleic acid
(18:2n-6) [13,20]. A smaller cross-sectional study also found a
negative correlation between SFA in serum phospholipids and
insulin sensitivity in healthy subjects. Conversely, there was a
positive relation between linoleic and arachidonic acid and insu-
lin action [21]. In a Finnish population-based study, a FA pattern
with high palmitic and palmitoleic acid, and low linoleic acid in
cholesterol esters, has been associated with glucose intolerance
and type 2 diabetes [22].

2.3.2. FA biomarkers and diabetes: prospective studies

Several prospective studies suggest that a FA pattern that re-
ﬂects high intake of saturated fat and low relative intake of lin-
oleic acid predicts type 2 diabetes. A prospective study of the
ULSAM cohort, in which 50-year-old men were followed for 10
years, showed that diabetes incidence during follow-up was re-
lated to the FA composition of serum cholesterol esters at base-
line [23]. The differences in serum FA composition were highly
signiﬁcant in subjects who remained normoglycemic (n = 1753)
compared with those who later developed type 2 diabetes
(n = 75). The men who developed diabetes had higher propor-
tions of SFA and palmitoleic acid, a low proportion of linoleic
acid, and a relatively high content of gamma-linolenic (18:3n-
6) and dihomo-gamma-linolenic (20:3n-6) acids in the serum
cholesterol esters. The outcome was also similar after adjustment
for differences in body mass index (BMI) [23]. In line with the
cross-sectional analyses of ULSAM, there were no associations
between n-3 fatty acids in serum and diabetes incidence during
follow-up.

In a Finnish prospective cohort study, middle-aged normogly-
cemic men (n = 895) were followed for 4 years [24]. Those who
developed impaired fasting glucose (IFG) (n = 56) or type 2 diabe-
tes (n = 34) during follow-up had higher proportions of esteriﬁed
and non-esteriﬁed saturated FAs and decreased proportions of
polyunsaturated FAs at baseline. Logistic regression analyses ad-
justed for age, obesity, and fasting lipid, glucose, and insulin con-
centrations showed that men with proportions of non-esteriﬁed
and esteriﬁed linoleate in the upper third had nearly half the risk
for developing IFG or diabetes compared with those in the lower
third [24]. A prospective study (9-year follow-up) in 2909 Amer-
ican subjects 45–64 years of age also showed that those who
developed diabetes during follow-up (n = 252) had a higher pro-
portion of SFA in serum cholesterol esters and phospholipids
[25]. These results were consistent with the studies by Vessby
et al. and Laaksonen et al. [23,24]. The association remained after
adjustments for age, sex, BMI, waist-to-hip ratio, alcohol intake,
cigarette smoking, physical activity, education, and parental his-
tory of diabetes. Diabetes incidence was positively associated
with the proportions of palmitic (16:0), palmitoleic (16:1n-7),
and dihomo-gamma-linolenic (20:3n-6) acids, and inversely asso-
ciated with the proportion of linoleic acid in cholesterol esters. In
phospholipids, there was a positive association between SFA (pal-
mitic and stearic acid) and diabetes risk [25].

The potential role of SFA intake in the development of diabetes
is also in line with recent data from the ULSAM cohort. These sug-
gest that saturated fat intake among 50-year-old men indepen-
dently predicts insulin resistance 20 years later, a ﬁnding
reﬂected by an elevated 16:1n-7/16:0 ratio in cholesterol esters
[15]. In prospective studies, most of the associations remained
after adjusting for several lifestyle factors, including physical activ-
ity, smoking, and obesity.

A recent prospective study with nested case-cohort analyses
(Melbourne Collaborative Cohort Study) investigated both dietary
FA intake reported by food frequency questionnaire as well as FA
composition of plasma phospholipids in relation to type 2 diabetes
in 3737 adults [26]. Total SFA in phospholipids and reported die-
tary intake were positively related to diabetes incidence. Plasma
linoleic acid was inversely associated with diabetes incidence,
but dietary intake of linoleic acid showed a positive association
[26]. This contradictory result could reﬂect measurement error in
self-reported dietary intake. However, lack of adjustment for total
energy intake may also lead to biased estimates. Further study is
needed to determine the extent to which reduced plasma linoleic
acid proportions might reﬂect metabolic dysfunction (i.e., reduced
delta-6 desaturase activity).

2.4. Self-reported dietary intakes and diabetes risk: prospective studies

Several prospective studies using food records or question-
naires to assess dietary fat intake have been summarized in prior
reviews by Hu et al. [5] and Lichtenstein and Schwab [6].
Although not entirely consistent, prospective data from self-re-
ported dietary intake generally support those from studies that
use biomarkers, i.e., those that suggest an inverse association be-
tween n-6 PUFA intake and diabetes risk [5,6]. For example, the
Nurses’ Health Study—with 84,204 women aged 34–59 prospec-
tively followed for 14 years (2507 diabetes cases during follow-
up)—showed that PUFA intake assessed by a validated food fre-
quency questionnaire was inversely and signiﬁcantly associated
with incidence of type 2 diabetes, whiles MUFA or SFA intake
was not related to diabetes risk after adjusting for (BMI) and
other covariates [27]. Risk reduction related to PUFA was maxi-
mized when PUFA replaced trans fatty acid (TFA) intake. In the
same cohort, a low polyunsaturated to saturated fat (P/S) ratio
was independently related to an increased risk of cardiovascular
disease in women with type 2 diabetes [28].

In this study, a 5% replacement of SFA with MUFA or carbohy-
drates is associated with respective risk reduction of cardiovascu-
lar disease in diabetics of 37% and 22%. Nuts, an important food
source of PUFA and MUFA in this population, have been associ-
ated with lower risk of diabetes in women even after adjusting
for ﬁbre intake and various lifestyle factors [29]. Twelve-year
data from the Health Professionals Follow-up Study—with
42,504 men aged 40–74 years (1321 diabetes cases during fol-
low-up)—showed that SFA intake was associated with increased
risk of diabetes independent of cereal ﬁbre intake and estab-
lished risk factors, but not BMI [30]. In addition, multivariate
analyses showed that regular processed meat consumption was
related to increased diabetes risk. PUFA intake was not signiﬁ-
cantly associated with diabetes risk in the whole population,
but there was an inverse relation between the intake of linoleic
acid and diabetes incidence among men under the age of 65
and in normal-weight subjects.
In the Iowa Women’s Health
Study, incidence of type 2 diabetes during 11 years of follow-
up was independently and inversely associated with vegetable
fat intake reported by a food frequency questionnaire [31]. There
was also an inverse relation between diabetes incidence and sub-
stitution of PUFA for SFA. These associations remained signiﬁcant
after adjusting for obesity and fat distribution, physical activity,

U. Risérus et al. / Progress in Lipid Research 48 (2009) 44–51

47

and smoking. In addition, there was a signiﬁcant positive associ-
ation between animal fat intake and diabetes incidence, which
was also independent of obesity and lifestyle factors [31].

In the European prospective investigation of the Cancer Norfolk
Study, diet was assessed by semiquantitative food frequency ques-
tionnaire [32]. Of the 23,631 men and women who were followed,
414 subjects developed diabetes during 3–7 years. An increased
dietary P/S ratio was associated with a reduced risk of diabetes
independent of various lifestyle factors, but not of obesity and cen-
tral fat distribution [32]—a ﬁnding similar to the results from the
Health Professionals Follow-up Study [30]. It should be noted that
studies measuring serum FA composition or other prospective data
using reported dietary fat intake found similar relations with dia-
betes, but obesity did not mediate the associations [23,24,31]. It
could also be argued that obesity lies in the causal pathway be-
tween fat intake and diabetes, and thus, it would not be appropri-
ate to routinely adjust for BMI when examining relations between
dietary fat quality and diabetes.

Epidemiological data on n-3 FA intake and diabetes risk and
insulin sensitivity have been somewhat inconsistent [5], but pro-
spective cohort studies that have examined the association be-
tween long chain n-3 FA and type 2 diabetes generally show no
appreciable association.

2.5. Trans fatty acids (TFA) and diabetes

The adverse effects of trans fatty acids (TFA) on cardiovascular
disease are well-established [33,34], but their role in the develop-
ment of type 2 diabetes has not been as widely investigated. The
Nurses’ Health Study is the largest and most detailed epidemiol-
ogic study because of the many repeated assessments of diet
[27]. It showed a positive association between TFA intake and risk
of diabetes, with a clear dose–response relation. Small epidemiol-
ogic studies or those that did not include repeated measures of
diet, did not indicate a positive association [31]. Although it is
not proven that inﬂammation is a causative factor in diabetes
development, mounting evidence suggests that TFA increases
inﬂammatory cytokines that are related to risk of diabetes [35].

2.6. Dairy fat, insulin resistance, and diabetes

Dairy fat contains high amounts of SFA (70% of milk fat is SFA).
In addition to lauric acid (12:0), cow’s milk is also abundant in
short-chain and medium chain FA with 4–10 carbons as well as
odd numbered FAs, e.g., 15:0 and 17:0. In a cross-sectional study
of elderly Swedish men, dairy fat intake was inversely associated
with several metabolic anomalies, including elevated fasting plas-
ma glucose concentrations [36]. It was also signiﬁcantly correlated
with 15:0 and 17:0 in serum lipids, which can be considered bio-
markers of dairy fat intake. In contrast, plasma phospholipid con-
centrations of 15:0 were inversely related to incidence of type 2
diabetes in a case-cohort study with 4 years of follow-up [26].
Pereira et al. found that among young adults who were overweight
at baseline (but not among leaner individuals), dairy consumption
was also inversely related to the incidence of metabolic factors
associated with insulin resistance [37].

In the Health Professionals Follow-up Study, a dietary pattern
characterized by higher dairy intake, especially low-fat dairy in-
take, was related to a reduced risk of type 2 diabetes in men
[38]. A dietary pattern rich in low-fat dairy products has also been
associated with lower risk of type 2 diabetes in middle-aged or old-
er women [39]. It is not clear which components of dairy products
contribute to the observed beneﬁt. A stronger association with
low-fat or fat-free dairy suggests that dairy fat is unlikely to have
independent protective effects against diabetes.

3. Controlled dietary interventions

3.1. Overview

No long-term randomized controlled studies on the relation be-
tween the quality of dietary fat and diabetes risk exist. Thus, we
have to rely on short-term studies on the effects of dietary FAs
on surrogate endpoints, e.g., insulin sensitivity, insulin secretion,
or glycemic control. FAs may not only act through alterations of
cell-membrane FA composition and function, but also through
short-term alterations of gene expression and enzyme activities.
Vessby reviewed several randomized controlled short-term studies
conducted in the 1990s, mainly in healthy subjects [4]. These
lasted up to 4 weeks [40–43], except for one study in hypertensive
subjects, which had a duration of 16 weeks [44]. All of these stud-
ies directly measured insulin sensitivity by euglycemic clamp or
minimal modelling, and had isocaloric test diets that differed only
in dietary fat quality. Limitations included short duration and small
sample size. Overall results from these studies showed no signiﬁ-
cant effect of SFA, MUFA, or PUFA on insulin sensitivity [4].

Two other studies compared PUFA with MUFA in subjects with
either impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) [45] or type 2 diabetes [46].
Outcomes showed no signiﬁcant differences in insulin sensitivity
despite signiﬁcant changes in plasma FA composition. Notably,
the study on patients with diabetes lasted only 24 days, with the
proportion of total fat in the test diets increased from a baseline
of 34% E to 40% [46]. The other study lasted for 8 weeks, but dif-
fered in the proportion of total dietary fat and carbohydrates, com-
plicating a direct comparison between the two test diets [45].
Several additional studies have been conducted in the past few
years. These tend to show somewhat more positive results, possi-
bly because of their greater statistical power. Still, minor variations
in population demographics and type of fat source can contribute
to differences in outcomes. Below, we describe some of the latest
studies in more detail.

3.2. Role of monounsaturated fats

In a randomized controlled crossover study in 25 healthy sub-
jects, isocaloric diets were consumed for 4 weeks, with all diets
prepared in a metabolic kitchen [47]. There were no differences
in insulin sensitivity between diets rich in SFA, MUFA, or trans
fat (9% E either as palmitic acid, oleic acid and 18:1 trans, respec-
tively, with total fat 28% E). However, in the subgroup of over-
weight
subjects, SFA reduced insulin sensitivity (by 24%)
compared with MUFA. This decrease, however, was not statistically
signiﬁcant, possibly due to a small number of subjects in the sub-
group (n = 7). This ﬁnding indicates that type of fat might be more
important in subjects with an ‘‘insulin resistant phenotype,” but
the premise needs further investigation in larger studies.

The KANWU study is the largest randomized controlled clinical
trial to date [12]. This multicentre trial included 162 healthy par-
ticipants recruited from ﬁve different countries. Subjects received
isocaloric diets that differed only in fat quality; both the SFA diet
(17% E from SFA, 14% E from MUFA, 6% E from PUFA) and the MUFA
diet (23% E from MUFA, 8% E from SFA, 6% E from PUFA) had a total
fat intake of 37% E. All subjects were supplied with edible fats to be
used as spreads on bread, for cocking, and as dressings. Core foods,
such as margarines, oils and a range of other staple items, were
provided. Subjects did not know which diet they were on.

The main ﬁnding was that substitution of MUFA for SFA im-
proved insulin sensitivity, which was impaired on the SFA diet
( 10%, P = 0.03) but did not change on the MUFA diet (+2%, NS)
(P = 0.05 for difference between diets). A second important ﬁnding
was that subjects with higher total fat intake (i.e., >37%E) did not

48

obtain a beneﬁcial effect from MUFA. This outcome is consistent
with results from a controlled lifestyle intervention where changes
in estimated desaturase activities (derived from plasma FA compo-
sition) were related to changes in insulin sensitivity only in sub-
jects with a total fat intake below 35.5% E [48]. This potential
interaction between fat quality and quantity needs further investi-
gation, especially since overall evidence does not suggest that total
fat intake alone plays an important role in determining insulin
sensitivity.

In line with the KANWU study, a controlled short-term trial in
healthy subjects (n = 59) reported impaired insulin sensitivity in
those who consumed a SFA-enriched diet compared with those
who consumed a MUFA-rich diet [49]. The total fat content of
the test diets was 38% E. The same group recently conducted an-
other controlled crossover study in insulin resistant (n = 11) off-
spring of obese diabetic patients. Again, the results indicated that
a diet rich in MUFA improved insulin sensitivity compared with a
diet rich in SFA [50]. These effects were observed despite the short
intervention period (28 days) and the relatively high intake of total
fat.

3.3. Role of polyunsaturated fats

Linoleic acid is the most abundant PUFA in the diet. In a ran-
domized trial by Summers et al., a diet rich in PUFA n-6 (e.g., lino-
leic acid) improved insulin sensitivity when compared with a SFA-
rich diet after only 5 weeks [51]. It should be noted that more than
half of the participants were obese or had type 2 diabetes. Another
signiﬁcant ﬁnding was a reduction of visceral fat when SFA was re-
placed by PUFA, but it is unclear whether the reduction mediated
the improved insulin sensitivity.

This study indicates that it may be possible to inﬂuence insulin
sensitivity within 4–5 weeks by changing fat quality alone [47,49–
51]. It also suggests that FAs could affect insulin sensitivity by
other mechanisms (e.g., gene expression) rather than by changes
in cell-membrane FA composition, which entails a longer process.
Despite the important long-term effects of FAs on insulin action,
there are few data from randomized clinical trials. Therefore, large
prospective epidemiological studies with extended follow-up may
have a particularly important role in the evaluation of long-term
effects of FA on the risk of diabetes.

Data from controlled feeding studies in patients with diabetes
are also very limited. Heine and colleagues conducted a random-
ized crossover study in subjects with type 2 diabetes almost 2
decades ago [52]. Diets were isocaloric and total fat content was
approximately 38% E. Two 30-week periods with different dietary
P/S-ratios (0.3 vs. 1.0) were compared in 14 patients (completers).
The differences in diets were achieved by substitution of linoleic-
acid-enriched oils and margarines with SFA; other nutrients were
kept constant. Insulin sensitivity was assessed by calculating met-
abolic clearance rate (MCR) from insulin dose response curves
[53].

During the high P/S diet, insulin-mediated glucose disposal at
physiologic insulinemia increased signiﬁcantly (32%) compared
with the low P/S diet. However, at higher insulin infusion rates,
the MCRs of glucose were not signiﬁcantly different between diets
[52]. Since the total fat content was high (38%), it is possible that a
beneﬁcial effect of the high P/S-diet was underestimated [12,48].
Nevertheless, this study is important since it suggests a potential
long-term beneﬁt from the substitution of SFA with n-6 PUFA. This
outcome is in line with recently-reported short-term ﬁndings [51].

3.4. Role of n-3 FA from ﬁsh

Animal experiments indicate that intake of fatty acids from the
n-3 family, from ﬁsh oils in particular, have a beneﬁcial effect on

insulin sensitivity in rats [54], but not in healthy humans [12] or
in subjects with type 2 diabetes as shown in several controlled
studies [4,55]. These results are consistent with those from a re-
cent study in which n-3 supplementation (3.5% E) for 14 weeks
had no effect on high-molecular weight adiponectin concentra-
tions in moderately obese subjects [56]. Insulin sensitivity, how-
ever, was not measured in that study. Moreover, a recent report
indicated that high doses of n-3 FA (ﬁsh oil) may even impair insu-
lin action in subjects with type 2 diabetes [57].

3.5. The n-6/n-3 ratio and insulin resistance

The few available studies on the n-6/n-3 FA ratio suggest that it
does not play a major role in the development of insulin resistance
and type 2 diabetes [58]. In particular, controlled intervention stud-
ies show that n-6/n-3 ratio has no impact on insulin action [59,60].
In contrast (as discussed above and as previously pointed out by oth-
ers [61]), lowering the intake of linoleic acid may actually increase
both diabetes and cardiovascular risk [33,61]. Although it is believed
that n-6 FAs are proinﬂammatory compared with n-3 FAs, this
hypothesis is not supported by clinical or epidemiologic data in hu-
mans. Rather, some data show that linoleic acid is inversely related
to plasma C-reactive protein concentrations [62,63], and might have
anti-inﬂammatory effects by down-regulating NF-jB [61].

3.6. Trans fatty acids and insulin resistance

Data from controlled feeding studies on the effects of TFA on
insulin sensitivity in humans have been inconsistent [64], but the
duration of these studies is relatively short. In monkeys, a 5-year
controlled study found that TFA feeding (vs. oleic acid) caused
insulin resistance and impaired glucose metabolism [65].

Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA)—a group of 18:2n-6 conjugated
trans FAs found in dairy fat and partially hydrogenated vegetable
oils—may have diabetogenic effects in humans. Data demonstrate
that the trans10cis12-CLA isomer, in doses of 1% E, impairs insulin
sensitivity in abdominally obese men with the metabolic syn-
drome [66]. In fact, trans10cis12-CLA is the most potent FA known
with regard to impaired insulin sensitivity, at least in prediabetic
subjects with the metabolic syndrome [64].

Impaired insulin action has been closely linked to CLA-induced
lipid peroxidation and inﬂammation [67], but other mechanisms,
such as ectopic fat accumulation and downregulation of peroxi-
some proliferator activating receptors (PPARs) may also be in-
volved. Although the potential diabetogenic effect of CLA is
mainly ascribed to trans10cis12-CLA, a commercial CLA isomer
mixture caused impaired insulin sensitivity in subjects with type
2 diabetes [68]. In addition, data show that the cis9trans11-CLA
isomer found in dairy fat may cause modest impairment of insulin
sensitivity in abdominally obese individuals [69].

4. Dietary fats and diabetes: potential mechanisms

Mechanisms underlying the relation between dietary FAs and
incidence of diabetes are still unclear, but the traditional view
has been that dietary fat quality mainly affects cell-membrane
FA composition and, consequently, cell membrane function [70].
The FA composition of cell membranes is thought to alter several
cellular functions, including membrane ﬂuidity, ion permeability,
and insulin receptor binding/afﬁnity; functions affected by translo-
cation of glucose transporters interacting with second messengers
[71]. Such alterations could, in turn, affect tissue and whole body
insulin sensitivity.

More recent experimental data also point toward other mecha-
nisms that involve direct regulatory effects on gene expression and
enzyme activity [72]. SFA and MUFA, for example, have minimal

U. Risérus et al. / Progress in Lipid Research 48 (2009) 44–51

acid > docosahexaenoic

effects on lipogenic gene expression, while PUFA (arachidonic
acid > eicosapentaenoic
acid > linoleic
acid) suppresses lipogenic expression in vitro [73], partly by bind-
ing to and activating nuclear receptors, such as PPAR [74]. SFA also
affects enzyme activities, inﬂammatory gene expression, and tran-
scription factors that may contribute to its effects on glucose
metabolism [75]. As discussed above, the potential beneﬁt of lino-
leic acid in preventing diabetes may also be related to its potential
anti-inﬂammatory effects [61,62]. This hypothesis requires further
investigation in controlled clinical studies. Finally, a diet high in
unsaturated long-chain n-6 and n-3 FA may inhibit hepatic lipo-
genesis and stimulate hepatic FA oxidation, which may improve
hepatic insulin sensitivity [72].

In vitro studies and animal experiments suggest that FAs could
act directly on insulin-sensitive tissues [58]. In several experi-
ments, PUFAs (e.g., linoleic acid and n-3 FAs) have suppressed lip-
ogenic gene expression and enhanced oxidative metabolism.
Conversely, SFAs—palmitic acid, in particular—have had an oppo-
site effect [72,76]. Recently, non-esteriﬁed or free fatty acids
(FFA) have been identiﬁed as ligands for orphan G-protein coupled
receptors (GPCRs) that may also mediate some effects of dietary
FAs on insulin action and secretion.

It has been suggested that FFA play a critical role in physiolog-
ical glucose homeostasis [77]. GPR40 and GPR120 are activated by
medium and long-chain FFAs. While the former, in particular, may
mediate effects of FAs on insulin secretion [78,79], GPR41 and
GPR43 can be activated by short-chain FFA [80]. Both groups of
FAs are abundant in fat from dairy sources. GPCRs are, therefore,
potentially interesting as novel targets for diabetes prevention
and treatment.

Another interesting receptor family in this context is the Toll-
Like Receptors (TLR). TLRs could be a mediating link between
FAs, inﬂammation and insulin resistance [81]. In vitro studies have
shown especially that the saturated FA lauric acid (12:0) initiates
TLR4 signaling in macrophages [82–84], but has also been shown
that other SFA (14:0, 16:0 and 18:0) could activate TLR4 which
in turn trigger inﬂammatory responses by activating IKK/NF-jB
pathway and stimulate macrophage production of cytokines [85].
The TLR4 signaling pathway has been identiﬁed as a key mediator
of deleterious effects of palmitic acid including inﬂammation, im-
paired endothelial NO signaling and insulin signal transduction
[86]. These experimental studies thus suggest that TLRs are inﬂu-
enced differently depending on the type of FA.

5. Conclusions

Available data from controlled intervention studies suggest
beneﬁcial effects on insulin sensitivity when SFA and TFA are re-
placed with MUFA or PUFA. Outcomes from observational studies
using serum biomarkers of dietary fat intake or dietary question-
naires are consistent with those from controlled studies of insulin
sensitivity; both suggest that replacing SFA and TFA with PUFA will
lower the risk of type 2 diabetes. More controlled long-term stud-
ies with sufﬁcient power are needed to identify the optimal dietary
FA composition to reduce risk of type 2 diabetes.

Improving fat quality should be considered part of a dietary life-
style strategy to prevent or manage type 2 diabetes. In practice,
replacing fats from red meats and butter with non-hydrogenated
vegetable oils and margarines rich in MUFA and/or PUFA should
be encouraged to improve insulin sensitivity and reduce diabetes
risk. Such dietary fat composition also lowers cardiovascular risk
by reducing the serum LDL/HDL ratio and triacylglycerols [33,34].
Besides plant-based oils, nuts and seeds are also excellent
sources of both MUFA and PUFA. There is stronger evidence for a
potential protective effect from n-6 fatty acids (i.e., those rich in
linoleic acid) than for n-3 fatty acids, but more research is needed.

Few data are available on the effects of dietary fat quality in indi-
viduals with diabetes, and the optimal proportion of SFA, MUFA,
and PUFA remains uncertain. Future studies are needed to investi-
gate the interaction between dietary fat quantity and quality with
regard to insulin action and metabolic control.

Serum calcium and its complex association with incident
type 2 diabetes1

Ranee Chatterjee and Pao-Hwa Lin*

Department of Medicine, Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, NC

Type 2 diabetes is a worldwide epidemic that disparately affects
certain populations. Obesity is a leading risk factor for type 2 di-
abetes and has been the main focus for preventive efforts. However,
obesity continues to be a serious health issue in the United States,
and preventive efforts have not been fruitful. In addition to obesity,
other risk factors, such as the one suggested by Rooney et al. (1) in
this issue of the Journal, imply opportunities for the development
of new prevention strategies. In this study, the investigators eval-
uated serum calcium as a potential risk factor for incident diabetes
in a large biracial prospective cohort from the ARIC (Atheroscle-
rosis Risk in Communities) study. They also evaluated possible
racial differences in the association between serum calcium and
diabetes risk.

Serum calcium is a vital mineral for many cellular processes that
is tightly regulated by 3 main mechanisms, including renal ﬁl-
tering and reabsorption of calcium, bone turnover, and intestinal
absorption of dietary calcium (diet or supplements) (2). In turn,
these mechanisms are regulated by several endogenous factors,
including parathyroid hormone, parathyroid hormone–related
peptide, vitamin D, ionized calcium, and receptors for these fac-
tors, and renal function (2). Serum calcium, as well as each of these
other endogenous factors, has been associated with altered glucose
metabolism—which affects b cell function or insulin sensitivity—and
for some, with even longer-term diabetes risk (3–8). Although the
exact mechanism by which serum calcium may relate to diabetes risk
is unclear, earlier studies suggested that one possible mechanism is
that higher intracellular calcium may decrease the effect of insulin in
adipocytes by reducing glucose transporters, in particular the glucose
transporter type 4 (GLUT4) and insulin receptor activity (9, 10).

In the study by Rooney et al. (1) the investigators found that,
compared with those in the lowest quintile of serum calcium
concentrations, participants in the highest quintile had a higher
risk of diabetes. Such an association was not greatly inﬂuenced
after adjustment for certain endogenous factors that may inﬂuence
serum calcium, such as serum parathyroid hormone, vitamin D,
and phosphorus. In addition, despite the lack of a signiﬁcant
racial interaction, the positive association between serum cal-
cium and diabetes risk was stronger in African Americans than
in whites. Neither the calcium-sensing receptor polymorphisms
nor renal function was found to be a signiﬁcant effect modiﬁer
on the association.

In addition to endogenous regulators, exogenous factors may af-
fect serum calcium. The investigators addressed one such common
exogenous inﬂuence, which is diuretic use. Different types of di-
uretics affect serum calcium in different ways. Loop diuretics, such
as furosemide, increase urinary calcium excretion and can lower
serum calcium; thiazide diuretics, which are considered ﬁrst-line
therapy for hypertension (11), decrease urinary calcium excretion
and can lead to higher serum calcium concentrations; amiloride,
a potassium-sparing diuretic, also leads to a decrease in urinary
calcium excretion (12). In this study, although the association
persisted after the exclusion of participants taking any diuretic,
there was a decrease in the magnitude of the association between
serum calcium and diabetes risk. Further study is warranted to
determine the prevalence of each type of diuretic use and its re-
spective inﬂuence on serum calcium concentrations itself as well
as on the association between serum calcium and diabetes risk.

Dietary calcium intake is another important exogenous factor for
the maintenance of bone and body stores of calcium as well as for
serum calcium concentrations; however, when dietary calcium in-
takes are low, endogenous hormonal factors, especially parathyroid
hormone and vitamin D metabolites, act quickly to maintain phys-
iologically viable concentrations of serum calcium (13). Therefore,
with this interplay of factors, dietary calcium intake and serum
calcium concentrations are not usually observed to correlate tightly.
However, the excessive intake of calcium supplements can increase
serum calcium concentrations, and a low dietary calcium intake
may contribute to lower serum calcium concentrations (13). Unlike
the positive association found between serum calcium and diabetes
risk, results from observational studies have shown that dietary
calcium intake is inversely associated with diabetes risk. The pri-
mary source of dietary calcium is from dairy foods and to a lesser
extent from certain vegetables and calcium-fortiﬁed foods. A higher
intake of dairy foods overall has been associated with a lower
risk of type 2 diabetes (14, 15); but some studies found that the
intake of only certain types of dairy foods, particularly yogurt, is
associated with a lower risk of diabetes (15, 16). Some evidence

also suggests that dietary calcium from foods compared with cal-
cium supplements may have differing health beneﬁts; therefore,
possible differences in impact on diabetes risk should be investi-
gated (17). The inﬂuence of dietary calcium from food and sup-
plements on serum calcium concentrations or on diabetes risk was
not addressed in this study. Mechanisms linking dietary calcium or
dairy intake and serum calcium to diabetes risk may differ.

In the United States, African Americans have a 75% higher prev-
alence of diabetes compared with whites (18). Although traditional
risk factors such as obesity may account for a large proportion of
the racial disparity in diabetes risk, they do not account for all of
the disparity (19). Rooney et al. examined possible racial dif-
ferences in the association between serum calcium and diabetes
risk. Although they did not ﬁnd a signiﬁcant racial interaction, the
magnitude of the association was stronger in African Americans
than in whites. As described in this study, there are known racial
differences in factors that contribute to serum calcium homeosta-
sis that could explain this ﬁnding, including racial differences in
the endogenous factors that regulate serum calcium, such as renal
function, vitamin D, and parathyroid hormone (20–23). In addi-
tion, there are racial differences in exogenous contributors to
serum calcium concentrations. For the treatment of hypertension,
African Americans have been found to be more responsive to
thiazide diuretics, and for this group, thiazides are recommended
more strongly as a ﬁrst-line agent for treatment and are used more
than for whites (24). The use of thiazides could, in part, explain
the higher serum calcium concentrations found in this cohort of
African-American participants and should be investigated as a pos-
sible confounder of the calcium-diabetes association, particularly
among African Americans. There may also be a racial-ethnic dis-
parity in dietary calcium intake from dairy foods. African Amer-
icans commonly consume fewer dairy foods than do whites, in part
due to either perceived or actual concerns with lactose tolerance
(25, 26). The ﬁnding that serum calcium concentrations were high-
er in African Americans than in whites suggests a mechanism that
is less likely to be related to dietary intake of calcium.

The ﬁnding that higher serum calcium is associated with in-
creased diabetes risk is important and needs to be investigated
further. As with other risk factors for diabetes, the association
between serum calcium and diabetes risk is complex. Further re-
search and understanding of the mechanisms underlying the as-
sociation between serum calcium and diabetes risk may provide
a new opportunity to combat the diabetes epidemic.

OBJECTIVEdTo quantitatively assess the strength and shape of the association between
blood 25-hydroxy vitamin D [25(OH)D] levels and incident risk of type 2 diabetes.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODSdA systematic search of the MEDLINE and
Embase databases and a hand search of references from original reports were conducted up
to 31 October 2012. Prospective observational studies that assessed the association between
blood levels of 25(OH)D and risk of incident type 2 diabetes were included for meta-analysis.
DerSimonian and Laird’s random-effects model was used. A quadratic spline regression analysis
was used to examine the shape of the association with a generalized least-squares trend test
performed for the dose-response relation.
RESULTSdA total of 21 prospective studies involving 76,220 participants and 4,996 incident
type 2 diabetes cases were included for meta-analysis. Comparing the highest to the lowest
category of 25(OH)D levels, the summary relative risk for type 2 diabetes was 0.62 (95% CI
0.54–0.70). A spline regression model showed that higher 25(OH)D levels were monotonically
associated with a lower diabetes risk. This inverse association did not differ by sex, duration of
follow-up, study sample size, diabetes diagnostic criteria, or 25(OH)D assay method. A linear
trend analysis showed that each 10 nmol/L increment in 25(OH)D levels was associated with a
4% lower risk of type 2 diabetes (95% CI 3–6; P for linear trend , 0.0001).
CONCLUSIONSdOur meta-analysis showed an inverse and signiﬁcant association between
circulating 25(OH)D levels and risk of type 2 diabetes across a broad range of blood 25(OH)D
levels in diverse populations.

L ow vitamin D status is prevalent in

many populations and has become a
common public health problem
worldwide (1,2). Vitamin D is well-known
for its essential role in calcium homeostasis
and bone health (2). Emerging evidence

function, insulin resistance, and impaired
glucose intolerance and thereby may be
associated with higher risk of type 2 di-
abetes (4–7). An inverse association be-
tween 25(OH)D levels and prevalent type
2 diabetes has been shown (4,8–10);
however, a temporal relationship cannot
be established from such cross-sectional
studies that are subject to bias due to the
possibility of reverse causation. Recently,
several prospective observational studies
have reported a signiﬁcant association be-
tween high circulating levels of 25(OH)D
and lower incidence of type 2 diabetes (11–
17). However, no association was observed
in other studies (18–21). In addition, indi-
vidual studies have been underpowered to
examine this relation across a broad range
of circulating 25(OH)D levels. As high-
lighted by the recent report on vitamin D
from the Institute of Medicine (IOM)
(1,22), available evidence on the relation
between vitamin D status and type 2 diabe-
tes remains inconsistent and inconclusive,
and there is a need for further research to
clarify the optimal levels of 25(OH)D for
nonskeletal outcomes, including type 2
diabetes, and to assess whether there is
a nonlinear relationship between 25(OH)D
and diabetes risk. Assessment of possible
threshold levels of 25(OH)D will greatly
advance our understanding of the magni-
tude and shape of the association of vita-
min D with incidence of type 2 diabetes.
Available evidence from prospective
studies with circulating 25(OH)D levels
measured in baseline blood samples col-
lected before the onset of disease allow us to
address the temporal relation of vitamin D
status with risk of type 2 diabetes. We
therefore conducted a meta-analysis of
prospective studies from various popula-
tions to quantify the association between
circulating 25(OH)D levels and subsequent
risk of type 2 diabetes and examine possible
threshold effect of 25(OH)D levels.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND
METHODS

Data source and searches
Relevant studies were identiﬁed by search-
ing MEDLINE and Embase databases for
all published articles up to 31 October

2012, using the search terms “vitamin D,”
“25-hydroxy vitamin D,” “25(OH)D,” “1,25-
dihydroxy vitamin D,” “1,25(OH)2D,” “cal-
cidiol,” “calcitriol,” “insulin resistance,”
“insulin secretion,” “insulin sensitivity,” “glu-

stricted to English-language articles, hu-
man studies, and adult subjects aged $19

through a hand search of references from
original reports. All prospective studies on
this topic were considered eligible if they
provided data on the relationship between
baseline circulating levels of 25(OH)D and
risk of type 2 diabetes.

In the ﬁrst round of screening (n =
542), 470 articles were excluded for at
least one of the following reasons: studies
that did not study circulating 25(OH)D as
an exposure or type 2 diabetes as an out-
come (200 articles), studies among chil-
dren and adolescence populations (4
articles), nonhuman studies (15 articles,
including chemistry, animal, cell line, and
isolated tissue studies), reviews/editori-
als/guidelines/letters/commentaries (185
articles), cross-sectional or retrospective
studies (61 articles), and case reports (5
articles) (Fig. 1). In the second round of
screening, full-text articles were retrieved
(n = 72). Sixty-three articles were further
excluded for at least one of the following
reasons: updated data available from
other studies in the same population or
duplicate publications
(3 articles),

diabetes complications as major out-
comes (33 articles), association measures
for diabetes-related risk factors (19 articles),
and lack of directly measured 25(OH)D lev-
els (2 articles using predicted score). Our
search strategy and inclusion/exclusion cri-
teria resulted in a total of 21 independent
prospective studies (extracting from 15 ar-
ticles) being included in the current meta-
analysis.

Data extraction
Three investigators (Y.S., L.W., and L.C.D.G.)
independently reviewed each eligible
article and extracted relevant data exam-
ining the prospective associations of cir-
culating levels of 25(OH)D with type 2
diabetes risk. Differences,
if any, were
reconciled through group discussion.
Data extracted include population source,
study design, follow-up period, sample
size, subject characteristics (age, sex, and
comorbid conditions), 25(OH)D assay
methods, diabetes end points, and main
study ﬁndings. When results were avail-
able only on different subpopulations in
the same study (13,14,23), we separately
extracted data for each subpopulation
(study characteristics described in Supple-
mentary Table 1).

Statistical analysis
To provide quantitative evidence from all
studies and maximize statistical power for
hypothesis testing, we performed meta-
analyses using DerSimonian and Laird’s
random-effects model with inverse-variance

(SE) weighting of individual study results
(24) when data could be combined. The
summary relative risks (RR) with 95% CI
were calculated for the highest versus the
lowest category of 25(OH)D levels. We
also performed subgroup meta-analyses
to explore potential effect modiﬁcation
by prespeciﬁed factors, including sex,
follow-up duration, sample size of cases,
adjustment for BMI, adjustment for BMI
and other metabolic parameters (includ-
ing hypertension, lipids, or inﬂammatory
biomarkers), and 25(OH)D assay meth-
ods. Heterogeneity across studies was as-
sessed by Cochran Q statistic. Because
the Cochran Q statistic has low statistical
power (25), we also calculated the I2 and
H statistics to reﬂect between-study het-
erogeneity. The percentage of I2 ;25
(I2 = 25), 50 (I2 = 50), and 75 (I2 = 75)
indicates low, medium, and high hetero-
geneity, respectively (26). The H statistic
is a complement to the I2 statistic in assess-
ing study heterogeneity; an H ,1.2 indi-
cates little heterogeneity, and an H .1.5
raises caution regarding notable hetero-
geneity (26). We visually assessed publi-
cation bias using Begg modiﬁed funnel
plots, in which the RR was plotted on a
logarithmic scale (log[RR]) against its SE
from each study. Publication bias was
also assessed by two formal tests: Begg
adjusted rank correlation test and Egger
regression asymmetry test (27,28). The
former was used to examine if there was
signiﬁcant correlation between the effect
estimates and their variances, and the latter

uses an inverse-variance weighted regres-
sion of the effect sizes on their precision
(the inverse of SE) to test whether the in-
tercept deviates signiﬁcantly from zero.

We tested for possible nonlinear as-
sociation between circulating 25(OH)D
levels and type 2 diabetes using a quadratic
polynomial spline regression analysis,
considering a possibility of data perturba-
tion at an extreme end of the exposure
range (29). We also used the method de-
scribed by Greenland and Longnecker (30)
for the dose-response analysis to compute
the linear trend from the correlated RRs
and 95% CIs across categories of 25(OH)D.
The median level of 25(OH)D in each cat-
egory was assigned to the corresponding
RR when reported in the study. If not re-
ported, the values assigned were the means
or the midpoint of the lower and upper
bound in each category. For extreme
open-ended categories, half the width of
the adjacent category was subtracted (for
the lowest category) or added (for the up-
permost category) to obtain the midpoint.
The numbers of case and control subjects
or person-years by category were also col-
lected if available.

All analyses were performed using the
STATA statistical software (Version 10.1;
STATA Corp., College Station, TX). Sta-
tistical signiﬁcance was deﬁned as two-
tailed a , 0.05.
RESULTSdWe included 15 publica-
tions (11–16,18,19,23,31–33) that met
our inclusion criteria in our meta-analysis,
which provided data from 21 independent
studies [11 cohort studies (11–13,17,18,
20,21,31–33), 8 nested case-control stud-
ies (14,15,19,23), and 2 case-cohort stud-
ies (16,33)] (Fig. 1). These prospective
studies comprised a total of 76,220 partic-
ipants and 4,996 incident diabetes cases. As
summarized in Supplementary Table 1, 13
studies were population-based (12–
14,16,17,20,21,23,32,33), and 2 studies
included postmenopausal women only
(18,19). Nineteen studies included largely
whites (11–18,20,21,23,32,33), and 2
studies included multiple racial/ethnic
populations (19,31). The outcome of dia-
betes was ascertained using a combination
of criteria, including diabetes-speciﬁc
pharmacotherapy, diabetes-related hos-
pitalization, self-report, and glycemic
status information (11–16,18,19). Five
studies used the American Diabetes Asso-
ciation glycemic criteria for diagnosis
(20,21,23,31,33). The assay method for
25(OH)D varied across studies. Radio-
immunoassay was used in 8 studies

(14,15,18,21,33), chemiluminescent im-
munoassay was used in 10 studies (11–
13,16,17,19,23,32), and only 3 studies
used liquid chromatography–tandem
mass spectrometry, which is the gold stan-
dard to measure 25(OH)D (20,31,33).

Hypothesis testing
Fig. 2 shows the summary RR of type 2
diabetes comparing the highest to lowest
category of 25(OH)D levels for hypothe-
sis testing. The summary RR was 0.62
(95% CI 0.54–0.70), indicating a signiﬁ-
cant inverse association between baseline
25(OH)D levels and risk of type 2 diabe-
tes. The P value for the Cochran Q test
was 0.21, the H statistic was 1.1 (1.0–
1.5), and the I2 statistic was 19% (0–
53), indicating no evidence of signiﬁcant
between-study heterogeneity. The Begg
funnel plot for the visual assessment of
publication bias showed that smaller
RRs with large SEs tended to be above
the horizontal line, indicating a possibil-
ity of publication bias in favor of small
studies with null ﬁndings (data not
shown). However, the Egger test (P =
0.39) and the Begg test (P = 0.99) did
not show evidence of publication bias.

Sensitivity analysis
We conducted a sensitivity analysis to
assess the extent to which individual
studies with extremely large RRs inﬂu-
enced the summary RR. The exclusion of
the study by Anderson et al. (11) that
included the largest sample size and RR
estimate reduced between-study hetero-
geneity but did not appreciably change
the summary RR (0.64; 95% CI 0.56–
0.73; P for Q statistic = 0.27, H = 1.1
[1.0–1.4], and I2 = 15% [0–50]). Omit-
ting four studies from the earliest publi-
cation by Knekt et al. (14), which
included small sample size and heteroge-
neous results, also did not substantially
inﬂuence the summary RR (0.61; 95%
CI 0.55–0.68; P for Q statistic = 0.46,
H = 1.0 [1.0–1.4], and I2 = 0% [0–51]).
The most recent study with the smallest
number of cases (n = 37) yielded large
variance in the effect estimate; removing
this study led to almost the same sum-
mary RR (0.62; 95% CI 0.56–0.70; P
for Q statistic = 0.35, H = 1.0 [1.0–1.3], and
I2 = 9% [0–44]).

Sources of heterogeneity
We evaluated potential effect modiﬁers in
stratiﬁed analyses (Table 1). The inverse
association between 25(OH)D and diabe-
tes risk was consistently observed in men,

women, and a mixed population of men
and women. Associations tended to be
stronger for men than for women alone,
but the difference did not reach statistical
signiﬁcance. Nor did duration of follow-
up, study sample size, diabetes diagnostic
criteria, and 25(OH)D assay methods in-
ﬂuence the summary RRs. Several studies
presented RRs for 25(OH)D levels and
type 2 diabetes with and without adjust-
ment for metabolic variables, including
BMI, hypertension, markers of glycemia
and insulin sensitivity, plasma lipid lev-
els, or inﬂammatory markers. The associ-
ations between 25(OH)D levels and
diabetes risk were attenuated but re-
mained statistically signiﬁcant after ad-
justment for BMI and hypertension and/
or other biomarkers: the RRs were 0.52
(95% CI 0.46–0.58) and 0.63 (0.56–
0.72) in the models without and with ad-
justment for these covariates, respectively
(P for interaction = 0.02). Likewise, ad-
justment for BMI alone slightly attenuated
the association (P for interaction = 0.06).

Dose-response analysis
Fig. 3 shows the dose-response relation
between circulating 25(OH)D and risk of
type 2 diabetes. Overall, the test for a lin-
ear relation across the range of 25(OH)D
from 20 up to 160 nmol/L was signiﬁ-
cant (P , 0.0001). The RR for type 2 di-
abetes was 0.96 (95% CI 0.94–0.97) per
10 nmol/L increment in 25(OH)D. A sig-
niﬁcantly lower risk of type 2 diabetes
became evident when 25(OH)D approxi-
mated 50 nmol/L. Because most studies
had 25(OH)D ranges ,100 nmol/L, cur-
rent evidence for the relation of 25(OH)D
of .100 nmol/L with type 2 diabetes was
weak.
CONCLUSIONSdOn the basis of 21
prospective studies including 4,996 in-
cident cases of type 2 diabetes and 76,220
nondiabetic controls, our meta-analysis
showed a signiﬁcantly inverse association
between 25(OH)D levels and incidence of
type 2 diabetes. The association was
consistent and did not differ appreciably
by sex, study size, follow-up duration,
diabetes diagnosis criteria, or 25(OH)D
assay methods. The association was at-
tenuated but remained signiﬁcant after
adjustment for BMI and/or intermediate
biomarkers.

Blood 25(OH)D levels, which reﬂect
all sources of vitamin D exposure and
have a half-life of 2 to 3 weeks, have been
widely used as a surrogate of vitamin D
status (2,3). Due to differences in assay

methods and population characteristics,
there is no consensus on the cutoff values
deﬁning vitamin D insufﬁciency or deﬁ-
ciency. Vitamin D insufﬁciency has been
previously reported to range from levels
of 40–75 nmol/L (16–30 ng/mL), and vi-
tamin D deﬁciency is generally deﬁned as
levels of ,50 nmol/L (20 ng/mL) (2,34).
Using 25(OH)D levels #50 nmol/L
(20 ng/mL) to deﬁne vitamin D deﬁciency,
data from 4,495 adults in the National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
2005–2006 showed that the overall prev-
alence of vitamin D deﬁciency was 41.6%,
with the highest rate found in blacks
(82.1%), followed by Hispanics (62.9%),
others (57.6%), and whites (30.9%) (35).
The IOM’s new guidelines for vitamin D
intake and desirable blood levels, which
were based on a systematic scientiﬁc review
of available evidence at the time (1,22),
state that a level of 50 nmol/L (20 ng/mL)
of serum 25(OH)D is needed to maintain
bone health for most individuals. The IOM

report called for additional research to clar-
ify the relation of vitamin D levels with
nonskeletal outcomes (1,22).

The optimal 25(OH)D levels for type
2 diabetes prevention remain unknown.
Epidemiological evidence relating lower
circulating vitamin D levels to hypergly-
cemia, insulin resistance, or type 2 diabetes
primarily derives from cross-sectional re-
ports (4,8–10). Prospective data are lim-
ited and have been inconclusive (36). Our
dose-response curve showed an inverse
and signiﬁcant relation between 25(OH)
D and type 2 diabetes across a broad
range of 25(OH)D levels in diverse popu-
lations. Our results also conﬁrmed that
baseline 25(OH)D levels $50 nmol/L
were signiﬁcantly associated with a lower
risk of type 2 diabetes, although further
studies with higher power are required
to provide more stable estimates of this
association.

The observed inverse association
did not differ by sex, study sample size,

duration of follow-up, diabetes diagnosis
criteria, and 25(OH)D assay methods. An
early pooled analysis of 2 nested case-
control studies of 412 incident cases of
type 2 diabetes and 986 control subjects
found a strong inverse association in men
but not in women (14). However, this ﬁnd-
ing of sex-speciﬁc relation of 25(OH)D
with type 2 diabetes was not conﬁrmed
by subsequently published studies nor
by our meta-analysis. It is likely that
such sex difference resulted from residual
confounding or statistical ﬂuctuation due
to small sample size. Adiposity is another
important covariate in vitamin D–diabetes
relation. The interrelationship between vi-
tamin D status and adiposity is complex
and possibly bidirectional. Increased stor-
age of 25(OH)D in adipose tissue and less
sun exposure due to limited mobility and/
or excessive subcutaneous fat deposits in
obese individuals will lead to low circulat-
ing levels of 25(OH)D (2,3). Conversely,
vitamin D may directly affect adiposity

and other metabolic parameters such as

inﬂammation that mediate the pathway

parameters may be an overadjustment,
possibly underestimating the true associa-
tion. Finally, with the exception of one
study (31), all studies used a single mea-
surement of 25(OH)D at baseline, which
is not a time-integrated measure of vita-
min D status. 25(OH)D was also assayed
using different methods in previous stud-
ies. There was substantial intra- and inter-
assay variation in 25(OH)D levels (38).
However, the summary RR of type 2 di-
abetes in relation to 25(OH)D did not dif-
fer by assay methods.

Our ﬁndings of an inverse relation
between 25(OH)D and type 2 diabetes are
supported by biological evidence that
vitamin D may be implicated in the
pathogenesis of diabetes and its compli-
cations (36,37). A large body of literature
has suggested that optimal vitamin D ho-
meostasis is essential for insulin action
and secretion (2,3), two fundamental fea-
tures in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabe-
tes. Clearly, direct evidence from ongoing
(39) and future clinical trials of higher-
dose vitamin D supplementation is war-
ranted to clarify any beneﬁcial effects of
vitamin D on primary prevention of type
2 diabetes.

Findings from our meta-analysis of
observational studies will augment and
complement ﬁndings from randomized
trials of the effect of vitamin D supple-
ments on type 2 diabetes. Although ran-
domized trials are critical for establishing
cause-and-effect relationships between
vitamin D supplementation and health
outcomes, they will not address all the
potential questions because of their ﬁxed
dose (or at most, a few doses) of vitamin D
and narrow range of 25(OH)D levels
achieved by supplementation. Prospec-
tive observational studies allow us to
assess 25(OH)D thresholds for diabetes
risk across a broad spectrum of 25(OH)D
levels. The largest randomized trial of
vitamin D supplement to date, the Wom-
en’s Health Initiative (WHI) Clinical Trial,
has evaluated vitamin D plus calcium
supplementation for fracture prevention
in .36,000 postmenopausal women
(40). Secondary analysis of the WHI trial
with 33,951 initially nondiabetic women
did not observe any effect from daily in-
take of 1,000 mg elemental calcium plus
400 IU vitamin D3 on incident diabetes
over 7 years of follow-up (40). Of note, a
dose of 400 IU/day vitamin D in the WHI
raised median levels of serum 25(OH)D
from 42.3 to only 54.1 nmol/L (;12
nmol/L), which is below the optimal value
of 75 nmol/L or more for skeletal and
nonskeletal health including type 2 dia-
betes (41). Similarly, secondary analysis
of another large randomized trial, the
Randomized Evaluation of Calcium Or
vitamin D (RECORD) trial, did not observe
any effect from daily intake of 800 IU vi-
tamin D3 on incident diabetes over 2–5
years, although such a daily dose raised
serum 25(OH)D from 38 to 62 nmol/L
on average (42).

Our meta-analysis has some limita-
tions. First, the observational nature of
prospective studies included in our anal-
ysis cannot rule out residual confound-
ing, although the consistency of our
results across multiple strata and sensi-
tivity analyses minimizes the likelihood
that residual confounding explains the
ﬁndings. Second, as in any meta-analysis,
publication bias is possible, although our
visual examination and formal tests did
not suggest the presence of substantial
publication bias. Finally,
limited data
from existing prospective studies lacked
sufﬁcient power to detect potential sex- or
ethnicity-speciﬁc 25(OH)D thresholds or
dose-response relations.

In conclusion, our meta-analysis of
21 prospective studies demonstrates a

signiﬁcant inverse association between
circulating 25(OH)D levels and risk of
incident
type 2 diabetes in a dose-
response manner across a wide spectrum
of 25(OH)D levels. Direct evidence from
future randomized trials is warranted to
clarify a cause-and-effect relationship be-
tween vitamin D and type 2 diabetes.

Epidemiology and Prevention

Red and Processed Meat Consumption and Risk of Incident

Coronary Heart Disease, Stroke, and Diabetes Mellitus

A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis

Renata Micha, RD, PhD; Sarah K. Wallace, BA; Dariush Mozaffarian, MD, DrPH

Background—Meat consumption is inconsistently associated with development of coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke,
and diabetes mellitus, limiting quantitative recommendations for consumption levels. Effects of meat intake on these
different outcomes, as well as of red versus processed meat, may also vary.

Methods and Results—We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of evidence for relationships of red
(unprocessed), processed, and total meat consumption with incident CHD, stroke, and diabetes mellitus. We searched
for any cohort study, case-control study, or randomized trial that assessed these exposures and outcomes in generally
healthy adults. Of 1598 identified abstracts, 20 studies met inclusion criteria, including 17 prospective cohorts and 3
case-control studies. All data were abstracted independently in duplicate. Random-effects generalized least squares
models for trend estimation were used to derive pooled dose-response estimates. The 20 studies included 1 218 380
individuals and 23 889 CHD, 2280 stroke, and 10 797 diabetes mellitus cases. Red meat intake was not associated with
CHD (n⫽4 studies; relative risk per 100-g serving per day⫽1.00; 95% confidence interval, 0.81 to 1.23; P for
heterogeneity⫽0.36) or diabetes mellitus (n⫽5; relative risk⫽1.16; 95% confidence interval, 0.92 to 1.46; P⫽0.25).
Conversely, processed meat intake was associated with 42% higher risk of CHD (n⫽5; relative risk per 50-g serving
per day⫽1.42; 95% confidence interval, 1.07 to 1.89; P⫽0.04) and 19% higher risk of diabetes mellitus (n⫽7; relative
risk⫽1.19; 95% confidence interval, 1.11 to 1.27; P⬍0.001). Associations were intermediate for total meat intake.
Consumption of red and processed meat were not associated with stroke, but only 3 studies evaluated these relationships.
Conclusions—Consumption of processed meats, but not red meats, is associated with higher incidence of CHD and
diabetes mellitus. These results highlight the need for better understanding of potential mechanisms of effects and for
particular focus on processed meats for dietary and policy recommendations. (Circulation. 2010;121:2271-2283.)

Key Words: cardiovascular diseases 䡲 diabetes mellitus 䡲 diet 䡲 meat 䡲 meta-analysis

The 2005 US Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend

that consumption of red and processed meat should be
moderated.1 Such recommendations are in large part derived
from expected effects of saturated fat in meat on low-density
lipoprotein and total cholesterol levels. However, relationships
of meat consumption with disease end points such as coronary
heart disease (CHD), stroke, and type 2 diabetes mellitus are not
well established, with considerably conflicting results in prior
studies.2–19 Thus, sufficient evidence for direct relationships with
chronic cardiometabolic diseases has been lacking to support
more quantitative recommendations about specific consumption
levels of meats or potential differences between unprocessed red
meat (referred to hereafter as simply “red meat”) versus pro-
cessed meats.

Clinical Perspective on p 2283

Red versus processed meats may have some important nutri-
tional differences, such as in contents of calories, specific fats,

sodium, iron, or additives (eg, nitrites), or differences in their
preparation methods (eg, high-temperature commercial cooking)
that could produce differing effects on cardiometabolic risk.
However, potential differences in effects of red meat versus
processed meat consumption on risk of CHD, stroke, or diabetes
mellitus have not been systematically evaluated. In the United
States alone, 1 700 000 new cases of diabetes mellitus,20
600 000 myocardial infarctions, and 780 000 new or recurrent
strokes occur each year.21 Documenting and quantifying the
effects of meat consumption on these outcomes, as well as
potential differences in effects of red versus processed meat, are
of great scientific and public health importance. To address these
important questions and elucidate the conflicting results of prior
studies, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of
the evidence for relationships of red meat, processed meat, and
red and processed meat combined (referred to hereafter as “total
meat”) consumption with risk of CHD, stroke, and diabetes
mellitus.

Methods

Search Strategy
We followed Meta-Analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology22
protocols throughout the design, implementation, analysis, and reporting.
We searched for all prospective or case-control studies or randomized
controlled trials that provided effect estimates for potential associations
of red, processed, or total meat consumption and incidence of CHD,
stroke, total cardiovascular disease (CVD), or diabetes mellitus in
adults. Searches were performed with the use of MEDLINE (see
Methods in the online-only Data Supplement), EMBASE, AGRIS,
AMED, HMIC, PsycINFO, Cochrane Library, Web of Knowledge,
CABI, CINAHL, conference abstracts (ZETOC), Faculty of 1000, gray
literature sources (SIGLE), related articles, hand-searching of reference
lists, and direct author contact. Key words were meat, meat products,
beef, ham, other specific unprocessed red and processed meat subtypes,
cardiovascular diseases, and diabetes mellitus, including the earliest
available online indexing year through March 2009 without language
restrictions. “Red meat” was defined as unprocessed meat from beef,
hamburgers, lamb, pork, or game and excluding poultry, fish, or eggs23;
“processed meat” was defined as any meat preserved by smoking,
curing, or salting or addition of chemical preservatives, such as bacon,
salami, sausages, hot dogs, or processed deli or luncheon meats, and
excluding fish or eggs24; and “total meat” was defined as the total of
these 2 categories. Processed meat was primarily processed red meat,
although in some studies deli meats, a subcategory of processed meats,
may also have included some processed poultry meats that could not be
separately excluded. We excluded a priori studies focused on comparing
only vegetarians versus nonvegetarians because such comparisons could
likely be strongly modified or biased by other differences in diet and
lifestyle behaviors in vegetarians. We also recognized that the lowest
intake category in each of the included studies would include a subset of
individuals (including likely at least some vegetarians) consuming no
red or processed meat. Thus, such individuals were captured in the
included studies but without the higher potential for bias when analyses
were restricted only to special vegetarian populations. We also excluded
a priori cross-sectional or ecological studies; commentaries, general
reviews, or case reports; and studies reporting only crude risk estimates.
Selection of Articles
Of 1598 identified articles, 1505 were excluded on the basis of review
of the title and abstract (Figure 1). Full texts of the 95 remaining
manuscripts were independently assessed in duplicate by 2 investigators

if necessary, group consultation among all

to determine inclusion/exclusion, with differences resolved by consen-
sus or,
investigators.
Seventy-five studies were excluded because they were reviews (n⫽16),
cross-sectional (n⫽7), ecological (n⫽2), conducted in vegetarians
(n⫽10), or repeated publications from the same study (n⫽6); assessed
only overall dietary patterns (n⫽19), only iron intake (n⫽2), or only
animal protein/fat (n⫽1); included poultry in the meat definition
(n⫽7); did not assess incident CHD, stroke, or diabetes mellitus
(n⫽3); reported only crude risk estimates (n⫽1); or included
participants with prevalent disease (n⫽1) (see Methods in the
online-only Data Supplement). Initial inclusion/exclusion adjudica-
tions were 97% concordant. For 29 studies, authors were contacted
to request missing data or clarify meat definitions used; sufficient
responses were received for 23 of 29 studies to characterize the
exposure or missing data. For example, several articles initially
appeared to report findings separately for red meat versus processed
meat but on detailed review or direct contact were found to have
included processed meat in the red meat category, requiring direct
contact to obtain risk estimates for unprocessed red meat alone.
Data Extraction
For each of the 20 final identified studies, data were extracted indepen-
dently and in duplicate by 2 investigators, including years the study was
performed and reported, study design, sample size, definition(s) of meat
intake and disease outcomes, study location, inclusion and exclusion
criteria, duration of follow-up, covariates adjusted for, and adjusted risk
estimates and confidence intervals (CIs). When ⬎1 multivariable model
was reported, risk estimates with the greatest control for potential
confounders were extracted. If multivariable models were reported with
and without additional adjustment for variables that could be either
confounders or intermediates (eg, high cholesterol), the multivariable
model without such variables was selected. If the only multivariable
model included such variables, this was selected in preference to crude
or minimally adjusted models. Accepted standardized quality scores for
observational studies are not available. Therefore, quality assessment
was performed by evaluating and scoring 5 design criteria on an integer
scale (0 or 1, with 1 being better), including appropriateness and
reporting of inclusion and exclusion criteria, assessment of exposure,
assessment of outcome, control of confounding, and evidence of bias.
These scores were summed; quality scores from 0 to 3 were considered
lower quality, and scores of 4 to 5 were considered higher quality.
Differences in data extracted or quality assessment scores between
investigators were unusual and were resolved by consensus. Missing

data or definitions were resolved by direct contact with authors as
described above. To provide some perspective in regard to why
cardiometabolic effects of red versus processed meats might differ, we
evaluated nationally representative average nutrient and preservative
contents of red and processed meats consumed in the United States. To
estimate average nutrient qualities, we analyzed data from the 2005–
2006 US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES), accounting for NHANES sampling and weighting strate-
gies to provide nationally representative estimates25,26 (see Methods in
the online-only Data Supplement). Foods consumed in this US survey
were grouped to match the definitions of our meta-analysis for red and
processed meat. Preservative contents were obtained from a recent
report of published nitrate, nitrite, and nitrosamine contents of foods
commonly consumed in the United States26 and applied directly to
meats in the NHANES database with the use of methods similar to those

used for nutrients. We recognized that such nutrient data may not be
fully generalizable outside the United States, but comparable data were
not available from Europe, Asia, or Australia.
Statistical Analysis
All included studies were observational and reported either relative risks
(RRs; prospective cohorts) or odds ratios (case-control studies) across
several different categories of meat intake. Odds ratios were assumed to
approximate RRs24; we also performed analyses limited to prospective
cohorts only. The midpoint in each category was used to define median
intake in that category, with standardization across studies to a serving
size of 100 g (3.5 oz) for red and total meat and 50 g (1.8 oz) for
processed meat. For studies with an open-ended highest category that
did not report median intake, we assumed that the difference from the
lowest range to the median was equivalent to the same difference in the

closest adjacent category. To maximize use of the data to calculate
pooled dose response, summary estimates of log-linear dose-response
regressions were made with the use of random-effects generalized least
squares models for trend estimation27 (GLST in STATA [StataCorp,
College Station, Tex]). This method is ideal for meta-analyses of studies
having multiple risk estimates per study because it accounts for
appropriate variance-covariance relationships between and within stud-
ies. Covariance was fit with the use of total numbers of cases and of
subjects (controls plus cases) for case-control data or person-years for
cohort data, at each level of exposure. Evidence for statistical hetero-
geneity between studies was tested with goodness of fit (␹2). General-
ized least squares models for trend take advantage of the multiple data
points in all studies simultaneously to provide the best overall pooled
estimate of dose response in a single (1-stage) estimation. To construct
funnel plots and evaluate the Begg adjusted-rank correlation test for

publication bias,28 explore potential sources of heterogeneity, and
visually display the individual study results in Forest plots, we also
performed 2-stage estimation: Separate generalized least squares models
for trend were evaluated for each study to derive study-specific
log-linear dose responses (log RR), and then each study-specific log RR
was pooled in a second generalized least squares model for trend. Our
prespecified primary outcome was based on the 1-stage estimation that
better estimates the variance-covariance matrix by using all available ␤
coefficients in each study rather than the 2-stage estimation that first
derives a single ␤coefficient per study and then estimates the variance-
covariance matrix. We performed sensitivity analyses, when data were
available, for subgroups of specific processed meats. Prespecified
potential sources of heterogeneity explored were study location (United
States, Asia/Australia, Europe), degree of covariate adjustment (mini-

Results

The 20 identified investigations included 17 prospective
cohorts studies and 3 case-control studies conducted in the
United States (n⫽11), Europe (n⫽6), Asia (n⫽2), and Aus-
tralia (n⫽1) and included 1 218 380 unique individuals in
whom 23 889 cases of CHD, 2280 cases of stroke, and 10 797
cases of diabetes mellitus were identified (Table 1). No
randomized controlled trials of red, processed, or total meat
consumption and incidence of CHD, stroke, or diabetes
mellitus were identified. Reported categories of meat con-
sumption typically ranged from never or less than once a
month (lowest category of intake) to variable highest catego-
ries of
intake. Averaged across studies, consumption
(mean⫾SD) levels in the lowest versus highest category of
intake were 1.1⫾1.1 versus 8.3⫾2.7 servings per week for
red, 0.4⫾0.8 versus 5.7⫾3.9 servings per week for processed,
and 1.8⫾1.7 versus 10.5⫾4.2 servings per week for total
meat intake, respectively. Most studies used validated multi-
item food frequency questionnaires to quantify meat con-
sumption; some used interview-based5,10,29 or fewer-item
food frequency2 questionnaires. Total numbers of participants
(n⫽342 to 322 263) and events (n⫽51 to 14 221) varied
widely between studies. Extent of covariate adjustment also
varied, especially for dietary variables that were often not
controlled for3,4,6,8,13,17 (and J. Kro¨ger, MSc, unpublished
data, 2009). Approximately half of the studies included
variables that could be confounders or intermediates (eg, lipid
levels) in addition to sociodemographic and/or dietary vari-
ables.5,7,9,10,13,15,17,29 Four studies reported how red versus
processed meat intake was associated with other dietary and
lifestyle factors at baseline.7,16,18 Relationships with these
other risk factors were similar for red versus processed meat.
For example, higher consumption of both red and processed
meat tended to be similarly associated with current smoking,
higher body mass index, family history of diabetes mellitus,
hypertension, higher education and income level, and higher
intake of total energy, total fat, saturated, monounsaturated,
and polyunsaturated fats, dietary cholesterol, and protein. In
addition, red and processed meat consumption levels were
similarly associated with less physical activity, multivitamin
use, prevalence of high cholesterol, glycemic load, and intake
of carbohydrate, fiber, and magnesium. For all but 3 of the
studies,4,10,12 the reported exposure-outcome assessment was
a prespecified primary or secondary aim.

Meat Intake and CHD
Nine studies provided 16 separate estimates for relationships
of consumption of red, processed, or total meat and incident
CHD (Figure 2).
Red Meat
Consumption of red meat was not associated with CHD
(RR⫽1.00 per serving per day; 95% CI, 0.81 to 1.23), with no
statistically significant between-study heterogeneity (P⫽0.36)

(Figure 2, top panel). Findings were similar in analyses restricted
to cohort studies2,4,5 (RR⫽0.92; 95% CI, 0.74 to 1.15) or studies
for which this exposure-outcome assessment was prespeci-
fied2,5,6 (RR⫽0.95; 95% CI, 0.66 to 1.35).
Processed Meat
Each serving per day of processed meat was associated with
42% higher risk of CHD (RR⫽1.42; 95% CI, 1.07 to 1.89)
(Figure 2, middle panel). Statistical between-study heterogeneity
was present (P⫽0.04), not accounted for by any of our prespeci-
fied sources of heterogeneity. For all included studies, this
exposure-outcome assessment was prespecified. Restricting the
analysis to cohort studies2,3,5,7 resulted in similar findings, with
44% higher CHD risk per serving per day (RR⫽1.44; 95% CI,
1.07 to 1.95). Restricting the analysis to US studies3,7 resulted in
similar findings (RR⫽1.40; 95% CI, 1.03 to 1.91). With the
exclusion of 1 large US study that evaluated only total CVD
mortality3 (not CHD alone), each serving per day of processed
meat consumption was associated with nearly 2-fold higher risk
of CHD (RR⫽1.90; 95% CI, 1.00 to 3.62), with no evidence for
between-study heterogeneity (P⫽0.29).
Total Meat
Total meat consumption was associated with a trend toward
higher CHD risk (RR⫽1.27; 95% CI, 0.94 to 1.72) (Figure 2,
bottom panel). Between-study heterogeneity was present
(P⫽0.002), observed to be due to extreme findings in the
smallest study,9 which was also the only case-control study.
With the exclusion of this study, total meat consumption was
associated with 25% higher CHD risk (RR⫽1.25; 95% CI,
1.21 to 1.29). These findings were largely driven by 1 study
that assessed only total CVD mortality3 (not CHD alone);
with the exclusion of this study, a significant association was
not confirmed between total meat
intake and CHD risk
(RR⫽1.96; 95% CI, 0.67 to 5.70), but CIs were broad.
Findings restricted to studies3,7,9 with prespecified aims to
assess this exposure-outcome relationship were similar to the
overall pooled estimate (RR⫽1.31; 95% CI, 0.92 to 1.85).

Meat Intake and Diabetes Mellitus
Seven studies provided 15 separate estimates for relationship
of red, processed, or total meat consumption and incidence of
diabetes mellitus (Figure 3).
Red Meat
Consumption of red meat was not significantly associated
with incident diabetes mellitus (pooled RR⫽1.16 per serving
per day; 95% CI, 0.92 to 1.46) (Figure 3,
top panel).
Statistical heterogeneity between studies was not evident
(P⫽0.25). All included studies were cohorts, for which the
exposure-outcome assessments were prespecified.
Processed Meat
Seven studies evaluated the relationship of processed meat
consumption and incident diabetes mellitus (Figure 3, middle
panel). All studies were cohorts for which this exposure-
outcome assessment was prespecified. In the overall pooled
estimate, each serving per day was associated with 19%
higher risk (RR⫽1.19; 95% CI, 1.11 to 1.27). Significant
between-study heterogeneity was present (P⬍0.001), identi-
fied in metaregression as related to study location (P⫽0.03).

Evaluation for between-study heterogeneity was limited by
the few studies and estimates.

Publication Bias
Evidence for publication bias was not apparent for most of
these exposure-outcome relationships on the basis of either
visual inspection of the funnel plot or by the Begg test, a
statistical analog of the visual funnel plot (Figure I in the
online-only Data Supplement), although such tests have
limited statistical power in the setting of relatively few
studies. The funnel plot suggested possible publication bias in
reporting of studies for processed meat intake and risk of
CHD; the Begg test did not achieve statistical significance
(P⫽0.57), and excluding the smallest study with the most
unbalanced results on the funnel plot5 had little effect on
results (RR⫽1.37; 95% CI, 1.05 to 1.79). The funnel plot also
suggested possible publication bias in reporting of studies for
red meat intake and diabetes mellitus risk, but the Begg test
did not achieve statistical significance (P⫽0.62); red meat

consumption was not significantly associated with diabetes
mellitus risk in the overall pooled result (Figure 3, top panel);
and excluding the 2 smallest studies with the most unbal-
anced results on the funnel plot14 (and J. Kro¨ger, MSc,
unpublished data, 2009) did not appreciably alter these results
(RR⫽1.05; 95% CI, 0.73 to 1.49).

Nutritional Qualities of Red and Processed Meats
On the basis of nationally representative data on the types and
quantities of meats consumed in the United States, both similar-
ities and differences were identified in average nutrient and/or
preservative contents of red versus processed meats (Table 2).
Per 50-g serving, processed meats contained modestly higher
calories and percent energy from fat and lower percent energy
from protein compared with 50 g of red meats. Consistent
with lower protein content, processed meats also contained
less iron. Processed meats contained relatively similar satu-
rated fat and slightly lower cholesterol, the latter perhaps
related to some processed meats being derived from pork
and/or lower-cholesterol deli meats. Relatively small differ-
ences were present
in contents of monounsaturated fat,
polyunsaturated fat, or potassium. Largest differences were
seen in levels of sodium, with processed meats containing

Discussion

Whereas meat consumption is commonly considered a risk
factor for cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, our findings
indicate that the effects and magnitudes may vary depending on
both the type of meat consumed and the outcome considered.
This first systematic review and meta-analysis of these relation-
ships, including 1 218 380 individuals from 10 countries on 4
continents with 23 889 cases of CHD, 2280 cases of stroke, and
10 797 cases of diabetes mellitus, provides the most robust and
reliable evidence to date of how unprocessed red and processed
meat consumption may influence risk of cardiometabolic dis-
eases. Consumption of processed meats was associated with
significantly higher incidence of both CHD and diabetes melli-
tus, with 42% and 19% higher risk, respectively, per 50-g
serving per day. In contrast, consumption of unprocessed red
meats was not associated with CHD and was associated with a
nonsigificant trend toward higher risk of diabetes mellitus.
Associations were intermediate for total meat intake.

Our extensive search of multiple databases and direct
contact with authors resulted in the identification of 17
prospective cohorts and 3 case-control studies; no random-

ized controlled trials were identified that evaluated effects of
red, processed, or total meat consumption on CVD or
diabetes mellitus events. This is not surprising when it is
considered that trials of such effects can be challenging and
costly to conduct, with limitations of nonblinding and non-
compliance over the long periods of time required to detect
clinical end points. In this setting, the best available evidence
is derived from long-term prospective cohorts of disease end
points such as those identified here, although such studies can
be limited by misclassification and residual confounding.
Retrospective case-control studies may have additional po-
tential limitations (eg, recall and selection bias).

Thus, each of these individual studies has potential limita-
tions, and our findings should be interpreted in that context. On
the other hand, this represents the most complete worldwide
evidence to date of the potential effects of red and processed
meat consumption on incidence of CHD, stroke, and diabetes
mellitus. We also performed multiple sensitivity analyses to
evaluate the extent to which our findings might vary depending
on underlying study design (cohort versus case-control), pres-
ence or absence of prespecified analyses, geographic region (eg,
United States versus other), overrepresentation of 1 large study,
or other identified sources of heterogeneity. Generally, findings
were consistent in each of these sensitivity analyses and similar

to the overall pooled results. Thus, although limitations of the
individual studies should not be ignored, our results provide the
best current evidence for how red, processed, and total meat
consumption relate to CHD, stroke, and diabetes mellitus and
highlight specific gaps in knowledge that are essential for policy
decisions relating to these important diet-disease relationships.
For example, our findings of different relationships of red
versus processed meat consumption with incident CHD and
diabetes mellitus events support the need to better characterize
which particular components of meats may increase cardiomet-
abolic risk. At least in the United States, where most of the
studies were performed, processed meats contain, on average,
similar saturated fat and lower cholesterol and iron compared
with red meats, suggesting that differences in these constituents
may not account for different associations with disease risk.
Other constituents may be relevant in determining health effects.
In particular, the observed substantially higher sodium and
nitrate preservative levels in processed meats could plausibly
contribute to increased CVD and diabetes mellitus risk and
account, at least in part, for the present findings. Dietary sodium
significantly increases blood pressure,30 –32 and habitual con-
sumption may also worsen arterial compliance and promote
vascular stiffness.33 Nitrates and their byproducts (eg, peroxyni-
trite) experimentally promote atherosclerosis and vascular dys-
function,34 reduce insulin secretion,35,36 and impair glucose
tolerance,36 and streptozotocin, a nitrosamine-related compound,
is a known diabetogenic compound.37 In observational studies in
children, nitrites and nitrous compounds are associated with type
1 diabetes mellitus,38,39 and nitrite concentrations in adults have
been used as a biomarker of endothelial dysfunction40 and

impaired insulin response.41 Differences in types of foods
commonly replaced when individuals consume red versus pro-
cessed meats could also partly account for their different
associations with risk.

Our study had several strengths. We reviewed multiple
databases broadly and systematically for all investigations of
meat consumption and incidence of CHD, stroke, or diabetes
mellitus, making it likely that we identified all major pub-
lished reports. Multiple authors were contacted directly and
clarified findings or provided additional data, minimizing
both misclassification and effects of publication bias. Study
inclusion/exclusion and data extraction were performed inde-
pendently and in duplicate by 2 investigators, increasing the
validity of results. Studies were identified from the United
States, Europe, Asia, and Australia, increasing generalizabil-
ity. Large numbers of disease end points were identified,
providing substantial statistical power to detect clinically
meaningful associations. We used generalized least squares
models for trend estimation, which explicitly assesses dose
response rather than simply categorical comparisons. We
carefully identified and separately evaluated red, processed,
and total meat consumption; in particular, relatively few prior
reports have separately considered unprocessed red meats.
Indeed, several key prior reports on red meat consumption
included processed meats in this category,3,7,8,19,24 limiting
inference on effects of unprocessed red meats alone. For
example, a systematic review by the World Cancer Research
Fund and American Institute for Cancer Research concluded
that both red and processed meat consumption increased
colorectal cancer24; however, red meats in several of the
included studies were the sum of unprocessed and processed
meats. Interestingly, their identified relationship of red (com-
monly total, ie, unprocessed red plus processed) meat intake
with colorectal cancer (22% higher risk per 100 g/d) was
approximately half that for processed meat alone (46% higher
risk per 100 g/d), consistent with our results that much of the
association between total meat intake and CHD and diabetes
mellitus may result from effects of processed meats.

Potential limitations should also be considered. As with all
meta-analyses, analyses were restricted to available published
and unpublished data. Most of these studies did not separately
assess extensive details about specific subcategories of deli
meats consumed. Processed meats may have included small
amounts of processed poultry, which could theoretically have
smaller effects and cause underestimation of effects of
processed red meats. We did not have data on cooking
methods that could alter health effects of red or processed
meats.42– 44 Both red and processed meats represent somewhat
heterogeneous categories, and thus our findings should be
interpreted as the average overall association rather than the
particular effect of 1 specific subtype of such meats. This
interpretation would be similar, for example, to analyses or
meta-analyses of effects of other classes of dietary factors,
such as fruits, vegetables, fish, whole grains, and alcohol. A
recent meta-analysis of relationships between meat consump-
tion and diabetes mellitus has been reported45; this study also
found higher risk with processed meat intake but included
crude (unadjusted) risk estimates and also did not separately
evaluate unprocessed red meats.

All studies were observational, and residual confounding
by imprecisely or unmeasured factors cannot be excluded. In
particular, several studies did not adjust for other dietary
habits or socioeconomic status. Thus, associations of pro-
cessed meat consumption with diabetes mellitus or CHD
could relate to generally less healthy diet or lifestyle rather
than causal effects of processed meats. Conversely, most
studies adjusted for at least several major demographic and
other risk factors; the reported potential confounding factors
related to red versus processed meat consumption were
similar, yet only the latter was related to risk; and specific
ingredients in processed meats (eg, salt, other preservatives)
provide biological plausibility for the observed relationships.
Several studies adjusted for factors that could be either
confounders or intermediates in the causal pathway, which
could potentially attenuate the observed risk estimates be-
tween meat consumption and disease risk. We standardized
all servings to 100 g for red and total meat and 50 g for
processed meat, and risks could vary when serving sizes are
lower or higher. Representative nutrient and preservative data
were available only for the United States, and such values
should be considered illustrative rather than definitive for
other countries. Too few studies were present to formally
exclude publication bias with sufficient statistical power. On
the other hand, our extensive direct contact with multiple
authors and inclusion of unpublished findings minimizes the
potential impact of publication bias. Notably, if publication
bias were present, it might cause overestimation of harmful
associations between processed meats and diabetes mellitus
or CHD (ie, identified harmful associations might more likely
be published) but would unlikely contribute to null associa-
tions between red meats and CHD or diabetes mellitus or
between meats and stroke (ie, publication bias is unlikely to
favor reporting of null associations).

Our findings demonstrate that consumption of processed
meat in particular is associated with incidence of CHD and
diabetes mellitus, highlighting the importance of separate
consideration of health effects, underlying mechanisms, and
policy implications of different types of processed versus
unprocessed meats. Our findings also identify critical gaps in
our understanding of how meat consumption influences
cardiometabolic risk, including potential effects of red meat
consumption on diabetes mellitus or CHD; of any meat
consumption on stroke risk; and of specific ingredients that
could be underlying these relationships. On the basis of our
evaluation of average nutrient and preservative contents of
red and processed meats, constituents in meats other than fats
may be especially relevant to health effects. On the basis of
this systematic review and meta-analysis of all available data,
future research should carefully distinguish between different
types of meats, and policy measures for improving cardiomet-
abolic health should focus particularly on reducing processed
meat consumption, including consideration of recommenda-
tions for specific quantitative limits. These findings are
particularly timely for current efforts to update the US
Dietary Guidelines for Americans, which are also often a
reference for other countries around the world.

CLINICAL PERSPECTIVE

US dietary-guidelines recommend “eating less” red and processed meat. For cardiovascular disease, these recommenda-
tions are based largely on expected effects on blood cholesterol of saturated fat and dietary cholesterol in meats. However,
relationships of meat intake with cardiometabolic disease outcomes, including coronary heart disease, stroke, and diabetes
mellitus, are not well established. Additionally, few studies have separately evaluated unprocessed red versus processed
meats, for which nutritional differences could produce different health effects. We systematically reviewed and pooled all
available worldwide data on relationships between meat consumption and risk of coronary heart disease, stroke, or diabetes
mellitus. Twenty studies were identified including 1 218 380 individuals from the United States, Europe, Australia, and
Asia. When all data were pooled, consumption of unprocessed red meat (eg, unprocessed meat from beef, pork, lamb) was
not associated with risk of coronary heart disease or diabetes mellitus. In contrast, each daily serving of processed meat
(eg, bacon, hot dog, salami) was associated with 42% higher coronary heart disease and 19% higher diabetes mellitus risk.
No associations were seen with stroke, but only 3 studies evaluated these relationships. When nationally representative US
data on average types of meats consumed were analyzed, unprocessed red and processed meats contained relatively similar
saturated fat and dietary cholesterol; processed meats contained much higher salt and nitrate preservatives. Our findings
suggest that unprocessed red and processed meats have differing relationships with cardiometabolic outcomes and also
suggest that differences in preservative contents, rather than fats, could at least partly account for these findings. Future
research should separately consider potential health effects and underlying mechanisms of unprocessed versus processed
meats, and current clinical and policy efforts should especially focus on reducing processed meat consumption.

 Rate of digestion of foods and postprandial glycaemia in
 normal and diabetic subjects

 DAVID J A JENKINS, THOMAS M S WOLEVER, RODNEY H TAYLOR, HAMID GHAFARI,
 ALEXANDRA L JENKINS, HELEN BARKER, MARK J A JENKINS

 Summary and conclusions
 Carbohydrate portions (2 g) of lentils, soya beans, and
 wholemeal bread were incubated for three hours with
 human digestive juices and the effect of digestibility on
 blood glucose examined. Lentils and soya beans released
 only 39% and 8% respectively of the sugars and oligo
 saccharides liberated from bread. In healthy volunteers
 50 g carbohydrate portions of cooked lentils and soya
 beans raised blood glucose concentrations by only 42%
 (p <0001) and 14% (p <0001) of the bread value. There
 was a similar response in diabetics.

 These results suggest that rate of digestion might be an
 important factor determining the rise in blood glucose
 concentration after a meal and that supplementing
 chemical analysis with in-vitro and in-vivo food testing
 might permit identification of especially useful foods for
 diabetics.

 Introduction
 Studies suggest that the postprandial rise in blood glucose
 concentration may be influenced by the rate of carbohydrate
 absorption.1 Work with various dietary fibres1 and food starches2
 emphasised that great differences in rates of digestion and
 absorption may exist between foods. Hence foods that liberate
 their carbohydrate slowly might be of use to diabetics by reducing
 the rise in blood glucose values after a meal.
 We have examined digestibility and the effect on blood
 glucose of two different types of foods?namely, bread, a cereal
 product and traditionally a staple food in the West; and two
 leguminous seeds, lentils and soya beans, representing foods
 much more commonly eaten in those parts of the world where
 diabetes is less common.

 Methods
 IN-VITRO STUDIES

 Carbohydrate portions (2 g) of cooked soya beans and lentils, ground
 to a smooth paste, and finely crumbed wholemeal bread (see table I)
 were mixed separately with 2-5 ml fresh pooled human saliva and
 7-5 ml human postprandial jejunal juice (Lundh test-juice pooled
 from samples of mean tryptic activity exceeding 15 IU/1 and stored
 at ? 20?C). Distilled water was added to the bread and lentils to make
 the final volume of all foods up to 30 ml. Food and digestive juices
 were then mixed well and placed in dialysis bags made of 13 cm
 strips of dialysis tubing (Visking size 9-36/32", Medicell International,
 London). Each bag was suspended in separate stirred water baths
 containing 800 ml distilled water at 37?C. Other experiments with
 isotonic phosphate buffer pH 7-25 gave similar results. Aliquots of
 dialysates were taken at 0, 1, 2, and 3 hours for analysis of glucose,
 maltose, and oligosaccharides. Glucose was analysed by a standard
 enzymatic technique.3 Maltose and oligosaccharides were analysed
 together as glucose3 after acid hydrolysis with an equal volume of
 10M HC1 for one hour at 75?C and neutralisation with NaOH. We

 find that with this method a solution of maltose 10 mmol/1 is com
 pletely hydrolysed to glucose.

 Further tests were undertaken with saliva and jejunal juice in
 activated by boiling so that allowances could be made for free glucose
 already in the foods or Lundh juice. Also 3 mmol of either glucose or
 maltose was substituted for the enzyme solutions in the dialysis bags
 to allow the potential trapping of sugars by the three foods to be
 measured. The proportion trapped together with the value for the
 carbohydrate liberated into the dialysate by enzymatic digestion
 allowed the total amount of starch digested to be calculated.

 Figure 1 shows the appearance of the products of carbohydrate
 digestion measured as glucose in the dialysate over three hours for the
 three foods tested. By three hours the values for lentils and soya beans
 were lower than for bread by 61% and 92% respectively. For bread
 10% of the digested carbohydrate was glucose, and for lentils and
 soya the figures were 0% and 77% respectively, the remainder being
 maltose and oligosaccharides.

 In the sugar-trapping experiments soya beans reduced the mean
 output of maltose and glucose at three hours by 60% of the control
 and lentils by 35%, while wholemeal bread was without effect.

 From the data on both the enzymatic liberation of sugars and

 oligosaccharides and the trapping effect of foods, the proportion of
 each 2 g carbohydrate portion digested at three hours was 27% for
 bread, 15% for lentils, and 6% for soya (fig 2).

 Made up to 30 ml with digestive enzymes (10 ml) and distilled water.

 NORMAL AND DIABETIC VOLUNTEERS

 Groups of six healthy volunteers drawn from a pool of eight (three
 women, five men; mean age 28?2 years; 100?3% ideal body
 weight4) were given 50 g carbohydrate portions of soya beans or
 lentils, which were compared with a 50 g portion of wholemeal bread.
 For palatability all meals also contained 120 g skinned and pipped
 tomatoes and a sufficient volume of tea (minimum 250 ml) with 50 ml
 milk to bring the meal water content to at least 600 ml. Bread and
 bean breakfasts were eaten over 10 or 15 minutes in random order
 after an overnight fast. Finger-prick blood samples were taken for
 glucose analysis5 at 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, and 120 minutes (see fig 3).
 Six diabetics (four women, two men; mean age 43 ?5 years; 99 ?3%
 ideal body weight, five on insulin 30 ?4 U/day, one on diet alone)
 took a mixed meal of soya beans and lentils to compare with whole
 meal bread. Lentils, being richer in carbohydrate, were taken with
 the soya beans to reduce the volume of this meal. The carbo
 hydrate content of the meals was adjusted to the patient's normal
 intake at breakfast, and the protein and fat content of the beans
 was balanced as closely as possible by adding Edam and cottage
 cheese to the bread meal. The volume of tea, containing 50 ml milk,
 was given according to individual preference and was the same for
 both bread and bean meals.

 Morning insulin doses were given at the same time before each

 meals (table II) were calculated from food tables.6 7 In the case of both

 TEST MEALS

 The meals were well received. Normal subjects finished the bread
 and lentils comfortably within 10-15 minutes. Two subjects did not
 take the full amount of soya beans in the allotted time and, for
 comparison, subsequently took bread meals of equivalent carbohydrate
 content. The diabetics, who took the same amount of carbohydrate as

 contained in their normal breakfasts, had no difficulty in eating the
 composite meals in the prescribed time. The mean fasting blood
 glucose concentration for the normal volunteers ranged from 4-1 to
 4-3 mmol/1 (73-9 to 77-5 mg/100 ml) for the four sets of tests, and the
 means for the two diabetic meals were 11-4 and 11-8 mmol/1 (205-4
 and 212-6 mg/100 ml). In both the normal and diabetic subjects the
 rise in blood glucose concentrations after legumes was much less than
 after bread. Figures 3 and 4 show the significance of differences at
 each time. In normal subjects the area under the glucose curve for
 lentils was only 42% (p< 0-001) and for soya 14% (p< 0-001) com
 pared with the bread meal (fig 3). Similarly in the diabetics the glucose
 area of the composite soya and lentil meal was reduced to 28%
 (p<0002)(fig4).

 Discussion

 Our results support the concept that the rate of digestion of
 foods may be important in determining the extent to which they
 raise the blood glucose concentration in normal and diabetic
 people.1

 The use of the dialysis system was an attempt to simulate

 human luminal digestion. In man salivary and pancreatic
 amylase cleaves a-l,4-glucose linkages in starch, liberating
 maltose, maltotriose, a-limit dextrins (glucose polymers with
 terminal a-1,6 linkages), and a relatively small amount of
 glucose. Maltose, maltotriose, and a-limit dextrins are then
 hydrolysed at the brush border during absorption in a process
 that is not rate-limiting.8 Measuring these products of digestion
 gave dramatic evidence of a difference between legumes and
 bread and suggested that in-vivo leguminous carbohydrate
 would be digested much more slowly than bread. Great variation

 various cereal sources has already been described,2 but until now
 there have been no reports on the effect of their digestion in
 vitro.

 Also other food components such as dietary fibre may protect
 starch from enzymatic attack, while both fibre and starch may
 trap the products of digestion, so slowing their liberation and
 absorption. With cooked foods our dialysis studies showed the
 ability of lentils and soya beans to trap glucose and maltose,
 while wholemeal bread had no effect.

 Similar conclusions on the ability of certain forms of fibre to

 trap sugars have come from studies in which volunteers took
 glucose and xylose mixed with viscous types of dietary fibre?
 namely, guar and tragacanth?obtained from leguminous
 plants.1 These fibre preparations flattened the rise in blood
 glucose concentrations and delayed urinary xylose excretion.

 Flatter blood glucose responses also raise the question of

 malabsorption. Detailed studies of guar using xylose1 and
 paracetamol9 as markers, however, showed that guar did not
 reduce the amount of these substances absorbed but merely
 prolonged the time course of absorption. Furthermore, if
 malabsorption was responsible for the low blood glucose values
 seen here then over 25 g carbohydrate would have to be lost to
 the colon after each bean meal, which would be likely to result
 in severe abdominal symptoms. The lack of symptoms in our
 normal and diabetic volunteers during the 24 hours after their
 bean meals therefore argues against malabsorption. On the other
 hand, the mild flatulence sometimes noticed after eating

 leguminous seeds is more likely to result from colonie fermen
 tation of such unabsorbable sugars as raffinose and stachyose.
 These are not included in food tables under available carbo
 hydrate and so did not form part of the calculated carbohydrate
 used in our studies.

 We thank Dr T D R Hockaday, Dr E M Jepson, and Dr S McHardy

 Young for permission to study their patients, and the patients for their
 collaboration and suggestions. The work was supported by the British
 Diabetic Association and the Medical Research Council.

 In parts of the world where diabetes is less common a sub
 stantial proportion of the daily carbohydrate and protein intake
 may come from leguminous seeds. In India lentils are eaten
 regularly as dahl together with other leguminous seeds?for
 example, chick peas?while the soya bean has been cultivated
 and used for millennia in south-east Asia, China, and Japan. In
 contrast, in contemporary Western diets wheat as bread,
 breakfast cereals, pasta, biscuits, pastry, cakes, etc provides the
 major proportion of the daily starch intake. Nevertheless, this
 has not always been so, and in the past legumes may have
 played a much more important part in the European diet, at
 one time being eaten regularly in Lent, and still being important
 dietary constituents in southern Italy10 and parts of Spain.

 A change of diet making use of more leguminous "lente
 carbohydrate" sources would allow higher carbohydrate diets to
 be eaten with relative exclusion of fat. Such changes would
 probably result in lower fasting serum cholesterol concentrations
 and smaller rises in postprandial blood glucose values. These
 changes might help to reduce morbidity and mortality from both
 diabetes and arterial disease towards levels seen in communities
 where more slow-release carbohydrates are eaten.

 Our results therefore suggested that "slow release" or "lente

 carbohydrate" in leguminous seeds resulted in flatter blood
 glucose responses than would otherwise be predicted for a given
 carbohydrate intake. Further in-vitro studies of digestibility of
 foods, especially those eaten by communities where diabetes is
 rare, may provide useful information not only for constructing
 diabetic diets but to help shape dietary advice in general.

 Smoking habits of men and women

 MAHRUSSELL, C WILSON, C TAYLOR, C D BAKER

 Summary and conclusions
 The smoking habits of 1501 cigarette smokers attending
 28 general practitioners in five group practices in London
 were assessed. Prevalence of smoking, daily cigarette
 consumption, and the use of cigars, untipped cigarettes,
 and hand-rolled cigarettes were lower in the women.
 After controlling for consumption the proportions of
 men and women who smoked every day were similar.
 Women who smoked 20 or more a day were similar to
 men in their self-reported inhaling habits and use of
 low-nicotine cigarettes.

 The results suggest that women differ from men in
 those aspects of smoking that are determined pre
 dominantly by social factors but that their smoking
 habits become similar when pharmacological motivation
 takes over. This apparently occurs when consumption
 reaches about 20 cigarettes a day, when smoking almost
 inevitably becomes a regular event and the sex differences
 disappear.

 Introduction

 For several years there has been a steady decline in the preva
 lence of cigarette smoking in men, but not in women.1 Among
 women smokers there has been a steady increase in daily
 cigarette consumption, and women have also tended to start
 smoking at an increasingly early age. Recently there has been
 concern that they may be less successful than men in giving up
 smoking.2 Our understanding of the differences in smoking
 habits between men and women is incomplete. This is partly
 because some of the major surveys?for example, that of
 McKennell and Thomas3?have not focused sufficiently on the
 sex differences.

 During a study of a representative sample of general prac
 titioners' patients4 we found the prevalence of cigarette smoking
 to be 43% in the men and 34% in the women (Russell et al*
 and unpublished observations). We now describe the smoking
 habits of 1501 cigarette smokers in this sample and analyse the
 similarities and differences between men and women.

Background

A B S T R A C T

The aim of diabetes management is to normalise blood glucose levels, since improved blood glucose control is associated with reduction
in development, and progression, of complications. Nutritional factors affect blood glucose levels, however there is currently no universal
approach to the optimal dietary treatment for diabetes. There is controversy about how useful the glycaemic index (GI) is in diabetic
meal planning. Improved glycaemic control through diet could minimise medications, lessen risk of diabetic complications, improve
quality of life and increase life expectancy.

Objectives

To assess the effects of low glycaemic index, or low glycaemic load, diets on glycaemic control in people with diabetes.

Search methods

We performed electronic searches of The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL with no language restriction.

Selection criteria

We assessed randomised controlled trials of four weeks or longer that compared a low glycaemic index, or low glycaemic load, diet with
a higher glycaemic index, or load, or other diet for people with either type 1 or 2 diabetes mellitus, whose diabetes was not already
optimally controlled.

Data collection and analysis

Two reviewers independently extracted data on study population, intervention and outcomes for each included study, using standardised
data extraction forms.

Main results

Eleven relevant randomised controlled trials involving 402 participants were identiﬁed. There was a signiﬁcant decrease in the glycated
haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) parallel group of trials, the weighted mean difference (WMD) was -0.5% with a 95% conﬁdence interval
(CI) of - 0.9 to -0.1, P = 0.02; and in the cross-over group of trials the WMD was -0.5% with a 95% CI of -1.0 to -0.1, P = 0.03.
Episodes of hypoglycaemia were signiﬁcantly fewer with low compared to high GI diet in one trial (difference of -0.8 episodes per
patient per month, P < 0.01), and proportion of participants reporting more than 15 hyperglycaemic episodes per month was lower
for low-GI diet compared to measured carbohydrate exchange diet in another study (35% versus 66%, P = 0.006). No study reported
on mortality, morbidity or costs.

Authors’ conclusions

A low-GI diet can improve glycaemic control in diabetes without compromising hypoglycaemic events.

Low glycaemic index, or low glycaemic load, diets for diabetes mellitus

Nutritional factors affect blood glucose levels, however there is currently no universal approach to the optimal dietary strategy for
diabetes. Different carbohydrate foods have different effects on blood glucose and can be ranked by the overall effect on the blood glucose
levels using the so-called glycaemic index. By contributing a gradual supply of glucose to the bloodstream and hence stimulating lower
insulin release, low glycaemic index foods, such as lentils, beans and oats, may contribute to improved glycaemic control, compared to
high glycaemic index foods, such as white bread. The so-called glycaemic load represents the overall glycaemic effect of the diet and is
calculated by multiplying the glycaemic index by the grammes of carbohydrates.

We identiﬁed eleven relevant randomised controlled trials, lasting 1 to 12 months, involving 402 participants. Metabolic control
(measured by glycated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), a long-term measure of blood glucose levels) decreased by 0.5% HbA1c with low
glycaemic index diet, which is both statistically and clinically signiﬁcant. Hypoglycaemic episodes signiﬁcantly decreased with low
glycaemic index diet compared to high glycaemic index diet. No study reported on mortality, morbidity or costs.

Description of the condition

Description of the intervention

Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder resulting from a defect in
insulin secretion, insulin action, or both. A consequence of this is
chronic hyperglycaemia (that is elevated levels of plasma glucose)
with disturbances of carbohydrate, fat and protein metabolism.
Long-term complications of poorly controlled diabetes mellitus
include retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy, and increased
risk of cardiovascular disease. The prevalence of type 2 diabetes
is increasing and is being diagnosed at increasingly younger ages
(Silink 2002). For a detailed overview of diabetes mellitus, please
see under ’Additional information’ in the Metabolic and En-
docrine Disorders Group section in The Cochrane Library (see
’About’, ’Cochrane Review Groups (CRGs)’). For an explanation

The aim of diabetes management is to normalise blood glucose
levels, since improved blood glucose control is associated with a
reduction in the development of, and progression of, complica-
tions (Stratton 2000). Nutritional factors affect blood glucose lev-
els, however there is currently no universal approach to the op-
timal dietary strategy for diabetes (ADA 2008). Improvement in
glycaemic control achieved through dietary interventions would
lessen the risk of diabetic complications, improve quality of life for
people with diabetes, increase their life expectancy, and minimise,
or even avoid, the necessity for expensive medications and diabetic
health care. Different carbohydrate foods have different effects on
blood glucose and can be ranked by the overall effect on the blood

glucose levels using the glycaemic index (Jenkins 1981). By con-
tributing a gradual supply of glucose to the bloodstream and hence
stimulating lower insulin release, low glycaemic index foods, such
as lentils, beans and oats, may contribute to improved glycaemic
control, compared to high glycaemic index foods, such as white
bread (Jenkins 1981). Low glycaemic index diets may increase in-
sulin sensitivity by minimising ﬂuctuations in blood glucose levels
and reducing the secretion of insulin over the day (Crapo 1977).
The glycaemic load represents the overall glycaemic effect of the
diet and is calculated by multiplying the glycaemic index by the
grammes of carbohydrates (Salmeron 1997).

How the intervention might work

There is controversy over how useful the glycaemic index or gly-
caemic load is in meal planning for people with diabetes. The
authors of a recent Cochrane systematic review concluded that
there were no high-quality data on the efﬁcacy of diet alone for
the treatment of type 2 diabetes (Nield 2008), but low glycaemic
index diets were not one of the diets considered in that review.
However, in another review, it was concluded that low glycaemic
index diets exert a small, but clinically useful effect on medium-
term glycaemic control in diabetes (Brand-Miller 2003).
The American Diabetes Association recommends that “with re-
gard to the glycaemic effects of carbohydrates, the total amount
of carbohydrate in meals or snacks is more important than the
source or type” (ADA 2004). This recommendation was based on
ﬁve studies (Franz 2004) in all of which glycated haemoglobin
levels did not change. However, all these studies had interventions
of six weeks or less and percentage glycated haemoglobin reﬂects
glycaemic control over two to three months (ADA 2004). Short
trials, however, may show differences in the degree of glycation
of serum proteins (mostly albumin), measured by fructosamine
or glycated serum albumin (GSA) assays, since these tests reﬂect
glycaemic control during the preceding one to four weeks (ADA
2004; Goldstein 1995; Winocour 1988). Four of the ﬁve studies
(Franz 2004) reported either fructosamine or GSA results, which
decreased after the low glycaemic index diet, indicating a positive
effect on glycaemic control.
The most recent position statement from the American Diabetes
Association (ADA) maintains that glycaemic control is best at-
tained through monitoring total carbohydrate via carbohydrate
counting, exchange or by experienced-based estimation (ADA
2008). This ADA position statement considers that use of gly-
caemic index or load may provide possibly only a modest sec-
ondary beneﬁt above consideration of total carbohydrate alone
(ADA 2008), even though questions on the glycaemic index were
considered in an ADA statement issued in 2004 (Sheard 2004).

Why it is important to do this review

Our Cochrane systematic review may clarify issues surrounding
the role of low glycaemic index, or low glycaemic load, diets in
the management of diabetes mellitus. Our review will include
all relevant studies with diet interventions lasting four weeks or
longer. If alterations in the glycaemic index or glycaemic load of
the diet can alone improve glycaemic control in diabetes, the use
of low glycaemic index, or low glycaemic load, diets could have
signiﬁcant health and cost beneﬁts for people with diabetes and
the community as a whole.

Criteria for considering studies for this review

Types of studies

Inclusion criteria

Trial Design

We considered all randomised controlled trials that compared a
low glycaemic index, or low glycaemic load, diet with a higher
glycaemic index diet for people with diabetes.

Trial Duration

We included trials with dietary interventions lasting four weeks
or longer. Efﬁcacy was assessed as short term (if follow-up was
less than six months), intermediate (six months to less than 12
months) and long-term (12 months and over).

Exclusion criteria

We excluded studies in which the intervention was only a gen-
eralised recommendation to increase the proportion of low gly-
caemic index foods in the diet, or to reduce the glycaemic load,
without provision of explicit detail; studies in which the interven-
tion was either not directly supervised or well-documented, for
example, through the use of food diaries or the provision of food;
studies in which there was a co-intervention in the experimental
group that was not also applied to the control group.

Types of participants

Participants were males and females of any age who were classiﬁed
as having diabetes mellitus using validated and speciﬁed criteria. To
be consistent with changes in classiﬁcation and diagnostic criteria
of diabetes mellitus through the years, the diagnosis should have
been established using the standard criteria valid at the time of the
beginning of the trial. Ideally, diagnostic criteria should have been
described. If necessary, the authors’ deﬁnition of type 2 diabetes
mellitus was used.

Types of interventions

We included studies that compared a low glycaemic index, or low
glycaemic load, diet with a higher glycaemic index diet or other
diets.

Types of outcome measures

Glycated haemoglobin is the best measure of long-term glycaemic
control, since it represents the average blood glucose levels over
several months (ADA 2004; UKPDS 38 1998; UKPDS33 1998).
Hence, for the review, glycated haemoglobin was deﬁned as the
main outcome measure of glycaemic control for studies where the
intervention lasted over six weeks. Fructosamine or glycated serum
albumin (GSA) levels were used, when provided, as the measure
of glycaemic control for studies where the intervention lasted six
weeks or less, since in these cases, fructosamine or GSA levels
are more reliable indicators of glycaemic control than the degree
of glycation of haemoglobin (ADA 2004; Winocour 1988). The
turnover of human serum albumin is much shorter (half-life of
14 to 20 days) than that of haemoglobin (erythrocyte life span
120 days), so the degree of glycation of serum proteins (mostly
albumin), indicated by fructosamine or GSA, shows the level of
glycaemia better over shorter time periods than does glycation
of haemoglobin (ADA 2004). “Measurements of total glycated
serum protein and GSA correlate well with one another and with
measurements of glycated haemoglobin” (ADA 2004; Goldstein
1995).

peripheral vascular disease, neuropathy, retinopathy,
nephropathy, erectile dysfunction, amputation);

• quality of life (using a validated instrument);
• costs;
• mortality.

Timing of outcome assessment (length of intervention)

Studies were classiﬁed as short term (less than six months), medium
term (six to less than twelve months), or long-term (12 months and
over), according to the timing of the ﬁnal outcome assessments
after the intervention.

Search methods for identiﬁcation of studies

Electronic searches

We searched the following sources for the identiﬁcation of trials:

• The Cochrane Library (Issue 2, 2008);
• MEDLINE (up June 2008);
• EMBASE (up to June 2008);
• CINAHL (up to June 2008).

The included search strategy (see detailed search strategy under
Appendix 1) was used for MEDLINE. This was slightly modiﬁed
for searches of EMBASE, The Cochrane Library and CINAHL. We
placed no language restrictions on either the search or the included
trials.

Searching other resources

We hand searched the reference lists of review articles and included
studies for other potentially eligible studies.

Data collection and analysis

Primary outcomes

Selection of studies

• glycaemic control as measured by glycated haemoglobin,
fructosamine, glycated serum albumin or other test measuring
glycated proteins;

• adverse effects.

Secondary outcomes

• insulin action (fasting plasma insulin, insulin sensitivity,

insulin area under the curve, total insulin released per day,
insulin-to-glucose ratio);

• morbidity (for example diabetes and cardiovascular related

morbidity, like angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, stroke,

Two reviewers independently reviewed the titles, abstract sections
and keywords of every record retrieved from the literature searches
to identify potentially eligible studies. Articles that clearly do not
meet the inclusion criteria were rejected at this initial review. We
obtained the full text of the remaining articles for further exami-
nation. We assessed each study for eligibility for inclusion against
the deﬁned selection criteria and eliminated any trial that did not
fulﬁl this criteria, for example was not a randomised controlled
trial, did not involve people who had diabetes, had no comparator,
included a co-intervention, or in which the trial period was less
than four weeks. The decision to eliminate a trial was based on
agreement by both reviewers. We had planned to calculate inter-

(Cohen 1960; Fleiss 1981), and resolve any differences through
discussion. However, the authors identiﬁed the same abstracts for
further investigation and later for inclusion, so this was not per-
formed. An adapted QUOROM (quality of reporting of meta-
analyses) ﬂow-chart of study selection is attached (Moher 1999)
(Figure 1).

Data extraction and management

Two reviewers independently extracted the data on the study pop-
ulation, intervention and outcomes for each included study, using
a standardised data extraction form.
We extracted the following data:

• general information: published or unpublished, title,

authors, study setting, source, contact address, country, language,
year of publication, duplicate publication, funding source;

• trial characteristics: design, randomisation (and method),

allocation concealment (and method), blinding of outcome
assessors, withdrawals, losses to follow-up.

• intervention and comparator; duration;
• participants: Inclusion criteria, exclusion criteria, number
in intervention and comparison groups, sex, age, health status,

medication status, type of diabetes, diagnostic criteria, similarity
of groups at baseline;

• outcomes: outcomes speciﬁed in the methods, other

outcomes assessed in the study;

• results: For continuous variables, we extracted the number

of participants, and the baseline and post-intervention means
with standard deviations (SD) or standard error of the mean
(SEM) or 95% conﬁdence interval (95% CI) for the intervention
and control groups. We transformed SEM or 95% CI into SD, if
appropriate. Dichotomous outcomes were also recorded.

Any variations in data extraction were resolved by consensus, re-
ferring back to the original data.

Assessment of risk of bias in included studies

Two reviewers independently assessed the methodological quality
of each included trial, based on quality criteria speciﬁed by Schulz
and Jadad (Jadad 1996; Schulz 1995):
(1) Minimisation of selection bias - a) was the randomisation pro-
cedure adequate? b) was the allocation concealment adequate?
(2) Minimisation of attrition bias - a) were withdrawals and drop-
outs completely described? b) was the analysis by intention-to
treat?
(3) Minimisation of detection bias - were the outcome assessors
blind to the intervention? Blinding of either the participant or
the administrator of the intervention is generally not possible in
dietary intervention studies, and it is often not feasible to have
an assessor who has had no part in the trial, hence blinding was
not assessed as a quality criterion. However, blinding of outcome
assessors was recorded.
As there were insufﬁcient trials, sensitivity analyses on the quality
of the included trials (A - low risk of bias: all quality criteria met;
B - moderate risk of bias: one or more of the quality criteria only
partially met; C - high risk of bias: one or more quality criteria
not met) were not performed (Cochrane Handbook for Systematic
Reviews of Interventions) (Higgins 2005).
We had planned to calculate the level of inter-rater agreement on
quality assessment using the kappa statistic (Cohen 1960; Fleiss
1981), however, as there was no variation, this was not performed.

Assessment of heterogeneity

We tested for heterogeneity between trial results using the standard
2 test to examine whether any variation in study results could be
χ
due to the variation expected by chance alone, with signiﬁcance
set at α = 0.1. Quantiﬁcation of the effect of heterogeneity was
assessed by means of I2, ranging from 0% to 100% including
its 95% conﬁdence interval (Higgins 2002). I2 demonstrates the
percentage of total variation across studies due to heterogeneity
and was used to judge the consistency of evidence. I2 values of 50%
and more indicate a substantial level of heterogeneity (Higgins
2003). If heterogeneity had been found, we planned to explore it
using subgroup and sensitivity analyses.
Where summarising the results seemed appropriate (sufﬁciently
similar studies of similar quality), we used a random-effects model
which assumes the effect size varies across studies. We used inten-
tion-to-treat analysis where possible.

Assessment of reporting biases

Publication bias was explored through assessment of funnel plot
asymmetry (Cooper 1994; Tang 2000).

Data synthesis

sults were sufﬁciently homogeneous and of sufﬁcient quality. For
dichotomous outcomes, we planned to express the effect size in
terms of relative risk with 95% conﬁdence interval (CI), but no
dichotomous outcomes were included in this review.
For continuous outcomes, we calculated weighted mean differ-
ences. We extracted the baseline and post-intervention means with
standard deviations (SD) (or standard error of the mean (SEM)
or 95% conﬁdence interval (CI)) for the intervention and control
groups, transforming any SEM or 95% CI into SD where ap-
propriate. For absolute changes in outcome between baseline and
post-intervention for the control and intervention groups, mean
difference was calculated, if required, by subtracting the control
absolute change from the intervention absolute change. The esti-
mate of variance for each of these changes equals Vpre + Vpost -
2r(SEpre x SEpost), where Vpre and SEpre are the variance and
standard error of the mean baseline value; Vpost and SEpost are the
variance and standard error of the mean post-intervention value;
and r is the correlation between baseline and post-intervention
values. The variance of the total change is then the sum of the
variance of the change in the intervention group and the variance
of the change in the control group. If the value of r was not given,
we assumed that r equalled 0.5.
When post-intervention measures of dispersion were not given
(for example if the results were presented as percentage change
from baseline), the baseline measures of dispersion were also used
as the post-intervention values. This is a conservative approach,
since variation at baseline should be larger than that at post-in-
tervention, but this approach was only taken when pre- and post-
measures of dispersion for the same outcome were similar to each
other in other trials. If the results were given on different scales,
we used standardised mean differences. When data were only pre-
sented graphically, an estimate of the mean and SD was obtained
from the graph.
Drop-outs, losses to follow-up and withdrawn study participants
were investigated. Where there were two papers reporting on the
same study, we maximised the yield of information by simultane-
ous evaluation of all available data, with the original publication
given priority.

Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity

Subgroup analysis was planned where a primary outcome parame-
ter was statistically signiﬁcantly different between dietary groups.
The following subgroup analyses were planned:

• age, less than or equal to 18 years, 19 to 40 years, 41 to 65

years, more than 65 years;

• duration of trial intervention: short term (less than or equal
to three months), medium term (three to six months), long term
(more than six months);

All data were initially analysed with a ﬁxed effect model. We sum-
marized the data statistically, including meta-analysis of trial re-
sults where appropriate, that is if the data were available and re-

No authors were successfully contacted for further information or

Sensitivity analysis

We had planned to perform sensitivity analyses to explore the
inﬂuence of the following factors on effect size, by repeating the
analysis:

• excluding unpublished studies;
• taking study quality, as speciﬁed above, into account;
• excluding any long or large studies to determine their

inﬂuence on the results;

• excluding studies using the following ﬁlters: diagnostic
criteria, language of publication, source of funding (industry
versus other), country.

However, there were insufﬁcient studies to perform these analyses.

Assessment of inter-rater agreement

Both authors reviewed the studies, and were in agreement on those
to be fully assessed. From these, studies eligible for inclusion in
the review were identiﬁed. Both authors agreed on the ﬁnal papers
chosen for assessment and on the quality assessment of the studies.

Description of studies

Results of the search

From the initial search, 2899 records were identiﬁed. From the ab-
stracts of these, we identiﬁed 32 papers for examination of the full
text. The other papers were excluded on the basis of their abstract
because they did not ﬁt the criteria for the review. Main reasons
for exclusion were: papers were reviews, not relevant, duplicates,
some or all of the participants did not have diagnosed diabetes,
study had no control group or no randomisation, studies did not
compare similar groups, there was a co-intervention or the inter-
vention was less than four weeks.
Eleven studies met the inclusion criteria (Brand 1991; Collier
1988; Fontvieille 1992; Frost 1994; Giacco 2000; Gilbertson
2001; Jimenez-Cruz 2003; Komindr 2001; Luscombe 1999;
Rizkalla 2004; Wolever 1992). Six reported percentage gly-
cated haemoglobin (Brand 1991; Giacco 2000; Gilbertson 2001;
Komindr 2001; Jimenez-Cruz 2003; Rizkalla 2004), four reported
fructosamine (Fontvieille 1992; Frost 1994; Luscombe 1999;
Wolever 1992) and one reported glycosylated albumin (Collier
1988). One study reported both percentage glycated haemoglobin
and fructosamine, but as the intervention was less than six weeks,
only the fructosamine results were included (Fontvieille 1992).
For an adapted QUOROM (quality of reporting of meta-analyses)
ﬂow-chart of study selection see Figure 1.

Study types

All eleven studies identiﬁed for the review were randomised
controlled trials (Brand 1991; Collier 1988; Fontvieille 1992;
Frost 1994; Giacco 2000; Gilbertson 2001; Jimenez-Cruz 2003;
Luscombe 1999; Komindr 2001; Rizkalla 2004; Wolever 1992).
They were conducted in Australia (Brand 1991; Gilbertson 2001;
Luscombe 1999), Canada (Wolever 1992), France (Fontvieille
1992; Rizkalla 2004), Italy (Giacco 2000) Mexico (Jimenez-Cruz
2003) and UK (Frost 1994). The duration ranged from four weeks
(Komindr 2001; Luscombe 1999; Rizkalla 2004 ) to 52 weeks
(Gilbertson 2001). The maximum length of follow up was 12
months from the start of the intervention (Gilbertson 2001).

Participants

The included studies involved a total of 402 participants. The
number of participants ranged from 104 participants in a paral-
lel trial (Gilbertson 2001) to six participants in a crossover trial
(Wolever 1992). The mean age ranged from 10 (SD 2) years
(Gilbertson 2001) to 63 (SD 4) years (Wolever 1992) and more
males than females participated. There was a total of 247 partici-
pants in the six studies reporting percentage glycated haemoglobin
included in the percentage glycated haemoglobin meta-analysis
(Brand 1991; Giacco 2000; Gilbertson 2001; Jimenez-Cruz 2003;
Komindr 2001; Rizkalla 2004) and a total of 141 participants
in the four studies reporting fructosamine included in the fruc-
tosamine meta-analysis (Fontvieille 1992; Frost 1994; Luscombe
1999; Wolever 1992). There were 14 participants in the trial re-
porting results as glycosylated albumin (Collier 1988). 209 of these
participants received the low glycaemic index or load diet inter-
vention. Two studies involved children (Collier 1988; Gilbertson
2001).

Interventions

Ten studies compared a low glycaemic index diet with a higher
glycaemic index diet (Brand 1991; Collier 1988; Fontvieille 1992;
Frost 1994; Giacco 2000; Jimenez-Cruz 2003; Komindr 2001;
Luscombe 1999; Rizkalla 2004; Wolever 1992). One study com-
pared the low-GI diet to a diet using measured carbohydrate ex-
changes (Gilbertson 2001).

Duration of studies

The low glycaemic index dietary interventions ranged from four
weeks duration (Komindr 2001; Luscombe 1999; Rizkalla 2004)
to 12 months (Gilbertson 2001).

Morbidity (diabetes and cardiovascular related morbidity,
like angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, stroke, peripheral
vascular disease, neuropathy, retinopathy, nephropathy,
erectile dysfunction, amputation)

No trial included morbidity as outcome.

Quality of life (using a validated instrument)

One trial included quality of life as an outcome (Gilbertson 2001).

Outcomes

No trial included costs as an outcome

Original data can be found in Appendix 3 and Appendix 4.

Costs

Mortality

No trial included mortality as an outcome.

Glycaemic control

Glycated haemoglobin: Seven of the included trials reported per-
centage glycated haemoglobin ( Brand 1991; Fontvieille 1992;
Giacco 2000; Gilbertson 2001; Jimenez-Cruz 2003; Komindr
2001; Rizkalla 2004). One of these trials reported both percentage
glycated haemoglobin and fructosamine results, hence as this trial
had a duration of only ﬁve weeks, as per the protocol only the value
for fructosamine was included in the meta-analysis (Fontvieille
1992).

but after the entire papers had been perused and the reasons for

studies.

Risk of bias in included studies

For details see Appendix 2.

Adverse events

Two trials reported adverse events or included the incidence
of hypo- and hyperglycaemia in the outcomes (Giacco 2000;
Gilbertson 2001).

Allocation

While all included trials were described as randomised, only one
included trial reported the method of randomisation, through the
use of random number tables ( Frost 1994).

Secondary outcomes

Incomplete outcome data

Insulin action (fasting plasma insulin, insulin sensitivity,
insulin area under the curve, total insulin released/day,
insulin-to-glucose ratio)

Five studies included parameters related to insulin action as an out-
come (Fontvieille 1992; Giacco 2000; Gilbertson 2001; Luscombe
1999; Rizkalla 2004).

Most studies described losses to follow-up or dropouts, if any oc-
curred in the study. There were no dropouts in six trials (Brand
1991; Collier 1988; Fontvieille 1992; Komindr 2001; Rizkalla
2004; Wolever 1992). Dropouts were encountered in the other ﬁve
trials (Frost 1994; Giacco 2000; Gilbertson 2001; Jimenez-Cruz
2003; Luscombe 1999) and reasons for the dropouts were de-
scribed in four of these trials (Frost 1994; Gilbertson 2001;
Jimenez-Cruz 2003; Luscombe 1999). One study, with nine drop-
outs, did not give reasons (Giacco 2000).

Other potential sources of bias

No trial included in the review reported any signiﬁcant differences
between groups in the main characteristics of participants at base-
line.

Effects of interventions

Glycaemic index of the intervention and control
group diets

The glycaemic index (GI) of the low-GI diet in the Brand 1991
study was 15% lower than that of the high-GI diet (77 ± 3 SE
versus 91 ± 3, P < 0.01). The mean GI for the low-GI diet was 12
units lower than the control high-GI diet in the Collier 1988 study
(68 ± 3 SE versus 82 ± 1 units P < 0.005), and this change was
achieved by exchanging approximately 50% of the carbohydrates
coming from high-GI foods for low-GI foods. In the Fontvieille
1992 study, 38 ± 5% SD was the GI for the low-GI diet, while the
GI for the high-GI diet was 64 ± 2%, P < 0.001. The GI of the
low-GI diet in the Frost 1994 study was 77 ± 1% SEM, while the
GI of the high-GI diet was 82 ± 1%, P < 0.01. The average GI of
the two diets was also different in the Giacco 2000 study, where the
intervention diet had a GI of 70% and the control diet had a GI
of 90%. In the Gilbertson 2001 study, in which the participants
were all children with type 1 diabetes (n = 104) the low-GI diet,
which was designed to be ﬂexible, was compared to a measured
carbohydrate exchange diet. Both the GI and the glycaemic load
(GL) of the low-GI diet were signiﬁcantly lower the the high-
GI diet for the Jimenez-Cruz 2003 study (P = 0.0001). In the
Komindr 2001 study, the GI of the low-GI diet versus the high-
GI diet was approximately 70 versus 100 GI units. The GI of the
low-GI diet was 20 units lower than that of the high-GI diet in
the Luscombe 1999 study (43 GI units versus 63 GI units). The
low-GI diet had a GI of 58 compared with 86 for the high-GI diet
in the Wolever 1992 study.

Primary outcomes

Glycaemic control

Pooled data from the six studies reporting glycated haemoglobin
A1c (HbA1c) with participants whose glycated haemoglobin was
not yet optimised (Brand 1991; Giacco 2000; Gilbertson 2001;
Jimenez-Cruz 2003; Komindr 2001; Rizkalla 2004) showed that
there was a signiﬁcant decrease in HbA1c levels, indicating im-
proved glycaemic control (WMD -0.5 % HbA1c, 95% CI -0.8 to
-0.2, P = 0.001). When parallel and cross-over trials were analysed
separately, pooled effect estimates remained stable: In the HbA1c
parallel group of trials (Giacco 2000 and Gilbertson 2001) the
WMD was -0.5% with a 95% CI of - 0.9 to -0.1, P = 0.02; and in

the cross-over group of trials the WMD was -0.5% with a 95%CI
of -1.0 to -0.1, P = 0.03
Considering the studies individually, in the study comparing the
low glycaemic index diet with the carbohydrate exchange diet,
by 12 months the mean difference in HbA1c levels between the
groups was not signiﬁcant (P = 0.05), however twice as many
participants in the low GI group (45%) attained acceptable HbA1c
levels compared with only 22% of participants in the carbohydrate
exchange group (P = 0.02 after adjustment for baseline values)
(Gilbertson 2001).
Percentage HbA1c was also signiﬁcantly lower after the low-GI
diet compared to after the high-GI diet in the Jimenez-Cruz 2003
study (P < 0.02), in the Giacco 2000 study (P < 0.05), in the
Brand 1991 study (P < 0.05) and in the Rizkalla 2004 study (P
< 0.05). In the Rizkalla 2004 study, the reduction in the change
in HbA1c after the low-GI diet was also signiﬁcantly more than
after the high-GI diet (P < 0.01).
One study which had a 12 week intervention reported the main
outcome as fructosamine (Frost 1994). The three studies with
an intervention duration of 4 to 6 weeks also reported results as
fructosamine (Fontvieille 1992; Luscombe 1999; Wolever 1992),
WMD -0.20 mmol/L (95% CI -0.46 to 0.07, P = 0.14).
Considering these studies individually, in the Fontvieille 1992
study, the reduction in fructosamine with the low-GI diet was
signiﬁcant compared to the high-GI diet (3.9 ± 0.9 versus 3.4
± 0.4, mmol/L, P < 0.05). In the parallel Frost 1994 study, the
within-group change in fructosamine levels, which decreased in
the low-GI diet group but not in the high-GI diet group, was
also signiﬁcant (P < 0.05). The Wolever 1992 study reported that
serum fructosamine fell signiﬁcantly after the low-GI diet, with
no change after the high-GI diet (P < 0.05).

Glycosylated albumin levels decreased signiﬁcantly in the low gly-
caemic index intervention, but not in the high glycaemic inter-
vention in the one study reporting this outcome (low glycaemic
index diet 13.2 ± 1.5 % to 10.7 ± 2.2 %, P < 0.05; high glycaemic
index diet 13.1 ± 2.3 % to 14.6 ± 1.9 %, not signiﬁcant) (Collier
1988).

Adverse effects

Two trials reported on hypo- or hyperglycaemic events, but did
not give further infomation on whether they were mild/moderate
or severe (Giacco 2000; Gilbertson 2001). In the meta-analysis for
episodes of hypoglycaemia, there was heterogeneity (I2 = 50.8%)
and so the results for the two studies are reported separately: In
one study, where the control diet was a higher GI diet, episodes
of hypoglycaemia were signiﬁcantly fewer with the low-GI diet
compared to the control diet (mean difference -0.8 episodes per
patient per month, P < 0.01) (Giacco 2000). In the second study,
where the control diet was a measured carbohydrate exchange diet
in children with type 1 diabetes, the proportion of participants

reporting more than 15 episodes of hyperglycaemia per month
was signiﬁcantly lower for the low-GI diet group compared to
the measured carbohydrate exchange group, (35% versus 66%,
P = 0.006 after adjustment for baseline values) at 12 months (
Gilbertson 2001).

Secondary outcomes

Insulin action

Five included studies reported on parameters related to insulin ac-
tion (Fontvieille 1992; Giacco 2000; Gilbertson 2001; Luscombe
1999; Rizkalla 2004).
Whole body peripheral insulin sensitivity, measured by eugly-
caemic-hyperinsulinaemic clamp, was signiﬁcantly higher after the
low-GI diet than after the high-GI diet (glucose disposal: 7.0 ± 1.3
versus 4.8 ± 0.9 mg glucose/kg/min, P < 0.001)(Rizkalla 2004).
Another study reported that no signiﬁcant differences were found
in insulin or drug requirements, or in insulin binding to erythro-
cytes (Fontvieille 1992). In the two studies reporting insulin dose,
both found no signiﬁcant differences (Giacco 2000; Gilbertson
2001). There were also no signiﬁcant differences reported in
plasma insulin levels between groups (Luscombe 1999).

Morbidity

No study reported on morbidity.

Quality of life (using a validated instrument)

One trial, in children, reported on quality of life and found that
it was signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced by the type of diet (Gilbertson
2001), although validation measures for the questionnaire were
not reported. In this trial, twice as many parents in the low-GI
group stated that their child had no difﬁculties in selecting their
own meals at the 12-month time point (51% versus 24%, P =
0.01). Almost twice as many parents from the low-GI group also
reported that diabetes never limited the type of family activities
pursued (53% versus 27%, P = 0.02).

Costs

No study reported on costs.

Mortality

No study reported on mortality.

Heterogeneity

There was heterogeneity in the adverse events results for episodes
of hypoglycaemia. In the meta-analysis for episodes of hypogly-
caemia, as there was heterogeneity (I2 = 50.8%), the results for the
two studies have been reported separately. In one study, where the
control diet was a higher GI diet, episodes of hypoglycaemia were
signiﬁcantly fewer with the low-GI diet compared to the control
diet (WMD -0.8 episodes, 95% CI -1.3 to -0.3, P < 0.01) (Giacco
2000). In the second study, the control diet was a measured carbo-
hydrate exchange diet in children with type 1 diabetes and there
was no difference reported in hypoglycaemic episodes (Gilbertson
2001).

Subgroup analysis

Not performed due to the small number of included studies.

Sensitivity analysis

The results were substantially unaffected by omitting individual
studies from the analysis.

Assessment of publication bias

There were too few studies for detailed analysis of the funnel plot.

Follow-up

One study reported results at 12 month follow-up from the com-
mencement of the study, reporting that rates of excessive hyper-
glycaemia (>15 episodes per month) were signiﬁcantly lower in
the low-GI group (35 versus 66%, P = 0.006) (Gilbertson 2001).

Summary of main results

This review indicates that glycaemic control in people with dia-
betes improved signiﬁcantly with a low glycaemic index diet, com-
pared to those on higher glycaemic index diets or measured car-
bohydrate exchange diets. The decrease of 0.5% glycated haemo-
globin A1c (HbA1c) is clinically signiﬁcant and is similar to de-
creases achieved through medications for newly diagnosed type 2
diabetes ( Holman 1999; UK PDSG 1995). Improvements of this
size have been associated with a signiﬁcant reduction in the risk of
microvascular complications (Stratton 2000). The UK Prospec-
tive Diabetes Study Group (UKPDSG) found that each 1% re-
duction in glycated haemoglobin was associated with a reduction
in risk of 21% (95% conﬁdence interval (CI) 17% to 24%, P <

0.0001) for any end point related to diabetes and a reduction in
risk of 37% (95% CI 33% to 41%, P < 0.0001) for microvascular
complications and that any reduction in glycated haemoglobin is
likely to reduce the risk of complications (Stratton 2000).
Of additional clinical signiﬁcance, improved glycaemic control
was also associated with a decrease in adverse outcomes, namely
hypoglycaemic episodes. In the two trials that reported this out-
come, improved glycated haemoglobin was associated with a re-
duction in hypoglycaemic events with the low-GI diet compared
to a high-GI diet in one trial (Giacco 2000), and in the other
trial, the proportion of participants reporting more than 15 hy-
perglycaemic episodes per month was lower for the low-GI diet
compared to a measured carbohydrate exchange diet (Gilbertson
2001).
Considering each of the studies individually, the improvement in
glycaemic control in people on low-GI diets versus other diets
reached statistical signiﬁcance in nine of the individual included
studies: ﬁve which were reporting HbA1c (Brand 1991; Giacco
2000; Gilbertson 2001; Jimenez-Cruz 2003; Rizkalla 2004), three
reporting fructosamine (Fontvieille 1992; Frost 1994; Wolever
1992) and one reporting per cent glycosylated albumin (Collier
1988). The meta-analysis conﬁrmed these results.

Of the eleven studies included in this review, three studies had
participants with type 1 diabetes (Collier 1988, Giacco 2000;
Gilbertson 2001), seven with type 2 diabetes (Brand 1991;
Frost 1994; Jimenez-Cruz 2003; Komindr 2001; Rizkalla 2004;
Wolever 1992) and one study had participants with either type 1
or type 2 (Fontvieille 1992). Two studies involved children, all of
whom had type 1 diabetes (Collier 1988; Gilbertson 2001).
One excluded study reported that there was a greater reduction
in the change in percentage glycated haemoglobin after the low-
GI diet compared to that after the high-GI diet (-0.3% HbA1c)
(Heilbronn 2002). This study was excluded from this review be-
cause participants were of unknown diabetic status at the start
of the intervention (diabetic or improved diabetic), only having
been diagnosed as having type 2 diabetes during some time in the
previous ten years.
In the Wolever 2008 study, participants commenced the study
with already optimised HbA1c levels (6.2 ± 1% HbA1c) and hence
this study was also excluded, since the effect of the diets on HbA1c
was our primary outcome. This study found, however, that there
were sustained reductions in both postprandial glucose and C-
reactive protein on the low-GI diet, also indicating that it could
be beneﬁcial in the ongoing management of type 2 diabetes.
In another excluded study, in which medications were adjusted
as necessary, signiﬁcantly less diabetic medication was required in
people on the low glycaemic index diet, compared to the ADA
diet, to achieve equivalent control of HbA1c levels (Ma 2008).
Insulin sensitivity was affected by the glycaemic index of the diet,
with a signiﬁcant increase in the whole body peripheral insulin
sensitivity, measured via euglycaemic-hyperinsulinaemic clamp af-

ter the low-GI diet compared to the high-GI diet (Rizkalla 2004).
All studies in the review compared the low glycaemic index diet
with a high glycaemic index diet, except for one study in which
the comparison diet was a measured carbohydrate exchange diet
(Gilbertson 2001). In this study comparing the low-GI diet to
a restricted carbohydrate exchange diet, involving children with
type 1 diabetes (Gilbertson 2001), twice as many participants in
the low-GI group reached acceptable HbA1c levels at 12 months
without any increase in the rate of hypoglycaemic occurrences,
compared to the carbohydrate exchange group. Hence, even when
compared to the restricted carbohydrate exchange diet, the low
glycaemic index diet showed greater improvement in glycaemic
control.

Overall completeness and applicability of
evidence

This review suggests that a low-GI diet is beneﬁcial for improv-
ing glycaemic control in people with diabetes, and that a low-GI
diet is associated with a decrease in the number of hypoglycaemic
episodes. Participants in the included trials were both adults and
children with diabetes, suggesting that the results would be rele-
vant to a broad spectrum of age groups in other similar commu-
nities. Inclusion criteria for studies were either type 1 or type 2 di-
abetes, or both, and hence the results of the review have relevance
to both types of diabetes. None of the trials occurred in developing
countries.

Potential biases in the review process

Eleven relevant studies were identiﬁed, all of which were ran-
domised controlled trials. Some methodological limitations were
present such as failure to conceal allocation and lack of reporting
on blinding of outcome assessors.

Implications for practice

The studies included in this systematic review were all randomised
controlled trials, and all had interventions of at least four weeks or
longer. The longest trial was 12 months. This review provides data
that low glycaemic index diets can signiﬁcantly improve diabetic
control in less than optimally controlled people with diabetes by
lowering percentage glycated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels by
0.5%. This is clinically signiﬁcant and comparable to decreases
achieved through medications for newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes
(Holman 1999; UK PDSG 1995). The UK Prospective Diabetes
Study Group found that 1% reduction in glycated haemoglobin

was associated with reductions in risk of 21% for any end point
related to diabetes and a reduction in risk of 37% for microvas-
cular complications and that any reduction in glycated haemoglo-
bin is likely to reduce the risk of complications (Stratton 2000).
Importantly, reduction in glycated haemoglobin with the low-GI
diet was associated with decreased risk of hypoglycaemic episodes.
When compared with a high-GI diet, the low-GI diet reduced
hypoglycaemic events signiﬁcantly (Giacco 2000). Similarly, the
proportion of participants reporting more than 15 hyperglycaemic
episodes per month was signiﬁcantly lower for the low-GI diet
compared to the measured carbohydrate exchange diet (Gilbertson
2001).

Whole body peripheral insulin sensitivity, measured via eugly-
caemic-hyperinsulinaemic clamp, was also signiﬁcantly affected by
the glycaemic index of the diet, signiﬁcantly increasing in the low-
GI group compared to the high-GI group (Rizkalla 2004). The
improvement may beneﬁt the patient with diabetes by lessening
or even avoiding the requirement for medication.

Hence, lowering the glycaemic index of foods in the diet appears to
be an effective method of improving glycaemic control in diabetes
without compromising the number of hypoglycaemic episodes.

Implications for research

While one study provided follow-up data at 12 months after the

start of the intervention, it would be useful if further long-range
studies could be performed, including quality of life outcomes
with validated instruments to determine the acceptability of in-
corporating a low-GI diet in a person’s lifestyle, as well as mea-
surement of long-term glycaemic control. There are indications
that the improvement can be maintained, as an excluded study
reported that at 12 months, there was no signiﬁcant change in
HbA1c levels which had already been optimised before the com-
mencement of the study (Wolever 2008). There were two studies
in children, all of whom had type 1 diabetes, and further longer
range studies with children would be useful to conﬁrm the impact
of low glycaemic index diets on long-term glycaemic control, ad-
verse events and quality of life.

Description of the intervention, 20 March 2009

Summary

The intervention isn’t clearly described in a way that would allow it to be reproduced (or at least I couldn’t ﬁnd this - it isn’t in the
“Description of the intervention”). As it doesn’t deﬁne what constitutes low GI or low glycaemic load, a reader with diabetes might not
know what the implications of this review’s ﬁndings are for improving his or her diet.

Reply

As the glycaemic index (GI) represents the degree that a carbohydrate can raise the blood glucose, it is necessary to test a food in people
to determine its GI, rather than predict the GI through its structure. The GI of a food can be affected by several factors such as the
cooking method used for preparation, the form of the food, the type of starch it contains, how much ﬁbre it contains and also how
much and what type of sugar is present in the food. Processing increases the gelatinised starch content and so can raise the GI of the
food. Grains and legumes that have ﬁbrous husks, as well as foods containing soluble ﬁbre, such as oatmeal and apples tend to have a
lower GI.
The low GI diet is a diet generally high in carbohydrate foods, but with legumes, whole grains (eg oats, barley, rye), and low GI versions
of bread, rice, pasta, fruit and vegetables forming the basis. A low GI diet can be achieved by substituting the high GI foods in the diet
with lower GI alternatives. Hence, consuming semolina, muesli or porridge instead of processed cereals; basmati rice, instead of short
grain rice; sweet potato instead of white potato; whole grain, rye or sourdough bread instead of white bread can signiﬁcantly lower the
GI of the diet. Pasta is also a low GI option. If the lower GI alternative food is eaten for these carbohydrate rich foods, then a low
GI diet can include whatever types of vegetables and meat that are required to provide a balanced healthy diet, as these contain, by
comparison, little carbohydrate.
These changes from higher to lower GI foods can be gradually incorporated into the eating pattern, so that they become part of the
normal diet and the GI of the overall diet signiﬁcantly lowers.

Abstract

Background:The consumption of dairy products may influence the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), but inconsistent
findings have been reported. Moreover, large variation in the types of dairy intake has not yet been fully explored.

MethodsandResults: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to clarify the dose–response association of
dairy products intake and T2DM risk. We searched PubMed, EMBASE and Scopus for studies of dairy products intake and
T2DM risk published up to the end of October 2012. Random-effects models were used to estimate summary relative risk
(RR) statistics. Dose-response relations were evaluated using data from different dairy products in each study. We included
14 articles of cohort studies that reported RR estimates and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) of T2DM with dairy products
intake. We found an inverse linear association of consumption of total dairy products (13 studies), low-fat dairy products (8
studies), cheese (7 studies) and yogurt (7 studies) and risk of T2DM. The pooled RRs were 0.94 (95% CI 0.91–0.97) and 0.88
(0.84–0.93) for 200 g/day total and low-fat dairy consumption, respectively. The pooled RRs were 0.80 (0.69–0.93) and 0.91
(0.82–1.00) for 30 g/d cheese and 50 g/d yogurt consumption, respectively. We also found a nonlinear association of total
and low-fat dairy intake and T2DM risk, and the inverse association appeared to be strongest within 200 g/d intake.

Conclusion:A modest increase in daily intake of dairy products such as low fat dairy, cheese and yogurt may contribute to
the prevention of T2DM, which needs confirmation in randomized controlled trials.

Introduction

The prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a growing
public-health burden worldwide, particularly in developing
countries. The prevalence of T2DM is estimated to reach
552 million worldwide by 2030 [1]. T2DM may cause substantial
morbidity and mortality and is associated with enormous
economic, health, and societal costs [2,3]. Moreover, as compared
with unaffected people, those with T2DM are at increased risk of
other chronic illnesses, including cardiovascular disease; T2DM
more than doubles the risk of a heart attack or stroke [4,5].
Therefore, the identification of modifiable risk factors for primary
prevention of T2DM is of considerable public health importance.
T2DM has genetic components but is also directly influenced by
modifiable lifestyle factors, including dietary behaviors [6]. Dairy
consumption might affect T2DM. Experimental studies indicated
that dairy protein, such as whey protein, has insulinotropic and
glucose-lowering properties [7].The Multi-Ethnic Study Athero-
sclerosis [8] and Cardiovascular Health study [9] suggested that
fatty acids in dairy might be responsible for lower risk of T2DM.

Epidemiological studies of dairy products and T2DM risk have
given mixed results [10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23].
Some cohort studies have reported inverse associations of intake of
total and low-fat dairy products, milk and/or yogurt and T2DM
risk, but other studies found no association [10,11,19,20,23]. One
meta-analysis of 7 studies reported a significant inverse association
of dairy intake and risk of T2DM [24]. However, the large
variation in types of dairy consumed has not been fully explored.
Furthermore, the dose–response relationship needs to be clarified
as well as any gender or geographic differences in the T2DM risk.
In addition, possible confounding by other lifestyle factors needs to
be explored to firmly establish the potential preventive role of
dairy products in T2DM.

We conducted a meta-analysis of population-based cohort
studies to investigate dose–response associations of consumption of

Methods

Data Sources and Search Strategy

We followed standard criteria for conducting and reporting
meta-analyses of observational studies (MOOSE). Two authors
(DG and NN) independently did a literature search MEDLINE via
PubMed (published from 1966 to March 2013), EMBASE
(published from 1980 to March 2013), and Scopus (www.scopus.
com) with no restriction on language. To identify studies of milk or
dairy product intake and T2DM risk, we used both the medical
subject heading (MeSH) terms (‘‘Diabetes Mellitus’’ AND (milk
OR dairy)) and searched the text using the terms (‘diabetes’/exp
OR diabetes’) AND (‘dairy’/exp OR dairy OR ‘milk’/exp OR
milk). We also searched the reference lists of all studies retrieved
and published systematic reviews and meta-analysis.

Study Selection

All abstracts retrieved were examined independently by 2
investigators (DG and NN) who then retrieved the full text of
potential articles. Disagreements were resolved by consensus, and
if necessary, with a third author (CW). We included prospective
cohort studies and case-cohort studies assessing the association of
consumption of total dairy products or specific types of dairy
products and T2DM. To be included in the analyses, articles
needed to contain estimates of the relative risk (RR) (such as odds
ratios [ORs], hazard ratios [HRs] or risk ratios) with 95%
confidence intervals (95% CIs). We excluded animal studies,
clinical trials, cross sectional studies, case-control studies, and
studies that examined other associations. For the dose–response
analysis, a quantitative measure of intake had to be provided. If
the article lacked data, we attempted to contact the author.

Data Extraction and Quality Assessment

We extracted the following data from each study: country where
the study was conducted, follow-up period, sample size, gender,
age, number of cases, dietary assessment method (type, number of
food items and whether the food intake had been validated), type
of dairy product (e.g., total dairy, milk, cheese), quantity of intake,
HRs, RR values, and ORs and 95% CIs for dairy product intake
and, when available, the number of cases and participants or
person-years for each category of dairy product consumption. Two
authors
independently performed the data
extraction. Any disagreements were resolved by discussion.

(YL and ZM)

Two independent reviewers (DG and NN) evaluated the quality
of the selected studies by using a modified scoring system that was
based on a recently used system (designed with reference to
QUATSO [25], MOOSE [26], and STROBE [27]) that allowed
for a total score of 0 to 6 points (6 indicating highest quality) [28].
The system allocates one point each for 1) any justification given
for the cohort; 2) appropriate inclusion and exclusion criteria used;
3) outcome (diagnosis of T2DM not solely based on self-reporting);
4)
intervention (participants’ usual dairy consumption assessed
with a validated tool); 5) statistical analysis (adjustments made for
age, sex, body mass index, and family history of T2DM, total
energy intake and physical activity, these being proven risk factors
for type 2 diabetes); and 6) any other adjustments performed (such
as glycemic load and dietary factors).

Statistical analysis

HRs and RRs were assumed to be approximately the same
measure of relative risk. For articles reporting ORs, we estimated
the RRs from the ORs using a previously published correction
method [29]. To take into account heterogeneity between studies,
we used a random-effects models to calculate summary RRs and

Dairy Products and Diabetes

95% CIs for the highest versus lowest level of dairy product intake
and for the dose–response analysis. The natural logarithm of the
RR from each study was weighted by the inverse of its variance
and pooled across studies. A two-tailed P,0.05 was considered
statistically significant. Articles that reported findings for men and
women separately were considered 2 studies when the observed
items were combined.

For the dose–response analysis, we used GLST command in
Stata software as
the method proposed by Greenland and
Longnecker [30] and Orsini et al. [31] to compute study-specific
slopes (linear trends) and 95% CIs from the natural logs of the RRs
and 95% CIs across categories of dairy product intake.

For each study, the median or mean level of dairy product
intake for each category was assigned to each corresponding RR.
When the median or mean intake per category was not provided,
we assigned the midpoint of upper and lower boundaries in each
category as the average intake. If the highest or the lowest category
was open-ended, we assumed that the open-ended interval length
had the same length as the adjacent interval. If the intake was
reported in densities (i.e., per 1000 kcal), we recalculated the
reported intake as absolute intake using the mean or median
energy intake reported in the article [14]. When studies reported
the intake in servings and times per day or week, we converted the

intake to grams of intake per day using standard units of 244 g (or
244 ml) for milk, 43 g for cheese (2 slices) and 177 g for total dairy
products from the serving sizes reported in the US Department of
Agriculture Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies [32]. Pooled
estimates were expressed in rounded numbers that approximated a
normal portion size and fitted within the range of dairy intake of
all studies (i.e., 200 g for milk and total, low-fat, and full-fat dairy;
50 g for yogurt; and 30 g for cheese).

To examine a potential nonlinear association between dairy
products intake and T2DM risk, we performed a 2-stage, random-
effects, dose-response meta-analysis, as recently summarized [33].
In the first stage, we constructed study-specific restricted cubic
spline models, with 4 knots at fixed percentiles (5%, 35%, 65%,
95%) of the exposure distribution by using generalized least-
squares regression. In the second stage, we combined the 2
regression coefficients and the variance/covariance matrix that
had been estimated within each study, using the restricted
maximum likelihood method in a multivariate random-effects
meta-analysis. The pooled relative risks for specific exposure
values were then estimated. A P value for nonlinearity was
calculated by testing the null hypothesis that the coefficient of the
second spline was equal to zero.

Heterogeneity among studies was assessed by I2, the amount of
total variation explained by the between-study variation, and the
Q test. We conducted subgroup and random effects univariate and
multivariate meta-regression to investigate potential sources of
heterogeneity we performed for the primary outcomes. Publication
bias was assessed with funnel plots, Begg’s test and Egger’s test.
Stata v12.0 (Stata Corp, College Station, TX) was used for all the
statistical analysis.

We included 15 prospective cohort studies and 1 case–cohort
study
studies
[12,13,14,15,16,18] were performed in the United States, 6 in
Europe [11,19,21,23,34,35], 2 in Asia [17,22] and 2 in Australia
[10,20]. The articles were published between 2005 and 2013 and
included 526,998 subjects
(including 29,789 T2DM cases).
Characteristics of included studies are in Table 1. Figures 2 show
assessments by risk of bias. The studies were generally of moderate
quality. More than 75% of the studies met 4 of the quality items as
reported and 8 studies met all requirements. Interrater reliability
for assessing quality items was good (k = 0.86, P,0.01).

Dairy Products and Diabetes

Total Dairy Products Intake and T2DM Risk

In all, 13 studies

[10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,23,34]

including 457,893 subjects (27,095 cases) were analyzed.

In all, 13 studies(8–18; 21) including 457,893 subjects (27,095

cases) were analyzed.

High versus low intake. The summary RR for all studies
was 0.89 (95% CI 0.81–0.98), with moderate heterogeneity,
I2 = 65.4% and Pheterogeneity = 0.000 (Figure 3A).

Dose–response analysis. The summary RR for an increase
of 200 g/day was 0.94 (0.91–0.97), with moderate heterogeneity,
I2 = 51.6%, Pheterogeneity = 0.02 (Figure 3B). On subgroup analysis
(Table 2), we found an inverse association of total dairy intake and
T2DM risk in all strata except European studies and studies not
adjusting for family history of T2DM, although in some analyses
the associations were not statistically significant. None of the
results differed significantly by sex (P = 0.21 for all comparisons).
On univariate meta-regression analysis, geographic location,
adjustment for family T2DM history, and glycemic load were
significant predictors of the heterogeneity (p = 0.05, p = 0.04 and
p = 0.04, respectively). But on multivariate meta-regression, we
failed to identify the source of heterogeneity. We found no
evidence of publication bias by Egger’s test (P = 0.37), Begg’s test
(P = 0.58) or funnel plot(see Appendix Figure 1). We also found a
nonlinear association of total dairy product intake and T2DM risk,
Pfor nonlinearity ,0.001, with most of the risk reduction occurring
with intake up to about 200 g/d; higher intake were associated
with a further but more modest decrease in risk (Figure 4A).

Low- and Full-fat Dairy Intake and T2DM Risk

8 studies [10,11,12,13,14,15,16,23] including 260,700 subjects

(9,398 cases) were analyzed.

High versus low intake. Low-fat dairy consumption was
inversely associated with T2DM risk, with a pooled RR of 0.81
(0.74–0.89)
(Figure 5A). Full-fat dairy consumption was not
associated with T2DM risk, with a summary RR of 0.95 (0.85–
1.07) (Figure 6A). We found no significant heterogeneity for the
associations of low-fat (I2 = 1.8%; Pheterogeneity = 0.42) or full-fat
dairy consumption (I2 = 38.1%; Pheterogeneity = 0.13).

Dose–response analysis. The summary RR for a 200-g/
day increase in low-fat dairy intake was 0.88 (0.84–0.93), with no
evidence of heterogeneity, I2 = 16.3% and Pheterogeneity = 0.32
(Figure 5B). The summary RR for a 200-g/day increase in full-fat
dairy intake was 0.95 (0.88–1.04), with evidence of heterogeneity,
I2 = 52.2% and Pheterogeneity = 0.04 (Figure 6B). We found an
inverse association of low-fat dairy intake and T2DM risk for all
strata, although in some analyses
the associations were not
statistically significant (Table 2). On univariate meta-regression
analysis, the effect was weaker, although not significantly,

Other dairy products

Intake of other types of dairy products except ice cream (n = 2
studies) were not significantly associated with T2DM risk (0.84
[0.73–0.95]). The pooled RR for total fermented dairy intake
(n = 3 studies) was 0.94 (0.75–1.18) and cream (n = 2 studies) was
0.96 (0.84–1.12).

Discussion

This meta-analysis showed that total dairy intake was associated
with a 6% lower risk of T2DM per 200 g/day consumption. When
examining different types of dairy products in relation to T2DM
risk, we found significant inverse associations of intake of low-fat
dairy, low-fat milk, cheese and yogurt and T2DM. We found no
association of intake of full-fat dairy as well as total and full-fat
milk and T2DM. We also clarified a nonlinear association of both
total and low-fat dairy intake and incidence of T2DM.

The hypothesis that dairy products intake protects against
T2DM has received much interest among medical professionals
and the general population. In intervention studies, the Dietary
Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet (a dietary pattern
focusing on low-fat milk and other dairy products) increased high-
density lipoprotein levels, reduced triglycerides levels, reduced
blood pressure (both systolic and diastolic), contributed to weight
loss, and reduced fasting blood glucose in both men and women as
compared with the control diet [36]. In epidemiological studies,
the association of dairy products intake and T2DM has been
explored with inconsistent results [37].

Our findings for high versus low dairy intake are consistent with
results from previous meta-analyses [24], which only included 7
studies. High versus
low analyses are limited because true
differences in the level and range of intake between studies are
not considered and may contribute to heterogeneity in the results.
With the accumulated evidence, we were able to enhance the
precision of the risk estimates, perform dose–response analyses of
different dairy products and explore the shape of
the dose–
response curve and sources of heterogeneity, thereby increasing
the clinical relevance of our findings [38].

In addition, the presence of both linear and nonlinear dose–
response relationships of specific dairy products strengthened the
findings of an association of dairy products intake and risk of
T2DM. In the linear dose-response analysis, we found a 6% and
12% lower risk of T2DM per 200 g/day intake of total and low-fat
dairy products,
respectively. Furthermore, we discovered a
potential nonlinear association of total and low-fat dairy products
intake and T2DM. A low threshold of 200 g/day total dairy and
300 g/day low fat dairy may reduce the risk by about 10% or 15%
respectively. Intake above that level seems to have further but
modest additional benefit for T2DM risk.

Dairy is a major source of dietary calcium and magnesium, 2
minerals that have a role in the development of T2DM, for potential
in improving pancreatic B-cell function and insulin sensitivity [39].
Experimental [39], prospective cohort studies [40,41] and a recent
meta-analysis [42] have provided convincing evidence to support
the direct effects of calcium and magnesium intake on insulin
resistance and T2DM. In this study, we found that the association of
dairy intake and T2DM risk remained unchanged after adjusting
for diet calcium and/or magnesium (7 studies), so other major
components in dairy products could account for the association.
Recently, the beneficial physiological effects of dairy protein, such as

cases) were analyzed. For 6 studies [11,17,18,19,22,23], data were
available on the association of total milk intake and T2DM risk,
for 3 studies [13,15,20], milk consumption was analyzed as full-fat
milk (or whole milk) and low-fat milk (or skim milk) and for 1
study, data was reported as full fat milk only [35]. The summary
RR for total milk intake was 0.89 (0.78–1.01), with moderate
heterogeneity, I2 = 51.8% and P heterogeneity = 0.043. The summary
RR for low-fat and full-fat milk intake was 0.82 (0.69–0.97,
I2 = 40% and Pheterogeneity = 0.19) and 1.12 (0.99–1.27, I2 = 0%
and Pheterogeneity = 0.79), respectively (Figure 7).

Dose–response analysis. 8 studies [11,13,15,17,18,19,20,22,23]
were analyzed. The summary RR for a 200-g/day increase in total milk
intake was 0.89 (0.79–1.01), with evidence of moderate heterogeneity,
I2 = 66.3% and Pheterogeneity = 0.005 (data not shown). The summary
RR for a 200-g/day increase in full- and low-fat milk intake was 1.27
(0.97–1.67, I2 = 0% and Pheterogeneity = 0.58) and 0.83 (0.70–1.00,
I2 = 14% and Pheterogeneity = 0.21), respectively.

Yogurt and Cheese Intake and T2DM Risk

Seven studies [11,12,13,15,17,19,20] including 254,552 subjects
(18,532 cases) were analyzed for yogurt intake. Seven studies
[11,13,15,17,19,20,23] including 178,429 subjects (14,810 cases)
were analyzed for cheese intake.

High versus low intake. Yogurt and cheese intake were
inversely associated with T2DM risk. The pooled RRs were 0.85

whey protein, on the control of food intake and glucose metabolism
have been reported. Studies have shown the insulinotropic and
glucose-lowering properties of whey protein in healthy and T2DM
subjects [43]. Furthermore, in addition to milk proteins, trans-
palmitoleate, obtained primarily from dairy intake, is associated
with reduced incidence of diabetes [9].

Our analysis of high- and low-fat dairy products revealed an
inverse association of only low-fat dairy food intake and T2DM
risk. This

from residual confounding by factors related to a more unhealthy
diet or lifestyle. On the other hand, we can not rule out the
association between the intake of saturated fatty acid (SFA). Dairy
products contributed to 15% of the total dietary SFA intake [45].
Although prospective cohorts demonstrate no significant associa-
tion between SFA intake and risk of T2DM, some findings from
experimental and observational studies have showed that SFA
intake was inversely associated with insulin sensitivity [45,46,47].
Finally,
the likelihood of publication bias effects may cause

that publication bias could account

uncertain results. For analysis of the milk products, only 3 of 14
studies separately evaluated whole vs. low-fat milk, and thus it
seems
for the observed
difference between low vs. whole fat milk. Furthermore, because
cheese, even low-fat cheese, has higher fat and saturated fat than
whole milk yet was still associated with lower risk, it appears less
likely that the observed difference between whole fat and low fat
milk would be due to higher fat or saturated fat content in whole
milk. Further confirmatory results of appropriately powered
studies are still needed.

Cheese, which has far more fat than whole-fat milk, more than
half of which is saturated Evidence suggests that saturated fat intake
has an adverse effect on insulin sensitivity and increases the risk of
T2DM. In our analysis, we found inverse association between both
cheese and yogurt intake and incidence of T2DM. The exact
mechanisms responsible for the significant
inverse association
between cheese and yogurt and T2DM are unknown. It could be
partly explained by the fact that both dairy subgroups are a good
source for vitamin K2. Vitamin K2 is exclusively synthesized by
bacteria and is therefore only present in fermented dairy products
such as cheese and yogurt due to the bacterial starter fermentation
[48]. Vitamin K2 has recently been linked to a reduced risk of
T2DM [49]. Additionally, these dairy subcategories are particularly
high in the fat-soluble vitamin D, which has been found to be
inversely associated with T2DM [50,51].

We did not

find a consistent pattern of difference or
heterogeneity in results by sex or any other study characteristics
examined, except
for geographic location, which significantly
modified the association between total dairy products intake and
T2DM risk. We found a significant inverse association among US
studies, with no evidence of a protective effect of total dairy food
intake in European or Asia studies. This may be a chance finding,
because only 3 European studies and 1 Asian study were included
in this subgroup analysis or could be due to other factors. As well,
differences in the ranges of intake or intake in the referent category
could explain these results. Because of the nonlinear association
between total dairy food intake and T2DM risk with the strongest
reduction at low levels of intake, some studies may have missed an
effect because the intake in the referent category may have been
already sufficient to reduce risk. For example, in some European
studies, intake of total dairy food in the referent category was
.200 g/d but was ,200 g/d for all US studies. As well, types of
dairy food intake may vary between populations. In addition,
differences in study size and follow-up time may contribute to the
variations. Further cohort studies of specific dairy products and
T2DM risk in different populations are needed.

Our meta-analysis contains some limitations. Publication bias is
a major concern for analyses that depend on only a few studies.
For example, in our analysis, only 4 of the 15 studies separately
evaluated full or low-fat milk. So the efficiency of analysis on
different milk production was limited. The inverse association we
found between dairy products intake and T2DM risk could be due
to unmeasured or residual confounding. Higher intake of dairy
products, especially low-fat dairy products, is often associated with
other lifestyle factors, including increased physical activity, low
prevalence of smoking, and overweight/obesity, although different
types of dairy products may be differentially associated with some
of these confounders. In addition, the results were generally similar
in the subgroup analyses when we stratified results by adjustment
for confounding factors or other study characteristics, with no

heterogeneity between subgroups for total and low-fat dairy
product consumption. Only the analysis of total dairy products
revealed some indication of heterogeneity, with studies
that
adjusted for
family history of T2DM showing an inverse
association with T2DM; studies that did not adjust for family
history of T2DM showed a nonsignificant positive association,
which suggests potential confounding.

Measurement errors in the assessment of dietary intake are
known to bias effect estimates. Our results are based on data from
cohort studies, in which dairy intake was mostly assessed by food-
frequency questionnaires. In several studies, validation of the food-
frequency questionnaires showed good correlations, of <0.6–0.7
for milk or (if not assessed) for protein and calcium, which are
good indicators for milk intake. However, we cannot exclude that
measurement errors might have resulted in attenuated associa-
tions. Dietary changes after baseline can also attenuate associa-
tions of dietary intake and T2DM risk; however, only 7 of the
included studies [12,13,14,17,18,22,23] used repeated assessments
of diet, and the results were similar when using only the baseline
questionnaire for the analyses (data not shown). Furthermore,
dietary intake data were collected between 1984 and 2003. In
earlier studies, full-fat dairy was a major contributor to total dairy
intake, whereas in later studies intake was more often low-fat dairy
and publication year may have explained the study heterogeneity
the studies were conducted
(p = 0.02). Finally, because all
primarily among middle-aged and older people,
these results
might not be generalizable to dairy intake in earlier life periods,
which might have similar or different effects.

In conclusion, our results suggest a inverse association of intake
of dairy products, such as low-fat dairy, cheese and yogurt and
T2DM risk. Further cohort studies are warranted to investigate
the specific types of dairy products in the association, the impact of
measurement errors on estimates, any gender-specific recommen-
dations, and biomarkers of dairy intake.

Context Clinical trials using antihyperglycemic medications to improve glycemic con-
trol have not demonstrated the anticipated cardiovascular benefits. Low–glycemic in-
dex diets may improve both glycemic control and cardiovascular risk factors for pa-
tients with type 2 diabetes but debate over their effectiveness continues due to trial
limitations.
Objective To test the effects of low–glycemic index diets on glycemic control and
cardiovascular risk factors in patients with type 2 diabetes.
Design, Setting, and Participants A randomized, parallel study design at a Ca-
nadian university hospital research center of 210 participants with type 2 diabetes treated
with antihyperglycemic medications who were recruited by newspaper advertisement
and randomly assigned to receive 1 of 2 diet treatments each for 6 months between
September 16, 2004, and May 22, 2007.
Intervention High–cereal fiber or low–glycemic index dietary advice.
Main Outcome Measures Absolute change in glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), with
fasting blood glucose and cardiovascular disease risk factors as secondary measures.
Results In the intention-to-treat analysis, HbA1c decreased by −0.18% absolute HbA1c
units (95% confidence interval [CI], −0.29% to −0.07%) in the high–cereal fiber diet
compared with −0.50% absolute HbA1c units (95% CI, −0.61% to −0.39%) in the
low–glycemic index diet (P ⬍.001). There was also an increase of high-density lipo-
protein cholesterol in the low–glycemic index diet by 1.7 mg/dL (95% CI, 0.8-2.6 mg/
dL) compared with a decrease of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol by −0.2 mg/dL
(95% CI, −0.9 to 0.5 mg/dL) in the high–cereal fiber diet (P=.005). The reduction in
dietary glycemic index related positively to the reduction in HbA1c concentration (r=0.35,
P⬍.001) and negatively to the increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (r=−0.19,
P=.009).
Conclusion In patients with type 2 diabetes, 6-month treatment with a low–
glycemic index diet resulted in moderately lower HbA1c levels compared with a high–
cereal fiber diet.

THE NEED FOR IMPLEMENTA-

tion of effective dietary strate-
gies in diabetes prevention and
management has been empha-
sized by the success of diet and life-
style changes in preventing diabetes in
high-risk patients.1 There is also con-
cern that use of antihyperglycemic
medications to improve glycemic con-
trol in type 2 diabetes may not always
significantly improve cardiovascular
outcomes.2-7

One dietary strategy aimed at im-
proving both diabetes control and car-
diovascular risk factors is the use of
low–glycemic index diets.8-10 These diets
have been reported to benefit the

control of diabetes11; increase high-
density lipoprotein cholesterol
(HDL-C)12,13; lower serum triglycer-
ide, plasminogen activator inhibitor 1,
and high-sensitivity C-reactive pro-
tein (CRP) concentrations14-16; and re-
duce diabetes incidence8,9 and overall
cardiovascular events.10 Use of the ␣-

glucosidase carbohydrate absorption in-
hibitor acarbose, which effectively
creates a low–glycemic index diet by

sorption, similarly reduced not only the
rate of progression to diabetes in high-
risk individuals but also the incidence
of hypertension and the risk of cardio-
vascular disease.17,18 Nonetheless, the
relevance and practicality of applying
the low–glycemic index dietary ap-
proach to the treatment of diabetes has
been questioned.19-21 Furthermore, al-
though meta-analyses of clinical stud-
ies have indicated a benefit in diabetes
in terms of reduced glycated pro-
teins,11 individual trials have often failed
to demonstrate a clear benefit for low–
glycemic index diets.11,22 However, these
trials have usually been of short dura-
tion with relatively small numbers of
participants.11 An exception is a re-
cent larger and longer trial,22 but in that
study, the mean baseline glycated he-
moglobin A1c (HbA1c) concentration
was already relatively low at 6.1%, thus
making it difficult to demonstrate ben-
efit from the intervention.

Our goal in this study was to assess
the effect of a low–glycemic index diet
in an adequately powered study of pa-
tients with type 2 diabetes controlled
by oral medications with HbA1c con-
centrations between 6.5% and 8.0%. At
these levels, a reduction in glycemia and
associated risk factors for diabetes com-
plications are likely to be observed more
clearly. We selected a high–cereal fi-
ber diet treatment for its suggested
health benefits8,9,23-25 for the compari-
son so that the potential value of car-
bohydrate foods could be emphasized
equally for both high–cereal fiber and
low–glycemic index interventions.

METHODS
Participants
Study participants were recruited from
local newspaper advertisements. Out of
2220 responses by telephone, 981 par-
ticipants were considered potentially
eligible and were invited to attend an
information session at the Risk Factor
Modification Center, St Michael’s Hos-
pital, Toronto, Ontario, Canada, where
all study clinical activity took place. Of
those participants invited, 658 at-
tended a screening appointment. A total

of 389 participants were ineligible and
269 were eligible; however, 6 partici-
pants could not be contacted, 5 were
unable to start the study immediately,
and 48 declined to continue. The re-
maining 210 participants were random-
ized (FIGURE 1). Recruitment took place
between July 8, 2004, and December 5,
2006, with the last follow-up visit on
May 22, 2007. Eligible participants were

men or postmenopausal women with
type 2 diabetes who were taking oral
medications other than acarbose to con-
trol their diabetes, with medications
stable for the previous 3 months, and
who had HbA1c values at screening be-
tween 6.5% and 8.0% (to convert to
proportion of total hemoglobin, mul-
tiply by 0.01). None had clinically sig-
nificant cardiovascular, renal, or liver

times the upper limit of normal) and
none were undergoing treatment for
cancer. Participants were accepted af-
ter surgery or myocardial infarction pro-
viding an event-free, 6-month period
had elapsed before the study.

After randomization, it was found
that 5 participants had not been ex-
cluded who were taking acarbose and
had not subsequently been advised to
stop taking acarbose, and 2 partici-
pants were not taking diabetes medi-
cations. In addition, 8 participants had
changed their medications within 3
months before the start of the study and
2 women were not postmenopausal.
Furthermore, at the start of the trial, 9
participants (6 in the low–glycemic in-
dex diet and 3 in the high–cereal fiber
diet) did not receive the appropriate di-
etary advice for the treatment to which
they had been randomized. This error
was corrected within the first 4 weeks
of the study. Nevertheless, all random-
ized participants were retained both for
the intention-to-treat (ITT) and study
completion analyses.

Race/ethnicity was determined by a
member of the research team (S.M.) and
included to allow for future subgroup
analyses when genetic data (to be de-
termined) become available. The study
was approved by the research ethics
board of St Michael’s Hospital and the
University of Toronto, Toronto, On-
tario, Canada, and written consent was
obtained from all participants.

Protocol
Our study was a randomized, parallel
study with 2 treatments, a low–
glycemic index diet and a high–cereal
fiber diet, each of 6 months’ duration.
After stratification by sex and HbA1c
(ⱕ7.1%), randomization was per-
formed by using participant identifica-
tion (subject ID) by a statistician (E.V.)
who was geographically separated from
the center at which participants were
observed. Neither the dietitians who
were responsible for the day-to-day run-
ning of the study nor the participants
could be blinded to the treatment al-
location. The technical staff involved in

the analyses were blinded to treat-
ment, as was the statistician up to and
during the preliminary assessment of
the primary outcome, HbA1c. In addi-
tion, during the study, equally strong
emphasis was placed by dietitians on
the potential importance of either high–
cereal fiber foods or low–glycemic in-
dex foods and appropriate weekly
checklists were developed for each
treatment.

Participants were observed at the
Clinical Nutrition and Risk Factor
Modification Center at baseline, weeks
2 and 4, and thereafter at monthly in-
tervals until the end of the 6-month pe-
riod. During the first month, partici-
pants received instructions regarding
the diet to which they were allocated.
Throughout the study, this advice was
reinforced by the dietitians. At all cen-
ter visits, participants were weighed in
indoor clothing without shoes and a
fasting blood sample was taken. Blood
pressure was measured seated on 3 oc-
casions at 1-minute intervals using an
Omron automatic sphygmomanom-
eter (OMRON Healthcare Inc, Burling-
ton, Ontario, Canada) and the mean of
the 3 measurements was taken. In ad-
dition, participants brought with them
their 7-day food record covering the
week before the visit; this was dis-
cussed with the dietitian together with
their checklist of low–glycemic index
or high–cereal fiber food items re-
corded on a daily basis throughout the
study. Participants noted their overall
feeling of satiety or hunger over the pre-
vious weeks on a scale of ⫹4 to −4,
where ⫹4 was extremely satiated, 0 was
neutral, and −4 was extremely hun-
gry. For the last 114 participants who
were enrolled in the study, adherence
was rated formally under 1 of 3 catego-
ries (good, adequate but may need ad-
ditional encouragement with a between-
visit telephone call, or nonadherent
with definite need for a telephone call
between scheduled visits).

During the study, participants were
asked to maintain their antihyperglyce-
mic medications constant and letters
were sent to family physicians for their
support in this matter. When patients ex-

perienced symptoms of hypoglycemia
with blood capillary glucose levels of less
than 63.1 mg/dL (to convert to milli-
moles per liter, multiply by 0.0555) for
no obvious reason, study endocrinolo-
gists (R.G.J., J.S., G.L.B., and L.A.L.) who
were blinded to treatment were con-
sulted. The patients were then referred
back to their family physicians so that
medications could be reduced accord-
ing to a predetermined protocol. If HbA1c
increased to more than 8.5% on 2 suc-
cessive occasions, participants were with-
drawn from the study and referred back
to their own physicians. Only 1 partici-
pant was withdrawn due to HbA1c being
more than 8.5% on 2 successive occa-
sions. The participant’s HbA1c was 7.6%
at recruitment, but increased to 8.2% by
baseline and was later withdrawn due to
readings of more than 8.5% during the
study.

Dietary Interventions
General dietary advice conformed to the
National Cholesterol Education Pro-
gram Adult Treatment Panel III26 and the
American Diabetes Association27 guide-
lines to reduce saturated fat and choles-
terol intakes. Most of the participants
were overweight (179/210 [85.2%], with
body mass index [BMI, calculated as
weight in kilograms divided by height in
meters squared] of ⱖ25) or obese (113/
210 [53.8%], BMI ⱖ30) and wished to
lose weight. They were informed that this
was not a weight-loss study but appro-
priate advice was given on portion size
and fat intake to help them meet their
body weight objectives. Participants were
also provided with a checklist with either
low–glycemic index or high–cereal fi-
ber food options from different catego-
ries (breakfast cereals, breads, veg-
etables, fruit) as approximately 15-g
carbohydrate servings. The number of
carbohydrate servings prescribed cov-
ered 42% to 43% of total dietary calories.
In the low–glycemic index diet, the
following foods were emphasized: low–
glycemic index breads (including pum-
pernickel, rye pita, and quinoa and flax-
seed) and breakfast cereals (including
Red River Cereal [hot cereal made of
bulgur and flax], large flake oatmeal,

cereal made of wheat bran and psyl-
lium fiber]), pasta, parboiled rice, beans,
peas, lentils, and nuts (TABLE 1). In the
high–cereal fiber diet, participants were
advised to take the “brown” option
(whole grain breads; whole grain break-
fast cereals; brown rice; potatoes with
skins; and whole wheat bread, crack-
ers, and breakfast cereals) (Table 1). Six
servings were prescribed for a 1500-
kcal diet, 8 servings for a 2000-kcal diet,
and 10 servings for a 2500-kcal diet. De-
tailed advice was also given to avoid
starchy foods not directly recom-
mended as part of the treatment, in-
cluding those foods advised in the al-
ternative treatment.

In both diets, participants were spe-
cifically advised to avoid foods such as
pancakes, muffins, donuts, white buns,
bagels, rolls, cookies, cakes, popcorn,
french fries, and chips. Three servings
of fruit and 5 servings of vegetables were
encouraged on both treatments. In the
low–glycemic index diet, temperate
fruit was the focus, including apples,
pears, oranges, peaches, cherries, and
berries; and in the high–cereal fiber diet,
tropical fruit, such as bananas, man-
gos, guavas, grapes, raisins, water-
melon, and cantaloupe, were empha-
sized. Participants were also advised
against eating fruit recommended in the
alternative treatment.

Checklists were completed by par-
ticipants on a daily basis throughout the
study and 7-day diet records were com-
pleted before each visit. Participants
were instructed on how to record using
food models as examples of portion size
and were asked to give actual weights
or to express the amounts in terms of
common measures, including cups, tea-
spoons, and dessert spoons. Adher-
ence was assessed from the 7-day diet
records. The daily checklists were of
value in alerting the dietitian to prob-
lems with adherence to the diet plan
over the month before center atten-
dance. The overall goal was to achieve
a 10% to 20% reduction in glycemic in-
dex on the low–glycemic index diet
while keeping dietary fiber similar be-
tween treatments.

Analyses
Blood glucose was measured in the hos-
pital routine analytical laboratory by a
glucose oxidase method using a Ran-
dom Access Analyzer and reagents
(SYNCHRON LX Systems; Beckman
Coulter, Brea, California), with coeffi-
cient of variation between assays of
1.9%. HbA1c was analyzed within 2 days
of collection on whole blood collected
in EDTA Vacutainer tubes and mea-
sured by a designated high-perfor-
mance liquid chromatography method
(Tosoh G7 Automated HPLC Ana-
lyzer, Grove City, Ohio), with coeffi-
cient of variation of 1.7%.

Serum was analyzed for total choles-
terol, triglycerides, and HDL-C by using
a Random Access Analyzer and reagents
(SYNCHRON LX Systems), with coeffi-
cient of variation of 1.5% to 2.4%. Low-
density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C)

was calculated by the method of Friede-
wald et al28 [LDL-C=total cholesterol−
(triglycerides/5 ⫹ HDL-C)] in mg/dL (to
convertHDL-CandLDL-Ctomillimoles
per liter, multiply by 0.0259). C-reactive
proteinwasmeasuredbyendpointneph-
elometry (Behring BN-100, N high-
sensitivity CRP reagent; Dade-Behring,
Marburg, Germany), with coefficient of
variation of 2.3%. Diets were assessed for

Outcome Measures
The primary outcome measure was
HbA1c, with glucose, HDL-C, triglycer-
ides, CRP, blood pressure, and body
weight as secondary outcome measures.

Power Calculations
The original power calculation was
based on a predicted HbA1c difference

between end of treatments of 0.7 HbA1c
units, with an SD of effect of 1.2 HbA1c
units, ␣=.05, 1−␤=.80, and a dropout
rate of 25%. Our participant require-
ment was 67 for each treatment. How-
ever, the preliminary results of a large
(but at the time unpublished) study that
assessed the diet effect on HbA1c sug-
gested our effect size would be smaller

than we had originally predicted.22 In
an unplanned interim analysis, we con-
firmed a smaller than predicted differ-
ence in the change in HbA1c between
treatments for the first 58 participants
to complete the study. Our revised
goal therefore was to detect a differ-
ence of half of an SD (0.6%) in the
change in HbA1c between treatments
(change = 0.3%), with type I error of
2.53% (Bonferroni adjustment to al-
low for the initial analysis of the pre-
liminary ITT HbA1c data with ␣=.05)
and type II error of 20%. Assuming a
loss of 25% of participants due to drop-
outs and medication changes, 104 par-
ticipants were needed in each treat-
ment group.

Statistical Analyses
Results are expressed as means with
95% confidence intervals (CIs). All
analyses were performed by using SAS
version 9.1.2.31 Three participant
groups were analyzed. The first and pri-
mary analysis was an ITT analysis,
which included all 210 randomized par-
ticipants, with the baseline observa-
tion carried forward, rather than the last
observation, for all those who did not
complete the study. This procedure was
used to recognize that these individu-
als would most likely have reverted to
their previous diets and behavioral pat-
terns, resulting also in a reversion to
their previous level of diabetic con-
trol. Participants who were random-
ized but did not receive intervention
(n=11) had their screening value used
as baseline and this value was carried
forward. The second analysis in-
cluded 155 participants who com-
pleted the study (completer analysis),
and the third analysis involved 124 par-
ticipants who completed the study ac-
cording to the protocol but who did not
change their antihyperglycemic medi-
cations before or during the study pe-
riod (per-protocol analysis).

The significance of treatment differ-
ences was assessed by using an analy-
sis of covariance model (Proc GLM)31
with change from baseline to end of
study as the response variable and diet
and sex as main effects, with diet ⫻ sex

as the interaction term and baseline as
a covariate. Additional analyses were
also performed to assess the effects of
possible factors at baseline associated
with diabetes outcome, including ad-
equate glycemic control (HbA 1 c
ⱕ7.0%), normal BMI (⬍25), younger
age (⬍60 years), and smoking. The
analysis of covariance model for these
analyses was the basic model de-
scribed above together with the main
effect of interest and its diet interac-
tion. The time trends were estimated by
using Proc GLM in SAS and the re-
peated statement assuming a spatial
power covariance structure to control
for unevenly spaced time intervals be-
tween measurements. This is an au-
toregressive test assuming correla-
tions between successive observations.
A significant time trend therefore in-
dicates a monotonic relationship be-
tween time and change in the study
measurement. HbA1c, glucose, HDL-C,
and the lipid ratios with HDL-C in the
denominator showed significant time
trends. No time trend was observed be-
tween weeks 2 to 24 for the other
measurements.

Additional analyses were performed
by using change in fiber, carbohydrate
intake, and body weight as covariates

in the analysis of covariance model
(Proc GLM).31 For skewed data, the re-
sults were confirmed with nonparamet-
ric analysis but only parametric analy-
ses are reported. The Mantel-Haenszel,
␹2 test, and Fisher exact tests were used
to assess differences in medication
changes31 and baseline comparisons.
Pearson product-moment correlations
were calculated to examine associa-
tions of dietary fiber, glycemic index, and
body weight change with other vari-
ables of interest. Partial correlations con-
trolling for either change in body weight,
fiber, or glycemic index were also un-
dertaken to examine the independent as-
sociation of fiber and glycemic index with
the variables of interest.31

RESULTS
The participant flow diagram is shown
in Figure 1. Eleven participants dropped
out after randomization but before
their baseline visit and were therefore
unaware of their treatment allocation
(5 in the high–cereal fiber diet group
and 6 in the low–glycemic index
diet group). After starting the high–
cereal fiber diet, 23 of 99 participants
(23%) dropped out compared with 19
of 100 participants (19%) in the low–
glycemic index diet group.

There were no treatment differ-
ences at baseline (TABLE 2), with the
exception of more carbohydrate and less
fat consumed before the high–cereal fi-
ber diet compared with the low–
glycemic index diet (TABLE 3). By the
end of the study, although carbohy-
drate intake increased similarly on both
treatments, fiber intake increased
slightly more with the low–glycemic in-
dex diet (18.7 g/1000 kcal at week 24)
than with the high–cereal fiber diet
(15.7 g/1000 kcal at week 24; P⬍.001).
The glycemic index decreased with the
low–glycemic index diet (from 80.8 to
69.6 glycemic index units) compared
with an increase in the high–cereal fi-
ber diet (from 81.5 to 83.5 glycemic in-
dex units), indicating adherence with
the low–glycemic index diet (P⬍.001)
(Table 3). In the assessment of the last
114 participants enrolled, the dieti-
tians rated adherence similarly and poor
in 8 of 58 participants (13.8%) in the
high–cereal fiber diet group and in 6 of
56 participants (10.7%) in the low–
glycemic index diet group. Satiety rat-
ings (scale, ⫹4 to –4) were also simi-
lar in both diets (high–cereal fiber diet
[n=94], 0.79; 95% CI, 0.60-0.98; and
low–glycemic index diet [n=93], 0.74;
95% CI, 0.57-0.91; P=.71).

Glycemic Control and Body Weight
In the ITT analysis, antihyperglyce-
mic medication dosages increased simi-
larly in both treatments (3 partici-
pants in low–glycemic index diet and
3 participants in high–cereal fiber diet),
but dosage reductions were more fre-
quent in the low–glycemic index diet
group (13 participants in low–
glycemic index diet and 4 participants
in high–cereal fiber diet, P=.06).

In the ITT analysis, HbA1 c de-
creased by –0.50% absolute HbA1c units
(95% CI, –0.61% to –0.39%) in the low–
glycemic index diet compared with
–0.18% absolute HbA1c units (95% CI,
–0.29% to –0.07%) in the high–cereal
fiber diet (FIGURE 2). The relative
change in absolute HbA1c units in the

low–glycemic index diet compared with
the high–cereal fiber diet was –0.33%
(95% CI, –0.48% to –0.17%) (P ⬍.001
and P = .001 after Bonferroni correc-
tion) (TABLE 4). A treatment differ-
ence was observed in glucose of –6.8
mg/dL (95% CI, –12.9 to –0.6 mg/dL;
P=.02). Difference in body weight re-
duction was not significant (–0.9 kg;
95% CI, –1.71 to –0.04 kg; P = .053)
(Table 4). An additional assessment de-
termined that the reduction in HbA1c
in the low–glycemic index diet was still
significant after controlling for changes
in body weight (P = .002), fiber
(P ⬍.001), or carbohydrate (P ⬍.001)
separately as covariates in the analysis
of covariance model. No significant in-
teractions were observed between diet

and the following factors: sex, base-
line glycemic control, age, or BMI in re-
lation to the treatment effect on HbA1c.
The diet and smoking interaction ap-
proached significance (P = .06), al-
though in the low–glycemic index diet
group, the HbA1c response was similar
in the 12 participants who were smok-
ers (–0.65%) compared with the non-
smokers (–0.48%). However, the smok-
ers were too few to allow meaningful
conclusions. Exclusion of the smokers
from the analysis of covariance model as-
sessment of the change in HbA1c made
no difference to the significance of the
treatment effect favoring the low–
glycemic index diet (nonsmokers
[n=196], –0.33%; P⬍.001; vs includ-
ing smokers [n=210], –0.32%; P⬍.001).

No significant treatment differences were
observed in lipid medication changes, but
significant treatment effects were ob-
served for HDL-C and the LDL-C:
HDL-C ratio (Figure 2). In the ITT analy-
sis, HDL-C increased in the low–
glycemic index diet group by 1.7 mg/dL
(95% CI, 0.8 to 2.6 mg/dL) and de-
creased by –0.2 mg/dL (95% CI, –0.9 to
0.5 mg/dL) in the high–cereal fiber diet
group (P=.005) (Table 4). Adjusting for
change in body weight, carbohydrate, or
fiber intake did not affect the signifi-
cance of HDL-C in the ITT cohort
(P=.01, P=.004, and P=.009, respec-
tively). As a consequence, the LDL-C:
HDL-C ratio showed a greater reduc-
tion in the low–glycemic index diet
group (–0.12; 95% CI, –0.23 to –0.01)
compared with the high–cereal fiber diet
group (–0.01; 95% CI, –0.09 to 0.08;
P=.047).

Blood Pressure
The number of participants who changed
blood pressure medications was not
different between treatments (low–
glycemic index diet, 5 increased and 5
decreased; vs high–cereal fiber diet, 3 in-
creased and 8 decreased; P=.18). Sys-
tolic and diastolic blood pressure
dropped slightly in both diets, but the
treatment differences did not reach sig-
nificance (Table 4).

C-Reactive Protein
For the ITT analysis, the reductions
from baseline at 24 weeks were –1.6
mg/L (95% CI, –2.9 to –0.3 mg/L;
P=.02) in the low–glycemic index diet
and –1.8 mg/L (95% CI, –3.9 to 0.4
mg/L; P=.11) in the high–cereal fiber
diet (Table 4). The reductions in both
treatments were similar (P=.78).

Associations Between Glycemic
Index, Fiber, and Body Weight
With Outcome Measures
In the ITT analysis (TABLE 5), the re-
duction in dietary glycemic index was
positively associated with the reduc-
tion in HbA1c (n=195, r=0.35, P⬍.001)
and negatively associated with HDL-C
(n=195, r=–0.19, P=.009).

Change in body weight was signifi-
cantly related to HbA1c (n=210, r=0.50,
P ⬍ .001), blood glucose (n = 210,
r = 0.36, P ⬍ .001), systolic (n = 209,
r = 0.14, P = .04) and diastolic blood
pressure (n=209, r=0.20, P=.005), and
negatively associated with HDL-C
(n=210, r=–0.19, P=.007). No signifi-
cant associations were observed with di-
etary fiber apart from systolic blood
pressure (n = 195, r = –0.16, P = .03)
(Table 5).

Partial correlations indicated that af-
ter controlling for change in body
weight the association between change
in glycemic index and change in HbA1c
remained significant (r=0.28, P⬍.001),
as it did after controlling for change in
fiber (r=0.33, P⬍.001). In contrast, the
association between change in fiber and
change in HbA1c was still nonsignifi-
cant after controlling for change in gly-
cemic index (r=–0.02, P=.75).

Adverse Events
There were no serious adverse events di-
rectly related to the study; however, of
the 11 participants who reduced their
diabetes medications, all 6 who had clear

evidence of hypoglycemic symptoms or
low blood glucose levels were taking
low–glycemic index diets. In addition, 1
participant in the low–glycemic index
diet was withdrawn due to high HbA1c
(⬎8.5%) on 2 successive measure-
ments but the HbA1c had increased from
7.6% at screening to 8.2% at the start of
the study. The further increase during the
study did not therefore appear related to
the intervention.

Completer and Per-Protocol
Results
In general, the completer and per-
protocol analyses confirmed the ITT
analysis but showed larger effect
sizes and greater significance levels
(FIGURE 3). The completer analysis
showed a significant reduction in an-
tihyperglycemic medication use in the
low–glycemic index diet group (low–
glycemic index diet, 13/15 medication
changes vs high–cereal fiber diet, 3/6
medication changes; P=.02). Greater re-
ductions in HbA1c were observed in the
low–glycemic index diet (–0.66%; 95%
CI, –0.79% to –0.53%) compared with
in the high–cereal fiber diet (–0.24%;

and an increase in HDL-C in the low–
glycemic index diet (2.2 mg/dL; 95% CI,
1.0 to 3.5 mg/dL) compared with in the
high–cereal fiber diet (–0.3 mg/dL; 95%
CI, –1.3 to 0.7 mg/dL; P=.01).

The results of the per-protocol analy-
sis were similar except that the reduc-
tion in the blood glucose was no longer
significant but a significantly greater re-
duction was observed in body weight
in the low–glycemic index diet (–3.6 kg;
95% CI, –4.6 to –2.5 kg) compared with
in the high–cereal fiber diet (–2.3 kg;
95% CI, –2.9 to –1.6 kg; P=.04).

COMMENT
Lowering the glycemic index of the diet
improved glycemic control and risk fac-
tors for coronary heart disease (CHD).
These data have important implica-
tions for the treatment of diabetes where
the goal has been tight glycemic con-
trol to avoid complications.32

The reduction in HbA1c was mod-
est, but we think it has clinical rel-
evance. Reductions in HbA1c of 1% and
0.67%, respectively, in the United King-
dom Prospective Diabetes Study2 and
ADVANCE6 studies resulted in 37% and
21% reductions in microvascular com-
plications of diabetes. Our 0.33% HbA1c
treatment difference might therefore be
expected to reduce microvascular com-
plications by 10% to 12% and possibly

more in the longer term, because there
was a significant time trend for HbA1c
with a tendency for separation of low–
glycemic index and high–cereal fiber
values over time. Furthermore, the US
Food and Drug Administration recog-
nizes a 0.3% to 0.4% reduction in HbA1c
as clinically meaningful in the devel-
opment of drugs for diabetes treat-
ment,33 and the reduction in HbA1c ob-
served in our study was achieved in
individuals already treated with 1 or
more antihyperglycemic medications,
and without weight gain, which often
accompanies treatment with glucose-
lowering medications.6,7,23

Pharmacological interventions to im-
prove glycemic control in type 2 dia-
betes have often failed to show a sig-
nificant reduction in cardiovascular
events.2-5 In view of the 2- to 4-fold in-
crease in CHD risk in participants with
type 2 diabetes, the ability of a low–
glycemic index diet to address both gly-
cemic control and CHD risk factors in-
creases the clinical relevance of this
approach for patients with type 2 dia-
betes, such as those in this study, who
are overweight and also taking statins
for CHD risk reduction.

Low HDL-C is one of the character-
istics of the dyslipidemia associated
with type 2 diabetes and may be part
of the reason for the increased CHD risk
observed in type 2 diabetes.34 Current

data suggest a 1:1 to 1:3 relationship be-
tween the percentage increase in HDL-C
and the reduction in CHD risk.35-37 By
this reasoning, the 4.7% increase in
HDL-C observed in our study in the
low–glycemic index treatment group
might reduce CHD risk by 4% to 11%
in the ITT group and 6% to 19% in the
completer group. Previous cross-
sectional studies have noted a nega-
tive relationship between glycemic in-
dex12,13 or glycemic load14 and HDL-C.
One short-term randomized con-
trolled trial of patients with type 2 dia-
betes also observed an increase in
HDL-C in a low–glycemic index diet,38
which was also observed in our study.
In our study, the reduction in CRP
in the high–cereal fiber diet group was
not significant, although significant re-
ductions have been shown previ-
ously.39 The low–glycemic index diet re-
duced CRP levels similarly but the
reduction from baseline was signifi-
cant. This effect has been reported in
earlier studies.16,22

Our study has a number of limita-
tions. The dropout rate during the treat-
ment periods was high at 21% (42/
199 participants). However, these
numbers are in keeping with many nu-
tritional studies.40 Furthermore, the sig-
nificance of the data was not materi-
ally altered when only the completers
were assessed. As observed in other

studies,41 a substantial number of par-
ticipants (11%, n=23) had antihyper-
glycemic medication changes during the
study. Only 6 participants had clear evi-
dence of repeated hypoglycemic epi-
sodes or low blood glucose levels, but
all of these occurred in the low–
glycemic index diet group. Further-
more, retention of participants with
medication changes in the analysis did
not result in loss of significance in es-
tablished treatment differences. Di-
etary fiber intakes were not com-
pletely balanced between treatments
with an approximately 4.6 g/d higher
fiber intake in the low–glycemic in-
dex diet than in the high–cereal fiber
diet at week 24. Viscous fibers or diets

high in fiber from a variety of sources
have been shown to improve blood lip-
ids and markers of glycemic con-
trol.24,42 However, with the exception
of oat and barley fiber, cereal fibers are
largely without metabolic effect. In-
creasing dietary intake of wheat fiber,
even by as much as 20 g/d, has been
shown not to influence HbA1c or other
biomarkers of chronic disease in pa-
tients with type 2 diabetes.43 In addi-
tion, controlling for fiber intake as a co-
variate in the analysis of covariance
analysis did not alter the significance
of the results. Similarly, controlling for
fiber in the partial regression analysis
did not alter the significance of the as-
sociation of the change in glycemic in-

dex with change in HbA1c. A further po-
tential weakness was that our study was
a single-site study, which may be seen
as a limitation to its generalizability.

Study strengths include the indepen-
dence of the effect of glycemic index on
HbA1c from the fiber or carbohydrate in-
take and the similarity of the observed
HbA1c effect with the magnitude of re-
duction in glycated proteins observed in
a meta-analysis.11 Another strength of our
study was the comparison of the low–
glycemic index diet with a high–cereal
fiber diet representing another treat-
ment rather than simply a control.
Increased cereal fiber intakes have
been associated with reduced incidence
of diabetes and CHD in the longer

term8,9,23-25 and so provided a reason for
dietary adherence.

Body weight is recognized as a ma-
jor determinant of glycemic con-
trol.27,44 However, in our study, the
treatment difference in HbA1c re-
mained even after controlling for body
weight. Neither the effect of over-
weight nor the interaction of diet with
overweight was significant. Low–
glycemic index or low–glycemic load
diets have been associated with weight
loss,45,46 although the weight loss was
not significant (P = .053) in the ITT
analysis of our study. At the same time,
weight loss resulting from altered in-
sulin economy may be one of the
mechanisms through which low–
glycemic index diets improve glyce-
mic control.47 Furthermore, interven-
tions that improve glycemic control
without increasing body weight con-
fer an additional benefit in diabetes
management by avoiding the macro-
vascular complications that may be as-
sociated with weight gain.7

In conclusion, in this study of pa-
tients with type 2 diabetes, 6-month
treatment with a low–glycemic index
diet resulted in moderately lower HbA1c
levels compared with a high–cereal fi-
ber diet. Low–glycemic index diets may
be useful as part of the strategy to im-
prove glycemic control in patients with
type 2 diabetes taking antihyperglyce-
mic medications.27,48

Several

j Abstract Background
factors can affect glycemic and
insulinemic responses from cereal
foods. Some suggested factors
lowering the responses are; intact
botanical structure, high amylose/
high ß-glucan cereal varieties,
organic acid produced during fer-
mentation and food processes
inducing retrogradation of starch.
Aim of the study To evaluate the
impact of fermented whole grain
cereal kernels with high content of
amylose (40%) and/or b-glucan
(4.6%) on postprandial glucose
and insulin responses in healthy
adults. Methods Thirteen healthy
volunteers (4 men and 9 women)
were given 25 g available carbo-
hydrate portions of: glucose solu-
tion; tempe fermented whole-grain
barley and tempe fermented
whole-grain oat. Blood samples
were collected directly before the
meal (fasting) and 15, 30, 45, 60,
90 and 120 min after the start of
the meal. The GI (glycemic index)
and II (insulin index) of meals
were calculated for each subject
according to FAO/WHO stan-
dards. Results Peak glucose re-
sponse was lowest after the tempe

meal with high-amylose/ high-ß-
glucan barley tempe while insulin
response was lowest after the meal
with high b-glucan oat tempe. The
mean blood glucose responses for
both the barley and the oat tempe
meals were signiﬁcantly lower
than from the reference glucose
load (P < 0.0001) during the ﬁrst
60 min. The calculated GI:s for
barley and oat tempe were 30 and
63, respectively. Mean serum
insulin responses from barley and
oat tempe were signiﬁcantly lower
compared with the glucose load
(P < 0.002) during the ﬁrst 60
min, and the calculated II was
lower for oat tempe (21) compared
with barley tempe (55). Conclu-
sions The results suggest that
cereal products with beneﬁcial
inﬂuence on postprandial plasma
glucose and insulin responses can
be tailored by fermentation and
enclosure of high-amylose and/or
high-b-glucan barley and oat ker-
nels.

Low post-prandial responses from high-fibre barley or oat

Introduction

Whole grains are important sources of many nutri-
ents such as dietary ﬁbre, resistant starch,
trace
minerals, vitamins, and other compounds including
phytoestrogens and antioxidants, of interest in dis-
ease prevention [28]. Increased intake of whole-grain
foods has been related to a reduced risk of developing
diabetes and heart disease [23, 24, 26]. The effect of
whole grains on carbohydrate metabolism is currently
being investigated from a number of scientiﬁc angles,
and it has been suggested that the intact botanical
structure of cereals may have a critical effect on the
metabolism of insulin and glucose. Further, a pre-
ventive potential of low glycemic index/glycemic load
(GI/GL) diets in relation to obesity and diabetes has
been graded as ‘possible’ in the most recent WHO
report [10]. Such a possibility was also strengthen by
the data from a cross sectional study by McKeown
et al. [25] demonstrating a positive relation between
dietary high GI and prevalence of the metabolic syn-
drome.

The glycemic index (GI) was introduced to classify
starchy foods according to their effect on postprandial
glycaemia [19]. The GI is deﬁned as the incremental
area under the curve (AUC) for blood glucose after
ingestion of a test product as a percentage of the
corresponding area for a reference product (glucose
or white bread). An insulinemic index (II) can be
calculated from the corresponding incremental insu-
lin AUCs. Glycemic load (GL) is the product of the
amount of carbohydrate per serve and the glycemic
index.

There are a number of food factors known to
inﬂuence postprandial glycaemia by affecting the
gastric emptying rate and/or the rate of digestion and
absorption of starch in the small intestine. Some of
these factors are related to the botanical composition
of the raw material, while others are linked to the type
and extent of food processing. Grains are composed
of endosperm, germ and bran and the endosperm
comprises 80% of the grain while germ and bran
components vary. The main element of the endo-
sperm cell walls in barley and oats is b-glucan—a
polysaccharide consisting of long linear chains of
glucose residues linked through both b-(1-3) and b-
(1-4) linkages. b-Glucan is believed to be the active
component responsible for the observed reduction of
blood glucose and insulin response after a meal
containing soluble ﬁbre [5]. Factors responsible for
the observed differences between foods in the post-
prandial glucose response also include the botanical
origin, determining the amylose/amylopectin ratio.
Consumption of breads containing 50–70% amylose
cornstarch was found to result in lower glucose and

insulin responses compared to breads made with
standard cornstarch consisting of 30% amylose and
70% amylopectin [4, 11]. Another important factor is
food processing, determining the extent of starch
gelatinisation, particle size and the integrity of the
plant cell wall. Boiled intact cereal grains such as rye,
oats, barley and wheat cause low glucose and insulin
responses [13, 18]. However, when the raw materials
are ground into ﬂours before boiling, the postprandial
glucose and insulin responses increases signiﬁcantly
[14, 22, 30]. Studies have also indicated that certain
acids, such as acetic, propionic and lactic acid pro-
duced during fermentation or added, have the ability
to lower the postprandial blood glucose and insulin
responses [21, 32]. Thus, the hypothesis of this study
was that a possible means to produce healthier foods
is to choose raw material with high levels of soluble
ﬁbre and amylose in combination with mild pro-
cessing like e.g. fermentation. Tempe is a fermented
food native of Indonesia and originally made from
soybeans inoculated with a mould of the genus Rhi-
zopus. In the present study, the potential of using
whole kernels of a high-amylose/high-b-glucan barley
and a high-b-glucan oat genotype for tempe fermen-
tation was evaluated as a means of developing cereal
products inducing low increments in glucose and
insulin levels.

Subjects and methods

j Raw materials

Whole barley grains (c.v. Karmose´) with high b-glu-
can (~6%) and high amylose content (~40%) [1] and
whole oat grains (c.v. Betania) with high b-glucan
content (~6%) were obtained from Svalo¨f Weibull AB
(Svalo¨v, Sweden). Whole-grain barley and oat tempe
were produced by Lantma¨nnen R&D (Ja¨rna, Sweden)
according to methods previously described [8]. Prior
to fermentation whole kernels were soaked in 0.3%
lactic acid for 10 h at 48°C. After soaking, kernels
were boiled (10 min in excess water), drained and
allowed to cool before inoculation with a starter cul-
ture of Rhizopus oligosporus. Barley and oat tempe
were fermented 27 h at 32°C followed by heating in an
oven (10 min, 200°C) and kept frozen ()20°C) until
served.

j Test meals

The human study and the preparation of the test
meals were performed at
the Centre for Human
Studies of Foodstuffs (KPL, Uppsala, Sweden). Frozen
barley and oat tempe were thawed in plastic bags

(15 min, 50°C) prior to preparation of the test meals.
Each portion was heated in an oven (7.5 min, 200°C)
and served with 200 ml of water.

A measure of ‘available carbohydrates’ in barley
and oat tempe was obtained as total carbohydrate by
difference, minus dietary ﬁbre, analysed using AOAC
methods [2]. Based on this estimate in accordance
with the recommended procedure for GI determina-
tion [9], portion sizes of 95 g barley tempe and 111 g
oat tempe, were calculated to provide 25 g ‘available
carbohydrates’ (Table 1). As a reference a glucose
solution was used. The glucose solution was prepared
from pure glucose (Apoteket AB Production & Lab-
oratories, Sweden) and water. Water-free glucose
(25 g) was dissolved in 200 ml water and stored in
refrigerator until use (within 3 days).

j Subjects

Healthy adult, men and women aged 20–75 years were
recruited from the Uppsala region by newspaper
advertisements. Before entering the study the subjects
blood glucose, Hb, ASAT, ALAT, creatinin and TSH
status were assessed by standard laboratory tests per-
formed at Uppsala University Hospital, Akademiska
sjukhuset, Uppsala, Sweden. The subjects had to meet
the following criteria: (1) absence of any disease (2) Age

Table 2 Characteristics of the subjects at the time of entry into the study

20–75; (3) body mass index ‡20 to £31 kg/m2; (4) fasting
serum glucose £6.0 mmol/l; (5) Hb ‡120 g/l for women
and ‡130 g/l for men; (6) signed informed consent.

In all, 24 persons were deemed eligible to partici-
pate in a screening visit based on their response to a
brief medical history interview. Of these, 16 met the
trial eligibility criteria after the screening visit. Of this
group, 13 subjects (9 women, 4 men) participated in
the study. Physical and biochemical characteristics of
the participants are shown in Table 2. The experi-
mental protocol was approved by the Ethical Com-
mittee of the Medical Faculty at Uppsala University.

j Experimental design

Glycaemic and insulinaemic responses were determined
for barley and oat tempe using glucose solution as ref-
erence. The volunteers were randomly assigned to start
with one of the two different tempe products. The sub-
ject randomisation order was made according to ‘block
scaling’: each week three subjects consumed barley or
oat tempe while the rest of the subjects ingested glucose
solution. The subjects were served the test meals on two
separate occasions and the glucose solution on three
separate occasions, at the same time in the morning
after an overnight fast. The meals were eaten within
15 min. Blood samples were taken before the meal and
at 15, 30, 45, 60, 90 and 120 min for analysis of glucose.
Blood glucose concentrations were determined directly
in ﬁnger-prick capillary blood collected from the sub-
jects by the glucose-dehydrogenase-based reaction
using HemoCue blood glucose photometer (HemoCue
AB). Serum insulin concentrations were measured with
an electrochemical luminescence immunoassay (Mod-
ular E170, RocheA/G) in venous blood.

j Calculations and statistical analyses

For each subject and test meal, the glucose and insulin
areas under the curves were calculated. All areas be-

barley and oat tempe meals were signiﬁcantly lower
than after the glucose load (P < 0.0001) at 15, 30, 45 and
60 min, and the two tempe meals exerted signiﬁcantly
different responses (P < 0.002) at 45, 60, 90 and
120 min. At 45 and 60 min the responses from barley
tempe, oat tempe and glucose load were all signiﬁcantly
different (P < 0.002) from each other. In addition, both
barley and oat tempe curves showed no obvious peaks,
while the glucose load curve peaked at 45 min.

Serum insulin concentrations are shown in Fig. 2.
The serum insulin levels of barley and oat tempe were
signiﬁcantly lower (P < 0.002) at 15, 30, 45, and
60 min than after the glucose load. The two tempe
meals had signiﬁcantly different responses (P < 0.02)
at 45, 60 and 90 min with the lowest insulin response
observed after consumption of the oat tempe meal. At
45 and 60 min, serum insulin responses from the two
meals and the glucose load collections were signiﬁ-
cantly different (P < 0.02) from each other.

The GI, calculations were based on data from 13
subjects while the II calculations were based on 10
subjects for barley tempe and nine subjects for the oat
tempe. All data from three subjects were excluded
because of haemolysis and from one subject due to
difﬁculties to collect blood.

The glucose AUCs (Table 3) of the barley tempe
and oat tempe were signiﬁcantly lower than the AUC
for the reference glucose load (Ref/Oat P < 0.0001,
Ref/Barley P < 0.0001, Barley/Oat P < 0.0001). The
insulin AUCs of both the barley and oat tempe dif-
fered signiﬁcantly from that of the glucose reference
(Ref/Oat P < 0.0002, Ref/Barley P < 0.0001, Barley/
Oat P < 0.004). The calculated GI:s for the barley and
oat tempe were 30 ± 5 and 63 ± 6, respectively, while
the calculated II was lower for oat tempe (21 ± 6)
compared to barley tempe (55 ± 4).

Discussion

The present study shows that consumption of fer-
mented whole-grain barley or oat with high amylose

298

and/or b-glucan content can improve the glucose and
insulin responses of healthy subjects. Glucose and
insulin levels after consumption of barley tempe and
oat tempe were signiﬁcantly lower than those after the
glucose load, and the glucose areas under the curve
(AUCs) from 45 to 120 min was signiﬁcantly lower for
the high-amylose barley tempe compared to the oat
tempe (Fig. 1). Improvement in glycemic response
after foods containing high-amylose starch or resis-
tant starch has also been reported in previous studies
[3, 11]. Meals containing high-amylose cornstarch
(70–75% amylose) have been shown to reduce post-
prandial glucose and insulin responses. Hydrolysis of
amylose has been suggested to result in fewer glucose
molecules being liberated at once than during
hydrolysis of the highly branched amylopectin chains
[15]. According to Behall and Hallfrisch [3],
the
amylose content of the starch needs to be >50% to
signiﬁcantly reduce plasma glucose and insulin.

However, high-amylose starches are also thought
to be less digestible than standard starches containing
lower amounts of amylose due to the presence or
development of resistant starch. In a recent study by
Behall et al. [5], signiﬁcant reduction of glucose and
insulin responses was observed after the consumption
of meals with different levels of resistant starch from
high-amylose cornstarch. In addition, the reduction
in glycemic response was enhanced by combining
resistant starch and b-glucan. Behall et al. [5] con-
cluded that soluble ﬁbre appears to have a greater
effect on postprandial insulin response while glucose
reduction was greater after intake of resistant starch
from high-amylose corn starch. These observations
are in agreement with our ﬁndings; where the
AUCinsulin after consumption of the high-b-glucan oat
tempe meal was lower than the AUCinsulin from high-
amylose barley tempe meal (Fig. 2). Furthermore, the
glucose response was signiﬁcantly lower from the
high-amylose barley tempe meal compared to the
high-b-glucan oat tempe meal. In the study by Behall
et al. [5] the b-glucan intake averaged 0.3, 0.9 or 3.7 g
in three different meals. In the present study, the total
b-glucan content was 2.0 g (barley tempe) and 2.2 g
(oat tempe). Hence, one would expect the insulin re-
sponse from barley tempe to be as low as from oat
tempe due to almost similar b-glucan content. How-
ever, Granfeldt et al. [12] reported that, in healthy
subjects,
less insulin is needed for the control of
postprandial glucose excursions after the consump-
tion of oat products than after barley products. In
their study on rolled oats and barley, a high glucose
and insulin response from thick barley ﬂakes was
observed, in contrast to the corresponding oat ﬂakes
which had a lower insulin index [12]. This was also
indicated in a report by Juntunen et al. [20], who
studied postprandial glucose and insulin responses to

grain products in healthy subjects. Their data sug-
gested that the form of food and botanical structure
rather than the amount of ﬁbre or type of cereal
determines the postprandial insulin response. How-
ever, Heaton et al. [16] compared particle size of
wheat, maize and oat meals and the consequential
effects on glucose and insulin responses. They found
that oat-based meals evoked smaller glucose and
insulin responses than wheat- or maize-based meals
and that particle size of wheat and maize, but not oats,
inﬂuenced the digestion rate. With oats the in vitro
digestion rate was found to increase as the particle
size decreased, however, in vivo the plasma glucose
and insulin responses were not signiﬁcantly different
between three oat-based meals of different particle
size. It was suggested that this difference between
wheat, maize and oats might be explained by the
viscous properties of the soluble b-glucans in oats,
limiting the digestion or absorption in vivo. Numer-
ous other studies have reported inverse relationships
between b-glucan content and glucose and/or insulin
responses [17, 29, 31] and the suggested mechanisms
include viscosity of the soluble ﬁbres resulting in
delayed or reduced carbohydrate absorption from the
gut.

Evidence from in vitro studies suggests that dietary
ﬁbre can alter the activity of pancreatic amylase [7].
The inhibitory effects of ﬁbre on pancreatic enzyme
activities have been attributed to various factors
including pH changes, ion-exchange properties, en-
zyme inhibitors and adsorption. Rather
than a
chemical enzyme-ﬁbre interaction, the presence of
ﬁbre, through its particulate or viscous nature, has
also been suggested to impede enzyme-substrate
interactions [9]. Further, the presence of ﬁbre in a
form that restricts starch gelatinization or access of
the hydrolytic enzymes to starch can slow the rate of
starch digestion. In addition, resistance of starch
to pancreatic hydrolysis may result from the presence
of
cell walls, which survive processing
and cooking and insulates starch in a manner
that partly obstructs digestion and absorption. The
factors responsible for the lowered insulin response
after consumption of oat tempe compared to barley
tempe are not completely evident. However,
the
structures of the continuous matrix and starch gran-
ules probably differ between barley and oats and
could in part explain the lower insulinemic response
from oat tempe.

intact

It has also been observed that bread containing
lactic acid produced during sourdough fermentation
or added directly, has the ability to lower the post-
prandial glucose and insulin responses in humans
[32]. Thus, the preparation of cereal tempe from
whole kernels soaked in lactic acid is probably an
important part of the observed effects on postprandial

M. Alminger and C. Eklund-Jonsson

plasma glucose and insulin responses in the present
study. Furthermore, grains contain components like
phytic acid,
lectins, phenolic compounds, amylase
inhibitors and saponins. These compounds have been
found to lower one or more of the following sub-
stances in plasma: glucose, insulin, cholesterol and
triacylglycerol [6, 27].

Fibre-rich, whole-grain foods may indeed have
many overlapping physiologic effects and, the physi-
cal form and high ﬁbre content of whole-grain tempe
as well as presence of organic acids, appear to work
synergistically to affect digestion and absorption of
carbohydrates. Therefore, the metabolic beneﬁts of
using whole grains, fermentation and cereal geno-
types with elevated contents of amylose or b-glucans

are evident. Also, the tailoring of whole-grain prod-
ucts offer a particular challenge since palatable and
effective high-ﬁbre products could play an important
part in increasing whole-grain intakes and reducing
the risk for development of illnesses such as type II
diabetes and cardiovascular disease.

In conclusion, the results suggest that tempe fer-
mentation of whole-grain barley and oats is a possible
means to obtain healthy foods with low GI and II.

IMPORTANCE Red meat consumption has been consistently associated with an increased risk
of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, whether changes in red meat intake are related
to subsequent T2DM risk remains unknown.

OBJECTIVE To evaluate the association between changes in red meat consumption during a
4-year period and subsequent 4-year risk of T2DM in US adults.

DESIGN AND SETTING Three prospective cohort studies in US men and women.

PARTICIPANTS We followed up 26 357 men in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study
(1986-2006), 48 709 women in the Nurses’ Health Study (1986-2006), and 74 077 women
in the Nurses’ Health Study II (1991-2007). Diet was assessed by validated food frequency
questionnaires and updated every 4 years. Time-dependent Cox proportional hazards
regression models were used to calculate hazard ratios with adjustment for age, family
history, race, marital status, initial red meat consumption, smoking status, and initial and
changes in other lifestyle factors (physical activity, alcohol intake, total energy intake, and diet
quality). Results across cohorts were pooled by an inverse variance–weighted, fixed-effect
meta-analysis.

MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Incident T2DM cases validated by supplementary
questionnaires.

RESULTS During 1 965 824 person-years of follow-up, we documented 7540 incident T2DM
cases. In the multivariate-adjusted models, increasing red meat intake during a 4-year interval
was associated with an elevated risk of T2DM during the subsequent 4 years in each cohort
(all P < .001 for trend). Compared with the reference group of no change in red meat intake,
increasing red meat intake of more than 0.50 servings per day was associated with a 48%
(pooled hazard ratio, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.37-1.59) elevated risk in the subsequent 4-year period,
and the association was modestly attenuated after further adjustment for initial body mass
index and concurrent weight gain (1.30; 95% CI, 1.21-1.41). Reducing red meat consumption
by more than 0.50 servings per day from baseline to the first 4 years of follow-up was
associated with a 14% (pooled hazard ratio, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.80-0.93) lower risk during the
subsequent entire follow-up through 2006 or 2007.

CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Increasing red meat consumption over time is associated with
an elevated subsequent risk of T2DM, and the association is partly mediated by body weight.
Our results add further evidence that limiting red meat consumption over time confers
benefits for T2DM prevention.

Original Investigation Research

R edmeatconsumptionhasbeenconsistentlyrelatedtoan

elevated risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). For ex-
ample, 3 recent meta-analyses1-3 of prospective cohort
studies reported positive associations. However, most previ-
ous studies measured red meat consumption only at baseline
with limited follow-up information. In real life, a person’s eat-
ing behavior changes over time, and secular trends in red meat
intake are also changing dramatically across the globe.4 Be-
causeameasurementatasingletimepointdoesnotcapturethe
variability of red meat intake during follow-up, it is important
to evaluate whether changes in red meat intake over time alter
the risk of developing T2DM. Therefore, we analyzed data from
3 Harvard cohort studies: the Health Professionals Follow-up
Study (HPFS), the Nurses’ Health Study (NHS), and the Nurses’
Health Study II (NHS II), in which we collected repeated mea-
surements of red meat intake every 4 years, as well as other di-
etarycomponents,lifestylefactors,andmedicalhistorywithup
to 20 years of follow-up. These repeated measures and long du-
ration of follow-up allow us to investigate the association be-
tween dynamic changes in red meat intake and subsequent risk
of T2DM. We conducted 2 sets of change analysis. In the first
analysis, we examined 4-year change in red meat intake in re-
lation to T2DM incidence in the next 4 years of follow-up. In the
secondanalysis,toexaminelong-termeffectsofmeatintakeon
T2DM,weanalyzedchangesinredmeatintakefrombaselineto
the first 4-year follow-up with T2DM incidence in the subse-
quent 12 (NHS II) and 16 (NHS and HPFS) years of follow-up.

Methods
Study Population
TheHPFSwasinitiatedin1986when51 529USmalehealthpro-
fessionals, aged 40 to 75 years, returned a baseline question-
naire about detailed medical history, as well as lifestyle and
usual diet. The NHS consists of 121 700 registered female
nurses, aged 30 to 55 years, who completed a baseline ques-
tionnaire about lifestyle and medical history in 1976. The NHS
II, established in 1989, comprises 116 671 younger female reg-
istered nurses, aged 25 to 42 years, who responded to a base-
line questionnaire similar to that of the NHS. Detailed descrip-
tions of the cohorts have been introduced elsewhere.3,5 In all
cohorts, questionnaires were administered at baseline and bi-
ennially thereafter to collect and update information on life-
style practices (eg, smoking and physical activity) and the oc-
currence of new-onset diseases. The cumulative follow-up of
the 3 cohorts exceeds 90% of potential person-times.

In the current analysis, we used 1986 for the HPFS and NHS
and 1991 for the NHS II as the baseline when we assessed de-
tailedinformationondietandlifestylefactors.Becauseweused
the changes in red meat consumption every 4 years as the ex-
posure to predict the subsequent 4-year T2DM risk, we ex-
cluded men and women who had a history of diabetes melli-
tus (including type 1 diabetes mellitus, T2DM, and gestational
diabetes), cardiovascular disease, or cancer 4 years after base-
line (ie, 1990 for the HPFS and NHS and 1995 for the NHS II).
In addition, we excluded participants who left more than 10
blank food items on the baseline food frequency question-

naire (FFQ), reported unusual total energy intake levels (ie,
<800 or >4200 kcal/d for men and <500 or >3500 kcal/d for
women), or did not report meat consumption. After exclu-
sions, data from 26 357 HPFS men, 48 709 NHS women, and
74 077 NHS II women were available. Participants who were
excluded because of missing baseline FFQ data were similar
in age and body mass index (BMI) compared with those in-
cludedintheanalysis(datanotshown).Thestudyprotocolwas
approved by the institutional review boards of Brigham and
Women’s Hospital and the Harvard School of Public Health.

Assessment of Meat Consumption
Dietary information, collected by a validated FFQ in 1986 for
the HPFS and NHS and in 1991 for the NHS II, was updated ev-
ery 4 years with similar FFQs. In all FFQs, we asked partici-
pants how often, on average, they consumed each food of a
standard portion size. Frequency responses ranged from never
or less than once per month to 6 or more times per day. Ques-
tionnaire items on unprocessed red meat (85 g or 3 oz) in-
cluded beef, pork, or lamb as main dish; hamburger; and beef,
pork, or lamb as a sandwich or mixed dish. Items on pro-
cessed red meat included bacon (2 slices, 13 g), hot dogs (1 hot
dog, 45 g), and sausage, salami, bologna, and other processed
red meats (1 piece, 28 g). The reproducibility and validity of
FFQs have been demonstrated in detail elsewhere.6-8 Corre-
lation coefficients between FFQs and multiple diet records
ranged from 0.38 to 0.70 for various red meat items.7

Assessment of Covariates
Inthefollow-upquestionnaires,weobtainedupdatedinforma-
tion on risk factors for T2DM, such as body weight, cigarette
smoking,physicalactivity,andahistoryofhypertensionandhy-
percholesterolemia.Wealsoascertainedmenopausalstatusand
postmenopausal hormone use in women. Alcohol intake was
asked on the FFQ and updated every 4 years. We also collected
information on a family history of T2DM, race, and marital sta-
tus.Toassessoveralldietquality,wecalculatedadietscorebased
on the 2010 Alternative Healthy Eating Index,9 which was de-
signed to reflect food choices and nutrients associated with re-
duced noncommunicable disease risk. For the current analy-
sis, we constructed the Alternative Healthy Eating Index score
without the meat and alcohol components because they were
included separately in the models.

Assessment of T2DM
Incident T2DM cases were identified by self-report on the main
questionnaires every 2 years and confirmed by a validated
supplementary questionnaire regarding symptoms, diagnostic
tests, and treatment. The diagnosis was confirmed if at least 1
of the following was reported according to the National Diabe-
tes Data Group10 criteria: (1) 1 or more classic symptoms (exces-
sive thirst, polyuria, weight loss, or hunger) plus fasting glu-
cose levels 140 mg/dL or higher or random glucose levels 200
mg/dL or higher (to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by
0.0555), (2) at least 2 elevated glucose concentrations on differ-
ent occasions (fasting glucose levels ≥140 mg/dL, random glu-
cose levels ≥200 mg/dL, and/or concentrations ≥200 mg/dL af-
ter 2 hours or more by oral glucose tolerance testing) in the

cation (insulin or oral hypoglycemic agent). For cases diag-
nosed in 1998 and later, the fasting glucose threshold was low-
ered to 126 mg/dL according to the American Diabetes
Association11 criteria.

The validity of the supplementary questionnaire for the di-
agnosis of T2DM has been documented previously: of 59 cases
in the HPFS and 62 cases in the NHS confirmed by supplemen-
tary questionnaires, 57 (97%) and 61 (98%) cases, respectively,
were reconfirmed by medical records.12,13 In another substudy

endar time, we simultaneously controlled for various potential

history of T2DM (yes or no), marital status (with spouse, yes or
no; updated every 4 years), history of hypertension and hyper-

pausalstatusandmenopausalhormoneuse.Ithasbeenreported
thatincreasingredmeatconsumptionwasrelatedtoweightgain
in the 3 cohorts5; therefore, body weight and weight gain could
be mediators. We adjusted for initial BMI (calculated as weight

25-29.9,30-34.9,and≥35)andchangesinbodyweight(quintiles)

model. We also analyzed processed and unprocessed red meat
separately.

In the second analysis, to examine long-term effects of red
meatintakeonT2DM,weanalyzedchangesinintakefrombase-
linetothefirst4-yearfollow-upandT2DMincidenceinthesub-
sequent follow-up years. Specifically, we used changes in red
meatconsumptionbetween1986and1990topredictT2DMrisk
from 1990 through 2006 for the NHS and HPFS, as well as be-
tween1991and1995topredictT2DMriskfrom1995through2007
for the NHS II.

To minimize missing values during follow-up, we replaced
them with carried-forward values for continuous variables and
added a missing indicator for categorical variables. Stratified
analyseswereperformedaprioribyinitialBMIcategories(<30.0
and ≥30.0), and the interaction was tested by including cross-
product terms in the models. An inverse variance–weighted,
fixed-effectmeta-analysiswasusedtocombinetheresultsacross
cohorts because no significant heterogeneity was found.

We conducted a series of sensitivity analyses to test the
robustness of our results: we stopped updating the dietary in-
formation after self-report of incident cardiovascular disease
or cancer during the follow-up, censored participants when
theydidnotanswerFFQsduringthefollow-up,andusedamul-
tiple imputation procedure with 20 rounds of imputation and
included all covariates to account for missing dietary and co-
variate data. All analyses were performed using SAS soft-
ware, version 9.2 (SAS Institute), at a 2-tailed P value of .05.

Results
We documented 7540 incident T2DM cases during the fol-
low-up (1561 in the HPFS, 3482 in the NHS, and 2497 in the NHS
II). Table 1 describes the distribution of baseline characteris-
tics according to change in total red meat consumption. Com-
paredwithpeoplewithrelativelystableintake,individualswho
decreasedorincreasedtheirintakeweregenerallyyounger,had
higherBMIlevels,hadalowerdietqualityscore,andweremore
likelytobesmokers.Thosewhodecreasedintakewerealsomore
likely to report a diagnosis of hypertension or hypercholester-
olemia. As expected, increasing red meat intake was related to
concurrentweightgain,increasesintotalenergyintake,andde-
creases in diet quality scores, while the associations with de-
creasing red meat intake were in the opposite direction.

Table 2 shows the HRs of T2DM according to changes in
totalredmeatconsumption.Comparedwithindividualswhose
intake remained relatively stable in each 4-year period, those
who increased their red meat intake were at elevated risks
(P < .001 in all 3 cohorts): increasing red meat intake of more
than 0.50 servings per day was associated with a 48% (pooled
HR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.37-1.59) elevated risk in the subsequent
4-year period, and the association was modestly attenuated
after further adjustment for initial BMI and concurrent weight
gain (pooled HR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.21-1.41). A moderate increase
(0.15-0.50 servings per day) in red meat intake was also asso-
ciated with an elevated risk: the corresponding pooled HRs
were 1.21 (95% CI, 1.13-1.30) and 1.15 (95% CI, 1.07-1.23) before
andafteradjustmentforinitialBMIandconcurrentweightgain,
respectively. The associations were greater for processed than
for unprocessed red meat (eTable 1 in Supplement).

No significant decreased T2DM risk was found with a re-
duction of red meat intake within a 4-year period (Table 2).
However, when we used reduction in red meat consumption
from baseline to the first 4-year follow-up as the exposure to
predict future risk of T2DM during the entire follow-up (in-
stead of just the subsequent 4 years), we observed that a re-
duction of red meat intake of more than 0.50 servings per day
was associated with a 14% (pooled HR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.80-

TheFigureandeTable2(inSupplement)showresultsbased
on the initial and subsequent 4-year intake of red meat. Com-
pared with stable low-level consumers (<2 servings per week;
reference group), individuals who increased their red meat in-
take from low to high levels had an almost 2-fold risk (pooled
HR, 1.99; 95% CI, 1.53-2.58). The pooled HR was 1.37 (95% CI,
1.22-1.53)forstable,moderate-levelconsumers;roseto1.87(1.65-
2.12)forthosewhoincreasedtheirintakefrommoderatetohigh
levels; and decreased to 1.19 (1.02-1.38) in individuals who re-
ducedtheirintakefrommoderatetolowlevels.Comparedwith
the reference group, the pooled HR was 2.10 (95% CI, 1.87-2.37)

to moderate or low levels 4 years later, respectively. All esti-
mateswereattenuatedafteradjustmentforinitialBMIandcon-
current weight changes (eTable 2 in Supplement).

We observed a significant interaction between initial BMI
and changes in red meat intake in relation to the risk of T2DM
(eTable 3 in Supplement). Compared with stable consump-
tion, increasing intake of more than 0.50 servings per day
within a 4-year period was associated with a 65% (pooled HR,
1.65; 95% CI, 1.48-1.84) elevated risk of developing T2DM in
the subsequent 4-year interval among nonobese individuals,

while the corresponding pooled HR was 1.14 (95% CI, 1.02-
1.27) among obese individuals.

Discussion
In these 3 large prospective cohorts of US men and women,
4-year increases in red meat consumption were positively as-
sociated with subsequent 4-year risk of T2DM, independent
of initial red meat intake and changes in other lifestyle fac-
tors, including overall diet quality and body weight. This as-
sociation was observed for unprocessed and processed red
meat. Decreasing red meat intake was not associated with an
acute but rather a prolonged reduced risk of T2DM.

a Data are based on 20 years of follow-up (1986-2006) in the HPFS, 20 years of
follow-up (1986-2006) in the NHS, and 16 years of follow-up (1991-2007) in
the NHS II. The exposure was change in red meat intake in each 4-year period,
and the outcome was the incidence of T2DM in the subsequent 4 years.
b Values are presented as hazard ratios (95% CI) unless noted otherwise.
c P value for trend was derived from tests of linear trend across categories of
changes in red meat consumption by treating the median value of each
category as a continuous variable.
d Adjusted for age, initial red meat intake (quintiles), race (white or nonwhite),
marital status (with spouse, yes or no), family history of T2DM (yes or no),

history of hypertension (yes or no), history of hypercholesterolemia (yes or
no), and simultaneous changes in other lifestyle factors: smoking status (never
to never, never to current, past to past, past to current, current to past,
current to current, or missing indicator) and initial and changes (all in quintiles)
in alcohol intake, physical activity, total energy intake, and diet quality
(Alternative Healthy Eating Index). In the NHS and NHS II, postmenopausal
status and menopausal hormone use were also included.
e Model 1 plus initial body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided
by height in meters squared) (<23, 23-24.9, 25-29.9, 30-34.9, and ⱖ35) and
weight change (quintiles) during the 4-year period.
f The results across the 3 cohorts were pooled using an inverse
variance–weighted, fixed-effect meta-analysis.

Three meta-analyses of prospective cohort studies have re-
ported a positive association between red meat intake and
T2DM.1-3 However, most previous studies evaluated the rela-
tionshipbetweenmeatintakeatbaselineandT2DMriskwithlim-
ited information during follow-up. Because individuals’ eating
behaviors may change over time,4 a single time measurement
maynotcapturethevariabilityofredmeatintakeduringfollow-
up. To our knowledge, this study is the first to investigate the
association between changes in red meat intake and subse-
quent T2DM risk. Our results are largely consistent with previ-
ousreportsbutextendthefindingstosuggestthatincreasingred
meat intake is followed by an elevated risk of T2DM in a short-
term (4 years) and long-term (12-16 years) period.

Our previous analysis3 in the 3 cohorts found that red meat
intake was associated with an increased risk of T2DM. How-
ever, that analysis did not consider changes in red meat in-
take. An important finding from our analysis is that both ini-
tial (data not shown, but results were similar to our previous
study3) and changes in red meat intake were independently
related to an elevated risk of T2DM. Joint analysis of initial and
subsequent 4-year intake of red meat confirmed that consis-
tent high intake was related to a greater risk of T2DM com-
pared with a consistent low level, and this risk rose quickly and
substantially (almost 2-fold) when increasing intake from low
to high levels. Changing from high to low levels did not com-

pletely mitigate the increased risk within 4 years for people
with initial high red meat intake; however, the analysis of
change during the first 4 years in relation to T2DM during the
entire follow-up period suggests that reducing red meat in-
take still has a long-term benefit. The absence of a short-term
reduction in the risk of T2DM may be the result of higher-risk
patients (those with lipid disorders, hypertension, or other car-
diometabolic risk factors) being most likely to be counseled by
their health care providers to reduce red meat consumption.
In the current study, adjustment for BMI modestly attenu-
ated the association between red meat intake and T2DM risk,
which suggests that it may be partly mediated through obesity
andweightgain.Inthe3Harvardcohorts5 andalargeEuropean
cohort,15 red meat intake was positively associated with future
riskofweightgain.Furthermore,weobservedasignificantinter-
action with initial BMI, and the association was much stronger
amongnonobesecomparedwithobesepeople.Thisisconsistent
withtherecentEPIC-InterActstudyinEuropeanpopulations,16
althoughthatstudyusedonlybaselineinformation.Itispossible
thatobeseindividualsarealreadyatahighriskofT2DMbecause
of their body weight and higher initial red meat intake (data not
shown),andincreasingredmeatintakehasonlyamodestlydel-
eterious effect on the relative scale. However, the absolute risk

Low intake level was defined as less than 2 servings per week; moderate intake, 2 to

group (hazard ratio, 1.00) was the low intake level at both the initial and the 4-year
follow-up visits. The results across the 3 cohorts were pooled using an inverse
variance–weighted, fixed-effect meta-analysis. See the Statistical Analysis section
for an explanation of the analysis.

Since our study is observational in nature, causality cannot
be inferred. Randomized clinical trials may better address the
causalrelationshipbetweenredmeatandT2DMbutmaynotbe
feasible. Our “change-to-risk” analysis capitalizes on repeated
measurementsandlong-termfollow-up.Ouranalysisapproach
is, to some extent, a natural experiment, in which individuals
choose to change their diet and lifestyles without investigator-

initiated interventions, and thus the results may be more exter-
nally generalizable to the real world compared with a well-
controlledlaboratorysetting.Wedonotknowtheunderlyingrea-

changes in multiple diet and lifestyle factors, and the previous
analysis5 suggested a modest correlation among changes in dif-
ferentdietaryandbehavioralfactors.However,residualandun-
measured confounding from other lifestyle behaviors is still
possible.

In conclusion, in these 3 cohorts of US adults, increases in
red meat intake within a 4-year period were associated with a

higher risk of T2DM in the subsequent 4-year interval. In ad-
dition, a reduction in red meat intake was associated with a
lowerincidenceofT2DMduringasubsequentlong-termfollow-
up. Our results confirm the robustness of the association be-
tween red meat and T2DM and add further evidence that lim-
iting red meat consumption over time confers benefits for
T2DM prevention.

Abstract Growing evidence suggests that effects of red meat
consumption on coronary heart disease (CHD) and type 2
diabetes could vary depending on processing. We reviewed
the evidence for effects of unprocessed (fresh/frozen) red and
processed (using sodium/other preservatives) meat consump-
tion on CHD and diabetes. In meta-analyses of prospective
cohorts, higher risk of CHD is seen with processed meat
consumption (RR per 50 g: 1.42, 95 %CI01.07–1.89), but
much lower or no risk is seen with unprocessed meat con-
sumption. Differences in sodium content (~400 % higher in
processed meat) appear to account for about two-thirds of this
risk difference. In similar analyses, both unprocessed red and
processed meat consumption are associated with incident
diabetes, with much higher risk per g of processed (RR per

100 g: 1.19, 95 % CI01.04–1.37) meats. Contents of heme
iron and dietary cholesterol may partly account for these associ-
ations. The overall findings suggest that neither unprocessed red
nor processed meat consumption is beneficial for cardiometa-
bolic health, and that clinical and public health guidance should
especially prioritize reducing processed meat consumption.

Introduction

Red meat consumption is considered a major dietary risk
factor for cardiometabolic diseases, including coronary heart
disease (CHD) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM). In a 2010
meta-analysis, we provided evidence that relationships of
meat consumption with development of these conditions
might vary depending on the extent of processing [1(cid:129)(cid:129)],
i.e., whether or not the meat is unprocessed (e.g., fresh or
frozen) or has been processed and preserved for long-term
storage, e.g., by adding high amounts of salt and/or other
preservatives such as nitrates. Since the publication of our
findings, several additional studies have evaluated how eat-
ing unprocessed red meats or processed meats relates to
development of CHD and DM. Understanding potential
differences in the associations of these different types of
meats with disease outcomes, as well as the magnitude and
dose-response of such effects, is relevant for elucidating the
potentially relevant harmful constituents and for informing
priorities for clinical and public health dietary guidance.

In this report, we review the current evidence for effects of
unprocessed red and processed meat consumption on CHD
and DM. Relevant issues considered herein include: (1) the
characterizations and definitions of the type of meat consumed,

516

Curr Atheroscler Rep (2012) 14:515–524

(2) the evidence for effects on clinical endpoints, including the
magnitudes and dose-responses of effect, (3) the potential
mechanisms for similar or differing associations of different
meat types with various cardiometabolic diseases, (4) the
potential for bias in the evidence, and (5) the implications of
the evidence for clinical and public health priorities.

Categorizations of Meat Consumption

For understanding relations with disease endpoints, foods
are often investigated in broad groupings, such as total
meats, vegetables, fruits, fish, nuts, and so on. Such catego-
ries are helpful to group together similar foods when they
have similar potential health effects, but can provide incom-
plete or misleading information when foods with differing
health effects are combined into a single group. For exam-
ple, whereas fish consumption is typically considered as a
single category, we and others have shown that consumption
of fatty or oily fish, which are highest in omega 3 s, is most
strongly associated with lower CHD mortality, whereas
consumption of fried fish or fish sandwiches, which are
typically low in omega-3 s and can be commercially fried
in unhealthy oils, are not [2]. Similarly, there are potentially
important nutritional differences in different types of meat,
including the contents of calories, specific fats, iron, or
preservatives such as sodium or nitrites. Different cooking
methods (e.g., broiling, baking, grilling, frying) could also
likely alter health effects—for example, charring and black-
ening of meats introduces products such as heterocyclic
amines and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons that likely
increase cancer risk [3]—but the effects of cooking methods
on cardiometabolic risk have thus far been studied much
less and will not be considered further in the present review.
Based on fat, cholesterol, and iron contents, meats are often
broadly categorized into red (e.g., beef, pork, lamb) or white
(e.g., chicken, turkey, rabbit) meats. Each of these types of
meat can also be either preserved, typically by the addition of
high levels of salt and/or chemical preservatives (referred to
hereafter as “processed meat”), or consumed without such
preservatives (referred to hereafter as “unprocessed meat”).
Additional potential categories could include offal meat (i.e.,
organ meat) or non-domesticated meat (i.e., game).

Considering these different major groupings and possible
sub-groupings, it becomes evident that many differing defini-
tions and categorizations of meats could be considered. As
discussed below, no randomized controlled trials (RCTs)
focusing on meat consumption and any chronic disease out-
come have been performed. Furthermore, interpretation of any
such RCT would be limited by the lack of blinding, by non-
compliance, and by cross-over over time. Consequently, pro-
spective observational studies provide the most robust
available evidence for understanding the effects of meat

consumption on the development of chronic diseases.
Because such studies must be very large and follow partic-
ipants for many years, the dietary assessment methods in such
studies generally do not permit reliable quantification of every
possible subtype of meat. Rather, the most reliable groupings
of types of meat that have been considered in such studies,
which we will review herein, are of total unprocessed red meat
consumption, including beef, pork, and lamb; and total pro-
cessed meat consumption, including bacon, hot dogs, sausage,
salami, and processed deli or luncheon meats.

Evaluating Effects of Meat Consumption
on Cardiometabolic Health

Dietary habits can affect a wide range of intermediate biologic
pathways, including blood cholesterol concentrations, lipo-
protein levels, blood pressure, insulin resistance, endothelial
function, inflammation, adiposity, arrhythmic risk, and myo-
cardial function and efficiency [4]. Consequently, effects of
dietary habits on any one or even several of these surrogate
outcomes are often insufficient for making strong inference
about effects on clinical endpoints. An Institute of Medicine
report on the use of biomarkers and similar surrogate markers
concluded that the evidence does not support using such
markers, including LDL cholesterol levels, as a surrogate
endpoint for the effects of dietary habits on clinical events [5].
Several authors and organizations have proposed compre-
hensive methods for evaluating effects of dietary habits on
chronic disease endpoints [6–9]. These methods each high-
light the primacy of evidence derived from studies of clinical
endpoints rather than surrogate markers. Dietary habits and
chronic disease endpoints can be studied in well-conducted
RCTs or well-conducted, large prospective cohort studies,
with further careful pooling of such findings in systematic
reviews and meta-analyses to derive the best available evi-
dence from all studies worldwide. Similar to most other life-
style risk factors (e.g., smoking, physical activity, obesity,
consumption of salt, dietary cholesterol, fruits, vegetables,
nuts, whole grains), the effects of meat consumption on car-
diometabolic endpoints have not, to our knowledge, been
investigated in any RCTs. This is unsurprising given practical,
ethical, and cost considerations, as well as inherent methodo-
logical limitations, such as the inability to perform blinding
and inevitable noncompliance and cross-over during the long
periods of time required to detect effects on chronic disease.
Thus, prospective cohort studies provide the best available
evidence to estimate causal effects of meat consumption on
cardiometabolic events, with consideration of evidence for
temporality, consistency, magnitude, and dose-response, as
well as support from studies of biomarkers and surrogate
markers to provide plausible biologic mechanisms [6–9]. We
review this evidence below.

Coronary Heart Disease

In a 2010 systematic review and meta-analysis [1(cid:129)(cid:129)], we
separately evaluated the associations of unprocessed red
and processed meats with the development of cardiometa-
bolic events. For comparability across studies, all reported
RR’s were standardized to 100 g serving sizes for unpro-
cessed red meats and 50 g serving sizes for processed meats.
To minimize potential bias, particular efforts were made to
extract or directly obtain from the authors the risk estimates
with the greatest control for potential confounders, and
crude risk estimates were excluded a priori. Whenever pos-
sible, the multivariable model was selected that did not
include variables that could be potential intermediates in
the causal pathway (e.g., blood cholesterol concentrations).
We identified a total of three prospective cohort studies and
one case-control study that evaluated the relationship between
unprocessed red meat consumption and incident CHD [10–13].
The pooled dose-response, including 56,311 participants and
769 events, found no significant association between unpro-
cessed red meat consumption and CHD risk (RR01.00 per
100 g serving/day, 95 % CI00.81–1.23) (Fig. 1). Pooled find-
ings restricted to prospective cohorts [10–12] were similar to
the overall pooled estimate (RR00.92, 95 % CI00.74–1.15).
We identified six observational studies including 614,062
participants and 21,308 events [1(cid:129)(cid:129)] that evaluated processed

517

meat consumption and incident CHD [10, 12–15]. In pooled
analyses, each 50 g serving/day of processed meats was
associated with 42 % higher risk (RR01.42, 95 % CI01.07–
1.89) (Fig. 1). This stonger association was seen despite the
smaller serving size (50 g) compared with unprocessed red
meats (100 g). Matching the serving sizes, each 100 g serving/
day of processed meats was associated with 2-fold higher risk
of CHD (RR02.02, 95 % CI01.14–3.57). When the analysis
was restricted to prospective cohorts [10, 12, 14, 15], similar
findings were observed, with 44 % higher CHD risk per 50 g
serving/day (RR01.44, 95 % CI01.07–1.95). Of note, in
many of these studies, processed hot dogs and deli meats,
which would include processed poultry meats (chicken,
turkey), were included in total processed meats but were not
separately assessed.

Following publication of these findings, two large studies
have evaluated the associations between eating unprocessed
red meat and risk of incident CHD [16(cid:129)] and CVD mortality
[17(cid:129)]. In the prospective Nurse’s Health Study (NHS),
Bernstein and colleagues evaluated the association between
unprocessed red and processed meat consumption and CHD
risk [16(cid:129)]. The analysis included 84,136 women with 3,162
CHD events. After adjusting for various lifestyle and dietary
factors, each 100 g serving/day of unprocessed red meats
was associated with 19 % higher risk of CHD (RR01.19,
95 % CI 01.07–1.32), and each 50 g serving/day of

processed meats was associated with 20 % higher risk (RR0
1.20, 95 % CI01.03–1.40). Matching the serving sizes, each
daily 100 g serving of processed meats was associated with
44 % higher risk (RR01.44, 95 % CI01.06–1.96), or about
2-fold higher than the risk for 100 g of unprocessed meats.
Pan and colleagues [17(cid:129)] re-evaluated the NHS and added
the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS) cohort to
assess the relationships between unprocessed red and pro-
cessed meat consumption and risk of CVD death [17(cid:129)].
Pooling the results of the two cohorts, each serving/day of
unprocessed red meats was associated with 18 % higher risk
of CVD mortality (RR01.18, 95 % CI01.13–1.23), and
each serving/day of processed meats was associated with
21 % higher risk of CVD mortality (RR01.21, 95 % CI0
1.13–1.31). Matching for serving sizes, each daily 100 g
serving of processed meats was associated with 46 % higher
risk (RR01.46, 95 % CI01.28–1.72), about 2-fold higher
compared to unprocessed red meats.

The findings from both our 2010 meta-analysis [1(cid:129)(cid:129)] and
these two updated publications suggest that for every 100 g
serving/day, processed meat consumption has substantial
associations with cardiovascular events (RR’s of 2.02,
1.44, and 1.46 in our meta-analysis, the updated NHS
analysis, and the updated NHS/HPFS analysis, respectively).
In comparison, unprocessed red meat consumption has lesser
or no associations with cardiovascular events (corresponding
RR’s of 1.00, 1.19, and 1.18, respectively). Notably, these
RR’s correspond to daily consumption of 100 g of these
meats, i.e., one serving/day or 7 servings/week. The corre-
sponding RR’s for weekly consumption of 100 g (i.e., one
serving/week) are 1.11, 1.05, and 1.06 for processed meat
consumption, and 1.00, 1.03, and 1.02 for unprocessed red
meat consumption.

The magnitudes of these RR’s for daily vs. weekly con-
sumption are informative for considering risk across popu-
lations. For example, based on our analysis of 2003-2006
NHANES dietary recall data, the median energy-adjusted
intakes of unprocessed red meats and processed meats
among American adults are 1.9 and 1.6 100 g servings/week
(0.3 and 0.2 servings/day), respectively, and the 90th per-
centile intakes are 9.2 and 6.6 servings/week (1.3 and 0.9
servings/day), respectively. Thus, the risk observed per
weekly serving is relevant to much of the US population,
and the risk seen per daily serving is relevant to the highest
consumers of meats.

What about subcategories of unprocessed red or pro-
cessed meats, e.g., hamburger, hot dogs, or deli meats
alone? Unfortunately, relatively few studies have reported
on such subcategories, raising concern for both publication
bias and less generalizability. In our meta-analysis [1(cid:129)(cid:129)], we
identified only two prospective cohorts that reported asso-
ciations of subtypes of unprocessed red meats with CHD
[11], and no prospective studies that reported associations of

subtypes of processed meats with CHD. The two newer
reports described above [16(cid:129), 17(cid:129)] updated the findings from
two earlier reports on subtypes of unprocessed red and
processed meats and CVD. Overall, associations appeared
relatively similar for subtypes of unprocessed red meats, as
well as for most subtypes of processed meats including deli
meats that would often be processed chicken or turkey
except that bacon and hot dogs appeared associated with
relatively higher CHD risk compared with other processed
meat subtypes.

Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus

Using the methods reported in our meta-analysis [1(cid:129)(cid:129)], an
updated meta-analysis by Pan and colleagues [18(cid:129)] eval-
uated the relationship between unprocessed red and pro-
cessed meat consumption and incident DM, including our
previously identified studies plus updated findings from
three Harvard cohorts [19–21]. Consistent with our meta-
analysis, serving sizes were standardized to 100 g for
unprocessed red and 50 g for processed meats. Nine pro-
spective cohort studies, including 447,333 individuals and
28,206 events, assessed the relationship between unpro-
cessed red meat consumption and incident DM (Fig. 2).
Six of nine studies observed a significant independent
positive relationship. In a pooled analysis, each daily
100 g serving of unprocessed red meats was associated
with 19 % higher risk (RR01.19, 95 % CI01.04–1.37).
Per weekly 100 g serving, the corresponding RR was 1.03
(95 % CI01.01–1.05).

Eight prospective cohort studies, including 372,391
individuals and 26,234 events, assessed the relationship
between processed meat consumption and incident DM
(Fig. 2). Eight of nine studies observed a significant inde-
pendent positive relationship. In a pooled analysis, each
50 g daily serving of processed meats was associated with
51 % higher risk (RR01.51, 95 % CI01.25–1.83). Match-
ing the serving sizes for comparability, each daily 100 g
serving of processed meats was associated with a more than
2-fold higher risk of diabetes (RR02.28, 95 % CI01.56–
3.35). Per weekly 100 g serving, the corresponding RR was
1.06 (95 % CI01.03–1.09).

Similar to our meta-analysis [1(cid:129)(cid:129)], in these updated
reports processed meats were predominantly red meats but
also included some processed poultry meats (e.g., chicken or
turkey deli meats and hot dogs) that were not separately
evaluated. Much less is known about these or other subtypes
of processed meats. In our systematic review and meta-
analysis [1(cid:129)(cid:129)], we identified five prospective cohort studies
[19–23] that reported RR’s for subtypes of processed meat
consumption and incident DM. The pooled dose-response
demonstrated that each daily serving of bacon (2 slices) was

2.07, 95 % CI01.40–3.04); of hot dogs, with similarly 2-
fold higher risk (RR01.92, 95 % CI01.33–2.78); and of
other processed meats, with relatively similar 66 % higher
risk (RR01.66, 95 % CI01.13–2.42). Thus, although over-
all data are still somewhat limited, the available evidence
suggests that different types of processed meats, including
deli meats that would be often be processed white meats,
have relatively similar associations with DM.

Following the publication of these findings, Fretts and
colleagues evaluated relationships between unprocessed red
and processed meat consumption and incident diabetes in
the Strong Heart Family Study [24(cid:129)], a population of Amer-
ican Indians with high rates of obesity and diabetes. In
multivariable adjusted analysis including 2,001 participants
and 243 incident DM cases, high vs. low processed meat

consumption was associated with 35 % higher risk (RR0
1.35, 95 % CI00.81–2.25), while high vs. low unprocessed
red meat consumption was not associated with risk (RR0
0.88, 95 % CI00.57, 1.35). In this [24(cid:129)] and other prospec-
tive cohorts [20–22], relatively similar relationships were
observed for various subtypes of unprocessed red meats.

Potential Underlying Mechanisms

Similarities and differences in constituents of unprocessed
red and processed meats can inform potential mechanisms for
their varying relationships with CHD and DM. For instance,
the average saturated fat content of unprocessed red and
processed meats is similar (Table 1), making it unlikely that
saturated fat content accounts for the different observed

Reproduced with permission from Micha et al. (2010) [1(cid:129)(cid:129)]. Based on
data from the 2005-06 US National Health and Nutrition Survey
(NHANES) [60] and a report of published nitrate, nitrite, and nitros-
amine contents of foods [61], each analyzed according to actual US
consumption levels and accounting for the NHANES sampling and
weighting strategies. All mean differences were significant at p<0.05

relationships with disease risk. This is supported by evidence
for no overall association of saturated fat consumption with
incident CHD or DM [4, 25–30], perhaps because such effects
vary depending on both the food source of saturated fat [31]
and the macronutrient replacing saturated fat [27]. Average
total fat content is higher in processed meats, but largely due
to higher contents of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated
fats, which are not linked to higher CHD or DM risk. Together
these findings suggest that other components of meats may be
relevant to cardiometabolic effects.

Average contents of dietary cholesterol are similar in
unprocessed red and processed meats, or even a bit lower
in the latter, likely due to low-cholesterol white deli meats
(Table 1). Whereas few prospective studies have evaluated
dietary cholesterol and incident CHD or DM, the available
evidence suggests little association with incident CHD in
the general population, but a positive association with inci-
dent DM [26, 32–35]. Thus, dietary cholesterol content
could partly account for the associations of unprocessed
red and processed meat consumption with DM, although
the similar contents of dietary cholesterol would not explain
the substantially higher DM risk seen with processed meats.

Dietary heme iron may increase oxidative stress and
insulin resistance, and has been associated with higher risk
of DM [36–38]. Thus, heme iron in both unprocessed red
and processed meats could partly explain their relations with
incident DM. However, average heme iron content is lower
in processed meats (consistent with higher fat and lower
protein; Table 1), so this also would not explain the stronger
association of processed meats with DM risk.

Among major constituents, the largest difference between
processed and unprocessed meats is in the content of pres-
ervatives, especially sodium (Table 1). On average, pro-
cessed meats contain about 400 % more sodium and 50 %
more nitrates per gram. Dietary sodium increases blood
pressure (BP), and may also increase peripheral vascular
resistance and impair arterial compliance [39]. Based on
the established effects of sodium on BP [40] and the rela-
tionship between BP and clinical CHD events [41], the
average sodium consumed from one daily 50 g serving of
processed meats would predict about 27 % higher risk of
CHD, or more than two-third (on the log RR scale) of the
observed 42 % higher risk seen in cohort studies. Thus,
sodium content alone is likely to account for a substantial
portion of the observed CHD risk with processed meat
consumption. In addition, the much lower average sodium
content in unprocessed meats likely explains its smaller
association with CHD. Other preservatives used in pro-
cessed meats, such as nitrates and their byproducts (e.g.,
peroxynitrite), experimentally promote endothelial dysfunc-
tion, atherosclerosis, and insulin resistance [42–44]; and
streptozotocin, a nitrosamine-related compound, is a known
diabetogenic compound [45]. Nitrites and nitrous com-
pounds have also been associated with type 1 diabetes in
children [46, 47]; while in adults, nitrate concentrations
have been used as a biomarker of endothelial dysfunction
[48] and impaired insulin response [49]. Thus, higher
nitrates/nitrates in processed meats could further explain
their stronger relationships with both CHD and DM.

Different meat preparation methods could also influence
health effects. High temperature commercial cooking or
frying, commonly used in preparing processed meats, can
introduce heterocyclic amines and polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons, which could increase risk of both CHD and
DM [50–52]. Relatively little human research has been done
on meat preparation methods and these disease outcomes,
and further study is urgently needed.

Meat Consumption and Cardiometabolic
Diseases—Potential for Bias

Considering the major criteria for evaluating causality [6–9],
there appears to be consistency, temporality, dose-response,
and plausible mechanisms for each of the associations

Curr Atheroscler Rep (2012) 14:515–524

521

described above. In observational studies, residual con-
founding due to imprecisely measured or unmeasured con-
founders can never be fully excluded. Thus, a key additional
criterion is the magnitude of the association, which (if large)
can provide reassurance that residual confounding is less
likely to fully explain the relationship; or (if small) can raise
concern that much or all of the observed associations may
be due to bias or residual confounding. For processed
meats and risk of CHD and DM, the magnitudes of the
associations suggest that residual confounding is unlikely
to fully account for the observed higher risk. For unpro-
cessed meats and risk of CHD and DM, however,
the
more modest associations do raise concern for potential
bias.

It is relevant to consider the plausible directions of effects
of such bias. In each of the cohorts that have evaluated meat
consumption and chronic diseases, greater meat consump-
tion is associated with less favorable lifestyle and dietary
behaviors, including for example less physical activity,
increased smoking, increased total energy (consistent with
higher BMI), and lower fruit, vegetable, dietary fiber, whole
grains and fish intake, and higher alcohol and trans fat
intake [15, 16(cid:129), 17(cid:129), 18(cid:129), 22, 23]. Residual confounding by
these factors, or their correlates, would cause overestimation
of harmful effects of meat consumption. Consequently, the
magnitude of the observed harmful associations between
unprocessed red or processed meat consumption and CHD
and DM could be overestimated, particularly in studies that
do not comprehensively adjust for a range of lifestyle and
dietary habits.

The possible magnitude of such overestimation can be
challenging to quantify. In such circumstances, use of a
“negative control” is informative: i.e., the evaluation of a
separate health outcome for which the exposure of interest
has little plausible biologic mechanism or expectation for a
meaningful causal effect. One recent report provides useful
data in this regard [15]. This large prospective cohort study
reported positive associations for both total (processed and
unprocessed) red meat and processed meat consumption and
risk of cancer and CVD mortality (separate associations for
unprocessed red meats were not published and could not be
obtained by direct contact with the authors). Notably, this
report also evaluated other causes of mortality, including a
category of “all other deaths” that would predominantly be
from chronic pulmonary diseases, pneumonia, diabetes, and
chronic liver disease [53, 54]. Except for diabetes, there is
little plausible biologic mechanism for a large effect of meat
intake on these other types of deaths, and certainly none
expected to be as great as effects on cancer or cardiovascular
death. However, in this analysis, the observed associations
of total red meat and processed meat consumption with
these “other deaths” was actually considerably stronger than
for cancer or cardiovascular deaths. One could hypothesize

that meat consumption did have some very powerful, here-
tofore unrecognized causal effects on deaths from chronic
pulmonary disease, pneumonia, and chronic liver disease.
More plausibly, participants consuming more meats had
other important lifestyle behaviors affecting mortality that
were not fully accounted for in the analysis. Plausible con-
founders included major risk factors that were assessed but
measured with imprecision, such as education, physical
activity, smoking, alcohol use, adiposity, and fruit and veg-
etable consumption; and other potential confounders not
included in the model at all, such as income, second-hand
smoke, air pollution, alcohol patterns (e.g., binge drinking),
and consumption of starches, refined carbohydrates, sugars,
trans fat, dietary fiber, whole grains, nuts, seeds, and
legumes [54].

Bias can also reduce observed associations. In large
observational studies, random errors in measurement of
self-reported diet can cause bias toward the null, causing
underestimation of true associations. Similarly, adjustment
for factors which could be potential intermediates in the
causal pathway between meat consumption and CHD or
DM would also cause inappropriate bias toward the null.
Several of the studies in our meta-analysis did adjust for
factors that could be either confounders or intermediates,
mainly blood lipids and/or blood pressure concentrations
[12, 13, 19, 21, 55–57]. Thus, the net effects of residual
confounding (which here would overestimate effects) ver-
sus random errors in dietary assessment and overadjustment
for intermediates (which here would underestimate effects)
should always be considered. Large observed effects in the
setting of comprehensive covariate adjustment are reassur-
ing; small observed effects in the setting of incomplete
adjustment are concerning, particularly when relations with
“negative control” outcomes are similar or even more
robust.

Conclusions

The available evidence indicates strong associations of pro-
cessed meat consumption with incident CHD and DM, more
modest associations of unprocessed red meat consumption
with incident DM, and small or no associations of unpro-
cessed red meat consumption with incident CHD. Our
review of this evidence also highlights the importance of
appropriate categorization of meat types and careful consid-
eration of magnitudes and directions of bias (e.g., due to
confounding, overadjustment, or misclassification) when
evaluating associations of meat intake with clinical end-
points. The most relevant constituents for cardiometabolic
effects may include dietary cholesterol, heme iron, and
nitrates/nitrites for risk of DM; and sodium and nitrates/
nitrites for risk of CHD. These findings suggest
that

522

Curr Atheroscler Rep (2012) 14:515–524

clinical and public health guidance should prioritize reduc-
tion of processed meat consumption to reduce CHD and
DM risk, as well as reduction of sodium and other preser-
vative contents of processed meats. The 2010 US Dietary
Guidelines for Americans recommend selecting lean meats,
increasing the amount of seafood consumed in place of
some meat and poultry, and specifically limiting processed
meats [58]. The recommendation to select lean meats was
partly based on saturated fat and dietary cholesterol content
and consequent effects on blood LDL-cholesterol. Interest-
ingly, our analysis suggests that other constituents may be
more relevant.

Our findings have additional implications. First, it may
be misguided to promote consumption of processed deli
meats, such as processed chicken, turkey, or bologna, as
“healthy” alternatives on the basis of their lower total fat
or saturated fat contents. The current evidence suggests that
processed meats are particularly harmful for CHD and DM,
and that the content of sodium and other preservatives,
rather than total fat or saturated fat, may be most relevant.
While further investigation is needed to determine if differ-
ent subcategories of processed meats have different effects
on cardiometabolic risk, based on the current evidence it
would be prudent to minimize consumption of all processed
meats. Second, because sodium and possibly other preser-
vatives appear particularly relevant, especially for CHD
risk, new industry focus on reducing these additives would
be particularly important for reducing the harms of pro-
cessed meat consumption.

Whereas the evidence indicates that reducing processed
meat consumption should be a priority for clinical and
public health guidance, and that unprocessed red meat con-
sumption has smaller effects on DM and little or no effect on
CHD, no evidence from these studies suggested any cardi-
ometabolic benefits of unprocessed red meat consumption.
Additionally, cattle farming has tremendous adverse envi-
ronmental impacts, including on deforestation, water use,
and carbon and methane emissions [59]. Thus, healthier
alternatives with strong evidence for cardiometabolic ben-
efits, such as fish, nuts, fruits, whole grains, and vegeta-
bles, are vastly preferable dietary choices to consuming
unprocessed red meats. Still, for individual and public
health focus, prioritizing reduction in processed meats as
well as other harmful dietary factors, such as partially
hydrogenated vegetable oils, high-sodium foods, and
refined grains, starches, and sugars, is likely to produce
the largest net benefits for both individual and population
health.

ORIGINAL INVESTIGATION

Dairy Consumption and Risk
of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in Men

A Prospective Study

Hyon K. Choi, MD, DrPH; Walter C. Willett, MD, DrPH; Meir J. Stampfer, MD, DrPH;
Eric Rimm, ScD; Frank B. Hu, MD, PhD

Background: Diet and lifestyle modifications can sub-
stantially reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes. While a strong
inverse association has been reported between dairy con-
sumption and the insulin resistance syndrome among
young obese adults, the relation between dairy intake and
type 2 diabetes is unknown.

Methods: We prospectively examined the relation be-
tween dairy intake and incident cases of type 2 diabetes
in 41 254 male participants with no history of diabetes,
cardiovascular disease, and cancer at baseline in the Health
Professionals Follow-up Study.

Results: During 12 years of follow-up, we documented
1243 incident cases of type 2 diabetes. Dairy intake was
associated with a modestly lower risk of type 2 diabetes.
After adjusting for potential confounders, including
body mass index, physical activity, and dietary factors,

the relative risk for type 2 diabetes in men in the top
quintile of dairy intake was 0.77 (95% confidence inter-
val [CI], 0.62-0.95; P for trend, .003) compared with
those in the lowest quintile. Each serving-per-day
increase in total dairy intake was associated with a 9%
lower risk for type 2 diabetes (multivariate relative risk,
0.91; 95% CI, 0.85-0.97). The corresponding relative
risk was 0.88 (95% CI, 0.81-0.94) for low-fat dairy
intake and 0.99 (95% CI, 0.91-1.07) for high-fat dairy
intake. The association did not vary significantly
according to body mass index (⬍25 vs ⱖ25 kg/m2;
P for interaction, .57).

Conclusion: Dietary patterns characterized by higher
dairy intake, especially low-fat dairy intake, may lower
the risk of type 2 diabetes in men.

T YPE 2 DIABETES AFFECTS AP-

proximately 16 million
people in the United States
and 135 million people
worldwide; the number of
people with diabetes will reach an esti-
mated 300 million worldwide by 2025.1,2
Because management of diabetes and its
complications, such as cardiovascular dis-
ease, amputation, blindness, and renal fail-
ure, imposes enormous medical and eco-
nomic burdens, primary prevention has
become a public health imperative.1

Recent studies have shown that diet and
lifestyle modifications are important means
of preventing type 2 diabetes.1,3 Dairy con-
sumption is a dietary factor that might affect
type 2 diabetes. Several studies have sug-
gested that dairy products may have favor-
able effects on body weight, the major de-
terminant of type 2 diabetes.4-6 In addition,

a few studies, but not all, have suggested that
dairy or calcium consumption was associ-
ated with lower risks for hypertension,7,8 co-
agulopathy,9 coronary artery disease,10,11 and
stroke.12,13 An inverse cross-sectional asso-
ciation between dairy intake and insulin
resistance syndrome (IRS) was observed
in men.14 Furthermore, the Coronary Ar-
tery Risk Development in Young Adults
(CARDIA) Study recently reported a strong
inverse association between dairy consump-
tion and IRS among young obese adults.15
To date, no published studies have ex-
amined the relation between dairy con-
sumption and type 2 diabetes. Therefore,
we prospectively evaluated the relation
between dairy intake and incident type 2
diabetes in a large cohort of men.

The participants returned a mailed questionnaire in 1986 con-
cerning diet, medical history, and medications. We excluded men
with implausibly high (⬎4200 kcal/d [⬎17 573 kJ/d) or low (⬍800
kcal/d [⬍3347 kJ/d]) total energy intake and/or blank responses
for more than 70 of the 131 food items on the diet questionnaire.
We also excluded men with a history of diabetes, cardiovascular
disease (angina, coronary bypass or angioplasty, myocardial in-
farction, or stroke), or cancer (except for nonmelanoma skin can-
cer) because these diseases affect diet or reporting of diet. After
these exclusions, 41 254 participants remained in the analysis.

ASSESSMENT OF DIET

To assess dietary intake, we used a semiquantitative food-
frequency questionnaire that inquired about the average use
of approximately 130 foods and beverages during the previ-
ous year.16,17 The baseline dietary questionnaire was com-
pleted in 1986 and was updated in 1990 and 1994. Nutrient
intake was computed from the reported frequency of consump-
tion of each specified unit of food or beverage and from pub-
lished data on the nutrient content of the specified portions.17
Food and nutrient intakes assessed by this dietary ques-
tionnaire have been validated previously against two 1-week
diet records in this cohort.16,18 The Pearson correlation coeffi-
cients for intake measured by two 1-week diet records and by
the food-frequency questionnaire, adjusted for week-to-week
variation in the diet records, were 0.62 both for low-fat dairy
foods and for high-fat dairy foods.18

ASSESSMENT OF NONDIETARY FACTORS

At baseline and every 2 years thereafter, participants provided in-
formation on body weight, regular use of medications, and medi-
cal conditions. Body mass index was calculated by dividing the
weight in kilograms by the square of the height in meters. The
follow-up for this cohort exceeded 90% during the study period.

ASCERTAINMENT OF INCIDENT TYPE 2

DIABETES MELLITUS

We mailed a supplementary questionnaire on symptoms, di-
agnostic tests, and medication to all men who reported a di-
agnosis of diabetes on any of the biennial follow-up question-
naires (n=2056). Confirmation of diabetes required at least one
of the following: (1) an elevated plasma glucose concentration
(fasting plasma glucose ⱖ140 mg/dL [ⱖ7.8 mmol/L], random
plasma glucose ⱖ200 mg/dL [ⱖ11.1 mmol/L], and/or plasma
glucose ⱖ200 mg/dL [ⱖ11.1 mmol/L] after ⱖ2 hours during
an oral glucose tolerance test) plus at least one classic symp-
tom (excessive thirst, polyuria, weight loss, or hunger); (2) at
least two elevated plasma glucose concentrations on different
occasions; or (3) treatment with insulin or oral hypoglycemic
medication. The diagnostic criteria for type 2 diabetes were
changed in 1997.19 However, we used the criteria proposed by
the National Diabetes Data Group20 because the vast majority
of cases of diabetes in this study occurred before 1997. Men
who reported that they had type 1 diabetes on the supplemen-
tary questionnaire were excluded. The validity of our assess-
ment of type 2 diabetes was verified with medical records in a
sample of 71 participants. A physician blinded to the informa-
tion on the supplementary questionnaire reviewed the rec-
ords according to the diagnostic criteria. Of the 71 partici-
pants who were classified as having type 2 diabetes, 12 had
incomplete records (eg, absent laboratory data [n=2] or only
one set of laboratory data [n=9]). Among the remaining 59 par-
ticipants, the classification of type 2 diabetes was confirmed

in 57 (97%). One patient denied having diabetes, and one lacked
evidence of diabetes in his submitted records.

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS

We computed person-time of follow-up for each participant from
the return date of the 1986 questionnaire to the date of diag-
nosis of type 2 diabetes, death from any cause, or the end of
the study period, whichever came first.

To represent long-term dairy intake patterns of individual sub-
jects, we used cumulative average dairy intake based on infor-
mation from the 1986, 1990, and 1994 dietary questionnaires.21
For example, the incidence of type 2 diabetes from 1986 through
1990 was related to dairy intake reported on the 1986 question-
naire, and incidence from 1990 through 1994 was related to the
average intake reported on the 1986 and 1990 questionnaires.
We repeated our analyses using baseline dairy intake (1986).

We used Cox proportional hazards modeling to estimate the
relative risk (RR) for incident type 2 diabetes in all multivariate
analyses (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC). Responses to the indi-
vidual dairy items were converted to average daily number of serv-
ings of each item. The average daily intakes of individual dairy
items were combined to compute dairy intake: low-fat dairy prod-
ucts, including skim/lowfat milk, sherbet, yogurt, and cottage/
ricotta cheese; high-fat dairy foods, including whole milk, cream,
sour cream, ice cream, cream cheese, and other cheese; and all
dairy products, including all of the above. The average daily dairy
intake was categorized into quintiles of intake and each quintile
was compared with the lowest quintile. Multivariate models were
adjusted for age (continuous), total energy intake (continuous),
family history of diabetes (yes or no), smoking status (never
smoked; former smoker; current smoker, 1-14 cigarettes per day;
current smoker, 15-24 cigarettes per day; or current smoker, ⱖ25
cigarettes per day), body mass index (⬍23.0, 23.0-23.9, 24.0-
24.9, 2.5-26.9, 2.7-28.9, 2.9-30.9, 31.0-34.9, or ⱖ35.0), hyper-
cholesterolemia at baseline (yes or no), hypertension at baseline
(yes or no), physical activity (quintiles of metabolic equivalent
tasks [METs]), cereal fiber intake (quintiles), trans-fat intake (quin-
tiles), ratio of polyunsaturated fat to saturated fat (quintiles), gly-
cemic load (quintiles), and alcohol consumption (0, 0.1-4.9, 5.0-
14.9, 15-29.9, or ⱖ30.0 g/d). We evaluated potential confounding
by other possible dietary risk factors for type 2 diabetes (ie, nuts,1
processed meat,22 fruits,23 vegetables,23 coffee intake,24 Western
dietary pattern,25 and prudent dietary pattern25) by entering each
term (5 categories for coffee intake and quintiles for the others)
into the multivariate model. The RR for the continuous mea-
sures indicates the change in risk associated with an average in-
crement of one serving per day of the standard portion size. To
assess the trends, we used the median values of intake for each
category to minimize the influence of outliers. We conducted analy-
ses stratified by body mass index (⬍25 vs ⱖ25), family history,
or physical activity (⬍12.2 METs/wk [ie, median value] vs ⱖ12.2
METs/wk) to assess possible effect modification. We tested the
significance of the interaction using the likelihood ratio test by
comparing a model that included the main effects of dairy intake
along with the stratifying variable and the interaction terms with
a reduced model that included only the main effects. We calcu-
lated 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for all RRs. All P values are
two sided.

with higher dairy intake tended to have slightly lower
alcohol consumption, a higher level of physical activity,
a less common history of hypertension and hypercho-
lesterolemia, a higher intake of trans-fats, a higher
glycemic load, a lower ratio of polyunsaturated fat to satu-
rated fat, and higher intakes of fruits and vegetables. Other
characteristics were similar across the quintile groups
(Table 1).

DAIRY PRODUCT CONSUMPTION
AND INCIDENT TYPE 2 DIABETES

During the 12-year follow-up, we documented 1243 in-
cident cases of type 2 diabetes. After adjusting for age,
the RR for men in the top quintile of total dairy intake
was 0.82 (95% CI, 0.67-1.00; P for trend, .02) compared
with those in the lowest quintile. After further adjust-
ment for other risk factors, the association became stron-
ger (RR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.62-0.95; P for trend, .003)
(Table 2). When we additionally adjusted for nuts, pro-
cessed meat, fruits, vegetables, coffee consumption, and
dietary patterns one at a time, the results did not mate-
rially change. Each serving-per-day increase in dairy in-
take was associated with a 9% lower risk for type 2 dia-
betes (multivariate RR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.85-0.97). The
associations were essentially the same using baseline in-
formation on dairy intake and covariates. Furthermore,
when we limited our cases to only symptomatic cases
(n=763), the results did not materially change.

When we examined the association with dairy prod-
ucts stratified by their fat contents, the significant inverse
association was primarily limited to low-fat dairy consump-
tion (Table 3). Most individual low-fat dairy products and
ice cream showed a similar inverse trend but only skim milk

reached statistical significance (multivariate RR per serv-
ing, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.83-0.97) (Table 4).

ADDITIONAL MULTIVARIATE ANALYSES

ADJUSTING FOR ELECTROLYTES

When we additionally adjusted for total (or dietary) mag-
nesium or potassium intake, our results did not materi-
ally change. There was a close correlation between dairy
intake and total or dietary calcium intake (eg, Pearson cor-
relation coefficient for low-fat dairy intake and dietary cal-
cium, 0.79), and additional adjustment of these variables
reduced the statistical significance of dairy intake, al-
though the magnitude of association remained similar. For
example, when we added dietary calcium intake in our mul-
tivariate model, the RR between the extreme quintiles was
0.76 (95% CI, 0.57-1.02; P for trend, .07) for low-fat dairy
intake and 0.90 (95% CI, 0.63-1.28; P for trend, .55) for
dietary calcium intake. However, when we adjusted for
supplemental calcium, our results did not materially change.

ANALYSES STRATIFIED BY BODY MASS INDEX,

FAMILY HISTORY, OR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY

The association between dairy intake and type 2 diabe-
tes did not significantly vary by body mass index (⬍25
vs ⱖ25), family history, or physical activity (P⬎.50 for
all) (Table 5).

tion, especially low-fat dairy consumption, and inci-
dence of type 2 diabetes. This association was indepen-
dent of age, family history of diabetes, smoking, body mass
index, physical activity, history of hypercholesterol-
emia and hypertension, and other known dietary risk fac-
tors for type 2 diabetes. Overall, the modest protective
effect of dairy intake was consistent across different sub-
groups stratified by body mass index, physical activity,
and family history of diabetes.

Dairy intake may protect against type 2 diabetes by
favorably affecting known risk factors or precursors of
the disease. Studies have suggested favorable effects on
body weight,4-6,15 hypertension,7,8,15 and abnormal glu-
cose homeostasis.15 The CARDIA Study reported a strong

inverse association between dairy intake and risk of IRS
among young adults who were overweight (body mass
index ⱖ25) but not among leaner individuals.15 In our
study the association between dairy intake and type 2 dia-
betes did not vary significantly by body mass index, and
the overall magnitude of the association (9% reduction
in RR per serving increase in dairy foods) was notably
smaller than the association with IRS shown among over-
weight young adults in the CARDIA Study (21%).15 Fur-
thermore, in the CARDIA Study the association was pres-
ent with both high-fat and low-fat dairy products but in
our study it was limited to low-fat dairy intake. Poten-
tial explanations behind these differences (other than the
outcome difference) include age difference (at the time

of dairy exposure or outcome measurement) and dilu-
tion of effect in the later phases of the causal pathway
toward type 2 diabetes. Regardless, the strong inverse as-
sociation between dairy intake and risk of IRS in young
adulthood shown in the CARDIA Study may not di-
rectly relate to risk of type 2 diabetes later in life.

The mechanism behind the inverse association be-
tween dairy intake and risk of type 2 diabetes remains
unclear. Electrolytes in dairy foods, such as calcium and
magnesium, may lower the risk of IRS and type 2 diabe-
tes.15 When we additionally adjusted for these electro-
lytes, our results suggested that the association between
dairy intake and type 2 diabetes was independent of these
factors, although adjustment for dietary calcium was

somewhat limited by its close correlation with dairy in-
take. Other major components in dairy products, such
as lactose and dairy protein, may enhance satiety and re-
duce the risk of overweight and obesity (the major risk
factor for type 2 diabetes) compared with other high-
carbohydrate foods and beverages.15 However, satu-
rated fat contained in dairy foods may mitigate these po-
tential benefits, which may explain the weaker or null
association with high-fat dairy foods observed in our study.
While a lower glycemic index associated with dairy in-
take may reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes, our results
showed an independent association after adjusting for gly-
cemic load. Similarly, although lifestyle factors, includ-
ing dietary patterns associated with dairy intake, may be

responsible for lowering the risk, further adjustment for
dietary patterns (Western vs prudent)25 did not materi-
ally affect our results.

For the potential public health application of our
results, other potential benefits and risks associated
with dairy intake should be taken into account. Studies
have suggested that intake of low-fat dairy foods is asso-
ciated with several potential health benefits, including
lower incidence rates of coronary heart disease,26 pre-
menopausal breast cancer,27 colon cancer,28 and gout.29
Furthermore, low-fat dairy foods are one of the main
components of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hyper-
tension (DASH) diet, which has been shown to substan-
tially lower blood pressure.30 However, dairy consump-
tion, including low-fat dairy foods, has been implicated
in possible increases in rates of prostate cancer.31 Fur-
ther confirmation of these findings and comprehensive
risk-benefit assessments are necessary before public
health recommendations for dairy consumption can be
made.

Several strengths and potential limitations of our study
deserve comment. Although our study is observational,
with the potential for unmeasured confounding as in all
epidemiologic studies, the prospective design and high
rate of follow-up minimized the possibility of recall bias
and bias caused by loss to follow-up. Furthermore, the
extensive information on potential confounders and the
large study size allowed comprehensive adjustment of con-
founders. Self-reported diabetes was confirmed by a
supplementary questionnaire, and validation with medi-
cal records indicated that reporting of diabetes was highly
accurate in this medically knowledgeable population.
Some underdiagnosis of diabetes is likely because screen-
ing for blood glucose was not feasible, given the size of
the cohort. However, compared with the general popu-
lation, the degree of underdiagnosis was probably smaller
in this cohort of health professionals with ready access
to medical care. Moreover, underascertainment of cases,
if not associated with exposure, would not be expected
to affect the RR estimates.32 Our findings are most di-
rectly generalizable to men 40 years old and older with
no history of type 2 diabetes. Whether these findings

apply to women or men with existing diabetes remains
to be studied.

In conclusion, dietary patterns characterized by higher
dairy intake, especially low-fat dairy intake, may lower
the risk of type 2 diabetes.

meta-analysis: relations between dietary glycemic properties and
health outcomes1–5

Geoffrey Livesey, Richard Taylor, Toine Hulshof, and John Howlett

ABSTRACT
Background: Reduction of dietary glycemic response has been
proposed as a means of reducing the risk of diabetes and coronary
heart disease. The impact of glycemic response on markers of health
remains to be elucidated.
Objective: We assessed the evidence relating the glycemic impact
of foods to measures relevant for health maintenance and manage-
ment of disease.
Design: This was a systematic review and synthesis of interven-
tional evidence from literature reported on glycemic index and mark-
ers of health through the use of meta-analyses and meta-regression
models.
Results: Data from 45 relevant publications were found to January
2005. Lower glycemic index (GI) diets reduced both fasting blood
glucose and glycated proteins independently of variance in available
and unavailable carbohydrate intakes. Elevated unavailable carbo-
hydrate added to improvements in both blood glucose and glycated
protein control. These effects were greater in persons with poor
fasting blood glucose control. No effects were seen on fasting insulin
쏝100 pmol/L; above this, study numbers were few but consistent
with prevention of hyperinsulinemia in some but not all overweight
persons. Insulin sensitivity according to a variety of measurement
methods was improved by lower GI, higher unavailable carbohy-
drate interventions in persons with type 2 diabetes, in overweight and
obese persons, and in all studies combined. Fasting triacylglycerol in
addition to body weight reduction related more to glycemic load than
to GI. Glycemic load reduction by 쏜17 g glucose equivalents/d was
associated with reduced body weight.
Conclusions: Consumption of reduced glycemic response diets are
followed by favorable changes in the health markers examined. The
case for the use of such diets looks compelling. Unavailable carbo-
hydrate intake is equally important.

INTRODUCTION

Foods vary in their ability to provoke a postprandial glycemic
response in humans. This response has been quantified in various
ways, including the glycemic index (GI) (1), the relative GI (2),
the glycemic load (GL) (3), and others such as the glycemic
glucose equivalent (4) or the equivalent GL (5). For the present,

information about GI and GL is available for a wide variety of
foods (6), and such information has formed the basis of 45 rel-
evant intervention studies in humans to ascertain whether foods
with a low impact on blood glucose also have a high impact on
disease risk reduction (7). Possibly central to all these approaches
is GL, which may be indexed to carbohydrate or to food weight
or to serving size for the purpose of describing the food and
estimating cumulative intakes (8).

Although information from intervention studies has been re-
viewed previously (7, 9 –12), none of those reviews focused on
the contribution of GL versus GI and the role of unavailable
carbohydrate in studies on reduced GI, or why GI appears not to
show dose-dependent effects on health risk factors, issues that
are addressed at present. Such information is critical to an un-
derstanding of whether interventions to reduce the glycemic im-
pact of the diet might be useful either as a treatment modality or
as a public health measure. It is already clear from epidemiologic
studies in the United States and Europe that the intake of both
unavailable and available carbohydrate of low GI or low GL each
may have a role in prevention of metabolic disease. For example,
type 2 diabetes (3, 13, 14), coronary heart disease (2), and health
risk markers for both diabetes and heart disease (15, 16) each
associate statistically with the glycemic impact of foods (GI or
GL). Although epidemiology can provide ideas about possible
public health strategy and treatment plans, interventional studies
are essential to proving whether such ideas work in practice and
to uncovering any unforeseen influences limiting utility of the
approach.

FOOD, GLYCEMIA, AND HEALTH RISK

259S

A previous article showed that studies that lower GI as a
treatment plan may also reduce the intakes of available carbo-
hydrate and metabolizable energy significantly, though without
elevating fat intake (7). Low GI diets also may elevate the intake
of unavailable carbohydrate and protein to variable extents (7).
We therefore implement meta-regression as well as meta-
analysis as one of our investigative tools to assess what dietary
factors are important in affecting health risk markers.

From a user perspective, meta-analysis and meta-regression
call for somewhat different approaches. The latter requires more
data, but has the potential to assess the significance of covariates.
The former aims for datasets that are homogenous, ie without
variation in observations between different studies of the same
‘fixed’ effect (17, 18). However, meta-regression aims for a
heterogeneous dataset and attempts to explain the heterogeneity
(19, 20), which may otherwise appear to be a ‘random’ effect.
Doing so in the present context can provide a broader under-
standing of the factors influencing health risk. This would seem
especially important in nutrition in general where study out-
comes can often vary appreciably from one study to another. The
heterogeneous data set analyzed at present includes persons who
are healthy, glucose intolerant, type 1 or 2 diabetic, at primary
(due to family history) or secondary coronary heart disease risk,
and hyperlipidemic. Among these subject groups were either
normal weight or overweight or obese persons (7). In combining
data from such varied health types it was convenient to consider
health risk markers to represent a continuum from the healthy
state to the diseased state, and this seems to represent the situation
for both diabetes and coronary heart disease (21, 22). In addition
we considered study outcomes by categories: by health type, by
different types of food intake control and by different body
weight bands; normal, overweight, and obese (7).

MATERIALS AND METHODS

The construction of a database comprising data extracted from
45 controlled dietary intervention trials on GI reported in the
literature to January 2005 has been described previously (7).
Information is given there also about the literature search, the
inclusion and exclusion criteria, data extraction, and the calcu-
lation methods.

The database includes observations from 972 participants per
treatment arm of all ages (study group mean ages 10 to 63 y) with
both males (511) and females (461) represented. Participants
were either normal weight (16 studies), overweight (18 studies)
or obese (10 studies) or unclassified by weight (1 study). Similar
numbers of participants took part per treatment arm (770 on the
high and 793 on the low GI treatment). Study participants were
either healthy, ie no diagnosis of disease was evident (13 studies)
or had impaired glucose tolerance (2 studies, duration of impair-
ment unknown) or had type 1 diabetes (7 studies, mean duration
from diagnosis 3 to 16 y, one unknown duration) or had type 2
diabetes (17 studies, mean duration from diagnosis 앒0 to 12.5 y,
7 unknown duration) or were at risk of primary CHD (4 studies,
duration unknown) or secondary CHD (1 study, duration un-
known) or had hyperlipidemia (1 study combining Type II a,
Type II b, and Type III; mean duration from diagnosis 4.7 y).
Studies included participants on medication. Insulin dosage was
reported in all 7 studies with persons with type 1 diabetes, 2 of 17
studies with persons with type 2 diabetes, and in one of one study
with participants at risk of secondary CHD. In all but one study

with persons with type 2 diabetes, subjects received non-insulin
medication for glycemic control (hypoglycemic agents).

Categorization of studies according health type was based on
what authors stated was the study group condition. The same
studies were cross categorized also according to body weight as
normal, overweight or obese, again according to what authors
stated or according to body mass index (bands cut at BMI 쏜 25
or 쏜 30 kg/m2). Interventions were by diet, with intention to
exchange the form of available carbohydrate (high versus low
GI). All studies were free-living, ie no subjects were hospital-
ized, housed in metabolic wards or centers of human nutrition.
Biochemical risk factors extracted were fasting blood glucose,
fasting insulin, glycated proteins (HbA1c and fructosamine and
these combined, glycated albumin and glycated protein), insulin
sensitivity, retrospectively calculated insulin sensitivity by ho-
meostatic model assessment (HOMA %S), calculated pancreatic
B-cell function (HOMA %B), cholesterol (total, LDL and HDL)
and fasting plasma triacylglycerols. Risk factors not reported on
here were either a) complex (HOMA model) and so receives only
brief comment or b) showed evidence of one or more factors
confounding results of simple meta-analyses (total and fractions
of cholesterol) or c) were too few to analyze separately (glycated
albumin and glycated protein combined). At this time these data
simply remain to be more fully assessed.

Body weight was the only constitutional risk factor extracted.
Dietary risk or nutritional factors extracted were metabolizable
energy, fat, available carbohydrate, unavailable carbohydrate,
and protein intake, together with potential risk factors GI and the
calculated GL. The last was calculated as GI multiplied by avail-
able carbohydrate intake and was expressed as g. glucose equiv-
alents. Duration of treatment was extracted either as a continuous
variable (weeks) or as a categorical variable by treatment dura-
tion 쏝 or 욷 12 wk.

Data were subjected to random effects meta-analyses and
meta-regressions using meta and metareg the latter using re-
stricted maximum likelihood (REML) in Stata 9.2 SE (Stata-
Corp, TX) according to Cochrane guidelines (17). Studies are
weighted by inverse variance. Analyses are reported as either
random effects or when variation between studies was zero they
are reported as fixed effects. Computation of the study effect and
dependent SE were as described previously (7) for inputting as
the mean effect (Ø) and the SEM effect (seØ) study-by-study (in
STATA terminology). For comparison of treatments we use
methods difference versus methods average (23). Discussion of
this and other approaches can be found elsewhere together with
developments in multivariate meta-analyses (20). While the be-
havior of univariate meta-regression allows valid inferences
given valid datasets, the validity and behavior of bivariate meta-
regression has only recently been investigated and recommended
over multiple uses of univariate analyses (19). Bivariate meta-
regression is reported to inflate heterogeneity without systematic
bias in the coefficients; this tends to widen the CIs and provide
conservative estimates of significant effects. It seems reasonable
for the present to make a similar assumption about multivariate
meta-regression models in general. We assume ‘measurement
error’ is not a cause of bias. This appears reasonable when in-
vestigating relations with dietary variables that are highly heter-
ogeneous, as in the present dataset (7). However, failure of this
assumption would lead to under strength regression coefficients

RESULTS

Fasting blood glucose concentrations

Thirty-six studies reported fasting blood glucose concentra-
tions in either venous plasma or capillary blood and achieved
reductions in GI ranging from 4 to 32, with accompanying re-
ductions in GL ranging from 6 to 134 g glucose equivalents.
Study durations ranged from 2 to 26 wk.

Subjects were reported as normal healthy (8 studies), glucose
intolerant (2 studies), type 1diabetic (4 studies), type 2 diabetic
(16 studies), type 1 and type 2 diabetic observations combined (1
study) and at risk of primary (4 studies) or secondary coronary
heart disease (1 study). For analysis, fasting venous plasma glu-
cose concentrations were converted to the equivalent capillary

The totality of evidence on fasting blood glucose (Figure 1)
includes intermediate observations made at timed intervals up to
the end of the treatment period in addition to the end of treatment
observations. The figure is plotted according to the convention
for methods comparison (difference plotted against average).
Visual inspection shows no overall treatment difference in fast-
ing blood glucose concentration to be evident when the study
population mean is approx. 5 mmol/L. When above 5 mmol/L
(22 studies) the lower glycemic treatment outcome departed in-
creasingly from that on the higher glycemic treatment, with the
difference being greatest for the highest average of treatment
means. After omitting the intermediate observations to obtain
independent information, meta-regression revealed a significant
relation (slope Ҁ0.30 SE 0.10 ⌬mmol/L per mmol/L; P쏝 兩kh-t兩
҃ 0.010, df 20, Tau 0.6 mmol/L). Further omitting of observa-
tions so that all studies had fasting blood glucose 쏜 5 mmol/L and
all study participants were fed diets intended at energy mainte-
nance resulted in 18 studies remaining for which meta-regression
again indicates a significant relation (Figure 2; slope Ҁ0.3 SE
0.12 ⌬mmol/L per mmol/L, P 쏝 兩kh-t兩 ҃ 0.026, df 16, Tau 0.5
mmol/L).

It has been reported previously (7) that among these studies
differences occur between treatments with respect to intakes of
energy, protein, and available and unavailable carbohydrate, al-
though not fat. When these dietary components, together with
GI and GL, are used as covariates (Table 1), the regression
slope remains essentially unaltered at around – 0.3 ⌬mmol/L
per mmol/L (range – 0.26 to – 0.34). Such similar slopes
suggest that none of these dietary factors were sufficiently
determinant, either uniquely by themselves or collinearly, to
displace fasting blood glucose as an over-riding determinant
of the effect size in simple meta-regressions; that is regres-
sions not including interactive terms.

It was found that many interventions that intended to lower the
GI of a diet also resulted in increased intakes of unavailable
carbohydrates and varied intake of available carbohydrate caus-
ing usually a decreased GL. It is important to try to disentangle

FOOD, GLYCEMIA, AND HEALTH RISK

261S

GI diets and illustrates that the GL is as effective as the unavail-
able carbohydrate in lowering fasting blood glucose. Of the 15
studies in Figure 3 upper, no more than 3 reached 12 wk treatment
duration.

An assessment was made of whether, after accounting for
unavailable carbohydrate intake, the variation remaining in fast-
ing blood glucose reduction attributable to GL could be parti-
tioned between change in GI and change in available carbohy-
drate intake. Changes in GI in the range from Ҁ4 to Ҁ32 in these
studies were accompanied by a range for change in available
carbohydrates intake from ѿ 53 g/d to Ҁ35 g/d with a low
correlation between the 2 dietary measures (adjusted r2, Ҁ0.02);
this allowed a potentially good distinction between them. The
bivariate analysis of change in fasting blood glucose due to
change in GL showed no significant association for available
carbohydrate (P 쏜 兩kh-t兩 ҃ 0.54) while a strong association was
evident for GI (P 쏜 兩kh-t兩 ҃ 0.004). Thus it appears that GL is
better reduced by reduction in GI than by reduction in available
carbohydrate.

Further, observations (Table 2) indicate that the size of the
effects of GL or GI and unavailable carbohydrate is dependent on
the persons consuming the diet, that is their level of blood glucose
control (S, the severity of impairment); this is all important in
enabling any understanding of these studies.

Maximum control of fasting blood glucose was achieved by el-
evation of unavailable carbohydrate intake together with a lowering
of GI. Unavailable carbohydrate had stronger impact than GL on a
per g weight basis but remained approximately equally important
when taken together with the range of intakes (Figure 4 upper).

Glycated proteins

Twenty-eight studies reported on glycated protein concentra-
tions. Measures include glycated albumin, glycated plasma pro-
tein, fructosamine, and HbA1c. Subjects were categorized as

the effects of each of these. To understand the separate roles of
reduced GL of foods and increased unavailable carbohydrates
intake on fasting blood glucose, the interaction between these 2
variables and the severity (or impairment) of glycemic control
were studied. Severity (S) is quantified here by excessive fasting
blood glucose (S ҃ FBG – 5 mmol/L). In this more complex
model both interactions were significant (Table 2). Therefore
GL clearly has an effect independently of the unavailable carbo-
hydrate content of the diet. Likewise unavailable carbohydrates
appear to act independently of GL. Both act to control fasting
blood glucose as can be seen in Figure 3 (upper). This helps to
explain a reported variability in the effectiveness of the reduced

assess the potential implications of unavailable carbohydrate intake and
glycemic load on the fasting blood glucose values (Equation 2). The relative
fasting blood glucose concentrations were estimated independently of sever-
ity S (Equation 3). Thus, estimates (Equation 2) were calculated for all 9 (␣)
combinations of GL and UC shown in the figure. All 9 estimates were
expressed as a fraction of the central values at 15 g UC/d and 150 g (glucose
equivalents)/d GL.

prevailing glycated protein concentration (P ⬎ 兩X兩 ҃ 0.001). HbA1c, gly-
cated hemoglobin. Other abbreviations are as in Table 1.

for the 2 glycated protein types combined and for fructosamine
alone; for HbA1c alone, the effect is more probable than not
(Table 3). The effect appears greater after adjustment for the
half-life of fructosamine (2.5 wk) and HbA1c (4.5 wk). This is
because many of the studies are shorter in duration than the 3
half-lives necessary to avoid dilution of effect by the subjects
pretreatment diets (ie 쏝12 wk for HbA1c).

Variability in the effect of the lower GI/GL higher unavailable
carbohydrate diets on fructosamine, as with fasting blood glucose,
depended on the extent to which both the GI (and so GL) and the
unavailable carbohydrate intake varied (Table 2, Figure 4).

Again attempts were made to assess whether after accounting
for unavailable carbohydrate intake, the remaining variation at-
tributable to change in GL could be partitioned between GI and
available carbohydrate intake. For these studies, the change in GI
was in the range from Ҁ5 to Ҁ31 while the range of change in
available carbohydrates intakes (g/d) was from ѿ 43 to Ҁ40.
Although correlation between the 2 dietary measures was high
(r2-adjusted, 0.78) bivariate analysis resolved that any effect of
available carbohydrate intake was non-significant (P 쏝 兩kh-t兩 ҃
0.54) while GI has significant effect (P 쏝 兩kh-t兩 쏜0.03), a result
consistent with observations on fasting blood glucose. Hence
variation in fructosamine concentrations is contributed to in the
greater part by variations in unavailable carbohydrate intake and
GI (Figure 3 and 4 lower).

Altogether, the observations made imply optimum reduction
in fasting blood glucose and fructosamine occur with intakes of
unavailable carbohydrate at or above 25g/d (Figure 3 and 4), GL
at or below 100g (glucose equivalents) per d (Figure 3) or GI 쏝
45 (Figure 4). Of the 15 studies in Figure 3 and 4 on fasting blood
glucose and the 12 studies in Figure 3 and 4 concerning fruc-
tosamine, no more than 3 reached 12 wk treatment duration.

Fasting insulin

Eighteen relevant studies reported on fasting insulin concen-
trations. No treatment effects or meta-regression trends were
observed for concentrations 쏝 100 pmol/L in the totality of
evidence (Figure 6) or in end of study results whether for all
studies combined or by health type or body weight band (Table
4). Fasting insulin concentrations are difficult to interpret with-
out reference to corresponding fasting blood glucose concentra-
tions (25) and so the absence of change in insulin concentration
does not necessarily mean an absence of effect on insulin pro-
duction or effectiveness. Treatment effects on the insulin con-
centration may depend on hyperinsulinemia 쏜 100pmol/L (Fig-
ure 6, Table 4) which developed on the high GI/GL diets in a
small number of studies in some overweight or obese persons but
not all.

Insulin sensitivity

LIVESEY ET AL

Eighteen relevant studies either reported on insulin sensitivity
using a range of different methods, or provided postprandial
information from which this could be assessed. Among these
studies, observations were from healthy subjects (5 studies),
glucose intolerant subjects (2 studies), persons with type 1 dia-
betes (1 study), persons with type 2 diabetes (5 studies), and
subjects at risk of primary or secondary coronary heart disease (5
studies). The methods used included the euglycemic hyperinsu-
linemic clamp technique, the insulin tolerance test, the frequent
sampling intravenous glucose tolerance test, erythrocyte insulin
binding, and the inverse postprandial homeostatic model assess-
ment method (inverse HOMA PP). Some studies reported as-
sessments using more than one method. Some provided addi-
tional information from which the inverse HOMA PP was
calculable and others describe the sensitivity to insulin of glucose
consumption by human adipocytes in vitro. Fixed and random
effects meta-analyses for differences in insulin sensitivity
achieved by intervention expressed as a percentage of average
insulin sensitivity are summarized by health type, by body
weight band, by method of assessment, and by study duration
(Table 5). For all 18 studies combined, the lower glycemic,
variably higher unavailable carbohydrate intervention results in
a 20% improvement in insulin sensitivity (P 쏜 兩z兩 ҃ 0.004).

By subjects’ health type, improved insulin sensitivity was
statistically significant for 12 studies of nondiabetics combined
and for 5 studies on persons with type 2 diabetes combined.
Results for other health types were consistently increased al-
though did not reach statistical significance.

By body weight band, statistically significant increases in
insulin sensitivity are apparent for overweight subjects com-
bined (11 studies), obese subjects combined (3 studies) and both
these groups combined (14 studies). The mean increase for all
normal weight subjects combined (4 studies) suggests a poten-
tially sensitive response but it does not achieve statistical signif-
icance.

All methods of assessing insulin sensitivity yield combined
means that are positive toward improved sensitivity, and statis-
tically significant in some though not in others (Table 5). Com-
parison between methods is hampered by the occurrence of het-
erogeneity and the small number of studies. Most observations
were available for HOMA PP (8 studies) the combined mean for
which indicates a 30% improvement in insulin sensitivity of
glucose disposal in the postprandial state.

For all studies and methods combined (Table 5) the mean
improvement in studies of 쏝 and 욷 12 wk treatment duration was
similar at 20% and 16% respectively for a total of 14 and 4 studies
respectively, and with similar 95% CIs (앑0 to 35% each). The
larger number of studies in the short term indicate a significant
effect while over the longer term the effect appears more prob-
able than not.

Fasting plasma triacylglycerols

Thirty-two studies reported on fasting plasma triacylglycerol
concentrations. The observations were for healthy subjects (7
studies), persons with type 1 diabetes (4 studies), persons with
type 2 diabetes (13 studies), subjects at risk of primary CHD (4
studies), glucose intolerant subjects (1 study), and hyperlipid-
emic groups (1 study with 4 types). Six of the studies provide
repeated observations at various time points. The total evidence

Meta-regression indicates body weight to fall with reduction
in GL and vice versa (Table 7). The trend was statistically
significant for all studies combined and occurred in 2 of the 3
food intake control categories: ad libitum and limited controlled
intake but not in the controlled food intake category. Combining
the ad libitum and limited controlled food intake categories,
reductions in body weight occur when GL is reduced by at
least 17 SE 12 g eq./d (intercept on x-axis for y ҃ 0) and most
consistently when the reduction is by 쏜 42 g. eq./d (95%CI)
(Figure 9).

Among a number of dietary variables, differences in body
weight associates univariately most closely with treatment dif-
ferences in GL, though body weight differences also associate

fasting triacylglycerols were evident for lower GL (dependent on
GI) and higher fat intake (independent of GI).

After adjustment for variation in fat intake the effect of GL was
significant (P 쏜 兩kh-t兩 ҃ 0.014) among the 30 studies that in-
formed about both variables (fat and GL). This effect of GL was
significant in all studies combined and in all studies with subjects
in the normal range of body weight (Figure 8). Each health type
(healthy, type 1 and 2 diabetic and CHD risk) and body weight
band (normal, overweight, obese) contributed to varying extends
to the statistical significance found for all studies combined,
although each category alone was without statistically signifi-
cant effect. Over all a 10% fall in fasting triacylglycerols requires
achievement of a drop in GL by 30 to 100g eq./d for those
categories showing large or significant effects (Figure 8).

Body weight

Twenty-three relevant studies reported on body weight and

Among these studies, observations were on healthy subjects (4

DISCUSSION

Low glycemic response diets are proposed as a means to fa-
vorably influence physiologic parameters implicated as markers
for conditions including overweight and obesity, diabetes mel-
litus and risk of coronary heart disease. The present meta-
analyses provide evidence that supports the view that interven-
tion to reduce the diets glycemic impact will favorably affect
several health risk markers.

For individuals with fasting blood glucose concentrations in
excess of 5 mmol/L, there is evidence that fasting blood glucose
is reduced by the consumption of lower GI or GL. Higher un-
available carbohydrate has an effect that is additive to that of
lower GI (and resulting GL), ie both together have optimum

effect. Further, the evidence indicates that the effect of consum-
ing lower GI and higher UC diets is greater in absolute units in
persons with poorer control of blood glucose, including persons
with both type 1 and type 2 diabetes.

Similarly, for individuals with fasting blood glucose concen-
trations in excess of 5 mmol/L, there is evidence that both lower
GI (and so lower GL) and higher UC in diets reduce the levels of
glycated proteins. The evidence is stronger for fructosamine than
for glycated hemoglobin. Again, the size of the effect is greater
in persons with poorer control over blood glucose.

Although the data suggest that the consumption of lower GI/
GL, higher unavailable carbohydrate diets lead to a reduction in
fasting insulin concentrations in overweight or obese individuals
who had fasting concentrations 쏜 100 pmol/L, the evidence is
weak due to few studies. In individuals with fasting insulin levels
쏝 100 pmol/L, meta-analysis provides evidence of no significant
effect.

Overall, this review provides evidence that insulin sensitivity
is improved by consumption of lower GI/GL, higher unavailable
carbohydrate diets. Although the increase is evident in all body
weight bands combined, and in nondiabetics, the increase is not
shown to be statistically significant in subjects in the normal
body weight range.

While a simple meta-analysis of interventions with low GI/
GL, variably higher unavailable carbohydrate diets did not pro-
vide a combined mean effect on fasting triacylglycerol concen-
trations, a more sophisticated analysis suggests an apparent
absence of effect is due to a confounding factor. After adjustment
for fat intake unrelated to GI or load (7), the evidence shows
reductions in GL to reduce fasting triacylglycerols.

Over all studies relevant for the purpose taken together, it is
evident that intervention with low GI/GL, high unavailable car-
bohydrate diets do associate significantly with reductions in
body weight. Such evidence is consistent with evidence on re-
ductions in food energy intake (7). The present analysis suggests
a minimal reduction in GL or index is necessary for this effect to
occur (Figure 9 and Table 8 in ref. 7). This could arise either
because a threshold needs to be surpassed to achieve an effect or

FOOD, GLYCEMIA, AND HEALTH RISK

because dietary advice is imprecisely implemented by the re-
searchers, health professionals, and consumers involved.

Although the evidence generally supports the view that inter-
vention with a low GI/GL and higher unavailable carbohydrate
diet is associated with favorable changes in a number of health
risk markers relevant to persons who are overweight, obese,
diabetic or at risk of coronary heart disease, the evidence also
indicates for some markers that not all subjects respond equally.
For reductions in fasting blood glucose concentrations and gly-
cated proteins, there is evidence that the effects are greatest
among those with poorest glycemic control. For reduction in
fasting blood glucose, the threshold for this effect is at about 5
mmol/L. For glycated proteins the threshold is at about 3.5 glu-
cose mmol/L. Unpublished meta-analysis of the effect of the low
GI sugar fructose indicates a threshold of effect on glycated
hemoglobin at about 4% HbA1c (Livesey and Taylor, unpub-
lished observations, 2007). Hence absence of effect in those with
good glycemic control is not evident. Also, when fasting glucose
is low (쏝5 mmol/L) and study precision is accounted for, then
below median normal fasting blood glucose is elevated to a small
but statistically significant extent by such diets (in which case the
‘threshold’ mentioned above is a pivot point). The evidence for
a small rise in fasting glucose below 5mmol/L comes with evi-
dence of publication bias consistent with hesitance to report such
normalization. While the present data taken together with influ-
ence on insulin sensitivity points toward improved control
among nondiabetics (in addition to persons with diabetes), a role
in disease prevention remains to be established.

The studies reviewed had the intention to treat by reducing the
GI of available carbohydrate ingested. Compliant treatments
show variable elevations in unavailable carbohydrate and protein
intake and reductions in available carbohydrate, metabolizable
energy, and GL when food intake was not firmly controlled (7).
Even when intake was controlled the reductions in GI were ac-
companied by significant reductions in available carbohydrate
intake and so in GL (7). However, among the health markers
examined 3 factors were clearly important, glycaemic index,
available carbohydrate intake and unavailable carbohydrate in-
take. Altogether, improvement in the control of health markers
cannot be said to be clearly due to GI alone.

Overall, considering all the markers of health examined here
together, it is difficult to establish whether GI is stronger than GL,
in part due to their co-linearity (7) and in part because some
markers appear affected by available carbohydrate intake while
others are not. While there is no affirmative evidence that vari-
ation in available carbohydrate intake (앐 50g/d) influences fast-
ing blood glucose or glycated proteins in these studies, there is
evidence that reductions in available carbohydrate intake do ac-
company or play a role alongside GI in the beneficial effects of
lower GL on fasting triacylglycerols (herein), body weight
(herein) and food intake (7). On the other hand, it must also be
considered that limiting harm due to glycaemic load by attempts
to lower available carbohydrate intake will risk elevating harm
from higher total or saturated fat intake. Benefits of reduction in
available carbohydrate intake would be expected only in a con-
text of no increase in total or saturated fat intake. It is evident in
the studies reviewed here that lower available carbohydrate in-
take following marked reductions in glycaemic index were not
accompanied by elevation in fat intake (7). In this context, the
balance favors reduced harm.

The meta-analyses confirm that GI or load has a significantly
stronger relation with glycemic control than does available car-
bohydrate in the present context in which change in fat intake is
minimal. Attaining an optimum diet for health therefore requires
consideration of glycemic impact of foods eaten in preference to
consideration of carbohydrate content alone, each in the context
of a balanced diet meeting nutrient requirements. The extent to
which reduction in GL using ingredient carbohydrates has sim-
ilar effects to those in the studies reviewed requires to be more
fully evaluated. Fructose appears at least equally effective for
HbA1c control (Livesey and Taylor, unpublished observations,
2007) and added unavailable carbohydrate can be effective in
glycemic control (8, 26, 27).

The evidence shows also that, independently of increasing
unavailable carbohydrate intake, reductions in GI (and so GL) do
improve glycemic control. For optimal control over fasting blood
glucose concentrations in persons with diabetes, the evidence
points toward the need for foods that are of low impact on gly-
cemia (independently of fat intake) and foods that are high in
unavailable carbohydrate. Diets that achieve one without the
other would be suboptimal for diabetes control.

Abstract

Aims/hypothesis. Insulin resistance usually precedes
the diagnosis of Type II (non-insulin-dependent) dia-
betes mellitus. However, in most patients, the clinical
expression of the disease could be prevented by di-
etary and lifestyle changes. We investigated the ef-
fects of a diet enriched in monounsaturated fatty ac-
ids (Mediterranean diet) and a low fat, high-carbohy-
drate diet on in vivo and in vitro glucose metabolism
in 59 young subjects (30 men and 29 women).
Methods. We carried out an intervention dietary
study with a saturated fat phase and two random-
ized-crossover dietary periods: a high-carbohydrate
diet and a Mediterranean diet for 28 days each. We
analysed the plasma lipoproteins fractions, free fatty
acids, insulin sensitivity and glucose uptake in isolat-
ed monocytes at the end of the three dietary periods.
Results. In comparison to the saturated fat diet, the
CHO and Mediterranean diets induced a decrease of
LDL-cholesterol (p < 0.001) and HDL-cholesterol
(p < 0.001). Steady-state plasma glucose decreased

(p = 0.023) and basal and insulin-stimulated 2-deoxi-
glucose uptake in peripheral monocytes increased in
both diets (CHO and Mediterranean), (p = 0.007) in-
dicating an improvement in insulin sensitivity. Fast-
ing free fatty acids plasma values were correlated
positively with steady state plasma glucose (r = 0.45;
p < 0.0001). In addition, there was an inverse correla-
tion between the mean glucose of the steady state
plasma glucose period and logarithmic values of basal
(r = ±0.34; p = 0.003) and insulin stimulated glucose
uptake in monocytes (r = ±0.32; p = 0.006).
Conclusion/interpretation. Isocaloric substitution of
carbohydrates and monounsaturated fatty acids for
saturated fatty acids improved insulin sensitivity in
vivo and in vitro, with an increase in glucose disposal.
Both diets are an adequate alternatives for improving
glucose metabolism in healthy young men and wom-

nary heart disease (CHD). In 1988 ªSyndrome Xº
was [1] first described as a cluster of pathophysiologic
phenomena including insulin resistance, glucose in-
tolerance, dyslipidemia, and abdominal obesity.

The relation between diet and chronic disease is
well established, although there is debate over the de-
tails of this relation. In general, high intakes of di-
etary fat have been associated with obesity and its co-
morbid conditions, including heart disease and diabe-
tes [2]. All these factors are related to the globaliza-
tion of the ªWesternº lifestyle and dietary habits. In-
sulin resistance usually precedes the diagnosis of
Type II (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus by

decades and in most cases, the clinical expression of
the disease could be prevented by dietary and life-
style modification. A diet high in fiber, low in saturat-
ed fatty acids (SFA) and low in simple carbohydrates
(CHO) is accepted as beneficial for patients with
Type II diabetes mellitus and CHD. However, there
is still some debate over whether the best source of
replacement calories for SFA fat comes from mono-
unsaturated (MONO) fats or from complex CHO. In
a recent meta-analysis of ten randomized-crossover
trials using isocaloric diets, it was concluded that
high-MONO fat diets might be more advantageous
than high CHO-diets for improving lipoprotein and
glycaemic profiles in patients with Type II diabetes
[3]. Furthermore, the high intakes of oleic acid in the
Mediterranean region coincide with low rates of total
mortality and CHD [4]. Insulin resistance and its clin-
ical expression as Type II diabetes mellitus is proba-
bly influenced and determined by diet in the early
stages of growth and development. However, few
studies have addressed the effect of both high-CHO
and high-MONO fat diets on glucose metabolism in
non-diabetic subjects using well-controlled crossover
randomized dietary intervention protocols. We con-
ducted this study to investigate the effects of the iso-
caloric substitution of CHO and monounsaturated
fatty acids (MUFA) for SFA fat, on in vivo and in vit-
ro glucose metabolism, using the insulin suppression
test and glucose disposal in peripheral monocytes ob-
tained after each dietary period.

Subjects and methods

Subjects and diets. Fifty-nine healthy normolipemic (total plas-
ma cholesterol values lower than 5.2 mmol/l) subjects (30 men
and 29 women), attending the University of Cordoba volun-
teered to participate in the study. All underwent a comprehen-
sive medical history, physical examination and clinical chemis-
try analyses before enrollment. Subjects were younger than
30 years of age (mean age 23.1  1.8), with no evidence of any
chronic illness (such as hepatic, renal, thyroid, or cardiac dys-
function), or unusually high values of physical activity. Mean
initial BMI was 22.87  2.45 and remained constant through-
out
the experimental period. Mean basal weight was
67.01  11.5. This weight was not modified at the end of each
dietary period (66.35  11.6; 66.24  11.0 and 66.34  11.3, in
saturated diet, CHO-diet and Mediterranean diet, respective-
ly).

Dietary information, including alcohol consumption, was
collected over seven consecutive days. Individual energy re-
quirements were calculated by taking into consideration each
participant's weight and physical activity. The participants
were encouraged to maintain their regular physical activity
and lifestyle and were asked to record any event that could af-
fect the outcome of the study in a diary, such as stress, change
in smoking habits and alcohol consumption or foods not in-
cluded in the experimental design.

The study design included an initial 28-day period during
which all the subjects consumed a saturated fat (SFA) enriched
diet with 15 % of energy as protein, 47 % as carbohydrate

(CHO), and 38 % as fat [20 % SFA, 12 % monounsaturated
fatty acids (MUFA) and 6 % polyunsaturated fatty acids
(PUFA)]. All participants were then randomized in a cross-
over design and exposed to two new dietary periods: a low fat,
high carbohydrates diet (CHO-diet), and a high-MUFA diet,
with a typical ªMediterranean dietº enriched with olive oil.
The two groups of subjects were assigned to one of two dietary
regimes for 28 days each. Group 1 (30 subjects) was placed on
a Mediterranean diet followed by a CHO-diet. For group 2
(29 subjects) the order was reversed. Assignment of volunteers
to the sequence of diets was carried out at random. The CHO-
diet [5] contained 15 % of energy as protein, 57 % as CHO, and
28 % as fat ( < 10 % SFA, 12 % MUFA, and 6 % PUFA). The
MUFA-enriched diet contained 15 % of energy as protein,
47 % as CHO, and 38 % as fat ( < 10 % SFA, 22 % MUFA,
and 6 % PUFA). Olive oil provided 75 % of total MUFA con-
sumed during this last dietary period. All diets lasted for
28 days. Dietary cholesterol remained constant in our experi-
mental design and the mean cholesterol intake was 115 mg/
1000 kcal during the three periods. The Human Investigation
Review Committee approved this study at the Reina Sofia
University Hospital. Informed consent was obtained from all
participants.

The composition of the experimental diets was calculated
using the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)
food tables or the Spanish food composition tables for local
foodstuffs. Fourteen menus were prepared with regular solid
foods and rotated during the experimental period. We used vir-
gin olive oil for cooking and as a salad dressing during the
Mediterranean diet. Palm oil and butter were used for the
high-SFA diet. During the CHO-diet period, biscuits, bread
and jam replaced some olive oil or palm oil. Lunch and dinner
were consumed in the hospital dining room, whereas breakfast
and an afternoon coffee break were taken in the medical
school cafeteria. A dietitian supervised all meals. Duplicate
samples from each menu were collected, homogenized, and
stored at ±80 C. Protein, fat and CHO content of the diet
were analysed using standard methods [6]. Dietary compliance
was also evaluated by examining the food diaries and by anal-
ysing the fatty acid content of the cholesterol ester fraction in
LDL [7].

Blood sampling and biochemical determinations. Venous blood
for insulin, glucose, lipid and lipoprotein analysis were collect-
ed in EDTA containing tubes from the subjects after a 12-h
overnight fast at the end of each dietary period. Each analysis
was done three times. Cholesterol (TC) and triglycerides were
assayed by enzymatic procedures [8, 9]. HDL-C was measured
by analysing the supernatant obtained after precipitation of a
plasma aliquot with dextran sulfate-Mg2+ [10]. LDL-C values
were calculated from the total cholesterol, triglycerides, and
HDL-C values using the Friedewald formula [11]. Unesterified
free fatty acid values were analysed by an enzymatic colori-
metric assay (Boehringer Mannheim, Mannheim, Gemanny)
[12]. To reduce interassay variation, plasma for biochemical
determinations was stored at ±80 C and analysed in duplicate
at the end of the study.

Glucose suppression test. At the end of each dietary period all
subjects underwent a modified insulin suppression test [13,
14]. The study began at 0800 hours, after twelve hours of fast-
ing. A continuous infusion of somatostatin (214 nmol/h), insu-
lin (180 pmol ´ m±2 ´ min±1), and glucose (13.2 mmol ´ m±2 ´
min±1) were infused in the same vein. Somatostatin was used
to inhibit endogenous insulin secretion. Blood was sampled ev-
ery 30 min for the first 2.5 h, by which time steady state plasma
glucose (SSPG) and steady-state plasma insulin (SSPI) values

2040

were achieved. Blood was then sampled at 10-minute intervals
for the last 30 min (at 150, 160, 170 and 180 min) to measure
plasma glucose and insulin concentrations. These four values
determined the SSPG and SSPI concentrations. Since SSPI
values were similar in all subjects, SSPG values provided a
measure of the ability of insulin to promote disposal of infused
glucose. Subjects with high SSPG are relatively more insulin
resistant than subjects with lower SSPG.

Separation of circulating monocytes. Circulating mononuclear
cells were separated by the Ficoll-Hypaque procedure. Mono-
nuclear cells collected from the interface were washed twice
by centrifugation at 230 ´ g for 10 min to remove the remaining
Ficoll-Hypaque and in 6 ml of HEPES-buffered RPMI culture
medium by centrifugation at 100 ´ g for 5 min to remove con-
taminating platelets and to obtain the mononuclear cell popu-
lation. Monocytes were separated by adherence to 24-well
plates by incubation with HEPES-RPMI medium containing
10 % bovine calf serum at 370 C for 4 h. Monocytes adhered
to the bottom of the wells, whereas lymphocytes remained in
the supernatant. The cells were maintained at room tempera-
ture for less than 3 h until assayed for 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG)
uptake. (3H)2-DG was obtained from Amersham Life Science
(Piscataway, N. J., USA) and unlabelled 2-DG from Sigma
(St. Louis, Mo., USA).

Glucose uptake in monocytes. Glucose uptake in monocytes
was carried out as described previously [15]. In summary,
monocytes were resuspended in glucose-free HEPES-buffered
saline solution and incubated in the presence of 75 mmol/l
(3H)2-DG (sp. act 156 mCi/mmol) at 37 C with mild agitation.
Uptake was stopped by adding 50 ml glucose-free HEPES-buf-
fered solution containing 10 mmol/l cytochalasin B (Sigma).
The cells were quickly separated from the radioactive solution
and lysed by adding 400 ml 0.05 N NaOH, and cell-associated
radioactivity was analysed by scintillation counting. Parallel
determination of control hexose uptake were done in the pres-
ence of 25 mmol/l cytochalasin B and the radioactivity associat-
ed with these cell pellets was subtracted from all the results.
Each measurement was done at least twice. 2-DG uptake was
analysed both in the absence (basal glucose uptake) and pres-
ence (insulin-stimulated glucose uptake) of insulin by incubat-
ing the cells for 1 h respectively, without or with 10 nmol/l insu-
lin, at 370 C in HEPES-buffered RPMI medium.

Statistical analyses. Statistical analyses were carried out using
the SPSS statistical package. ANOVA for repeated measures
was used to analyse the differences in plasma lipid, glucose,
SSPG values and basal glucose and insulin-stimulated glucose
uptake between dietary phases. When statistically significant
effects were observed, Tukey's post-hoc test was used to identi-
fy differences between groups. Correlation analysis was done
with Pearson's correlation coefficient. A p value of less than
0.05 was considered statistically significant. All data are given
in the text and tables as means  SD.

Results

Dietary composition was analysed in duplicate meal
portions. Results are shown in Table 1. The results
were in close agreement with values obtained from
the food composition tables. Fatty acid composition
was analysed during each dietary period on the cho-
lesterol ester fraction of plasma LDL (Table 2). En-

of insulin and non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) were
significantly higher during the high-SFA diet than
during the CHO and Mediterranean diets (Table 3).
Insulin values during the SSPI period (mean  SD in
min 150, 160, 170 and 180 of insulin suppression test)
were similar after the three diets (100.1  30.5,

er during both the Mediterranean and CHO-diets
compared with the high-SFA diet (p = 0.007); indicat-
ing an improvement in insulin sensitivity (Table 3).
No differences were found between the CHO or the
Mediterranean diet or between men and women
(data not shown). The mean glucose values of the
SSPG period changed in parallel with fasting NEFA
plasma values (Table 3), indicating the characteristic
relation between insulin sensitivity and NEFA plas-
ma values. Furthermore, the NEFA plasma values
were correlated positively with SSPG (r = 0.45;
p < 0.0001; Fig. 1). The basal and insulin-stimulated
glucose uptake of 2-deoxiglucose in peripheral mono-
cytes, obtained during each dietary period, increased
after the Mediterranean (p < 0.001) and CHO diets
(p < 0.001) compared with the high-SFA diet, parallel
to the changes in in vivo glucose disposal (Table 3).
Additionally, there was a significantly inverse corre-
lation between the mean glucose of the SSPG period
and logarithmic values of basal and insulin stimulated
glucose uptake in monocytes (basal uptake r = ±0.34;

Discussion

Our data show that the isocaloric substitution of
CHO or MUFA in an enriched Mediterranean diet
for SFA in a young healthy normolipemic population,
improves in vivo insulin sensitivity found with the in-
sulin suppression test. We also found an increase in
in vitro glucose uptake by monocytes obtained during
a Mediterranean diet and the CHO-diet. These find-
ings were positively correlated with in vivo glucose
disposal. These data have been obtained in free living
conditions using natural food, thus increasing the
generalization of our findings.

Reduction in SFA fat intake improves insulin sen-
sitivity in patients with Type II diabetes [16, 17] and
agrees with our results in healthy subjects. However,
debate continues as to whether dietary SFA should
be replaced with CHO or MUFA. Our data indicate
that CHO and Mediterranean diets are equally effec-
tive at promoting in vivo disposal of glucose, since
both diets showed a similar decrease in SSPG.

It is important to stress that the three diets in our
study contained the same fiber content. Although
studies exist which demonstrate that an increase in
carbohydrates, without an increase in fiber, does not
improve glucose metabolism [18] a recent study
showed that diets with different carbohydrate con-
tent but with an equal content of fiber, improve glu-
cose metabolism [19]. The putative basic defect in
Type II diabetes and in metabolic syndrome is the re-
sistance to insulin-mediated glucose disposal, which
favors fasting and postprandial hyperinsulinaemia.
Insulin response to nutrient intake increases in rela-
tion to the amount of dietary CHO [20]. If CHO in-
take is increased, an additional amount of insulin

2042

F. PØrez-JimØnez et al.: Glucose metabolism and dietary fat content

must be secreted in order to maintain glucose homeo-
stasis. When insulin resistance progresses, the diffi-
culty of the pancreas to produce additional insulin
will impair glucose metabolism, as has been shown
in Type II diabetic patients. However, if the pancreas
can respond with sufficient hormone secretion, as in
our healthy subjects, plasma glucose could be main-
tained within normal values and fasting insulinaemia
and peripheral sensitivity should remain within nor-
mal limits [21]. It has been suggested [3] that im-
provement in the glycaemic profile of diabetic pa-
tients with a high-MONO diet, compared with a
high-CHO diet, might not be related to changes in in-
sulin sensitivity but rather to a reduction in the carbo-
hydrate load, which Type II diabetic patients might
not be able to readily handle. This could explain the
discrepancies found between our data in healthy sub-
jects with adequate insulin secretion and data from
studies which include Type II diabetic patients.

Of interest, we found that fasting NEFA plasma
values decreased after isocaloric replacement of
MUFA and CHO for SFA. Furthermore, the mean
value of SSPG as an index of glucose uptake, corre-
lated positively with NEFA plasma values. Non-es-
terified fatty acid plasma values are typically in-
creased in insulin resistant states. Several decades
ago it was proposed [22] that high values of fatty acids
could play a causal role in the development of insulin
resistance by competing with glucose for oxidation
[23, 24].

The in vitro basal and insulin-stimulated glucose
uptake increased during the isocaloric substitution of
MUFA and CHO for SFA fat, thus confirming the
findings observed for the in vivo studies. Skeletal
muscle is the most important site of peripheral insulin
resistance [25] but this tissue is relatively inaccessible
for routine evaluation of insulin action in humans.
Mononuclear cells are not a typical insulin target tis-
sue but they do have the advantage of being the only
easily accessible human cell system available to study
insulin action at the cellular level [26]. 2-DG uptake
represents hexose transport and glucose uptake in
isolated monocytes has been previously shown to re-
spond to insulin in a dose-dependent manner [15].
The current in vitro model has been previously shown
to have an abnormally low basal and insulin-stimulat-
ed glucose uptake in cells from Type II diabetic pa-
tients. These cells have glucose metabolism-related
enzyme activity comparable to the activity in typical
insulin target tissues [27]. Moreover, they exhibit the
insulin activation of receptor kinase, with impairment
of this activation in intact cells from patients with
Type II diabetic patients [26]. This evidence suggests
that peripheral monocytes could serve as an indirect
model system to assess impaired peripheral insulin
action in Type II diabetes and to investigate in vitro
insulin sensitivity [28]. The relation between in vivo
and in vitro glucose disposal was shown by the fact

that in vitro 2-DG uptake correlated negatively with
mean glucose in the last half-hour of the insulin sup-
pression test.

In summary, our findings suggest that both the
Mediterranean diet and the low-fat, high-CHO diet
improve insulin sensitivity in vivo and in vitro, in
healthy subjects and could help prevent Type II dia-
betes mellitus.

Key words: gastric emptying, blood glucose, healthy subjects, oat, ␤-glucan, satiety

Objective: Products enriched with oat ␤-glucan have been shown to reduce postprandial glucose and
insulinemic responses. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of an extruded muesli product based on
oat ␤-glucan on the rate of gastric emptying, postprandial blood glucose and satiety in healthy subjects.

Methods: Gastric emptying rate (GER) was measured by standardized real-time ultrasonography. Twelve
healthy subjects were assessed using a randomized crossover double blind trial. The meals were administered
after 8 hours’ fasting after measuring the subject’s normal fasting blood glucose level. Blood glucose measure-
ments were made before, 30 and 60 min after the end of the meal. Satiety scores were estimated 15 and 90 min
after the end of the meal. The GER was calculated as the percentage change in the antral cross-sectional area 15
and 90 minutes after ingestion of vanilla yoghurt with muesli containing 4 g oat ␤-glucan (GER1) or vanilla
yoghurt with muesli containing cornflakes (GER2).

Results: The median values were 60% for GER1 and 44% for GER2. The effect of 4 g oat ␤-glucan on the
rate of gastric emptying was not statistically significant compared with corn flakes. Muesli with 4 g oat ␤-glucan
lowered the postprandial glucose response significantly compared to the cornflakes meal (p ⫽ 0.045). The effect
of oat ␤-glucan on satiety was not statistically significantly.

Conclusions: The results of this study suggest that intake of muesli with 4 g oat ␤-glucan does not affect
the gastric emptying rate or satiety but lowers the postprandial blood glucose response, indicating that the GER
does not regulate the blood glucose level.

INTRODUCTION

The incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus is increasing
rapidly worldwide. To prevent the development of diabetes
mellitus, the American Diabetes Association recommends a
reduction in caloric intake and increased consumption of di-
etary fiber and food containing whole grain [1]. Low-glycemic-
index (GI) food that reduces postprandial hyperglycemia is
recommended, but it is unclear whether it prevents diabetes
mellitus [2– 8]. A low-GI diet can be recommended to control
glycemia in patients with diabetes [9 –10]. Products enriched

with oat ␤-glucan have been shown to reduce postprandial
glucose and insulinemic responses in healthy subjects [11–14]
and in type 2 diabetes patients [15–17]. Another advantageous
effect of oat ␤-glucans is a reduction in total cholesterol [12].
The oat ␤-glucan effect is, however, not fully understood.
One hypothesis is that oat ␤-glucan increases the viscosity in
the small intestine and delays the digestion of food, leading to
lower blood glucose and insulin response. Another mechanism
that has been discussed is that oat ␤-glucan may delay gastric
emptying caused by the viscosity of the fibre causing distention
of the stomach. Only one study has been performed previously

on the effect of ␤-glucan on gastric emptying rate (GER), using
rye bread, and paracetamol as a marker for gastric emptying
[18]. In that study, it was found that the GER in healthy
subjects was not affected after a meal consisting of rye bread
with ␤-glucan. However, the individual pharmacokinetics of
paracetamol varies [19], which may reduce the agreement
between serum paracetamol and rate of GER [20]. Gastric
emptying, among other factors, regulates the postprandial
blood glucose response, and a delay leads to a lower postpran-
dial blood glucose level [21,22]. Therefore, this study was
designed to determine whether there is a delay in gastric
emptying in healthy subjects, affecting postprandial blood glu-
cose levels and satiety, after consumption of oat ␤-glucan.

MATERIAL AND METHODS

Twelve healthy subjects, eight men and four women; mean age
27 ⫾ 5 years [range 22–35 years]; mean BMI 22 ⫾ 3 kg/m2
[range 17.0–27.0 kg/m2], without symptoms or a prior history of
gastrointestinal disease, abdominal surgery or diabetes mellitus,
were included in the study. The subjects were not taking any
medication, except for one of the women who was taking oral
contraceptives. All subjects were recruited from the population in
a southern county of Sweden. The study started 2003-04-01 and
ended 2004-01-01. Four of the subjects were smokers and two
were snuff users. The subjects were examined between 8:00 and
10:00 a.m. after 8 hours’ fasting. Smoking and snuff-taking were
prohibited for 8 h before the test as well as during the test. Each
subject was required to have a normal fasting blood glucose level
on the day of the study. The mean fasting blood glucose levels
before ingestion of the muesli with ␤-glucan were 4.6 ⫾ 0.5
mmol/l [range 4.0–5.4 mmol/l] and were 4.6 ⫾ 0.4 mmol/l [range
4.0–5.0 mmol/l] before ingestion of the reference meal, respec-
tively. If a subject showed gastrointestinal tract symptoms (diar-
rhea or constipation) the study was postponed.

The test meal (total caloric value 209 kcal) consisted of 200 g
vanilla yoghurt (caloric value 137 kcal) and 26.5 g Primaliv muesli
(Skånemejerier, Malmo¨, Sweden) (caloric value 72 kcal). The
Primaliv muesli was composed of 24.5 g flakes made from oat
bran (OatWell, Swedish Oat Fibre/Crea Nutrition, Va¨ro¨backa,
Sweden) containing 4 g oat ␤-glucan (caloric value 65 kcal), 0.8 g
mini-cornflakes (caloric value 3 kcal), 0.6 g freeze-dried apple

(caloric value 2 kcal) and 0.6 g freeze-dried strawberries (caloric
value 2 kcal), (Table 1). The reference meal included the same
brand and quantity of vanilla yoghurt, mini-cornflakes, apple and
strawberries as the test meal, but the oat bran flakes were replaced
with 17.5 g Kellogg’s cornflakes (Nordisk Kellogg’s, Upplands
Va¨sby, Sweden) (caloric value 65 kcal) (Table 1). The test meal
and the reference meal had the same total caloric value. Water
(200 ml) was served with each meal and was ingested gradually
during the meal, which lasted for 10 min. The meals were served
in a random order. A randomization techniques such as random
number drawing was used

The GER was estimated using a previously described standard-
ized ultrasound method [23]. The sonographic examination was
performed using a 3.5 MHz abdominal transducer and an Acuson
128 XP 10 ultrasound system (Siemens Medical Solutions, Moun-
tain View, CA, USA). Measurements of the gastric antrum were
performed by the same radiologist who was blinded with regard to
the meals. At each observation of the gastric antrum the abdominal
aorta and the left lobe of the liver were used as internal landmarks.
The subjects were examined in supine position, but sat between
examinations. Measurements were made 15 and 90 minutes after
the end of the meal. The GER was expressed as the percentage
change in the antral cross-sectional area between 15 and 90 min.
Three measurements of the longitudinal (d1) and anteroposterior
(d2) diameters were made at each examination, and the mean
value was used to calculate the cross-sectional area of the gastric
antrum, using the following equation:

Antrumarea ⫽ ␲⫻ r2 ⫽ ␲⫻ d1/2 ⫻ d2/2 ⫽ ␲⫻ d1 ⫻ d2/4

The GER was calculated using the following expression:

Finger-prick capillary blood samples were taken before, 30 and
60 min after the end of the meal to measure blood glucose. Blood
glucose concentrations were measured with a HemoCue Glucose
system (HemoCue AB, A¨ ngelholm, Sweden). Satiety was esti-
mated using a validated numerical satiety scale, according to the
method of Haber et al., based on a scoring system with grades
from ⫺10 cm (extreme hunger) to ⫹10 cm (extreme satiety) [24].
Satiety scores were estimated 15 and 90 min after the end of the

ration and approved by the Ethics Committee of Lund University.
All subjects provided written informed consent. Power calculation
was required by the Ethics Committee of Lund University and
done before the study. Paired t-test power calculations showed a
71% power to detect a 20% change in GER.

Median values with quartiles (q1 to q3) are presented for the
antral cross-sectional areas and the GER. Delta values of blood
glucose levels were calculated as the difference between blood
glucose levels before the meal (fasting value) and 30 and 60
min after the end of the meal. The change in satiety was
calculated 15 and 90 min after the end of the meal. The change
in satiety was determined for each subject, and the results are
presented as the mean ⫾ SEMs for the whole group (n ⫽ 12).
The blood glucose was determined from the areas under the
curves (AUCs), using the area above zero, for each subject
(Graph Pad PRISM, version 4, San Diego). These values are
presented as the mean ⫾ SEM for the whole group. All statis-
tical calculations were performed using SPSS for Windows
(version 14.0, 2005). Differences in the GER, gastric antral
cross-sectional area, change satiety scores and blood glucose
levels were evaluated with the Wilcoxon signed rank test.
Values of p ⬍ 0.05 were considered significant.

RESULTS

Postprandial Blood Glucose Response

The blood glucose levels at 30 min and the AUC (0 –30)
min were significantly lower after the ingestion of muesli with

4 g oat ␤-glucan than muesli with cornflakes (p ⫽ 0.045) (Fig.
1, Table 2). However, the glucose levels at 60 min and the AUC
(0 – 60) min did not differ significantly between the muesli with
oat ␤-glucan and the muesli with cornflakes (Table 2).

GER

The median values of the antral cross-sectional area after
ingestion of the muesli with ␤-glucan were 577 mm2 (q1 ⫽ 415
mm2, q3 ⫽ 859 mm2) and 213 mm2 (q1 ⫽ 185 mm2, q3 ⫽ 326
mm2) 15 and 90 min after the end of the study meal, respec-
tively. The median values of the antral cross-sectional area in
the same subjects after the ingestion of the meal containing
cornflakes were 660 mm2 (q1 ⫽ 507 mm2, q2 ⫽ 960 mm2) and
382 mm2 (q1 ⫽ 208 mm2, q3 ⫽ 593 mm2) 15 and 90 min after
the end of the meal, respectively. The median gastric antral
cross-sectional areas were significantly larger after ingestion of
the muesli with cornflakes than after the ingestion of the muesli
with oat bran flakes containing 4 g ␤-glucan at 15 min (p ⫽
0.004). However, there was no significant difference between
gastric antral cross-sectional areas at 90 min. The median value
of the GER after the meal with 4 g ␤-glucan was estimated to
be 60% (q1 ⫽ 48%, q3 ⫽ 72%), while the corresponding
values after the meal with cornflakes was estimated to be 44%
(q1 ⫽ 5%, q3 ⫽ 67%). This difference was not significant
(Fig. 2).

Satiety

The mean change in satiety after the ingestion of muesli
with 4 g ␤-glucan was 2.7 ⫾ 0.9 cm (range 0 –10 cm); the
corresponding values after the ingestion of muesli with corn-
flakes were 3.2 ⫾ 0.5 (range 0 – 6 cm). Thus, the ingestion of
muesli with 4 g ␤-glucan did not result in a significantly
prolonged period of satiety compared to the reference meal, i.e.
muesli with cornflakes.

DISCUSSION

This study was designed to evaluate the effect of oat ␤-glu-
can on the GER. The results suggest that the presence of 4 g of

Oat B-Glucan, Gastric Emptying and Blood Glucose

Fig. 2. Gastric emptying of yoghurt with muesli containing oat flakes (␤-glucan) or cornflakes, estimated as gastric emptying rate (GER), in twelve
healthy subjects. The GER is expressed as the percentage change in the antral cross-sectional area between 15 and 90 min. The median, minimum
(Min), and maximum (Max) values and the values of the first (q1) and the third (q3) quartiles are shown. There were no significant differences between
the GERs.

oat ␤-glucan in a semisolid meal does not significantly affect
the GER or the satiety in healthy subjects. Thus, the reduction
in postprandial glucose response after the 4 g oat ␤-glucan meal
in healthy subjects could not be explained by delayed GER.
The median antrum area 15 min after the intake of the meal
containing Kellogg’s cornflakes was significantly larger than
the 15 min antrum area after the intake of the meal containing
␤-glucan. This is probably due to the larger volume of the
cornflakes than the oat bran flakes. The antrum area at 90 min
and the GER after the meals were not significantly different.
The negative value of GER is caused by an increased gastric
antral cross-sectional area at 90 min and this could be due to
increased amount of gastric juices and saliva in the stomach. It
is known that an increased caloric value of a meal can delay the
GER [25]. Therefore, the total caloric values of the meals were
the same, but not
the carbohydrate load. The meals were
composed of commercial products and not our own manufac-
tured test meals. We found a significantly lower blood glucose
level 30 min after the end of the of the oat ␤-glucan meal than
after the cornflakes meal. However, we found no significant
difference between the meals regarding blood glucose 60 min
after the end of the meals. The reduced postprandial blood
glucose seen after ingesting the muesli containing 4 g oat
␤-glucan could therefore be due to a reduced glycemic load
compared to the muesli with cornflakes. Unfortunately, we did
not measure the blood glucose levels more frequently, and the
effect on the postprandial blood glucose was not adequately

evaluated in this study. The glucose peak concentration may
have been missed for some of the subjects in this study.
However, the same muesli as was used in this study, containing
4 g oat ␤-glucan, has previously been shown to reduce the
postprandial glucose and insulin levels in healthy subjects [11].
Another limitation of this study is that we did not evaluate the
satiety more frequently.

It might be that 4 g oat ␤-glucan is needed to decrease glucose
and insulin levels in healthy subjects, however this is only based
on an observation that 3 g oat ␤-glucan did not affect the glycemic
response [11]. It has previously been shown that oat ␤-glucan
reduces postprandial glucose and insulinemic responses in healthy
subjects [11–14] and in type 2 diabetes patients [15–17]. In pa-
tients with type 2 diabetes it has been shown that oat bran flour
containing 9.4 g ␤-glucan lowered postprandial glycemia [17]. In
the same study, oat bran crisps containing 3.0 g ␤-glucan reduced
postprandial glycemia but the reduction was only half that ob-
served with the oat bran flour [17]. Another study on type 2
diabetes patients showed that each gram of oat ␤-glucan in food
could lower the GI by four units [16].

It has been suggested that reduced postprandial glucose and
insulin concentrations after the consumption of viscous types of
fiber could be caused by delayed mouth-to-cecum transit and
delayed absorption of glucose in the small intestine [26]. The
viscosity of oat gum, an oat extract composed of ␤-glucan, has
been shown to cause a reduction in plasma glucose and insulin

[27]. A relationship between glycemic response and the con-
centration and molecular weight of oat ␤-glucan has also been
observed [28]. Another hypothesis that has been proposed is
that ␤-glucan is fermented in the colon by the bacterial flora
and leads to a release of short-chain fatty acids, lowering
postprandial glucose levels [29] and serum lipids [30].

It has been found, using paracetamol as a marker for gastric
emptying, that the GER was not affected in healthy subjects after
a meal consisting of rye bread containing ␤-glucan [18]. The
paracetamol method is dependent on the release and absorption of
paracetamol in the small intestine, which makes this method
unreliable; also, the study was designed to evaluate the effect of
rye and not oat ␤-glucan. In the same study the postprandial blood
glucose response to the ␤-glucan rye bread containing 5.4 g
␤-glucan did not differ from that to white wheat bread. However,
the same study showed that postprandial insulin and glucose-
dependent insulinotropic polypeptide responses were lower after
the ␤-glucan rye bread meal [18]. When 5 g or 10 g of oat
␤-glucan were consumed this led to lower postprandial blood
glucose levels, but no effect was observed after consumption of
the same amount of barley ␤-glucan in hypercholesterolemic
subjects [12]. The effect on postprandial blood glucose may,
therefore, depend on the cereal source of ␤-glucan.

CONCLUSIONS

The results of the present study suggest that the muesli
containing 4 g oat ␤-glucan in a semisolid meal does not affect
the GER or satiety in healthy subjects compared to cornflakes.
The reduction in postprandial glucose response in healthy sub-
jects after the meal containing 4 g oat ␤-glucan muesli, com-
pared to muesli with cornflakes, could not be explained by
delayed GER. Clearly, a larger trial involving a greater number
of patients would be needed to validate the findings of this
small study.

Objective: Soluble dietary fiber has been shown to attenuate the postprandial rise in blood glucose levels and
reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. This effect seems to be related to its rheological
properties including viscosity. We examined the intra-fiber variability between two different processing methods
of concentrating ␤-glucan from oats (aqueous vs. enzymatic) in relation to the level of viscosity of ␤-glucan and
its effect on postprandial glycemia in healthy individuals.

Design: In an acute, randomized, double-blind, crossover study, 11 healthy subjects (gender: 5M:6F; age:
34 ⫾ 5 years; BMI: 23 ⫾ 0.8 kg/m2) were randomly assigned, on three separate occasions, to consume one of
three fiber-matched treatments along with a 75g oral glucose drink. The enzymatically processed ␤-glucan
(Oat-A) differed from ␤-glucan processed through the aqueous method (Oat-B) solely with regard to viscosity.
Finger-prick capillary blood samples were obtained at fasting and at 15, 30, 45, 60, 90 and 120 min after the start
of the test drink. The viscosities of the fiber drinks were determined (Paar Physica UDS200 viscometer).

Results: Rheological measurements demonstrated that Oat-A had a significantly higher viscosity than Oat-B
and control at 5, 15, 30, 60, and 120 min (p ⬍ 0.001). The incremental area under the glucose curve (AUC) on
Oat-A was 19.6% and 17% lower than that of Oat-B and control, respectively (p ⬍ 0.01).

Conclusions: This study shows that processing oat ␤-glucan through enzymatic, rather than by aqueous

methods, preserves the viscosity and improves postprandial glycemic control.

INTRODUCTION

It has been repeatedly demonstrated that daily consumption
of soluble dietary fiber can significantly reduce the risk of type
2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease [1]. This is due in part to
the ability of fiber to reduce postprandial glycemia and improve
long-term glycemic control [2,3]. It is hypothesized that the
rheological properties of soluble dietary fiber are highly related

to its effects on glucose control [4]. For instance, the ability of
oat-derived ␤-glucan to reduce postprandial glycemia has been
strongly correlated with its viscosity [5], demonstrating an
inverse linear relationship between the logarithm of viscosity
measures and peak postprandial plasma glucose and insulin
responses after consuming various doses of purified oat
␤-glucan with a 50g oral glucose load. Despite these find-
ings, the levels of viscosity required to achieve specific

glucose-lowering effects are poorly understood. Still, the
majority of trials investigating dietary fiber have not ac-
counted for the principles of polysaccharide solubility and
viscosity as the main determinants of its physiological out-
come. While a small number of studies have shown the
inter-fiber variability in viscosity [3], none have compared
the intra-fiber variability or the differences in viscosity
within the same type of fiber.

In order to increase the physiological effectiveness of oat
␤-glucan concentrates, a unique technology has been developed
to increase their ␤-glucan content while maintaining its native
molecular weight and thus, viscosity. The current study inves-
tigated oat ␤-glucan concentrates produced by two processing
methods: the first is an aqueous process conventionally used to
extract ␤-glucan by solubilizing it in large quantities of water;
the second is a novel process which is an alcohol-based enzy-
matic technique used to concentrate the native cell walls con-
taining the ␤-glucan. While the aim of both procedures is to
remove the starch and protein components of the oats, the
second process aims to obtain a fiber concentrate of high
viscosity by preserving the native state of ␤-glucan, whereas
the ␤-glucan can be degraded upon solubilization in the first
process due to high shear and endogenous enzyme activity.

The purpose of this study was to examine the intra-fiber
variability between these two methods of ␤-glucan concentra-
tion by (1) investigating the effect of two sources of oat
␤-glucan concentrates on postprandial glycemia in healthy in-
dividuals and to (2) explore the levels of viscosity required to
achieve glucose-lowering effects.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS

Subjects

Eleven healthy subjects (gender: 5M:6F, age: 34 ⫾ 5 years;
BMI: 23 ⫾ 0.8 kg/m2) were recruited through hospital adver-
tisements. All subjects gave written, informed consent to take
part in the study, which was approved by the St. Michael’s
Hospital Research Ethics Board.

Treatments

Subjects received a total of three treatments in a double-
blind, randomized order. The tests included 300 ml of an oral
glucose drink (75g-Glucodex®, Chambly, QB) diluted with
150 ml of water added to either 10.17 g of Oat-B (6g of
␤-glucan; concentrate obtained by an aqueous extraction pro-
cess), 11.05 g of Oat-A (6g of ␤-glucan; concentrate obtained
by an alcohol-based enzymatic process) or a combination of 8 g
fructooligosaccharide and 3 g of wheat bran (control). Seventy-
five grams of glucose was the standard dose administered
according to WHO guidelines. The treatments were almost
identical in energy and macronutrient composition. The bever-
ages were prepared by slowly adding the fiber to 150 mL of

water while stirring to ensure that it was mixed uniformly and
then adding 300 mL of Glucodex®. The drink was adminis-
tered to subjects in the mixing cup immediately following
preparation. Subjects were asked to consume the entire bever-
age over 5 min. The weighing, mixing and preparation of the
three treatments were performed by a blinder independent from
the study, who also performed the randomization using a ran-
domization table. Subjects were blinded by providing them
with the treatments in two equal portions so that they were not
left to gel and they were allotted 5 min to consume the treat-
ment drinks.

Protocol

Subjects attended the Clinical Nutrition and Risk Factor
Modification Centre at St. Michael’s hospital on three separate
mornings following a 10 –12 h overnight fast. A minimum of 3
days separated each visit to eliminate any carry-over effects.
Subjects were instructed to maintain the same dietary and
exercise patterns the evening before each visit. To ensure that
these instructions were followed, subjects completed a ques-
tionnaire detailing pre-session information about their diet and
lifestyle patterns. Before the beginning of each test, subjects’
height (m) and weight (kg) were measured and each subject
gave approximately 250␮L of a fasting finger-prick capillary
blood sample, using a Monoejector Lancet device (Owen Mum-
ford Ltd., Woodstock, Oxon, England). One of the three treat-
ments was then administered. Additional finger-prick blood
samples were obtained at 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, and 120 min after
the start of the treatment. All samples were collected in tubes
containing fluoride oxalate and immediately frozen at ⫺20°C
pending analysis.

Blood Glucose Analysis

All samples were analyzed within three days of collection.
The glucose concentration of each was determined by the
glucose oxidase method using a YSI 2300 Stat glucose/
L-lactate analyzer, model 115 (Yellow Springs, Ohio).

Viscosity Determination

the fiber

Corresponding amounts of

ingredients were
blended into 15 mL of water followed by 30 mL of Glucodex®.
In order to illustrate the viscosity changes over time, drinks
were held in a water bath at 37°C for up to 2 h (duration of
glycemic response testing). Throughout this holding period,
tubes containing the beverage samples were inverted 2–3 times
every 10 min to provide a gentle mix in an effort to mimic body
conditions, rather than continuous stirring with a magnetic
stirrer since the mixing is rather vigorous even at the lowest
setting. Samples were removed from the water bath at the end
of the holding time, centrifuged (3000 ⫻ g for 10 min) and the
viscosity of the supernatant was determined using a Paar
Physica UDS 200 viscometer (equipped with a cup and bob

640

VOL. 26, NO. 6

double gap geometry and Peltier heating system) at 37°C and
different shear rates. The samples were centrifuged to remove
insoluble solids due to the sensitivity of the narrow double gap
geometry of the rheometer. Therefore, the viscosity of the
whole drink may be higher; however, the viscosity of the
supernatant as determined in this test represents the soluble
fraction thickened mainly by ␤-glucan.

Statistical Analyses

A power calculation was carried out in order to select the
number of subjects required to participate in the study. Differ-
ences in postprandial blood glucose were detected with 80%
power at a level of p ⬍ 0.05 (two-tailed) by the number of
subjects. Blood glucose curves were plotted as the incremental
change in blood glucose over time and the positive incremental
area under the curve (AUC) was calculated geometrically for
each subject, ignoring areas below the fasting blood glucose
value [6]. Incremental blood glucose concentrations were used
to control for baseline/fasting differences between the treat-
ments. Statistical analyses were then performed using the Num-
ber Cruncher Statistical System (NCSS statistical software,
Kaysville, Utah). Repeated measures two-way analysis of vari-
ance (ANOVA) assessed interactive and independent effects of
treatment (Oat-A vs. Oat-B vs. control) as well as viscosity
(Oat-A vs. Oat-B vs. control). Pairwise differences in AUC and
incremental glycemia at each time point (15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120
min) between the treatments were assessed by repeated mea-
sures one-way ANOVA adjusted for multiple comparisons with
the Tukey-Kramer multiple comparison test. All results were
expressed as mean ⫾ SD and considered statistically signifi-
cant at p ⬍ 0.05.

RESULTS

All subjects completed all treatments without difficulty.
Questionnaires revealed that subjects ate a minimum of 150g of
carbohydrate each of the three days before the three sessions
and that evening activities, amount of sleep, reported feelings
of health and well-being, mode of transportation to the clinic,
and weight did not differ between the sessions with each
subject. There were also no complaints about the nature of the
␤-glucan drinks nor any side effects from consumption of the
drink during the test or within 24 h following the test. The
subjects consumed all of the treatment drinks in the allotted 5
min for each test.

Viscosity measurements for the 3 treatments are shown,
where the centipoise (cps) was used as a unit of absolute
viscosity (Fig. 1). Rheological measurements demonstrated that
Oat-A had a significantly higher viscosity than Oat-B and
control at 5, 15, 30, 60 and 120 min (p ⬍ 0.001) using two-way
repeated measures ANOVA.

multiple comparisons by the Tukey-Kramer procedure, p ⬍ 0.001).

Incremental postprandial blood glucose was lower, but not
significant, at the peak glucose concentration occurring at 30
min (p ⬍ 0.07) on Oat-A compared with Oat-B and control
(Fig. 2). Changes in area under the curve (AUC) for blood
glucose, following the administration of one of the ␤-glucan
treatments or control together with a 75g oral glucose drink is
shown in Fig. 3. Two-way repeated measures ANOVA indi-
cated differences in the effect of treatment (Oat-A vs. Oat-B vs.
control). Postprandial glucose AUC was significantly reduced
(p ⬍ 0.01) after Oat-A (193 ⫾ 58 min 䡠 mmol/L) compared to
Oat-B and control (240 ⫾ 72 min 䡠 mmol/L and 232 ⫾ 70 min 䡠
mmol/L, respectively). These differences represented a 19.6%
reduction between Oat-A and Oat-B and a 17% reduction
between Oat-A and control. There was no significant difference
(p ⬎ 0.05) between Oat-B and control.

DISCUSSION

This study is the first to investigate the acute glycemic-
lowering effects of ␤-glucan concentrated with a novel tech-
nology that specifically targets the preservation of its rheologi-
cal properties. The results from this study demonstrated a
significant reduction in postprandial blood glucose after the
ingestion of Oat-A; the treatment with the highest viscosity.
Beta-glucan has been shown to decrease plasma glucose con-
centrations following a single meal in both healthy individuals
and those with type 2 diabetes [7]. These results support earlier
work, which attributes the reduced glucose response to ␤-glu-
can’s ability to increase the viscosity of intestinal digesta [8].
Therefore, it is essential that the isolation and concentration of

␤-glucan preserve its native physicochemical properties, espe-
cially its molecular weight and physiological solubility that
influence the solution viscosity of ␤-glucan.

Consumption of ␤-glucan with a meal increases the viscosity
of the food bolus in the alimentary tract [8]. The increased vis-
cosity is thought to reduce the absorption rate of the digested
nutrients from the small intestine by resisting the convective
effects of intestinal contractions and thus decreasing the postpran-
dial glucose and insulin peaks [13]. This effect is thought to be
proportional with the level of fiber viscosity [3,9], defined as the
resistance to flow, or “stickiness”, that enables fibers such as
␤-glucan to form a viscous slurry in the gastrointestinal tract

[14,15]. Increased viscosity of the intestinal contents also impedes
bulk diffusion from the lumen to the surface of the small intestine,
due to an increase in thickness of the unstirred water layer [10],
and perhaps due to delayed gastric emptying [11].

tion (FDA) because it has been studied extensively. Specifi-
cally, it is claimed that the consumption of oat and oat products
containing 0.75 grams of ␤-glucan per serving can reduce the
risk of heart disease [12]. The FDA accepts that viscosity is a
major physicochemical property responsible for the physiolog-
ical effects of soluble fiber [16]. This recognition is based on

642

VOL. 26, NO. 6

the fact that not all clinical studies evaluated by the FDA [12]
resulted in positive outcomes and that physicochemical prop-
erties of ␤-glucan can be significantly affected by processing
treatments. There is growing interest in extracting ␤-glucan
from oats and barley so that it can be incorporated into a variety
of food products, since it is not realistic to consume the rec-
ommended 3g ␤-glucan/day [12] based on oats alone over
extended periods of time.

Conventional methods of concentrating ␤-glucan involve
aqueous extraction processes whereby large quantities of water
are required to solubilize ␤-glucan. The resulting ␤-glucan
concentrates from these conventional methods show lower vis-
cosity upon resolubilization in water, as demonstrated in the
current study with Oat-B. This may result from the high shear-
ing involved in processing and endogenous enzymes present in
the grains, such as cellulase and ␤-glucanase which hydrolyze
the ␤-glucan molecule, altering its molecular weight and there-
fore, its ability to form viscous solutions. Thus, the quality of
␤-glucan is degraded. A recently developed novel technology
concentrates ␤-glucan using an alcohol-based enzymatic tech-
nique. In this process, grain flour is slurried in aqueous ethanol
and treated with special enzyme cocktails to hydrolyze protein
and starch. Subsequently, the ␤-glucan enriched cell wall fiber
particulates that are freed from starch and protein are recovered
by simple filtration techniques. In the presence of alcohol,
␤-glucan is not solubilized and remains intact within the cell
wall. This technology yields fiber concentrates with superior
␤-glucan characteristics (i.e. higher molecular weight and vis-
cosity) than those produced through aqueous techniques as
demonstrated with Oat-A. Since ␤-glucan is not solubilized
from cell walls, potential hydrolysis by endogenous enzymes
such as cellulose and ␤-glucanase is minimized. As a result,
␤-glucan concentrations of up to 60% (w/w on a dry weight
basis) can be obtained by this technology that preserves the
physicochemical properties of native ␤-glucan. Viscosity mea-
surements thus confirmed our hypothesis that Oat-A had a
higher viscosity than Oat-B and control (Fig. 1) and that there
was a reduction in postprandial blood glucose (Figs. 2 and 3).
A review of clinical studies shows that there have been less
clear relationships between polysaccharide viscosity and gly-
cemic response. The data from this study are in agreement with
Wood et al. [17] indicating that rheological properties such as
viscosity are more important in determining the physiological
effects of fiber than the type and quantity of fiber, however, this
study examines the glycemic-lowering effects of ␤-glucan con-
centrated with an enzymatic technology that specifically targets
the preservation of viscosity. The findings have shown that this
concentration process can be successful in maintaining the
viscosity and physiological effects of native ␤-glucan without
any degradation. There have been previous reports relating
viscosity and the dose of ␤-glucan to glycemic control, how-
ever, this study emphasizes that even with the same dose of
␤-glucan, viscosities may differ due to the type of processing
method - a factor that may influence the amount and properties

␤-Glucan, Viscosity and Postprandial Glycemia

of ␤-glucan. Our data is similar to data presented in other
literature; however, there is inadequate information on the
bioavailability of ␤-glucan, which makes comparison among
the studies difficult. Selecting the process of concentration is
important in the preservation of the ␤-glucan molecule. Beta-
glucan is a cell wall component of cereal grains and exists in
appreciable amounts in barley (up to 15%, w/w) and oat (up to
7%, w/w). A number of clinical studies have demonstrated the
positive health benefits (i.e. lowering of blood cholesterol,
regulation of blood glucose levels and stimulation of the im-
mune system) of increasing the level of oat or barley ␤-glucans
to physiologically effective concentrations in the human diet.
Implications of these findings are promising. The effect of
various processing conditions on the physicochemical proper-
ties of oat ␤-glucans such as viscosity and how such effects
influence hyperglycemia and conditions including hyperlipid-
emia and other risk factors for diabetes and cardiovascular
disease are certainly important topics for further research. As
well, there is a growing interest in extracting ␤-glucan from
oats so that it can be incorporated into a variety of food
products, however, findings in the liquid form may not be
universally applied to the solid form. Little is known about the
behavior of ␤-glucan in different food matrices and recent
findings only show an inconsistent effect of ␤-glucan when
administered in different forms [18]. This is subject to future
investigations. To our knowledge, this is the first study to
compare two oat ␤-glucan concentrates with similar chemical
compositions, but different viscosities. This study emphasizes
the importance of processing methods in the production of oat
␤-glucan concentrates in preserving the viscosity of ␤-glucan,
thus increasing the efficacy of such products in reducing post-
prandial glycemia.

Aim: To examine whether a low-carbohydrate, high-unsaturated/low-saturated fat diet
(LC) improves glycaemic control and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors in overweight
and obese patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D).
Methods: A total of 115 adults with T2D (mean [SD]; BMI, 34.6 [4.3] kg/m2; age, 58 [7] years;
HbA1c, 7.3 [1.1]%) were randomized to 1 of 2 planned energy-matched, hypocaloric diets com-
bined with aerobic/resistance exercise (1 hour, 3 days/week) for 2 years: LC: 14% energy as
carbohydrate, 28% as protein, 58% as fat (<10% saturated fat); or low-fat, high-carbohydrate,
low-glycaemic index diet (HC): 53% as CHO, 17% as protein, 30% as fat (<10% saturated fat).
HbA1c, glycaemic variability (GV), anti-glycaemic medication effect score (MES, calculated
based on the potency and dosage of diabetes medication), weight, body composition, CVD and
renal risk markers were assessed before and after intervention.
Results: A total of 61 (LC = 33, HC = 28) participants completed the study (trial registration:
http://www.anzctr.org.au/, ANZCTR No. ACTRN12612000369820). Reductions in weight (esti-
mated marginal mean [95% CI]; LC, −6.8 [−8.8,−4.7], HC, −6.6 [−8.8, −4.5] kg), body fat (LC, −4.3
[−6.2, −2.4], HC, −4.6 [−6.6, −2.7] kg), blood pressure (LC, −2.0 [−5.9, 1.8]/ −1.2 [−3.6, 1.2], HC,
−3.2 [−7.3, 0.9]/ −2.0 [−4.5, 0.5] mmHg), HbA1c (LC, −0.6 [−0.9, −0.3], HC, −0.9 [−1.2, −0.5] %)
and fasting glucose (LC, 0.3 [−0.4, 1.0], HC, −0.4 [−1.1, 0.4] mmol/L) were similar between groups
(P ≥ 0.09). Compared to HC, the LC achieved greater reductions in diabetes medication use
(MES; LC, −0.5 [−0.6, −0.3], HC, −0.2 [−0.4, −0.02] units; P = 0.03), GV (Continuous Overall Net
Glycemic Action calculated every 1 hour (LC, −0.4 [−0.6, −0.3], HC, −0.1 [−0.1, 0.2] mmol/L;
P = 0.001), and 4 hours (LC, −0.9 [−1.3, −0.6], HC, −0.2 [−0.6, 0.1] mmol/L; P = 0.02)); triglycer-
ides (LC, −0.1 [−0.3, 0.2], HC, 0.1 [−0.2, 0.3] mmol/L; P = 0.001), and maintained HDL-C levels
(LC, 0.02 [−0.05, 0.1], HC, −0.1 [−0.1, 0.01] mmol/L; P = 0.004), but had similar changes in LDL-
C (LC, 0.2 [−0.1, 0.5], HC, 0.1 [−0.2, 0.4] mmol/L; P = 0.85), brachial artery flow mediated dilata-
tion (LC, −0.5 [−1.5, 0.5], HC, −0.4 [−1.4, 0.7] %; P = 0.73), eGFR and albuminuria.
Conclusions: Both diets achieved comparable weight loss and HbA1c reductions. The LC sus-
tained greater reductions in diabetes medication requirements, and in improvements in diurnal
blood glucose stability and blood lipid profile, with no adverse renal effects, suggesting greater
optimization of T2D management.

INTRODUCTION

The worldwide prevalence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) continues to
surge despite therapeutic advances, highlighting the urgent need for
more effective treatment strategies. Lifestyle management encom-
passing nutrition therapy and physical activity form the cornerstone
of diabetes care. However, the most efficacious long-term nutrition
therapy remains controversial. While leading health authorities now
advocate
diabetes
management,1,2 different diets may vary in their efficacy in improving
glycaemic control and reducing the risk of cardiovascular dis-
ease (CVD).

to

Low-fat, high-unrefined carbohydrate diets have been the pre-
dominant public health weight-management recommendation for the
past several decades and have typically been prescribed for the die-
tary management of T2D.3,4 However, emerging evidence suggests
that carbohydrate restriction and higher intakes of protein and unsat-
urated fats, independent of weight loss, improve glycaemic control
and some CVD risk markers, potentially conferring greater benefits
over high-carbohydrate diets3–8. Hyperglycaemia is a salient charac-
teristic of T2D, and dietary carbohydrates, particularly those that are
refined, are the greatest determinant of postprandial glycaemia.8
Restricting the intake of carbohydrates to alleviate hyperglycaemia
can lead to fewer glycaemic excursions and allow for reduction of
medications.
It is thus easily understood by, and acceptable to,
patients.9

Despite the greater interest in, and use of,

low-carbohydrate
diets, their long-term effectiveness and sustainability in individuals
with T2D have not been well studied. Current guidelines assert that
there is insufficient evidence in isocaloric comparisons to recommend
an ideal carbohydrate intake or to recommend such diets, over other
diets, for individuals with diabetes.1,10 Amongst the limited number
of studies of low-carbohydrate diets in individuals with T2D beyond
1 year, 1 study prescribed a relatively high carbohydrate composition
(~150-189 g/day, 40% energy) in the low-carbohydrate diet group
and included only a small subgroup of 36 people with T2D.11 Another
study administered a low-intensity intervention with limited profes-
sional contact that resulted in reduced treatment adherence.12 Nei-
ther study controlled for differences in energy intakes, assessed
changes in diabetes medication use or glycemic variability (GV,
emerging as an independent risk factor for diabetes complications13),
nor considered physical activity. To address these limitations, we
designed a randomized controlled trial (RCT) aimed at comparing the
effectiveness of 2 isocaloric diets in individuals with T2D: a low-
carbohydrate and low-saturated fat diet (LC) vs a conventional low-
fat, higher-carbohydrate, low-glycemic index diet (HC).

We previously reported that, over 1 year, the LC produced
greater improvements than the HC in glycaemic control (lower diabe-
tes medication requirements and GV), and more favourable lipid pro-
file changes (increased HDL-C and reduced triglycerides [TG]),
in
adults with T2D.14 We reported these early results given their clinical
importance to this high-risk study population.

We now report the longer-term (2-year) sustainability of these
effects by comparing isocaloric LC and HC as part of a lifestyle inter-
vention incorporating
structured exercise regime, with a

a

comprehensive evaluation of glycaemic control, anthropometry and
CVD risk markers in obese adults with T2D.

2 | MATERIALS AND METHODS

2.1 | Study design and participants

The study design has been described previously.15,16 This outpatient,
single-centre, parallel-groups, RCT was conducted from May 2012
through September 2014 at the Commonwealth Scientific Industrial
Research Organisation (CSIRO) Clinical Research Unit
(Adelaide,
Australia). Participants with established T2D under the care of a gen-
eral practitioner and/or endocrinologist were recruited from the com-
munity, primarily through media advertisements, and included
individuals aged 35 to 68 years with T2D (HbA1c ≥ 7.0% and/or
using diabetes medication including insulin), and with a body mass
index (BMI) of 26 to 45 kg/m2. Major exclusion criteria were: type-1
diabetes; renal, hepatic, respiratory, gastrointestinal or cardiovascular
disease; history of malignancy; any significant endocrinopathy (other
than stable treated thyroid disease); pregnancy/lactation; history of
or current eating disorder; or smoking. All study participants provided
written informed consent. The CSIRO Human Research Ethics Com-
mittee approved the study.

Participants were block-matched for age, gender, BMI, HbA1c
and diabetes medication using random varying block sizes and were
allocated to the LC or HC (1:1) by random computer-generated
assignment (Figure 1). The research associates who conducted these
randomization procedures were not involved in outcome assessments
and intervention delivery. The researchers involved in outcome
assessment and data analysis were blinded to treatment assignment.

2.2 | Diet and physical activity interventions

The planned macronutrient compositions of the 2 diets were: LC,
14% carbohydrate (< 50 g/day), 28% protein and 58% total fat (35%
monounsaturated fat and 13% polyunsaturated fat), with the inclu-
sion of an additional 20-g carbohydrate allowance after week 24 for
the remainder of the study; HC, 53% carbohydrate (processed carbo-
hydrates and high glycaemic index foods were discouraged, with an
emphasis on the selection of low glycaemic foods; overall glycaemic
index of 46), 17% protein and <30% total fat (15% monounsaturated
fat and 9% polyunsaturated fat), reflecting traditional dietary guide-
lines, with the inclusion of an approved food exchange (which met
the macronutrient profile of the diet and was equivalent to the
energy content of 20 g of carbohydrate) after week 24 for the
remainder of the study so that the diets remained isocaloric. Satu-
rated fat was limited in both diets (< 10% energy).

Participants met individually with a dietitian for diet instruction
and support every 2 weeks for 12 weeks and monthly thereafter.
During the first 12 weeks, participants were provided with key foods
(~30% total energy) representative of their assigned diets to achieve
the targeted macronutrient profiles (Table S1). These foods were
listed in a semi-quantitative food record that participants completed
daily. After 12 weeks, for the remainder of the study, participants

plans were individualized and energy-matched, with moderate (~30%)
restriction to facilitate weight loss (500-1000 kcal/day deficit; 1357-

2143 kcal/day energy prescription).17 Caloric prescriptions were
maintained throughout the study to preserve planned isocaloric con-
trol between diets.

The same professionally supervised 60-minute exercise classes,
incorporating moderate-intensity aerobic and resistance exercise on
3 non-consecutive days per week were prescribed for all participants.
The dietitians and exercise professionals responsible for delivering
the intervention were trained in behavioural strategies,
including
motivational
interviewing and goal-setting techniques, that were
applied during the intervention. This research design enabled the
effects of the diets to be studied in the context of lifestyle interven-
tion, whilst maintaining the ability to address the a priori research
objective of comparing and isolating the differential effects of the HC
and LC diets on the outcomes.

2.3 | Outcome measures

Body-weight and plasma ketones were measured monthly through
the study. All other data were collected at baseline and at 24, 52 and
104 weeks. At each time point, fasting blood samples were collected
from a forearm vein into tubes containing no additives for lipids, insu-
lin, C-reactive protein (CRP) and creatinine; sodium fluoride/EDTA
for glucose and ketones; and potassium/EDTA for HbA1c. Plasma or
serum was isolated by centrifugation at 2000g for 10 minutes at 5C
(Beckman GS-6R centrifuge; Brea, California) and stored at −80C
until analysed. Urine samples to assess albumin were frozen at −80C
in polyethylene tubes until analysed.

2.4 | Primary outcome

HbA1c (SA Pathology; Adelaide, Australia) was the primary outcome
measure.

2.5 | Secondary outcomes

2.5.1 | Glycaemic variability and changes in diabetes
medication

GV was assessed from 48-hour continuous blood glucose monitoring
(CGM,
iPro 2; Medtronic; North Ryde, Australia) and included
SDGlucose, mean amplitude of glycaemic excursions (MAGE, average
of blood glucose excursions exceeding 1 SD of the mean blood glu-
cose value) and continuous overall net glycaemic action (CONGA-1
and CONGA-4, SD of differences between observations 1 or 4 hour
(s) apart, respectively).13,14

An antiglycaemic Medication Effect Score (MES) based on medi-
cation potency and dosage was used to assess changes in utilization
of antiglycaemic agents including insulin.18 Higher MES corresponds
to higher diabetes medication requirement.

2.5.2 | Anthropometric data

Height was measured using a stadiometer (SECA, Hamburg, Ger-
many), body-weight using calibrated electronic scales (Mercury
AMZ1, Tokyo, Japan) and waist circumference by tape measure posi-
tioned 3 cm above the iliac crest. Body composition (fat mass[FM] and
fat-free mass [FFM]) was determined by whole-body dual-energy

X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA; Lunar Prodigy; General Electric Corpo-
ration, Madison, Wisconsin).

2.5.3 | Cardiovascular and metabolic measures

Japan) using standard enzymatic kits

Resting blood pressure was measured by automated sphygmoma-
nometry (SureSigns VS3; Phillips, Andover, Massacusetts). Plasma glu-
cose, serum total cholesterol, HDL-C, TG and CRP were measured on
a Roche Hitachi 902 auto-analyser (Hitachi Science Systems Ltd, Ibar-
aki,
(Roche Diagnostics,
Indianapolis, Indiana). LDL-C levels were calculated using the Friede-
wald equation.19 Non-HDL-C was calculated as the difference
between total cholesterol and HDL-C.20 Plasma insulin concentra-
tions were determined using a commercial enzyme immunoassay kit
(Mercodia AB, Uppsala, Sweden). HOMA index 2 assessed β cell func-
tion (HOMA2-%B) and insulin resistance (HOMA2-IR)21. Flow-
mediated vasodilatation (FMD) of the brachial artery was evaluated
according to recommended guidelines, as previously described.22

2.5.4 | Renal function markers

Serum creatinine was measured on a clinical analyser (Beckman
AU480; Beckman Coulter Inc, Brea, California) using a standardized
assay (Beckman kit #OSR6178). Glomerular filtration rate was esti-
mated by the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration
equation (eGFR-CKD-EPI).23 Creatinine Clearance (CrCl) was esti-
mated by the Cockcroft-Gault and the Salazar-Corcoran equation.16
Albumin excretion rate (AER) and urinary albumin from 24-hour urine
samples were measured at a certified commercial
laboratory
(SA Pathology, Adelaide, Australia).

2.5.5 | Diet and physical activity data

Dietary intake was assessed from a random sample of 7 consecutive
days of daily weighed food records within every 14-day period, using
Foodworks Professional Edition Version 7 (Xyris Software 2012,
Highgate Hill, Australia) to obtain average quarterly nutrient intake
over 104 weeks. The 24-hour urinary-urea/creatinine ratio (IMVS)
was assessed as a marker of protein intake.24 Plasma ketones
(β-hydroxybutyrate) were assessed as a marker of reduced carbohy-
drate intake (RANBUT D-3 Hydroxybutyrate kit; Antrim, UK). Physi-
cal activity levels were assessed using data from 7 consecutive days
of triaxial accelerometry (GT3X + model; ActiGraph, Pensacola, Flor-
ida), with pre-defined validity cutoffs25 and including exercise session
attendance.

2.6 | Statistical analyses

Primary analysis was by random-coefficient analysis, with data
assumed to be missing at random. Linear mixed-effects models that
included fixed effects for each time-point and diet-group assignment,
and a diet group by time-point interaction were used to evaluate
between-group differences in outcomes. The restricted maximum
likelihood, linear mixed-effects model permits a variable number of
observations
for participants, and an unstructured covariance
accounts for correlations between repeated measures over time. In
accordance with an intention-to-treat principle, analyses included all
available data from the 115 participants who commenced the study.

TAY ET AL.

Baseline characteristics and exercise session attendance were com-
pared by independent t-tests and χ2 tests for continuous and cate-
gorical variables, respectively. Results are presented as estimated
marginal means (95% confidence intervals, CI) by linear mixed-effects
model analysis using SPSS 20.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc.; Chicago, Illi-
nois) unless otherwise stated. Changes from baseline to Week
104 are reported. All statistical tests were two-tailed using a signifi-
cance level of P < 0.05.

2.7 | Sample size and power

The study was designed to have 80% power to detect a previously
reported 0.7% absolute difference in HbA1c (primary outcome)
between diets,5,18,26 based on an anticipated ~50% dropout rate, as
typically observed in long-term diet and lifestyle interventions.6,27,28

3 | RESULTS

3.1 | Baseline characteristics

A total of 115 adults were randomized (LC, 57; HC, 58) (Figure 1).
Baseline characteristics were well matched between groups (Tables 1
and 2). Most participants were using oral anti-glycaemic medications
(LC, 48; HC,45); >75% were using metformin, 30% sulfonylureas and
10% exogenous insulin. Approximately two-thirds were using lipid-
lowering medications and anti-hypertensives. Among the total, 53% of
participants completed the study (LC, 33; HC, 28), with similar attrition
and reasons for withdrawal between groups (P = 0.40) (Figure 1).

3.2 | Dietary intake, physical activity and adherence
measures

The two groups reported similar caloric intakes (P = 0.93). Dietary
intakes were consistent with the prescribed diets (Table 3). Compared
to the HC, the LC group reported lower intakes of carbohydrate, and
higher intakes of protein and fat. Plasma and urinary biomarker data
also reflected higher protein and lower carbohydrate intake in the LC
group. The LC group experienced an initial three-fold greater increase
in plasma β-hydroxybutyrate levels compared to the HC group, with
levels decreasing towards baseline over time (time x diet, P = 0.02)
(Figure S1). The 24-hour urinary-urea data showed higher estimated
protein intakes in the LC group (1.1-1.3 g/kg vs 1.0-1.1 g/kg,
P < 0.001). Compared to the HC group, the LC group experienced
greater increases in 24-hour urinary-urea/creatinine excretion ratio,
which remained higher over the study period (P = 0.001) (Table 1).
Accelerometry data indicated that physical activity levels were similar
between groups (P ≥ 0.37) (Table 1). Exercise session attendance was
also similar between groups (LC, 56  24%; HC, 58  24%; P = 0.80).

3.3 | Weight and body composition

After 2 years, there were reductions in body-weight (Figure 2), total
FM and waist circumference, with no differences between groups
(P ≥ 0.09 for all). Among completers, 69% maintained a weight loss

of ≥5% (LC, 22; HC, 20; P = 0.69) and 34% achieved ≥10% weight
reduction (LC, 12; HC, 9; P = 0.73).

3.4 | Glycaemic control: HbA1c, glycaemic
variability, anti-glycaemic medication effect score
(MES) and insulin sensitivity

HbA1c reductions were similar in both groups (−0.7 [−1.0, −0.5] %;
P = 0.52) (Figure 3A). The LC group maintained greater reductions in
diabetes medication requirements (antiglycaemic MES, LC, −0.5 [−0.6,
−0.3], HC, −0.2 [−0.4, −0.02] units; P = 0.03) (Figure 3B). Over twice
the number of LC participants had a ≥ 20% reduction in MES com-
pared to HC participants (LC, 22; HC, 9).

Greater reductions in GV (MAGE, SDGlucose, Glucose range,
MODD, AUCTotal glucose per min, CONGA-1 and CONGA-4) occurred in
the LC group compared to the HC group (P = 0.001-0.24) (Table 2,
Figure 3). Differences persisted over 2 years and were statistically
significant for CONGA-1 (LC, −0.4 [−0.6, −0.3], HC, 0.1 [−0.1, 0.2]
mmol/L; P = 0.001) and CONGA-4 (LC, −0.9 [−1.3, −0.6], HC, −0.2
[−0.6, 0.1] mmol/L; P = 0.02) (Figure 3C,D). Fasting blood glucose
and insulin markers (insulin, HOMA2-IR and HOMA2-%B) decreased,
with no difference between groups (Table 2, P ≥ 0.13).

3.5 | CVD risk factors: blood pressure, lipids,
endothelial function and CRP

TAG decreased to a greater degree and HDL-C levels were main-
tained with the LC compared to the HC (P ≤ 0.004)
(Table 2).
Changes in non-HDL-C, total cholesterol, LDL-C, blood pressure and
CRP did not differ between groups (P ≥ 0.44). Endothelial function
(FMD) did not change in either group (P = 0.73). Concerning lipid-
lowering medications, 5 participants reduced dosage (LC, 3; HC, 2)
and 3 participants increased dosage (LC, 1; HC, 2). Concerning anti-
hypertensive medications, 15 participants (LC, 10; HC, 5) reduced
dosage and 5 participants (LC, 3; HC, 2) increased dosage.

3.6 | Renal markers

eGFR levels remained in the normal to mildly depressed range in both
groups. Comparable increases in SCr and reductions in eGFR and
CrCl occurred in both groups (Table 2, P ≥ 0.07). In 7 participants
(LC, 4; HC, 3) albuminuria was moderately increased (AER 30-
300 mg/24 h) at baseline and was normalized and maintained in
4 participants (LC, 2; HC, 2). Albuminuria persisted in 2 participants
(LC, 1; HC, 1) and 1 LC participant withdrew at Week 4 before study
completion. All other participants who were normoalbuminuric at
baseline remained so after 2 years.

3.7 | Adverse events

There were no adverse event-related treatment discontinuations. A
total of 21 participants (LC, 11; HC, 10) reported musculoskeletal ail-
ments associated with exercise training. These participants continued
the exercise program following recovery, although one participant
from the HC group, who reported exacerbation of pre-existing fibro-
myalgia secondary to resistance training (Week 64), withdrew from

4 | DISCUSSION

After 2 years, planned energy-matched LC and HC, prescribed in com-
bination with regular exercise, for adults with obesity and T2D
achieved clinically relevant weight loss and improvements in glycaemic
control and CVD risk factors. Compared to the HC, the LC maintained
more favourable lipoprotein profile changes and sustained greater
reductions in diabetes medication requirements and diurnal GV.

While both diets sustained clinically meaningful and equivalent
reductions in weight and HbA1c, the LC achieved these improve-
ments with more than two-fold greater reductions in diabetes medi-
cation requirements. Considering that
the population presently
examined had relatively low levels of baseline diabetes medication,
the mean 0.5-unit MES reduction in the LC group reflected a com-
plete cessation of diabetes medication (metformin 500 mg twice/day)
in 1 LC participant, or a change in medications from gliclazide MR
60 mg once/day to metformin 500 mg once/day in another. How-
ever, the mean 0.2-unit MES reduction in the HC group reflected a
reduction of 2.5 mg glibenclamide once daily in an HC participant or
10 units biphasic insulin aspart in another participant weighing
115 kg. Therefore, the greater reduction in diabetes medication in
the LC group could translate to at least 1 less tablet per day. It is
anticipated that reductions in individuals using higher levels of diabe-
tes medication would be significantly even greater18. Multiple-drug
therapy may be required to achieve T2D treatment goals52,54, but
cost considerations, including indirect healthcare system costs associ-
ated with drug administration, formulary restrictions and potential
side effects including hypoglycaemia and weight gain, serve as bar-
riers to medication adherence.10 Consequently, the benefits of an LC
to achieve glycaemic goals with lower medication could be consid-
ered clinically significant.

Large prospective RCTs suggest optimization of glucose control
to achieve near-normoglycaemia is a key treatment goal in T2D, to
reduce the risk or slow progression of diabetes-related complications,
especially microvascular diseases.10,31–35 However, some of these
studies showed intensive glucose control with medications that actu-
ally increased the risk of hypoglycaemia, weight gain and even mor-
tality.31,36 This finding argues that emphasizing lifestyle strategies,
including dietary modifications and increased physical activity, rather
than pharmacology may be healthier. Observational data suggest that

neuropathic symptoms may improve with circumventing extreme
blood glucose fluctuations.37 The LC produced greater reductions in
GV, with statistical significance for CONGA-1 and CONGA-4, mea-
sures of short-term glycaemic excursions. GV and HbA1c may reflect
different aspects of blood glucose regulation and accumulating evi-
dence suggests that GV is an independent risk factor for diabetes
complications.13 HbA1c provides limited characterization of GV and
is not significantly altered by transient hyperglycaemia or hypoglycae-
mic excursions, and short-term glucose fluctuations may determine

up to 89% of the diabetes complications risk not explained by
HbA1c.38 This is the first 2-year RCT to report on a diet strategy that
achieved greater GV improvements in T2D. The ability of the LC to
achieve more physiologically stable blood glucose profiles that were
sustained over the long-term, post-active weight-loss, extends the
benefits of LC for improving glycaemic control in T2D.

T2D increases CVD risk and multifactorial risk reduction involves
blood pressure and lipid management. Both groups had comparable
reductions in blood pressure. Additionally, the LC sustained greater
reductions in TAG and maintained HDL-C levels. The combination of
high TAG and low HDL-C is the most prevalent pattern of dyslipidae-
mia and an important contributor to accelerated atherosclerosis in
diabetes.39 Evidence for the pharmacological treatment of these lipid
fractions is considerably weaker than that for statin therapy.10 This
underscores the potential benefits of LC as a lifestyle strategy for
reducing CVD risk in T2D. In patients with T2D, a 15% decrease in
the risk of coronary artery disease has been associated with a
0.1 mmoL/L increment in HDL-C.40 Therefore, the maintenance of
HDL-C levels with the LC and the 0.12 mmoL/L differential change
observed between the diet groups would probably translate to a
reduction in CVD risk. In fact, the fatty acid composition of the LC
prescribed in this study, which was high in unsaturated fat and low in
saturated fat, was similar to a Mediterranean diet which was associ-
ated with a 29% reduction in major CVD events compared to a HC in
the PREDIMED trial.41 Changes
in LDL-C and non-HDL-C
(a comprehensive measure of cholesterol content in atherogenic lipo-
proteins including IDL, VLDL, Lp(a) and LDL-C, and a marker of resid-
ual CVD risk beyond LDL-C)20 did not differ between groups. FMD is
considered an important prognostic predictor for future cardiac
events and did not change significantly in either group.42

Concerning the long-term safety effects, clinical markers of renal
function, including eGFR, CrCl and albuminuria, a surrogate marker
for diabetic nephropathy, did not differ between groups after 2 years.
This supports the clinical applicability of LCs as a strategy to manage
weight, diabetes and comorbidities such as hypertension and dyslipi-
daemia despite their higher protein content, which some experts
have warned may worsen renal function.

The lifestyle interventions undertaken in this study achieved
≥5% weight loss in more than two-thirds of participants after 2 years,
a clinically significant magnitude of weight loss.43 This is comparable
to that achieved by pharmacotherapy44 and by the intensive lifestyle
intervention undertaken in Look AHEAD.45 Conversely, smaller
weight losses (−3 to −5 kg) have been observed in other trials of simi-
lar duration.11,12 This could be attributed to differences among the
studies in intervention intensity. In the present study and in Look
AHEAD, participants were followed up individually, at least monthly,
whereas contact in the studies with a lower magnitude of weight loss
was limited to group sessions every 6 to 24 weeks. This highlights
the importance of ongoing professional support to achieve successful
long-term adherence to diet and weight loss maintenance. Exercise
also was formally prescribed as part of the present intervention and
that of Look AHEAD, and findings from the National Weight Control
Registry46 further highlight the importance of regular physical activity

for weight
management.

The moderately high attrition that occurred may limit interpreta-
tion of the results. However, the similar dropout rates observed
which
between
previous
studies,5–7,12,27,28,47–49
suggests that both diets were similarly
accepted and highlights the persisting need to improve maintenance
of lifestyle modifications. Furthermore, treatment fidelity was main-
tained over the 2-year study duration. While the increase in carbohy-
drate allowance to 70 g/day in the LC group after 24 weeks, and the
isocaloric increase in calorie intake allowance in the HC group could
explain in part, the partial weight regain over time, dietary assess-
ments, supported by changes in biomarkers and secondary metabolic
outcomes, indicated an adequate level of adherence to diet and dif-
ferentiation between the LC and HC. The isocaloric prescription of
diets was an important strength of the study that enabled compari-
sons of the long-term efficacy and metabolic health effects between
the diets, without the confounding effect of differences in energy
intake and weight loss. Participants were followed beyond initial
weight loss into weight stabilization and even weight regain, provid-
ing further insight into the long-term effectiveness of both diets.
Whilst achievement of high compliance was a strength of the study,
the intensity of the intervention delivered, with high levels of profes-
sional support and subsidized food provisions, may limit generaliza-
tion for wide-scale community adoption. Future initiatives need to
integrate these research outcomes into cost-effective community-
based delivery models.

As participants were predominantly Caucasians, future studies
should investigate the utility of LC in individuals of diverse ethnici-
ties. In Asians, the rising risk of T2D has been attributed to inade-
quate compensatory β-cell response to increasing insulin resistance.50
In African Americans, dietary glycaemic load has been shown to inter-
act with insulin sensitivity to predict greater increases in adiposity.51
By reducing the glycaemic load to insulin-resistant tissues to achieve
durable glycaemic control and weight management,53 the LC may be
particularly beneficial to populations that bear a disproportionate bur-
den of T2D.

In summary, after 2 years, the planned isocaloric HC and LC, lim-
ited in saturated fat and administered as a lifestyle intervention pro-
gramme, achieved comparable reductions in HbA1c, body-weight and
blood pressure in adults with obesity and T2D. Additionally, the LC
maintained greater improvements in lipid profile, diurnal blood glu-
cose stability and reductions in requirements for diabetes medication.
Whilst there may not be a one-size-fits-all dietary approach for obe-
sity and T2D management, these data suggest that diets differ in
their efficacy in improving glycaemic control and reducing CVD risk.
These results provide support for the long-term safety, clinical effi-
cacy and potential therapeutic role of the LC in long-term T2D
management.

Abstract

Epidemiological studies have shown an inverse relation between a whole grain consumption and risk of type-2 diabetes

and cardiovascular disease. One tentative mechanism relates to colonic metabolism of indigestible carbohydrates. In a

previous study, we reported a positive relation between colonic fermentation and improved glucose tolerance. This work

can be seen as an extension of that study, focusing on the tentative role of speciﬁc colonic metabolites, i.e. SCFA. Plasma

concentrations of acetate, propionate, and butyrate were determined in the morning in healthy participants (5 women and
10 men, mean 6 SD: 25.9 6 3.2 y, BMI , 25) following 8 different cereal-based evening meals (50 g available starch)

varying in content of indigestible carbohydrates. Each participant consumed all test meals in a random order on separate

evenings. At a standardized breakfast following evening test meals, the postprandial glucose response (incremental area
under the curve, 0–120 min) was inversely related to plasma butyrate (r = 20.26; P , 0.01) and acetate (r = 20.20; P ,
0.05) concentrations. Evening meals composed of high-amylose barley kernels or high-b-glucan barley kernels resulted in

higher plasma butyrate concentrations the following morning compared with an evening meal with white wheat bread
(P , 0.05). The results support the view that cereal products rich in indigestible carbohydrates may improve glucose

tolerance through a mechanism involving colonic fermentation and generation of SCFA, where in particular butyric acid

may be involved. This mechanism may be one explanation by which whole grain is protective against type 2 diabetes and

cardiovascular disease. J. Nutr. doi: 10.3945/jn.110.123604.

Introduction

Food with a low glycemic index (GI)6 (1–5) and whole grain diets
(6–10) have proven beneﬁcial in the prevention and/or treatment of
diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and metabolic syndrome. Fur-
thermore, a low-GI diet combined with high intake of cereal ﬁber
appears to be particularly advantageous in preventing diabetes type
2 in both women (11) and men (12). In addition to lowering the
acute blood glucose response, low-GI foods also may reduce the
blood glucose response following a standardized “second meal”
consumed after 4 h (e.g. from breakfast to lunch) (13). Some cereal

iAUC,

foods that are rich in indigestible carbohydrates may, compared
with a white wheat bread (WWB), also lower the blood glucose
response to a meal in a 10-h perspective (e.g. from an evening meal
to a subsequent breakfast) (14–16). Colonic fermentation of
carbohydrates [dietary ﬁber (DF) and resistant starch (RS)] results
in formation of metabolites, particularly SCFA (mainly acetic,
propionic, and butyric acids) and gases (e.g. hydrogen) (17,18).
Although a substantial part of the SCFA formed is extracted during
passage of the liver (19), a fraction may enter the systemic
circulation and can be determined in the peripheral blood (20). It
has been suggested that certain SCFA may be involved in the
modulation of glucose metabolism (14,16,21) and lipid metabo-
lism (22) and it can be hypothesized that this may in fact be one
possible mechanism whereby whole grain foods exert beneﬁcial
metabolic effects as seen in observational studies. However, whole
grain foods are, in addition to being rich in DF, also rich in other
potentially bioactive phytochemicals such as minerals, plant
stanols and sterols, phenolic antioxidants, and vitamins (10,23).
Consequently, the mechanisms for the beneﬁcial effects of a whole
grain diet may be multi-factorial and remain to be elucidated.

Previously, we reported that cereal-based evening test meals
containing high amounts of whole grain constituents (barley DF
and RS) were capable of improving glucose excursion in healthy

young participants with normal BMI at a standardized breakfast
consumed 10 h later (24). A particularly interesting ﬁnding was
that not only incremental blood glucose area but also perceived
satiety correlated with breath hydrogen excretion, indicating a
role of colonic fermentation. Moreover, glycemia at breakfast
was inversely related to plasma levels of glucagon-like peptide-
1 (GLP-1), an incretin hormone increasingly acknowledged with
antidiabetic and antiobesity properties. This indicates that
colonic fermentation of DF and RS may affect a key parameter
involved in the regulation of glucose metabolism and satiety.
However, to verify such a mechanism, more speciﬁc fermenta-
tion metabolites should be considered, such as the SCFA. This
article provides data from analysis of SCFA (acetate, propionate,
and butyrate) in plasma obtained in the morning following the 8
cereal-based evening test meals referred to above (24). The paper
is thus an extension of the previous study and the SCFA data
reported herein are correlated to some relevant metabolic
markers obtained previously (plasma glucose, insulin, serum
FFA, plasma GLP-1, breath hydrogen, satiety, and gastric
emptying rate (GER) (24).

Materials and Methods

Participants. Seventeen healthy volunteers, 6 women and 11 men, aged
22–32 y (mean 6 SD; 25.9 6 3.2 y) with normal BMI (mean 6 SD;
22.5 6 2.1 kg/m2) were included in the study. They were carefully
informed that they could quit the experiment at any time without giving
any explanation. One man was excluded due to poor compliance with
the bread intake and 1 woman dropped out due to gastrointestinal
discomfort. Thus, 15 participants completed the study. Approval of the
study was given by the Regional Ethical Review Board in Lund, Sweden.

Evening test meals and the standardized breakfast. Eight cereal-
based evening test meals with different GI and contents of indigestible
carbohydrates were included in the study. Details regarding composition
and glycemic characters of the test meals are described elsewhere
[serving sizes, GI, available and total starch, RS, and DF (insoluble and
soluble) (24)]. Brieﬂy, the test meals consisted of bread with the main
proportion of carbohydrates derived from: 1) white wheat ﬂour (WWB,
reference product); 2) ordinary barley kernels (OB; nonspeciﬁed ordi-
nary Swedish barley provided by Lantma¨ nnen Food); 3) OB that were
cut 1–2 times (cutOB); 4) barley kernels from a variety with elevated
amounts of amylose, yielding increased levels of RS in the ﬁnished
product (HAB; 31% RS, starch basis, Karmose´, Svalo¨ f Weibull); 5)
barley kernels from a variety with elevated amounts of b-glucans (HBB;
;14% b-glucans on dry basis, mutant 13, Svalo¨ f Weibull); 6) WWB+RS;
WWB with added RS (RS2) from a high-amylose corn starch (Hi-maize
1043, Biomin) to match the RS content in OB; or 7) WWB with added
similar amounts of RS and also DF from barley (Lyckeby Sta¨ rkelsen) to
match the content of indigestible carbohydrates in the OB bread product.
To investigate a possible dose-response effect, 1 test meal consisted of
one-half a portion of OB bread (1/2OB bread). The size of all test meals
(except for the half portion) corresponded to 50 g available carbohy-
drates, calculated by subtracting RS (25) from the total starch content
(26). White wheat ﬂour was added to the kernel-based breads in
proportions (weight percent) of 10/90 white wheat ﬂour/kernels. Water
(unlimited amounts) was consumed with the test evening meals.

The standardized breakfast consisted of 116.7 g WWB corresponding
to 50 g available starch. Water (250 mL) was served with the
standardized breakfast meal.

The preparation of the test products is described elsewhere (24).

Research design. The study had a randomized crossover design of 8
single evening meal treatments (7 test meals and 1 reference meal. The
test meals were consumed in the evenings and the test markers were
collected in the next morning. At 2130 h in the evening prior to the
experimental day, the test participants consumed 1 of the 8 test bread
meals in random order on 8 occasions separated by ~1 wk. On the

2 of 5 Nilsson et al.

experimental days, volunteers attended the research department at 0745 h
after an overnight fast (;10 h). When arriving on the experimental days,
an i.v. cannula (BD Venﬂon, Becton Dickinson) was inserted into an
antecubital vein to be used for blood sampling. The standardized
breakfast (see the section above) was consumed at 0800 and the
participants were told to consume the breakfast within 10–12 min.

The participants were encouraged to standardize their meal pattern
and avoid foods rich in DF the day prior to each experimental day.
Furthermore, they should avoid alcohol and excessive physical exercise
in the evening and should not have consumed antibiotics or probiotics
during the previous 2 wk.

Chemical analyses and GI characteristics of the test products. The
test products were analyzed for total starch, RS, DF (soluble and
insoluble, excluding RS), and GI characteristics. The available starch
content was calculated by subtracting RS from total starch. The methods
used and the results are presented elsewhere (24).

Determination of plasma SCFA. Venous blood was collected into
tubes containing K2EDTA. The blood samples were withdrawn at fasting
immediately prior to the standardized breakfast and at 30 min after the
start of the breakfast. The tubes were centrifuged and plasma was
separated and stored in a freezer (,2208C) until analyzed. SCFA
(acetate, propionate, butyrate) were analyzed essentially as described in
(27) using 2-ethyl butyrate (Fluka No. 03190; Sigma Aldrich) as an
internal standard rather than iso-valeric acid.

Calculations and statistical methods. The study design was a within-
subjects design. SCFA concentrations were collected at time = 0 and at
time = 30 min. Differences in SCFA between the products at different
time points (time = 0 and time = 30 min) were analyzed by using a mixed
model (PROC MIXED in SAS release 8.01; SAS Institute) with repeated
measures and an autoregressive covariance structure. If nothing else is
stated in the “Results” section, further statistical calculations regarding
acetate, propionate, and butyrate were based on the means of the 2 time
points (time = 0 and at time = 30 min). Signiﬁcant differences in SCFA
concentrations dependent of the test meals were assessed using ANOVA
followed by Dunnett’s simultaneous test comparison method for
comparing test means to the WWB control by using MINITAB Statistical
Software (release 13.32; Minitab). Transformed data (Box Cox trans-
formation in MINITAB) were used in the SAS and MINITAB calcula-
tions. Generally, calculations were based on n = 15, 1 exception being the
calculations of results following the HBB evening meal (n = 14). The
results are expressed as means 6 SEM. Spearman rank correlation was
used to study relations between results of plasma SCFA and results of
relevant metabolic parameters reported previously (plasma glucose,
serum insulin, serum FFA, plasma GLP-1, breath hydrogen, satiety, and
GER) (24) and between plasma SCFA in the morning and amounts of
indigestible carbohydrates (DF and RS) included in the test evening
meals. Each participant obtained results emanating from 8 separate test
meals, with 1 exception (7 test meals; see above). For the correlation
calculations, a correlation for each participant was calculated and from
these values the mean of Spearman correlation coefﬁcient was obtained.
To determine the P-value, a permutation test was performed using
MATLAB with the null hypothesis that no correlations existed (the
alternative hypothesis was that the data were correlated). Differences of
P , 0.05 were considered signiﬁcant.

Results

Plasma SCFA concentrations. Plasma concentrations of
butyrate in the morning were affected by the test products
consumed the previous evening (P = 0.022). The evening test
meals affected the plasma butyrate concentrations at fasting and
30 min after commencing the standardized breakfast (P , 0.05).
Those composed of HAB and HBB resulted in higher concen-
trations the following morning than those with WWB (P , 0.05;
Table 1). Plasma butyrate and propionate concentrations
were higher at 30 min after the standardized breakfast (2.7 6

0.11 mmol/L and 8.0 6 0.17 mmol/L, respectively) than at time = 0
(2.1 6 0.08 mmol/L and 7.6 6 0.18 mmol/L, respectively) (P ,
0.01).

The concentrations of plasma SCFA in the morning were
positively correlated with the contents of indigestible carbohy-
drates included in the evening test meals (Table 2). Most
pronounced was the relation between indigestible carbohydrates
and plasma butyrate, but plasma acetate was also positively
correlated with the content of indigestible carbohydrates.

Relations between SCFA and metabolic test markers. The
results of plasma butyrate and acetate concentrations in the
mornings following the 8 different evening test meals were
inversely related to the postprandial glucose response [incre-
mental area under the curve (iAUC) 0–120 min; r = 20.26, P ,
0.01 and r = 20.20, P , 0.05, respectively] (24). Additionally,
the plasma butyrate concentrations at fasting were inversely
related to the serum insulin response (iAUC 0–120 min) (r =
20.19; P , 0.05). Plasma butyrate at 30 min and fasting
concentrations of serum FFA tended to be inversely correlated
(r = 20.22; P = 0.056).

Plasma butyrate (mean of 0 min and 30 min) was positively
related to the concentrations of breath hydrogen (mean excre-
tion 0–120 min after breakfast) (r = 0.30; P , 0.01).

Discussion

In this study, we report an increase in plasma butyrate concen-
trations in the morning following an evening meal composed of
barley kernel-based bread. As has been reported previously, with
the exception of the WWB + RS bread and the 1/2OB bread, all
evening test meals resulted in lower glucose response (iAUC 0–
120 min) at the following standardized breakfast compared with
the WWB evening meal (24). Due to inverse relations in the
previous study between breath hydrogen (breath hydrogen was
determined as a marker of colonic fermentation) and postpran-
dial glucose response (r = 20.25; P , 0.05) and GER (r = 20.24;
P , 0.05), and a positive relation between breath hydrogen and
satiety (r = 0.27; P , 0.01), it was put forward that beneﬁts to
metabolism can be mediated through colonic fermentation of
indigestible carbohydrates. The plasma butyrate concentrations
determined in this study were signiﬁcantly correlated to breath
hydrogen excretion obtained previously (r = 20.31; P , 0.01).

Although the evidence is indirect, SCFA produced during colonic
fermentation of indigestible carbohydrates are suggested to have
beneﬁcial effects on glucose metabolism (14,21,28). The results
obtained from the present study, showing an inverse relation
between postprandial glucose response and plasma butyrate,
support this concept.

The HAB and HBB evening meal breads resulted in signiﬁ-
cantly increased concentrations of plasma butyrate in the morn-
ing compared with a WWB evening meal. The HAB product was
characterized by high levels of RS (22 g/portion) and soluble DF
(5.2 g/portion, mostly b-glucans). Previous observations suggest
that b-glucans, but also RS, promote butyric acid production
upon colonic fermentation (15,29); thus, the elevated plasma
butyrate concentrations after HAB bread intake is in accordance
with previous studies. However, although the ingested amount of
barley DF and RS was considerably higher in the HBB compared
with all the other test products, this bread did not result in higher
concentrations of SCFA compared with the HAB. One explana-
tion for this discrepancy between the amount of indigestible
carbohydrates consumed in the evening and SCFA concentrations
in plasma in the morning could be a reduced transit time from
mouth to cecum caused by the high amounts of viscous DF in the
HBB (30,31). This makes it plausible that only a part of the
indigestible carbohydrates in the test meal had reached the colon
at the time of the standardized breakfast. Accordingly, there was
an increase in plasma levels of butyrate and propionate from the
fasted state to 30 min supporting an ongoing fermentation
process, suggesting that a time factor is important and that higher
concentrations of plasma SCFA levels might have been reached
later in the postprandial phase, as has been observed in pigs fed
wheat-, oat-, or rye-based bread (32,33).

A limitation in this study may be that the high amounts of
indigestible carbohydrates in the HBB resulted in a considerably
larger serving of this evening test meal compared with the other
meals. One of the participants failed to eat this meal and another
3 ﬁnished only ~75% of the serving. Two of the participants
reported mild stomachache and 2 participants reported mild
nausea after the HBB.

Even though previous results show conﬂicting results, e.g.
concerning effects of different SCFA, SCFA produced during
colonic fermentation of indigestible carbohydrates are suggested
to have beneﬁcial effects on glucose metabolism (15,16,21,28).
In contrast, others studies have failed to show beneﬁts of SCFA
on glucose metabolism in healthy participants following rectal
(34) or gastric (35) infusion of propionate, acetate, or a

Colonic fermentation and production of SCFA 3 of 5

combination of these. The mechanisms whereby colonic fer-
mentation of indigestible carbohydrates and formation of SCFA
may positively inﬂuence metabolic parameters are not clear, but
several possible mechanisms can be suggested. It is known that
circulating FFA is strongly connected to insulin sensitivity (36)
and glucose tolerance (16,24,37). Interestingly, our results show
a tendency (r = 222; P = 0.056) toward an inverse relation
between plasma butyrate concentrations at 30 min after the
standardized breakfast and fasting concentrations of serum FFA
[FFA determined in the previous study (24)]. Although not
observed in the present study, other possible mechanisms
whereby colonically derived SCFA may improve glucose toler-
ance are through a reduced motility in the gastrointestinal tract
and a lowered GER (38) or through a mechanism including
increased release of incretins (GLP-1) (39).

In conclusion, the results of this study show that it is possible
to increase the colonic production of SCFA in a semiacute
perspective (i.e. from an evening meal to the following morning)
by choice of cereal foods rich in barley DF and RS. Both the
quantity and the quality of the indigestible carbohydrates play a
role in the amounts and pattern of SCFA formed and delivered to
the circulation. As judged from the beneﬁts to glucose metab-
olism and related parameters in an overnight perspective, we put
forward that colonic production SCFA, and in particular
production of butyric acid, may be one mechanism by which
whole grain is protective against type 2 diabetes and cardiovas-
cular disease. Tailoring of prebiotics to reach different patterns
of colonically derived SCFA may therefore be important for the
design of food products with added beneﬁts on both glucose and
lipid metabolism. More research in this area is important to
clarify relations between colonic fermentation, SCFA produc-
tion, and metabolic beneﬁts.

Effect of Alcohol Consumption on Diabetes Mellitus
A Systematic Review
Andrea A. Howard, MD, MS; Julia H. Arnsten, MD, MPH; and Marc N. Gourevitch, MD, MPH

Background: Both diabetes mellitus and alcohol consumption
are prevalent in the United States, yet physicians are poorly in-
formed about how alcohol use affects risk for or management of
diabetes.
Purpose: To conduct a systematic review assessing the effect of
alcohol use on the incidence, management, and complications of
diabetes mellitus in adults.
Data Sources: English-language studies in persons 19 years of
age or older that were identified by searching the MEDLINE data-
base from 1966 to the third week of August 2003 and the refer-
ence lists of key articles.
Study Selection: Two independent assessors reviewed 974 re-
trieved citations to identify all experimental, cohort, or case–con-
trol studies that assessed the effect of alcohol use on diabetes risk,
control, self-management, adverse drug events, or complications.
Data Extraction: Two independent reviewers extracted data
and evaluated study quality on the basis of established criteria.

Data Synthesis: Thirty-two studies that met inclusion criteria
were reviewed. Compared with no alcohol use, moderate con-
sumption (one to 3 drinks/d) is associated with a 33% to 56%
lower incidence of diabetes and a 34% to 55% lower incidence of
diabetes-related coronary heart disease. Compared with moderate
consumption, heavy consumption (>3 drinks/d) may be associ-
ated with up to a 43% increased incidence of diabetes. Moderate
alcohol consumption does not acutely impair glycemic control in
persons with diabetes.

Conclusions: Moderate alcohol consumption is associated with
a decreased incidence of diabetes mellitus and a decreased inci-
dence of heart disease in persons with diabetes. Further studies
are needed to assess the long-term effects of alcohol consumption
on glycemic control and noncardiac complications in persons with
diabetes.

Diabetes mellitus is one of the most common chronic

diseases in the United States, affecting 7.8% of adults
20 years of age or older (1). The microvascular and macro-
vascular complications of diabetes make it the 6th leading
cause of death and a leading cause of blindness in the United
States (2). Successful long-term control of hyperglycemia
decreases the risk for diabetic complications (3). Although
a family history of diabetes is an established risk factor for
type 2 diabetes, lifestyle factors also play an important role
in its cause (4). For example, the incidence of diabetes has
been associated with physical inactivity and obesity, both of
which can be modiﬁed to decrease the risk for diabetes (5).
Alcohol consumption is also prevalent in the United
States: An estimated 109 million Americans 12 years of age
or older currently drink alcohol (6). Practicing physicians
are thus likely to encounter patients who use alcohol in
addition to having or being at risk for diabetes. Yet, phy-
sicians are poorly informed about how their patients’ alco-
hol use affects risk for or management of diabetes.

We performed a systematic review of the medical lit-
erature to assess the effects of alcohol consumption on 5
aspects of the epidemiology and treatment of diabetes: in-
cidence, glycemic control, adherence to therapy and self-
care behaviors, medication-associated complications, and
disease complications.

METHODS
Search Strategies

We searched the MEDLINE database for reports pub-
lished from 1966 to the third week of August 2003 by

using a search strategy developed in collaboration with a
medical librarian. The search was limited to English-lan-
guage studies of persons 19 years of age or older. We con-
ducted separate searches for the Medical Subject Headings
diabetes mellitus, hypoglycemic agents, and receptors, angio-
tensin/antagonists & inhibitors, combined with each of the
following Medical Subject Headings: ethanol, alcoholism,
alcoholic beverages, alcohol-related disorders, or alcohol drink-
ing. In addition, we manually searched the reference lists of
retrieved articles and relevant reviews.

Study Collection

Two reviewers independently assessed each MED-
LINE citation by using predeﬁned inclusion and exclusion
criteria. To be included, a study had to be an experimental,
cohort, or case– control study; include persons who had
been administered or were current users of alcohol; include
persons who had not been administered or were not users
of alcohol; and have a relevant primary outcome. For anal-
yses of the incidence of diabetes, the outcome was diabetes.
For glycemic control, outcomes were glucose and hemoglo-
bin A1c levels. For self-management behaviors, outcomes
were adherence to therapy, home glucose monitoring, diet,
and exercise. For medication complications, outcomes were
drug levels or adverse drug events. For diabetic complica-
tions, outcomes were acute complications, including dia-
betic ketoacidosis, hyperosmolar coma, infection, and am-
putation; chronic microvascular complications, including
retinopathy, peripheral neuropathy, nephropathy, and
erectile dysfunction; and chronic macrovascular complica-
tions, including coronary heart disease, cerebral vascular

Key Summary Points
Best evidence suggests that moderate alcohol consumption
is associated with a reduced incidence of diabetes mellitus.
Some evidence suggests that heavy alcohol use may be
associated with an increased incidence of diabetes mellitus.
There is no evidence of an acute effect of moderate
alcohol ingestion on glycemic control.
The effect of alcohol use on diabetes self-care behaviors
has not been well studied.
Limited evidence suggests that ingestion of alcohol while
using a sulfonylurea or thiazolidinedione does not result in
an adverse event.
Strong evidence shows that moderate alcohol consump-
tion is associated with a decreased incidence of coronary
heart disease in persons with diabetes.
Evidence is insufficient to establish the effect of alcohol
consumption on noncardiac complications in persons with
diabetes.

disease, and peripheral vascular disease. Experimental stud-
ies in which alcohol was administered to healthy volunteers
were considered beyond the scope of this review and were
excluded. We used SPSS software, version 10.1 (SPSS, Inc.,
Chicago, Illinois) to calculate ␬ agreement coefﬁcients.
Ratings between reviewers had 95% agreement (␬⫽ 0.75).
Reviewer disagreements were resolved by discussion after
review of the citation and the review protocol.
Assessment of Study Quality

Two reviewers independently rated the quality of each
study by using the criteria of the U.S. Preventive Services
Task Force for determining internal validity (7). For cohort
studies, these criteria include consideration of and adjust-
ment for potential confounders, maintenance of comparable
groups, a low rate of and nondifferential loss to follow-up,
use of valid measurements, use of clearly deﬁned interven-
tions, and consideration of important outcomes. For exper-
imental trials, these speciﬁcations also include adequate
randomization and intention-to-treat analysis. On the basis
of these criteria, we assigned each study one of the follow-
ing ratings: “good” (study meets all criteria well), “fair”
(study does not meet at least 1 criterion but has no limi-
tations that could invalidate its results), or “poor” (study
does not meet at least 1 criterion and has important limi-
tations). Studies that were found to be of poor quality were
excluded. Ratings between reviewers had 89% agreement
(␬⫽ 0.76). Reviewer disagreements were resolved by con-
sensus after review of the article and the review protocol.
Data Extraction

From each included study, 2 investigators abstracted
data on the study sample, study duration, alcohol dose or
deﬁnition of alcohol exposure, deﬁnition and method of
measuring outcome, confounders for which the investiga-
tors controlled, and measure of association.

212 3 February 2004 Annals of Internal Medicine Volume 140 • Number 3

To aid in comparing results across studies, we converted
the measures of alcohol consumption to a single scale when-
ever possible, in which one drink was equivalent to 12.6 g
of ethanol. This conversion was based on the U.S. Depart-
ment of Agriculture deﬁnition of a standard drink (8).

Role of the Funding Source

The funding source had no role in the collection, anal-
ysis, or interpretation of the data or in the decision to
submit the manuscript for publication.

DATA SYNTHESIS
Search Results

We identiﬁed 974 studies. Of these, 942 were ex-
cluded because they did not meet the predeﬁned selection
criteria (Figure). Of the 32 included studies, 27 were stud-
ies of type 2 diabetes only (8 –34), 2 were studies of both
type 1 and type 2 diabetes (35, 36), and 3 did not specify
the type of diabetes (37–39). No included study assessed
the effects of alcohol consumption on diabetes self-care
behaviors or on diabetic complications other than coronary
heart disease and retinopathy.

Association of Alcohol Consumption and Diabetes
Incidence

Eighteen prospective cohort studies assessed the asso-
ciation between alcohol consumption and the incidence of
diabetes (Appendix Table, available at www.annals.org).
Alcohol consumption was categorized in numerous ways,
including times per week, grams per week or per day,
drinks or units per week, and milliliters or ounces per day.
The method by which diabetes was measured also varied,
in part because of the change in American Diabetes Asso-
ciation criteria for the diagnosis of diabetes in 1997 (40).
Six studies used oral glucose tolerance tests (10, 13, 14, 17,
18, 21), 11 used fasting glucose levels (10, 13, 14, 16 –21,
24, 25), and one used random glucose levels (16). Seven
studies used self-report of diabetes (8, 9, 11, 15, 22, 23) or
use of hypoglycemic medication (12) as the only measure
of diabetes incidence. In 2 studies, the outcome included
impaired fasting glucose and diabetes (19, 20), and in one
study, the outcome was worsening glucose tolerance (pro-
gression from normal glucose tolerance to impaired glucose
tolerance or diabetes, or progression from impaired glucose
tolerance to diabetes) (17).

All studies were rated “fair.” A limitation of many
studies was that a standard screening test was not used to
diagnose diabetes (8, 9, 11, 12, 15, 22, 23). Another com-
mon limitation was that alcohol intake was assessed at
baseline only (9 –11, 13, 14, 16 –19, 21, 22, 25). Several
studies dichotomized alcohol consumption and did not
distinguish moderate from heavy alcohol use (11, 13, 20,
24). In addition, many studies failed to control for impor-
tant confounders, including waist-to-hip ratio, family his-
tory of diabetes, and race.

Six studies used both an objective measure of diabetes

Alcohol Consumption and Diabetes Mellitus

Review

incidence and a nondichotomous categorical measure of
alcohol consumption (10, 16, 17, 19, 21, 25). Five of these
studies (10, 16, 19, 21, 25) and 3 additional studies (12,
22, 23) found a U-shaped relationship between alcohol
consumption and incidence of diabetes, with moderate
drinkers having the lowest risk for diabetes and nondrink-
ers and heavy drinkers having a higher risk. Compared
with nondrinkers, persons who consumed approximately
one to 3 drinks daily had a 33% to 56% reduction in the
risk for diabetes. Compared with moderate drinkers, per-
sons who consumed more than 3 drinks daily had up to a
43% greater risk for diabetes; however, this difference was
statistically signiﬁcant in only 2 studies (19, 25). The study
that assessed impaired glucose tolerance and diabetes found
no association between alcohol use and worsening glucose
tolerance (17).

Three studies found an inverse relationship between
alcohol consumption and diabetes incidence, with moder-
ate drinkers having a 43% to 46% reduction in risk for
diabetes compared with nondrinkers (8, 9, 15). In each of
these studies, the prevalence of heavy drinking was low
(1% to 3%), and power may have thus been insufﬁcient to
detect a relationship between heavy alcohol use and diabe-
tes. The quantity of alcohol associated with the lowest risk
for diabetes in these studies ranged from about one drink daily

www.annals.org

in women (15) to about 3 drinks daily in men (8). These
studies are consistent with those reporting a U-shaped re-
lationship between alcohol consumption and diabetes inci-
dence.

Alcohol consumption was treated as a dichotomous
variable in 4 studies. Two of these studies found no asso-
ciation between alcohol use and risk for diabetes (11, 13).
One study reported an increased risk in persons who drank
alcohol more than 2 to 3 times weekly (20). Another study
found an increased risk for diabetes with current alcohol
use in persons with a low body mass index (ⱕ22 kg/m2)
and a decreased risk in those with a normal body mass
index (22.1 to 24.9 kg/m2) (24). Two studies treated alco-
hol consumption as a continuous variable and found a
positive association with a risk for diabetes in men but no
association in women (14, 18).

Effect of Alcohol Consumption on Glycemic Control

Six experimental studies assessed the effect of alcohol
consumption on glycemic control in persons with type 1
(35) or type 2 (26 –29, 35, 37) diabetes. All of these studies
included only 5 to 20 adults, and all were rated “fair.” The
ethanol dose ranged from approximately 1 to 2 drinks (27–
29, 37) to 5 to 6 drinks (26, 35). Three studies were
conducted after fasting (27–29). Ethanol was ingested with

our inclusion criteria assessed the interaction of alcohol
and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in persons
with diabetes.

In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group
study in 23 patients with diet-controlled diabetes, partici-
pants were randomized to receive 200 mg of troglitazone
or placebo daily for 45 days (30). On days 42 and 45,
participants underwent a single-blind, crossover, placebo-
controlled alcohol challenge test (0.6 g/kg ethanol [equiv-
alent to 3 drinks] in orange juice, or orange juice alone)
with a meal. The glycemic response to alcohol over 4 hours

did not signiﬁcantly differ between the 2 groups, and no
serious adverse events were noted.

In a crossover study, 0.5 g of ethanol per kg of body
weight (about 2.5 drinks) was administered to 5 groups of
10 persons with type 2 diabetes before and after 10 days of
treatment with a sulfonylurea derivative (31). Chlorpro-
pamide was found to decrease the rate of ethanol elim-
ination from the blood. However, no signiﬁcant difference
was found in the glycemic response to ethanol over 6
hours. Neither study discussed the adequacy of the sample
size.

Alcohol Consumption and Incidence of Diabetic
Complications
Coronary Heart Disease

Four prospective cohort studies assessed the relation-
ship between alcohol consumption and the incidence of
coronary heart disease (32, 33, 38) or death (32–34, 38) in
diabetic persons (Table). One of these studies was nested
within a randomized clinical trial (38). The diagnosis of
diabetes was determined by self-report in 3 studies (32, 33,
38) and by medical chart review in one study (34).

Ascertainment of alcohol consumption varied among
studies. Alcohol consumption was expressed as grams per
day (32, 34), drinks per day (33), or frequency of con-
sumption (38). In classifying nondrinkers, one study dis-
tinguished former drinkers from lifetime abstainers (34).

The method of outcome assessment also varied. Death
due to coronary heart disease was conﬁrmed by death cer-
tiﬁcates (34, 38) or medical records and autopsy reports
(32, 33). Incident coronary heart disease was deﬁned as
cases of myocardial infarction only (32, 33) or included
patients who underwent coronary artery bypass graft or
percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (38).

Two studies were rated “good” (33, 38), and 2 were
rated “fair” (32, 34). A common limitation was that alco-
hol consumption was assessed only at baseline (34, 38). In
some studies, coronary heart disease was inconsistently
measured; although most cases were conﬁrmed by medical
records, some were ascertained only through self-report
and veriﬁcation of hospitalization (32, 33).

Each study reported a decreased risk for death due to
coronary heart disease in association with alcohol use; in 3
of the studies, the results were statistically signiﬁcant (32,
34, 38). All 3 studies that assessed the incidence of coro-
nary heart disease demonstrated an inverse association be-
tween alcohol consumption and risk for coronary heart
disease; in 2 of the studies, the results were statistically
signiﬁcant (32, 33). Compared with nondrinkers, moder-
ate drinkers had a 34% to 55% decrease in the incidence of
coronary heart disease and a 55% to 79% decrease in the
rate of death from coronary heart disease.

Diabetic Retinopathy

Two prospective cohort studies assessed the association
between alcohol consumption and risk for retinopathy
(Table). One study comprised men recruited from a dia-
betes clinic (39), and one included a population-based
sample of men and women with diabetes (36). Both studies
assessed alcohol consumption at baseline only. One study
deﬁned “heavy drinking” as consumption of more than 10
pints of beer or the equivalent weekly (39), and one ex-
pressed the odds of retinopathy per ounce of alcohol con-
sumed daily (36). The prevalence of heavy drinking dif-
fered between the studies, as did the method of outcome
assessment (direct ophthalmoscopy [39] or stereoscopic
fundus photography [36]).

216 3 February 2004 Annals of Internal Medicine Volume 140 • Number 3

One study (rated “good”) found no association be-
tween alcohol consumption and incidence or progression
of diabetic retinopathy (36), whereas the other study (rated
“fair”) found an increased risk for diabetic retinopathy
with heavy alcohol use (39).

DISCUSSION

We performed a systematic review of the literature to
assess the effect of alcohol consumption on risk for and
management and complications of diabetes mellitus. The
best evidence suggests that moderate alcohol consumption
is associated with a decreased risk for diabetes, whereas
heavy alcohol consumption may be associated with an in-
creased risk. Furthermore, ingestion of moderate amounts
of alcohol appears to have no acute effect on glycemic
control in persons with diabetes. We found no studies that
assessed the effects of alcohol use on diabetes self-care be-
haviors. Limited data suggest that alcohol ingestion along
with use of a sulfonylurea or thiazolidinedione does not
increase the risk for an adverse drug event. Our analysis
demonstrates that mild to moderate alcohol consumption
in persons with diabetes is associated with a decrease in
cardiovascular events. However, the effect of alcohol use on
other diabetic complications, including retinopathy, ne-
phropathy, and neuropathy, remains uncertain.

Although the results of the included studies did not all
agree, the balance of evidence suggests that there is a U-
shaped relationship between alcohol consumption and risk
for diabetes. Compared with nondrinkers, moderate drink-
ers (those who consume one to 3 drinks daily) have a 33%
to 56% lower risk for diabetes. In addition, some evidence
suggests that compared with moderate drinkers, persons
who consume more than 3 drinks daily have up to a 43%
greater risk for diabetes. An association between light to
moderate alcohol consumption and lower risk for diabetes
is biologically plausible. Development of insulin resistance
is a key factor in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes (41),
and light to moderate drinking has been associated with
enhanced insulin sensitivity in several observational studies
(42– 44). However, moderate alcohol consumption may be
a marker for a healthy lifestyle that investigators did not
entirely account for by adjusting for physical activity and
diet. The association between heavy alcohol use and in-
creased risk for diabetes in some studies may have been
mediated by an increase in obesity, and particularly in
truncal adiposity, which is a strong risk factor for type 2
diabetes (45). Although many studies controlled for body
mass index, most did not control for anthropometric indi-
ces more closely correlated with intra-abdominal obesity,
such as waist-to-hip ratio.

The epidemiologic studies included in our review had
several important limitations. The methods of diagnosing
diabetes were inconsistent among studies, and many stud-
ies used self-report of a diabetes diagnosis or use of a hy-
poglycemic medication rather than a standard screening

www.annals.org

nosed cases in these samples, misclassiﬁcation of undiag-
nosed cases is still likely to have occurred, because as many
as 44% of Americans with type 2 diabetes have undiag-
nosed disease (1). If heavy drinkers were more likely than
more moderate drinkers or nondrinkers to be screened for
diabetes by using an objective test, differential misclassiﬁ-
cation may have contributed to the observed increase in
risk for diabetes associated with heavy drinking in some
studies.

Methods of measuring alcohol consumption were also
inconsistent among studies. Lack of a standardized measure
of alcohol use complicates the interpretation of ﬁndings
across studies, especially since some investigators used fre-
quency of consumption rather than quantity consumed. In
addition, many longitudinal studies assessed alcohol con-
sumption only at baseline, whereas some repeated measures
of alcohol consumption. Most studies combined lifetime
abstainers and former drinkers into one “nondrinker” ref-
erent group rather than analyzing the risk for diabetes in
these 2 groups separately. Combining these groups could
introduce bias because if many of the former drinkers
stopped using alcohol for health reasons, an artifactual pro-
tective effect of alcohol use would result (46). Finally, the
distribution of alcohol consumption differed among the
study samples. For example, several studies contained few
heavy drinkers and were thus underpowered to detect a
relationship between heavy drinking and the incidence of
diabetes.

Our review suggests that consumption of a moderate
amount of alcohol does not acutely impair glycemic con-
trol in persons with diabetes. In fact, the data suggest that
alcohol consumption may result in a small decrease in
plasma glucose concentration in persons with type 1 or
type 2 diabetes. This decrease may be the result of en-
hanced insulin secretion, or reduced hepatic gluconeogen-
esis (35). However, data on the long-term effects of alcohol
consumption on glycemic control are lacking, and further
research is needed.

We found no studies that addressed the effects of
alcohol use on diabetes self-care behaviors,
including
medication adherence, home glucose monitoring, diet, or
exercise. Heavy alcohol use may adversely affect diabetes
self-care behaviors because it is associated with nonadher-
ence to medical therapy in other chronic disease states,
such as HIV infection (47). Given the importance of ad-
herence in decreasing diabetes-associated morbidity and
mortality, research is needed to assess the effect of alcohol
use on self-care behaviors in persons with diabetes.

Few studies have assessed the effect of alcohol con-
sumption on complications of medical therapy. However,
the available data suggest that consumption of 2 to 3
drinks while taking a sulfonylurea or thiazolidinedione
does not result in adverse events. Of note, chlorpropamide
decreases the rate of ethanol clearance (31). Although we
found no well-conducted studies of the effect of alcohol on

www.annals.org

Alcohol Consumption and Diabetes Mellitus

Review

complications of biguanide therapy, clinicians should be
aware of the black-box warning that cautions against exces-
sive alcohol intake while taking metformin, because alco-
hol use potentiates the risk for lactic acidosis (48).

Our review demonstrates that among persons with di-
abetes, mild to moderate alcohol consumption is associated
with a 34% to 55% decrease in risk for coronary heart
disease and a 55% to 79% decrease in risk for death from
coronary heart disease. This ﬁnding is in concordance with
epidemiologic studies conducted in general populations
that have consistently demonstrated an inverse association
between moderate alcohol consumption and coronary
heart disease (49). The apparent protective effect of alcohol
may result from the increase in high-density lipoprotein
cholesterol level (50), decrease in platelet aggregation (51),
or increase in ﬁbrinolytic activity (52) associated with al-
cohol consumption. These beneﬁcial effects of alcohol are
particularly relevant in diabetic persons, in whom coronary
risk factors (such as dyslipidemia) and a predilection to
thrombosis are highly prevalent. The effect of alcohol use
on the risk for noncardiac diabetic complications, includ-
ing retinopathy, remains uncertain. Although polyneurop-
athy is a common complication of alcoholism (53), good-
quality studies that assess the effect of alcohol use on
diabetic neuropathy are lacking.

In summary, moderate alcohol consumption appears
to be associated with a reduced risk for diabetes, whereas
some evidence suggests that heavy alcohol consumption
may be associated with an increased risk. Among persons
with diabetes, ingestion of moderate amounts of alcohol
appears to have no acute effect on glycemic control. The
effect of alcohol use on diabetes self-care behaviors has not
been studied. Limited data suggest that alcohol consump-
tion in persons with diabetes is not associated with com-
plications of medical therapy. Furthermore, among persons
with diabetes, mild to moderate alcohol consumption is
associated with a decreased risk for cardiovascular events.
On the basis of these data, it is reasonable for physicians to
inform patients with diabetes who already drink alcohol
that moderate alcohol consumption (one to 3 drinks daily)
does not appear to be associated with adverse outcomes.
However, because most of the available evidence is obser-
vational, these data cannot support recommendation of al-
cohol consumption to persons with or at risk for diabetes
who do not currently drink. Given the high prevalence of
both diabetes and alcohol consumption in the United
States, further research is needed to determine the long-
term effects of alcohol consumption on glycemic control,
self-management behaviors, and noncardiac complications
of diabetes mellitus.

responses

The concept of the glycemic index (GI) was ﬁrst introduced in
1981 [1] and is a classiﬁcation of the blood glucose-raising
potential of carbohydrates in foods. It is deﬁned as the ratio
between the
to isoavailable
carbohydrate-containing portions of a test and reference food
(calculated as the incremental areas under the curve [IAUCs])
and expressed as a percentage [2]. Many studies have investi-
gated the potential health beneﬁts of low-GI foods. Today, there
is an important body of evidence to support the therapeutic
potential of low-GI diets, not only in diabetes [3,4] but also in
hyperlipidemia [5] and cardiovascular diseases [6]. In addition,
low-GI foods have been beneﬁcially associated with prolonged

The study was funded by Oxford Brookes University.

Objective: The postprandial glycemic response and glycemic index (GI) of spaghetti made with
semolina and the addition of two b-glucan barley concentrates, Glucagel (GG) and Barley Balance
(BB), was studied.
Methods: For each type of b-glucan concentrate, six spaghetti samples containing increasing
percentages (0%, 2%, 4%, 6%, 8%, and 10%) of b-glucan were made. Nine healthy subjects were
recruited for measuring the glycemic response and GI. Subjects were served portions of the test
foods (50 g of available carbohydrates) and a reference food (50 g of glucose) on separate occasions.
Capillary blood glucose was measured up to 120 min after consuming the spaghetti. The total
glycemic response was calculated geometrically as the incremental areas under the curve (IAUC)
using the trapezoid rule. The GI was calculated geometrically by expressing the IAUC for the test
food as a percentage of each subject’s average IAUC for the glucose.
Results: The IAUC for spaghetti with and without b-glucan was signiﬁcantly less compared with
glucose. The GG spaghetti had IAUC values similar to the spaghetti without b-glucan concentrate.
The BB spaghetti showed IAUC values lower than that of the spaghetti without b-glucan. In
particular, the spaghetti with 10% BB had an IAUC 52% lower (P  0.017) than the spaghetti with
b-glucan. The GI values for spaghetti with GG were statistically similar to the control. The GI of BB
spaghetti decreased with increasing BB concentrations. In particular, the GI of 10% BB spaghetti was
54% lower (P 0.02; GI ¼ 29) than that of the control (GI ¼ 64).
Conclusion: The BB concentrate signiﬁcantly decreases the IAUC and GI of spaghetti at a dose of
10%. GI at the same concentrations does not.

endurance during physical activity [7], with improved insulin
sensitivity [8], reduced food intake [9], and increased colonic
fermentation [10]. Several studies have been carried out to
evaluate the GI of pasta. Aston et al. [11] determined the GI of
penne and egg tagliatelle. The starch digestibility in vitro and
glucose response in vivo of gluten-free pasta were determined
[12]. Henry at al. [13] studied the impact of the addition of top-
pings/ﬁllings on the GR to pasta. The potential GI of fresh pastas
added with commercially available dietary ﬁbers has been
evaluated using an in vitro model [14]. Cleary and Brennan [15]
evaluated the potential GI in vitro and the physicochemical
properties of durum wheat spaghetti enriched with a (1 / 3)
(1 / 4)-b-D-glucan–rich fraction from barley. The poly-
saccharide (1 / 3) (1 / 4)-b-D-glucan, commonly referred to as
b-glucan, is a major constituent of the cell walls in the oat and
barley endosperms. The primary structure of b-glucan is a linear
polymer of D-glucopyranosyl units linked by isolated b-(1 / 3)
linkages or groups of b-(1 / 4) linkages [16]. Unlike cellulose,

which is quite stiff, the b-(1 / 3) linkages in b-glucan are
described as a wormlike coil and also water-soluble [17].
b-Glucan has previously been shown to lower blood cholesterol
levels in animal and human trials and the GR [18]. In 2005, the
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorized the use of barley
as a functional food. The presence of 0.75 g of b-glucan per
serving in a food allowed it to be accompanied by the health
claim that the product will decrease the risk of coronary heart
disease. The FDA moreover ruled that 3 g/d of barley b-glucans is
a sufﬁcient dietary intake to achieve a decrease in serum total
and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [19]. The effect of
b-glucan on blood glucose and insulin levels has been evaluated
in several studies (using porridge, ﬂakes, and ﬂour) derived from
normal or high-ﬁber oat and barley genotypes or containing
extracted b-glucan fractions [20,21]. Barley ﬂour fractions
enriched with b-glucan have been used in mixtures with wheat
ﬂour and semolina to produce baked products and pasta with
acceptable sensory properties and with a lower GI than durum
wheat pasta containing the same amount of available carbohy-
drates [22,23]. Thondre and Henry [24] found that adding barley
long-chain b-glucan signiﬁcantly decreased the in vivo GR of
chapatis. Kim et al.
[25] studied the glucose and insulin
responses to whole grain breakfasts containing wheat and/or
barley providing varying amounts of b-glucan. Nazare et al. [26]
investigated the modulation of blood glucose and insulin
responses during the postprandial phase by b-glucan in over-
weight subjects. b-Glucan is postulated to decrease the
GR by increasing the viscosity of
food. Food viscosity has
been previously shown to have an inverse relation with
gastric-empting rate, transition time, and absorption [27]. The
viscosity exerted by b-glucan depends on its concentration and
molecular weight [28].

Glucagel (GG) and Barley Balance (BB) are commercial
b-glucan concentrates. The former (>75% b-glucan) is produced
using an all-natural water extraction and freeze-thaw isolation
process, and the latter (about 25% b-glucan) is made using a dry
process from waxy, hulled barley. The b-glucan contained in GG
has a low molecular weight (150 000 Da) compared with BB,
which has a higher molecular weight (650 000–700 000 Da).

The study hypothesized that the addition of these two
concentrates would correspondingly decrease the GR and GI to
spaghetti at increasing concentrations. Although BB and GG are
widely used in the food industry as fortiﬁers, no studies have
investigated their speciﬁc effect on the GR and GI. Because GG
and BB are produced in dissimilar ways and contain b-glucan of
differing molecular weights, we believed it prudent to carry out
the present study in an attempt to comparatively investigate
their effects on the GR and GI.

The objective of this research was to evaluate the inﬂuence of
two types of barley b-glucan concentrate, GG and BB, on the
postprandial GR and GI of semolina spaghetti.

Materials and methods

Subject

Nine healthy subjects (three men and six women) took part in the present
study at Oxford Brookes University (Oxford, UK). The subjects consisted entirely
of staff and students (undergraduate and postgraduate). Exclusion criteria
were an age younger than 18 y or older than 60 y, body mass index greater than
30 kg/m2, and a fasting blood glucose value higher than 6.1 mmol/L. Before
inclusion in the study, potential participants were screened using a health
questionnaire, where they provided details of food allergies, intolerances, and
any genetic and metabolic conditions. The subjects were given full details of the
study protocol and the opportunity to ask questions. All subjects gave written
informed consent before participation. Ethical approval for the study was

obtained from the university research ethics committee of Oxford Brookes
University. Anthropometric measurements were taken for all subjects in the
fasting state using standardized methods before the beginning of the study.
Height was recorded to the nearest centimeter using a stadiometer (Seca Ltd.,
Birmingham, UK) with the subjects standing without shoes. Weight and body fat
were recorded using Tanita BC-418 MA (Tanita UK Ltd., Yiewsley, Middlesex, UK)
body composition analysis with the subjects wearing light clothing and no shoes.
Body mass index was calculated as weight (kilograms) divided by height (meters)
squared. Waist circumference was measured with an anthropometric tape
measure (Seca Ltd.) at the midpoint between the coastal margins of the ribs and
the upper margin of the iliac crest.

Raw materials

Durum wheat semolina (Gran Mugnaio, Molino Spadoni, Italy) was purchased
from a local market. It contained 71% carbohydrates, 13% protein, 1% lipid, 1% ash,
and 14% moisture. The semolina composition was derived from information
provided by the manufacturer. Two b-glucan barley concentrates, GG and BB
(DKSH Great Britain Ltd., London, UK) were used. GG had 79.4% b-glucan, 5.94%
non–b-glucan carbohydrate, 5.2% protein 2.8% lipid,1.5% ash, and 14% moisture. BB
contained 26.5% b-glucan, 10% other dietary ﬁber, 34% starch, 16% protein, 1.9%
lipid, 2% ash, and 6% moisture. The dough was prepared using tap water. Glucose
(dextrose monohydrate; Lloyds Pharmacy Ltd., Coventry, UK) was used as the
reference food.

Spaghetti preparation

Spaghetti samples were prepared using a pasta machine (Simac PastaMatic
1400N1, BellaItalia Srl, Conegliano, Italy) equipped with a bronze head. The
spaghetti samples containing different percentages of GG were denoted as 0GG,
2GG, 4GG, 6GG, 8GG, and 10GG. The samples with BB were denoted as 0BB, 2BB,
4BB, 6BB, 8BB, and 10BB. The formulations of all spaghetti samples made are
listed in Table 1. The semolina and barley concentrates were mixed for 5 min
before adding water to promote better homogeneity between semolina and
b-glucan. The percentage of absorbed water was evaluated based on the
appearance and handling properties of the dough before extrusion. The condi-
tions applied were a water temperature of 41C, a kneading time of 20 min, and
desiccation for 24 h at ambient temperature. The spaghetti samples were cooked
individually in 1000 mL of water at optimal cooking tome (OCT; Table 1) and
served to the subject within 5 min of preparation.

Optimal cooking time

The OCT was evaluated every 30 s during cooking by observing the time of
disappearance of the spaghetti core when squeezed between two transparent
glass slides according to Approved Method 66-50 [29].

Study protocol

The GI was measured using the protocol adapted from that described by
Brouns et al. [30] and the Food and Agriculture Organization/World Health
Organization (FAO/WHO) [2]. The FAO/WHO recommends using a minimum of
six subjects to determine the GI of a food. On the day before a test, subjects were
asked to restrict their intake of alcohol and caffeine-containing drinks and to
restrict their participation in intense physical activity (e.g., long periods at the
gym, intensive swimming, running, aerobics). The participants came to the
laboratory from 07:00 to 08:30 h. Upon arrival, they were ﬁrst allowed to rest for
10 min before testing. Before testing the participants ﬁlled in a questionnaire
giving details of their previous evening meal, physical activity, and stress levels
and, in the case of women, the days since the beginning of their menstrual cycle.
The spaghetti samples were tested as 50 g of available carbohydrate equiva-
lents (Table 1) and compared with the reference food (glucose). In accordance with
FAO/WHO [2] recommendations, the subjects tested each spaghetti sample once
and the reference food three times in random order on separate days, with a gap of
at least 1 d between measurements to minimize carryover effects. After obtaining
the baseline blood glucose measurements, the subjects consumed the reference/
test food at a comfortable pace, within 15 min. A glass of water (200 mL) was
served with the test and reference foods. Subjects were encouraged to keep
physical activity to a minimum during the testing.

Blood glucose measurements

Blood samples were obtained by ﬁngerprick using the Unistik 3 single-use
lancing device (Owen Mumford, Woodstock, UK). Fasting blood samples were
taken at  5 and 0 min and the reference/test food was consumed immediately
afterward. Further blood samples were taken at 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, and 120 min
after the commencement of eating. Before a ﬁngerprick, subjects were encour-
aged to warm their hands to increase blood ﬂow. Fingers were gently massaged

starting from the base of the hand moving toward the tips. They were not
squeezed to extract blood from the ﬁngertip to minimize plasma dilution. The
ﬁrst two drops of expressed blood were discarded and the next drop was used for
testing. Blood glucose was measured using the HemoCue Glucose 201þ analyzer
(HemoCue Ltd., Dronﬁeld, UK). To ensure accuracy of the data, the HemoCue
glucose analyzers were calibrated daily against a YSI 2300 Stat glucose analyzer
(YSI Inc., Yellow Springs, OH, USA). The HemoCue has been previously shown to
be a reliable method of measuring blood glucose concentrations [31].

Calculation of GR and GI

The total GR was calculated geometrically as the IUAC (ignoring the area
below baseline) using the trapezoidal rule [2]. The GI was calculated as the ratio
between the IUAC for the test food and the mean IUAC for the reference and
expressed as a percentage. The GI and GR were calculated on an individual basis
for each participant. The mean of all participants was adopted as the GR and GI
value for each treatment. For each treatment in each b-glucan type, the GR at
every time point (15, 30, 45, 60, 90, and 120 min) was compared with that of the
reference.

Statistical analysis

Data are presented as means, standard deviations, and standard errors,
where appropriate. Intraindividual variations in the GR to the reference glucose
test were expressed as the coefﬁcient of variation (percentage; 100  standard
deviation by mean). Between-treatments effects were analyzed using the
repeated measures analysis of variance. Data for GG and BB were analyzed
separately. Where signiﬁcant differences were observed, post hoc multiple
pairwise comparisons were carried out using the Tukey test. Statistical signiﬁ-
cance was set at P  0.05. The results from ANOVA analyses were expressed as
F values with the corresponding treatment and error degrees of freedom, and the
P values. The corresponding P value is given alongside. Normality of data was
tested using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic. Data were analyzed using SPSS
17.0 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).

Results

Results for spaghetti are reported in Table 1. The OCT for all
the treatments made with GG was 5 min. The OCT for pasta with
BB increased with increasing b-glucan concentrations. The 10BB
sample had an OCT 1.5 min higher than that of 2BB.
The anthropometric data for men and women were within the
acceptable normal ranges. Mean baseline data  standard devi-
ation of the subjects were age 35  11.6 y, height 1.68  0.07 m,
weight 70.0  14.7 kg, body mass index 21.7  4.1 kg/m2, body fat
29.5  10.8%, waist circumference 61.0  7.7 cm, and fasting blood
glucose 4.9  0.3 mmol/L. The mean coefﬁcient of variation of the
GR to the three standard tests for the nine subjects was 20%. BB
spaghetti in comparison had lower GI values.

Figure 1a presents the GR to the GG spaghetti (0GG, 2GG,
4GG, 6GG, 8GG, and 10GG) and the reference food (glucose).

Compared with the reference, the GR was signiﬁcantly less for
all spaghetti types at 15 min (F6,56 ¼ 11.81, P  0.001), 30 min
(F6,56 ¼ 5.85, P  0.001), and 45 min (F6,56 ¼ 4.39, P  0.001).

Spaghetti with BB demonstrated a decrease in the GI with
increasing BB concentrations (F5,43 ¼ 4.05, P  0.04). Post hoc
comparison showed that the GI of 10BB (29%) was signiﬁcantly
lower (55% less, P  0.02) compared with 0BB (GI ¼ 64).

At 60 min, 0GG and 2GG showed a blood glucose change similar
to the reference food, whereas 4GG, 6GG, 8GG, and 10GG had
a GR signiﬁcantly lower than that of glucose (F6,56 ¼ 3.38, P 
0.006). These spaghettis showed a similar GR to glucose at 90
and 120 min. Moreover, the peak blood glucose value was
reached at 30 min for the reference and for spaghetti with GG
concentrate. In addition, with all treatments, the blood glucose
levels after 60 min showed a gradual decrease. At 120 min, all
spaghetti
treatments elicited blood glucose concentrations
above the baseline value.

Figure 1b shows the GR to the BB spaghetti (0BB, 2BB, 4BB,
6BB, 8BB, and 10BB) and the reference food (glucose). For
all spaghettis, the GR was signiﬁcantly less at 15 min (F6,51 ¼
28.25, P  0.001), 30 min (F6,51 ¼ 24.25, P  0.001), and 45 min
(F6,51 ¼ 9.54, P  0.001). At 60 min, 0GG showed a blood glucose
change similar to the reference food. In contrast, 4GG, 6GG, 8GG,
and 10GG produced a GR signiﬁcantly less than that of glucose
(F6,51 ¼ 7.73, P  0.001). All spaghetti treatments exhibited
a blood glucose change similar to that of glucose at 90 and
120 min. The peak blood glucose value, moreover, was reached at
30 min for the reference and at 45 min for spaghetti with BB. This
was more evident for 8BB and 10BB. With all treatments, the
blood glucose levels began to gradually decrease after 60. As for
GG spaghetti, all treatments with BB showed blood glucose
levels above the baseline value at the end of 120 min.

Tables 2 and 3 list the IAUC values for the reference and
spaghetti with different levels (0, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10) of GG and BB.
The IAUC values for spaghetti with GG were statistically lower
that those of glucose (F5,52 ¼ 10.15, P  0.001). The mean
percentage decrease in IAUC for GG spaghetti compared with
glucose was 47%. The IAUC values of GG spaghetti were similar to
that of the control (Table 3). The 6GG and 10GG samples,
however, had IAUC values 32.6% and 29.5% lower compared with
0GG, respectively. The IAUC values of BB spaghetti were signiﬁ-
cantly lower than those of the reference food (glucose; F6,48 ¼
16.17, P  0.001). The mean percentage decrease in IAUC for BB
spaghetti compared with glucose was 60%. It is noteworthy that
IAUC values decreased with increasing percentages of BB. For
example, 2BB spaghetti showed a decrease of 19% compared
with 0BB. However, only the 10BB showed a signiﬁcant decrease
in IAUC (51.6%, P  0.017) compared with 0BB.

The GI values for spaghetti with GG and BB b-glucan
concentrates are presented in Figures 2a and 2b, respectively.
The spaghetti treatments with GG showed a slight decrease in GI
compared with 0GG. This decrease was not signiﬁcant.

Discussion

In the present study, the mean coefﬁcient of variation of the
GR to the three standard tests for the nine subjects was 20%. A
variation of 16% to 35% in the GR subjects to the three reference
tests is acceptable [32].

The GR to all the spaghetti treatments was signiﬁcantly lower
than the reference food (glucose). These results are in agreement
with those reported by Behall et al. [33].

In the present study, spaghetti samples were made using
semolina enriched with different levels (0%, 2%, 4%, 6%, 8%, and
10%) of two types of b-glucan concentrate, GG and BB. A decrease
in the GR and GI of semolina spaghetti with BB concentrate, but
not with GG, was observed. The GI of carbohydrate foods varied
from 20 to 100, thereby allowing their classiﬁcation as low (GI
<55), medium (GI >55 to <70), and high (GI >70) GI foods [34].
Spaghetti without b-glucan concentrate had a GI of 64. GG
spaghetti had GI values varying from 64 (2GG) to 51 (10GG) and
BB spaghetti had GI values from 51 (2BB) to 29 (10BB). These
values classify the test spaghetti as medium and low GI.

The functional properties of b-glucans have been attributed to
their ability to increase lumen viscosity [35–37]. It has been
suggested that cereal b-glucan, by increasing the viscosity of the
gastrointestinal tract contents, delays gastric emptying and the
intestinal absorption of nutrients such as digestible carbohy-
drates and thereby decreases postprandial glycemia and insulin
secretion [38]. Battilana et al. [35] found that the administration
of frequent meals with or without b-glucan resulted in a similar
carbohydrate metabolism, whereas ingestion of a single meal
containing b-glucan lowered postprandial glucose concentra-
tions. This might suggest that the beneﬁcial action of b-glucan is
mainly due to delayed and decreased carbohydrate absorption
from the gut and does not result from the effects of metabolites
produced by fermentation of b-glucan in the colon. It is also
likely that b-glucan not only decreases the postprandial glucose
response due to high viscosity in the gastrointestinal tract but
also decreases starch digestion by a-amylase [38]. Processing and
cooking have been shown to signiﬁcantly alter these properties
and the resultant functional beneﬁts of b-glucan [39–42].

The molecular weight of b-glucan can also inﬂuence its
digestion and physiological properties [42]. The presence of
longer-chain b-glucans in the BB (from 650 000 to 700 000 Da
compared with GG 150 000 Da) may have decreased the
digestibility of spaghetti, because the enzyme penetration rate
was lower. Wood [27] found that adding 4% high-molecular-
weight barley b-glucan signiﬁcantly decreased the in vivo GR
of chapatis. Addition of high-molecular-weight barley b-glucan
did not change the GI of bread in hypercholesterolemic subjects
[41], whereas signiﬁcant GI decreases were observed in bread
with 6% and 12% b-glucan [18,43]. A previous study showed that
the addition of 0, 2, 4, and 8 g of barley b-glucan in a 75-g glucose
drink decreased postprandial glucose and insulin levels in
a dose-dependent manner [44]. Vitaglione et al. [45] observed
that using 3% of b-glucan from GG signiﬁcantly decreased (9%
less) the GR of bread. Moreover, they found a signiﬁcant decrease
in hunger and an increase in fullness and satiety.

Some investigators have reported that the limitation of water
availability as a consequence of soluble non-starch poly-
saccharide hydration could restrict gelatinization of starch
and, hence, decrease hydrolysis by a-amylase [46,47]. Other
researchers have proposed that a change in the microstructure of
cereal products in the presence of soluble ﬁber is responsible for
decreasing its digestibility [48,49]. Cleary and Brennan [15]
found that the restriction of starch gelatinization and slight

structural modiﬁcations to the b-glucan pasta matrix appear to
be responsible for the lower rates of sugar release during in vitro
digestion. BB concentrate with a higher-molecular-weight
b-glucan may absorb more water than the GG concentrate,
thus limiting water availability for starch gelatinization. More-
over, BB produces a different microstructure in pasta than the GG
concentrate. Further studies are required to investigate differ-
ences in microstructure and starch gelatinization in spaghetti
containing GG and BB.

Capillary blood samples were obtained by ﬁngerprick. Fin-
gerprick capillary blood responds more rapidly to changes in
blood glucose than other sites. When glucose concentrations are
increasing rapidly after a meal, ﬁngertip capillary glucose
concentrations are higher than capillary blood obtained from the
forearm, thigh, or abdomen [50–52]. Likewise, when glucose
concentrations are decreasing, ﬁngerprick capillary glucose
concentrations are also lower [32]. One limitation of this study is
the small number of subjects. Although the FAO/WHO [2]
recommends that a sample of six subjects is adequate, Brouns
et al. [30] advocated 10 subjects for better power and precision.
In addition, this study included only healthy, non-diabetic, and
non-obese subjects. Inferences therefore cannot be made about
the effect of b-glucan from GG and BB on the blood glucose
response in obese and hyperglycemic individuals.

Conclusion

the b-glucan concentrate.

The ﬁndings for BB agree with the study hypothesis that
a dose-dependent decrease in the GR and GI occurs with
In
increasing concentrations of
contrast, the addition of GG to spaghetti at concentrations of up
to 10% did not signiﬁcantly alter its GI. The addition of BB at
a concentration of 10% seemed to be an effective method of
increasing the ﬁber content of spaghetti and further decreasing
its GI. Further work is necessary to elucidate reasons for the
observed differences in the GR to GG and BB. Because the present
study incorporated b-glucan into fresh pasta, this work should
also be extended to determine the feasibility of incorporating BB
into commercially produced dry spaghetti.

Objective:  Consumption  of  sugar-sweetened  beverages  (SSBs),  which  include  soft  drinks,  fruit 
drinks,  iced  tea,  energy  and  vitamin  water  drinks  has  risen  across  the  globe.  Regular 
consumption of SSBs has been  associated with weight  gain and risk of overweight  and obesity 
but  its  role  in  the  development  of  related  chronic  metabolic  diseases,  such  as  metabolic 
syndrome (MetSyn) and type 2 diabetes (T2DM), has not been quantitatively reviewed. 
 
Methods: We searched the MEDLINE database up to May 2010 for prospective cohort studies of 
SSB  intake  and  risk  of  MetSyn,  and  T2DM.  We  identified  11  studies  (3  for  MetSyn;  8  for 
T2DM) for inclusion in a random effects meta-analysis comparing SSB intake in the highest to 
lowest quantiles in relation to risk of MetSyn and T2DM.  
 
Results:  Based  on  data  from  these  studies,  including  310,819  participants  and  15,043  cases  of 
T2DM,  individuals  in  the  highest  quantile  of  SSB  intake  (most  often  1-2  servings/day)  had  a 
26%  greater  risk  of  developing    T2DM  than  those  in the  lowest  quantile  (none  or  <  1  serving/ 
month)  (RR:1.26  (95%  CI:  1.12,  1.41)).  Among  studies  evaluating  MetSyn,  including  19,431 
participants and 5,803 cases, the pooled RR was 1.20 (95% CI: 1.02, 1.42).  
 
Conclusions:  In  addition  to  weight  gain,  higher  consumption  of  SSBs  is  associated  with 
development of MetSyn, and T2DM. These data provide empirical evidence that intake of SSBs 
should be limited to reduce obesity-related risk of chronic metabolic diseases.  
 
 

I 

n  recent  decades,  consumption  of 
sugar sweetened beverages (SSBs), 
which  includes  the  full  spectrum 
of  soft  drinks  (soda),  fruit  drinks,  and  energy 
and  vitamin  water  drinks  has  been  steadily 
increasing to varying degrees across the globe. 
For  example,  in  the  US  between  the  late 
1970’s  and  2006  the  per  capita  consumption 
of  SSBs  increased  from  64.4  kcal/d  to  141.7 
kcal.d,  representing  more 
than  a  2-fold 
increase(1).  Similar  temporal  patterns  have 
been  shown  for  Mexico  where  currently  over 
12  %  of  total  energy  intake  is  contributed  by 
these  beverages(2).  Of  particular  concern  is 
the  rapid  trajectory  of  increase  evident  in 
many  developing  countries  where  access  to 
SSBs  has  grown  concomitantly  with  rising 
rates of urbanization. Sales figures from Coca 
Cola’s  2007  annual  report  show  that  during 
2007,  India,  and  China  experienced  growths 
of  14%  and  18%  respectively,  in  the  volume 
of  beverages  sold,  indicative  of  substantial 
increases in sales at the population level(3).   

SSBs,  which  are  now  the  primary 
source  of  added  sugars  in  the  US  diet,  are 
comprised  of  energy-containing  sweeteners 
such  as  sucrose,  high  fructose  corn  syrup  or 
fruit-juice  concentrates,  all  of  which  have 
essentially  similar  metabolic  effects(4)  .  In 
contrast,  a  beverage  that  is  100%  fruit  juice 
and not blended with added sweeteners is not 
considered  a  SSB.  Increasingly,  groups  of 
scholars  and  organizations  such  as 
the 
American  Heart  Association  are  calling  for 
major  reductions  in  consumption  of  SSB’s(5, 
6).  Findings  from  well  powered  prospective 
epidemiologic  studies  have  shown  consistent 
positive associations between SSB intake and 
weight  gain  and  obesity  in  both  children  and 
adults(7).  Emerging  evidence  also  suggests 
that  habitual  SSB  consumption  is  associated 
with increased risk of MetSyn and T2DM(8). 
SSBs  are  thought  to  lead  to  weight-gain  by 
virtue  of 
their  high  sugar  content  and 
incomplete  compensation  for  total  energy  at 
subsequent  meals  following  intake  of  liquid

calories(7). Due to the high content of rapidly 
absorbable  carbohydrates  such  as  sucrose 
(50  %  glucose  and  50%  fructose)  and  high- 
fructose  corn  syrup  (HFCS)  (most  often  45% 
glucose  and  55%  fructose),  in  conjunction 
with the large volumes consumed, SSB’s may 
increase risk of Met Syn and T2DM not only 
through obesity but also by increasing dietary 
insulin 
glycemic 
resistance, 
and 
inflammation(9). Additional metabolic effects 
of 
to 
hypertension,  promote 
accumulation  of 
visceral  adipose  tissue  and  of  ectopic  fat  due 
to  elevated  hepatic  de  novo  lipogenesis(10) 
leading  to  the  development  of  the  high 
triglycerides,  low  HDL-cholesterol  and  small 
dense  LDL,  although  the  specific  metabolic 
effects of fructose versus glucose remain to be 
further examined. To summarize the available 
literature,  we  conducted  a  meta-analysis  of 
prospective  cohort  studies  to  examine  the 
relationship  between  SSB  consumption  and 
risk of developing MetSyn and T2DM.  
 
METHODS  
Literature  Search.  Relevant  English-
language articles were identified by searching 
the  Medline  database  (National  Library  of 
Medicine,  Bethesda,  MD)  from  1966  to  May 
2010  for  prospective  cohort  studies  of  intake 
of  sugar-  sweetened  beverages  (SSBs)  (soft 
drinks,  carbonated  soft  drinks,  fruitades,  fruit 
drinks,  sports  drinks,  energy  and  vitamin 
water  drinks,  sweetened  iced  tea,  punch, 
cordial,  squashes,  and  lemonade)  and  risk  of 
metabolic  syndrome  and  type  2  diabetes  in 
adults.    Key  words  such  as  “soda,”  “soda-
pop,” 
beverage” 
combined  with    “diabetes”,  “type  2  diabetes” 
and  “metabolic syndrome,”  were used in the 
primary  search  strategy,  as  well  as  in  a 
subsequent  Medical  subheading 
(MESH) 
terms  search.  Due  to  the  high  potential  for 
intractable confounding and reverse causation, 
cross-sectional studies were excluded. We did 

“sugar-sweetened 

and 

for 

retained 

term  patterns,  but 

not  consider  short-term  experimental  studies 
because  they  are  not  well-suited  to  capture 
long 
rather  provide 
important  insight  into  potential  underlying 
biologic  mechanisms.  Our  literature  search 
identified  15  studies  with  MetSyn  as  an 
endpoint  and  136  studies  with  T2DM  as  an 
endpoint. An additional study of T2DM by de 
Koning  and  colleagues  was  identified  via 
personal communication.   
Inclusion  Criteria  and  Data  Extraction. 
The  criteria  for  inclusion  of  studies  in  our 
meta-analysis  included:  prospective  cohort 
design,  endpoints  of  MetSyn  or  T2DM, 
presentation of an RR and associated measure 
of  variance  (SE,  or  95%  CI),  definition  and 
metric  for  SSB  intake  and  description  of 
adjustment  for  potential  confounders.  After 
applying  these  criteria,  3  studies  of  MetSyn  
(11-13)  and  8  studies  of  T2DM  (11,  14-19) 
were 
our  meta-analysis. 
Coefficients  and  SE  were  obtained  from 
Nettleton et al.(11) and Bazzano et al.(18), via 
correspondence.  Data 
extraction  was 
independently  performed  by  VSM  and  FBH, 
and  there  were  no  differences  in  extracted 
information, 
estimates 
comparing  extreme  quantiles  of  intake,  most 
often comparing none or < 1 serv/mo to ≥ 1 or 
2 
include 
Odegaard et al. where the highest category of 
intake was 2- ≥ 3  eight-oz servings per week 
(19),  Montonen  et  al.  where  the  comparison 
between  median  intakes  of  the  1st  and  4th 
quartiles  was  0  vs.  143  g/d  (note:  one  12-oz 
serv  =  336  g)(14)  and  Paynter  et  al.  where 
<one,  8-oz 
reference 
category(15).  Unless  otherwise  specified  a 
standard serving size of 12-oz was the metric 
used.  
Analysis.  A  total  of  8  studies  with  9  data 
points  were  included  in  our  meta-analysis  of 
T2DM  (11,  14-19)  and  3  studies  were 
included  in  our  meta-analysis  of  MetSyn(11-
13).  STATA  version  9.0  (StataCorp,  College 
Station,  TX)    was  used  to  obtain  summary

RR’s  using  both  random  and  fixed  effects 
models  calculated  from  the  logarithm  of  the 
RR’s  and  corresponding  95%  CI’s  of  the 
individual studies. We primarily used  random 
-effects  models  since  they  incorporate  both  a 
within-study  and  an  additive  between-studies 
component  of  variance  and  is  the  accepted 
method  to  use  in  the  presence  of  between  –
study 
generally 
considered the more conservative method(20). 
Significance  of  heterogeneity  of  study  results 
was  evaluated  using  the  Cochrane  Q  test, 
which  has  somewhat  limited  sensitivity,  and 
further by the I2 statistic, which represents the 
percentage  of  total  variation  across  studies 
that is due to between-study heterogeneity(21). 
Because  adjustment  for  total  energy  intake 
and duration of follow-up could be important 
sources  of  heterogeneity,  we  conducted 
independent 
using 
adjustment  for  energy  and  study  duration  as 
predictors  of  effect.  Since  the  association 
between  SSB 
these 
outcomes  is  likely  to  be  mediated  in  part  by 
an  increase  in  overall  energy  intake,  or 
adiposity,  adjusting  for 
is 
expected 
the  effect.  Where 
possible  we  used  estimates  that  were  not 
adjusted  for  energy  intake  or  adiposity  and 
conducted  sensitivity  analysis  by  removing 
studies,  which  only  provided  energy  or 
adiposity-  adjusted  estimates.  Potential  for 
publication  bias  was  evaluated  using  Begg 
and  Egger  tests  and  visual  inspection  of  the 
Begg funnel plot (22, 23).

Characteristics  of 

the  prospective 
cohort  studies  included  in  our  meta-analyses 
are  shown  in  table  1.  Three  studies  evaluated 
risk  of  MetSyn  (11-13)  and  8  studies  (9  data 
points)  evaluated  risk  of  T2DM  (11,  14-19). 
The  cohorts  included  men  and  women,  of 
predominately  white  or  black  populations 
from  the  USA,  adults  from  Finland  and 
Chinese adults from Singapore, with duration 

including 

of  follow-up  ranging  from  4  to  20  y  and 
number  of  participants  ranging  from  over 
3000  to  over  91,000.  The  majority  of  studies 
used  FFQ’s  to  evaluate  dietary  intake  and  6 
studies  (7  data  points)  (13,  15-17,  19) 
provided  effect  estimates 
that  were  not 
adjusted  for  total  energy  or  measures  of 
adiposity.  Based  on  data  from  these  studies, 
including  310,819  participants  and  15,043 
cases  of  T2DM,  the  pooled  RR  for  T2DM 
was RR:1.26 (95% CI: 1.12, 1.41) comparing 
extreme  quantiles  of  SSB  intake,  illustrating 
an  excess  risk  of  26%  associated  with  higher 
consumption  of  SSB  compared  to  lower 
consumption  (figure  1a).    Among  3  studies 
evaluating  MetSyn 
19,431 
participants  and  5,803  cases,  the  pooled  RR 
was  1.20  (1.02,  1.42)  (figure  1b).    Pooled 
estimates  from  the  fixed  effects  model  were 
RR:  1.25  (95%  CI  1.17,  1.32)  and  RR:  1.17 
(95%  CI  1.09,  1.26)  for  T2DM  and  MetSyn 
respectively.  
    Although  all  studies  except  one(11) 
showed  positive  associations, 
there  was 
significant  heterogeneity  between  studies  in 
both  analyses  (For  T2DM:  I2  66  %  95%  CI: 
31%,  83%;  p-value,  test  for  homogeneity 
0.003 and for MetSyn: I2 76 % 95% CI: 22%, 
93%; p-value, test for homogeneity 0.01 ).  In 
general larger studies with longer durations of 
follow-up 
stronger 
associations.  Among 
evaluating 
T2DM,  the  one  by  Nettleton(11)  is  both  the 
shortest  and  among  the  smallest  and  the  only 
one to show an inverse though non-significant 
association(11)  .  Removal  of  this  study  from 
our  analysis  only 
reduced  heterogeneity 
slightly (I2 62% 95% CI: 17%, 82%; p-value, 
test  for  homogeneity  0.01).  In  contrast, 
studies  by  Schulze  and  Palmer,  which  are 
longer  and  larger,  show  clearly  significant 
positive  associations(16,  17).  Despite  this, 
results  from  a  meta-regression  did  not  find 
duration of study to be a significant predictor 
of effect (p= 0.84). The study by Montonen et 
al,  which  shows  a  borderline  significant

positive association, has the fewest number of 
participants  and  considerably  lower  levels  of 
intake relative to other studies (median intake 
of SSB is 143 g/d in highest quartile of intake, 
where  one  12  oz  serv  is  336  g,).  Removal  of 
this  study  from  our  analysis  did  not  reduce 
heterogeneity,  which  is  to  be  expected  given 
its  small  percentage  weight  (p-value,  test  for 
study  by 
homogeneity  0.002)(14).  The 
Schulze  which 
largest,  and  used 
repeated measures of SSB intake, reported the 
strongest 
(16). 
Removal  of  this  study  from  the  pooled 
analysis  reduced  heterogeneity  to  borderline 
significance  (I2  51%  95%  CI:  0%,  78%;  p-
value,  test  for  homogeneity  0.05).    Tests  for 
publication  bias  generally 
the 
assumption that small studies (large variance) 
may  be  more  prone  to  publication  bias, 
compared to larger studies.  Visual inspection 
of  Begg’s  funnel  plot  (Supplemental  Figure 
1a, 
at 
http://care.diabetesjournals.org),  whereby  the 
S.E.  of  log  RR  (measure  of  study  size)  from 
each  study  was  plotted  against  the  log  RR 
(treatment  effect),  showed  symmetry  about 
the  plot,  suggesting  that  publication  bias  is 
unlikely, although values for MetSyn may not 
be  particularly  informative  due  to  the  small 
number  of  studies  included  in  the  analysis. 
Studies  with  a  large  SE  and  large  effect  may 
suggest  presence  of  a  small-study  effect  (the 
tendency  for  smaller  studies  in  a  meta-
analysis  to  show  larger  treatment  effects). 
Results  from  the  Begg  (T2DM  p-value  0.75; 
MetSyn  p-value  1.0)  and  Egger  (T2DM  p-
value  0.75;  MetSyn  p-value  0.72)  tests  also 
suggest that publication bias is unlikely.   
the  association  between  SSB 
 
consumption  and 
these  disease 
outcomes is mediated in part by energy intake 
and  adiposity,  adjusting  for  these  factors  will 
tend to underestimate any effect. Results from 
our  sensitivity  analysis  where  energy  and 
adiposity  adjusted  coefficients  were  excluded 
(11, 14, 18) showed a slight increase in risk of

risk  of 

Since 

T2DM  with  a  pooled  RR  of  1.28  (95%  CI: 
1.13,  1.45).  However  results  from  a  meta-
regression  did  not  find  adjustment  for  energy 
to be a significant predictor of effect (p=0.38).  
Sensitivity  analysis  was  not  possible  for 
studies of MetSyn because they are too few in 
number,  however  both  studies  that  adjusted 
for  these  potential  mediators  of  effect  had 
marginal  non-significant  associations(11,  12) 
while  the  study  that  reported  unadjusted 
estimates  has  showed  a  strong  positive 
association(13).      
DISCUSSION 

  

in 

Findings from our meta-analyses show 
a  clear  link  between  SSB  consumption  and 
risk  of  MetSyn  and  T2DM.  Based  on 
coefficients from 3 prospective cohort studies 
including 19,431 participants and 5,803 cases 
of  MetSyn,  participants 
the  highest 
category  of  intake  had  a  20%  greater  risk  of 
developing  MetSyn  than  those  in  the  lowest 
category  of  intake.  For  T2DM,  based  in  data 
from  8  prospective  cohort  studies  (9  data 
points),  including  310,819  participants  and 
15,043  cases  of  T2DM,  participants  in  the 
highest  category  of  SSB  intake  had  a  26% 
greater risk of developing T2DM compared to 
participants in the lowest category of intake.  

it 

that 

is  possible 

Since  we  compared  extreme  quantiles 
of  SSB  intake,  most  often  none  or  <  1 
serv/mo  with    ≥  1  or  2  serv/d,  categories  of 
intake between studies were not standardized. 
Therefore, 
random 
misclassification  somewhat  attenuated 
the 
pooled estimate. For those studies that did not 
define  serving  size,  a  standard  serving  of  12 
oz  was  assumed  which  may  over  or 
underestimate empirical SSB intake levels but 
should  not  materially  affect  our  results. 
Indeed  there  is  substantial  variation  in  study 
design  and  exposure  assessment,  across 
studies,  which  may  explain  the  large  degree 
of  between-study  heterogeneity  we  observed. 
Meta-analyses  are  inherently  less  robust  than 
individual  prospective  cohort  studies,  but  are 
useful  in  providing  an  overall  effect  size,

while  giving  larger  studies  and  studies  with 
less  random  variation  greater  weight  than 
smaller  studies.    Publication  bias  is  always  a 
potential  concern 
in  meta-analyses  but 
standard  tests  and  visual  inspection  of  funnel 
plots  suggested  no  evidence  of  publication 
bias 
in  our  analysis.  Ascertainment  of 
unpublished  results  may  have  reduced  the 
likelihood  of  publication  bias.    Because  our 
analysis  compared  only  the  top  with  the 
bottom  categories  due 
in 
creating  standard  units  across  studies,  we  did 
not use data from the intermediate categories. 
Thus,  the  comparison  of  extreme  categories 
was  not  statistically  significant 
the 
Montonen(14),  Paynter 
(women)(15)  and 
Bazzano(18)  studies,  even  though  the  overall 
tests for trend in these studies were significant. 
Although  our  summary  result  was  robustly 
positive,  the  overall  results  would  likely  by 
even  more  significant  if  we  had  been  able  to 
use all the data.  

to  difficulties 

for 

 All  studies  included  in  our  meta-
analysis,  considered  adjustment  for  potential 
confounding  by  various  diet  and  lifestyle 
factors,  and  for  most,  a  positive  association 
persisted, suggesting an independent effect of 
SSBs.  However,  residual  confounding  by 
unmeasured  or  imperfectly  measured  factors 
cannot  be  ruled  out.  Higher  levels  of  SSB 
intake  could  be  a  marker  of  an  overall 
unhealthy  diet  as  it  tends  to  cluster  with 
factors such as higher intakes of saturated and 
trans  fat  and  lower  intake  of  fiber(12)., 
Therefore  incomplete  adjustment  for  various 
diet  and  lifestyle  factors  could  overestimate 
the  strength  of 
the  positive  association 
between  SSB  intake  and  risk  of  MetSyn  and 
T2DM.  However, consistency of results from 
different  cohorts  reduces  the  likelihood  that 
residual  confounding  is  responsible  for  the 
findings.  Longitudinal  studies  evaluating  diet 
and chronic disease risk may also be prone to 
reverse  causation  i.e.  persons  change  their 
diet  because  of  symptoms  of  subclinical 
disease  or  related  weight-gain,  which  could 

result  in  spurious  associations(24).  While  not 
possible to completely eliminate, studies with 
longer  durations  of  follow-up  and  repeated 
measures  of  dietary  intake,  tend  to  be  less 
prone to this process.  

In 

several 

is  highly  accurate  according 

studies,  T2DM  was 
assessed by self-  report,  however, it has been 
shown in validation studies that self report of 
T2DM 
to 
medical  record  review  (25).  The  majority  of 
studies  used  validated  FFQs  to  measure  SSB 
intake,  which  is  the  most  robust  method  for 
estimating  an  individual’s  average  dietary 
intake compared to other assessment methods 
such  as  24-hour  diet  recalls(26).  However, 
measurement  error  in  dietary  assessment  is 
inevitable, but since the studies we considered 
are prospective in design, misclassification of 
SSB  intake  does  not  likely  differ  by  case 
status.  Such  nondifferential  misclassification 
of exposure is likely to underestimate the true 
association  between  SSB  intake  and  risk  of 
these outcomes.  

SSB’s  are  thought  to  lead  to  weight 
gain  by  virtue  of  their  high  added  sugar 
content,  low  satiety  potential  and  incomplete 
compensatory  reduction  in  energy  intake  at 
subsequent  meals  following  consumption  of 
liquid  calories  leading  to  positive  energy 
balance(7,  8).    While  SSB’s  increase  risk  of 
MetSyn  and  T2DM  in  part  due  to  their 
contribution  to  weight  gain,  an  independent 
effect  may  also  stem  from  the  high  levels  of 
rapidly  absorbable  carbohydrates  in  the  form 
of  added  sugars,  which  are  used  to  flavor 
these  beverages.  The  findings  by  Schulze  et 
al.,(16)  suggested  that  approximately  half  of 
SSB’s  effects  on  T2DM  was  mediated 
through obesity. In a recent study among over 
88,000  women  followed  for  24  years,  those 
who  consumed  ≥  2  SSBs  per  day  had  a  35% 
risk  of  coronary  heart  disease

potential  mediating  factors  including  BMI, 
total  energy  and  incident  T2DM  attenuated 
the associations but they remained statistically 
significant, suggesting that the effect of SSBs 
is not entirely mediated by these factors.  

Because  SSBs  have  been  shown  to 
raise blood glucose and insulin concentrations 
rapidly  and  dramatically  (28),  and  are  often 
consumed in large amounts, they contribute to 
a high dietary  glycemic  load (GL).  High GL 
diets are known to induce glucose intolerance 
and  insulin  resistance  particularly  among 
overweight  individuals(9)  and  can  increase 
levels of inflammatory biomarkers such as C-
reactive  protein,  linked  to  T2DM  risk(29).  
Findings from our cohorts indicate that a high 
dietary  GL  also  increases  risk  of  developing 
cholesterol  gallstone  disease,  which 
is 
associated  with  insulin  resistance,  Met  Syn 
and  T2DM(30).  Endogenous  compounds  in 
SSBs  such  as  advanced  glycation  end 
products,  produced  during  the  process  of 
caramelization  in  cola  type  beverages  may 
also  affect  pathophysiological  pathways 
related to T2DM and MetSyn (31). SSBs may 
also  increase  risk  indirectly  by  inducing 
alterations 
taste  preferences  and  diet 
quality  resulting  from  habitual  consumption 
of  highly  sweetened  beverages,  which  has 
also  been  noted  for  artificially  sweetened 
beverages(5). 
Short 

studies 
suggest that fructose, which is a constituent of 
both  sucrose  and  HFCS  in  relatively  equal 
parts,  may 
adverse 
metabolic  effects  compared 
to  glucose. 
Fructose is preferentially metabolized to lipid 
in  the  liver,  leading  to  increased  hepatic  de 
novo lipogenesis, the development of the high 
triglyceride  –  low  HDL-cholesterol  –  small, 
dense  LDL  atherogenic  dyslipidemia  and 
insulin  resistance  (32).  Recent  evidence  has 
also  shown  that  fructose  consumption  may 
promote accumulation of visceral adiposity or 
ectopic  fat  deposition  (10),  two  key  features 
of  a  dysmetabolic  state  increasing  risk  of

to 

T2DM and CVD(33), despite no difference in 
weight  gain  between  glucose  and  fructose 
conditions(10). In contrast, some studies have 
shown  greater  satiety  and  lower  total  energy 
intake following intake of fructose containing 
beverages compared to glucose beverages(34). 
Ghanim  and  colleagues  found  evidence  of 
oxidative  and  inflammatory  stress  following 
intake  of  glucose  but  not  fructose  or  orange 
juice(35).  However,  fructose  has  also  been 
shown 
increase  blood  pressure  when 
administered  acutely,  or  when  consumed  as 
SSBs,  an  effect  not  observed  with  glucose 
administration  or  consumption  of  aspartame- 
sweetened  beverages  (36,  37)  .  A  number  of 
prospective cohort studies have found positive 
associations  between  SSB  consumption  and 
incident hypertension(11, 13). Fructose is also 
the only sugar able to increase blood uric acid 
concentrations  and  SSB  consumption  has 
been  linked to development of hyperuricemia 
(serum  uric  acid  level>7  mg/dl  for  men  and 
>5.7  mg/dl  for  women)(38)  and  gout(39). 
Men who consumed ≥ 2 SSBs per day had an 
85%  greater 
risk  of  developing  gout 
compared to infrequent consumers (RR=1.85, 
95%  CI:  1.08,  3.16;  p<0.001  for  trend).  No 
association  was  shown  with  diet  soda.  A 
recent randomized controlled trial among men 
in  Spain  showed  that  high  doses  of  fructose 
increased blood pressure and induced features

 In  conclusion,  this  meta-analysis  has 
demonstrated  that  higher  consumption  of

provides further support to limit consumption

The interaction between oat b-glucan and other food components has the potential to inﬂuence starch
digestibility and consequently affect its bioactivity in reducing glycemic responses. Blood glucose con-
centrations were measured before and after ingesting wheat and oat granolas, with 0.6 and 6.2 g of b-glu-
can, respectively, and two starch doses (40 and 60 g). As the in vitro extract viscosity of b-glucan
increased, the in vitro starch digestibility was reduced and the glucose responses were lowered. The peak
blood glucose response (PBGR) and the incremental area under the curve (iAUC) were lower in the 40 g
than in the 60 g starch formulation. b-Glucan was signiﬁcantly more active in reducing PBGR and iAUC
when the b-glucan/starch ratio was 1.6:10 rather than 1.1:10. This information is valuable for new prod-
uct development and for quality assessment of bioactive foods containing oat b-glucan.

1. Introduction

Several studies have shown that (1 ? 3)(1 ? 4)-b-D-glucan is
effective in reducing post-prandial glucose and insulin responses
(Braaten et al., 1991; Cavallero, Empilli, Brighenti, & Stanca,
2002; Granfeldt, Liljeberg, Drews, Newman, & Bjorck, 1994;
Hallfrisch & Behall, 2000; Makelainen et al., 2007; Panahi, Ezata-
gha, Temelli, Vasanthan, & Vuksan, 2007). This soluble ﬁbre is a
major component of oat and barley ﬁbre. Its physiological activity
has been attributed to its effect in increasing viscosity in the upper
digestive tract (Dikeman & Fahey, 2006; Wood et al., 1994) but the
mechanism of action is still not well understood.

It has been suggested that the increase in luminal viscosity im-
pairs the rate of digestion of starch and absorption of glucose due
to a reduction of pancreative amylase activity and movement of re-
leased sugars to the gut wall (Dunaif & Schneeman, 1981). This
mechanism could be important in the physiological functionality
of b-glucan in vivo, however, other physical mechanisms may also
be involved, particularly when the non-starch polysaccharides are
part of a food matrix (Brennan, Blake, Ellis, & Schoﬁeld, 1996).

The rate and extent of starch digestion is a major determinant in
the rate of blood glucose rise. The starch digestion rate is inﬂu-
enced by botanical origin as this determines the amylose:amylo-
pectin ratio and the structural
the starch granule
(Gallant, Bouchet, Buleon, & Perez, 1992). The other important fac-
tor is thermal processing, which determines the extent of starch
gelatinisation, particle size and the integrity of the plant cell wall
(Heaton, Marcus, Emmett, & Bolton, 1988).

type of

The relationship between the rate of digestion and absorption of
carbohydrate foods and the glycemic response has been shown in
various in vitro digestion methods that mimic the in vivo situation
(Englyst, Veenstra, & Geoffrey, 1996; Englyst, Vinoy, Englyst, &
Lang, 2003; Goñi, Garcia-Alonso, & Saura-Calixto, 1997; Granfeldt
et al., 1994). Englyst et al. (2003) found a very high correlation be-
tween the rate of in vitro glucose released from starchy foods and
the glycemic index (GI) reported in tables. Rapidly available glu-
cose (RAG) was positively (r2 = 0.54, P < 0.001) and slowly available
glucose (SAG) was negatively (r2 = 0.63, P < 0.001) correlated with

the GI of 23 products (ﬁve breakfast cereals, six bakery products
and crackers, and 12 biscuits).

Soluble ﬁbres may reduce starch digestibility by changing the
microstructure of food products (Brennan et al., 1996; Cleary &
Brennan, 2006; Tudorica, Kuri, & Brennan, 2002) or by limiting
water availability as a consequence of soluble non-starch polysac-
charide hydration which, in turn, restricts starch gelatinisation
(Banchathanakij & Suphantharika, 2009; Cleary & Brennan, 2006).
A wide range of dietary ﬁbres (guar gum, cellulose, pectin, locust
bean gum, wheat bran, resistant starch, b-glucan, pea ﬁbre and inu-
lin) have been used in the production of pasta, biscuits and bread
(Brennan & Cleary, 2007; Brennan & Samyue, 2004; Brennan
et al., 1996; Symons & Brennan, 2004b; Tudorica et al., 2002). Sol-
uble ﬁbres appear to decrease the rate of starch degradation in vitro
to a larger extent than the insoluble dietary ﬁbres. However, the
starch digestibility was reduced to different degrees in food prod-
ucts with the same soluble ﬁbre source indicating that the ability
of the ﬁbre to reduce starch digestibility in foods may be process
and product dependent (Brennan, 2005). The solubility of the b-
glucan also depends on the cereal and tissue source, food formula-
tion, processing and storage conditions (Lan-Pidhainy, Brummer,
Tosh, Wolever, & Wood, 2007; Regand, Tosh, Wolever, & Wood,
2009).

b-Glucan depolymerisation has been observed in oat and bar-
ley foods. The physical state of the b-glucan in the raw material,
b-glucanase activity, processing, and storage conditions affect the
molecular weight (MW) of b-glucan (Aman, Rimsten, & Anders-
son, 2004; Beer, Wood, Weisz, & Fillion, 1997; Tosh et al.,
2010). However, little is known about the role of the MW of
b-glucan on the reduction of starch digestibility. If the attenuation
of reducing sugar release is a function of the increased digest
viscosity and reduced motility, then the MW and amount of
b-glucan solubilised in the gut should be critical in its capacity
to reduce it.

Therefore, the major objective of this study was to investigate
whether the physicochemical properties of b-glucan were related
to its capacity to retard starch digestibility and therefore reduce
glycemic responses. The secondary objective was to examine the
importance of the starch/b-glucan ratio in the efﬁcacy of b-glucan
by testing two different starch doses with the same content of b-
glucan.

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Materials

The ingredients used to prepare the test foods were: large ﬂake
rolled oats (Quaker Oats, ON, Canada, 4.3% b-glucan), OatWellÒ 22
oat bran (CreaNutrition, Switzerland, 22% b-glucan), white wheat
ﬂour (Five Roses, ON, Canada), rolled wheat ﬂakes (Grain Process
Enterprises LTD, ON, Canada), egg white powder (El Peto Pts, ON,
Canada), vegetable oil shortening (CriscoÒ, The J.M. Smucker
Company, ON, Canada), baking powder (Nabisco, ON, Canada)
and vanilla extract (McCormick, ON, Canada). SEBﬂo, a food-grade
b-glucanase enzyme was used to vary the MW of b-glucan
(Specialty Enzymes and Biochemicals Co., Chino, CA, USA).

Alpha-amylase (EC 3.2.1.1, from human saliva), pepsin (EC
3.4.23.1, from porcine stomach) and pancreatin (EC 232.468.9,
from porcine pancreas) used for the b-glucan in vitro digestion
were from Sigma–Aldrich (Oakville, ON, Canada). Pancreatin from
porcine pancreas (Sigma P7545, activity 8  USP/g) was purchased
from Sigma Chemical Company (St Louis, MO, USA), amyloglucosi-
dase (EC 3.2.1.3., 3300 U/ml) and glucose oxidase–peroxidase assay
kit were purchased from Megazyme International Ireland Ltd.
(Bray, Ireland).

2.2. Experimental foods

Product formulations, energy and nutrient composition for oat
and wheat control products are shown in Table 1. Oat products
were formulated to contain 6.2 g of b-glucan with two different
levels of total available carbohydrates (TAC): approximately 40
and 60 g. The amount of free sugars was kept to a minimum
(0.3 g per serving). The sources of b-glucan in the oat products
were oat bran and whole oat ﬂakes. Wheat control products with
similar TAC and minimal amounts of b-glucan (0.6 g/serving) were
made with whole wheat ﬂakes and white wheat ﬂour. Oat and
wheat control products were analysed for fat (AOAC 960.39), pro-
tein (AOAC 990.03), free sugars and total starch (AOAC 996.11). Dry
matter content was determined according to a standard method
(AACC method 44-15A, 2000). Dry egg white powder and vegetable
shortening were added in varying amounts to equalise fat and pro-
tein content. For each test food formulation, three different MW
distributions of b-glucan, designated as low (L), medium (M) and
high (H), were produced after incubating the dough for 30 min
with different concentrations of b-glucanase: for L and M, 2.5
and 16 ll per serving, respectively, and by no added enzyme in
the HMW product.

For the preparation of the products, the ingredients required for
18 servings (plus 5% to allow for wastage) were mixed using an
industrial mixer (Hobart, Corp., Troy, OH, USA) and the resulting
batter was kept at room temperature for 30 min to allow b-glucan
hydrolysis to occur. After this time, the batter was poured in a large
baking tray and baked at 350 °C in an oven (LC Bakery Equipment
Services LTD, Brantford, ON) for approximately 3 h until it reached
40% moisture content. After cooling, the food was cut into 5  5 cm
pieces and packaged in plastic bags in individual servings.
Throughout the clinical trial, the products were stored at 4 °C for
no more than 10 days. Microbiological analysis, performed by
MAXXAM Analytics (Mississauga, ON, Canada), demonstrated that,
under these storage conditions, the shelf life of the products was
more than 1 month.

2.3. Physicochemical analysis of b-glucan

b-Glucan was extracted from each batch of product using the
method described by Beer et al. (1997), except that the solids to
liquids ratio was 1:5. The method involves incubating a portion
of food in a shaking water bath with a series of digestive enzymes
(a-amylase at pH 6.9, pepsin at pH 2 and pancreatin at pH 6.8)
(Beer et al., 1997).

The b-glucan concentration in the supernatant from the in vitro
digestion extraction was measured by ﬂow-injection analysis (FIA,
Lab Instruments, Bellevue, WA) as described previously (Tosh et al.,
2010) and is referred to as soluble b-glucan. The total b-glucan con-
tent in the food products was determined by the AOAC ofﬁcial
method 995.16 using an assay kit (Megazyme International, Bray,
Ireland). The glucose concentration was measured spectrophoto-
metrically with a glucose oxidase–peroxidase assay kit (Megazyme
International, Bray, Ireland). The peak molecular weight (Mp) of b-
glucan was determined using high-performance size-exclusion
chromatography with post-column calcoﬂuor addition as de-
scribed by Tosh et al. (2010).

Viscosity was measured by a controlled strain rheometer (TA
Instrument, ARES, New Castle, DE) ﬁtted with a cone-and-plate
geometry (angle 0.04 radians, diameter 50 mm). Apparent viscos-
ity was measured in a shear rate range of 400–0.1 s 1. For statisti-
cal analysis, viscosities measured at the shear rate 30 s 1 were
used primarily for consistency with earlier publications.

2.4. In vitro starch digestibility

In vitro starch digestibility was determined using the method
described by Englyst, Kingman, and Cummings (1992) with modi-
ﬁcations. Porcine pancreatin (0.45 g) was dispersed in water (4 ml)
and centrifuged at 1500g for 10 min. The supernatant (2.7 ml) was
transferred to a beaker, and 0.3 ml of diluted amyloglucosidase
(0.32 ml of amyloglucosidase diluted to 0.4 ml with distilled
water) and 0.2 ml distilled water were added to the solution. This
enzyme solution was freshly prepared for each digestion.

Oat and wheat control food products were milled to pass
through a 2.82 mm pore diameter sieve (number 7) and the frac-
tion retained by a 1.68 mm pore diameter sieve (number 12) was
used for the starch digestibility test. Food amounts containing
100 mg of total starch were weighed into glass tubes in triplicate
and 15 glass beads (4 mm diameter) were added to each tube.
Two millilitres of 0.05 M HCl and 10 mg of pepsin were added to
the tubes and incubated at 37 °C with continuous shaking
(200 strokes/min) for exactly 30 min. Then, 4 ml of 0.5 M sodium
acetate buffer (pH 5.2) were added to each test tube and at
1 min intervals, the enzyme solution (1 ml) was added, replacing
the tubes in the shaking water bath. Aliquots (0.1 ml) were taken
at 20 and 120 min intervals and mixed with 1 ml of 50% ethanol.
These solutions were centrifuged (2000 rpm for 10 min) and the
hydrolysed glucose content of the supernatants was measured by
the glucose oxidase–peroxidase assay.

Starch classiﬁcations based on the rate of hydrolysis were: rap-
idly digestible starch (RDS; digested within 20 min), slowly digest-
ibly starch (SDS; digestible between 20 and 120 min) and resistant
starch (RS; undigested after 120 min). The amounts of these three
fractions were divided by the total amount of starch in the sample
and expressed as percent of total starch (%RDS, %SDS and %RS) or as
grams per serving (RDS, SDS and RS).

2.5. Clinical trial

Twelve healthy subjects were recruited (6 female, 6 male; aged
27.3 ± 1.6 years; BMI 25.6 ± 1.45 kg/m2, mean ± SEM). The study
was approved by the by the Human Subjects Review Committee

of the University of Toronto and informed written consent was ob-
tained from all volunteers prior to their participation.

The statistical design of the clinical trial was randomised with
repeated measures. Each subject was tested on the eight different
products. The wheat control products were tested twice by each
subject at the beginning and end of the study; the mean values
of the two tests for each subject were used for statistical analysis.
Subjects were allowed to choose to have, with the test meals, a
drink of one cup of water, coffee or tea with 30 ml 2% milk-fat milk
per cup if desired. The drink chosen remained constant for all se-
ven test meals.

Subjects were studied on ten separate days between 8:00 and
9:30 am after 10–14 h overnight fasts. There was at least a one-
day washout period between the tests. On each test occasion, a
fasting blood sample was obtained by ﬁnger-prick and the subject
started to consume a test meal. At the ﬁrst bite a timer was started
and additional blood samples taken at 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 90 and
120 min. During the 2 h of the test, subjects remain seated quietly.
Whole blood samples were placed into 5 ml tubes containing a
small amount of sodium ﬂuoride and potassium oxalate as an anti-
coagulant and preservative, stored at  20 °C, and analysed within
48 h using a glucose oxidase analyser (YSI model 2300 STAT, Yel-
low Springs, OH). Peak blood glucose responses (PBGR) and incre-
mental areas under
(iAUC),
subtracting area below fasting, were calculated using the method
described by Wolever, Jenkins, Jenkins, and Josse (1991).

the glucose response curves

2.6. Statistical analysis

Statistical analyses were performed using Graph Prism v. 5.0
(GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA). The physicochemical char-
acteristics of b-glucan (% solubility, extract viscosity and Mp) and
the RDS, SDS and RS (% w/w d.b.) from the in vitro starch digestibil-
ity test were compared by two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA)
examining for the effects of carbohydrate dose, b-glucan MW and
the dose  MW interaction. After demonstrating signiﬁcant heter-
ogeneity, the differences between individual means were assessed
using Bonferroni’s test with the criterion for signiﬁcance being 2-
tailed P < 0.05. PBGR and iAUC values were statistically analysed
in the same way.

One subject dropped out before completing the second wheat
control food containing 60 g carbohydrate. Thus, the control for
this subject had only one value; the other 11 subjects completed
duplicate tests of the control 60 g carbohydrate test meal, and all
12 subjects completed duplicate tests of the control 40 g carbohy-
drate test meal. All correlations in the ﬁgures were determined
using linear regression in Graph Prism. Two-tailed P < 0.05 was
considered to be statistically signiﬁcant.

3. Results

3.1. Physicochemical data

The three oat b-glucan MWs (L, M and H) that resulted from the
different levels of b-glucan depolymerisation were signiﬁcantly
different (P < 0.0001) from each other, with the lowest of them
resembling the Mp found in the control wheat product (Table 2).
The MW distributions are shown in Fig. 1. As the degree of depoly-
merisation increased the width of the distributions increased.
Although the native b-glucan in 40H and 60H were fairly symmet-
rical, shoulders developed in the partially depolymerised MW dis-
tributions. Signiﬁcant differences (P < 0.0001) were observed in the
viscosities of the b-glucan in vitro extracts, which, as expected, de-
creased with decreasing Mp in both formulations (Table 2).

3.2. In vitro starch digestibility

Oat products containing high MW b-glucan (40H and 60H) had
signiﬁcantly (P < 0.05) lower %RDS (% of total starch) and higher
%SDS than the corresponding wheat controls in both starch dose
formulations. The %SDS in the 40M, 60M and 60L were also signif-
icantly higher
than in their corresponding wheat controls
(P < 0.05) (Table 2).

lower

The statistical analysis between the %SDS values showed signif-
icant dose and interaction effects (P < 0.0001). Thus, %SDS was al-
ways
in the 60 g than the 40 g starch dose for
corresponding MW distributions, and also, the effect of the pres-
ence of b-glucan in increasing the %SDS was more pronounced
with the 60 g than the 40 g starch dose. In addition, the resistant
starch fractions were signiﬁcantly higher for the 60 g than the
40 g starch dose (P < 0.0001).

Signiﬁcant correlations (P < 0.05) were found between the
log(viscosity) of the b-glucan extract vs the %RDS or %SDS when
using the compiled data from both starch dose formulations
(Fig. 2A). As the viscosity increased,
the %RDS decreased
(r2 = 0.83, P < 0.002) and the %SDS increased (r2 = 0.66, P < 0.01).
Similar
relationships were found between the

from test foods.

Regarding b-glucan solubility, there were signiﬁcant dose
(P < 0.0001), MW (P < 0.0001) and interaction (P < 0.0001) effects.
The solubility increased with increasing Mp and was always high-
er in the 60 than in the 40 g starch formulation (Table 2). In order
to establish a relationship with the viscosity of the extract, the
solubility was also calculated as the concentration of b-glucan
in the ﬁnal in vitro digestion extract (mg/ml), referred to as ce
(data not shown). The viscosity of random coil polymers in solu-
tion depends on the concentration and molecular size making the
parameter Mp  ce a more fundamental indicator of the b-glucan

log(Mp  ce) and the %RDS (r2 = 0.55, P < 0.03) or %SDS (r2 = 0.53,
P < 0.04) (data not shown). When each starch dose was considered
separately and the log(viscosity) was plotted against SDS, parallel
lines were found, with the 60 g starch dose having a higher inter-
cept than the 40 g dose (Fig. 2B).

3.3. Post-prandial blood glucose response

The statistical analyses of iAUC and PBGR showed main effects
of carbohydrate dose, MW as well as interaction effects (P < 0.01)
(Table 2). Overall, iAUC and PBGR were signiﬁcantly higher in the
60 g than in the 40 g starch formulations (P < 0.01). Oat products
containing b-glucan with high Mp were signiﬁcantly (P < 0.05)
more effective in reducing the iAUC and PBGR in both the 40 g
and 60 g starch dose formulations and the medium Mp food in
the 40 g formulation (P < 0.05) (Table 2) than the other oat formu-
lations and the control products. Fig. 3 shows the changes in post-
prandial blood glucose over time.

Signiﬁcant correlations were found between iAUC and RDS (g/
serving) in the 40 g formulation (r2 = 0.98, P = 0.01) and in the
60 g formulation (r2 = 0.99, P = 0.01). The relationships between
iAUC and RAG in the 40 g formulation (r2 = 0.98, P = 0.01) and in
the 60 g formulation (r2 = 0.995, P = 0.002) were also signiﬁcant.

For the relationship between iAUC and SDS, the correlation was
signiﬁcant only in the 40 g formulation (r2 = 0.95, P = 0.03) and
not in the 60 g formulation (P > 0.05) (Fig. 4).

To compare the effect that the starch digestibility had on the
blood glucose response, the total amount in grams per serving
for each fraction was calculated for the 40 g and 60 g formulations,
as well as the RAG fraction that corresponds to the equivalent in
glucose units of the RDS fraction plus free glucose. When the iAUC
was compared with the starch digestibility fractions (in grams per
serving), iAUC increased with increasing RDS or RAG, or with
decreasing SDS. Positive correlations were also found between
PBGR and RDS in the 40 g starch formulation (r2 = 0.96, P < 0.02),
PBGR and RAG in the 40 g starch formulation (r2 = 0.97, P < 0.02)
and PBGR and RAG in the 60 g starch formulation (r2 = 0.91,
P < 0.05)
the log(viscosity)
(r2 = 0.66, P < 0.02) and the log(Mp  ce) (r2 = 0.51, P < 0.05) of the
b-glucan extracts from the results of the compiled data from both
formulations signiﬁcantly correlated to the PBGR. Higher correla-
tion coefﬁcients were obtained when the glycemic response data
were plotted against the log(viscosity) for each formulation, inde-
pendently. For the 40 g starch formulations (Fig. 2C and D) the
PBGR (r2 = 0.99, P < 0.004) and iAUC (r2 = 0.91, P = 0.04) were
greatly inﬂuenced by the viscosity of the soluble b-glucan.

(P > 0.05).

4. Discussion

In the current study, the Mp values for the 40H and 60H (Table 2)
were 17% and 22% smaller, respectively, than the Mp values in the
original sources of b-glucan used: oat bran (Mp = 2,537,000 ±
11,000 g/mol) and whole oat ﬂakes (Mp = 2,556,000 ± 33,000 g/
mol), which indicates that little depolymerisation occurred during
processing. An Mp value (1,911,000 ± 17,500) comparable to the
high MW b-glucan was previously found by Regand et al. (2009)
in oat granola with similar formulation and cooking method. The
addition of b-glucanase to the test food batter resulted, as ex-
pected, in smaller Mp values; the more enzyme added, the smaller
the Mp (Table 2).

b-Glucan is known as a soluble ﬁbre but usually only a portion
of the total is extracted under physiological conditions. Solubility is
a function of the MW (Tosh et al., 2008), but contrary to what
might be anticipated, the solubility of b-glucan was reduced as
the Mp was decreased, as shown in Table 2. The reduction in solu-
bility at Mp values lower than 410 kg/mol was previously observed
by Tosh et al. (2008) in oat bran mufﬁns treated with b-glucanase.
This behaviour has been attributed to the formation of insoluble
aggregates between the smaller, more mobile polymer molecules.
The lower solubility in the 40 g starch dose formulation, con-
taining a higher b-glucan:starch ratio (6.2:38 = 0.16) than the
60 g starch dose formulation (6.3:60 = 0.11), may be due to the
higher proportion of b-glucan in the solid phase that increased
the probability of interactions between the b-glucan chains. Even
though the b-glucan solubility in the 40 g starch dose formulation
was lower, the slightly higher MW in the 40H and 40M than 60H

and 60M, resulted in higher (Mp  ce) values and signiﬁcantly
higher extract viscosities (P < 0.05) (Table 2).

Table 2 shows the starch digestibility fractions of wheat and oat
products expressed as percent of total starch. The wheat products
used as controls in this research had an average RDS content of
72 ± 1%, the SDS was 22 ± 4% and the average RS in the wheat gran-
olas was 5.8 ± 2.6%. Thus, these oat and wheat products have starch
digestibility characteristics intermediate between white bread
(RDS – 90%, SDS – 9%, RS  1%), and spaghetti (RDS  52%,
SDS  42%, RS  6%) (Englyst et al., 1996).

The signiﬁcantly (P < 0.0001) higher values of RS and lower SDS
found in the 60 g starch compared to the 40 g starch formulations
(Table 2 and Fig. 2B) may be explained by differences in the com-
petition for water in the products. Oat b-glucan has a high water
binding capacity, so that it absorbs water more easily than starch
granules and retains it during baking. The formulations were made
up with equivalent % moisture and the 60 g starch formulations re-
quired longer baking times to reach the same ﬁnal moisture con-
tent. The MW and solubility of the b-glucan inﬂuenced the
digestibility of the starch. As observed in Fig. 2A, the addition of
b-glucan reduced the RDS fraction (P < 0.002) and increased the
SDS fraction (P < 0.01) as a function of its in vitro extract viscosity.
Other authors have reported a similar behaviour in the reduc-
tion of sugars released, with a different in vitro starch digestion
method, in pasta, biscuits and bread with added b-glucan (Brennan
& Samyue, 2004; Cleary & Brennan, 2006; Symons & Brennan,
2004b). However, none of them was able to ﬁnd a correlation be-
tween the ability to reduce the sugar release and the dose of b-glu-
can in the same or different food products. In neither of these

previous studies were the physico-chemical characteristics of b-
glucan (Mp, solubility and viscosity) measured and therefore the
relationships between the physical characteristics and bioactivity
could not be assessed.

An increase in the extract viscosity (or Mp  ce) of b-glucan coin-
cides with a reduction in the in vitro starch digestibility. This prop-
erty has been previously explained as a result of the rheological
and/or microstructural alterations to the food by b-glucan which
may reduce the ability of starch to gelatinise during cooking
(Symons & Brennan, 2004b). The observation of a reduction in
the gelatinisation enthalpy values measured by DSC (Brennan &
Cleary, 2007; Cleary & Brennan, 2006; Symons & Brennan, 2004a)
with the addition of b-glucan supported the suggested mecha-
nisms of action.

These results indicate that the viscosity of b-glucan plays a key
role in reducing starch digestibility, however, it still remains un-
clear as to whether this reduction is a consequence of altered rhe-
ological properties of starch dispersions resulting in a limitation of
water available for starch hydration because of b-glucan hydration,
or whether the formation of a highly concentrated b-glucan phase
inhibits enzyme accessibility to partially gelatinised starch gran-
ules (Symons & Brennan, 2004b). Such a reduction in starch avail-
able for degradation could be an additional concurrent mechanism
to the reduction in motility and sugar diffusion promoted by in-
crease in viscosity in systems using glucose alone, in which starch
digestion rate plays no role (Wood, Beer, & Butler, 2000).

Studying the activity of b-glucan in reducing starch digestibility
is a necessary and important step in developing an understanding
of the mechanisms of action of b-glucan and other ﬁbres in reduc-
ing glycemic responses in real food systems. Clearly, among the
possible mechanisms governing the glycemic response, the rate
of starch digestion would be expected to have an important role
(Bornet et al., 1989). The relationship between the rate of digestion
and absorption of carbohydrate foods and the glycemic response
has also been shown in various in vitro digestion methods that mi-
mic the in vivo situation (Englyst et al., 1996, 2003; Goñi et al.,
1997; Granfeldt et al., 1994). Englyst et al. (2003) found a very high
correlation between the rate of in vitro glucose released from star-
chy foods and the glycemic index (GI) reported in tables. RAG was
positively (r2 = 0.54, P < 0.001) and SAG (slowly available glucose)
was negatively (r2 = 0.63, P < 0.001) correlated with the GI of 23
products (ﬁve breakfast cereals, six bakery products and crackers,
and 12 biscuits).

In this respect, this study offers a valuable advance over most of
the previous research done on this subject where the glycemic val-
ues have been estimated and not measured (Brennan & Samyue,
2004; Cleary & Brennan, 2006; Symons & Brennan, 2004b). The
acquisition of real human glycemic responses allowed us the com-
parison of real PBGR and iAUC values with in vitro starch digestibil-
ity data and also permitted us to establish correlations of both of
these with the physicochemical properties of dietary ﬁbre.

As shown in Fig. 4, signiﬁcant correlations were found when the
RDS and RAG values from the compiled data from both formula-
tions were plotted against iAUC (r2 = 0.87 and P < 0.0007, for both).
Moreover, even higher correlation coefﬁcients (r2 > 0.98, P < 0.01,
for all) were found when separate data for each dose were plotted,
with parallel slopes and signiﬁcantly different intercepts. The SDS
fraction was not correlated to the iAUC when the two starch doses
were plotted together, but was signiﬁcant for the 40 g starch dose
alone (r2 = 0.95, P < 0.03). This indicates that either RAG or RDS
could be good indicators of the glycemic responses of this granola
product. However, for the SDS fraction there is an additional inﬂu-
ence of the starch-dose/formulation/processing in its relationship
with the glycemic response.

With regard to the relationship between the physicochemical
properties of b-glucan and the glycemic responses, signiﬁcantly

lower PBGR and iAUC values were observed after ingesting 40H,
60H and 40M oat products (Table 2). The reductions in PBGR and
iAUC as a function of b-glucan extract viscosity (or Mp  ce) have
been reported previously (Regand et al., 2009; Tosh et al., 2008).
Regand et al. (2009) reported a relationship of PBGR =  0.01(Mp 
ce  10 5) + 2.8 from a compiled data from mufﬁns, granola, por-
ridge and bread. In the current study, a low but signiﬁcant correla-
tion (r2 = 0.54, P = 0.04) was also found between these two
parameters with a very similar equation of: PBGR =  0.01(Mp 
ce  10 5) + 2.7 (data not shown).

The starch dose effect is not as evident in the PBGR (Fig. 2C),
but, for iAUC, separate equations can be found depending on the
amount of starch ingested, as expected, being only signiﬁcant for
the 40 g starch dose (r2 = 0.91, P = 0.04) (Fig. 2D). The higher activ-
ity of beta-glucan in reducing the PBGR and iAUC in the 40 g than
in the 60 g formulation was evidenced by signiﬁcant interaction ef-
fects (P < 0.01) of the values for the two formulations from Table 2.
Beta-glucan is more active when less starch is present.

5. Conclusions

The current study demonstrates that the inhibition of starch
digestibility by b-glucan is a function of its extractability and is
correlated with the b-glucan bioactivity in reducing glycemic
responses.

Signiﬁcant correlations (P < 0.01) have been established, such as
the fact that as the in vitro extract viscosity (or Mp  ce) of b-glucan
increases, the in vitro starch digestibility is reduced (RDS and RAG
decrease and SDS increases) and the PBGR and iAUC are lowered.
Moreover, when comparing the different starch dose formulations,
the glucose responses (PBGR and iAUC) were lower (P < 0.01) in the
40 g than in the 60 g. In addition, b-glucan was signiﬁcantly more
active (P < 0.01) in reducing PBGR and iAUC when the b-glucan/
starch ratio was 0.16 rather than 0.11.

One type of product, a baked product similar to granola, has
been analysed in this study. Additional studies are required to
determine the applicability of the correlations found here to other
types of food products and processing and cooking techniques. A
universal equation would be of great value for new product devel-
opment and for the quality assessment of bioactive foods contain-
ing oat b-glucan.
