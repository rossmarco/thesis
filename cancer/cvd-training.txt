Background—Previous studies on intake of linoleic acid (LA), the predominant n-6 fatty acid, and coronary heart disease 
(CHD)  risk  have  generated  inconsistent  results. We  performed  a  systematic  review  and  meta-analysis  of  prospective 
cohort studies to summarize the evidence regarding the relation of dietary LA intake and CHD risk.

Methods and Results—We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE databases through June 2013 for prospective cohort studies 
that reported the association between dietary LA and CHD events. In addition, we used unpublished data from cohort 
studies in a previous pooling project. We pooled the multivariate-adjusted relative risk (RR) to compare the highest with 
the lowest categories of LA intake using fixed-effect meta-analysis. We identified 13 published and unpublished cohort 
studies with a total of 310 602 individuals and 12 479 total CHD events, including 5882 CHD deaths. When the highest 
category was compared with the lowest category, dietary LA was associated with a 15% lower risk of CHD events (pooled 
RR, 0.85; 95% confidence intervals, 0.78–0.92; I2=35.5%) and a 21% lower risk of CHD deaths (pooled RR, 0.79; 95% 
confidence intervals, 0.71–0.89; I2=0.0%). A 5% of energy increment in LA intake replacing energy from saturated fat 
intake was associated with a 9% lower risk of CHD events (RR, 0.91; 95% confidence intervals, 0.87–0.96) and a 13% 
lower risk of CHD deaths (RR, 0.87; 95% confidence intervals, 0.82–0.94).

Conclusions—In prospective observational studies, dietary LA intake is inversely associated with CHD risk in a dose–
response manner. These data provide support for current recommendations to replace saturated fat with polyunsaturated 
fat for primary prevention of CHD.   (Circulation. 2014;130:1568-1578.)

The effects of dietary fat intake on primary prevention of 

coronary heart disease (CHD) have been a long standing 
interest.1 Greater intakes of trans-fat and saturated fat compared 
with polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are associated with 
increased risk of CHD.2 Therefore, substitution of PUFAs for 
saturated fatty acids (SFAs) has been recommended to reduce 
CHD risk.3,4 Previous studies have investigated the effects of 
n-3 PUFAs (including the long-chain n-3 and α-linolenic acid 
[ALA]) on CHD risk,5,6 but the relation between intake of n-6 
PUFAs and risk of CHD has been studied less extensively.

Editorial see p 1562 

Clinical Perspective on p 1578

Some  observational  studies  and  many  controlled  feeding 
studies have documented that linoleic acid (LA), the predomi-
nant n-6 PUFA in the Western diet and primarily from vegetable 
oils (eg, sunflower, safflower, soya, and corn) and nuts, reduces 
major risk factors for CHD. Higher LA intake reduces low-den-
sity  lipoprotein  cholesterol,7–10  promotes  insulin  sensitivity,7,11 
and  reduces  risk  of  hypertension.12,13  Therefore,  substitution 
of  dietary  n-6  PUFAs  for  SFAs  has  long  been  recommended 
to  prevent  CHD.1  However,  concerns  have  been  raised  about 
higher LA consumption being harmful to heart health because 
of potential proinflammatory and thrombogenic properties.14–17 
LA can be elongated to arachidonic acid (AA) and subsequently 
synthesized to a variety of proinflammatory eicosanoids, which

may  increase  CHD  risk.18–20  However,  this  speculation  is  not 
supported by randomized controlled feeding studies, in which 
dietary intake of LA was not found to increase inflammatory 
markers,  including  C-reactive  protein,  cytokines,  fibrinogen, 
soluble  vascular  adhesion  molecules,  plasminogen  activator 
inhibitor type 1, or tumor necrosis factor-α.21

Recently,  a  secondary  analysis  of  a  small  clinical  trial  con-
ducted  in  the  1960s  suggested  that  substituting  high-LA  saf-
flower oil for saturated fat increased cardiovascular mortality.17 
In  addition,  the  authors  conducted  an  updated  meta-analysis 
of LA intervention trials (high-LA oils without n-3 fatty acids, 
such as corn oil and safflower oil), which showed nonsignificant 
trends toward increased risks of CHD death, whereas the trials 
using high-LA oils with n-3 fatty acids (eg, soybean oil) showed 
opposite trends.17 However, these trials were small with limited 
power, and most of them were conducted in patients with exist-
ing heart diseases. More recently, Chowdhury et al22 reported no 
significant association between n-6 PUFAs and coronary events 
in a meta-analysis and concluded that the evidence did not sup-
port  current  recommendations  to  replace  SFAs  with  PUFAs. 
However, this analysis was based on a limited number of studies. 
Moreover, the meta-analysis could not compare LA with satu-
rated fat or any other specific macronutrient. To address the role 
of LA in primary prevention of CHD using published data on LA 
and CHD events, as well as data from unpublished cohort studies, 
we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of prospec-
tive cohort studies to examine the association between dietary LA 
intake and CHD end points in generally healthy populations.

Subjects and Methods

Study Strategy
We followed the checklist of MOOSE (Meta-Analysis of Observational 
Studies in Epidemiology) for background, design, analysis, and inter-
pretation.23  We  conducted  a  systematic  literature  search  of  2  data-
bases, MEDLINE and EMBASE, related articles, hand-searching of 
key journals and references, and direct author contacts for all cohort 
studies describing the association of dietary LA intake with incident 
CHD outcomes, which include myocardial infarction, ischemic heart 
disease,  sudden  cardiac  arrest,  acute  coronary  syndrome,  and  CHD 
deaths. Our search terms combined the exposure (LA) with various 
CHD  outcomes,  and  the  full  details  on  the  search  strategy  are  pre-
sented in the online-only Data Supplement. Searches included the ear-
liest available online indexing year up to June 30, 2013.

Selection of Articles
The titles and abstracts of the identified studies were screened by 1 
investigator (M.S.F.) for potentially relevant articles. Two investiga-
tors (M.S.F. and M.D.) independently assessed the full text of those 
selected articles to determine relevant articles for inclusion; any dis-
crepancies were resolved by consultation with the third investigator 
(F.B.H.). Studies were included if they were prospective cohort stud-
ies that provided multivariate-adjusted risk estimates (relative risk 
[RR] or hazard ratio) for dietary LA consumption as the exposure 
and CHD end points. We excluded retrospective, cross-sectional, or 
ecological studies, studies in nonadults (<19 years old), nonoriginal 
papers (reviews, editorials, or letters), meeting abstracts, and dupli-
cated publications. We also excluded studies conducted in patients 
with  known  CHD  at  baseline.  For  multiple  manuscripts  that  pub-
lished from the same cohort, the most up-to-date analyses with the 
highest number of outcomes were included in the meta-analysis.

The search strategy identified 8782 unique citations (Figure 1). After 
screening the titles and abstracts, 566 full-text articles were evaluated, 
with 6 original articles being identified as appropriate for inclusion in

this meta-analysis.24–29 We also obtained permission from principal inves-
tigators of the cohort studies presented in the Pooling Project of Cohort 
Studies  on  Diet  and  Coronary  Disease4  to  examine  the  association 
between LA intake and CHD risk and included these results in the meta-
analysis. The characteristics of these cohort studies in the pooling project 
were described in detail previously.4 Among 11 cohort studies included in 
the Pooling Project of Cohort Studies on Diet and Coronary Disease, we 
used data of the 6 cohort studies (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities 
Study  [ARIC],  Finnish  Mobile  Clinic  Health  Study  [FMC],  Israeli 
Ischemic  Heart  Disease  Study  [IIHD],  Iowa  Women’s  Health  Study 
[IWHS], Västerbotten Intervention Program [VIP], and Women’s Health 
Study [WHS]), to assess the association between LA and total CHD and 
CHD deaths.4 The results for associations of LA and CHD events have 
been published previously in the Nurses’ Health Study (NHS), Health 
Professional Follow-up Study (HPFS), and Alpha-Tocopherol and Beta-
Carotene Cancer Prevention (ATBC) study.26–28 Furthermore, the associa-
tion between dietary n-6 fatty acid and coronary events was evaluated 
in 8139 men and 12 535 women in the Malmo Diet and Cancer Cohort 
(MDC) study.30 The associations between LA and CHD events have been 
provided by the study investigators through personal correspondence. In 
addition, we included the results of 3 other previously published stud-
ies.24,25,29 In the NHS and HPFS, we updated the published analyses with 
longer follow-up: from 20 years in previous publications to 30 years in 
the NHS, and from 6 years to 24 years in the HPFS. In addition, we rean-
alyzed data in the ATBC study to adjust for the confounding variables 
similar  to  other  included  cohort  studies  in  this  meta-analysis  (Table). 
In studies in which the results on LA were not published previously or 
results were updated in this meta-analysis, the hazard ratios with 95% 
confidence intervals (CIs) for the incidence of CHD events were calcu-
lated by Cox proportional hazards regression models with time in study 
(years) as the time metric. The multivariate model included total energy, 
age, smoking, body mass index, physical activity, education level, alco-
hol intake, hypertension, fiber intake, and percent of energy from SFAs, 
trans-fat, monounsaturated fatty acids, ALA, PUFAs other than LA and 
ALA, and protein intake. Because of the lack of data on ALA and trans-
fat intakes in the IIHD and MDC studies, we adjusted for PUFAs other 
than LA. In this model, the hazard ratio for LA represents its substitution 
for the same percent of energy from carbohydrate.31 We also estimated 
hazard ratios of CHD for the substitution of SFAs by LA. To do this, we 
adjusted for percent of energy from carbohydrates instead of SFAs in the 
above multivariate model. The analyses were performed by SAS version 
9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).

Data Extraction
Two investigators (M.S.F. and M.D.) independently extracted informa-
tion on study characteristics (author, study name, country, and publica-
tion year), duration of follow-up (mean, median, or maximum number 
of follow-up), sample size, CHD outcomes (specific end points), sex, 
subject age (mean or median), methods for assessing LA consumption, 
covariates in the statistical models, multivariable-adjusted risk estimates, 
and precision (eg, 95% CIs, SEs, or P values). When >1 multivariable 
model was assessed or 1 article reported multiple RRs for different cor-
onary outcomes, we extracted the RRs for the most specific coronary 
outcome event (according to the following hierarchy: total CHD, CHD 
deaths, nonfatal CHD) with the largest number of adjustment variables.

Data Synthesis
The included studies reported RRs or hazard ratios of CHD events 
by categories of dietary LA intake, and RRs are assumed to be unbi-
ased estimates of hazard ratios when events are rare. Studies reported 
risk estimates based on various categories of LA intake (eg, tertiles, 
quartiles, or quintiles), and we decided to use the RRs to compare the 
highest with the lowest category. For a study29 that reported RRs with-
out  corresponding  95%  CIs,  SEs  for  the  RRs  were  estimated  from 
SE=β/ZP, where β is the regression coefficient for 1% increment of 
energy from LA, and ZP is the value of a unit-normal test statistic cor-
responding to the P value.32

Forest plots were used to evaluate RRs and corresponding 95% CIs 
for  specific  studies.  Overall  RRs  were  calculated  using  fixed-effect

models  (Mantel-Haenszel  method),  and  we  also  calculated  random-
effects models (DerSimonian and Laird method) as sensitivity analysis. 
Potential heterogeneity among studies was assessed using the I2 statis-
tic, and the heterogeneity was further explored using stratified analysis 
and  the  meta-regression  method.  Sources  of  heterogeneity  included 
duration of follow-up (less than or at least the median follow-up years 
of all cohorts), age (less than or at least the median baseline age of all 
cohorts), sex (men, women, or both), repeated measures of intake, and 
study quality score. The possibility of publication bias was evaluated 
by visual inspection of a funnel plot and the Begg test.

Potential nonlinear relations were examined using restricted cubic 
spline  models  with  3  knots  at  the  25th,  50th,  and  75th  percentiles. 
We also performed a dose–response meta-analysis using generalized 
least-squares regression (2-stage generalized least-squares for trend 
in Stata; StataCorp, College Station, TX).33 Using information on risk 
estimate, SE, median of LA intake, number of cases, person-year of 
follow-up,  or  number  of  subjects  from  all  exposure  categories,  the 
log-linear dose–response slope within each study was estimated and 
then pooled to derive an overall risk estimate. One study29 reported 
previously risk estimates for linear differences in exposure, and data 
were  added  to  the  generalized  least-squares  for  trend  model  at  the 
second stage. All analyses were performed using Stata version 12.0, 
with a 2-tailed α of 0.05 as statistical significance.

Results

Study Characteristics
The  characteristics  of  the  13  identified  cohort  studies  are 
shown in the Table. Three cohort studies (IWHS, IIHD, and 

Multiple  Risk  Factor  Intervention  Trial  [MRFIT])  did  not 
report  results  for  total  CHD,  and  4  studies  (Multinational 
Monitoring of Trends and Determinations in Cardiovascular 
Disease [MONICA], ARIC, FMC, and VIP) reported results 
separately for men and women; thus, 14 estimates were avail-
able for total CHD. Two studies (MONICA and Monitoring 
Project on Risk Factors for Chronic Diseases [MORGEN]) did 
not report results for CHD deaths, and 1 study (FMC) reported 
results separately for men and women; thus, 12 estimates were 
available for CHD deaths. The numbers of participants in each 
study ranged from 1643 to 84 566, with follow-up durations 
ranging from 5.3 to 30 years, comprising 310 602 individuals 
and 12 479 cases of total CHD events and 5882 CHD deaths. 
LA consumption varied substantially across studies, with the 
median intakes across studies ranging from 1.5% to 6.4% of 
energy  (10th  versus  90th  percent  range  from  1.1%  to  9.5% 
of energy; see online-only Data Supplement Tables I through 
IV). Except for 1 study conducted in Israel, all other studies 
were from the North American (n =6) or European countries 
(n=6). In all cohort studies, except for 2 studies (MONICA 
and MRFIT),24,29 the RRs for LA can be interpreted as effects 
of  substituting  percent  of  energy  intake  from  LA  for  the 
same percent of energy intake from carbohydrates. We were 
able to estimate the effects of substituting percent of energy 
intake  from  LA  for  the  same  amount  of  energy  from  SFAs

For unpublished and updated cohort studies, the RRs and 
95% CIs across the quintiles of LA intake and total CHD and 
CHD deaths are shown in the online-only Data Supplement 
Tables  I  through  IV.  Because  of  the  small  number  of  CHD 
events in the ARIC study in women, the FMC study in women, 
and the VIP study in men and women and the small number of 
CHD deaths in the FMC study in women, the WHS, and the 
VIP study in men, the RRs and 95% CIs across the tertiles of 
LA intake were provided.

Meta-Analysis of LA and Total CHD Events
Across 10 cohort studies that examined the association between 
LA and total CHD events (14 estimates), LA consumption was 
inversely associated with risk of total CHD events. The fixed-
effect summary of RR for comparing the highest with lowest 
category was 0.85 (95% CI, 0.78–0.92; Figure 2) with medium 
heterogeneity  (I2=35.5%).  This  finding  was  similar  using  a 
random-effects model (RR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.76–0.97).

The  meta-regression  analysis  did  not  identify  statistically 
significant sources of heterogeneity, including the mean age 
of the participants, sex, study duration, repeated measures of 
intake, or study quality score (all P>0.05).

Meta-Analysis of LA and CHD Deaths
Among  11  cohort  studies  (12  estimates)  that  examined  the 
association between LA and CHD deaths, higher LA intake 

was associated with a lower risk of CHD deaths. The fixed-
effect summary of the RR for comparing the highest with the 
lowest category was 0.79 (95% CI, 0.71–0.89; Figure 3).

Dose–Response Meta-Analyses
In the dose–response analysis, we found a linear association 
between  LA  intake  and  CHD  events  (P=0.91  for  nonlinear-
ity;  Figure  4)  and  CHD  deaths  (P=0.72  for  nonlinearity; 
Figure  5).  An  increment  of  5%  of  energy  intake  from  LA 
was  associated  with  a  10%  lower  risk  of  CHD  events  (RR, 
0.90;  95%  CI,  0.85–0.94;  I2=44.6%;  Figure  6)  and  a  13% 
lower  risk  of  CHD  deaths  (RR,  0.87;  95%  CI,  0.81–0.93; 
Figure 7). Among 9 cohort studies (12 estimates) that evalu-
ated  substitution  of  LA  for  carbohydrate,  the  risk  estimate 
for substituting 5% energy intake from LA for carbohydrates 
was 0.90 (95% CI, 0.85–0.94; I2=47.3%; see online-only Data

energy from SFAs (RR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.82–0.94; see online-
only Data Supplement Figure IV).

Publication Bias
For dietary LA intake, visual inspection of a funnel plot (see 
online-only Data Supplement Figures V and VI) and the Begg 
test suggested no evidence of publication bias for either CHD 
events (P=0.25) or CHD deaths (P=1.00).

Discussion

This systematic review and meta-analysis support a significant 
inverse association between dietary LA intake, when replacing 
either carbohydrates or saturated fat, and risk of CHD. Our dose–
response analyses identified a lower risk of both total CHD events 
and CHD deaths with increasing LA intake in a linear manner. 
These associations were independent of traditional CHD risk fac-
tors and other dietary factors, such as fiber and ALA.

An inverse association between intake of PUFAs and CHD 
was  reported  in  a  pooled  analysis  of  11  prospective  cohort 
studies in the United States, Europe, and Israel.4 In that pooled 
analysis  with  a  wide  range  of  PUFA  intake  (from  1.7%  to 
10.6%), each 5% lower energy intake from SFAs and a con-
comitant  higher  energy  from  PUFAs  were  associated  with 
13% lower risk of coronary events and 26% lower risk of cor-
onary death.4 Consistent with that analyses, our meta-analysis 
suggests that intake of LA, the predominant n-6 PUFA, has 

cardio-protective effects: a 5% increase in energy from LA, 
replacing  SFAs,  was  associated  with  9%  lower  risk  of  total 
CHD and 13% lower risk of CHD deaths. A comparison of 
our findings with those of clinical trials of PUFA consumption 
is also informative. In a meta-analysis of 8 randomized con-
trolled trials, Mozaffarian et al3 found that each 5% increase in 
energy from PUFAs, replacing SFAs, would reduce the occur-
rence of coronary events by 10%.

An  inverse  association  between  LA  and  CHD  has  also 
been  seen  in  most  previous  studies  of  LA  biomarkers  and 
CHD events. In a meta-analysis of 22 studies, including case-
control and prospective cohort data, blood/tissue LA concen-
trations  were  inversely  associated  with  nonfatal  CHD  end 
points.34 Even in a population with high PUFA intake (mean 
intake, 10.1% of energy) and very high LA adipose tissue con-
tent (25.6% of adipose tissue composition), a nonsignificant 
inverse association was found between adipose LA and acute 
myocardial infarction after controlling for other n-6 PUFAs.35
Concerns  about  recommendations  for  diets  high  in  LA 
have been based on the assumption that AA produced from 
metabolism  of  LA  is  the  main  precursor  of  eicosanoids 
with  inflammatory  and  thrombogenic  properties,  such  as 
prostaglandin E2, thromboxane A2, and leukotriene B4.15,36 
However,  conversion  of  LA  to  AA  is  tightly  controlled, 
variations in dietary LA intake do not appreciably modify 
tissue AA content,37,38 and adipose tissue AA concentrations

mation and thrombosis, such as prostacyclin, epoxyeicosa-
trienoic acids, and lipoxin A4 are produced from AA.39,40 In 
an Italian adult population, higher plasma levels of AA were

higher  levels  of  anti-inflammatory  markers.41 Although  in

not  supported  in  a  meta-analysis  of  20  prospective  and

beneficial effects of n-3 PUFAs on CHD risk by competi-
tion  in  elongation  and  desaturation  pathways.43,44  Because 
of  multiple,  potentially  competing  effects  on  many  meta-
bolic pathways, the effects of LA on heart disease risks are 
difficult  to  predict  by  these  mechanistic  considerations. A 
diet high in LA is considered to increase lipid susceptibil-
ity to free radical oxidation and lipid peroxidation that may 
play a role in the pathogenesis of cancer.45 However, in the 
extensive literature on this topic, including many prospec-
tive studies and meta-analyses, there is little evidence that 
higher intake of LA is associated with an increased risk of 
cancer in prospective studies.46–48

Recommendations to reduce LA in the diet are based on 
minimal  direct  evidence.14–17  Ramsden  et  al17  investigated 
the effects of increasing LA alone and LA in combination 
with ALA on CHD mortality in men with recent coronary 
events in a single-blinded, randomized controlled trial that 
was  conducted  in  the  1960s  in Australia.  They  suggested 
that  n-6  LA  alone  increased  the  risk  of  CHD  mortality. 
However, the study sample size was very small (n=221), and 
the  95%  CIs  for  the  estimates  were  wide  (RR,  1.74;  95% 
CI, 1.04–2.92). The duration of the study was also short (39 
months).  In  addition,  partial  hydrogenation  of  vegetable 
oils  was  a  common  practice  in  the  1960s,  and  the  results 
may have been confounded by trans-fat in the special mar-
garines high in LA. Also, by replacing dietary fats as much 

as possible with oils high in LA but with little n-3 PUFAs, 
any adverse effects may have been attributable to low n-3 
PUFAs rather than high LA.

Potential limitations to this study should be considered. As 
in any meta-analysis, publication bias is possible. However, 
significant publication bias was not indicated through visual 
inspection  of  funnel  plots  and  the  Begg  test.  We  cannot 
exclude  the  possibility  of  residual  confounding  attributable 
to the observational nature of the included studies. However, 
most of the studies adjusted for major CHD risk factors and 
other dietary sources of energy. In most of the studies, diet 
was assessed using a food-frequency questionnaire, and thus 
measurement errors may be introduced by the under-report-
ing or over-reporting of the amounts of food groups usually 
eaten per day. In addition, because food-frequency question-
naires  used  in  some  studies  did  not  query  brand  names  of 
margarine, cooking oils, salad dressings, and other foods con-
taining LA, the intake levels of LA may be underestimated in 
these studies.

Our  analysis  has  several  strengths.  Our  comprehen-
sive  search  methods,  personal  contacts  with  authors  and 
experts,  and  inclusion  of  unpublished  data  in  several 
cohorts (ARIC, FMC, IIHD, IWHS, VIP, WHS, and MDC), 
as well as updated analyses in some cohorts (NHS, HPFS, 
and ATBC), minimized misclassification and potential for 
publication  bias.  We  limited  our  analysis  to  prospective

cohort  studies  to  minimize  the  influence  of  recall  and 
selection biases that are common in case-control studies. 
Also, most studies adjusted for potential CHD risk factors 
and  other  types  of  dietary  fat.  Despite  variations  in  LA 
measurement  methods,  population  characteristics,  study 
design,  and  specific  outcomes  evaluated  in  the  included 
cohort  studies,  there  was  low-to-moderate  heterogeneity 
across  studies,  which  supports  the  validity  of  the  pooled 
results. In our meta-analysis, except for the MONICA and 
MRFIT  studies,24,29  all  other  cohort  studies  adjusted  for 
energy from other fat components (SFAs, trans-fat, mono-
unsaturated  fatty  acids,  and  PUFAs  other  than  LA).  It  is 
worth noting that the inverse association between LA and 
CHD  was  independent  of ALA  intake.  In  these  analyses, 
the association between LA and CHD was compared with 
that  for  CHD  with  both  carbohydrate  and  saturated  fat 
intakes. Other advantages included the ability to evaluate 
the association of LA intake and CHD events in different 
populations with different diets, including large variations 
in intakes of LA.

Conclusions

This current systematic review and meta-analysis of prospec-
tive  cohort  studies  of  LA  consumption  provides  robust  evi-
dence that higher LA intake is associated with lower risk of 
CHD in a dose–response manner. These data support current 

recommendations to replace saturated fat with LA for primary 
prevention of CHD in the general population.

CLINICAL PERSPECTIvE

Previous studies on intake of linoleic acid (LA), the predominant n-6 fatty acid that is mainly derived from vegetable oils, nuts, 
and seeds, and risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) have generated inconsistent results. We performed a systematic review and 
meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies to summarize the evidence regarding the relation of dietary LA intake and CHD 
risk. We identified 13 published and unpublished cohort studies with a total of 310 602 individuals and 12 479 total CHD events, 
including 5882 CHD deaths. Comparing the highest with the lowest category, dietary LA was associated with a 15% (95% confi-
dence interval, 8–22%) lower risk of CHD events and a 21% (95% confidence interval, 11–29%) lower risk of CHD deaths. A 5% 
of energy increment in LA intake replacing the same amount of energy from saturated fat intake was associated with a 9% (95% 
confidence interval, 4–13%) lower risk of CHD events and a 13% (95% confidence interval, 6–18%) lower risk of CHD deaths. 
This meta-analysis indicates that dietary LA intake is inversely associated with CHD risk in a dose–response manner. These data 
provide support for current recommendations to replace saturated fat with polyunsaturated fat for primary prevention of CHD.

ABSTRACT Palm oil and soybean oil are the 2 most widely used cooking oils in the world. Palm oil is consumed
mainly in developing countries, where morbidity and mortality due to cardiovascular disease (CVD) are on the rise.
Although claims about adverse or protective effects of these oils are commonly made, there are no epidemiologic
studies assessing the association between these oils and cardiovascular disease endpoints. We examined whether
consumption of palm oil relative to soybean oil and other unsaturated oils (predominantly sunﬂower) is associated
with myocardial infarction (MI) in Costa Rica. The cases (n ⫽ 2111) were survivors of a ﬁrst acute MI and were
matched to randomly selected population controls (n ⫽ 2111). Dietary intake was assessed with a validated
semiquantitative FFQ. Adipose tissue proﬁles of essential fatty acids were assessed to validate cooking oil intake
and found to be consistent with self-reported major oils used for cooking. The data were analyzed using conditional
logistic regression. Palm oil users were more likely to have an MI than users of soybean oil [odds ratio (OR) ⫽ 1.33;
95% CI: 1.08 –1.63] or other cooking oils (OR ⫽ 1.23; CI: 0.99 –1.52), but they did not differ from users of soybean
oil with a high trans-fatty acid content (OR ⫽ 1.14; CI: 0.84 –1.56). These data suggest that as currently used in
Costa Rica, and most likely in many other developing countries, the replacement of palm oil with a polyunsaturated
nonhydrogenated vegetable oil would reduce the risk of MI.

KEY WORDS:

●

fatty acids ● palm oil ● soybean oil ● myocardial infarction ● cardiovascular disease

Palm oil and soybean oil are the 2 most used cooking oils
worldwide (1). Palm oil is less expensive than soybean oil and
has more diverse uses in nonfood industries. The palm oil
industry is a major source of income for many people in the
rural areas of many developing countries (2). Most of the
production (84%) occurs in South East Asia (1), and most of
the palm oil (84 –90%) is used in food preparation. Palm oil is
consumed mainly in developing countries (1) that are under-
going an adverse nutritional transition and in which morbidity
and mortality due to cardiovascular disease (CVD)4 are in-
creasing (3–5). Soybean oil, produced mainly in the United
States, Brazil, and Argentina as a secondary product of the
soybean protein meal industry, is rich in cis-PUFAs. Because
soybean oil is usually partially hydrogenated, it has a high
content of trans-PUFAs. The atherogenic potential of palm oil
was proposed because it is low in polyunsaturated and high in
saturated fat (36 –50%), predominantly palmitic acid (6 – 8).

High palm oil and coconut oil intakes were proposed as po-
tential explanations for the high cardiovascular disease rates in
Singapore compared with Hong Kong (5). Studies in humans
and animals showed that palm oil per se compared with
safﬂower oil or sunﬂower oil increased plasma total and LDL
cholesterol (9 –13), and compared with safﬂower oil, palm oil
caused atherosclerosis in monkeys (14). Other studies showed
no or the opposite effect (15). In contrast, soybean oil and
other oils rich in PUFAs are considered beneﬁcial for cardio-
vascular health (16,17). Nevertheless, a large proportion of
soybean oil is partially hydrogenated, a procedure that gener-
ates trans fatty acids, which are associated with increased risk
of coronary heart disease (18,19). Despite the worldwide eco-
nomic and health importance of palm oil and soybean oil,
there are no epidemiologic studies assessing the association
between these oils and cardiovascular endpoints. We con-
ducted a large population-based incident case-control study to
determine whether the use of palm oil compared with other
cooking oils was associated with the risk of nonfatal acute
myocardial
infarction (MI). Unlike soybean oil, which is
mostly imported, palm oil is produced and used widely for
cooking in Costa Rica (7,20).

published elsewhere (21–23). Brieﬂy, eligible case subjects were men
and women who were diagnosed as survivors of a ﬁrst acute MI by 2
independent cardiologists at any of the 6 recruiting hospitals in the
catchment area. To achieve 100% ascertainment, ﬁeldworkers visited
the 6 hospitals daily. All cases met the WHO criteria for MI, which
require typical symptoms plus either elevations in cardiac enzyme
levels or diagnostic changes in the electrocardiogram (24). Cases
were ineligible if they 1) died during hospitalization, 2) were ⱖ75 y
old on the day of their ﬁrst MI, and 3) were physically or mentally
unable to answer the questionnaire. Enrollment took place while
cases were in the hospital’s step-down-unit. Cases were matched by
age (⫾5 y), sex, and area of residence to population controls who
were randomly identiﬁed with the aid of data from the National
Census and Statistics Bureau of Costa Rica. Because of the compre-
hensive social services provided in Costa Rica, all persons living in
the catchment area had access to medical care without regard to
income. Therefore, control subjects came from the source population
that gave rise to the cases and were not likely to have been having
undiagnosed cardiovascular disease because of poor access to medical
care. Control subjects were ineligible if they had ever had an MI or
if they were physically or mentally unable to answer the question-
naires. Participation was 98% for cases and 88% for controls. All
subjects gave informed consent on documents approved by the Hu-
man Subjects Committee of the Harvard School of Public Health and
the University of Costa Rica.

Data collection. Trained personnel visited all cases and controls
at their homes for the collection of dietary and health information,
anthropometric measurements, and biological specimens. Sociode-
mographic characteristics, smoking, socioeconomic status, physical
activity, and medical history data were collected during an interview
using a questionnaire with close-ended questions. Self-reported dia-
betes and hypertension were validated using the recommended deﬁ-
nitions by the Expert Committee on the Diagnosis and Classiﬁcation
of Diabetes Mellitus (25), and the Third Joint National Committee
on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure
(26). We computed sensitivities, speciﬁcities, and positive and neg-
ative predictive values from the questionnaire data and measurements
of blood pressure and blood sugar. These variables showed that
self-reported assessments of diabetes and hypertension were reliable
in this population (21).

Dietary assessment. We collected dietary data using a FFQ that
was developed and validated speciﬁcally to assess nutrient intake
among the Costa Rican population (22,27). The FFQ asked subjects
to specify the principal type of oil used for cooking and frying at home
and the duration of use. The type of oil was conﬁrmed by visual
inspection of the oil containers at the time of the home visit. The
cooking oils were coded and periodic assessments of the fatty acid
compositions of samples from the market in Costa Rica were per-
formed at Harvard School of Public Health using a GLC procedure
described elsewhere (27).

The fatty acid composition of the most widely used oils and
margarines in Costa Rica were incorporated into the food composi-
tion database. The proportions of saturated, monounsaturated, poly-
unsaturated, and trans fatty acids in palm oil (mostly consumed in
solid form) were 49.7, 39.0, 9.6, and 1.7%, respectively. Partially
hydrogenated soybean oil brands used in Costa Rica between 1994
and 1998 were high in trans fatty acids (22 ⫾ 4%) and low in
␣-linolenic acid (1.8 ⫾ 0.3%). After changes in the edible oil
industry in Costa Rica, the trans fatty acid content of soybean oil was
reduced to 5 ⫾ 3%, and the ␣-linolenic acid content increased to 5.1
⫾ 0.7%. The trans fatty acid content of palm oil did not change over
the years, and was 1.5 ⫾ 0.3% in our recent analyses. The trans fatty
acid contents of other cooking oils analyzed were relatively low; they
were 0.17 ⫾ 0.34% for sunﬂower oil, 0.11 ⫾ 0.35% for corn oil, 0.06
⫾ 0.13% for canola oil, and 0.02 ⫾ 0.04% for olive oil. The fatty acid
compositions of the palm and soybean oils consumed by the Costa
Rican population are comparable to those of the palm and soybean
oils consumed by other populations (7,28).

Adipose tissue fatty acids. A subcutaneous adipose tissue biopsy
was collected from the upper buttock, stored in a cooler with ice
packs at 4°C, transported to the ﬁeldwork station within 4 h, and
stored at ⫺80°C until analysis. Fatty acids from adipose tissue were

quantiﬁed by GLC as described previously (27). Fatty acids in sub-
cutaneous adipose tissue reﬂect long-term intake (29,30) and are
preferred in case-control studies over other biomarkers of fatty acid
intake (31). In the Costa Rican population, adipose tissue linoleic
acid, ␣-linolenic acid, and trans fatty acids were found to be excellent
biomarkers of intake (22,27). We used cis- and trans-PUFAs in
adipose tissue to identify and conﬁrm the presence of fatty acids that
are likely to be responsible for the observed results.

To avoid the potential for recall bias among cases, data were
collected as close to the diagnosis of MI as possible. For instance, data
collection was completed within 2 wk of discharge from the hospital
for 73% of the cases. A matched population control was recruited
within 10 ⫾ 11 d of the recruitment of a case. The mean (SD)
interval between completion of data collection for a case and com-
pletion of data collection for a matched control was 12 (16) d.

Statistical analysis. SAS Software version 8.00 (SAS Institute)
was used for all statistical analyses. Subjects who were missing values
(n ⫽ 326) for major confounders were excluded, leaving 2111 cases
and 2111 matched population controls for the ﬁnal analysis. If a case
or control was missing data on key variables, the whole pair was
deleted. If among deleted controls there was one that had complete
data and matched a deleted case by age, sex, and area of residence, the
2 were rematched and added to the data set to avoid power loss. Thus,
32 cases and 32 rematched controls with complete data were included
in the ﬁnal data set for a total of 2111 case-control pairs. Because
individual nutrients were correlated with total energy intake, each
was adjusted for energy intake using regression methods (22,32). We
also estimated the amount of energy consumed as fat and expressed it
as a percentage of daily total energy intake. Because of the matched
design, the signiﬁcance of differences in the distributions of categor-
ical variables by case-control status was tested using McNemar’s test;
continuous variables were tested by the paired t test, if normally
distributed, or by the Wilcoxon signed rank test, if not normally
distributed. Differences were considered signiﬁcant at P ⱕ 0.05.

Because the content of trans fatty acids in soybean oil brands used
before 1998 was ⬎16%, and ⬍10% for those used after 1998, we
grouped together all brands before 1998 (mean trans content 22%)
and those after 1998 (mean trans content 5%). We then divided
soybean oil users into 2 groups, namely, users of soybean oil with high
trans content (22%) and users of soybean oil with less trans fat (5%).
This is because our earlier analyses (18) showed that a high intake of
trans fat, which in this population comes mainly from partial hydro-
genation of soybean oil, is associated with increased risk of MI. If not
adjusted for, high trans fat intake in the reference group could
confound any association between palm oil and MI. There were fewer
users of oils other than palm oil or soybean oil (n ⫽ 977); therefore,
they were grouped together in a category called other oils, which
included consumers of sunﬂower oil (53%), corn oil (27%), olive oil
(10%), canola oil (3%), and a few less common oils (7%). We thus
modeled a 4-level categorical variable (palm oil, soybean oil with
22% trans fat, soybean oil with 5% trans fat, and other oils) as the
main predictor of MI. In the analyses, palm oil was compared with
soybean oil with 22% trans fat, soybean oil with 5% trans fat, or other
oils as reference categories.

We assessed variables for confounding ﬁrst by determining their
univariate associations with MI and the type of oil used for cooking;
second, we investigated the change in odds ratios (OR) when a given
variable was entered into the conditional logistic regression model. In
these analyses, continuous variables were analyzed as quintiles of
nondietary or energy-adjusted dietary variables. We assessed the
possibility of an association between palm oil consumption and MI,
ﬁrst univariately, then with established CVD risk factors only, and
ﬁnally with dietary confounders assessed with an FFQ. Multivariate
OR and 95% CI were obtained for palm oil using 22% trans-soybean
oil, 5% trans-soybean oil, or other oils as the referent group. All 3
analyses used a ﬁxed sample size of 2111 case-control pairs and the
same set of covariates.

To determine whether there was a dose-response relation between
the use of palm oil and MI, we reanalyzed the data using the estimated
daily amount of palm oil (expressed as a percentage of total energy
intake) consumed at home. This analysis was made for 926 subjects
who provided their food preparation recipes for use in estimating the

intake of palm oil. We used the median to divide palm oil users into
2 equal groups (low and high palm oil users) and then compared them
to subjects who did not use palm oil (0% of energy from palm oil).
Thus we had a 3-level categorical variable in which those below and
above the median of palm oil intake were compared with non-palm
oil users. Because mixing of cooking oils is not common in Costa Rica
and the variable for intake of soybean oil was negatively correlated
with that of palm oil, we only used the palm oil variable in the
multivariate dose-response analyses. Multivariate unconditional OR
and 95% CI were estimated for the low and high palm oil users
relative to non-palm oil users. These unconditional logistic analyses
controlled for age (quintiles), sex, area of residence, smoking (never,
past, ⬍20 cigarettes/d, and ⱖ20 cigarettes/d), history of diabetes,
history of hypertension, abdominal obesity (quintiles), physical ac-
tivity (quintiles), income (quintiles), intake of alcohol (never, past,
and tertiles of current drinkers), total energy (quintiles), ﬁber (quin-
tiles), dairy, and meat products (continuous), and trans fat in adipose
tissue (quintiles).

We performed additional analyses to further explore the effects of
potential confounders such as smoking, area of residence, ␣-linolenic
acid in adipose tissue, intake of folate, alcohol, and vitamin B-6 by
stratifying the analyses by these variables. In these analyses, we used
unconditional
logistic regression with matching variables in the
model and the other variables modeled as continuous covariates. We
computed the Hosmer-Lemeshow statistic to test for goodness of ﬁt.

RESULTS

General characteristics. Characteristics of nonfatal MI
cases and population-based matched controls in Costa Rica
were compared (Table 1). The cases had a higher number (P
⬍ 0.05) of current smokers and individuals with a history of
diabetes and hypertension. Compared with controls, cases also
had higher (P ⬍ 0.05) abdominal obesity, less income, fewer
current alcohol drinkers, and higher intakes of total energy
and saturated fat but less polyunsaturated fat. Intakes of ␣-to-
copherol, ␥-tocopherol, and adipose tissue concentrations of
most carotenoids were signiﬁcantly lower in cases than in
controls (data not shown). The distribution of potential con-
founders was examined by the type of oil used for cooking
(Table 2). Use of palm oil was associated with the area of
residence in both cases and controls. Most palm oil users were
of low socioeconomic status as shown by their income and
level of education, were physically more active, and were more
likely to be current smokers than users of other cooking oils.
Palm oil was used more frequently (P ⬍ 0.01) for cooking by
cases (30%) than by controls (23%). Compared with soybean
oil and other oil users, palm oil consumers had higher intakes
of saturated fat and lower intakes of total polyunsaturated fat
and ␣-linolenic acid. The difference in intake of saturated fat
was due mainly to palmitic acid.
Type of cooking oil and MI.

In the analysis adjusted for
age, gender, and area of residence through matching (Table
3), consumption of palm oil compared with soybean oil (con-
taining 22% trans fat) was associated with increased risk of MI
(OR ⫽ 1.40; 95% CI: 1.07–1.82). Adjusting for smoking,
alcohol intake, history of diabetes, history of hypertension,
abdominal obesity, physical activity, and income attenuated
the association (OR ⫽ 1.16; 95% CI: 0.86 –1.56), mainly
because of the high number of current smokers in the palm oil
group and less abdominal obesity in the soybean oil group.
Further adjustment for energy and ﬁber intake did not change
the association appreciably (OR ⫽ 1.14; 95% CI: 0.84 –1.56).
Compared with users of soybean oil with 5% trans fat, palm
oil consumers were more likely to have an MI (OR ⫽ 1.39;
95% CI: 1.16 –1.65). Adjustment for dietary and nondietary
confounders as above did not change the association appre-
ciably (OR ⫽ 1.33; 95% CI: 1.08 –1.63).

Compared with other types of cooking oils that are very low
in trans fatty acids, palm oil was signiﬁcantly associated with
increased risk for MI (OR ⫽ 1.53; 95% CI: 1.27–1.84). Ad-
justment for dietary and nondietary confounders as in the
preceding models attenuated the association appreciably (OR
⫽ 1.23; 95% CI: 0.99 –1.52), mainly because of the high
proportion of smokers among palm oil users (29%) compared
with users of other cooking oils (14%).

In a multivariate dose-response analysis, we found that
relative to non-palm oil users (0% energy from palm oil), the
risk of MI among low (median intake ⫽ 3.5% of energy) and
high (median intake ⫽ 7.4% energy) palm oil users was 1.27
(95% CI: 0.84 –1.94) and 1.48 (95% CI: 0.95–2.33), respec-
tively (data not shown).

We also determined whether total fat or saturated fat intake
was associated with the risk of MI. As in our previous study
(23), the total amount of fat consumed was not associated with
MI (OR for the 5th vs. 1st quintile ⫽ 1.02; 95% CI: 0.80 –
1.30) but saturated fat was signiﬁcantly associated with the risk
of MI (OR for the 5th vs. 1st quintile ⫽ 1.36; 95% CI:
1.05–1.75) (data not shown).

adipose tissue between palm oil consumers and users of other
cooking oils (Fig. 1). Compared with palm oil users, linoleic
acid, ␣-linolenic acid, and trans fat were higher among users of
soybean oil and other oils. Adipose tissue linoleic acid and
␣-linolenic acid were highest in users of soybean oil contain-
ing 5% trans fatty acids. In contrast, trans fat was highest
among users of soybean oil with 22% trans fat. Although
linoleic acid in adipose tissue of consumers of other oils was
comparable to that of users of soybean oil with 5% trans fat,
users of other oils were lower in ␣-linolenic acid. These
adipose tissue fatty acid proﬁles are consistent with the self-
reported major oils used for cooking and indicate long-term
intake. Most cooking oil users reported consuming oils for a
relatively long period of time e.g., 17 ⫾ 8 y for palm oil, 12

oil with less trans fat, and 5 ⫾ 6 y for users of other oils.

Because smoking was a major confounder in conditional
analyses, we reassessed the association between palm oil and
MI among nonsmokers and current smokers, separately. The
results from these analyses were similar to those in Table 3.
Analyses stratiﬁed by residence also revealed that palm oil was
positively associated with MI, irrespective of the area of resi-
dence. In all of the above analyses, adjustment for dietary

Costa Rica than in Westernized countries; thus, the bulk of
saturated fat would be from vegetable oils.

The low content of linoleic and ␣-linolenic acids in palm
oil could have contributed to the observed positive association
between palm oil and MI. Linoleic acid and ␣-linolenic acid,
as well as other (n-3) and (n-6) fatty acids, protect against
coronary heart disease (16,17,33). Linoleic acid lowers total
and LDL cholesterol and may improve insulin sensitivity
(17,33). ␣-Linolenic acid may protect against MI by inhibiting
platelet aggregation and thrombosis, reducing blood pressure,
and preventing cardiac arrhythmias. These effects can be
achieved directly by ␣-linolenic acid or through its conversion
to long-chain (n-3) fatty acids, including eicosapentaenoic
acid and docosahexaenoic acid (16,17,33). If trans fatty acids
were eliminated from soybean oil, as is the current trend in
Costa Rica, the amount of available ␣-linolenic acid in soy-
bean oil would be higher and the beneﬁcial effects of this oil
compared with palm oil might also be greater.

The other oils, mainly sunﬂower oil, also were protective
compared with palm oil. Although the trans fatty acid content
of adipose tissue of users of other oils was comparable to that
of users of soybean oil with less trans fatty acids, their ␣-lin-
olenic acid content was lower. It is possible that this lower
␣-linolenic acid accounts in part for the difference in OR
when palm oil is compared with soybean oil (OR ⫽ 1.33; 95%
CI: 1.08 –1.63) or other oils (OR ⫽ 1.23; 95% CI: 0.99 –1.52).
There were no signiﬁcant differences (OR ⫽ 1.14; 95% CI:
0.84 –1.56) between palm oil and soybean oil with high trans
fatty acids content. This is likely to be due to the increase in
risk of MI in the reference group that is attributable to the
high trans fatty acids and low ␣-linolenic acid in the soybean
oil. Partial hydrogenation of soybean oil destroys ␣-linolenic
acid, increases the trans fatty acid content of soybean oil, and
may therefore raise the risk of MI among consumers of partially
hydrogenated soybean oil. Our previous studies showed that
trans fatty acids increase risk (18), whereas (n-3) fatty acids
such as ␣-linolenic acid (16) protect against the risk of MI in
this population. These data also suggest that the potentially
positive characteristics of palm oil such as its high oleic acid
content (39%) are not sufﬁcient to compensate for the dele-
terious effects of its attendant high saturated fat and low
concentrations of linoleic acid and ␣-linolenic acid.

Because part of the reason for increased risk of MI among
palm oil users may be attributed to low intake of polyunsatu-
rated fat, and because palm oil is the cheapest oil available to
most people in developing countries, replacing palm oil with
unsaturated cooking oils may not be a practical solution in the
short term. This is because the palm oil industry is a major
source of employment and income for many people who might
not be able to afford other oils. Despite these social concerns,
which could be addressed in the long term by redirecting palm
oil to other nonhuman food uses, it is important to attend to
the health concerns of palm oil consumers. The increase in the
risk of MI associated with palm oil use that was demonstrated
in this study is important to public health. Production and
consumption of palm oil are widespread and on the increase
(1,34), especially in those developing countries in which dis-
eases of afﬂuence are also increasing (3,35–37). In Costa Rica,
for instance, CVD is a leading cause of death, with ischemic
heart disease accounting for 47.2% of CVD deaths (38).

In the dose-response analysis, we noted that the difference
in risk of MI between low (3.5% energy) and high (7.4%
energy) palm oil users was not substantial, suggesting that the
type of oil used for cooking and frying is more important than
the amount of oil used. It is therefore possible that recom-
mending a decrease in intake of palm oil may not have a

(29.5%), olive oil (10.5%), canola oil (2.5%), and less common oils and

variables (e.g., intake of folate) did not change the results
appreciably.

DISCUSSION

In this study we demonstrated that the use of palm oil
compared with soybean oil and other cooking oils is indepen-
dently associated with increased risk of MI. This association is
not likely to have been confounded by age, gender, area of
residence, income, lifestyle, or dietary intake because of the
study’s matched design, the restriction of recruitment to sur-
vivors of a ﬁrst nonfatal acute MI, the use of randomly selected
population controls, and the statistical adjustments for both
lifestyle and dietary variables. Our validation of reported ex-
posure (type of cooking oil) against adipose tissue fatty acid
proﬁles suggests that reported cooking oil choices are accurate
and are unlikely to be due to recall bias, and that oils may have
been consumed over a long period of time e.g., 17 y for palm
oil and 8 –10 y for soybean oil. Existence of a positive relation
in analyses stratiﬁed by smoking status or by area of residence
further suggests that the association between palm oil and MI
is not spurious.

Our data support concerns about the potential for athero-
genesis with the use of palm oil. Although our population
study did not address the mechanism by which palm oil may
increase the risk of MI, we speculate that it does so in part by
leading to an increased intake of saturated fat (⬃3% of energy/
d), an established CVD risk factor (17,23). In our previous
analyses, we showed that in Costa Rica, a high intake of
saturated fat was associated with an increased risk of MI (23).
We further showed that palmitic acid was less potent than
other saturated fatty acids but because it was consumed in large
quantities, it was likely to have a large population attributable
risk (23). It is noteworthy that adjustments for other food
sources of saturated fat had little effect on this association,
whereas adjustment for total saturated fat intake attenuated
the association between palm oil and soybean oil. In addition,
consumption of dairy and meat products is relatively lower in

signiﬁcant effect on public health unless it is replaced with
polyunsaturated oils. It would be valuable to establish per
capita consumption levels in countries that produce or import
large amounts of edible palm oil. It would also be of value to
determine the levels of saturation and concentration of anti-
oxidants in the most common brands of palm oil used for
cooking in other developing countries. In our study, palm oil
users had signiﬁcantly lower amounts of antioxidants and
␣-linolenic acid compared with soybean oil users (39).

These data show that compared with soybean oil users, the
risk of nonfatal acute MI in palm oil users is high (8 – 63%).
Because palm oil
is used widely, especially in developing
countries in which the cardiovascular disease burden is on the
increase, projected increases in palm oil consumption could
greatly affect public health. Programs that lead to the reduc-
tion in consumption of palm oil and partially hydrogenated
soybean oil or to the availability of inexpensive palm oil with
improved fatty acid composition, or the substitution of palm
oil with unsaturated cooking oils are warranted. One potential
short-term intervention is to replace saturated fat with cis-
polyunsaturated (n-3) and (n-6) fatty acids in palm oil by
mixing it with other unsaturated oils.

Summary

 

Background:  We performed this study to examine the association between egg consumption and risk of cardi-
ovascular diseases and mortality in a nationally representative cohort of 9734 adults aged 25 to 74 
years.

 Material/Methods:  Egg consumption was categorized into no or less than 1 egg, 1 to 6 eggs, or greater than 6 eggs 
per week. Cox proportional hazards analysis was used to identify the relative risk (RR) of incident 
stroke, ischemic stroke, coronary artery disease and mortality over a 20-year follow-up in all partic-
ipants and subsequently in diabetic participants.

Conclusions: 

After adjusting for differences in age, gender, race, serum cholesterol level, body mass index, dia-
betes mellitus, systolic blood pressure, educational status and cigarette smoking, no signiﬁ cant dif-
ference was observed between persons who consumed greater than 6 eggs per week compared to 
those who consume none or less than 1 egg per week in regards to any stroke (RR, 0.9; 95% con-
ﬁ dence interval (CI), 0.7 to 1.1), ischemic stroke (RR, 0.9; 95% CI, 0.7 to 1.1), or coronary artery 
disease (RR, 1.1; 95% CI, 0.9 to 1.3). In subgroup analysis among diabetics, consumption of great-
er than 6 eggs per week was associated with an increased risk of coronary artery disease (RR 2.0, 
95% CI 1.0–3.8).

Consumption of greater than 6 eggs per week (average of 1 egg or greater per day) does not in-
crease the risk of stroke and ischemic stroke. The increased risk of coronary artery disease associ-
ated with higher egg consumption among diabetics warrants further investigations.

BACKGROUND

Eggs represent an inexpensive and low calorie source of high 
quality protein, folate, riboﬂ avin, selenium, choline, and vi-
tamins A, B-12, D, and K [1]. However, because of the high 
cholesterol content, American Heart Association (AHA) 
guidelines in 1993 recommended to restrict egg consump-
tion and dietary intake to ≤300 mg/day [2]. A subsequent 
statement in 2000 [3] stated that cholesterol-rich foods such 
as egg yolks that are relatively low in saturated fatty acid con-
tent have small effects on low- density-lipoproteins (LDL) 
cholesterol levels. However, epidemiological data have sug-
gested that increased dietary cholesterol intake is associat-
ed with an increase in coronary disease risk independent 
of plasma cholesterol levels. The AHA continues to recom-
mends dietary cholesterol intake of <300 mg per day on 
average. This target can be readily achieved, even with pe-
riodic consumption of eggs and shellﬁ sh. Reduction in cho-
lesterol intake (<200 mg per day) from all dietary sources 
of cholesterol including eggs is advised for individuals with 
elevated LDL cholesterol levels, diabetes, and/or cardiovas-
cular disease. In the Third National Health and Nutrition 
Examination (NHANES III) [4], egg consumption within 
the last 24 hours prior to the interview was reported by 6551 
(24%) of the 27378 persons screened as representative of 
United States (US) population. A higher proportion of men, 
African American, and Mexican American persons reported 
consumption of eggs within the last 24 hours. Estimate for 
overall egg consumption was not reported. In the present 
study, we sought to determine the long-term risk of cardio-
vascular diseases associated with egg consumption in a na-
tionally representative cohort.

MATERIAL AND METHODS

We used the data from First National Health and Nutrition 
Examination Survey (NHANES-I) for the analysis. NHANES-I 
was conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics 
during 1971–1975 to collect health-related information on a 
probability sample of the civilian, noninstitutionalized pop-
ulation in the United States [5–8]. The NHEFS comprised a 
series of follow-up studies to provide follow-up data on these 
NHANES-I participants who were between the ages of 25 and 
74 years (at the time of the baseline survey). The NHEFS in-
cluded 4 periods of follow-up: 1982–1984, 1986, 1987, and 
1992. The 1982–1984 follow-up included tracing the cohort 
using unique identifying information; conducting person-
al interviews with subject or proxy; measuring pulse rate, 
weight, and blood pressure of surviving participants; collect-
ing hospital and nursing home records of overnight stay; 
and collecting death certiﬁ cates of decedents. Subsequent 
follow-up of the NHEFS was conducted with the same de-
sign and data collection procedures except that a 30-minute 
computer-assisted telephone interview was administered in 
place of a personal interview and no physical measurements 
were made. Tracing and data collection in the NHEFS were 
very high, with 94% of the study population traced for each 
completed wave of follow-up. The interview rates ranged 
from 91% to 96% of the participants traced. By the end of 
the 1992 NHEFS survey period, 90% of the 11,195 subjects 
not reported dead in previous surveys had been successful-
ly traced [9]. Approximately 32% of the NHEFS cohort was 
known to be deceased, with a death certiﬁ cate available for 
98% of the 4604 NHEFS decedents.

Deﬁ nitions of stroke and coronary artery disease events

Participants were considered to have experienced a stroke 
event if they were hospitalized or died during the 20-year 
follow-up period with primary diagnoses categorized by 
codes 430, 431 to 434.9 or 437.0, 437.1 according to the 
International Classiﬁ cation of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical 
Modiﬁ cation (ICD-9-CM). Our deﬁ nition of stroke event in-
cluded both ischemic and hemorrhagic events but not tran-
sient ischemic events (ICD-9-CM code 435). ICD-9-CM codes 
were assigned on the basis of the underlying cause of death 
listed on the participant’s death certiﬁ cate. Stroke events 
were further classiﬁ ed as ischemic stroke in those with 
ICD-9-CM codes 433 to 434.9 or 437.0 to 437.1. Coronary 
artery disease was deﬁ ned by presence of ICD-9-CM code 
410-414. The deﬁ nitions of stroke and cardiovascular dis-
eases were consistent with previous reports [3,4].

Deﬁ nitions of egg consumption

At baseline interview, a detailed questionnaire was used to 
inquire regarding nutritional habits. Egg consumption in-
cluded eggs eaten as in the form of fried, boiled, poached, 
deviled, or egg salad. Eggs in cooked or baked dishes (as cus-
tards, puddings) were not included. Egg consumption was 
divided into three groups i.e. no or less than 1 egg per week, 
1 to 6 eggs per week, and greater than 6 eggs per week.

Study variables

Known cardiovascular risk factors that were identiﬁ ed as 
potential confounding variables in our study of the associ-
ation between egg consumption and incident stroke and 
coronary artery disease were age, gender, race/ethnicity 
(black, white, others), systolic blood pressure, serum cho-
lesterol level, body mass index (BMI) (calculated as weight 
in kilograms divided by the square of the height in me-
ters), diabetes mellitus, and cigarette smoking (never, cur-
rent, former and unknown), and educational attainment 
(<12 years,12, and >12 years). All measurements were ob-
tained prospectively during the NHANES-I baseline inter-
view. Information regarding the status of cigarette smok-
ing was obtained from the 1982 follow-up. Socioeconomic 
data and smoking status were self-reported. Diabetes mel-
litus was determined from the patient’s report of a physi-
cian’s diagnosis. Trained examiners measured the height 
and weight of each participant during the NHANES-I phys-
ical examination.

Statistical analyses

Because the duration of follow-up varied among the partici-
pants, Cox proportional hazard analysis was used to estimate 
the relative risk (RR) for stroke, ischemic stroke, coronary 
artery disease, and mortality. We included all patients in the 
analysis and censored the data for patients who died from 
noncardiovascular causes. RR for stroke, ischemic stroke, 
coronary artery disease and mortality for various categories 
of egg consumption was estimated after adjustment for the 
established cerebrovascular risk factors. A separate analy-
sis was performed for subsets of interest comparing the ef-
fect of egg consumption on risk of stroke, ischemic stroke, 
coronary artery disease and mortality. The subsets included 
patients with hypertension deﬁ ned by blood pressure great-

RESULTS

A total of 13586 persons were followed in the NHEFS. 
Figure 1 demonstrates the reasons for exclusion of partic-
ipants from the analysis. Dietary questions regarding egg 
intake were inquired in 10717 persons. However, 983 per-
sons were excluded because of previous history of stroke 
or MI (n=741), unknown daily egg consumption (n = 169), 
or missing BMI, serum cholesterol or systolic blood pres-
sure (n=73). Of the 9734 persons included in the analysis, 
6139 (63%) and 1967 (20%) reported weekly consumption 
of 1 to 6 eggs and greater than 6 eggs, respectively; 1628 
(17%) reported no or less than 1 egg per week consump-
tion. Persons reporting an average intake of greater than 
6 eggs per week were older and those reporting an egg in-
take of 1 to 6 eggs per week were younger than those with 
no or less than 1 egg intake per week (Table 1). Persons re-
porting an average intake of greater than 6 eggs per week 
were less likely to be white and more likely to be previous 
or current cigarette smokers. Persons reporting no or less 
than 1 egg per week were more likely to be women. We did 
not observe any signiﬁ cant difference in regards to mean 
values of body-mass index, and serum cholesterol. We did 
not observe any signiﬁ cant differences between total dai-

ly dietary cholesterol intakes among strata deﬁ ned by egg 
consumption. There was no difference in total daily dietary 
cholesterol intake between participants with serum choles-
terol ≤200 mg/dL compared with those with >200mg/dl 
(371.61± 290.91 mg versus 376.44±288.60 mg).

A total of 655 strokes and 1584 MI were observed during the 
follow-up period (mean ± standard deviation) of 15.9±5.6 
years. A univariate analysis demonstrated a trend for in-
creased rates of coronary artery disease and all cause mor-
tality with intake of greater than 6 eggs per week.

In the multivariate analysis (Table 2), we did not observe any 
relationship with consumption of greater than 6 eggs per 
week and risk of stroke (RR 0.9, 95% conﬁ dence interval [CI] 
0.7–1.1) or ischemic stroke (RR 0.9, 95% CI 0.7–1.1) after 
adjusting for age, gender, race/ethnicity, systolic blood pres-
sure, diabetes mellitus, serum cholesterol, cigarette smok-
ing, educational status and body-mass index. Compared with 
persons without any egg intake or less than 1 egg per week, 
there was no signiﬁ cant difference in RR for persons with 
intake of greater than 6 eggs for risk of MI (RR 1.0, 95% 
CI 0.9–1.3) or all cause mortality (RR 1.0, 95% CI 0.9–1.1). 
We did not observe any signiﬁ cantly different risk associated 
with daily egg consumption in subgroups deﬁ ned by systo-
lic blood pressure, serum cholesterol, and cigarette smok-
ing. Among 349 diabetic persons (Table 3), we observed 
an increase risk for myocardial infarction associated week-
ly egg consumption of greater than 6 eggs per week (RR 

2.0, 95% CI 1.0–3.8). The increased risk was not observed 
for stroke or ischemic stroke. These relationships were not 
signiﬁ cant among non-diabetic patients.

DISCUSSION

We did not observe an increased risk for stroke, ischem-
ic stroke, or coronary artery disease with weekly consump-
tion of greater than 6 eggs per week or 1 egg or greater per 
day. Although previous studies have analyzed this associa-
tion (Table 4), present results are derived from a nationally 
representative probability sample of the US civilian non-in-
stitutionalized population. Therefore the results potentially 
lack the biases observed with longitudinal studies conduct-
ed on selected population samples. In a previous analysis 
[10], the association between egg consumption and risk of 
coronary artery disease and stroke in men and women was 
examined using data from two prospective cohort studies, 
the Health Professionals Follow-up Study and the Nurses 
Health Study. A total of 37851 men aged 40 to 75 years and 
80082 women aged 34 to 59 years free of cardiovascular dis-
ease, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, or cancer were fol-
lowed in this study. A total of 866 incident cases of coronary 
artery disease and 258 incident cases of stroke in men dur-
ing 8 years of follow-up and 939 incident cases of coronary 
artery disease and 563 incident cases of stroke in women 
during 14 years of follow-up. There was no association be-
tween egg consumption and risk of coronary artery disease 
or stroke in either men or women after adjustment for age,

smoking, and other potential coronary artery disease risk 
factors. In subgroup analyses, higher egg consumption ap-
peared to be associated with increased risk of coronary ar-
tery disease only among diabetic subjects. This was similar 
to the association between egg consumption and myocar-
dial infarction in diabetics observed in our study.

Another study studied a cohort of 27,529 adults who com-
pleted questionnaires in 1960 and were followed for mortal-
ity between 1960 and 1980 [11]. Within this population, egg 
consumption was positively associated with mortality because 
of all causes combined and coronary heart disease in wom-
en [11]. A review of epidemiologic data [12] relating dietary 
cholesterol and eggs to coronary disease risk reported that 
cholesterol intake was associated with a modest increase in 
the risk of coronary events. After confounding factors were 
considered, the association between cholesterol intake and 
heart disease risk was small (6% increase in risk for 200mg/
1,000kcal per day difference in cholesterol intake). Several 

studies have examined egg intake and its relationship with cor-
onary outcomes (Table 4). After adjustment for dietary con-
founders were considered, no association was seen between 
consumption of 1 egg or greater per day and the risk of cor-
onary heart disease in non-diabetic men and women.

The lack of relationship between egg consumption and car-
diovascular diseases may be attributable to lack of association 
between serum cholesterol and egg consumption. Dawber and 
colleagues [13] were unable to demonstrate any relationship 
between 912 men and women participants of the Framingham 
cohort. In the analysis of 27378 participants from NHANES 
III, there was no association between egg consumption and 
serum cholesterol after adjusting for demographic and life-
style variables. Another study [14] examined the effect of in-
creased egg consumption on serum high-density-lipoprotein 
(HDL) cholesterol in healthy individuals. After 6 weeks of ex-
tra egg consumption, serum HDL cholesterol increased by 
10% and total cholesterol increased by 4%, whereas the se-

CR6

rum triglycerides and LDL cholesterol were unchanged. In 
another study [15], eighteen healthy young volunteers on a 
lacto-vegetarian diet were given one boiled egg per day for 8 
weeks in a randomized controlled cross-over study. Compared 
to the values obtained after 8 weeks of egg-free period, the 
mean serum total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL choles-
terol, total cholesterol/HDL ratio, very-low-density-lipopro-
teins (VLDL) cholesterol and triglycerides were not signiﬁ cant-
ly different after 8 weeks of egg consumption. Another study 
[16] studied the inﬂ uence of whole fresh eggs on the serum 
cholesterol level in hospitalized patients. The patients were 
fed two eggs or the equivalent of two eggs in a custard base 
or milk shake in addition to the foods that were consumed 
in their diet pattern. The serum cholesterol level was deter-
mined before and at periods varying from 5 hr to 54 days af-
ter the consumption of the eggs. In the majority of patients, 
the serum cholesterol level did not change signiﬁ cantly 5 
hours after the consumption of 465 mg of cholesterol in an 
egg custard base or milk shake or after up to 54 days of con-
tinued consumption of two whole eggs per day.

Egg consumption also has not shown to adversely affect 
other cardiovascular risk factors. Egg consumption may be 
associated with the reduction of blood pressure [17]. In a 
cross-sectional study was conducted for 473 [18] middle-
aged Japanese men, after adjustment for age, residence, oc-
cupation, body mass index and alcohol consumption, mean 
systolic and diastolic blood pressure were inversely associat-
ed with intake frequency of eggs. The investigators attrib-
uted the reduction of blood pressure possibly through the 
intake of protein and potassium. Another controlled cross-
over trial was conducted to determine the effects of egg in-
gestion on endothelial function [19]. Nine healthy adults 
(mean age 56 years, 40% females) underwent a baseline bra-
chial artery reactivity study, and were assigned to two eggs 
or oats daily for 6 weeks in random sequence with a 4-week 
washout. A vasoreactivity test was done at the end of each 
treatment phase, measuring ﬂ ow-mediated vasodilation in 
the brachial artery using a high-frequency ultrasound. Flow 
mediated vasodilation was stable in both groups, and be-
tween-treatment differences were not signiﬁ cant.

We observed an increased risk of myocardial infarction and 
egg consumption among diabetic patients similar to a previ-
ous study. In the Zutphen Study, an oral glucose tolerance 
test was carried out in 394 non-diabetic men aged 50–70 
[20]. Egg consumption was detrimental to glucose toler-
ance. Diets containing eggs have been shown to produce 
larger glycemic and insulin responses compared to isoca-
loric breakfasts in non-insulin-dependent diabetic subjects 
[21]. Therefore, the detrimental effect of egg consump-
tion on glycemic control in diabetics may account for the 
increased risk of coronary artery disease [10].

We used primary ICD-9-CM codes from discharge documents 
and death certiﬁ cates to identify patients with stroke and stroke 
subtypes admitted to the hospital. A previous study [25] re-
ported a true positive rate of 83% for primary discharge di-
agnoses of ICD-9-CM codes 430 to 436 in a population based 
study. In another study, positive predictive values for the death 
certiﬁ cate diagnosis were 100% for all types of stroke and 97% 
for ischemic stroke compared to a standardized physician di-
agnosis [26]. On the basis of results of previous studies, we 
think that hospital discharge or death certiﬁ cate diagnoses 

are sufﬁ ciently accurate to justify their use in present studies. 
Probably more important, the validity of ICD-9 diagnoses does 
not differ by strata deﬁ ned by egg consumption.

CONCLUSIONS

CR

Our study demonstrated that consumption of greater than 
6 eggs per week or 1 egg or greater per day did not increase 
the risk of coronary artery disease, ischemic stroke, or all 
strokes in a cohort representative of US population.

ABSTRACT
Background: Several epidemiologic studies found no effect of
egg consumption on the risk of coronary heart disease. It is pos-
sible that the adverse effect of eggs on LDL-cholesterol is offset
by their favorable effect on HDL cholesterol.
Objective: The objective was to review the effect of dietary cho-
lesterol on the ratio of total to HDL cholesterol.
Design: Studies  were  identified  by  MEDLINE  and  Biological
Abstracts  searches  (from  1974  to  June  1999)  and  by  reviewing
reference lists. In addition, we included data from a more recently
published study. Studies were included if they had a crossover or
parallel design with a control group, if the experimental diets dif-
fered only in the amount of dietary cholesterol or number of eggs
and  were  fed  for ≥ 14  d, and  if  HDL-cholesterol  concentrations
were reported. Of the 222 studies identified, 17 studies involving
556 subjects met these criteria.
Results: The addition of 100 mg dietary cholesterol/d increased
the  ratio  of  total  to  HDL  cholesterol  by  0.020  units  (95%  CI:
0.010, 0.030), total cholesterol concentrations by 0.056 mmol/L
(2.2 mg/dL) (95% CI: 0.046, 0.065 mmol/L; 1.8, 2.5 mg/dL), and
HDL-cholesterol concentrations by 0.008 mmol/L (0.3 mg/dL)
(95% CI: 0.005, 0.010 mmol/L; 0.2, 0.4 mg/dL).
Conclusions: Dietary cholesterol raises the ratio of total to HDL
cholesterol and, therefore, adversely affects the cholesterol pro-
file.  The  advice  to  limit  cholesterol  intake  by  reducing  con-
sumption of eggs and other cholesterol-rich foods may therefore
still be valid.

INTRODUCTION

One of the dietary recommendations in the prevention of coro-
nary heart disease is to limit egg consumption (1) because eggs
have been shown to be a major source of dietary cholesterol (2).
Dietary  cholesterol  increases  serum  total  and  LDL-cholesterol
concentrations (3–7), which are established risk factors for coro-
nary  heart  disease  (8);  however, several  epidemiologic  studies
found no relation between egg consumption and risk of coronary
heart disease (9, 10). The absence of such a relation may imply
that the recommendation of lowering egg consumption is of little
use in the prevention of coronary heart disease. One egg contains
⬇200 mg/cholesterol. Although it is obvious that dietary choles-

terol  increases  total  cholesterol  concentrations  (3, 6, 7), several
studies  showed  that  dietary  cholesterol  increases  not  only  con-
centrations  of  LDL  cholesterol  but  also  concentrations  of  HDL
cholesterol (3, 6). Because HDL cholesterol may protect against
coronary heart disease, the adverse effects of egg consumption on
total and LDL-cholesterol concentrations might be attenuated by
the favorable effects on HDL-cholesterol concentrations.

The  ratio  of  total  to  HDL  cholesterol  involves  the  opposing
effects of LDL and HDL cholesterol on coronary heart disease
risk. As a result, the ratio is a better predictor of coronary heart
disease risk than are individual lipoprotein concentrations (8, 11,
12). Therefore, it may be more appropriate to study the effect of
dietary cholesterol on the ratio of total to HDL cholesterol than
on individual lipoprotein concentrations.

We  reviewed  well-controlled  studies  to  study  the  effect  of
dietary cholesterol from egg intake on the ratio of total to HDL-
cholesterol  concentrations  in  humans.  We  added  data  from  an
unpublished study of our own.

METHODS

Selection of studies

We  screened  MEDLINE  (National  Library  of  Medicine,
Bethesda, MD)  from  1974  through  June  1999  and  Biological
Abstracts from 1989 through June 1999 for experimental studies
on the effects of dietary cholesterol and eggs on total cholesterol
and  lipoproteins.  We  did  not  screen  MEDLINE  before  1974
because measurements of HDL cholesterol, which were part of
our main outcome measure, were not available at that time. For
the literature searches, the key words egg, eggs, and dietary cho-
lesterol were  each  intersected  with  the  words  serum  (plasma)
lipoprotein, serum (plasma)  cholesterol, HDL, and  LDL.  We
found  1190  citations  in  MEDLINE  and  883  in  Biological

Abstracts. In addition, we checked the reference lists of several
meta-analyses (3, 6, 7, 13, 14) and selected studies. A scan of the
titles led to the selection of 221 citations. The abstracts of these
citations  were  examined  for  compliance  with  the  following
inclusion criteria: 1) studies had to be published in English; 2)
within a study, the composition of the experimental diets could
differ only by the amount of cholesterol or the amount of eggs;
3) subjects had to be weight stable throughout the study; 4) the
design had to eliminate the effect of nonspecific drifts of the out-
come variable with time, which have been accomplished either
by feeding different groups of volunteers different diets side by
side (parallel design) or feeding each volunteer several diets in
random  order  (crossover  or  Latin-square  design);  5)  feeding
periods had to be ≥ 14 d to attain equilibrium in concentrations
of total cholesterol and lipoproteins; and 6) studies had to report
fasting concentrations of total cholesterol and lipoproteins. Stud-
ies with before-and-after designs or linear designs without a con-
trol group were excluded.

Of  the  221  articles  passing  the  title  scan, 56  passed  the
abstract scan. Because most of the 56 abstracts did not provide

sufficient  information  on  the  basis  of  our  selection  criteria, we
checked the full text of these articles. Sixteen of the 56 articles
(28%)  met  the  inclusion  criteria  (15–30).  Most  other  studies
were  not  selected  because  they  did  not  provide  information  on
HDL-cholesterol concentrations or had a linear design without a
control group. In addition to the data of these 16 studies, we used
data from our own recent study on the response to egg yolk cho-
lesterol as a function of the apolipoprotein A4 1/2 polymorphism
(31) (Table 1).

The  17  selected  studies  yielded  24  dietary  comparisons  and
5 control treatments. The studies included 422 men and 134 women.
Ten studies were conducted with men only, 6 included both men
and women, and 1 included only women. No studies reported the
race of the subjects. The age of the volunteers ranged from 18 to
75 y, mean body mass index (in kg/m2) ranged from 20.8 to 28,
and mean baseline cholesterol concentration ranged from 4.06 to
5.92 mmol/L (157 to 229 mg/dL). Not all studies reported mean
body mass index (15, 17–19, 22, 28) or baseline cholesterol con-
centration (22, 23, 27, 30). There were 11 metabolic ward stud-
ies, in which all food was provided; 5 of these studies were of

free-living  subjects  who  were  provided  eggs, high  cholesterol
products, or  egg-free  substitutes.  The  change  in  cholesterol
intake ranged from 137 to 897 mg/d. Values for total, LDL-, and
HDL-cholesterol  plasma  concentrations  were  multiplied  by
1.029 to convert to serum values (32).

Statistical analysis

We subtracted the mean concentration of serum cholesterol at
the  end  of  the  low-cholesterol  diet  from  that  at  the  end  of  the
high-cholesterol  diet  to  calculate  the  change  in  serum  choles-
terol. Six studies reported the means of individual ratios of total
to HDL cholesterol (17, 20, 22, 26, 31, 33) and 4 studies reported
the means of the individual ratios of HDL- to LDL-cholesterol
concentrations  (17, 22, 29, 31). Therefore, we  used  mean  con-
centrations of total, LDL, and HDL cholesterol at the end of each
diet to estimate the mean ratios of total to HDL- cholesterol and
of HDL- to LDL-cholesterol concentrations. Ratios have larger
variation than do individual cholesterol and lipoprotein concen-
trations. According to the Taylor approximation, this procedure
to calculate the ratios causes an underestimation of the true ratio.
The size of the underestimation is dependent on the total varia-
tion  in  the  numerator  and  denominator  and  the  correlation
between the numerator (x) and denominator (y) as follows:
E(x/y) ≈ {E(x)/E(y) ⫻ (1 + CVy ⫻ [CVy – Corr (x,y) ⫻ CVx])}
(1)

where E(x/y) is the expected mean value of x/y, E(x) is the expected
mean  value  of  x,E(y)  is  the  expected  mean  value  of  y, and  Corr
(x,y) is the correlation between x and y (34). From an independent
and large set of data (35), we calculated the CV’s of total choles-
terol (0.21), HDL cholesterol (0.22), and LDL cholesterol (0.25),
and the correlation coefﬁcients of HDL cholesterol with total cho-
lesterol (0.194) and with LDL cholesterol (0.195). Therefore, the
ratio  of  mean  total  cholesterol  to  mean  HDL  cholesterol  that  we
used was ⬇4% lower than the mean of the individual ratios. Simi-
larly, the ratio of mean HDL to mean LDL cholesterol was ⬇7%
lower. We assumed that the underestimation varied at random by
treatment and study. This implies that ratio changes in the present
study are marginally smaller than those obtained when the mean
change in individual ratios were used. We did not adjust the ratios
and their changes for this minute underestimation.

For  studies  with  a  crossover  or  Latin-square  design,

the
observed changes could be attributed fully to the change in dietary
cholesterol  or  egg  consumption  because  the  study  design  elimi-
nates  drift  of  variables  over  time.  For  studies  with  a  parallel
design, we  adjusted  for  the  drift  of  variables  over  time  by  sub-
tracting  the  changes  in  total  cholesterol  and  lipoproteins  in  the
control group from those in the treatment group. For instance, with
a 563-mg/d increase in cholesterol intake in one study, total cho-
lesterol concentrations increased by 0.27 mmol/L (10.4 mg/dL) in
the treatment group and by 0.15 mmol/L (5.8 mg/dL) in the con-
trol group (16). We subtracted the 0.15 mmol/L (5.8 mg/dL) from
the 0.27 mmol/L (10.4 mg/dL) to obtain the actual increase in the
treatment group, which was 0.12 mmol/L (4.6 mg/dL).

Regression analysis

We  used  linear  regression  models  (General  Linear  Models
procedure; 36) to study the effect of dietary cholesterol on total
cholesterol  and  lipoproteins. We  did  not  use  nonlinear  regres-
sion models because the number of studies in our data set was
limited. Furthermore, the present analysis was of only 3 studies

(17, 22, 23)  involving  subjects  with  a  cholesterol  intake  just
> 1000  mg  dietary  cholesterol/d, whereas  the  relation  between
cholesterol intake and cholesterol concentrations appears linear
when  cholesterol  intake  is ≤ 1000  mg  dietary  cholesterol/d  (7).
We  applied  several  linear  models.  In  one  model, the  change  in
total  cholesterol  and  lipoproteins  (mmol/L)  was  expressed  as  a
function  of  the  absolute  change  in  dietary  cholesterol  in  mg/d.
Regression lines were forced through the origin because a zero
change  in  cholesterol  intake  will  by  definition  produce  no
change  in  lipoprotein  cholesterol  concentrations  attributable  to
dietary cholesterol. Thus, we applied the model described below.

Change in serum cholesterol = ␤ ⫻ (change in 

dietary cholesterol)

(2)

where  the  change  in  serum  cholesterol  is  expressed  in  mmol/L
for  concentrations  and  in  dimensionless  units  for  ratios.  The
change  in  dietary  cholesterol  is  expressed  in  units  of  100  mg
dietary cholesterol/d.

We  also  expressed  dietary  cholesterol  in  mg/MJ  (1  MJ  =
238 kcal). For these analyses, we excluded 4 studies that did not
provide data on energy intake (16, 20, 22, 29). There were no large
differences in average energy intake among the various studies
and  the  results  were  not  materially  altered  when  we  expressed
dietary cholesterol in mg/MJ instead of mg/d. Therefore, we only
report the effects of a change in dietary cholesterol in mg/d.

Although studies were selected on the basis of the design and
duration of treatments, there were still considerable differences
among  the  studies.  The  number  of  subjects  per  study  ranged
from 9 to 131. To account for this, it is common in meta-analyses
to weigh each study by the reciprocal of the squared SE. How-
ever, the SEs of the changes in cholesterol and lipoprotein con-
centrations  were  not  reported  in  some  studies.  We  therefore
weighed  each  study  by  the  number  of  subjects, which  is
inversely  proportional  to  the  squared  SE.  Further, the  ratio  of
polyunsaturated  to  saturated  fat  of  the  background  diet  varied
among studies. A high ratio of polyunsaturated to saturated fat,
which is an indicator of a background diet relatively low in sat-
urated fat, may attenuate the change in total cholesterol after an
increase in dietary cholesterol (7, 37, 38). In additional analyses
we checked whether the ratio of polyunsaturated to saturated fat
affected the relation of dietary cholesterol with total cholesterol
and  lipoproteins.  Analysis  of  the  residuals  was  performed  to
check the appropriateness of each model.

To detect publication bias, we explored heterogeneity in fun-
nel  plots  visually.  Hereto, we  plotted  the  response  of  serum
lipids to 100 mg dietary cholesterol against the sample size by
study. In the absence of bias, the plots will resemble a symmet-
rical inverted funnel, as results of small studies will scatter at the
left side of the plot with the spread narrowing among larger stud-
ies on the right side of the plot (39).

RESULTS

All 17 studies reported values for total and HDL cholesterol,
but 2 studies did not report values for LDL cholesterol (Table 1;
16, 21).  Most  studies  presented  comparisons  of  2  diets, but
4 studies presented comparisons of 3 or 4 diets (15, 21, 24, 25).
In 2 studies, various groups of subjects were studied side by side.
In  one  study, diabetics  were  compared  with  healthy  subjects
(29), whereas in another study hyperlipemic subjects were com-
pared with subjects with familial-combined hyperlipemia (30).

WEGGEMANS ET AL

DISCUSSION

Our meta-analysis of 17 trials showed that dietary cholesterol
increased  the  ratio  of  total  to  HDL-cholesterol  concentrations.
The effect was highly significant (P < 0.0009) and the 95% CI
was narrow. This suggests that the favorable rise in HDL choles-
terol with increased cholesterol intake fails to compensate for the
adverse  rise  in  total  and  LDL-cholesterol  concentrations  and,
therefore, that increased intake of dietary cholesterol may raise
the  risk  of  coronary  heart  disease.  Our  meta-analysis  included
men  and  women  with  a  wide  age  range  from  North  America
(15–20, 22–25, 28, 30), Europe  (26, 27, 29, 31), and  South
Africa  (21).  The  narrow  CIs  (Table  2)  indicate  that, although
only 24 points were assessed, the effect of dietary cholesterol on
serum  cholesterol  and  lipoproteins  was  repeatable  in  different
studies and populations. The consistency of the findings among
studies suggests that our conclusions are valid for much of the
white populations of affluent countries. However, the absence of
data on the race of subjects does not allow for a confident extrap-
olation to other populations.

In  the  present  study, we  used  a  regression  model  without  an
intercept because no change in cholesterol intake will by defini-
tion  produce  no  change  in  the  serum  cholesterol  concentration
that could be attributed to dietary cholesterol. However, in those
studies that alter the intake of eggs, the intake of dietary choles-
terol, and of other egg components that may affect the serum cho-
lesterol concentration, such as fat and lecithin, is changed. These
factors may also affect concentrations of serum cholesterol and,
thus, for such studies it may not be valid to force the regression
line through the origin. To check this, we performed an analysis
excluding studies that altered the intake of eggs (16, 18, 21, 28)
or did not report whether the change in fat intake was adjusted for
in  the  control  diet  (22, 26).  This  did  not  materially  alter  the
results and thus we included these studies in our analysis.

Stratification  of  the  studies  for  study  design  (crossover  or
Latin-square  compared  with  parallel), setting  (metabolic  ward
compared  with  free-living), or  adjustment  of  the  change  in
dietary cholesterol for energy intake did not materially alter the
results. A high polyunsaturated-to-saturated fat ratio, indicating
a background diet relatively low in saturated fat, attenuated the
change in LDL-cholesterol concentration induced by an increase
in dietary cholesterol. Some other studies also found that a back-
ground diet low in saturated fat attenuated the effect of dietary
cholesterol on serum total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol con-
centration (37, 38, 58), whereas other studies did not (15, 33, 44,
52, 59–61).  In  some  of  the  latter  studies  the  change  in  dietary
cholesterol might have been too small to show an effect of the fat
composition of the background diet on the change in serum cho-
lesterol  concentration.  The  polyunsaturated-to-saturated  fat

The ratio of total to HDL cholesterol and the concentrations of

the studies, whereas HDL cholesterol concentrations increased in
19  of  the  24  dietary  comparisons.  The  ratio  of  HDL-  to  LDL-
cholesterol concentrations decreased in all but one of the studies.
If  we  assume  that  one  egg  contains  200  mg/cholesterol  (2),
consuming  one  additional  egg  daily  will  increase  the  ratio  of
total to HDL cholesterol by 0.041 ± 0.011 units (x– ± SEE), total
cholesterol  by  0.111 ± 0.010  mmol/L  (4.3 ± 0.4  mg/dL), LDL
cholesterol  by  0.100 ± 0.008  mmol/L  (3.9 ± 0.3  mg/dL), and
HDL  cholesterol  by  0.016 ± 0.003  mmol/L  (0.6 ± 0.1  mg/dL)
(Figure  1).  One  additional  egg  daily  will  decrease  the  ratio  of
HDL- to LDL cholesterol by 0.011 ± 0.002 units (Table 2).

We then divided the studies into 2 groups: those with a polyun-
saturated-to-saturated  fat  ratio  ≤ 0.7, indicative  of  a  background
diet relatively high in saturated fat, and those with a ratio > 0.7,
indicative of a background diet relatively low in saturated fat. The
response of LDL-cholesterol concentrations to a change in dietary
cholesterol  was  somewhat  weaker  in  the  studies  with  a  back-
ground diet low in saturated fat than in those with a background
diet high in saturated fat (Figure 2). We estimated that each addi-
tional 100 mg dietary cholesterol would increase serum LDL cho-
lesterol by 0.036 ± 0.004 mmol/L in the studies with a background
diet low in saturated fat and by 0.061 ± 0.006 mmol/L in the stud-
ies with a background high in saturated fat (P = 0.03). The fatty
acid  composition  of  the  background  diet  did  not  affect  the
response  of  HDL-cholesterol  concentrations  to  dietary  choles-
terol  or  the  ratios  of  total  to  HDL-cholesterol  or  of  HDL-  to
LDL-cholesterol concentrations.

We did not detect publication bias as indicated by the absence
of heterogeneity in funnel plots (results not shown). We checked
whether our results could also be applied to other studies. For this
purpose, we  selected  19  articles  that  reported  HDL-cholesterol
concentrations  but  had  failed  to  meet  other  inclusion  criteria,
eg, design.  These  19  studies  provided  33  dietary  comparisons
(38, 40–57). In 20 of these 33 dietary comparisons, the ratio of
total  to  HDL-cholesterol  concentrations  increased, whereas  in
the  other  13  comparisons  the  ratio  decreased  when  cholesterol
intake increased. Regression analysis showed that an increase of
100 mg dietary cholesterol/d increased the ratio of total to HDL
cholesterol by 0.014 ± 0.003 units in these studies, whereas the
ratio was increased by 0.020 units in the studies that fulfilled our
selection criteria (Figure 3).

with studies that failed to fulfill our selection criteria included
5 studies with mostly moderately hyperlipemic subjects (41, 52,
53, 55, 56). Because of the limited number of studies, we could
not analyze these studies separately. Nevertheless, the results of
these  studies  did  not  clearly  differ  from  those  in  subjects  with
normal cholesterol concentrations. Therefore, the results of the
present  meta-analysis  appear  also  to  be  applicable  to  hyper-
lipemic subjects.

Effects on total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol 
concentrations

The  estimated  change  in  total  cholesterol  was  0.056  mmol/L
(2.2 mg/dL)  for  each  100-mg/d  increase  in  dietary  cholesterol.
The  predicted  change  is  somewhat  smaller  than  the  change  of
0.064 mmol total cholesterol/L predicted by the formula of Keys
and  Parlin  (5)  assuming  a  change  in  dietary  cholesterol  from
300 to 400 mg/d and is considerably smaller than the change of
0.175 mmol total cholesterol/L predicted by the formula of Heg-
sted et al (4), but agrees well with changes estimated from more
recent meta-analyses (3, 6, 7, 14). It is suggested that a simple
linear  model  may  predict  group  mean  changes  in  LDL-choles-
terol concentrations rather well over the normal range of dietary
cholesterol intakes, as shown in Figure 1. Because diet-induced
changes  in  total  cholesterol  and  lipoproteins  vary  considerably
between individuals (42, 64, 65), our results cannot reliably pre-
dict  changes  in  total  cholesterol  and  lipoproteins  in  individual
subjects or patients.

Dietary cholesterol and risk of coronary heart disease

We  showed  that  consuming  one  additional  egg  daily  will
increase the ratio of total to HDL-cholesterol concentrations by
0.040 units, which would imply an increase in the risk of myocar-
dial infarction of 2.1% (11). The calculated increase in risk may
be small in an individual patient, but in view of the widespread
consumption of diets high in cholesterol it may be substantial at
the population level.

Of  course, these  calculations  do  not  take  into  account  the
effects  of  other  nutrients  in  eggs  that  may  be  beneficial  in  pre-
venting coronary heart disease, eg, vitamin E, folate, other B vita-
mins, and unsaturated fatty acids (2). Hu et al (10) calculated that
in the United States, eggs contribute to the intake of many nutri-
ents, such as retinol (4%), ␣-tocopherol (3%), folate (4%), other

FIGURE 3. The effect of an increase in dietary cholesterol on the ratio
of total cholesterol to HDL cholesterol in 17 studies that fulﬁlled the selec-
tion criteria (䉱) and 19 studies that did not fulﬁll our selection criteria (ⵧ).

LDL cholesterol in studies with a ratio of polyunsaturated to saturated
fat ≤ 0.7 (䉱) and > 0.7 (ⵧ).

ratio, however, does not take into account the absolute amount of
fat in a diet. Thus, a diet with 5% of energy from polyunsaturated
fat and 10% of energy from saturated fat has the same ratio as a
diet  with  10%  of  energy  from  polyunsaturated  fat  and  20%  of
energy  from  saturated  fat.  Differences  between  studies  in  the
absolute amount of fat may therefore also serve as an explana-
tion for some of the inconsistent results.

We found no publication bias in our meta-analysis by use of
funnel plots. In the studies that failed to fulfill our selection cri-
teria, the  effect  of  dietary  cholesterol  on  the  ratio  of  total  to
HDL cholesterol was somewhat smaller than in those included
in our meta-analysis. This might be due to a lack of dietary con-
trol resulting in a large error in the amount of dietary cholesterol
that was changed. This attenuates the estimated effect of dietary
cholesterol on serum cholesterol concentration toward the null
(62). However, it may also be due to the lack of adjustment for
the  change  in  fat  intake  that  is  induced  by  the  change  in  egg
consumption.  Only  3  (42, 48, 51)  of  these  19  studies  adjusted
for  the  change  in  fat  intake, whereas  11  of  the  17  studies
included in our meta-analysis accounted for the change. Never-
theless, the effect of dietary cholesterol on the ratio of total to
HDL cholesterol in the studies that failed to fulfill our selection
criteria leaned in the same direction as the effect in our meta-
analysis. This indicates that the present results are not due to a
biased selection of the studies.

Effects in hyperlipemic subjects

Cholesterol-lowering  diets  are  usually  prescribed  to  hyper-
lipemic  subjects  with  total  cholesterol  concentrations  > 5.0
mmol/L (193 mg/dL) (63). However, the mean baseline choles-
terol concentrations of subjects in the studies that fulfilled our
selection criteria were < 5.0 mmol/L (193 mg/dL), except for 2
studies  (15, 30).  The  moderately  hyperlipemic  subjects  in  the
study  of  Chenoweth  et  al  (15)  showed  a  0.15-  or  0.20-unit
increase in the ratio of total to HDL cholesterol after an increase
in dietary cholesterol, whereas the hyperlipemic subjects in the
study of Knopp et al (30) showed a 0.22-unit decrease and the
subjects  with  familial  combined  hyperlipemia  showed  a  0.21-
unit  decrease  with  an  increase  in  dietary  cholesterol  of  437
mg/d.  In  the  latter  study, the  percentage  increase  in  the  HDL-
cholesterol concentration was larger than that in the total cho-
lesterol concentration. The opposite effect between the studies
may  have  been  a  chance  finding  due  to  the  large  day-to-day
variation in cholesterol concentrations. The additional analysis

B vitamins (≤ 3%), monounsaturated fat (3%), and linoleic acid
(2%); however, eggs contributed to 32% of total dietary choles-
terol. Thus, in view of the relatively small contribution of eggs to
the intake of nutrients that may be beneficial in preventing coro-
nary heart disease, the recommendation to limit the consumption
of eggs may still be valid for the prevention of coronary heart dis-
ease. Other major sources of dietary cholesterol are dairy fats and
meat, but  these  are  already  considered  as  increasing  the  risk  of
heart disease because of their saturated fat content.

In  conclusion, the  consumption  of  cholesterol  increases  the
ratio  of  total  to  HDL-cholesterol  concentrations, which  would
predict  increased  risk  of  coronary  heart  disease. Therefore, the
advice to limit the consumption of eggs and other foods rich in
dietary  cholesterol  may  still  be  important  in  the  prevention  of
coronary heart disease.

Epidemiology and Prevention

Red and Processed Meat Consumption and Risk of Incident

Coronary Heart Disease, Stroke, and Diabetes Mellitus

A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis

Renata Micha, RD, PhD; Sarah K. Wallace, BA; Dariush Mozaffarian, MD, DrPH

Background—Meat consumption is inconsistently associated with development of coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke,
and diabetes mellitus, limiting quantitative recommendations for consumption levels. Effects of meat intake on these
different outcomes, as well as of red versus processed meat, may also vary.

Methods and Results—We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of evidence for relationships of red
(unprocessed), processed, and total meat consumption with incident CHD, stroke, and diabetes mellitus. We searched
for any cohort study, case-control study, or randomized trial that assessed these exposures and outcomes in generally
healthy adults. Of 1598 identified abstracts, 20 studies met inclusion criteria, including 17 prospective cohorts and 3
case-control studies. All data were abstracted independently in duplicate. Random-effects generalized least squares
models for trend estimation were used to derive pooled dose-response estimates. The 20 studies included 1 218 380
individuals and 23 889 CHD, 2280 stroke, and 10 797 diabetes mellitus cases. Red meat intake was not associated with
CHD (n⫽4 studies; relative risk per 100-g serving per day⫽1.00; 95% confidence interval, 0.81 to 1.23; P for
heterogeneity⫽0.36) or diabetes mellitus (n⫽5; relative risk⫽1.16; 95% confidence interval, 0.92 to 1.46; P⫽0.25).
Conversely, processed meat intake was associated with 42% higher risk of CHD (n⫽5; relative risk per 50-g serving
per day⫽1.42; 95% confidence interval, 1.07 to 1.89; P⫽0.04) and 19% higher risk of diabetes mellitus (n⫽7; relative
risk⫽1.19; 95% confidence interval, 1.11 to 1.27; P⬍0.001). Associations were intermediate for total meat intake.
Consumption of red and processed meat were not associated with stroke, but only 3 studies evaluated these relationships.
Conclusions—Consumption of processed meats, but not red meats, is associated with higher incidence of CHD and
diabetes mellitus. These results highlight the need for better understanding of potential mechanisms of effects and for
particular focus on processed meats for dietary and policy recommendations. (Circulation. 2010;121:2271-2283.)

Key Words: cardiovascular diseases 䡲 diabetes mellitus 䡲 diet 䡲 meat 䡲 meta-analysis

The 2005 US Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend

that consumption of red and processed meat should be
moderated.1 Such recommendations are in large part derived
from expected effects of saturated fat in meat on low-density
lipoprotein and total cholesterol levels. However, relationships
of meat consumption with disease end points such as coronary
heart disease (CHD), stroke, and type 2 diabetes mellitus are not
well established, with considerably conflicting results in prior
studies.2–19 Thus, sufficient evidence for direct relationships with
chronic cardiometabolic diseases has been lacking to support
more quantitative recommendations about specific consumption
levels of meats or potential differences between unprocessed red
meat (referred to hereafter as simply “red meat”) versus pro-
cessed meats.

Clinical Perspective on p 2283

Red versus processed meats may have some important nutri-
tional differences, such as in contents of calories, specific fats,

sodium, iron, or additives (eg, nitrites), or differences in their
preparation methods (eg, high-temperature commercial cooking)
that could produce differing effects on cardiometabolic risk.
However, potential differences in effects of red meat versus
processed meat consumption on risk of CHD, stroke, or diabetes
mellitus have not been systematically evaluated. In the United
States alone, 1 700 000 new cases of diabetes mellitus,20
600 000 myocardial infarctions, and 780 000 new or recurrent
strokes occur each year.21 Documenting and quantifying the
effects of meat consumption on these outcomes, as well as
potential differences in effects of red versus processed meat, are
of great scientific and public health importance. To address these
important questions and elucidate the conflicting results of prior
studies, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of
the evidence for relationships of red meat, processed meat, and
red and processed meat combined (referred to hereafter as “total
meat”) consumption with risk of CHD, stroke, and diabetes
mellitus.

Methods

Search Strategy
We followed Meta-Analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology22
protocols throughout the design, implementation, analysis, and reporting.
We searched for all prospective or case-control studies or randomized
controlled trials that provided effect estimates for potential associations
of red, processed, or total meat consumption and incidence of CHD,
stroke, total cardiovascular disease (CVD), or diabetes mellitus in
adults. Searches were performed with the use of MEDLINE (see
Methods in the online-only Data Supplement), EMBASE, AGRIS,
AMED, HMIC, PsycINFO, Cochrane Library, Web of Knowledge,
CABI, CINAHL, conference abstracts (ZETOC), Faculty of 1000, gray
literature sources (SIGLE), related articles, hand-searching of reference
lists, and direct author contact. Key words were meat, meat products,
beef, ham, other specific unprocessed red and processed meat subtypes,
cardiovascular diseases, and diabetes mellitus, including the earliest
available online indexing year through March 2009 without language
restrictions. “Red meat” was defined as unprocessed meat from beef,
hamburgers, lamb, pork, or game and excluding poultry, fish, or eggs23;
“processed meat” was defined as any meat preserved by smoking,
curing, or salting or addition of chemical preservatives, such as bacon,
salami, sausages, hot dogs, or processed deli or luncheon meats, and
excluding fish or eggs24; and “total meat” was defined as the total of
these 2 categories. Processed meat was primarily processed red meat,
although in some studies deli meats, a subcategory of processed meats,
may also have included some processed poultry meats that could not be
separately excluded. We excluded a priori studies focused on comparing
only vegetarians versus nonvegetarians because such comparisons could
likely be strongly modified or biased by other differences in diet and
lifestyle behaviors in vegetarians. We also recognized that the lowest
intake category in each of the included studies would include a subset of
individuals (including likely at least some vegetarians) consuming no
red or processed meat. Thus, such individuals were captured in the
included studies but without the higher potential for bias when analyses
were restricted only to special vegetarian populations. We also excluded
a priori cross-sectional or ecological studies; commentaries, general
reviews, or case reports; and studies reporting only crude risk estimates.
Selection of Articles
Of 1598 identified articles, 1505 were excluded on the basis of review
of the title and abstract (Figure 1). Full texts of the 95 remaining
manuscripts were independently assessed in duplicate by 2 investigators

if necessary, group consultation among all

to determine inclusion/exclusion, with differences resolved by consen-
sus or,
investigators.
Seventy-five studies were excluded because they were reviews (n⫽16),
cross-sectional (n⫽7), ecological (n⫽2), conducted in vegetarians
(n⫽10), or repeated publications from the same study (n⫽6); assessed
only overall dietary patterns (n⫽19), only iron intake (n⫽2), or only
animal protein/fat (n⫽1); included poultry in the meat definition
(n⫽7); did not assess incident CHD, stroke, or diabetes mellitus
(n⫽3); reported only crude risk estimates (n⫽1); or included
participants with prevalent disease (n⫽1) (see Methods in the
online-only Data Supplement). Initial inclusion/exclusion adjudica-
tions were 97% concordant. For 29 studies, authors were contacted
to request missing data or clarify meat definitions used; sufficient
responses were received for 23 of 29 studies to characterize the
exposure or missing data. For example, several articles initially
appeared to report findings separately for red meat versus processed
meat but on detailed review or direct contact were found to have
included processed meat in the red meat category, requiring direct
contact to obtain risk estimates for unprocessed red meat alone.
Data Extraction
For each of the 20 final identified studies, data were extracted indepen-
dently and in duplicate by 2 investigators, including years the study was
performed and reported, study design, sample size, definition(s) of meat
intake and disease outcomes, study location, inclusion and exclusion
criteria, duration of follow-up, covariates adjusted for, and adjusted risk
estimates and confidence intervals (CIs). When ⬎1 multivariable model
was reported, risk estimates with the greatest control for potential
confounders were extracted. If multivariable models were reported with
and without additional adjustment for variables that could be either
confounders or intermediates (eg, high cholesterol), the multivariable
model without such variables was selected. If the only multivariable
model included such variables, this was selected in preference to crude
or minimally adjusted models. Accepted standardized quality scores for
observational studies are not available. Therefore, quality assessment
was performed by evaluating and scoring 5 design criteria on an integer
scale (0 or 1, with 1 being better), including appropriateness and
reporting of inclusion and exclusion criteria, assessment of exposure,
assessment of outcome, control of confounding, and evidence of bias.
These scores were summed; quality scores from 0 to 3 were considered
lower quality, and scores of 4 to 5 were considered higher quality.
Differences in data extracted or quality assessment scores between
investigators were unusual and were resolved by consensus. Missing

data or definitions were resolved by direct contact with authors as
described above. To provide some perspective in regard to why
cardiometabolic effects of red versus processed meats might differ, we
evaluated nationally representative average nutrient and preservative
contents of red and processed meats consumed in the United States. To
estimate average nutrient qualities, we analyzed data from the 2005–
2006 US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES), accounting for NHANES sampling and weighting strate-
gies to provide nationally representative estimates25,26 (see Methods in
the online-only Data Supplement). Foods consumed in this US survey
were grouped to match the definitions of our meta-analysis for red and
processed meat. Preservative contents were obtained from a recent
report of published nitrate, nitrite, and nitrosamine contents of foods
commonly consumed in the United States26 and applied directly to
meats in the NHANES database with the use of methods similar to those

used for nutrients. We recognized that such nutrient data may not be
fully generalizable outside the United States, but comparable data were
not available from Europe, Asia, or Australia.
Statistical Analysis
All included studies were observational and reported either relative risks
(RRs; prospective cohorts) or odds ratios (case-control studies) across
several different categories of meat intake. Odds ratios were assumed to
approximate RRs24; we also performed analyses limited to prospective
cohorts only. The midpoint in each category was used to define median
intake in that category, with standardization across studies to a serving
size of 100 g (3.5 oz) for red and total meat and 50 g (1.8 oz) for
processed meat. For studies with an open-ended highest category that
did not report median intake, we assumed that the difference from the
lowest range to the median was equivalent to the same difference in the

closest adjacent category. To maximize use of the data to calculate
pooled dose response, summary estimates of log-linear dose-response
regressions were made with the use of random-effects generalized least
squares models for trend estimation27 (GLST in STATA [StataCorp,
College Station, Tex]). This method is ideal for meta-analyses of studies
having multiple risk estimates per study because it accounts for
appropriate variance-covariance relationships between and within stud-
ies. Covariance was fit with the use of total numbers of cases and of
subjects (controls plus cases) for case-control data or person-years for
cohort data, at each level of exposure. Evidence for statistical hetero-
geneity between studies was tested with goodness of fit (␹2). General-
ized least squares models for trend take advantage of the multiple data
points in all studies simultaneously to provide the best overall pooled
estimate of dose response in a single (1-stage) estimation. To construct
funnel plots and evaluate the Begg adjusted-rank correlation test for

publication bias,28 explore potential sources of heterogeneity, and
visually display the individual study results in Forest plots, we also
performed 2-stage estimation: Separate generalized least squares models
for trend were evaluated for each study to derive study-specific
log-linear dose responses (log RR), and then each study-specific log RR
was pooled in a second generalized least squares model for trend. Our
prespecified primary outcome was based on the 1-stage estimation that
better estimates the variance-covariance matrix by using all available ␤
coefficients in each study rather than the 2-stage estimation that first
derives a single ␤coefficient per study and then estimates the variance-
covariance matrix. We performed sensitivity analyses, when data were
available, for subgroups of specific processed meats. Prespecified
potential sources of heterogeneity explored were study location (United
States, Asia/Australia, Europe), degree of covariate adjustment (mini-
mal, sociodemographics; adequate, sociodemographics plus either other

mellitus were identified. Reported categories of meat con-
sumption typically ranged from never or less than once a
month (lowest category of intake) to variable highest catego-
ries of
intake. Averaged across studies, consumption
(mean⫾SD) levels in the lowest versus highest category of
intake were 1.1⫾1.1 versus 8.3⫾2.7 servings per week for
red, 0.4⫾0.8 versus 5.7⫾3.9 servings per week for processed,
and 1.8⫾1.7 versus 10.5⫾4.2 servings per week for total
meat intake, respectively. Most studies used validated multi-
item food frequency questionnaires to quantify meat con-
sumption; some used interview-based5,10,29 or fewer-item
food frequency2 questionnaires. Total numbers of participants
(n⫽342 to 322 263) and events (n⫽51 to 14 221) varied
widely between studies. Extent of covariate adjustment also
varied, especially for dietary variables that were often not
controlled for3,4,6,8,13,17 (and J. Kro¨ger, MSc, unpublished
data, 2009). Approximately half of the studies included
variables that could be confounders or intermediates (eg, lipid
levels) in addition to sociodemographic and/or dietary vari-
ables.5,7,9,10,13,15,17,29 Four studies reported how red versus
processed meat intake was associated with other dietary and
lifestyle factors at baseline.7,16,18 Relationships with these
other risk factors were similar for red versus processed meat.
For example, higher consumption of both red and processed
meat tended to be similarly associated with current smoking,
higher body mass index, family history of diabetes mellitus,
hypertension, higher education and income level, and higher
intake of total energy, total fat, saturated, monounsaturated,
and polyunsaturated fats, dietary cholesterol, and protein. In
addition, red and processed meat consumption levels were
similarly associated with less physical activity, multivitamin
use, prevalence of high cholesterol, glycemic load, and intake
of carbohydrate, fiber, and magnesium. For all but 3 of the
studies,4,10,12 the reported exposure-outcome assessment was
a prespecified primary or secondary aim.

Meat Intake and CHD
Nine studies provided 16 separate estimates for relationships
of consumption of red, processed, or total meat and incident
CHD (Figure 2).
Red Meat
Consumption of red meat was not associated with CHD
(RR⫽1.00 per serving per day; 95% CI, 0.81 to 1.23), with no
statistically significant between-study heterogeneity (P⫽0.36)

(Figure 2, top panel). Findings were similar in analyses restricted
to cohort studies2,4,5 (RR⫽0.92; 95% CI, 0.74 to 1.15) or studies
for which this exposure-outcome assessment was prespeci-
fied2,5,6 (RR⫽0.95; 95% CI, 0.66 to 1.35).
Processed Meat
Each serving per day of processed meat was associated with
42% higher risk of CHD (RR⫽1.42; 95% CI, 1.07 to 1.89)
(Figure 2, middle panel). Statistical between-study heterogeneity
was present (P⫽0.04), not accounted for by any of our prespeci-
fied sources of heterogeneity. For all included studies, this
exposure-outcome assessment was prespecified. Restricting the
analysis to cohort studies2,3,5,7 resulted in similar findings, with
44% higher CHD risk per serving per day (RR⫽1.44; 95% CI,
1.07 to 1.95). Restricting the analysis to US studies3,7 resulted in
similar findings (RR⫽1.40; 95% CI, 1.03 to 1.91). With the
exclusion of 1 large US study that evaluated only total CVD
mortality3 (not CHD alone), each serving per day of processed
meat consumption was associated with nearly 2-fold higher risk
of CHD (RR⫽1.90; 95% CI, 1.00 to 3.62), with no evidence for
between-study heterogeneity (P⫽0.29).
Total Meat
Total meat consumption was associated with a trend toward
higher CHD risk (RR⫽1.27; 95% CI, 0.94 to 1.72) (Figure 2,
bottom panel). Between-study heterogeneity was present
(P⫽0.002), observed to be due to extreme findings in the
smallest study,9 which was also the only case-control study.
With the exclusion of this study, total meat consumption was
associated with 25% higher CHD risk (RR⫽1.25; 95% CI,
1.21 to 1.29). These findings were largely driven by 1 study
that assessed only total CVD mortality3 (not CHD alone);
with the exclusion of this study, a significant association was
not confirmed between total meat
intake and CHD risk
(RR⫽1.96; 95% CI, 0.67 to 5.70), but CIs were broad.
Findings restricted to studies3,7,9 with prespecified aims to
assess this exposure-outcome relationship were similar to the
overall pooled estimate (RR⫽1.31; 95% CI, 0.92 to 1.85).

Meat Intake and Diabetes Mellitus
Seven studies provided 15 separate estimates for relationship
of red, processed, or total meat consumption and incidence of
diabetes mellitus (Figure 3).
Red Meat
Consumption of red meat was not significantly associated
with incident diabetes mellitus (pooled RR⫽1.16 per serving
per day; 95% CI, 0.92 to 1.46) (Figure 3,
top panel).
Statistical heterogeneity between studies was not evident
(P⫽0.25). All included studies were cohorts, for which the
exposure-outcome assessments were prespecified.
Processed Meat
Seven studies evaluated the relationship of processed meat
consumption and incident diabetes mellitus (Figure 3, middle
panel). All studies were cohorts for which this exposure-
outcome assessment was prespecified. In the overall pooled
estimate, each serving per day was associated with 19%
higher risk (RR⫽1.19; 95% CI, 1.11 to 1.27). Significant
between-study heterogeneity was present (P⬍0.001), identi-
fied in metaregression as related to study location (P⫽0.03).

Publication Bias
Evidence for publication bias was not apparent for most of
these exposure-outcome relationships on the basis of either
visual inspection of the funnel plot or by the Begg test, a
statistical analog of the visual funnel plot (Figure I in the
online-only Data Supplement), although such tests have
limited statistical power in the setting of relatively few
studies. The funnel plot suggested possible publication bias in
reporting of studies for processed meat intake and risk of
CHD; the Begg test did not achieve statistical significance
(P⫽0.57), and excluding the smallest study with the most
unbalanced results on the funnel plot5 had little effect on
results (RR⫽1.37; 95% CI, 1.05 to 1.79). The funnel plot also
suggested possible publication bias in reporting of studies for
red meat intake and diabetes mellitus risk, but the Begg test
did not achieve statistical significance (P⫽0.62); red meat

consumption was not significantly associated with diabetes
mellitus risk in the overall pooled result (Figure 3, top panel);
and excluding the 2 smallest studies with the most unbal-
anced results on the funnel plot14 (and J. Kro¨ger, MSc,
unpublished data, 2009) did not appreciably alter these results
(RR⫽1.05; 95% CI, 0.73 to 1.49).

Nutritional Qualities of Red and Processed Meats
On the basis of nationally representative data on the types and
quantities of meats consumed in the United States, both similar-
ities and differences were identified in average nutrient and/or
preservative contents of red versus processed meats (Table 2).
Per 50-g serving, processed meats contained modestly higher
calories and percent energy from fat and lower percent energy
from protein compared with 50 g of red meats. Consistent
with lower protein content, processed meats also contained
less iron. Processed meats contained relatively similar satu-
rated fat and slightly lower cholesterol, the latter perhaps
related to some processed meats being derived from pork
and/or lower-cholesterol deli meats. Relatively small differ-
ences were present
in contents of monounsaturated fat,
polyunsaturated fat, or potassium. Largest differences were
seen in levels of sodium, with processed meats containing

Discussion

Whereas meat consumption is commonly considered a risk
factor for cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, our findings
indicate that the effects and magnitudes may vary depending on
both the type of meat consumed and the outcome considered.
This first systematic review and meta-analysis of these relation-
ships, including 1 218 380 individuals from 10 countries on 4
continents with 23 889 cases of CHD, 2280 cases of stroke, and
10 797 cases of diabetes mellitus, provides the most robust and
reliable evidence to date of how unprocessed red and processed
meat consumption may influence risk of cardiometabolic dis-
eases. Consumption of processed meats was associated with
significantly higher incidence of both CHD and diabetes melli-
tus, with 42% and 19% higher risk, respectively, per 50-g
serving per day. In contrast, consumption of unprocessed red
meats was not associated with CHD and was associated with a
nonsigificant trend toward higher risk of diabetes mellitus.
Associations were intermediate for total meat intake.

Our extensive search of multiple databases and direct
contact with authors resulted in the identification of 17
prospective cohorts and 3 case-control studies; no random-

ized controlled trials were identified that evaluated effects of
red, processed, or total meat consumption on CVD or
diabetes mellitus events. This is not surprising when it is
considered that trials of such effects can be challenging and
costly to conduct, with limitations of nonblinding and non-
compliance over the long periods of time required to detect
clinical end points. In this setting, the best available evidence
is derived from long-term prospective cohorts of disease end
points such as those identified here, although such studies can
be limited by misclassification and residual confounding.
Retrospective case-control studies may have additional po-
tential limitations (eg, recall and selection bias).

Thus, each of these individual studies has potential limita-
tions, and our findings should be interpreted in that context. On
the other hand, this represents the most complete worldwide
evidence to date of the potential effects of red and processed
meat consumption on incidence of CHD, stroke, and diabetes
mellitus. We also performed multiple sensitivity analyses to
evaluate the extent to which our findings might vary depending
on underlying study design (cohort versus case-control), pres-
ence or absence of prespecified analyses, geographic region (eg,
United States versus other), overrepresentation of 1 large study,
or other identified sources of heterogeneity. Generally, findings
were consistent in each of these sensitivity analyses and similar

Based on data from the 2005–2006 US NHANES and a report of published

to the overall pooled results. Thus, although limitations of the
individual studies should not be ignored, our results provide the
best current evidence for how red, processed, and total meat
consumption relate to CHD, stroke, and diabetes mellitus and
highlight specific gaps in knowledge that are essential for policy
decisions relating to these important diet-disease relationships.
For example, our findings of different relationships of red
versus processed meat consumption with incident CHD and
diabetes mellitus events support the need to better characterize
which particular components of meats may increase cardiomet-
abolic risk. At least in the United States, where most of the
studies were performed, processed meats contain, on average,
similar saturated fat and lower cholesterol and iron compared
with red meats, suggesting that differences in these constituents
may not account for different associations with disease risk.
Other constituents may be relevant in determining health effects.
In particular, the observed substantially higher sodium and
nitrate preservative levels in processed meats could plausibly
contribute to increased CVD and diabetes mellitus risk and
account, at least in part, for the present findings. Dietary sodium
significantly increases blood pressure,30 –32 and habitual con-
sumption may also worsen arterial compliance and promote
vascular stiffness.33 Nitrates and their byproducts (eg, peroxyni-
trite) experimentally promote atherosclerosis and vascular dys-
function,34 reduce insulin secretion,35,36 and impair glucose
tolerance,36 and streptozotocin, a nitrosamine-related compound,
is a known diabetogenic compound.37 In observational studies in
children, nitrites and nitrous compounds are associated with type
1 diabetes mellitus,38,39 and nitrite concentrations in adults have
been used as a biomarker of endothelial dysfunction40 and

impaired insulin response.41 Differences in types of foods
commonly replaced when individuals consume red versus pro-
cessed meats could also partly account for their different
associations with risk.

Our study had several strengths. We reviewed multiple
databases broadly and systematically for all investigations of
meat consumption and incidence of CHD, stroke, or diabetes
mellitus, making it likely that we identified all major pub-
lished reports. Multiple authors were contacted directly and
clarified findings or provided additional data, minimizing
both misclassification and effects of publication bias. Study
inclusion/exclusion and data extraction were performed inde-
pendently and in duplicate by 2 investigators, increasing the
validity of results. Studies were identified from the United
States, Europe, Asia, and Australia, increasing generalizabil-
ity. Large numbers of disease end points were identified,
providing substantial statistical power to detect clinically
meaningful associations. We used generalized least squares
models for trend estimation, which explicitly assesses dose
response rather than simply categorical comparisons. We
carefully identified and separately evaluated red, processed,
and total meat consumption; in particular, relatively few prior
reports have separately considered unprocessed red meats.
Indeed, several key prior reports on red meat consumption
included processed meats in this category,3,7,8,19,24 limiting
inference on effects of unprocessed red meats alone. For
example, a systematic review by the World Cancer Research
Fund and American Institute for Cancer Research concluded
that both red and processed meat consumption increased
colorectal cancer24; however, red meats in several of the
included studies were the sum of unprocessed and processed
meats. Interestingly, their identified relationship of red (com-
monly total, ie, unprocessed red plus processed) meat intake
with colorectal cancer (22% higher risk per 100 g/d) was
approximately half that for processed meat alone (46% higher
risk per 100 g/d), consistent with our results that much of the
association between total meat intake and CHD and diabetes
mellitus may result from effects of processed meats.

Potential limitations should also be considered. As with all
meta-analyses, analyses were restricted to available published
and unpublished data. Most of these studies did not separately
assess extensive details about specific subcategories of deli
meats consumed. Processed meats may have included small
amounts of processed poultry, which could theoretically have
smaller effects and cause underestimation of effects of
processed red meats. We did not have data on cooking
methods that could alter health effects of red or processed
meats.42– 44 Both red and processed meats represent somewhat
heterogeneous categories, and thus our findings should be
interpreted as the average overall association rather than the
particular effect of 1 specific subtype of such meats. This
interpretation would be similar, for example, to analyses or
meta-analyses of effects of other classes of dietary factors,
such as fruits, vegetables, fish, whole grains, and alcohol. A
recent meta-analysis of relationships between meat consump-
tion and diabetes mellitus has been reported45; this study also
found higher risk with processed meat intake but included
crude (unadjusted) risk estimates and also did not separately
evaluate unprocessed red meats.

All studies were observational, and residual confounding
by imprecisely or unmeasured factors cannot be excluded. In
particular, several studies did not adjust for other dietary
habits or socioeconomic status. Thus, associations of pro-
cessed meat consumption with diabetes mellitus or CHD
could relate to generally less healthy diet or lifestyle rather
than causal effects of processed meats. Conversely, most
studies adjusted for at least several major demographic and
other risk factors; the reported potential confounding factors
related to red versus processed meat consumption were
similar, yet only the latter was related to risk; and specific
ingredients in processed meats (eg, salt, other preservatives)
provide biological plausibility for the observed relationships.
Several studies adjusted for factors that could be either
confounders or intermediates in the causal pathway, which
could potentially attenuate the observed risk estimates be-
tween meat consumption and disease risk. We standardized
all servings to 100 g for red and total meat and 50 g for
processed meat, and risks could vary when serving sizes are
lower or higher. Representative nutrient and preservative data
were available only for the United States, and such values
should be considered illustrative rather than definitive for
other countries. Too few studies were present to formally
exclude publication bias with sufficient statistical power. On
the other hand, our extensive direct contact with multiple
authors and inclusion of unpublished findings minimizes the
potential impact of publication bias. Notably, if publication
bias were present, it might cause overestimation of harmful
associations between processed meats and diabetes mellitus
or CHD (ie, identified harmful associations might more likely
be published) but would unlikely contribute to null associa-
tions between red meats and CHD or diabetes mellitus or
between meats and stroke (ie, publication bias is unlikely to
favor reporting of null associations).

Our findings demonstrate that consumption of processed
meat in particular is associated with incidence of CHD and
diabetes mellitus, highlighting the importance of separate
consideration of health effects, underlying mechanisms, and
policy implications of different types of processed versus
unprocessed meats. Our findings also identify critical gaps in
our understanding of how meat consumption influences
cardiometabolic risk, including potential effects of red meat
consumption on diabetes mellitus or CHD; of any meat
consumption on stroke risk; and of specific ingredients that
could be underlying these relationships. On the basis of our
evaluation of average nutrient and preservative contents of
red and processed meats, constituents in meats other than fats
may be especially relevant to health effects. On the basis of
this systematic review and meta-analysis of all available data,
future research should carefully distinguish between different
types of meats, and policy measures for improving cardiomet-
abolic health should focus particularly on reducing processed
meat consumption, including consideration of recommenda-
tions for specific quantitative limits. These findings are
particularly timely for current efforts to update the US
Dietary Guidelines for Americans, which are also often a
reference for other countries around the world.

CLINICAL PERSPECTIVE

US dietary-guidelines recommend “eating less” red and processed meat. For cardiovascular disease, these recommenda-
tions are based largely on expected effects on blood cholesterol of saturated fat and dietary cholesterol in meats. However,
relationships of meat intake with cardiometabolic disease outcomes, including coronary heart disease, stroke, and diabetes
mellitus, are not well established. Additionally, few studies have separately evaluated unprocessed red versus processed
meats, for which nutritional differences could produce different health effects. We systematically reviewed and pooled all
available worldwide data on relationships between meat consumption and risk of coronary heart disease, stroke, or diabetes
mellitus. Twenty studies were identified including 1 218 380 individuals from the United States, Europe, Australia, and
Asia. When all data were pooled, consumption of unprocessed red meat (eg, unprocessed meat from beef, pork, lamb) was
not associated with risk of coronary heart disease or diabetes mellitus. In contrast, each daily serving of processed meat
(eg, bacon, hot dog, salami) was associated with 42% higher coronary heart disease and 19% higher diabetes mellitus risk.
No associations were seen with stroke, but only 3 studies evaluated these relationships. When nationally representative US
data on average types of meats consumed were analyzed, unprocessed red and processed meats contained relatively similar
saturated fat and dietary cholesterol; processed meats contained much higher salt and nitrate preservatives. Our findings
suggest that unprocessed red and processed meats have differing relationships with cardiometabolic outcomes and also
suggest that differences in preservative contents, rather than fats, could at least partly account for these findings. Future
research should separately consider potential health effects and underlying mechanisms of unprocessed versus processed
meats, and current clinical and policy efforts should especially focus on reducing processed meat consumption.

ABSTRACT
Background: Although dietary recommendations have focused on
restricting saturated fat (SF) consumption to reduce cardiovascular
disease (CVD) risk, evidence from prospective studies has not supported
a strong link between total SF intake and CVD events. An understanding
of whether food sources of SF inﬂuence these relations may provide new
insights.
Objective: We investigated the association of SF consumption from
different food sources and the incidence of CVD events in a multi-
ethnic population.
Design: Participants who were 45–84 y old at baseline (n = 5209)
were followed from 2000 to 2010. Diet was assessed by using a 120-
item food-frequency questionnaire. CVD incidence (316 cases) was
assessed during follow-up visits.
Results: After adjustment for demographics, lifestyle, and dietary
confounders, a higher intake of dairy SF was associated with lower
CVD risk [HR (95% CI) for +5 g/d and +5% of energy from dairy
SF: 0.79 (0.68, 0.92) and 0.62 (0.47, 0.82), respectively]. In con-
trast, a higher intake of meat SF was associated with greater CVD
risk [HR (95% CI) for +5 g/d and a +5% of energy from meat SF:
1.26 (1.02, 1.54) and 1.48 (0.98, 2.23), respectively]. The substitu-
tion of 2% of energy from meat SF with energy from dairy SF was
associated with a 25% lower CVD risk [HR (95% CI): 0.75 (0.63,
0.91)]. No associations were observed between plant or butter SF and
CVD risk, but ranges of intakes were narrow.
Conclusion: Associations of SF with health may depend on food-
speciﬁc fatty acids or other nutrient constituents in foods that con-

tain SF, in addition to SF.

INTRODUCTION

As a key measure to prevent cardiovascular disease (CVD)5, the
US Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend a restriction of
saturated fat (SF) consumption (1). However, despite convincing
evidence that SF consumption raises plasma LDL in humans and
causes atherosclerosis in animal models (2), ﬁndings from many
prospective cohort studies have not supported any signiﬁcant
association between SF intake and risk of CVD (3, 4). A recent
meta-analysis that included 16 prospective cohort studies showed
pooled RR estimates (95% CIs) for extreme quintiles of SF intake
of 1.07 (0.96, 1.19) for coronary heart disease (CHD), 0.81 (0.62,
1.05) for stroke, and 1.00 (0.89, 1.11) for total CVD in participants
30–89 y of age (4).

The absence of an association between SF consumption and
CVD risk in these studies could partly relate to differences in the

comparison nutrient. For example, although clinical trials showed
that the replacement of SF with polyunsaturated fat reduced CHD
risk (5), evidence has suggested that a modiﬁcation of an SF-rich
diet toward a carbohydrate-rich diet, which is the most common
scenario in the United States and other populations, may have
little effect on CVD risk (6, 7). The absence of an association
could also partly relate to divergent effects of SF on different lipid
fractions. In comparison with carbohydrates, higher SF consumption
not only increases LDL but also increases HDL and decreases
triglycerides, with little net effect on the ratio of total:HDL cho-
lesterol (8), which is considered a better predictor of CHD events
than is total cholesterol or any individual lipid measurement (9–11).
In addition to these possible explanations, it is plausible that
effects of SF consumption could vary depending on its food source.
For example, red meat, which is a common source of SF, contains
dietary cholesterol and heme iron that may increase CVD risk (12,
13). Processed red meats and deli meats also contain high amounts
of sodium and other preservatives that may have unfavorable effects

on CVD risk factors (14). In contrast, dairy foods, which are a major
source of SF in most populations, are also sources of beneﬁcial
nutrients including vitamin D, potassium, phosphorus, and calcium
that might counterbalance the unfavorable physiologic effects of SF
(15, 16). Other sources of SF include certain plants and vegetable
oils that may contain other protective fatty acids and phytochemi-
cals (17–19). Each of these different food sources also contains
different proportions of speciﬁc SFAs (eg, myristic, lauric, and
stearic), which have differential effects on blood lipid and could
differentially inﬂuence CVD. However, despite these important
differences between food sources of SF, few previous studies
have evaluated how SF from different food sources relates to the
development of CVD.

To elucidate these relations, we investigated the association of
SF consumption from different food sources and the incidence of
CVD events in participants in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Ath-
erosclerosis (MESA). We hypothesized that associations with
incident CVD would be inﬂuenced by food sources that delivered
SF. Speciﬁcally, we hypothesized that meat SF would be posi-
tively associated with CVD, whereas dairy and plant SF would be
unassociated or inversely associated with CVD.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS

Study population

Aims and study design of the MESA cohort have been pre-
viously described (20). In 2000, 6814 adults aged 45–84 y who
were free of clinical CVD were recruited from the following 6
US communities: Baltimore City and County, MD; Chicago, IL;
Forsyth County, NC; New York, NY; Los Angeles County, CA;
and St Paul, MN. Cohort examinations were conducted in 2000–
2002 (baseline), 2002–2003, 2004–2005, and 2005–2007. Pro-
tocols were approved by local institutional review boards; all
participants provided written informed consent.

In this analysis, we excluded participants with daily energy
intakes ,600 or .6000 kcal/d (n = 801) and subjects with un-
reliable information (incomplete forms, too few or too many
foods reported per day, a high frequency of foods skipped, or too
many foods coded with the same frequency or serving size) (n =
577) (21). In addition, we excluded participants who did not
return for an examination after baseline (n = 35) as well as
subjects previously diagnosed with type 2 diabetes (n = 859) at
baseline because of the potential for recent dietary change to
bias measures of association.

Information on demographics, education, medication use,
physical activity, smoking, and drinking habits was self-reported at
baseline.

Dietary assessment

At the baseline examination, participants were asked to report
the average frequency of consumption of speciﬁc food items over
the previous year by using a modiﬁed-Block (22) 120-item food-
frequency questionnaire (FFQ), with modiﬁcations to include
Chinese food and beverage items (23, 24). Correlations between
total fat intake derived from the original FFQ and total fat intake
derived from the average of eight 24-h recalls were 0.66 in non-
Hispanic whites, 0.59 in African Americans, and 0.58 in Hispanics
living in rural areas (23). Correlations were slightly stronger for SF

estimates and were 0.77 in non-Hispanic whites, 0.62 in African
Americans, and 0.62 in rural Hispanics (23). Associations between
macronutrient intakes and plasma lipid concentrations were eval-
uated to test the criterion validity of the modiﬁed MESA-speciﬁc
FFQ (24).

Nutrient intakes from diet were estimated by multiplying the
frequency and serving size for each food consumed by the nu-
trient content of that food (Nutrition Data Systems for Research;
University of Minnesota). Intakes of SF from different food
sources were estimated separately by multiplying the SF content
in selected food items by the daily food-intake frequency and the
age- and sex-speciﬁc and portion-size gram weights. Subsequently,
food-speciﬁc SF intakes were estimated by summing the SF intake
from dairy, meat, butter, plant sources, and mixed animal and plant
sources (see Table S1 under “Supplemental data” in the online
issue for a detailed list of food sources). Additional questions
on consumption of low-fat foods and types of cooking fat were
taken into account when intakes were calculated. All nutrient
values were adjusted for energy intakes by using the residuals
method (25).

Ascertainment of CVD

Total CVD events comprised the incidence of myocardial
infarction, resuscitated cardiac arrest, deﬁnite and probable an-
gina, CHD death, stroke, stroke death, or other CVD or athero-
sclerotic death. CHD events were deﬁned as the incidence of
myocardial infarction, resuscitated cardiac arrest, deﬁnite and
probable angina, or CHD death. We also performed sensitivity
analyses, with the exclusion of angina, to evaluate only hard
CVD events. Information on cardiovascular incidence was
obtained through cohort examinations, follow-up calls, medical
record abstractions, or obituaries. Medical records were obtained on
98% of reported hospitalized events and 95% of outpatient pro-
cedures (26). Self-reported diagnoses and CVD-related records
(death certiﬁcates, autopsy reports, and medical records) were
reviewed by a medical endpoints committee. Deaths for subjects
with loss to follow-up were identiﬁed by contacting family
members. A standard protocol was used to classify events and
assign incident dates on the basis of records available (27, 28).

Statistical analysis

Restricted cubic spline analysis (29) showed no evidence of
a threshold or nonlinear relation between each SF source subtype
and CVD risk. Therefore, we used Cox proportional hazards to
estimate HRs and 95% CIs of food-speciﬁc SF estimates eval-
uated in quintiles and also for each 5-g SF/d difference and each
5% of total energy difference in SF intake. We also performed
similar analyses restricted to CHD events. To minimize potential
confounding, we evaluated 3 multivariable models. Model 1 was
adjusted for sex, age (y), race-ethnicity, energy intake (kcal/d),
and ﬁeld center. Model 2 included additional adjustment for
education level (less than high school, high school, or more than
high school), active leisure (walking, sport, and conditioning in
metabolic min/wk), sedentary leisure (television viewing, read-
ing, and light sitting activities in metabolic min/wk), alcohol in-
take (ethanol g/d), smoking (never, former, or current smoker and
number of pack-years of cigarette smoking), BMI (in kg/m2), die-
tary supplement use (at least weekly; yes or no), and cholesterol-

lowering medication use (yes or no). Finally, model 3 included
additional adjustment for intakes of fruit and vegetables (serv-
ings/d) and energy-adjusted intakes of dietary ﬁber (g/d), dietary
vitamin E (IU/d), trans fat (g/d), and PUFA (g/d). We estimated
the effect of the substitution of SF from a speciﬁc source for the
same percentage of SF from another source by including SF
from each source expressed as energy density in model 2. Dif-
ferences between linear coefﬁcients and the corresponding co-
variance matrix were used to obtain HRs and 95% CIs (30, 31).
All analyses were performed with SAS 9.2 software (SAS In-
stitute). All P values were 2-sided, and P , 0.05 indicated statis-
tical signiﬁcance.

RESULTS

During 36,364 person-years of follow-up between 2000 and
2010, a total of 316 new cases of CVD were identiﬁed, including
231 CHD events. Dairy, mixed animal and plant items, and meat
(including red and processed meat, ﬁsh, and poultry) were the
primary sources of SF in the MESA population and accounted for
35%, 26%, and 18% of total SF intake, respectively. Correlations
between food-speciﬁc sources of SF consumption were weak and
ranged from 20.12 to 0.15 (Table 1). Correlations of each SF
source with total SF were variable from as low as 0.07 for plant
SF to as high as 0.62 for dairy SF.

In unadjusted comparisons, a higher total SF intake was asso-
ciated with generally worse cardiovascular risk factors and be-
haviors, including higher BMI, greater tobacco use, lower physical
activity, lower dietary supplement use, and lower intakes of ﬁber,
dietary vitamin E, and alcohol (Table 2). Findings were generally
similar for each of the food-speciﬁc sources of SF consumption
(data not shown).

Total SF

The mean (6SE) percentage of total energy intake from SF
was 10.2 6 3.2%. In the minimally adjusted analysis that included
age, sex, race, ﬁeld center, and energy intake, total SF was mod-
estly associated with lower risk of CVD. The association was
strengthened after adjustment for other behavioral and lifestyle
confounders (ie, education, alcohol use, smoking, dietary supple-
ment and lipid-lowering medication use, physical activity, and
BMI) and major dietary factors (ie, intakes of ﬁber, fruit and
vegetables, vitamin E, trans fat, and PUFA); the HR associated
with each 5-g/d greater intake of total SF was 0.86 (95% CI: 0.75,
0.97). Similarly, the HR of CVD associated with a 5-unit increase
in the percentage of energy from total SF was 0.71 (95% CI: 0.56,
0.89) (Table 3). Results for CHD alone were very similar (see
Table S3 under “Supplemental data” in the online issue).

vitamin E. In the fully adjusted model, each 5-g/d greater intake
was associated with 21% lower risk [HR (95% CI): 0.79 (0.68,
0.92); Table 3, model 3]. Similarly, each 5-unit increase in the
percentage of energy from dairy SF was associated with 38%
lower risk of CVD [HR (95% CI): 0.62 (0.47, 0.82); Table 3,
model 3]. Directions and magnitudes of associations were similar
when CHD was evaluated separately (see Data supplement under
“Supplemental data” in the online issue).

Meat SF

In the minimally adjusted model, meat SF intake was asso-
ciated with higher risk of CVD [HR (95% CI) of 1.31 (1.09, 1.59)
for each +5 g/d and 1.69 (1.15, 2.48) for each +5% of total energy
from meat SF (Table 3, model 1)]. Associations were partly atten-
uated after additional adjustment for other demographic, lifestyle,
and dietary factors [HR (95% CI) of 1.26 (1.02, 1.54) for each +5 g/d
and 1.48 (0.98, 2.23) for each +5% of total energy (Table 3, model
3)], which indicated upward confounding (a bias toward harm) by
these factors, as seen with dairy SF. Associations between meat SF
and risk of CHD were similar to those for total CVD (see Table S2
under “Supplemental data” in the online issue).

Butter and plant SF

No associations were observed between butter, plant, or mixed
sources of SF and total CVD or CHD risk (see Data supplement
under “Supplemental data” in the online issue).

Associations with hard CHD

In sensitivity analyses in which angina was excluded from
CVD endpoints, inverse associations of total, dairy, and plant SF
with hard CVD were somewhat stronger, whereas the positive
association of meat SF with hard CVD was slightly attenuated (data
not shown).

In the minimally adjusted model, dairy SF was not signiﬁ-
cantly associated with CVD risk (Table 3). However, after ad-
ditional adjustment for other demographic and lifestyle factors,
higher intakes of dairy SF were associated with lower CVD risk
(Table 3, model 2). Inverse associations of dairy SF with CVD
risk were further strengthened by adjustment for other dietary
habits, which indicated the presence of upward confounding (a
bias toward harm) by these factors, including the consumption of
dietary ﬁber, fruit and vegetables, PUFA, trans fat, and dietary

Risk across quintiles

When we evaluated risk across quintiles of SF consumption
from each food source, a signiﬁcant inverse association was seen
for dairy SF [HR (95% CI) for extreme quintiles: 0.56 (0.38,
0.82); P-trend = 0.01], whereas meat SF was not statistically
signiﬁcantly associated with risk [HR (95% CI) for extreme
quintiles: 1.40 (0.94, 2.08); P-trend = 0.12] (Figure 1). Butter
and plant sources of SF were not associated with CVD risk, but
ranges of SF consumption from these sources were quite narrow,

which limited our ability to detect differences in risk across
quintiles.

Isocaloric nutrient-substitution models

The substitution of 2% of energy from meat SF with a similar
amount of energy from dairy SF was associated with 25% lower
CVD risk [HR (95% CI): 0.75 (0.63, 0.91)] (Table 4). At 2000
kcal/d, this substitution would correspond to the exchange of 50
kcal or w5.5 g SF [eg, the replacement of w2 oz beef (w57 g)
or processed meat with one glass (w240 mL) of whole milk or 1
cup of regular yogurt]. The replacement of energy from meat SF
with butter or plant SF was associated with trends toward lower
CVD risk, but 95% CIs were wide and ﬁndings were not sig-
niﬁcant, which was likely due to the low estimated intake of SF
from these sources. The exchange of dairy SF with butter or

plant SF, or butter SF with plant SF, was similarly not signiﬁ-
cantly associated with CVD risk, although again, 95% CIs were
wide. When only CHD events were evaluated, results were similar
to those for total CVD (see Table S3 under “Supplemental data” in
the online issue).

Subtypes of meat and dairy sources

When we separately evaluated types of meat, higher CVD risk
was seen with intakes of SF from unprocessed meat [per +5 g/d,
model 3 HR (95% CI): 1.48 (1.12, 1.93)] but not with intake of
SF from processed meat [per +5 g/d, model 3 HR (95% CI):
1.07 (0.76, 1.49)]. However, in this cohort, the range of SF in-
take from processed meats was lower than that from unprocessed
meats (90th percentile intake: 2.9 compared with 4.1 g/d, respec-
tively), which potentially limited the detection of associations with

restricted to incident CHD. Although other studies have compared
associations of the overall consumption of dairy foods and different
types of meat with CVD, to our knowledge, this was the ﬁrst study
in which associations of the SF component from different food
sources with CVD risk were evaluated.

The observed differences in associations between food-speciﬁc
SF and CVD may explain why overall SF consumption, summed
from all sources, has not been signiﬁcantly associated with incident
CVD in numerous prospective cohort studies or in pooled analyses
of these studies (4). These previous ﬁndings and our investigation
do not raise questions about the established effects of SF con-
sumption on plasma LDL. Rather, there are other potential
explanations for our results. First, although food labels, dietary
guidelines, and criteria for health claims consider only summed
SF content and focus on LDL effects (1, 32, 33), these foods
contain different proportions of different SFAs (ie, of varying
carbon chain lengths) (Figure 2) that are known to have dif-
fering effects on various blood lipids and lipoproteins (8). For
example, medium-chain SFAs, which are more common in dairy,
raise HDL to a greater extent than does palmitic acid (SFA16:0),
which composes the majority of SF in meats, producing favorable
changes in the total cholesterol:HDL ratio compared with carbo-
hydrate (8)

Second, it is plausible that the observed differences in risk
cannot be explained by differences in SF per se but, instead, by
differences in other components of foods that are more relevant
than the SF content alone. Our analysis supports the idea that
other components of meat or dairy (eg, sodium, other fatty acids,
and other nutrients) may inﬂuence disease risk, perhaps through
lipid or non–lipid-related pathways. Consistent with the concept of
food synergy (34), our ﬁndings suggest that such other components

processed meats. An ad hoc analysis of various dairy sources
suggested that inverse associations between dairy SF and CVD may
be driven by associations for whole-fat cheese rather than for low- or
whole-fat milk (see Supplemental Figure 1 under “Supplemental
data” in the online issue). Such ad hoc ﬁndings should be in-
terpreted cautiously.

DISCUSSION

In this large multiethnic cohort, a higher intake of dairy SF was
associated with lower CVD risk. In contrast, a higher intake of
meat SF was associated with higher CVD risk. Total SF was
associated with slightly lower risk of incident CVD; this effect
was driven by dairy SF, which was the greatest contributor to total
SF consumption in this population. We observed no signiﬁcant
associations of plant or butter SF with CVD risk, but ranges of
intake of SF from these sources were narrow. Directions and
magnitudes of these ﬁndings were similar when analyses were

might interact with SF and modify its relation with CVD risk by,
for example, potentially offsetting its adverse effects (eg, other dairy
components) or, conversely, by providing little beneﬁt or even ad-
ditional adverse effects (eg, other meat components). Consequently,
health effects of the entire food rather than the content of any single
nutrient might be most relevant to understanding associations be-
tween dietary consumption and health outcomes.

Few studies have reported associations between dairy products
and CVD risk. In a recent meta-analysis that included 13,518
participants with 2283 CVD events from 4 prospective studies
conducted in several countries, the pooled RR of total CVD
associated with a 200 mL/d intake of all milk, which corresponds
to 1–4 g dairy SF/d, was 0.94 (95% CI: 0.89, 0.99) (16). Con-
versely, the evaluation of CHD by using data from 6 prospective
studies, which included w260,000 participants with 4391 CHD
events, produced a pooled RR per 200-mL/d intake of all milk of
1.00 (95% CI: 0.96, 1.04) (16). In addition, no association was
shown with total dairy intake (16). Unfortunately, only 2 of 6
studies in this meta-analysis included adjustment for potential
dietary confounders. The general associations of higher SF
consumption with a less-healthful lifestyle and diets overall,
as evidenced by our data and the data of others (35, 36), indicate
that SF and dairy consumption are likely to be confounded toward
harm by other dietary habits, in particular the consumption of ﬁ-
ber, fruit and vegetables, PUFA, and vitamin E. In the recently
published meta-analysis of milk consumption, the inverse associ-
ation with CVD was observed only when fully adjusted models
were used, which supports our explanation (16).

Dairy contains several nutrients that could help explain the
observed inverse association of dairy SF with CVD risk. Higher
concentrations of plasma trans palmitoleic acid, which is a fatty
acid shown primarily in dairy foods, have been recently asso-
ciated with higher HDL, lower triglycerides, lower C-reactive
protein, lower insulin resistance, and lower incident diabetes in
adults in the Cardiovascular Health Study (37). Other dairy nu-
trients including calcium, potassium, and phosphorus could have
antihypertensive effects that may contribute to inverse associations
with CVD risk (19, 38, 39). Consistent with the importance of
evaluating foods rather than single nutrients, it is feasible that the

on 12 June 2018

complex mixture of dairy-food constituents as a whole may be
most relevant for health effects. For example, previous studies
have shown that higher intakes of calcium and phosphorus
from dairy foods, but not from other sources, were associated with
lower blood pressure (19, 40).

Our ﬁndings for meat SF are in general agreement with
previous studies that evaluated associations between CVD and
meat intake. A recent meta-analysis that included .600,000
participants with 22,000 CHD events from 4 cohorts and one case-
control study showed total meat intake to be associated with a
trend toward higher CHD risk [RR (95% CI) per 100 g total
meat/d: 1.27 (0.94, 1.72)] (14). In studies that separately eval-
uated processed meats compared with unprocessed red meats,
a positive association was observed only for processed meats [RR
(95% CI) per 50 g processed meats/d: 1.42 (1.07, 1.89)] but not
unprocessed meats [RR (95% CI) per 100 g unprocessed meats/d:
1.00 (0.81, 1.23)] (14). On average, in the United States, processed
meats and unprocessed red meats have similar SF contents, which
suggests that other nutrients, such as sodium and nitrates in pro-
cessed meats, might explain these differences (14). A more recent
analysis from the Nurses’ Health Study also showed higher risk of
CHD with total meat consumption [RR (95% CI) across quintiles:
1.29 (95% CI: 1.12, 1.49)] than with unprocessed red meat con-
sumption [RR (95% CI) across quintiles: 1.13 (95% CI: 0.99,
1.30)], although associations were more similar when intakes were
evaluated continuously (30). Overall, our ﬁndings support an ad-
verse association of SF consumption from meats with CVD risk
but suggest that additional investigations are needed to conﬁrm
potential differences by types of meats and other constituents.

Our study has several strengths. We used data from a large,
multiethnic cohort study, which allowed us to investigate a greater
variety of dietary behaviors and susceptibility to CVD outcomes
than might be present in a more racially and ethnically homoge-
neous population. The prospective design allowed us to estimate the
incidence of disease with less concern for reverse causation be-
tween diet and outcomes. Finally, the evaluation of SF intake from
different food sources provide novel insights into the relation
between SF, the foods studied, and CVD.

Limitations should be considered. Potential measurement er-
rors in exposure assessment were likely, which, if random, would
have attenuated measures of association in most circumstances

(41, 42). Although we were able to adjust for a variety of major
risk factors, we cannot exclude the possibility of residual con-
founding because of unmeasured or poorly measured factors. On
the basis of the observed directions of confounding in our cohort,
residual confounding would likely have led to an overestimation
of harms of SF from meat sources and an underestimation of
beneﬁts of SF from dairy sources. The relatively low consump-
tion of SF from processed meats, butter, and plant sources may
have limited the statistical power to detect associations in this
cohort. Finally, we recognize that inferences of causality are
limited in observational studies, and results from isocaloric sub-
stitution models should be interpreted with caution.

In conclusion, we showed that associations between SF and
incident CVD depend on the food source; the consumption of
dairy SF is inversely associated with risk, and the consumption of
meat SF is positively associated with risk. Our ﬁndings raise the
possibility that associations of foods that contain SF with health
may depend on speciﬁc fatty acids present in these foods or the
complex admixture of other food constituents, in addition to SF.

Abstract

Background: Recent studies, primarily in non-Hispanic whites, suggest that dietary patterns have distinct metabolomic
signatures that may influence disease risk. However, evidence in South Asians, a group with unique dietary patterns and
a high prevalence of cardiometabolic risk, is lacking.
Objective: We investigated the metabolomic profiles associated with 2 distinct dietary patterns among a sample of
Asian Indians living in the United States. We also examined the cross-sectional associations between metabolomic
profiles and cardiometabolic risk markers.
Methods: We used cross-sectional data from 145 Asian Indians, aged 45–79 y, in the Metabolic Syndrome and
Atherosclerosis in South Asians Living in America (MASALA) pilot study. Metabolomic profiles were measured from
fasting serum samples. Usual diet was assessed by using a validated food-frequency questionnaire. We used principal
components analysis to derive dietary and metabolomic patterns. We used adjusted general linear regression models
to examine associations between dietary patterns, individual food groups, metabolite patterns, and cardiometabolic risk
markers.
Results: We observed 2 major principal components or metabolite clusters, the first comprised primarily of medium- to
long-chain acylcarnitines (metabolite pattern 1) and the second characterized by branched-chain amino acids, aromatic
amino acids, and short-chain acylcarnitines (metabolite pattern 2). A “Western/nonvegetarian” pattern was significantly
and positively associated with metabolite pattern 2 (all participants: β ± SE = 0.180 ± 0.090, P = 0.05; participants
without type 2 diabetes: β ± SE = 0.323 ± 0.090, P = 0.0005). In all participants, higher scores on metabolite pattern
2 were adversely associated with measures of glycemia (fasting insulin: β ± SE = 2.91 ± 1.29, P = 0.03; 2-h insulin:
β ± SE = 22.1 ± 10.3, P = 0.03; homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance: β ± SE = 0.94 ± 0.42, P = 0.03),
total adiponectin (β ± SE = −1.46 ± 0.47, P = 0.002), lipids (total cholesterol: β ± SE = 7.51 ± 3.45, P = 0.03; triglyc-
erides: β ± SE = 14.4 ± 6.67, P = 0.03), and a radiographic measure of hepatic fat (liver-to-spleen attenuation ratio:
β ± SE = −0.83 ± 0.42, P = 0.05).
Conclusions: Our findings suggest that a “Western/nonvegetarian” dietary pattern is associated with a metabolomic
profile that is related to an adverse cardiometabolic profile in Asian Indians. Public health efforts to reduce car-
diometabolic disease burden in this high-risk group should focus on consuming a healthy plant-based diet. J Nutr

Introduction
The human metabolome, a collection of >40,000 metabolites
or small molecules, provides a comprehensive summary of an
individual’s chemical status and reports on the interaction be-
tween a person’s genome and his or her environment. In recent
years, the field of nutritional epidemiology has rapidly evolved
by integrating metabolomic profiling with nutrition in complex
biosystems. Metabolomics, the measurement of small molecules
in biological samples, offers a unique opportunity to identify
new biomarkers of diet and to examine the complex molec-
ular mechanisms affecting disease risk (1). Diet can affect the
human metabolome by either directly contributing metabolites
or by indirectly influencing metabolic pathways that consume
or produce specific metabolic intermediates (2). It is therefore
plausible that individuals with different dietary patterns might
present with distinct metabolomic signatures that could influ-
ence disease risk. For example, few studies have shown that
individuals who consume a Western-style dietary pattern, de-
fined by high intakes of red meat, potatoes, and sweets, have
a metabolomic signature enriched with BCAAs (3) and short-
chain acylcarnitines (ACs) (3, 4). Several studies have shown
an association of a very similar metabolite cluster with obe-
sity, insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular dis-
ease (5–11). However, associations between dietary patterns and
metabolite classes related to disease risk have not been exam-
ined in a South Asian population known to have unique dietary
patterns (12) and a high prevalence of cardiometabolic risk (13–
16).

With the use of data from the Metabolic Syndrome and
Atherosclerosis in South Asians Living in America (MASALA)
pilot study, our aim was to investigate the associations between
2 dietary patterns and serum metabolomic profiles derived from
a panel of 45 ACs, 15 amino acids including BCAAs and aro-
matic amino acids, nonesterified FAs, ketones, and lactate. To
elucidate potential mechanisms by which diet may influence car-
diometabolic risk in South Asians, we further examined asso-
ciations between metabolomic profiles and biomarkers of car-
diometabolic risk in this high-risk population.

Methods
Study population. We used cross-sectional data from the MASALA
pilot population-based study. The study design and methods of the
MASALA pilot study are described in detail elsewhere (17). Briefly, the
study enrolled 150 participants, aged 45 to 79 y, who self-identified as

Asian Indians living in the San Francisco Bay Area between August 2006
and October 2007. The pilot study was modeled after the Multi-Ethnic
Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) and used similar recruitment methods,
inclusion and exclusion criteria, and study measurements. Accordingly,
we excluded participants with a physician-confirmed diagnosis of car-
diovascular disease or a history of coronary artery bypass graft surgery,
angioplasty, valve replacement, pacemaker or defibrillator implantation,
and surgery on the heart or arteries. We also excluded participants who
used nitroglycerin, those undergoing active cancer treatment, those with
impaired cognitive ability, those with a life expectancy <5 y, those living
in a nursing home, and those planning to move. Participants who could
not speak or understand Hindi or English were also excluded.

Eligible participants completed an in-person interview to ascertain
their age, sex, medical history, smoking and alcohol use, physical activ-
ity, and dietary intake. In addition, fasting blood samples were collected
by a certified phlebotomist after a 12-h fast. For the current analyses, we
excluded 4 participants who reported implausible energy intakes (<500
or >5000 kcal/d) and 1 participant with missing data on metabolites.
The present study included 145 participants with complete data at the
time of analyses. All of the study protocols were approved by the Uni-
versity of California, San Francisco, Institutional Review Board, and all
of the participants provided written informed consent.

Metabolomics analysis and metabolite patterns. Targeted
metabolomics analyses were performed on fasting serum samples at the
Stedman Center/Duke Molecular Physiology Institute Metabolomics
Core at Duke University. Concentrations of lactate, total ketones, and
nonesterified FAs were measured by standard clinical chemistry meth-
ods on a Beckman DxC600 autoanalyzer. With the use of a targeted
MS-based approach, we determined the concentrations of 45 ACs and
15 amino acids. Proteins were first removed by precipitation with
methanol. Aliquoted supernatants were dried and esterified with either
hot acidic methanol (for ACs) or n-butanol (for amino acids) (18, 19).
Analysis was done by using tandem flow injection MS with a TQD
instrument (Waters Corporation). Quantitation of the “targeted” in-
termediary metabolites was facilitated by the addition of mixtures of
known quantities of stable-isotope internal standards, as detailed pre-
viously (20). The use of internal standards enabled absolute quantita-
tion in micromolar units, and values below the practical lower limits of
quantitation were reported and analyzed as “0”.

Dietary intake. Habitual food consumption and nutrient intakes
were captured by using an ethnicity-specific semi-quantitative FFQ, de-
signed and validated among South Asians in the Study of Health As-
sessment and Risk in Ethnic Groups (SHARE) (21). The FFQ consists
of 163 items, including 61 items unique to the South Asian diet. The to-
tal quantity of consumption (servings per day) for each food item was
computed from the frequency of consumption (assessed as per day, per
week, per month, per year, or never) and the serving size (average, small,
or large). For each food item, the average serving size was provided. A
small serving size was considered to be 0.5 of the average serving size,
whereas a large serving size was 1.5 of the average. Foods were catego-
rized in 29 predefined subgroups on the basis of similarity of nutrient
content, likeness, and their culinary use in an Asian-Indian diet (12)
(Supplemental Table 1). Foods such as coffee were retained as individ-
ual categories given their high reported intake. The FFQ was previously
validated against 7-d diet records. Energy-adjusted and deattenuated
(corrected for measurement error) correlation coefficients for micronu-
trients ranged from 0.45 for total protein intake to 0.73 for intakes of
vitamin E and cholesterol (21).

Measurement of covariates. Weight was measured by using a
standard balance-beam scale, and height was measured by using a sta-
diometer. Three blood pressure measurements were obtained in the
seated position with the use of an automated blood pressure moni-
tor (Philips-Agilent V24C). Mean systolic and diastolic blood pressures
were computed as averages of the second and third readings. Hyperten-
sion was defined as systolic blood pressure ≥140 mm Hg or diastolic
blood pressure ≥90 mm Hg or the use of antihypertensive medication.

Biomarkers of cardiometabolic risk. Fasting plasma glucose
was measured by using a glucose oxidase method (YSI 2300 STAT
Plus; YSI Life Sciences). Total adiponectin and fasting insulin were mea-
sured by RIA (Linco Research, Inc.). HOMA-IR was calculated as fol-
lows: glucose (mmol/L) × insulin (mU/L)/22.5 (22). Participants were
administered 75 g oral glucose, and blood samples were obtained at
120 min for the measurement of plasma glucose and insulin. Diabetes
was defined as the use of a hypoglycemic medication or fasting plasma
glucose ≥126 mg/dL or a 2-h postchallenge glucose concentration of
≥200 mg/dL (23). Prediabetes was defined as a fasting plasma glucose
concentration of 100–125 mg/dL or a 2-h postchallenge glucose concen-
tration of 140–199 mg/dL (23). Participants with normal glucose toler-
ance had both fasting plasma glucose concentrations <100 mg/dL and
a 2-h glucose concentration <140 mg/dL. Insulin sensitivity index was
computed as 10,000/square root of (fasting glucose × fasting insulin)
× (mean glucose × mean insulin during an oral-glucose-tolerance test)
(24).

Total cholesterol, TGs, and HDL cholesterol were measured by en-
zymatic methods (Quest Diagnostics). LDL cholesterol was calculated
by using the Friedewald formula (25).Visceral fat area was measured
by using DXA (Hologic Discovery-Wi) at the L4–L5 level after par-
ticipants were placed in a supine position. We obtained nonenhanced

computed tomography (CT; Philips Medical Systems) images of liver
and spleen density to quantify hepatic fat content. The presence of fatty
liver was defined by a liver-to-spleen attenuation ratio of <1, and lower
values represent higher amounts of hepatic fat (26–28). A trained vascu-
lar technician performed a carotid ultrasound examination to quantify
maximal intimal medial thickness of the internal and common carotid
artery (17). Cardiac CT scans were performed by using a gated-cardiac
CT scanner with the use of either the 16D scanner (Philips Medical
Systems) or the MSD Aquilion 64 model (Toshiba Medical Systems).
All CT scans were read centrally at Harbor–University of California
Los Angeles Medical Center. Coronary artery calcium (CAC) Agatston
scores were reported for each of the 4 major coronary arteries, and the
summed score was used (15). For the current analysis, we modeled CAC
scores as a binary outcome (<10 compared with ≥10).
Statistical methods. We applied a log (x + 1) transformation to
the metabolite data to improve normality. We used the FACTOR proce-
dure in SAS to derive metabolomic signatures and dietary patterns. Log-
transformed metabolites were entered into principal components analy-
sis, and the varimax option was specified. Dietary patterns were derived
as previously described (12). Briefly, food groups were entered into prin-
cipal components analysis as servings per day and factors were rotated

1Values are βs ± SEs for each metabolite pattern score per 1-unit increase in the dietary pattern factor score calculated by using linear regression. Model 1 adjusted for age (years)
and sex; model 2 adjusted as for model 1 plus for smoking (never, past smoker, or current smoker), education (high school or less, less than Bachelor’s degree, Bachelor’s degree,
or more than Bachelor’s degree), BMI (kg/m2), physical activity (metabolic equivalent task hours per week), and total energy intake (kilocalories per day); model 3 adjusted as for
model 2 plus for prevalent hypertension (yes or no). AAA, aromatic amino acid; AC, acylcarnitine; MASALA, Metabolic Syndrome and Atherosclerosis in South Asians Living in
America.
2Among all participants, model 3 was additionally adjusted for prevalent diabetes status (yes or no).
3Among participants without type 2 diabetes, a vegetarian pattern was identified in the first principal component, whereas a nonvegetarian pattern was identified in the second
principal component.

orthogonally. To determine the number of factors to retain for both
metabolomics signatures and dietary patterns, we examined principal
components with Eigenvalues >1, scree plots, variance explained, factor
loadings, and overall interpretability. Metabolites or food groups with
factor loadings ≥0.5 were considered to contribute significantly to the
principal component. We used the SCORE procedure in SAS to derive a
score for each factor for each participant by summing intakes of the food
groups (or metabolomic signature groups) multiplied by their respective
factor loadings. Higher scores indicate a greater degree of conformance
to the respective principal component. Dietary pattern scores were mod-
eled as both continuous and categorical variables (<0 and ≥0).

Participants who received higher factor scores for metabolomic
pattern 1 than for metabolomic pattern 2 were categorized into
metabolomic signature 1. Likewise, those who had higher factors
scores for metabolite pattern 2 than for pattern 1 were categorized
into metabolomic signature 2. Differences in descriptive characteristics
of study participants by metabolomic signature categories were deter-
mined with the use of t tests for continuous variables and chi-square
analyses for categorical variables. We used Pearson correlations to
examine associations between dietary pattern scores and metabolite
patterns, adjusting for total energy intake. We used a general linear
regression model to examine associations between dietary pattern
scores (continuous and categorical: <0 and ≥0) and metabolite pattern
scores (continuous). In our first model, we adjusted for age and sex. In
model 2, we additionally adjusted for total energy intake, educational
status, and traditional cardiometabolic risk factors, such as smoking,
BMI, and physical activity. Because alcohol was listed as a food group in
our principal components analysis, we did not adjust for this variable.
In our final model, to account for potential reverse causation due to
the diagnosis of a cardiometabolic outcome, we further adjusted our
models for the presence of prevalent type 2 diabetes and hypertension.
In a secondary analysis, in order to understand if associations between
dietary pattern scores and metabolite patterns were driven by certain
food groups, we examined cross-sectional associations between food
groups with factor loadings ≥0.5 (continuous) and metabolite pattern
scores adjusting for the covariates listed above.

Given our previous findings that greater adherence to a Western
pattern was associated with adverse measures of glycemia and insulin
resistance (29), we examined the cross-sectional associations between
metabolite pattern scores and several biomarkers of cardiometabolic
risk with the use of linear regression. For models with CAC as a binary
outcome, we used logistic regression. In these models, in addition to

the covariates listed above, we further adjusted for medication use, in-
cluding cholesterol-lowering medications. Because the presence of type
2 diabetes can significantly alter the metabolomic profile (30, 31), we
repeated all analyses restricting to those without type 2 diabetes. For all
linear models, we checked for evidence of violations of the assumptions
of normality, linearity, and homogeneity by examining plots of residu-
als compared with predicted values and the normal probability plots of
residuals. All of the statistical analyses were conducted with the use of
SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute). A significance level of P ≤ 0.05 was used.

Results
Dietary patterns and metabolite patterns. We derived 2 ma-
jor dietary patterns: a Western/nonvegetarian pattern, charac-
terized by high intakes of poultry, fish, red meat, coffee, pizza,
and alcohol, and a vegetarian pattern, characterized by high in-
takes of rice, legumes, sugar-sweetened beverages, and snacks.
When we restricted the analyses to those without diabetes, we
observed a nonvegetarian and a vegetarian pattern. Similar to
the overall population, the nonvegetarian pattern was charac-
terized by higher intakes of red meat, poultry, and fish as well
as eggs and vegetables. Foods that loaded heavily on the vegetar-
ian pattern included rice, snacks, legumes, and sugar-containing
beverages (Supplemental Table 2). In all of the participants,
we derived 2 major metabolomic signatures. The first pattern
was enriched primarily with medium-chain (C8–C14) and long-
chain (C16 –C20) ACs and accounted for 15.9% of the vari-
ance. The second metabolite pattern was characterized primar-
ily by BCAAs and aromatic amino acids plus short-chain (C2
and C5) ACs (Supplemental Table 3). Among participants with-
out type 2 diabetes, we observed similar metabolomic signatures
(Supplemental Table 3).

Descriptive characteristics. We included data on 145 partici-
pants with complete information on diet and metabolites. In the
overall sample, half of the participants were women, and the av-
erage age was 57 y. A large majority of the participants had at
least a bachelor’s degree, a family income ≥$100,000, and were

never smokers. Participants with higher factor loadings on the
BCAA, aromatic amino acid, and short-chain AC pattern than
on the medium- to long-chain AC pattern were younger, more
likely to be male, and had a significantly higher BMI. These
participants were also more likely to have higher factor scores
on the nonvegetarian dietary pattern (Table 1).

Cross-sectional associations between dietary patterns and
metabolomic signatures. In the overall sample (n = 145),
after adjusting for age, sex, smoking status, education, BMI,
physical activity, total energy intake, and comorbidities in-
cluding type 2 diabetes and hypertension, we found a positive
association between a Western/nonvegetarian dietary pattern
and a metabolite pattern enriched with BCAAs, aromatic
amino acids, and short-chain ACs (Table 2). At the same
time, compared with those with low scores (<0) on the West-
ern/nonvegetarian dietary pattern, those with high scores (≥0)
had significantly higher adjusted mean BCAAs, aromatic amino
acids, and short-chain ACs in their metabolite pattern scores
(Table 3). When we restricted the analysis to those without
type 2 diabetes (n = 105), a nonvegetarian dietary pattern was
strongly and positively associated with BCAAs, aromatic amino
acids, and short-chain ACs. Likewise, compared with those
with low factor scores (<0) on the nonvegetarian dietary pat-
tern, those with high factor scores (≥0) had significantly higher
BCAA, aromatic amino acid, and short-chain AC metabolite
pattern scores (Table 3). In both the overall sample and among
those without type 2 diabetes, we found no significant associ-
ations between a vegetarian dietary pattern and metabolomic
signatures (P > 0.05).

Metabolite patterns and food groups. In a secondary anal-
ysis, we examined cross-sectional associations between serv-
ings of individual food groups with factor loadings ≥0.5
and metabolite patterns. In the overall sample, we found
a positive and significant association between red meat in-
take and BCAAs, aromatic amino acids, and short-chain
ACs. Among those without
type 2 diabetes, higher in-
takes of poultry, red meat, and vegetables were associated
with a BCAA, aromatic amino acid, and short-chain AC
metabolomic signature (Table 4). However, after perform-
ing Bonferroni correction (P < 0.006), only vegetables were
associated with a BCAA, aromatic amino acid, and short-
chain AC metabolomic signature. We found no association
between any of the individual food groups and the medium-
to long-chain AC metabolite pattern.
Metabolomic
car-
and
diometabolic risk. Among all participants and in those
without type 2 diabetes, we found that higher scores on the
medium- to long-chain AC pattern were associated with higher
concentrations of total adiponectin (Table 5). In the entire
sample, higher scores on the BCAA, aromatic amino acid,
and short-chain AC metabolomic pattern were significantly
associated with higher fasting insulin and 2-h insulin concen-
trations, higher insulin resistance, and lower concentrations of
total adiponectin and a lower insulin sensitivity index. At the
same time, the BCAA, aromatic amino acid, and short-chain
AC metabolomic pattern was also positively associated with
total cholesterol and TG concentrations and lower liver-to-
spleen attenuation. In analyses restricted to those without
type 2 diabetes, this metabolomic pattern was associated with
higher concentrations of fasting glucose, lower concentrations
of total adiponectin, and a lower insulin sensitivity index.

In both the overall sample and the subgroup restricted to
those without type 2 diabetes, we found no associations be-
tween metabolomic patterns, visceral fat area, and subclinical
measures of atherosclerosis.

Discussion
In this cross-sectional pilot study in middle-aged immigrant
Asian Indians living in the United States, we confirmed 2 major
dietary patterns—a Western/nonvegetarian and a vegetarian di-
etary pattern—and documented 2 major metabolomic profiles,
including one enriched with medium- to long-chain ACs and
another characterized by higher concentrations of BCAAs, aro-
matic amino acids, and short-chain (C2, C5) ACs. In both the
overall sample and in the subset of participants without type 2
diabetes, a Western or a nonvegetarian dietary pattern was pos-
itively associated with a BCAA, aromatic amino acid, and short-
chain AC metabolomic pattern. In particular, higher intakes of
red meat were positively associated with this metabolite pat-
tern. Among those without type 2 diabetes, in addition to red
meat intake, intakes of fish and vegetables were additionally as-
sociated with the BCAA, aromatic amino acid, and short-chain
AC pattern. We also found this metabolomic pattern to be sig-
nificantly and positively associated with measures of glycemia,
insulin resistance, TGs, and liver-to-spleen attenuation ratio.

A direct comparison of our findings with the existing litera-
ture is not straightforward because, to our knowledge, no pre-
vious study has examined associations between a South Asian
dietary pattern and metabolomic profiles. However, our results
are broadly consistent with studies that examined dietary
sources of metabolites and with studies that
identified a
“Western” or “meat” pattern. For example, in a cross-sectional
analysis of 210 participants, aged 18 to 50 y, recruited from the
greater Quebec City area, a Western dietary pattern defined by
higher intakes of refined-grain products, desserts, sweets, and
processed meats was positively associated with a metabolomic

signature comprised of leucine, methionine, arginine, pheny-
lalanine, proline, ornithine, histidine, and ACs C0, C3, C4, and
C5 (r = 0.38, P = 0.03) (3). In the Oxford arm of the European
Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)
study, consistent with our finding that a “nonvegetarian”
pattern was associated with short-chain ACs, Schmidt et al. (4)
found that meat and fish eaters had the highest concentrations
of tryptophan and ACs C0, C4, and C5. At the same time, fish
eaters had the highest concentrations of the BCAAs leucine and
valine and the amino acids methionine and tyrosine (4, 32), all 4
of which are essential amino acids. When examining individual
food groups, similar to our findings, several studies documented
elevated concentrations of acetylcarnitine (C2) with meat con-
sumption.
In a short-term feeding study, acetylcarnitine
concentrations were significantly elevated in 12 healthy men
after a “high-meat” diet (33). In a double-blind, randomized,
placebo-controlled dietary intervention trial in 160 participants,
a positive association between red meat intake and urinary
concentrations of O-acetylcarnitine was documented (34).
Likewise, in a recent randomized, controlled, crossover trial,
urinary concentrations of O-acetylcarnitine were significantly
higher with increases in red meat intake (35). In a case-control
study, red and processed meat intake was found to be positively
associated with urinary, but not serum, concentrations of acetyl-
carnitines (36). In a more recent analysis, 3 short-chain ACs,
including acetylcarnitine (C2), propionylcarnitine (C3), and
2-methylbutrylcarnitine (C5), were found to be generic markers
of meat and fish intake (37). Our finding of higher concentra-
tions of the ACs C2 and C5 with the “nonvegetarian” pattern
is consistent with these findings. Interestingly, C3 and C5 ACs
are generated from BCAA catabolism and have been previously
reported to be associated with obesity and insulin resistance. It
is worth noting that red meat is a major source of l-carnitine,
a trimethylamine, which could contribute to the association
of particular AC species with increased red meat and fish
consumption (38). In fact, acetylcarnitine has been reported to

be a marker for prediabetes and diabetes in previous studies
(39, 40).

Our finding of a positive association between vegetable con-
sumption and a metabolite pattern characterized by BCAAs,
aromatic amino acids, and short-chain ACs was unexpected.
Given that previous studies have found these metabolites to
be associated with higher meat consumption and because
vegetables are traditionally included in some South Asian meat
preparations, it is likely that the observed associations could
be confounded by meat intake. However, when we additionally
adjusted for red meat and poultry, the association, although
attenuated, remained significant. It may also be that the major
unhealthy components of the vegetarian pattern, such as rice,
sugar-containing beverages, and snacks, could confound this
association. It is also likely that oils and clarified butter, typi-
cally rich in saturated fats, which are added to vegetable curries
during the cooking process, could be driving this association.

Consistent with our findings, several studies have sug-
gested that BCAAs and aromatic amino acids are predictors of
insulin resistance and cardiometabolic risk (41–43). In large-
scale cohorts such as the Framingham Heart Study, the Fram-
ingham Heart Study Offspring Study, and the Insulin Resis-
tance Atherosclerosis Study, higher BCAA concentrations were

inversely associated with insulin sensitivity (43) and positively
with insulin resistance (42, 44) and fasting glucose (44) and TG
(42, 44) concentrations. However, unlike in the Framingham co-
horts (42, 44), we were unable to find an association with HDL
cholesterol. Only 3 other studies in South Asians have exam-
ined associations between metabolomic profiles and measures
of glycemia and insulin resistance (9, 45, 46). In a cohort of
nondiabetic South Asian men from the Southall and Brent Re-
visited (SABRE) study, BCAAs or aromatic amino acids were
not correlated with fasting or 2-h glucose, fasting or 2-h insulin,
and HOMA-IR. However, both BCAAs and aromatic amino
acids were strongly and adversely associated with incident di-
abetes, even after adjusting for metabolic risk factors (46). In a
small cross-sectional study in 83 Asian-Indian men in Singapore,
strong associations, independent of BMI and dietary protein,
were reported between BCAAs, aromatic amino acids, methio-
nine, and insulin resistance (9). In a third study in Indians from
South India, BCAAs and aromatic amino acids were elevated in
participants with a high BMI and type 2 diabetes and in obese,
nondiabetic participants (45).

To our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate associ-
ations between dietary patterns, metabolomic signatures, and
cardiometabolic risk in an Asian-Indian population that is a

distinctly high-risk phenotypic group. The strengths of the cur-
rent study include the availability of validated dietary data,
absolute quantitation of plasma metabolites, and a well-
phenotyped study population. Still, our results need to be inter-
preted in the context of a few limitations. First, given the over-
all small sample size of our pilot study, the possibility of a type
II error cannot be excluded. Second, given the cross-sectional
nature of the study, we cannot ascertain if changes in diet be-
fore the start of the study or the presence of disease at baseline
changed a participant’s metabolomic profile. However, when we
restricted our analyses to those without type 2 diabetes at base-
line, our results remained largely consistent. Third, the use of
an FFQ to measure diet may introduce some degree of mea-
surement error. However, given that measurement errors in diet
are unlikely to be related to objective measures of metabolite
data, observed associations are likely to be attenuated toward
the null. Fourth, our study population was limited to Asian Indi-
ans living in the United States, and it remains unclear if our find-
ings can be generalized to other ethnic groups or South Asians
living in South Asia. Still, the consistency of our findings with
those in European populations and in a smaller study in south
Indians in India enhances the external validity of our findings.
Fifth, although we carefully adjusted for several known factors
that could confound the association between diet and metabo-
lites, reverse causation due to prevalent disease and residual con-
founding remain a strong possibility. Nevertheless, to address
the issue of reverse causation, when we restricted our analyses to
those without type 2 diabetes, the results remained largely con-
sistent with the overall study sample. Finally, although there is
some evidence from European populations that polymorphisms
associated with insulin resistance may have an effect on cir-
culating concentrations of BCAAs (47), to our knowledge, no
such study exists in Asian Indians. Furthermore, it is unlikely
that any such polymorphisms, which would differentially affect
BCAA concentrations, would be more prevalent among those
who consume a Western dietary pattern.

Taken together, our findings shed some insights into po-
tential mechanistic pathways through which diet can influence
cardiometabolic risk. Because a Western/nonvegetarian pattern
was associated with a metabolomic signature known to be re-
lated to disease risk, our findings support public health recom-
mendations to adopt a healthy eating pattern that focuses on
a high variety of vegetables from all subgroups, fruit, whole
grains, fat-free or low-fat dairy, a variety of plant proteins (e.g.,
nuts, legumes, seeds, and soy products), seafood, and lean meats
and poultry, and limiting saturated fats, trans fats, added sug-
ars, and sodium (48). Although Asian Indians are at a higher
risk of cardiometabolic diseases than their white counterparts
(17), it is important to note that nearly 90% of the study partic-
ipants were immigrants and many may have acculturated and
adopted a “Western”-style diet, thereby potentially compound-
ing their risk for cardiometabolic diseases. Although the vege-
tarian diet pattern was not associated with an adverse metabolic
profile in this study, it is worth mentioning that this pattern
was not “healthy” because it loaded heavily on unhealthy foods
such as rice (primarily white rice), sugar-containing beverages,
and snacks, which have been shown previously to increase car-
diometabolic risk (49, 50). In fact, the only healthy food group
that defined this vegetarian pattern was legumes. Although we
do not have data from the Indian subcontinent, the composition
of the vegetarian pattern may be a reflection of the global nu-
trition transition in which traditional diets rich in whole grains,
legumes, fruit, and vegetables are being replaced with more re-
fined grains, sugar-sweetened beverages, and increasing intakes

8 Bhupathiraju et al.

of meat products and salt (51). In fact, we found that among
those without type 2 diabetes, vegetable consumption was
positively associated with a BCAA, aromatic amino acid, and
short-chain AC metabolite pattern which is likely due to unmea-
sured confounding due to these other unhealthy components. It
is therefore imperative to examine how “vegetarianism,” cook-
ing methods of vegetables, particularly with regard to exposure
to such refined fats as ghee, and the overall quality of a vegetar-
ian diet among Asian Indians relate to cardiometabolic risk.

In conclusion, we found that a Western/nonvegetarian
dietary pattern in Asian Indians was positively associated with
a metabolomic signature characterized by BCAAs, aromatic
amino acids, and short-chain ACs, which, in turn, were ad-
versely associated with measures of glycemia, lipid measures,
and the liver-to-spleen attenuation ratio. Public health efforts to
lower cardiometabolic risk should focus on adapting a healthy
plant-based diet as outlined in the 2015 Dietary Guidelines for
Americans (48). Given the cross-sectional nature of our study,
future prospective studies should confirm our findings and
explore the association between the quality of plant-based
diets, metabolomic signatures, and cardiometabolic risk. At the
same time, to elucidate the diet-metabolome-disease relation, it
is important to examine whether changes in diet can influence
the metabolic profile and the development of cardiometabolic
disease.

ABSTRACT
Background: Total or red meat intake has been shown to be asso-
ciated with a higher risk of mortality in Western populations, but
little is known of the risks in Asian populations.
Objective: We examined temporal trends in meat consumption and
associations between meat intake and all-cause and cause-speciﬁc
mortality in Asia.
Design: We used ecological data from the United Nations to com-
pare country-speciﬁc meat consumption. Separately, 8 Asian pro-
spective cohort studies in Bangladesh, China, Japan, Korea, and
Taiwan consisting of 112,310 men and 184,411 women were fol-
lowed for 6.6 to 15.6 y with 24,283 all-cause, 9558 cancer, and 6373
cardiovascular disease (CVD) deaths. We estimated the study-
speciﬁc HRs and 95% CIs by using a Cox regression model and
pooled them by using a random-effects model.
Results: Red meat consumption was substantially lower in the Asian
countries than in the United States. Fish and seafood consumption
was higher in Japan and Korea than in the United States. Our pooled
analysis found no association between intake of total meat (red meat,
poultry, and ﬁsh/seafood) and risks of all-cause, CVD, or cancer
mortality among men and women; HRs (95% CIs) for all-cause mor-
tality from a comparison of the highest with the lowest quartile were
1.02 (0.91, 1.15) in men and 0.93 (0.86, 1.01) in women.
Conclusions: Ecological data indicate an increase in meat intake in
Asian countries; however, our pooled analysis did not provide ev-
idence of a higher risk of mortality for total meat intake and pro-
vided evidence of an inverse association with red meat, poultry, and
ﬁsh/seafood. Red meat intake was inversely associated with CVD
mortality in men and with cancer mortality in women in Asian
countries.

INTRODUCTION

Asia is experiencing marked changes in lifestyle and disease
patterns, similar to those seen in Western countries (1, 2), with
projected increases in the proportions of deaths from cancer,
ischemic heart disease, and cardiovascular disease (CVD)4 (3).
Therefore, it is important to identify modiﬁable risk factors,
such as diet, which may be responsible for the rising rates of
chronic disease in Asian populations.

Meat intake varies across regions and countries in Asia, with
relatively low consumption in certain countries compared with

others in the continent (4). Meat intake, speciﬁcally red meat, has
been associated with an increased risk of mortality in Western
populations (5, 6), although further studies are warranted in
populations that consume different quantities and types of meat
and have dissimilar confounding factors. Many mechanisms

supporting a detrimental effect of meat have been proposed in
relation to speciﬁc outcomes: an adverse lipid proﬁle and free
radical generation as a result of high intakes of SFA and iron,
mutagens generated by high-temperature cooking (7, 8), and N-
nitroso compounds formed in processed meat and endogenously
from heme iron (9). The different rates of change and economic
development in Asian countries provide a fertile environment
for conducting etiologic research on chronic disease, because it
provides a large range of exposures and a variety of endpoints.
We initiated the Asia Cohort Consortium (ACC) to understand
chronic disease etiology in Asia, where the association between
dietary factors and chronic diseases has not been extensively
studied. In the current study, we 1) compared ecological trends
in meat intake over the past 37 y between Asia and the United
States and 2) assessed whether meat intake was associated with
all-cause, cancer and CVD mortality by using individual, pro-
spective data from a pooled analysis of Asian cohort studies
involving 296,721 men and women.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS

Meat consumption in Asia

We compared temporal trends in meat consumption in Ban-
gladesh, China, Japan, South Korea, and the United States with
the use of the FAO database (10). We compared meat con-
sumption in Asia with that in the United States because of high
meat consumption in the United States and supportive evidence
for high mortality with high meat intake in a large US cohort
study (5, 6). The FAO Statistical Database, the world’s largest
online agricultural database (available at http://faostat.fao.org/,
accessed 13 June 2012), details historical and chronologic
population-based production and disappearance data (referred to
as food availability). For livestock production and product
consumption, FAO has compiled relevant data—including agricul-
tural production, ﬁsh production, trade, food supply, food balance

sheets, supply utilization accounts, and population size—sub-
mitted by member countries in the form of replies to FAO
questionnaires (11). The FAO Statistical Database provides data
on per capita consumption of meat, beef, pork, poultry, and ﬁsh
and seafood and deﬁnes total meat (excluding ﬁsh) as the sum of
beef, poultry, pork, mutton, goat, and game. Per capita con-
sumption (kcal/person per year) is the total amount of food in
each commodity available for each individual in the total pop-
ulation during the period 1970–2007, representing the average
amount available for the population as a whole.

Study population

The ACC was described elsewhere (12). For the meat and
mortality analysis, a total of 8 prospective cohort studies from
Bangladesh, mainland China, Japan, Korea, and Taiwan were
included. We excluded participants who did not provide food-
frequency questionnaires (FFQs) (n = 8177) and those for whom
time under study was missing (n = 467). A total of 296,721
(112,310 men and 184,411 women) were included in this
analysis. Each cohort collected cause-speciﬁc deaths through
linkage to death registries or active follow-up. The study was
reviewed and approved by the ethics committee for all partici-
pating cohort studies and by the institutional review board of
Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center.

Assessment of dietary and nondietary factors

Each study assessed food intake with a validated FFQ con-
sisting of the frequency of intake, further qualiﬁed as speciﬁed
portions (weights, numbers, or servings) or serving sizes (eg,
a half bowl, one bowl) (13–18). The number of items for red
meat, poultry, and ﬁsh varied from 6 to 17 across studies (see
Supplemental Table 1 under “Supplemental data” in the online
issue). We quantiﬁed food-group intake in grams per day or
servings per day using the reported frequency of intake of each
relevant food item and study-speciﬁc portion sizes. Data on age,
education, alcohol intake, tobacco smoking, and residence were
collected through self-administered questionnaire or interview.
Height and weight were self-reported or directly measured. BMI
was calculated by dividing weight (in kg) by the square of height
(in m).

Statistical analysis

Using individual-level data, we calculated study-speciﬁc HRs
and 95% CIs using a Cox proportional hazards model; age was
used as the time metric. Person-years of follow-up were estimated
from the baseline entry date until the date of death, loss to follow-
up (if applicable), or end of follow-up, whichever came ﬁrst.

varied across studies, in the main analysis, we obtained HRs and
95% CIs using study- and sex-speciﬁc quartiles of grams per day
of each food group. For males and females separately, cohort-
speciﬁc HRs were pooled to compute cross-cohort estimates by
using a random-effects model. The random-effects model also
produced a trend test for pooled HR estimates. Tertiles rather
than quartiles of poultry intake were used to ensure an adequate
number of cases in each category. In supplemental analyses, we
computed pooled cohort HRs from cohort-speciﬁc estimates
computed by using uniform cutoffs rather than cohort-speciﬁc
cutoffs to construct intake quartiles and tertiles. In other sup-

plemental analyses, we included 2 additional cohort studies that
offered nonquantitative dietary intake data: 1) the Korean Multi-
Center Cancer Cohort Study (19) and 2) the Radiation Effects
Research Foundation in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the Life Span
Study cohort (20), which had assessed diet by using non-
quantitative FFQs (data on frequency of intake only). We tested
for heterogeneity across studies using a likelihood ratio test that
compared random- and ﬁxed-effect models for pooled cohort
effect estimates. Because socioeconomic status may be related
to meat intake and disease pattern in Asian populations and
because meat intake varies over time, we also examined whether

the associations varied by educational level. Also, we examined
whether BMI, smoking status, or baseline period modiﬁed the
associations. All statistical tests were 2-sided and P values
,0.05 were considered to be statistically signiﬁcant. We used
SAS version 9.3 (SAS Institute) for the analyses.

RESULTS

Consumption trends using ecologic data

We examined temporal trends in per capita consumption of
meat, beef, pork, poultry, and ﬁsh/seafood with the use of the
international FAO database (Figure 1 and Figure 2). We com-
pared meat-consumption patterns between the United States and
Asian populations because there have been numerous meat- and
chronic disease–related studies conducted in the United States
(5, 6, 21–23). Ecological data indicate an increase in meat intake
in Asian countries. Per capita consumption of meat (excluding
ﬁsh) in the United States was .2 times that in China, Japan, and
South Korea and .33 times that in Bangladesh in the 1990s and
2000s (Figure 1). In 2007, average meat consumption in the
United States was 122.8 kg/y, whereas consumption in China,
Japan, and South Korea ranged from 46.1 to 55.9 kg/y. Per
capita beef consumption has decreased to some degree in the
past decade in the United States but still remains substantially
higher than that in Asian countries. Beef consumption increased
in China, Japan, and Korea from 1970 to 2007. Although beef
consumption in the United States remains higher, the gap with
Japan or Korea has progressively decreased; in 1970, the dif-
ference was 18-fold; in 1980, it was 10-fold; in 1990, it was 5-
fold; and in 2007, it was 4-fold. Per capita consumption of pork
has continued to rise in China, Japan, and Korea; consumption
in China and Korea has now surpassed consumption in the
United States. Per capita consumption of poultry has been rising

in China, Japan, South Korea, and the United States, but the
difference between the United States and Asian countries re-
mained substantial. Per capita consumption of ﬁsh and seafood
in Japan and Korea has remained higher than that in the United
States; consumption in China has risen to a level similar to that
in the United States but that is still substantially lower than that
in Japan and Korea.

When we compared the proportions of per capita consumption
of beef, pork, poultry, and ﬁsh/seafood in Bangladesh, China,
Japan, and Korea with those in the United States, using the 2000
FAO database, the proportions of ﬁsh/seafood consumption in
Asian countries were higher than those in the United States
(34%–85% compared with 15%), whereas total meat con-
sumption (largely beef and poultry, totaling 64%) in the United
States was higher than that in Asian countries (Figure 2). China
consumed the highest proportion of pork (45%) and Bangladesh
and Japan consumed the highest proportion of ﬁsh/seafood (85%
in Bangladesh and 60% in Japan).

Individual consumption and mortality

In our pooled analysis of the ACC data, the mean follow-up
period ranged from 6.6 to 15.6 y. Most studies began enrollment in
the early to mid 1990s (Table 1). Mean intakes of red meat and
poultry in men were 14.2–92.3 and 4.6–22.3 g/d, respectively
(Table 2). In women, mean intakes of red meat ranged from a low
of 9.9 g/d in the Ohsaki National Health Insurance Cohort Study
to 50.9 g/d in the Shanghai Women’s Health Study. Poultry intake
ranged from 2.8 to 15.4 g/d in women. Mean ﬁsh and seafood
intake was .45 g/d in men and .36 g/d in women.

Higher total meat intake was not associated with a higher risk
of all-cause, cancer, or CVD mortality in either men or women
(Table 3). In men, HRs (95% CIs) for the comparison of the highest
with the lowest quartile were 1.02 (0.91, 1.15; P-trend = 0.82) for

FFQs. We examined whether there were similar associations be-
tween frequencies of meat intake and all-cause, cancer, and CVD
mortality. Similar to the results in the analysis of grams per day,
we found no statistically signiﬁcant associations for total meat
intake with frequency of total meat consumption as the main
exposure (data not shown). Furthermore, when we used common
cutoffs rather than cohort-speciﬁc cutoffs to construct intake
quartiles, the results were similar for total meat intake (data not
shown). When we examined the associations for intakes of total
meat, red meat, poultry, and ﬁsh in individual cohort studies, we
found generally similar patterns with pooled results (see Sup-
plemental Table 2 under “Supplemental data” in the online is-
sue). Because socioeconomic status may have been linked to
meat availability during the study period, we investigated whether
associations varied by educational level (less than secondary,
secondary, and more than secondary graduate) (Table 4). We
found no statistically signiﬁcant associations for all-cause mor-
tality with total meat intake in any education stratum. For red
meat intake, a lower risk of all-cause mortality was observed at
the second and third quartiles in women with less than secondary
school education. When we stratiﬁed BMI into 3 groups (BMI
,20, 20 to ,25, and $25), we found similar associations be-
tween total meat intake and all-cause mortality in both men and
women. A comparison of the highest with the lowest quartile
resulted in HRs (95% CIs) of 1.10 (0.94, 1.28) for men with
a BMI ,20, 1.01 (0.88, 1.16) for men with a BMI of 20 to ,25,
and 1.01 (0.82, 1.24) for men with a BMI $25; the respective
values for women were 0.85 (0.70, 1.04) for women with a BMI
,20, 1.00 (0.84, 1.18) for women with a BMI of 20 to ,25, and
0.91 (0.77, 1.06) for women with a BMI $25. When we limited
our analysis to never-smokers, HRs for total meat intake in re-
lation to all-cause mortality in a comparison of the highest with
the lowest quartile were 1.12 (0.97, 1.29) in men and 0.94 (0.87,
1.02) in women. We also found that baseline period (before or
after 1995) did not modify any of the associations between total
meat, red meat, poultry, or ﬁsh/seafood and risk of all-cause
mortality (data not shown). When we excluded participants who
died within the ﬁrst 3 y of follow-up, we found that the results of
total meat, red meat, poultry, or ﬁsh/seafood were similar for all-
cause, cancer, and CVD mortality (data not shown).

DISCUSSION

Even with the marked increase in industrialization and urban-
ization in Asian countries, food-availability data from FAO in-
dicated that meat consumption was still substantially higher in
the United States than in any Asian country. The main differences
between meat consumption in the United States and Asia were seen
for beef and poultry. Even though meat consumption has continued
to rise in China, Japan, and South Korea and even though the gap
between the United States and Asian countries has narrowed, meat
consumption in Asia has remained lower than that in the United
States into the 21st century. In contrast, ﬁsh and seafood con-
sumption in Japan and Korea is .2-fold that in the United States.
Our pooled analysis of 8 Asian prospective cohort studies did
not provide evidence of a higher risk of mortality for total meat
intake. For red meat and poultry, inverse associations were ob-
served for mortality in both men and women. We found that ﬁsh
intake was inversely associated with risk of mortality in women.
No variation in the associations between mortality and total meat
intake were observed by educational levels or study period.

Overall cancer and CVD mortality has increased in Asian
countries (24–26), and mortality rates from some cancers are
approaching those in Western countries (24, 27). Given the trend
of increasing meat consumption over time in Asia, a westernized
diet heavy in animal products has been invoked as a cause of this
increasing incidence and mortality from cancer and CVD (28).
However, Asian prospective cohort studies (29–33), most of
which were included in our pooled analysis, have not supported
the hypothesis that meat intake is involved in all-cause, cancer,
or CVD mortality, unlike the pattern seen in Europe and North
America (5, 6, 34, 35).

The absence of a positive association between meat intake and
mortality in Asia may be related to several factors. First, Asia has
been experiencing a dramatic change in many other chronic
disease risk factors, including physical activity, adiposity, and
access to medical care. At this stage, it is possible that meat
consumption may not be as large a contributor to risk of death as
socioeconomic status, a sedentary lifestyle (36, 37), or adiposity.
Furthermore, other risk factors such as obesity (12), hypertension
(38), and smoking (39) could largely explain the increasing risks
of cancer or CVD in Asia to date. Second, the null, and even
inverse, association between meat consumption and mortality
observed in our data warrants further study because the dietary
transition is still under way in many parts of Asia. Residual or
unmeasured confounding factors, such as socioeconomic status
related to meat availability, could be important because food
accessibility and availability is related to income levels in the
Asia-Paciﬁc region (40); ie, even though we failed to detect
differences by education, a higher intake of meat at this point in
the epidemiologic transition may be a marker for other protective
factors, including a sufﬁcient intake of energy and access to
medical care. Third, nondifferential measurement error in dietary
assessments could have led to bias toward the null, although all
the FFQs used in each study have been validated with modest
to good correlation with a reference method (13–18). Although
the absence of a positive association can be partly explained by
aforementioned reasons, we still cannot rule out the hypothesis
that total meat intake is not related to mortality in Asian pop-
ulations, given the ﬁndings we observed in this pooled analysis.
A reduced risk of all-cause and cancer mortality with higher
ﬁsh intakes in women could be explained as a result of delayed
progression of disease through inhibition of eicosanoid bio-
synthesis, which leads to a reduction in prostaglandin conversion
from arachidonic acid (41, 42). We found an inverse association
in women only, perhaps because social and cultural differences
between men and women determine health behaviors such as
alcohol intake and tobacco smoking in Asia; therefore, these risk
factors could play a role to a lesser extent in women than in men.
The strengths of our study include the size of the total ACC
cohort and a prospective study design with assessment of long-
term usual dietary intake. In the ACC study, we were able to
include unpublished individual data from some Asian studies,
which provides greater accuracy than meta-analyses. We had
extensive information on potential confounders. Furthermore, we
analyzed the data and adjusted for confounding factors in
a standardized, uniform way by using the original data from each
cohort, which is not allowed in a meta-analysis.

Our study had several limitations. Unmeasured or residual
confounding may still exist, although we adjusted for potential
confounding factors, including alcohol intake, fruit and vegetable

times during the study period of each cohort. Heterogeneity in
intake was observed across studies; however, we found that
study-speciﬁc results in general did not show an increased risk of
mortality with higher total meat intake. We could not investigate
the role of meat intake with speciﬁc types of CVD and cancer
outcomes because we did not have the relevant information from
the different cohorts. However, our ﬁnding warrants subsequent
studies to explore the role of diet in the development of speciﬁc
CVD or cancer outcomes in this ACC study.

In conclusion, our pooled analysis of prospective cohort
studies showed that higher total and red meat consumption was
not associated with an increased risk of cancer or CVD mortality.
Fish and seafood intake was inversely associated with mortality
in women. Additional dietary studies among Asian populations
are needed to elucidate outstanding questions: 1) Is meat intake
associated with an increased risk of cancer and CVD mortality
beyond changes in lifestyle and environmental factors?; 2) Do
some, as yet undeﬁned, characteristics of Asian populations
explain the association that we observed with meat intake?; and
3) Is the cumulative exposure to a high intake of meat crucial to
disease etiology?

Coronary Heart Disease

Major Dietary Protein Sources and Risk of Coronary Heart

Disease in Women

Background—With the exception of fish, few major dietary protein sources have been studied in relation to the
development of coronary heart disease (CHD). Our objective was to examine the relation between foods that are major
dietary protein sources and incident CHD.

Methods and Results—We prospectively followed 84 136 women aged 30 to 55 years in the Nurses’ Health Study with
no known cancer, diabetes mellitus, angina, myocardial infarction, stroke, or other cardiovascular disease. Diet was
assessed by a standardized and validated questionnaire and updated every 4 years. During 26 years of follow-up, we
documented 2210 incident nonfatal infarctions and 952 deaths from CHD. In multivariable analyses including age,
smoking, and other risk factors, higher intakes of red meat, red meat excluding processed meat, and high-fat dairy were
significantly associated with elevated risk of CHD. Higher intakes of poultry, fish, and nuts were significantly associated
with lower risk. In a model controlling statistically for energy intake, 1 serving per day of nuts was associated with a
30% (95% confidence interval, 17% to 42%) lower risk of CHD compared with 1 serving per day of red meat. Similarly,
compared with 1 serving per day of red meat, a lower risk was associated with 1 serving per day of low-fat dairy (13%;
95% confidence interval, 6% to 19%), poultry (19%; 95% confidence interval, 3% to 33%), and fish (24%; 95%
confidence interval, 6% to 39%).

Conclusions—These data suggest that high red meat intake increases risk of CHD and that CHD risk may be reduced

importantly by shifting sources of protein in the US diet. (Circulation. 2010;122:876-883.)

With the exception of fish, relatively few foods that are

major sources of dietary protein have been examined
in relation to incident coronary heart disease (CHD). The
relation of these foods to CHD may not be predicted by the
composition of their individual nutrients because of either
synergy or antagonism among the nutrients or because of the
presence of other constituents in the foods. Although neither
animal protein nor vegetable protein has been associated with
CHD risk,1 other nutrients in protein-rich foods, such as
saturated fat,2,3 polyunsaturated fat,3,4 and vitamins E, B6, and
folate,5 have been associated with risk.

Editorial see p 859

Clinical Perspective on p 883

We have reported previously on the relation between red
meat, poultry, fish, and dairy products in relation to CHD risk
over 14 years.2 We observed that red meat was not signifi-
cantly associated with CHD, but increasing poultry and fish
intake was associated with a decreased risk. A clear under-

standing of the relation between these food groups and CHD
risk over a longer period of time, as well as an examination of
the individual foods that contribute to each food group and
the relation of other major dietary protein sources and CHD
risk, would allow individuals to reduce their risk by substi-
tuting one protein source for another. This type of dietary
change may be easier to accomplish than trying to substitute
one nutrient for another or one dietary pattern for another. We
therefore examined the relation between major sources of
dietary protein and the development of CHD in a large cohort
of women with 26 years of follow-up.

Methods

Study Population
The Nurses’ Health Study began in 1976 when 121 700 female
registered nurses aged 30 to 55 years and residing in 11 US states
provided detailed information on their medical history and lifestyle.
Every 2 years, follow-up questionnaires have been sent to update
information on potential risk factors and to identify newly diagnosed

cases of CHD and other diseases. In 1980, a 61-item food-frequency
questionnaire (FFQ) was included to assess intake of specific foods.
In 1984, the FFQ was expanded to include 116 food items. Similar
questionnaires were used to update dietary intake in 1986, 1990,
1994, 1998, and 2002. As in our previous analyses, we excluded
those who left ⬎10 items blank on the 1980 FFQ, those with
implausibly low or high scores for total food or energy intake (ie,
⬍2094 kJ [500 kcal] or ⬎14 650 kJ [3500 kcal] per day), and those
with previously diagnosed cancer, diabetes mellitus, angina, myo-
cardial infarction, stroke, or other cardiovascular disease (including
a history of coronary artery bypass grafting).1–3,6 The final 1980
baseline population consisted of 84 136 women.

The study was approved by the Committee on the Use of Human
Subjects in Research at Brigham and Women’s Hospital. All subjects
gave informed consent to participate.

Ascertainment of Diet
To calculate intakes of specific protein sources, a commonly used
unit or portion size for each food was specified on the FFQ (eg, 1
slice of processed meat or 1 hamburger patty), and the nurse was
asked how often on average during the previous year she had
consumed that amount (for portion sizes, see the online-only Data
Supplement). Nine responses were possible, ranging from “never” to
“⬎6 times per day.” The major protein sources on the FFQs include
the following: chicken with and without skin, chicken sandwich,
regular and lean hamburger, beef /pork hot dog, chicken/turkey hot
dog, processed meat sandwich, bacon, beef/pork/lamb mixed dish,
beef/pork/lamb main dish, beef liver, chicken liver, skim or low-fat
milk, whole milk, yogurt, ice cream, cottage cheese, and hard cheese.
The reproducibility and validity of the FFQs in measuring food
intake have been described previously in detail.7–11

Women were divided into fifths of cumulative average intake of
various protein sources to reduce within-person variation and best
represent long-term diet. These averages were calculated by calcu-
lating the mean of all FFQ intakes from all available FFQs up to the
beginning of a follow-up interval. The cumulative average intake
was then associated with CHD incidence from the time of the last
returned questionnaire until the next follow-up cycle. If dietary data
from a particular FFQ were missing, then the cumulative average of
that FFQ cycle would be the last cumulative average carried forward.
We stopped updating a participant’s cumulative average intake
when she developed an intermediate outcome on the causal pathway
between diet and CHD, such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension,
angina, or hypercholesterolemia. We also stopped updating diet at
the diagnosis of cancer or stroke or after coronary artery bypass. This
was done because changes in diet after these diagnoses or events may
bias the diet-disease association (ie, these diagnoses can be con-
founders).2,3 In sensitivity analyses, however, we examined cumu-
lative average intake that was continually updated even after inter-
mediate outcomes.

Ascertainment of End Point
The primary end point for this study was nonfatal myocardial
infarction or fatal CHD occurring after the return of the 1980 FFQ
but before June 1, 2006. After report of an infarction, permission to
obtain medical records was requested, and these were reviewed by
study physicians with no knowledge of the subjects’ self-reported
risk factor status. Myocardial infarction was confirmed by World
Health Organization criteria: symptoms plus either diagnostic ECG
changes or elevated cardiac enzymes.12 Infarctions that required
hospital admission and for which confirmatory information was
obtained by interview or letter, but for which no medical records
were available, were designated as probable (527 of 2210 cases of
nonfatal myocardial infarction [24%]). We included all confirmed
and probable cases in our report because results were similar after
probable cases were excluded.

Deaths were identified from state vital records and the National
Death Index or were reported by next of kin or the postal system.
Follow-up for deaths has been shown to be ⬎98% complete.13 Fatal
CHD was defined as a fatal myocardial infarction only if confirmed
by medical records, next-of-kin or contact person, or autopsy report

or if CHD was listed as cause of death on the death certificate and
there was evidence of previous coronary disease. We considered
sudden death within 1 hour of the onset of symptoms in women with
no other plausible cause of death other than coronary disease as fatal
CHD; these cases constituted 146 of 952 or 15% of fatal CHD cases.
Fatal CHD was designated as presumed if the underlying cause on
the death certificate was CHD but no records were available. These
cases constituted 193 of 952 or 20% of fatal CHD cases. Analyses
limited to confirmed cases yielded results similar to those of analyses
with both confirmed and presumed cases.

Data Analysis
We evaluated the individual associations between red meat, poultry,
canned tuna, dark- and light-fleshed fish, nuts, and beans in relation
to the risk of CHD. We also examined protein source “groups”—
total meat (including chicken with and without skin, chicken sand-
wich, hamburger, beef and chicken/turkey hot dog, processed meat
and processed meat sandwich, bacon, beef/pork/lamb as a mixed and
main dish, beef and chicken liver), red meat (hamburger, beef hot
dog, processed meat and processed meat sandwich, bacon, beef/pork/
lamb as a mixed and main dish), poultry (chicken with and without
skin, chicken sandwich, and chicken/turkey hot dog), fish (canned
tuna, dark- and light-fleshed fish, and breaded fish), high-fat dairy
(whole milk, ice cream, hard cheese, full-fat cheese, cream, sour
cream, cream cheese, butter), low-fat dairy (skim/low-fat milk, 1%
and 2% milk, yogurt, cottage and ricotta cheeses, low-fat cheese,
sherbert)—and their relation to CHD. We also analyzed the ratio of
red meat to poultry and red meat to poultry plus fish in relation to
incidence of CHD. We estimated the association between animal and
vegetable protein and incidence of CHD. We investigated the effect
of “substituting” a serving of one major protein source for another by
including both as continuous variables in the same multivariable
model. The difference in their coefficients plus their covariance was
used to estimate the relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence interval
(CI) for the substitution.14

Person-years of follow-up for each participant were calculated
from the return of the 1980 FFQ to the date of the first CHD event,
death, or June 1, 2006, whichever came first. The RR was computed
with the use of a proportional hazards regression model, with the rate
in a specific fifth divided by that in the lowest fifth, with adjustment
by age in months and calendar time (2-year follow-up period).
Median values of intake for each fifth were used to test for a linear
trend across fifths.

In multivariable proportional hazards models, in addition to age
and calendar time, we simultaneously controlled for intakes of total
energy (kcal), cereal fiber (g/d), alcohol (g/d), and trans unsaturated
fatty acids (g/d), as well as other potential nondietary confounding
variables. These variables were updated biennially and include body
mass index (⬍22, 22 to 24, 24 to 25, 25 to 27, 27 to 29, 29 to 30, 30
to 32, 32 to 35, 35 to 40, ⬎40), physical exercise (⬍3, 3 to 9, 9 to
18, 18 to 27, ⱖ27 metabolic equivalents per week), cigarette
smoking (never, past, current 1 to 14 cigarettes per day, current 14 to
25 cigarettes per day, current ⱖ25 cigarettes per day), menopausal
status (premenopausal, postmenopausal with no history of hormone
replacement, postmenopausal with a history of hormone replace-
ment, postmenopausal with current hormone replacement), parental
history of early myocardial infarction (defined as infarction before
age 65 years for a participant’s mother or before age 55 years for a
participant’s father), years of multivitamin use, vitamin E supple-
ment use (yes/no), and aspirin use at least once per week (yes/no).
The last value was carried forward for one 2-year cycle to replace
missing values. If the last value was missing, then a missing value
indicator was created. In the models with animal and vegetable
protein, we built 2 models. The first included the main exposures
plus the aforementioned covariates, and the second included main
exposures plus the aforementioned covariates and saturated fat,
monounsaturated fat, and polyunsaturated fatty acids. Neither the
diagnoses of diabetes mellitus, angina, hypertension, or hypercho-
lesterolemia nor use of the medications that are prescribed to treat
these diseases were included in any of the multivariable models
because these may all be considered intermediate outcomes on the

Results

During 2 050 071 person-years of follow-up from 1980
through 2006, we documented 2210 nonfatal infarctions and
952 deaths from CHD. Our follow-up rate (defined as
person-years contributed by study participants until their last
returned FFQ or death divided by person-years contributed by
study participants until death) was 97%. Between 1980 and
2002, red meat consumption decreased from a median intake
of 1.06 to 0.49 servings per day, whereas poultry consump-
tion increased from 0.14 to 0.28 servings per day, and fish
consumption remained unchanged. Characteristics of the
study participants during the 26 years of follow-up, averaged
according to proportion of person-time in each fifth of intake,
are shown in Table 1. High red meat consumption was
associated with higher rates of smoking, angina, hyperten-
sion, hypercholesterolemia, and diabetes mellitus,
lower
physical activity, increased intake of trans fat, and decreased
intake of vitamin E and multivitamins. The major groups of
protein sources were not highly correlated with each other:
The Spearman correlation coefficient of red meat with poul-
try was ⫺0.09; that of red meat with fish was ⫺0.17; and that
of poultry with fish was 0.39.

In age-adjusted analyses, higher intakes of red meat, red
meat excluding processed meat, red meat to poultry ratio, red
meat
to poultry plus fish ratio, and high-fat dairy were
significantly associated with increased risk of CHD. Higher
intakes of poultry, fish, and low-fat dairy sources were
significantly associated with decreased risk (Table 2). When
we controlled for age, follow-up period, and smoking status,

the significant associations seen in the age-adjusted analyses
remained. In multivariable analyses (Table 2) that adjusted
for dietary and nondietary cardiovascular disease risk factors,
the associations were reduced in magnitude but remained
significant for all of the protein groups except low-fat dairy.
Fruit and vegetable intake was only weakly to moderately
correlated with intake of all of the major protein sources, and
further adjustment for it had no effect on the risk associations.
Egg intake was not associated with risk in either age-adjusted
or multivariable models.

In age-adjusted analyses, animal protein was associated
with increased risk, and vegetable protein was associated
with decreased risk (animal protein RR across fifths: 1.00,
trend⫽0.01]; vegetable
0.94, 0.96, 0.96, 1.14 [P for
protein RR across fifths: 1.00, 0.84, 0.77, 0.69, 0.62 [P for
trend ⬍0.0001]). In the multivariable analyses, vegetable
protein but not animal protein remained significantly
associated with decreased risk (vegetable protein RR
across fifths: 1.00, 0.88, 0.85, 0.80, 0.72 [P for trend
⬍0.001]). However, when we included polyunsaturated
fat, monounsaturated fat, and saturated fat in the multivari-
able models, we found no relation between animal or
vegetable protein and CHD risk.

When we continued updating a participant’s diet even after
she had been diagnosed with angina, diabetes mellitus,
hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, cancer, or stroke or had
a coronary artery bypass, we saw associations with red meat
that were similar to those obtained when we stopped
updating diet at

associated with CHD risk. When we stopped updating diet
at
the diagnosis of an intermediate outcome and also
controlled for their presence in the multivariable model,
red meat, poultry, fish, and high-fat dairy all remained
significantly related to risk of CHD.

In the analyses of individual protein sources, higher intake
of red and processed meats were associated with increased
risk, whereas higher intakes of fish, nuts, and beans were
associated with decreased risk (Table 3). When compared
with 1 serving per day of red meat, 1 serving per day of nuts,
fish, poultry, or dairy was associated with a decreased risk of

CHD (Figure). One serving per day of nuts was associated
with a 30% (95% CI, 17% to 42%) lower risk of CHD
compared with 1 serving per day of red meat. Similarly, when
compared with 1 serving per day of red meat, 1 serving per
day of low-fat dairy was associated with a 13% (95% CI, 6%
to 19%) lower risk, 1 serving per day of poultry was
associated with a 19% (95% CI, 3% to 33%) lower risk, and
1 serving per day of fish was associated with a 24% (95% CI,
6% to 39%) lower risk.

risk, whereas 1 serving per day of nuts or beans was not
significantly associated with risk.

Discussion

In this prospective cohort study with 26 years of follow-up,
we observed that a higher consumption of red meat was
associated with an increased risk of CHD. The positive
association was independent of established dietary and non-
dietary cardiovascular risk factors as well as fruit and
vegetable intake. When compared with red meat, intakes of
dairy, poultry, fish, and especially nuts were associated with
substantially lower risk of coronary disease.

To date, only a few prospective and case-control studies
have examined major dietary protein sources and risk of
CHD. Snowdon et al15 followed 25 153 California Seventh-
Day Adventists between 1960 and 1980 and observed that
their daily meat consumption was associated with a 70%
greater risk of fatal CHD in men and a 37% greater risk in
women. Gramenzi et al16 conducted a case-control study
among women with 287 cases and 649 controls. Women who
consumed ham and salami ⬎2 times per week had a signif-
icant 60% increased odds of myocardial infarction. Sinha et
al17 followed 322 263 men and 223 390 women in the
National Institutes of Health–American Association of Re-
tired Persons study for 10 years, documenting 71 252 deaths,
including 5356 deaths from cardiovascular disease among
women. They reported an increased risk of cardiovascular
mortality among women consuming high intakes of red and
processed meats (red meat: RR⫽1.50 for highest versus
lowest fifth; processed meat: RR⫽1.38 for highest versus
lowest fifth).

In an earlier analysis of the Nurses’ Health Study with 14
years of follow-up, increasing the ratio of red meat to poultry
plus fish was associated with a highly significant positive
association.2 A separate analysis with 16 years of follow-up
showed that higher fish consumption was associated with a
lower risk of CHD.4 Compared with these studies, our

analysis here has a longer follow-up period and greater
precision in dietary measurement because of a greater number
of cases and repeated dietary questionnaires.

When we continued updating diet throughout follow-up,
we no longer observed significant associations between
poultry, fish, or high-fat dairy and CHD risk. This suggests
that other diseases and events do in fact lead nurses to change
their diets and thus confound the diet-disease association. Red
meat, however, continued to be significantly related to CHD
risk even when we continually updated diet and when we
controlled for the intermediate outcomes. These results sug-
gest a strong association between red meat and CHD, inde-
pendent of measured confounders and known intermediate
outcomes.

The positive association between total meat and CHD risk
is likely driven by the high amount of red meat that makes up
total meat intake (Spearman coefficient of correlation⫽0.94).
The strong association between red meat and CHD is not
entirely explained by processed meat intake because red meat
remained associated with CHD risk even after processed meat
was excluded.

Dietary iron, and particularly the heme iron found in red
meat, has been positively associated with myocardial infarc-
tion and fatal CHD in most18 –22 but not all studies.23,24
Through its effect on systolic blood pressure, the high sodium
content of processed meats may be associated with CHD
risk.25,26 Compounds created by cooking red meat, including
heterocyclic amines and advanced glycation end-products,
may also be linked with CHD.27–34 Compared with polyun-
saturated fat, high intakes of saturated fat and cholesterol
have been linked with increased CHD risk.2,3 A recent
meta-analysis reported that saturated fat consumption was not
significantly associated with CHD risk35; however, in this
meta-analysis saturated fat was compared with other calorie
sources, primarily refined carbohydrates, and high intake of
refined carbohydrates has been associated with a high risk of
CHD.36 In another recent meta-analysis with findings similar

to ours, total red meat and processed red meat were both
positively associated with risk of CHD37; however, in this
meta-analysis, red meat was compared with other sources of
calories, and the published data did not allow for an explicit
comparison with protein sources. When major sources of
protein, such as nuts and fish, are used to replace red meat,
saturated fat, heme iron, and sodium decrease, whereas intake
of polyunsaturated fat increases. The benefit on CHD risk of
such a substitution is thus likely to be due to multiple
simultaneous changes in nutrient intake.

Our analysis has several important strengths and limita-
tions. The 26-year follow-up with updated dietary data, high
follow-up rate, and large number of study participants pro-
vided excellent power to detect differences in RRs across
fifths (for example, power for test for trend across 5 quantiles,
with 3162 cases and 80 974 controls and a 2-sided test with
␣⫽0.05, was 99.67%38). The ability to measure and control
for known cardiovascular risk factors in multivariable models
permitted less biased estimates of the independent association
of protein-rich foods with CHD risk. Measurement of dietary
data is imperfect, and measurement error would likely lead to
an underestimation of the true effect of the exposures with
outcome.6 The repeated dietary data serve to reduce random
error to some extent. Nevertheless, we cannot exclude the
possibility of residual and unmeasured confounding due to
the observational nature of this study.

In conclusion, in this large study of US women, we found
that greater consumption of red meat was associated with a
higher risk of CHD. Compared with the same number of
servings of red meat, consumption of fish, poultry, dairy
products, and especially nuts was associated with lower risk.
These findings suggest that the risk of CHD may be reduced
importantly by shifting the sources of protein in the US diet.

CLINICAL PERSPECTIVE

With the exception of fish, few major dietary protein sources have been studied in relation to the development of coronary
heart disease (CHD). Our objective was to examine the relation between foods that are major dietary protein sources and
incident CHD. We prospectively followed 84 136 women aged 30 to 55 years in the Nurses’ Health Study with no known
cancer, diabetes mellitus, angina, myocardial infarction, stroke, or other cardiovascular disease. During 26 years of
follow-up, we documented 2210 incident nonfatal infarctions and 952 deaths from CHD. In multivariate analyses including
age, smoking, and other known cardiovascular risk factors, a higher intake of red meat was significantly associated with
an elevated risk of CHD. Higher intakes of poultry, fish, and nuts were significantly associated with lower risk. In a model
controlling statistically for total energy intake, 1 serving per day of nuts was associated with a 30% (95% confidence
interval, 17% to 42%) lower risk of CHD compared with 1 serving per day of red meat. Similarly, compared with 1 serving
per day of red meat, 1 serving per day of low-fat dairy was associated with a 13% (95% confidence interval, 6% to 19%)
lower risk, 1 serving per day of poultry was associated with a 19% (95% confidence interval, 3% to 33%) lower risk, and
1 serving per day of fish was associated with a 24% (95% confidence interval, 6% to 39%) lower risk. These data suggest
that high red meat intake increases risk of CHD and that risk of CHD may be reduced importantly by shifting the sources
of protein in the US diet.

Abstract

Lutein and zeaxanthin accumulate in the macular pigment of the retina, and are reported to be associated with a reduced

incidence of age-related macular degeneration. A rich source of lutein and zeaxanthin in the American diet is the yolk of

chicken eggs. Thus, the objective of the study was to investigate the effect of consuming 1 egg/d for 5 wk on the serum

concentrations of lutein, zeaxanthin, lipids, and lipoprotein cholesterol in individuals .60 y of age. In a randomized cross-

over design, 33 men and women participated in the 18-wk study, which included one run-in and one washout period

of no eggs prior to and between two 5-wk interventions of either consuming 1 egg or egg substitute/d. Serum lutein 26%

(P , 0.001) and zeaxanthin 38% (P , 0.001) concentrations increased after 5-wk of 1 egg/d compared with the phase prior

to consuming eggs. Serum concentrations of total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides were

not affected. These ﬁndings indicate that in older adults, 5 wk of consuming 1 egg/d signiﬁcantly increases serum lutein

and zeaxanthin concentrations without elevating serum lipids and lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations. J. Nutr. 136:

Introduction

Age-related macular degeneration (AMD)5 is a progressive eye
condition that affects .13 million Americans or 5% of people
age 65 and older. This disease attacks the macula of the eye, the
area responsible for the sharpest central vision. There are two
forms of AMD: dry AMD and wet AMD (1). Although
investigators are uncertain of the direct causes of dry AMD,
studies suggest that the area of the retina becomes diseased
coincident with the accumulation of yellow pigments called
drusen leading to the slow breakdown of the light-sensing cells
in the macula and gradual loss of central vision (2). Whereas the
wet form of AMD is not considered to be inﬂuenced by dietary
manipulation, the dry form is responsive to nutrients such as
vitamins and minerals (3,4).

In addition to vitamins and minerals, evidence is now
accumulating that dietary and blood concentrations of lutein
and zeaxanthin, 2 oxygenated carotenoids that concentrate in
the macula of the eye, are associated with reduced risk of AMD

(5–8). There are several studies that suggest that certain fruits
and vegetables are good sources of lutein and zeaxanthin, and
their consumption has been associated with increased blood
concentrations and macular pigment concentration of these
carotenoids (6–9). These ﬁndings are important insofar as
preliminary evidence (10,11) and a more recent clinical trial (12)
suggest that lutein supplementation may also slow the progres-
sion of AMD.

Lutein and zeaxanthin play a role in the prevention of AMD
by aiding in the ﬁltering of damaging blue light and sunlight
(13). Because AMD is thought to be associated with long-term
oxidative damage to the retina (14,15), the reported ﬁndings,
that lutein and zeaxanthin are 2 very powerful antioxidants,
absorb ultraviolet light, and serve to protect the lens from
oxidative damage, would suggest an important role for these
nutrients in preventing or treating this disease (14). Human trials
with lutein and zeaxanthin supplements indicate that these
dietary carotenoids, in addition to fruits and vegetables, can be
used to elevate macular pigment concentration (16–20). The
chicken egg yolk, a matrix composed of digestible lipids, i.e.,
cholesterol,
triglycerides, and phospholipids, also contains
lutein and zeaxanthin dispersed in the matrix along with other
fat-soluble micronutrients such as vitamin A, vitamin D, and
vitamin E. The lipid matrix of the yolk of chicken eggs provides a
readily bioavailable dietary source of lutein and zeaxanthin that
is even more bioavailable than lutein supplements and spinach

(21). Two other reports (22,23) examined the same human
subjects (mean age 62 y, range: 46–78 y) and showed a 28–50%
increase in plasma lutein and a 114–142% increase in plasma
zeaxanthin concentrations (22) following a diet supplemented
with 1.3 eggs/d for 4.5 wk. However, this increase was as-
sociated with an 8–11% increase in plasma LDL cholesterol
(LDL-C) concentrations (23). These observations suggest that
eggs can be used by individuals who want to increase their
circulating concentrations of these carotenoids.

Thus, one of the objectives of this study was to investigate, in
an elderly population with a mean age of 79 y, whether the
serum concentrations of both lutein and zeaxanthin respond in a
similar manner to previous reports (22,23) when consuming
1 egg/d or increased cholesterol. Most studies either do not
include a source of dietary zeaxanthin or do not analyze serum
lutein and zeaxanthin concentrations separately. A second ob-
jective was to determine whether the changes in serum lutein and
zeaxanthin concentrations are associated with any of the var-
iables measured. A third objective was to determine whether egg
consumption in this elderly age group would result in signiﬁcant
increases in serum LDL-C concentrations as reported in younger
populations (22).

Subjects and Methods

Subjects. The effects of consuming 1 egg/d on serum lutein and
zeaxanthin concentrations, as well as serum lipid and lipoprotein
cholesterol concentrations, was examined in 33 subjects (7 men and 26
women) with a mean age of 79 y (range: 60–96 y) who were currently
not taking lutein and/or zeaxanthin supplements or cholesterol-lowering
medication and who spoke English comfortably. The baseline charac-
teristics of the study participants are described in Table 1. A total of 65
individuals were recruited for the study. Nineteen were excluded from
the study due to the onset of illness, death, or nonadherence to protocol.
In addition, the data from 13 other subjects who were identiﬁed (during
the baseline period) as having taken a lutein and/or zeaxanthin
supplement prior to baseline were also excluded from the ﬁnal data
analysis because their baseline values of lutein and zeaxanthin were 80%
greater than the remaining 33 participants not taking supplements. The
data from this group of 13 people who took supplemental lutein and/or
zeaxanthin were analyzed separately. Of the 33 participants that
completed the study, 22 were recruited from 4 nursing homes, and 11
were from 4 senior citizen centers of the Merrimack Valley and from the
University of Massachusetts faculty and staff in Lowell. All but one
subject (Asian or Paciﬁc Islander) were Caucasian. Twenty-nine of the 33

graduated from high school or college. Most of the subjects had been
diagnosed with at least 1 medical condition, including 22 subjects with
hypertension and 6 with diabetes. All subjects were interviewed at
baseline using a structured medical medication history and demographic
questionnaire. Blood pressure, height, and weight were recorded by a
registered nurse upon enrollment into the study. A Mini-Mental State
Examination (24) was administered by the registered nurse to each
subject to verify mental competence. A 7-d diet record was obtained
from each subject once during each of the 4 phases of the study. Nutrient
analysis was performed using EvaluEat, version 1.2 dietary analysis tool
(Pearson Education, Benjamin Cummings, 2004). Dietary intakes of
energy, protein, carbohydrate, dietary ﬁber, total fat, monounsaturated
fat, polyunsaturated fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, and percent energy
from protein, fat, carbohydrate, and alcohol were all assessed. The
protocol for the ethical treatment of human subjects was approved by the
University of Massachusetts Lowell Institutional Review Board and the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts, Executive Ofﬁce of Elder Affairs,
Elder Rights Review Committee, Boston, MA.

Experimental design. This 18-wk randomized, cross-over study
consisted of 4 phases. Phase I consisted of a 4-wk baseline period during
which 11 senior citizen center and university subjects were instructed to
limit their consumption of foods containing lutein and zeaxanthin and to
not eat eggs or high egg-content foods. In contrast, the intake of the
background diet and the intervention treatments (eggs or egg substitute)
of the 22 nursing home subjects were strictly controlled by the nursing
home staff. Phase II consisted of a 5-wk intervention period during which
subjects consumed either no egg or egg substitute (referred to as no egg)
or 1 egg/d in addition to their normal diet. Either a daily visit or phone
call to the nursing home facility or to the subject’s home by study
personnel were used to verify consumption of all interventions. Phase III
consisted of a 4-wk washout period similar to phase I. Phase IV consisted
of a 5-wk cross-over intervention period during which those subjects
who consumed the no-egg or egg-substitute regiment (referred to as no
egg) during phase II were switched to 1 egg/d in addition to their normal
diet. Those subjects who consumed 1 egg/d during phase II were
switched to the no egg or egg substitute in addition to their normal diet.

Analysis of serum lipids and lipoprotein cholesterol measure-
ments. During each phase, morning 12-h fasting blood samples were
collected from all subjects at wk 2 and wk 4 for phases I and III and wk 3
and wk 5 for phases II and IV. Serum was harvested after centrifugation
at 1500 3 g at 4°C for 20 min. Serum lipid and lipoprotein cholesterol
concentrations were measured using a Cobas Mira Plus Clinical
Chemistry Autoanalyzer. Serum total cholesterol (TC) (25) and triglyc-
eride (TG) (26) concentrations were measured enzymatically using
the Inﬁnity Cholesterol Reagent (procedure 401) and Triglyceride (GPO-
Trinder) Reagent (procedure 337) from Sigma Diagnostics (Sigma-
Aldrich). Serum HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) was measured using the EZ
HDL Cholesterol Reagent (procedure 354L, Sigma Diagnostics, Sigma-
Aldrich). The concentration of serum LDL-C was calculated via the
Friedewald equation. The accuracy and precision of the procedures used
for the measurements of serum TC, HDL-C, and TG were maintained by
participation in the Lipid Standardization Program of the Centers for
Disease Control and the National Heart, Blood, and Lung Institute
(Atlanta, GA).

Although the results of phases I, III, and the no-egg or egg-substitute
intervention of phases II and IV during randomization were not
statistically different, the period just before the 1 egg/d was used as the
no-egg treatment for comparison with the egg-eating phase. Therefore,
results for each subject are reported as egg vs. no egg for serum lutein,
zeaxanthin, and lipid and lipoprotein cholesterol concentration.

Analysis of serum lutein and zeaxanthin. Serum aliquots were
archived in sealed 1.0 mL cryovials and stored at 280°C for no .6 mo
before analysis of serum carotenoids, a duration that has shown carot-
enoids to remain stable (27). Lutein and zeaxanthin standards were
provided by Hoffman-La Roche. The internal standard was b-apo-
12#-carotenol-O-t-ethyl-oxime. Cholesterol esterase (sterol esterase, EC
3.1.1.13; Pseudomonus sp.) and triacylglycerol
lipase (EC 3.1.1.3;

Rhizopus) were obtained from Calbiochem. High performance liquid
chromatography (HPLC) grade solvents were used (Pharmco and Fisher
Chemical).

Serum samples (100 mL) were mixed with 900 mL of reagent,
containing 1 International Unit (IU) cholesterol esterase (Calbiochem)
and 160 IU triglyceride lipase (Calbiochem). The enzyme reagent was
prepared in a 0.1 mol/L sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, with 0.1%
Triton X100. Samples were prepared according to the procedures
described by Handelman et al. (27). Calibration was achieved by
carrying the standards through the entire protocol parallel to those of the
serum samples.

HPLC separation and quantiﬁcation of lutein and zeaxanthin were
carried out using a procedure adapted from Handelman et al. (27). This
HPLC assay separates the 2 carotenoids, lutein and zeaxanthin, which
were then identiﬁed and quantitated as distinct peaks in the chromato-
gram. Analyses were achieved using an Agilent model 1100 gradient
HPLC apparatus with diode array detection. The column used was a 300
mm 3 4.6 mm Adsorbosphere-HS C18 (20% carbon load) (Alltech) with
3 mm particle size coupled with an identically packed guard column. The
ﬂow rate was 1.0 mL/min. The initial mobile phase concentration was
80% acetonitrile:20% methanol:0.4% ammonium acetate (w:v), with a
step gradient at 20 min to 30% isopropanol, returning to initial conditions
at 40 min, and then ﬁnishing with an additional 20 min equilibration
period. The column temperature was maintained at 19.5°C.

Measurement of egg yolk cholesterol and carotenoid composi-
tion. For cholesterol analysis, commercial large white chicken eggs were
provided by the nursing home facilities or donated by the Aramark
Corporation, which is the food service entity for the University of
Massachusetts, Lowell. Initially, 12 randomly chosen egg yolks were
separated manually from the egg white and placed in a preweighed petri
dish to determine weight of yolk. Five hundred mL of yolk was added to
20 mL of buffer solution and vigorously mixed for 3 min. Two-hundred
mL of the yolk-buffer solution was collected and analyzed for cholesterol
content on the Cobas Mira Plus Clinical Chemistry Autoanalyzer using
the same methods described for the analysis of serum lipids and
lipoprotein cholesterol.

For carotenoid analyses from the same 12 eggs, 250 mL of yolk was
added to 20 mL 0.15 mol/L phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, with 1 mmol/L
EDTA and 0.25% Triton 3 100. For analysis, 200 mL of dilute yolk was
mixed with 0.8 mL distilled water, 1 mL 6 mol/L potassium hydroxide,
and 2 mL ethanol. After vigorous mixing, the mixture was heated at
60°C for 30 min to saponify the lipids and hydrolyze the carotenoid
esters. After saponiﬁcation, 60 mL of internal standard was added,
mixed, and extracted similarly to serum. For HPLC analysis, the
supernatant was collected, dried under N2, and redissolved in 60 mL
methanol and 25 mL was injected onto the HPLC.

Statistical analysis. Differences between the 4 phases were determined
by repeated measures 1-way ANOVA (SigmaStat, Jandel Scientiﬁc).
When differences were observed, a Student-Newman-Keuls test was
used. A paired t test was used to examine the effect of the egg vs. no-egg
phases on the different variables measured. All values were expressed as
means 6 SEM and signiﬁcance was set at P , 0.05. Pearson correlation
coefﬁcient was used to determine signiﬁcant associations among the
variables measured.

Power calculation indicated that a minimum size of 30 was needed to
detect a 5% change in LDL-C with a cross-over design at an error rate
(alpha) of 0.001 with a desired power (beta) of 80.

Results

Dietary analysis. Using the 7-d diet record for a 1-wk analysis
of dietary intake per phase, no signiﬁcant changes in dietary
intake between the nursing home and senior citizen center
subjects were observed despite the differences (free-living vs.
institutionalized) in the degree of background dietary control
(Table 2). The only macronutrient that increased was dietary
cholesterol during the egg intervention compared with the no-

egg/egg substitute period (P , 0.001). Although the diet analysis
database did not provide the carotenoid content of the various
foods, the frequency (number of times carotenoid-containing
foods were consumed each wk) did not differ during the egg
(10.9 6 1.8) vs. no-egg (11.1 6 2.0) interventions. These data
also showed that the background diet of the participants
consisted of only 5 carotenoid-containing foods (orange juice,
lettuce, yellow corn, broccoli, and onions) (28) and at mean
intakes of 113 g, contributed negligible amounts of dietary
carotenoids.

Egg yolk lutein, zeaxanthin, and cholesterol contents. The
cholesterol content for the 12 randomly sampled egg yolks was
210 6 9 mg/yolk (individual data not shown). Analyses of the
lutein and zeaxanthin content of the 12 egg yolks randomly
sampled were 143 6 28 and 94 6 18 mg/yolk, respectively
(individual data not shown).

Serum carotenoids and lipids. Serum lutein (Fig. 1A) and
zeaxanthin (Fig 1B) concentrations during the 4-wk phase prior
to consuming 1 egg/d increased 26 and 38%, respectively, by the
end of 5 wk of 1 egg/d intervention (P , 0.05).

Serum TC, LDL-C, HDL-C, and TG concentrations during

the no-egg and egg interventions did not differ. (Fig. 2).

Association between serum carotenoids, lipids, and lipo-
protein cholesterol. Serum lutein and zeaxanthin concentra-
tions during the no-egg and egg interventions were only
signiﬁcantly associated (r) with HDL-C (Table 3). However,
these correlations, although signiﬁcant, only explained #21% of
the variability (r2). Absent from the table are the elevated values
of serum lutein and zeaxanthin after egg consumption (r ¼
0.835, P , 0.001), which were associated with their values
before egg consumption (r ¼ 0.850, P , 0.001).

Discussion

There appear to be only 4 published studies that have used egg
yolks as a bioavailable source of the oxygenated carotenoids,
lutein and zeaxanthin. Three of these studies used carotenoid-
enriched eggs (21,29,30) and only 1 of these studies measured
lutein and zeaxanthin separately (22). In this present study,
consumption of 1 noncarotenoid-enriched egg/d for 5 wk
signiﬁcantly increased serum lutein and zeaxanthin concentra-
tions by 26 and 38%, respectively, in this population with a
mean age of 79 y consuming dietary egg yolk lutein and
zeaxanthin concentrations of 143 and 94 mg/yolk, respectively.

carotenoid responsiveness because men ingesting controlled
diets high in fruits and vegetables, and who had higher baseline
values of lutein, did not increase their serum concentrations of
lutein in response to increased dietary lutein. With the 13 people
in the present study who consumed supplements containing
lutein, baseline serum lutein concentrations (300 6 43 nmol/L)
were ;80% higher than the 33 individuals who had not con-
sumed supplements (167 6 16 nmol/L). Similar to the ﬁndings of
Yeum et al. (29), these 13 people did not show signiﬁcant serum
carotenoid increases in response to increased dietary lutein and
zeaxanthin after consuming 1 store-bought egg/d (data not
shown). Surprisingly, in the randomization process in which par-
ticipants did not consume eggs for up to 13 wk (4 wk baseline
1 5 wk of Egg Beaters 1 4 wk of washout) the baseline con-
centrations of serum lutein and zeaxanthin of the 13 individuals
taking supplements remained greater than individuals not on
supplements (286 6 40 nmol/L and 71 6 9 nmol/L vs. 210 6 21
nmol/L and 56 6 5 nmol/L). These ﬁndings suggest that 13 wk
of not taking supplemental
lutein and zeaxanthin is not a
sufﬁcient duration to reduce serum lutein and zeaxanthin to
previous concentrations. This may explain why participants
recruited into the study of Chung et al. (21) were required to stay
off of supplemental lutein for 6 mo. This observation, plus the
nonresponsive carotenoid ﬁndings of Yeum et al. (29) in in-
dividuals with high baseline lutein values, was the rationale for
analyzing separately the data from the 13 people who consumed
supplements prior to the baseline period in the present study. In
addition to baseline values of circulating carotenoids, it is also
possible that the concentrations of carotenoids consumed may
affect carotenoid responsiveness. In a study of individuals who
consumed designer eggs enriched with 1910 mg of lutein for 8
wk, plasma lutein concentrations increased 88% (240 to 450
nmol/L) (30). The .2-fold (88 vs. 26%) increase in plasma
lutein concentrations in the designer-egg study of Surai et al.
(30), compared with the present study, was probably associated
with the 12-fold greater concentrations (1910 mg/yolk vs. 143
mg/yolk) of lutein in the designer eggs than in the store-bought
eggs. The possibility that dietary fat may also inﬂuence serum
carotenoid concentration is suggested by the ﬁndings of Chung
et al. (21) in subjects that consumed comparable concentrations

when they consumed 1 egg/d for 5 wk and when they consumed no eggs or egg
substitute. Values are means 1 SEM, n ¼ 33. *Different from no egg, P , 0.001.

The degree of serum carotenoid responsiveness in this commu-
nication is similar to the study by Handelman et al. (22) in
subjects consuming 1.3 egg yolks/d but is not consistent with the
results from the study of Surai et al. (30) where only individuals
consuming the designer eggs (1910 mg of lutein/egg) and not the
control eggs (120 mg lutein/egg) increased their plasma lutein
concentrations. The reason for the discordant ﬁndings of Surai
et al. (30) compared with the studies of Handelman et al. (22)
and the present communication is not known. The studies of
Yeum et al. (29) suggest that baseline values may inﬂuence serum

of lutein in which a background diet, consisting of 60% of
energy from fat compared with 17% in the present communi-
cation, was associated with 11-fold greater increase in (323 vs.
26%) blood lutein concentrations. Their (21) dramatic increase
in plasma lutein concentrations may have also resulted from the
greater consumption of lutein (6 mg/d) compared with the
concentrations consumed (148 mg/d) in the present study. Other
factors that can inﬂuence the absorption of lutein and zeaxan-
thin include digestion of the food matrix, the formation of lipid
micelles, and uptake of the carotenoids by mucosal cells and
transport of the carotenoids to the lymphatic or portal circula-
tions (31). The substantial contribution that the digestibility of
the food matrix can make to absorption is suggested by the
studies of Chung et al. (21) in which lutein from eggs was nearly
3 times more bioavailable than spinach. Competition for
absorption from other carotenoids besides lutein and zeaxanthin
has also been suggested (31), a possibility that could not be
evaluated in the present study because other carotenoids were
not measured. It is also possible that a population’s response to
dietary lutein and zeaxanthin may be age dependent, although
the studies of Johnson et al. (18), in a population aged 33–54 y,
and Yeum et al. (29), in a population ranging in age from 20 to
80 y, did not report age-dependent differences in plasma lutein
response.

The ﬁnding that concentrations of serum lutein and zeaxan-
thin during the no-egg and egg interventions were associated
with serum HDL-C, is not unexpected, insofar as these oxygen-
ated carotenoids are predominantly transported in this lipopro-
tein fraction (32). Due to the small number of subjects (n ¼ 11)
compared with the current study (n ¼ 33), Handelman et al. (22)
were unable to determine whether the lutein concentration was
associated with any serum lipid measurements such as HDL-C.
In the current study, the carotenoid responsiveness is similar
to the ﬁndings of Handelman et al. (22), despite the differences
in the mean age of the study populations (62 vs. 79 y in the
current study), which suggests that age is not related to the
degree of diet responsiveness.

A difference between our study and the results of Handelman
et al. (22) concerning serum LDL-C changes (11 and 3.2%,
respectively), may be a result of the number of subjects in our
study (33) vs. the number (11) in the study by Handelman et al.
(22). Another possibility for the difference in serum LDL-C
response may be gender related, insofar as Handelman et al. (22)
had 54% males, vs. 21% males the current study.

Our results demonstrated that increases in serum lutein and
zeaxanthin concentrations were not signiﬁcantly associated with
a similar increase in serum lipids and lipoprotein cholesterol
concentrations in this population with a mean age of 79 y. The
actual 0.6 and 3.2% increase in serum TC and LDL-C
concentrations, respectively, is consistent with the meta-analysis
of studies of dietary cholesterol effects on plasma TC and LDL-C
conducted by Clarke et al. (33), Howell et al. (34), and
Weggemans et al. (35). Greene et al. (36) showed that dietary
cholesterol concentrations from consuming 3 eggs/d signiﬁcantly
increased plasma LDL-C and HDL-C in subjects 29–60 y of age,
and there were no signiﬁcant alterations in the ratios of LDL-C:
HDL-C or the TC:HDL-C, which is often associated with
increased atherogenicity. Our study did not ﬁnd signiﬁcant
increases in serum LDL-C or HDL-C, possibly because our
participants consumed only 1 egg/d. This may also be related to
the greater age of the population in this study. There are several
studies (37–39) that indicate serum LDL-C concentrations are
reduced in older populations, and, in one study, the suggested
mechanism may be reduced.

In conclusion, compared with the study of Handelman et al.
(22), our study demonstrated that consuming only 1 store-
bought egg/d in a population with a mean age of 79 y can
signiﬁcantly increase both serum lutein and zeaxanthin concen-
trations without elevating serum TC and LDL-C concentrations.
The study also revealed that the degree of carotenoid response in
an older population was similar to those reported for younger
populations (22), despite the fact that the work by Handelman
et al. (22) was a metabolic ward study (personal communica-
tion, Dr. Garry Handelman, University of Massachusetts,
Lowell), environmentally different from the relatively free-living
study reported here. Finally, this study showed a signiﬁcant
association between serum concentrations of carotenoids with
only HDL-C, a ﬁnding that could not be observed in the study of
Handelman et al. (22) with only 11 participants.

Summary
Background The association between intake of fruits, vegetables, and legumes with cardiovascular disease and deaths 
has been investigated extensively in Europe, the USA, Japan, and China, but little or no data are available from the 
Middle East, South America, Africa, or south Asia.

Methods We did a prospective cohort study (Prospective Urban Rural Epidemiology [PURE] in 135 335 individuals aged 
35 to 70 years without cardiovascular disease from 613 communities in 18 low-income, middle-income, and high-
income countries in seven geographical regions: North America and Europe, South America, the Middle East, south 
Asia, China, southeast Asia, and Africa. We documented their diet using country-specific food frequency questionnaires 
at baseline. Standardised questionnaires were used to collect information about demographic factors, socioeconomic 
status (education, income, and employment), lifestyle (smoking, physical activity, and alcohol intake), health history 
and medication use, and family history of cardiovascular disease. The follow-up period varied based on the date when 
recruitment began at each site or country. The main clinical outcomes were major cardiovascular disease (defined as 
death from cardiovascular causes and non-fatal myocardial infarction, stroke, and heart failure), fatal and non-fatal 
myocardial  infarction,  fatal  and  non-fatal  strokes,  cardiovascular  mortality,  non-cardiovascular  mortality,  and  total 
mortality. Cox frailty models with random effects were used to assess associations between fruit, vegetable, and legume 
consumption with risk of cardiovascular disease events and mortality.

Findings Participants were enrolled into the study between Jan 1, 2003, and March 31, 2013.  For the current analysis, we 
included all unrefuted outcome events in the PURE study database through March 31, 2017. Overall, combined mean 
fruit, vegetable and legume intake was 3·91 (SD 2·77) servings per day. During a median 7·4 years (5·5–9·3) of follow-
up,  4784  major  cardiovascular  disease  events,  1649  cardiovascular  deaths,  and  5796  total  deaths  were  documented. 
Higher total fruit, vegetable, and legume intake was inversely associated with major cardiovascular disease, myocardial 
infarction, cardiovascular mortality, non-cardiovascular mortality, and total mortality in the models adjusted for age, sex, 
and centre (random effect). The estimates were substantially attenuated in the multivariable adjusted models for major 
cardiovascular  disease  (hazard  ratio  [HR]  0·90,  95%  CI  0·74–1·10,  ptrend=0·1301),  myocardial  infarction  (0·99, 
0·74–1·31; ptrend=0·2033), stroke (0·92, 0·67–1·25; ptrend=0·7092), cardiovascular mortality (0·73, 0·53–1·02; ptrend=0·0568), 
non-cardiovascular mortality (0·84, 0·68–1·04; ptrend =0·0038), and total mortality (0·81, 0·68–0·96; ptrend<0·0001). The 
HR  for  total  mortality  was  lowest  for  three  to  four  servings  per  day  (0·78,  95%  CI  0·69–0·88)  compared  with  the 
reference group, with no further apparent decrease in HR with higher consumption. When examined separately, fruit 
intake was associated with lower risk of cardiovascular, non-cardiovascular, and total mortality, while legume intake was 
inversely associated with non-cardiovascular death and total mortality (in fully adjusted models). For vegetables, raw 
vegetable intake was strongly associated with a lower risk of total mortality, whereas cooked vegetable intake showed a 
modest benefit against mortality.

Interpretation Higher fruit, vegetable, and legume consumption was associated with a lower risk of non-cardiovascular, 
and  total  mortality.  Benefits  appear  to  be  maximum  for  both  non-cardiovascular  mortality  and  total  mortality  at 
three to four servings per day (equivalent to 375–500 g/day).

Introduction
Several guidelines recommend the consumption of five or 
more servings per day of fruits, vegetables, and legumes.1,2 

This  recommendation  is  largely  based  on  observational 
data from Europe and the USA and a few studies from 
Japan and China. Consumption of these foods is higher in

Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched PubMed for articles published between Jan 1, 1960, 
and May 1, 2017, using the terms “fruit” OR “vegetable” OR 
“legume” OR “dietary pulse” OR “produce” OR “food” OR “diet” 
AND “cardiovascular” OR “coronary heart disease” OR “ischemic” 
OR “myocardial” OR “stroke” OR “death” OR “mortality” OR 
“sudden cardiac death”. We used search terms in English but did 
not apply any language restrictions. We screened papers by title 
and abstract to identify full-text reports that were relevant to 
the study aims. We also screened citation lists for these full-text 
reports to identify other relevant articles. Articles were 
considered relevant if they reported the relation between fruit, 
vegetable, or legume intake and cardiovascular events or total 
mortality. Numerous prospective cohort studies have reported 
inverse associations between fruit, vegetable and legume intake 
and cardiovascular events and total mortality, but existing 
evidence was limited to studies predominantly from European 
countries, the USA, Japan, and China, with little data available 
from other regions of the world. Additionally, previous studies 
have shown that the consumption of fruits, vegetables, and 
legumes is low among many populations, predominantly those 
in countries outside Europe or the USA. It is unclear whether 
these food items are beneficially associated with cardiovascular 
risk in non-Western countries.

Europe  and  the  USA  than  other  populations3  and  little 
information  is  available  on  any  potential  associations  of 
lower levels of consumption of fruit and vegetables with 
cardiovascular disease or deaths outside European or US 
populations  (such  as  those  from  the  Middle  East, 
South America, Africa, and south Asia). Even in studies 
from Europe and the USA,4 the apparent benefits of fruit 
and  vegetable  consumption  vary  substantially  (from  as 
large  as  a  40%  relative  risk  reduction  to  no  benefit) 
depending on the outcome (myocardial infarction, stroke, 
or death), exposures reported (fruits, vegetables, or both), 
or the extent of statistical adjustment for other variables 
that  might  relate  to  cardiovascular  disease  or  death  (eg, 
other dietary variables or socioeconomic status). Moreover, 
mean  consumption  of  fruit  and  vegetables  in  most 
countries is lower than current recommendations,3,5 and 
partly because of the relative unaffordability of fruits and 
vegetables in poorer countries.5 Although fruits are mainly 
consumed fresh in most parts of the world, vegetables are 
eaten raw or cooked in Europe and the USA, and mostly 
cooked in Asia and in other parts of the world.

Currently, most dietary guidelines do not differentiate 
between  raw  and  cooked  vegetable  intake,  despite 
potential  differences  in  nutritional  composition  and 
digestibility.6,7 Therefore, guidelines that are largely based 
on European and US data might not necessarily apply to 
other regions of the world. In this study, we investigated 
the  association  of  fruit,  vegetable,  and  legume  con­
total 
sumption  with  cardiovascular  outcomes  and 

Added value of this study
In our analysis of 135 335 participants from 18 countries, we 
assessed relationships across a broad range of intakes 
including very low consumption of fruits and vegetables, and 
high consumption of legumes. To our knowledge, this is the 
only global study relating fruit, vegetable, and legume intake 
to cardiovascular disease events and mortality. The results 
showed that non-cardiovascular mortality and total mortality 
are decreased with high intake of fruits, vegetables, and 
legumes compared with low intake.

Implications of all the available evidence
Many dietary guidelines recommend a minimum of 
400 g/day of fruits and vegetables, which might not be 
achievable globally since fruits and vegetables have 
previously been shown to be unaffordable in low-income and 
lower-middle income countries. Our findings that even three 
servings per day (375 g/day) show similar benefit against the 
risk of non-cardiovascular and total mortality as higher 
intakes indicates that optimal health benefits can be achieved 
with a more modest level of consumption, an approach that 
is likely to be more affordable in poor countries.

from  seven  geographical  regions:  North  America  and 
Europe,  South  America,  the  Middle  East,  south  Asia, 
China,  southeast  Asia,  and  Africa.  This  allowed  us  to 
investigate relationships across a broad range of intakes 
including very low consumption of fruits and vegetables, 
and  high  consumption  of  legumes.  Additionally,  we 
examined the associations of raw and cooked vegetable 
intake independently from each other with cardiovascular 
disease events and total mortality.

validated food frequency questionnaires (FFQs).12–22 For 
countries  that had a previously validated FFQ (Canada, 
China,  India,  Malaysia,  South  Africa,  Sweden,  and 
Turkey) we used the nutrient databases that were used 
for the FFQ validation. For countries where a validated 
FFQ was not available, we developed and validated FFQs 
using a standard method (appendix p 9). To develop and

into  nutrients,  we 
constructed  country­specific  nutrient  databases  with 
information about 43 macronutrients and micronutrients 
that  were  mainly  based  on  the  US  Department  of 
Agriculture (USDA) food­composition database (release 
18 and 21), modified appropriately with reference to local 
food composition tables, and supplemented with recipes 
of locally eaten mixed dishes. The FFQ was administered 
to  the  same  subgroup  of  participants  in  each  country 
and  we  used  Pearson  correlation  coefficients,  using 
energy  adjusted  and  deattenuated  correlations,  and 
weighted κ to validate the FFQs measured against 24­h 
dietary recalls. Our validation studies showed reasonable 
agreement between the FFQs and 24­h recalls for fruits 
(rs =0·23–0·66)  and  vegetables  (rs =0·30–0·81)  and  the 
concordance  rates  of  classification  into  the  same 
quartiles ranged from 70% to 74% for fruit and 62% to 
79% for vegetables.

Potatoes, other tubers, and legumes were not included 
as vegetables. Fruit and vegetable juices were excluded.

Figure 1: Mean fruit, vegetable, and legume intake overall and by 
geographical region
Data are from 135 335 individuals. N Am/Eur=North America and Europe: 
Canada, Poland, and Sweden. S Amer=South America: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, 
and Colombia. Mid East=Middle East: Iran, occupied Palestinian territory, Turkey, 
and United Arab Emirates. S Asia=south Asia: Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan. 
SE Asia=southeast Asia: Malaysia. Africa=South Africa and Zimbabwe.

Legumes  included  beans,  black  beans,  lentils,  peas, 
chickpeas, and black­eyed peas. Because of inconsistent 
classification of legumes as a subset of vegetables,23,24 we 
grouped total fruit, vegetable, and legume intake into a 
single food group for our primary analysis (presented in 
this  report)  and  also  present  total  fruits  and  vegetables 
(without legumes) as a separate food group in a secondary 
analysis (appendix). Although many nutritional qualities 
of legumes differ from those of vegetables (eg, variable 
amounts  of  starch  and  energy),  both  legumes  and 
vegetables are good sources of plant protein, fibre, and 
isoflavones.23

We  used  standardised  questionnaires  to  obtain  infor­
mation about demographic factors, socioeconomic status 
(education, income, and employment), lifestyle (smoking, 
physical  activity,  and  alcohol  intake),  health  history  and 
medication  use,  and  family  history  of  cardiovascular 
disease.  Physical  assessments  included  standardised 
measurements of weight, height, waist and hip circum­
ferences,  and  blood  pressure.  Case­report  forms,  death 
certificates,  medical  records  and  verbal  autopsies  were 
used to capture data about major cardiovascular events, 
and  death  during  follow­up,  which  were  adjudicated 
centrally  in  each  country  by  trained  physicians  using 
predefined definitions. The follow­up varied based on the 
date  when  recruitment  began  at  each  site  or  country. 
During  the  follow­up,  contact  was  made  with  every 
participant at least every 3 years either by telephone or by 
a face­to­face visit by the local research team. The median 
duration of follow­up by country is in the appendix (p 6).

Outcomes
The  main  clinical  outcomes  were  major  cardiovascular 
disease (defined as death from cardiovascular causes and 
non­fatal myocardial infarction, stroke, and heart failure), 
fatal and non­fatal myocardial infarction, fatal and non­
fatal strokes, cardiovascular mortality, non­cardiovascular 
mortality, and total mortality.

Statistical analysis
We  computed  mean  and  median  estimated  fruit, 
vegetable, and legume intakes in servings overall and by 
geographical region. One serving was defined as 125 g of 
fruits  or  vegetables  and  150  g  of  cooked  legumes  in 
accordance with USDA serving sizes. Participants were 
grouped into categories based on intake values for each 
dietary  exposure  (ranging  from  servings  per  month  to 
servings per day depending on the dietary exposure). We 
calculated  hazard  ratios  (HR)  using  multivariable  Cox 
frailty analysis with random intercepts to account for the 
correlation  of  observations  within  centres 
(which 
therefore  also  accounted  for  clustering  at  region  and 
country  levels).  In  a  minimally  adjusted  model,  we 
adjusted for age, sex, and centre as a random effect. The 
primary  model  adjusted  for  age,  sex,  energy  intake, 
current smoking status, urban or rural location, physical 
activity,  baseline  diabetes,  education,  and  other  dietary 
variables (white meat, red meat, bread, and cereal intake), 
and study centre (as a random effect). For the analyses of 
fruit  intake,  we  adjusted  for  vegetable  intake,  and 
conversely, analyses of vegetable intake were adjusted for 
fruit intake. We adjusted for variations in socioeconomic 
status  using  education  level  and  household  income  or 
wealth  index;  these  produced  similar  results.  The 
primary analysis did not adjust for obesity, hypertension, 
or  hyper cholesterolaemia  because  these  factors  might 
mediate the effects of fruits, vegetables, and legumes on 
the risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality. We did 
separate analyses that adjusted for these factors (appendix 
pp  57–68)  and  the  results  were  largely  similar  to  the 
primary  model.  To  test  for  linear  trends,  categories  of 
fruit,  vegetable,  and  legume  intake  were  replaced  with 
continuous intake in the Cox frailty regression models. 
We did interaction tests for fruit, vegetable, and legume 
intake, and geographical region. Data were analysed with 
SAS version 9.4.

Role of the funding sources
The funders of the study had no role in study design, data 
collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of 
the  report.  The  corresponding  author  (VMi),  senior 
authors  (SA  and  SY),  and  several  co­authors  (AM,  XZ) 
had full access to all the data in the study and had final 
responsibility for the decision to submit for publication.

Total number of participants is 135 335. Data are n (%) or hazard ratio (95% CI) except where otherwise stated. Crude event rates are shown. For this analysis, the group with intake <1 serving per day was used 
as the reference (ref) group that all other groups were compared with. Additional sensitivity analyses with waist-to-hip ratio, hypertension status, and statin medication used in the model did not substantially 
change estimates of association (appendix). NA=not applicable. Major cardiovascular disease events=death from cardiovascular causes and non-fatal myocardial infarction, stroke, and heart failure. 
Multivariable adjusted=adjusted for age, sex, centre (random effect), energy intake, current smoker, diabetes, urban or rural location, physical activity, education level, and tertiles of white meat, red meat, 
breads, and cereals intake.

plausible energy intake (500–5000 kcal/day) and were not 
missing information about their age and sex. We excluded 
7369  people  with  a  history  of  cardiovascular  disease  at 
baseline and 1230 people for whom follow­ up information 
was not available. The remaining 135 335 individuals were 
included in this analysis (appendix p 7). For the current 
analysis, we included all unrefuted outcome events in the 
PURE study database through March 31, 2017.

People  who  consumed  more  fruits,  vegetables,  and 
legumes had higher education, higher levels of physical 
activity,  lower  rates  of  smoking,  and  higher  energy,  red 
meat and white meat intake, and were more likely to live 
in  urban  areas  (table  1).  Overall,  mean  fruit,  vegetable, 

and legume intakes were 1·51 (SD 1·77), 2·01 (1·55), and 
0·40  (0·48)  servings  per  day,  respectively.  Combined 
mean fruit, vegetable, and legume intake was 3·91 (2·77) 
servings per day (figure 1).

During a median follow­up of 7·4 years (IQR 5·5–9·3), 
there  were  4784  major  cardiovascular  disease  events 
re corded  (table  2).  Higher  total  fruit,  vegetable,  and 
legume  intake  was  inversely  associated  with  major 
cardiovascular  disease,  myocardial  infarction,  cardio­
vascular  mortality,  non­cardiovascular  mortality,  and 
total mortality in the models adjusted for age, sex, and 
centre

and tertiles of white meat, red meat, and intake of breads, cereals, and vegetables. Crude event rates are shown. Additional sensitivity analyses with waist-to-hip ratio, hypertension status, and statin 
medication used in the model did not substantially change estimates of association (appendix). HR=hazard ratio. Major cardiovascular disease events=death from cardiovascular causes and non-fatal 
myocardial infarction, stroke, and heart failure. 

markedly  attenuated  and  only  non­cardiovascular 
mortality and total mortality remained significant, with 
a  non­signifi cant  trend  for  cardiovascular  mortality 
(table 2). The HR for total mortality was lowest for three 
to  four  servings  per  day  (0·78,  95%  CI  0·69–0·88) 
compared  with  the  reference  group,  with  no  further 
apparent  decrease  in  HR  with  higher  consumption. 
Total fruit, vegetable, and legume intake was inversely 
associated  with  total  mor tality  in  most  geographical 

regions (south Asia, China, North America and Europe, 
the  Middle  East,  and  South  America;  appendix 
pp 35–36). Similarly, total fruit and vegetable intake was 
associated  with  major 
disease, 
myocardial  infarction,    cardiovascular  mortality,  non­
cardiovascular mortality and total mortality in the age­
adjusted  and  sex­adjusted  models,  and  with  lower 
non­cardiovascular  mortality  and  total  mortality  in  the 
fully adjusted models.

Figure 3: Association of vegetable intake with cardiovascular outcomes and mortality
(A) Adjusted for age, sex, and centre (random effect). (B) Adjusted for age, sex, centre (random effect), energy intake, current smoker, diabetes, urban/rural location, physical activity, education level, and 
tertiles of white meat, red meat, and intake of breads, cereals, and fruit. Crude event rates are shown. Additional sensitivity analyses with waist-to-hip ratio, hypertension status, and statin medication 
used in the model did not substantially change estimates of association (appendix). HR=hazard ratio. Major cardiovascular disease events=death from cardiovascular causes and nonfatal myocardial 
infarction, stroke, and heart failure. 

After adjusting for age and sex, fruit consumption was 
inversely associated with the risk of major cardiovascular 
disease,  stroke,  cardiovascular  mortality,  non­cardio­
vascular  mortality,  and  total  mortality  (figure  2).  The 
associations  were  markedly  attenuated  after  adjusting 
for  additional  lifestyle  and  dietary  factors  and  only 
cardiovascular  mortality,  non­cardiovascular  mortality, 
and  total  mortality  remained  significant  (figure  2).  An 
inverse association between higher fruit intake and the 
risk of total mortality was observed in south Asia, China, 
the  Middle  East,  and  South  America 
(appendix 
pp 37–38).

In the age­adjusted and sex­adjusted models, vegetable 
inversely  associated  with  cardiovascular 
intake  was 
mortality, non­cardiovascular mortality, and total mortality 

(figure  3).  After  adjustment  for  additional  covariates, 
vegetable intake was not significantly associated with these 
outcomes  (figure  3).  Similarly,  no  significant  association 
was observed between vegetable intake and total mortality 
in  most  geographical  regions  (China,  southeast  Asia, 
Africa,  the  Middle  East,  and  South  America),  but  a 
beneficial association was shown in south Asia, and North 
America and Europe (appendix pp 39–40).

Legume  consumption  was  inversely  associated  with 
cardiovascular  mortality,  non­cardiovascular  mortality, 
and total mortality in the minimally adjusted models and 
with non­cardiovascular mortality and total mortality in 
the fully adjusted models (figure 4).

The  percentage  of  total  vegetable  intake  consumed  as 
raw vegetables was low in south Asia, Africa, and southeast

Asia  (figure  5).  In  the  fully  adjusted  models,  both  raw 
and  cooked  vegetable  intakes  were  inversely  associated 
with total mortality (tables 3, 4). The risk of major cardio­
vascular disease was inversely associated with the level of 
raw  vegetable  intake,  but  not  cooked  vegetable  intake 
(tables 3, 4). A non­significant inverse trend for the level of 
raw  vegetable  intake  and  risk  of  major  cardiovascular 
disease  was  observed,  but  no  association  was  shown  for 
cooked vegetable intake.

Discussion
In  this  large,  international  prospective  cohort  study,  we 
showed  that  greater  fruit,  vegetable,  and  legume  intake 
was associated with a lower risk of major cardiovascular 
disease,  myocardial  infarction,  cardiovascular  mortality, 
non­cardiovascular  mortality,  and  total  mortality  in  the 
analyses  adjusted  for  age  and  sex.  With  multivariable 
adjustment (demographic characteristics, lifestyle, health 
history,  and  dietary  factors),  the  associations  remained 

2044

Articlessignificant  for  non­cardiovascular  mortality  and  total 
mortality,  with  a  non­significant  trend  for  lower  cardio­
vascular mortality. Furthermore, an intake of three to four 
servings  per  day  (equivalent  to  375–500  g/day)  was  as 
beneficial  as  higher  amounts  of  intake  in  reducing  total 
mortality.  Our  findings  indicate  that  even  relatively 
moderate intakes of fruits, vegetables and legumes might 
lower  the  risk  of  death.  A  meta­analysis4  reported  the 
steepest reduction in risk of total mortality with up to 400 g 
of fruits and vegetables per day (equivalent to 3·2 servings 
in  our  study),  with  modest  additional  benefit  for  intake 
above this level (relative risk [RR] 0·76, 95% CI 0·73–0·79 
for  400  g/day  and  RR  0·69,  0·66–0·73  for  800  g/day), 
which is consistent with our findings.

We showed an 11% lower risk of major cardiovascular 
disease  for  the  highest  fruit  intake  category  compared 
with  the  lowest  intake  category.  Our  findings  are  con­
sistent with those from a meta­analysis4 which showed a 
beneficial  effect  (RR  0·87,  95%  CI  0·82–0·92)  for  the 
prevention of cardiovascular disease. Our results suggest 
a  more  modest  effect  on  stroke  than  some,  but  not  all, 
previous  studies.4,25  Fewer  studies  have  investigated  the 
association  between  fruit  intake  and  stroke  compared 
with cardiovascular disease or coronary heart disease. Not 
all  studies  of  cardiovascular  disease  reported  on  both 
stroke and myocardial infarction, and some reported on 
only one outcome. This might be partly due to the varying 
goals of different studies, but could also be due to a data­
derived  emphasis  about  which  outcome  to  report  (with 
the  potential  that  the  outcome  and  exposure  with  the 
greater effect size might have been selectively reported or 
emphasised). Among studies with a similar range of fruit 
intake  as  our  PURE  study,  most  reported  a  nominal 
reduction  in  the  risk  of  stroke  including  the  Health 
Professionals Follow­up study,26 the Monitoring Project on 
Risk  Factors  and  Chronic  Diseases  in  the  Netherlands 
study,7  and  the  Multiethnic  Cohort  study.27  Our  findings 
for fruit and cardiovascular mortality and total mortality 
are in keeping with results from most previous prospective 
studies.4,25 We showed a 14% and 21% lower risk of these 
outcomes  when  one  to  two  daily  servings  (equivalent  to 
125–250 g/day) of fruit were consumed, and intake above 
this level had little added benefit on risk lowering.

Our finding of a minimal decrease in the risk of major 
cardiovascular  disease  and  total  mortality  with  higher 
vegetable intake is consistent with many earlier studies, 
although  substantial  heterogeneity  in  the  results  of 
different  studies  has  been  reported  in  a  meta­analysis;4 
and, only three of the 18 cohorts included in the meta­
analysis  reported  a  robust,  inverse  association  between 
vegetable  intake  and  cardiovascular  disease.28–30  Among 
studies with similar daily vegetable intake to the PURE 
study,  the  effect  estimates  for  cardiovascular  disease, 
stroke,  and  total  mortality  were  similar  to  those  in  our 
study.26–32  Collectively,  these  data 
indicate  that  the 
association of total vegetable intake and these outcomes 
is much more modest than generally assumed.

Figure 5: Mean raw and cooked vegetable intake overall and by geographical 
region
Data are from 93 183 participants, not including those from China (n=42 152) 
because the food frequency questionnaires used in this country did not 
differentiate between raw and cooked vegetables. N Am/Eur=North America and 
Europe: Canada, Poland, and Sweden. S Amer=South America: Argentina, Brazil, 
Chile, and Colombia. Mid East=Middle East: Iran, occupied Palestinian territory, 
Turkey, and United Arab Emirates. S Asia=south Asia: Bangladesh, India, and 
Pakistan. SE Asia=southeast Asia: Malaysia. Africa=South Africa and Zimbabwe.

Vegetables might be consumed raw or cooked and the 
cooking  process  might  alter  the  bioavailability  of 
nutrients  (such  as  phytochemicals,  vitamins,  minerals, 
and fibre), and digestibility. Some evidence suggests that 
cooking  vegetables  can  degrade  nutrient  and  enzyme 
content  and  possibly  create  harmful  byproducts.33 
However,  for  some  nutrients  such  as  lycopene  and 
β  carotene,  their  bioavailability  might  be  enhanced  by 
cooking.34,35 Little information is available on the effect of 
raw vegetable intake on cardiovascular disease and total 
mortality  in  low­income  and  middle­income  countries. 
In  a  cohort  of  451 151  participants  from  ten  European 
countries,31 both raw and cooked vegetable intakes were 
inversely associated with risk of mortality, but a stronger 
beneficial  effect  was  noted  for  raw  vegetable  con­
sumption.  Additionally,  beneficial  associations  of  raw 
vegetable  intake  with  total  mortality,  ischaemic  heart 
disease,36 and ischaemic stroke7 have been reported. Our 
findings of a trend towards greater beneficial associations 
for raw vegetable intake and major cardiovascular disease 
and  total  mortality  are  consistent  with  some  previous 
reports,31  but  differ  from  a  meta­analysis  that  showed 
similar  beneficial  effects  for  raw  and  cooked  vegetable 
intake  and  the  risk  of  mortality  (RR  0·88,  95%  CI 
0·79–0·98  for  raw  vegetables  and  0·87,  0·80–0·94  for 
cooked).4 However, a key limitation of this meta­analysis 
was that few studies examined raw and cooked vegetable 
intakes separately within the same study, which can lead 
to additional confounding (two studies on both raw and 
cooked vegetables and three on cooked vegetables only).

We  found  that  higher  legume  consumption  was 
associated  with  a  lower  risk  of  major  cardiovascular 
disease,  cardiovascular  mortality,  non­cardiovascular 
mortality  and  total  mortality,  although  only  the  associ­
ations  with  non­cardiovascular  mortality  and  total

Table 4: Association of cooked vegetable intake with cardiovascular disease and mortality

mortality were significant after full adjustment. A meta­
analysis showed that legume consumption reduced the 
risk of ischaemic heart disease, but not stroke.37 However, 
this  meta­analysis  included  data  from  only  six  cohorts, 
predominantly in North America and Europe, with little 
data from other regions. Furthermore, the consumption 
of  legumes  was  low  in  these  studies  (eg,  <25  g/day) 
compared with our study (overall mean legume intake of 
60 g/day). Legumes contribute a substantial amount of 
energy and protein for many populations in south Asia, 
Africa, and Latin America,38 which are included in PURE. 
In  Costa  Rica,  higher  legume  intake  (>86  g/day  vs 
<86  g/month)  was  associated  with  a  38%  lower  risk  of 
myocardial  infarction,39  which  is  consistent  with  our 

findings.  Legumes  are  frequently  consumed  as  an 
alternative  to  meat,  and  higher  glycaemic  grains  and 
starches  (eg,  pasta  and  white  bread),  and  might  be 
beneficial as a replacement for these foods.37,40,41 Overall, 
our findings suggest that higher legume consumption is 
associated with lower mortality in populations.

Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the 
lower  risk  of  cardiovascular  disease  with  higher  con­
sumption  of  fruits,  vegetables,  and  legumes.  One  ex­
planation  is  that  antioxidants  and  polyphenols  in  fruits 
and  vegetables,  such  as  vitamin  C,  vitamin  E,  and 
carotenoids, might prevent lipid oxidation in arterial vessel 
walls,42  lower  blood  pressure,43,44  and  improve  endo­
thelial  function.45  Several  studies  have  reported  inverse

Our  study  included  data  from  geographical  regions 
such  as  the  Middle  East,  South  America,  Africa, 
south  Asia,  and  southeast  Asia  from  which  little  or  no 
data  are  available  on  the  associations  between  fruits, 
vegetables, and legume intake and cardiovascular disease 
or deaths. Additional strengths of this study included the 
prospective  design,  the  large  sample  size,  the  use  of 
validated,  country­specific  FFQs  to  estimate  intake,  the 
broad range of intake of fruits, vegetables, and legumes 
(0 to >1000 g/day), and standardised methods to collect 
and  adjudicate  events.  Our  study  also  had  some 
limitations.  First, 
legume 
consumption  was  measured  using  validated  country­
specific  FFQs  at  baseline  and  their  consumption  was 
to  remain  unchanged  during  follow­up. 
assumed 
Consequently, measurement errors might have occurred 
that would probably have resulted in an underestimation 
of  the  relationship  between  dietary  intake  and  cardio­
vascular  disease  and  mortality.  Second,  we  did  not 
examine the associations of the different types of fruits 
and  vegetables  versus  cardiovascular  disease  or  mor­
tality;  the  power  to  detect  these  associations  was  low 
since  such  data  were  not  available  from  China  (which 
removed  about  40%  of  the  study  population),  and  the 
numbers of events per type of fruits and vegetables was 
relatively 
there  were  additional 
confounders  as  the  consumption  of  different  types  of 
vegetables  and  fruits  varied  by  region,  and  those 
consuming low amounts of one vegetable or fruit might 
have  consumed  large  amounts  of  another  fruit  or 
vegetable.  Controlling  for  such  factors  requires  even 
more  events  and  therefore  the  current  results  are  not 
robust.  Third,  environmental  factors  (use  of  pesticides 
and  herbicides,  and  water  contamination)  that  might 
affect  the  nutritional  quality  of  fruits,  vegetables,  and 
legumes were not measured and might have contributed 
to  the  differences  between  our  study  and  previous 
studies. Fourth, the methods of cultivation, types of fruits 
and  vegetables  commonly  consumed,  and  cooking 
methods (eg, frying vs other methods) might have varied 
across  countries.  Fifth,  in  observational  studies,  the 
possibility of residual confounding from unmeasured or 
imprecise  measurement  of  covariates  cannot  be 
completely  ruled  out.  This  is  exemplified  by  the 
near halving of apparent associations in the fully adjusted 
model compared with the minimally adjusted model, and 
suggests that part of the apparent large benefits in some 
previous  studies  might  have  been  due  to  incomplete 
adjustment.  Sixth,  some  event  misclassification  cannot 

low.  Furthermore, 

be  ruled  out.  However,  the  number  of  misclassified 
events  was  probably  minimal,  as  most  events  were 
ascertained using supporting documents and adjudicated 
using standardised defi nitions. Last, because of the low 
number  of  events  in  some  geographical  regions,  our 
findings  within  the  geographical  regions  of  the  Middle 
East, Southeast Asia, and North America and Europe are 
presently not robust. However, we intend to re­examine 
these relationships in the future when more participants 
have  been  enrolled  (the  study  has  now  nearly  enrolled 
200 000  people)  and  longer  follow­up  will  be  available. 
Nevertheless, to our know ledge, this is the first study to 
report on the associations of fruit, vegetable, and legume 
intake  with  cardiovascular  risk  in  countries  at  varying 
economic levels and from different regions.

trends 

intakes  and 

towards  benefit 

In  summary,  our  results  show  that  higher  fruit, 
vegetable, and legume intake is associated with a lower 
risk of non­cardiovascular mortality and total mortality, 
with a non­significant trend for cardiovascular mortality, 
in  a  global  population.  Previous  research4  and  many 
dietary  guidelines  in  North  America  and  Europe2 
recommended  intake  rang ing  from  400  to  800  g/day, 
but these targets are unaffordable for most individuals 
in  LIC  and  LMIC.5  Even  a  small  reduction  in  the 
recommendation  from  400  to  375  g/day  may  have 
important  implications  on  household  spending  and 
food  security  in  poorer  countries.  Our  findings  that 
even  three  servings  per  day  (375  g/day)  show  similar 
benefit against non­cardiovascular and total mortality as 
higher 
for 
cardiovascular  mortality,  indicate  that  optimal  health 
benefits  can  be  achieved  with  a  more  modest  level  of 
consumption,  an  approach  that  is  likely  to  be  much 
more affordable.

prevention of coronary heart disease

Summary
In  a  prospective,  randomised  single-blinded  secondary
prevention trial  we compared the effect of a Mediterranean
alpha-linolenic acid-rich diet to the usual post-infarct prudent
diet.

After a first myocardial infarction, patients were randomly
assigned  to  the  experimental  (n=302)  or  control  group
(n=303).  Patients  were  seen  again  8  weeks  after
randomisation, and each year for 5 years. The experimental
group  consumed  significantly  less  lipids,  saturated  fat,
cholesterol, and linoleic acid but more oleic and alpha-linolenic
acids confirmed by measurements in  plasma. Serum lipids,
blood pressure, and body mass index remained similar in the 2
groups. In the experimental group, plasma levels of albumin,
vitamin E, and vitamin C were increased, and granulocyte count
decreased. After a mean follow up of 27 months, there were 16
cardiac deaths in the control and 3 in the experimental group;
17 non-fatal myocardial infarction in the control and 5 in the
experimental groups: a risk ratio for these two main endpoints
combined of  0&middot;27  (95% Cl  0&middot;12-0&middot;59,  p=0&middot;001)  after
adjustment for prognostic variables. Overall mortality was 20
in the control, 8 in the experimental group, an adjusted risk
ratio of 0&middot;30  (95% Cl 0&middot;11-0&middot;82,  p=0&middot;02).

An alpha-linolenic acid-rich Mediterranean diet seems to be
more efficient  than  presently used  diets  in  the secondary
prevention of coronary events and death.

Introduction
Previous trials of diet modification to prevent recurrence
after a first myocardial infarction did not show the results
that  could  have  been  expected  from  epidemiological
studies.1 Among three main studies,2-4 only the Oslo trial2
reported a significant reduction of 23% in coronary events
but no improvement in survival. In these trials2,4 in order to
lower serum cholesterol,  the intake of saturated fat  was
decreased and that of polyunsaturated fat increased. Even
in primary prevention with a diet rich in polyunsaturated
(P)  and low in saturated (S)  fat (P/S,  1-6),  the rates  of
coronary events and deaths were not decreased.5 In another
trial-the diet and reinfarction trial (DART)-it was only
when intake of n-3 fatty acids (fish or oil) was increased that
mortality was reduced. 6

We have reported  that  a  dietary  polyunsaturated  to
saturated fat ratio more than 1,  even if associated with a
decrease  in  plasma  cholesterol,  enhanced  platelet
aggregation  to  adenosine  diphosphate.  High  platelet
aggregation is  associated with myocardial infarction and
closely  predicts  coronary  events.9  In  addition,  a  high
concentration  of linoleic  acid  could  be associated  with
increased  lipid  peroxidation1O  and  platelet-induced
aggregation. 7

In the present trial of diet to reduce cardiac mortality and
morbidity after myocardial infarction, we adapted a diet
associated with a low mortality rate from coronary heart
disease and all causes in the Seven Country Study." The
Cretan  Mediterranean  diet  includes  a  high  intake  of
alpha-linolenic acid (the precursor of n-3 long chain fatty
acids), known for its beneficial effect on platelet reactivity. 12
Being rich in vegetables and fruits, the diet also supplied a
high intake of antioxidants.

Methods
Design
The Lyon  Diet  Heart  Study  is  a  prospective,  randomised,
single-blinded, 
within  Lyon
Cardiovascular Hospital),  secondary prevention trial  aimed at
reducing the risk of cardiovascular deaths by diet modification and
recurrent myocardial infarction in survivors of a first myocardial
infarction. The protocol was approved by the Ethical Committee of
the Institut National de la  Sante et  de la  Recherche Medicare
(INSERM). An independent Scientific Committee met every two
years to advise the investigators on all  aspects of the trial.  The
randomisation  list  was  kept  confidentially  at  INSERM and
consulted  by phone for  each patient  enrolled.  Assignment of
patients were not known by the attending physicians. Mortality
and morbidity  outcomes  were  validated  and classified  by  an
independent Committee that worked only on the blinded data from
hospital  files  concerning  outcomes  which  involved  hospital
admission.

Patients
Patients of both sexes,  less  than 70 years old,  who survived a
myocardial infarction within 6 months of enrolment were eligible.
Exclusion criteria included heart failure (stage III and IV of the
New York  Heart  Association  functional  class),  hypertension

(systolic  >  180 mm Hg, diastolic  >  110 mm Hg), and inability to
complete  an exercise  test  due to  recurrent angina, ventricular
arrhythmias, or atrioventricular block. Among patients who had
coronary angioplasty or bypass, only those who were clinically
stable were entered. Patients were also excluded if they had any
other conditions thought to limit survival or ability to participate in
a long-term trial.

Inclusion of patients was according to a modification of Zelen’s
design.3 During hospital stay, patients were asked to participate in a
cohort study with a follow-up of 5 years and to sign a first informed
consent.  To  avoid  between-group  contamination,  with  the
approval of the Ethical and Scientific Committees, patients were
not fully  informed of the design of the study, especially of the
comparison between two diets. To be included in the study, they
had to come to the outpatient clinic, 2 weeks after discharge, and be
randomised. Patients assigned to the experimental group had to
sign a second informed consent in which they agreed to modify
their diets.

Sample size and recruitment
Sample size was calculated assuming an annual recurrence rate of
8% in the control group, 4% in the experimental group, and 4%
annual loss to follow-up in both groups. For a power of 90%, with a
two-sided test and a 5% type 1 error, 250 patients (125 patients per
group per year) would be required in each group with a follow-up
of 5 years after 2 years of recruitment.

However, after one year of recruitment and follow-up, both the
accrual  rate  and  recurrence  rate  were  lower  than  expected.
Assuming an annual recurrence rate of 5-3% in the control and
2’65% in the experimental groups, the number of subjects to be
recruited was 300 per group over 4 years with a minimum follow-up
of 2 years. Consequently, enrolment which began in March, 1988,
was ended in March, 1992. An intermediate analysis was proposed
by the Scientific Committee in March, 1993, after a minimum
follow-up of one year, assuming a type 1  error of 3%, to ensure a
total 5% error at final analysis, in 1994. In the case of a statistically
significant result at the intermediate analysis, the trial would be
stopped. This publication results from that decision being made.
The trial was stopped after the intermediate analysis.

invasive  and  non-invasive 

At all  visits,  a  systematic  interview  was  conducted by the
research cardiologist concerning new hospital admissions, drug
treatment  changes, 
cardiac
investigations, exercise tolerance, angina, and arrhythmia. Blood
pressure  was measured by  an automatic  sphygmomanometer.
Blood  samples  for  routine  biochemical  and  haematological
determinations and for platelet aggregation studies were done as
previously  described. is  Plasma  total  lipid  fatty  acids  were
measured by gas-liquid chromatography16 but with a capillary
column. Plasma vitamin C was measured by colorimetry, 17 and
vitamins A and E by high-performance liquid chromatography.’8
For the first 4 years, dietary habits were evaluated only in the
experimental group so as not to influence the behaviour of controls.
Nevertheless, the diet of 192 consecutive controls was evaluated
once, starting in June, 1992.

Clinical endpoints
Primary endpoints were death from cardiovascular causes and
non-fatal  acute  myocardial  infarction.  Subsidiary  endpoints
included non-cardiac deaths  (evaluated  in  patients  withdrawn
from follow up by contacts with the family or birth-place city halls)
and the following conditions, providing they required hospital
admission: unstable angina, postinfarct recurrent stable angina,
heart failure (stage III and IV of the New York Heart Association),
stroke, pulmonary embolism, peripheral embolism, and venous

Diet intervention
To avoid between-group contamination, control patients received
no dietary advice apart from that of hospital dieticians or attending
physicians. Patients in the experimental group were advised by the
research  cardiologist  and  dietician,  during  a  one-hour-long
session, to adopt a Mediterranean-type diet: more bread, more root
vegetables and green vegetables, more fish, less meat (beef, lamb,
and pork to be replaced with poultry), no day without fruit, and
butter and cream to be replaced with margarine supplied by the
study.

Because the patients would not accept olive oil-traditional to
the  Mediterranean  diet-as  the  only  fat,  a  rapeseed  (canola)
oil-based margarine (Astra-Calve, Paris, France) was supplied free
for the whole family to all experimental subjects. This margarine
had a composition comparable to olive oil with 15 % saturated fatty
acids, 48% oleic acid but 5-4% 18:1 trans. However, it was slightly
higher in linoleic (16-4 vs 8-6%) and more so in alpha-linolenic acid
(4-8 vs 0-6%), a fatty acid markedly higher (3 fold) in the plasma of
the Cretan cohort in the Seven Country study compared to that of
Zutphen (Netherlands).14

The oils  recommended for salads and food preparation were
rapeseed and olive oils exclusively. Moderate alcohol consumption
in the form of wine was allowed at meals. At each subsequent visit
of  the  experimental  patients,  a  dietary  survey  and  further
counselling were done by the research dietician. Diet evaluations
comprised a 24-hour recall and a frequency questionnaire.

Initial examination and follow-up
Acute-phase data on myocardial infarction  were recorded from
hospital  files.  After  the  randomisation  visit  where  baseline
characteristics  were  recorded,  patients  of  both  groups  were
scheduled to be seen 8 weeks later and then annually.

thrombophlebitis. Recurrent myocardial infarction was defined as
prolonged  chest  pain  with  characteristic  electrocardiographic
changes and/or increases in creatine kinase to more than two times
the upper limit of normal, and/or the presence of positive results of
specific myocardial isoform. Cardiovascular death included death
occurring  during  the  course  of  a  suspected  or  confirmed
myocardial infarction, sudden death, unwitnessed death, and death
occurring during the course of episodes of heart failure. Patients
who had cardiac transplant or cardiomyoplasty were classified by
the Validation and Classification Committee as cardiac death as in
the  Pfeffer  et  al  captopril  trial.19  Coronary  bypass  surgery,
angioplasty, and their complications were considered as secondary
endpoints.

All endpoints were ascertained  at  the annual visit.  Detailed
information on the clinical event and its evolution was obtained
from the family and medical and hospital  records.  Data were
reviewed blindly and classified by the Validation and Classification
Committee according to predefined criteria.

Controls for bias
Since  the study  was single  blinded,  bias  could result  from a
beneficial placebo effect in the group with dietary counselling. A
designed  and  analysed  by  independent
questionnaire 
psychosociologists (manuscript in preparation) indicates that there
was  no  significant  difference  between  the  2  groups  in  their
perceptions of clinic visits-judgments on the staff; consultation
discussions on drug use, suffering, job, family life, anxiety, and
physical problems-except for dietary habits.

Analysis
Analyses  were  done  on  the  intention-to-treat  principle.
Differences  between  groups  were  evaluated  by X2  tests  for
categorical variables and unpaired student’s t-tests for continuous
variables  (two-sided  tests).  In  life-table  analyses,  the  date of
randomisation was used as the starting point and the date of any
event as the endpoint. In combined analyses, the time of the first
event was used. Kaplan Meier estimates of the probabilities of
survival and Rothman 95% confidence limits were computed to
make the survival curves which were compared by log rank test.
Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate the risk ratio
of events before and after controlling for prognostic variables.

Results
Patient accrual, eligibility, and follow-up
Enrolment was from March, 1988 to March, 1992.  679
patients were contacted in hospital; 71 refused to participate
and  3  were  considered  ineligible.  Shortly  after
randomisation,  21  (8  in  the  controls  and  13  in  the
experimental group refused follow-up) (table 1). Refusals
were  included  only  in  the  total  mortality  analysis.
Consequently, the cardiovascular morbidity and detailed
mortality analyses were on 584 randomised patients; 289 in
the experimental and 295 in the control group. Among these
584 patients, the mean rate of withdrawal from follow-up
(did not attend two consecutive appointments) was similar
in the experimental (8-0%) and control (7-0%) groups, as
was the length of time until withdrawal (mean [standard
deviation]) 8 (9) vs 7 (9) months. 11 patients in the control
and 10 in the experimental group missed only one visit and
were not withdrawn. 2 in the experimental group reported
margarine-related  side-effects:  one with  colitis  and one
with diarrhoea.

Survivors free from myocardial infarction were followed
for 27 1 (15) months in the control and 26-9 (15) months in
the experimental group. At the time of this report the vital
status of 3 controls is unknown.

Table 7: Endpoints In the two groups over 27 months mean follow-up

Baseline characteristics
Patients  were  mostly  male  (table  2).  There  was  no
difference in sex ratio, body mass index, blood pressure,
or  other  features  between  randomised  patients.
Characteristics of patients who withdrew were also similar
to those of the whole group-there is no major selection bias
in this study.

Dietary intervention
At randomisation, the diet of the experimental group (table
3) was assumed to be that of controls, ie, close to the prudent
diet of the American Heart Association (total lipids, 31 %
energy; saturated fats,  105%; polyunsaturated/saturated
ratio, 078). Eight weeks later, the experimental group had
decreased  their  intake of saturated fat,  cholesterol,  and
linoleic  acid  while  increasing  that  of oleic  and alpha-
linolenic acid.

Differences in dietary habits between groups after 1 to 4
years (table 3) were similar to those between week 0 and
weeks to 104 in the experimental group, confirmed by
the  fatty-acid  analysis  of plasma lipids  (table  4).  After
52  weeks,  there  were  higher  concentrations  of  oleic,
alpha-linolenic,  and eicosapentaenoic acids  and reduced
concentrations of stearic, linoleic, and arachidonic acids in
the  experimental  group  (table  4).  The  increase  in
eicosapentaenoic  acid  was  probably  related  to  alpha
linolenic  acid  since  intake  of fish  was not significantly
increased (table 5).  In terms of foodstuffs (table 5),  the
experimental  group had a significantly higher intake of
bread, fruit, and margarine; and a lower intake of butter,
cream, meat, and delicatessen such as ham, sausage, and
offal.

Cardiovascular disease risk factors
At  8,  52,  and  104  weeks  cholesterol,  triglycerides,
lipoproteins, apoproteins and lipoprotein a,  weight, and
blood  pressure  were  similar  in  both  groups  (table  6).
Nevertheless, the trend with time was a decrease in total and
low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and an increase
of  high  density  lipoprotein  (HDL)  cholesterol  and
apoprotein Al. The number of smokers was slightly higher
in the experimental group ( 19 vs 15 % ).

Antioxidant vitamins, determined only in the last  120
patients  in  each  group  at  52  weeks  (table  6)  were

had a markedly reduced rate of recurrence, other cardiac
events and overall mortality.

Except for the DART trial6, with an increased intake of
fish,  previous  dietary  secondary prevention  trials  were
unsuccessful. 2-4 Even in primary prevention, the only trial
successful in preventing coronary death was the Hjermann
trial .20 Owing to a small polyunsaturated to saturated fat
ratio of 0-7:1-0,1  serum cholesterol was reduced only by
13% compared to 3% in the control group, a mean net
difference  of 10% in  that  trial.  The recommendations
were  to  decrease  saturated  fat  without  increasing
polyunsaturated fat and to eat more vegetables, fish, and
fruit in addition to smoking reduction. In the present trial, a
reduction in coronary events and cardiac deaths of close to
70 % was achieved without a reduction of serum cholesterol,
triglycerides, or an increase in HDL compared to controls.
Compared with the DART trial6 the protective effect we
observed was associated with dietary supply of the n-3
long-chain  fatty  acids  precursor  (alpha-linolenic  acid)
instead of eicosapentaenoic acid and extended to non-fatal
myocardial infarction.

The margarine used contained approximately 5% alpha-
linolenic acid. Recent studies indicate that the subjects of
the Crete cohort from the Seven Country Study had 3-fold
higher concentrations of alpha-linolenic acid compared to
the Zutphen (Netherlands) cohort and 21 % lower linoleic
acid,14 In the present study, the concentration of alpha-
linolenic acid was increased by 68% in the experimental
group, and that of linoleic acid reduced by 7%. Another
interesting comparison is with the Japanese population of
Kohama  Island 26  who  have  the  lowest  incidence  of
cardiovascular diseases in Japan, probably in the World.
In Kohama, the concentration of oleic acid  was 21 5%
vs  21-8%  in  the  experimental  group in  Lyon, linoleic
acid,  26-9%  vs  273%;  alpha-linolenic  1-1  vs  10%;
eicasapentaenoic acid 1.4 vs 1.1 %; arachidonic acid, 6,5 vs
6-4%-a very similar profile.

The two populations  with the lowest coronary heart
disease  mortality  in  the  world  have  a  high  intake  of
alpha-linolenic acid; the Japanese in the form of canola and
soybean  oils,  the  Cretans,  possibly  through  the
consumption of purslanezz  and walnuts.  Whether it  is
alpha-linolenic acid that plays a protective part cannot be
determined by this study; it  is  one of the most striking
differences between the experimental and control groups
and already  present  at  8  weeks.  Also,  whether alpha-
linolenic acid acts by competing with arachidonic acid for
prostaglandin  E2  synthesis23  or  as  the  precursor  of
eicosapentaenoic acid is  not known; this last hypothesis,
however, concurrs with the results of Burr showing that a
small increase in intake of fish decreased mortality within a
few months, possibly through the prevention of ventricular
fibrillation during acute myocardial ischaemia.29

The increase in intake of oleic acid, less susceptible to
peroxidation, and in natural antioxidants, probably also
play a protective part. At one year, plasma vitamins E and C
were higher in the experimental groups, although only the
intake of vitamin C was increased. This could be due to the
known protective effect of vitamin C on vitamin E, or to
reduced peroxidation due to additional natural antioxidants
from fruits, vegetables, legumes, wine, and to a lower intake
of linoleic acid, easily oxidized in low density lipoproteins. to
The results of the present study seem consistent with recent
observations of a lower risk of coronary heart disease with a
high intake of vitamin E25 and higher concentrations of
0-carotene in adipose tissue.26 Whether or not red wine was

significantly higher in the experimental group. At 8 weeks,
the concentration of albumin in plasma was higher (47-5
[0’3] g/L vs 46.7 [0’3], p <  0’05) and the granulocyte count
lower (3-58 [0’09] x 109/L vs 3,80 [0’10], p<0’05) 
in the
experimental group. Probably due to aspirin being given to
the majority of patients, no difference between the groups
in platelet aggregation was observed.

Mortality
There were 20 deaths (8 sudden deaths) in the control and 8
(0 sudden death) in the experimental group (table 7),  1
cardiac transplant and 1 cardiomyoplasty in controls being
classified as cardiac deaths. The probability of survival by
the product-limit method (Kaplan Meier) was 0-82 in the
control and 0955 in  the experimental group (p=0’02),
confirmed by Cox model after adjustment for prognostic
variables (age, sex, smoking, cholesterol, blood pressure,
and infarct location)  the risk ratio  being 030 (p=0’02)
(table 7).

16 deaths in the control and 3 in the experimental group
were due to cardiac causes. The probability of absence of
cardiac death was 0-865 in  the control  and 0 98 in the
experimental group.

The risk  ratio  of cardiac  death  was  0-19  (95%  CI
006-065, p <  0-002), a reduction of 81 %. After adjustment
for prognostic variables, the risk ratio was 0-24 (0-07-0-85,
p=0-02),  a  reduction  of 76% (table  7)  and (97%  CI
015-091) when taking into account the early stopping rule.
Survival  curves  are  shown in  figure  1  (log  rank  test,
p <  0.003).

Primary endpoints
There  were  33  events  in  the  control  and  8  in  the
experimental group (table 7). The probability of absence of
these events was 0-787 and 0-947 respectively (log rank test,
p <  0001, figure 2). With the proportional-hazards model,
the risk ratio was 0 24 (0’ll-o’55, p<0001), 
0.27 (0-12-
0-59, p=0001), after adjustment (table 7) (97% CI 0-11-
065).

Discussion
In this study, the survivors of a first myocardial infarction,
assigned to a Mediterranean alpha-linolenic acid-rich diet,

1458

protective as has been suggested27, could not be evaluated
here since there were very few events in the experimental
group, and the controls consumed approximately the same
amount of wine.

That protection started quickly is shown by the survival
curves (figure 1 and 2). In contrast to cholesterol-lowering
drugs such as cholestyramine 211 requiring 3 to 4 years to
show a protective effect, the rapid protection induced by
diet agrees with the DART, and Hjermann 20 trials (a similar
50% reduction after  1  or 7 years),  and a recent study29
showing that  a  low-fat  vegetarian  diet  containing  nuts
(some rich  in  alpha-linolenic acid)  reduced the  rate  of
coronary events within six weeks.

The rapid protective effect and similarity of serum lipids
in our 2 groups suggest that the protective effect of the
experimental diet could be through thrombogenesis since
the  incidence  of  myocardial  infarction  was  markedly
reduced. The fact that no sudden death occurred in the
experimental group against 8 in the control group, suggests
a possible additional antiarrhthmic effect, consistent with
observations in man,6,24 and animals30 indicating that n-3
fatty  acids,  especially  alpha-linolenic  acid,  markedly
reduced the incidence of lethal arrythmias.

Background
Observational cohort studies and a secondary prevention trial have shown an in-
verse association between adherence to the Mediterranean diet and cardiovascular 
risk. We conducted a randomized trial of this diet pattern for the primary preven-
tion of cardiovascular events.

Methods
In a multicenter trial in Spain, we randomly assigned participants who were at high 
cardiovascular risk, but with no cardiovascular disease at enrollment, to one of 
three diets: a Mediterranean diet supplemented with extra-virgin olive oil, a Medi-
terranean diet supplemented with mixed nuts, or a control diet (advice to reduce 
dietary fat). Participants received quarterly individual and group educational ses-
sions and, depending on group assignment, free provision of extra-virgin olive oil, 
mixed nuts, or small nonfood gifts. The primary end point was the rate of major 
cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction, stroke, or death from cardiovascular 
causes). On the basis of the results of an interim analysis, the trial was stopped 
after a median follow-up of 4.8 years.

Results
A total of 7447 persons were enrolled (age range, 55 to 80 years); 57% were women. 
The two Mediterranean-diet groups had good adherence to the intervention, ac-
cording to self-reported intake and biomarker analyses. A primary end-point event 
occurred in 288 participants. The multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios were 0.70 
(95% confidence interval [CI], 0.54 to 0.92) and 0.72 (95% CI, 0.54 to 0.96) for the 
group assigned to a Mediterranean diet with extra-virgin olive oil (96 events) and 
the group assigned to a Mediterranean diet with nuts (83 events), respectively, ver-
sus the control group (109 events). No diet-related adverse effects were reported.

Conclusions
Among persons at high cardiovascular risk, a Mediterranean diet supplemented 
with extra-virgin olive oil or nuts reduced the incidence of major cardiovascular 
events. (Funded by the Spanish government’s Instituto de Salud Carlos III and oth-

The traditional Mediterranean diet 

is characterized by a high intake of olive 
oil, fruit, nuts, vegetables, and cereals; a 
moderate intake of fish and poultry; a low intake 
of  dairy  products,  red  meat,  processed  meats, 
and sweets; and wine in moderation, consumed 
with  meals.1  In  observational  cohort  studies2,3 
and a secondary prevention trial (the Lyon Diet 
Heart Study),4 increasing adherence to the Medi-
terranean  diet  has  been  consistently  beneficial 
with respect to cardiovascular risk.2-4 A system-
atic review ranked the Mediterranean diet as the 
most likely dietary model to provide protection 
against  coronary  heart  disease.5  Small  clinical 
trials have uncovered plausible biologic mecha-
nisms to explain the salutary effects of this food 
pattern.6-9  We  designed  a  randomized  trial  to 
test the efficacy of two Mediterranean diets (one 
supplemented with extra-virgin olive oil and an-
other with nuts), as compared with a control diet 
(advice on a low-fat diet), on primary cardiovas-
cular prevention.

Methods

Study design
The PREDIMED trial (Prevención con Dieta Med-
iterránea) was a parallel-group, multicenter, ran-
domized trial. Details of the trial design are pro-
vided elsewhere.10-12 The trial was designed and 
conducted by the authors, and the protocol was 
approved by the institutional review boards at all 
study locations. The authors vouch for the accu-
racy and completeness of the data and all analy-
ses and for the fidelity of this report to the pro-
tocol, which is available with the full text of this 
article at NEJM.org.

Supplemental foods were donated, including 
extra-virgin olive oil (by Hojiblanca and Patrimo-
nio Comunal Olivarero, both in Spain), walnuts 
(by  the  California  Walnut  Commission),  al-
monds (by Borges, in Spain), and hazelnuts (by 
La Morella Nuts, in Spain). None of the sponsors 
had any role in the trial design, data analysis, or 
reporting of the results.

Participant Selection and Randomization
Eligible participants were men (55 to 80 years of 
age) and women (60 to 80 years of age) with no 
cardiovascular disease at enrollment, who had 
either type 2 diabetes mellitus or at least three 
of  the  following  major  risk  factors:  smoking, 
hypertension,  elevated  low-density  lipoprotein 

cholesterol  levels,  low  high-density  lipoprotein 
cholesterol  levels,  overweight  or  obesity,  or  a

ease. Detailed enrollment criteria are provided 
in the Supplementary Appendix, available at NEJM 
.org. All participants provided written informed 
 consent.

Beginning  on  October  1,  2003,  participants 
were randomly assigned, in a 1:1:1 ratio, to one 
of three dietary intervention groups: a Mediter-
ranean diet supplemented with extra-virgin olive 
oil,  a  Mediterranean  diet  supplemented  with 
nuts, or a control diet. Randomization was per-
formed centrally by means of a computer-gener-
ated random-number sequence.

Interventions and Measurements
The dietary intervention8,10-13 is detailed in the 
Supplementary  Appendix.  The  specific  recom-
mended diets are summarized in Table 1. Par-
ticipants in the two Mediterranean-diet groups 
received  either  extra-virgin  olive  oil  (approxi-
mately 1 liter per week) or 30 g of mixed nuts per 
day  (15  g  of  walnuts,  7.5  g  of  hazelnuts,  and 
7.5 g of almonds) at no cost, and those in the 
control group received small nonfood gifts. No 
total  calorie  restriction  was  advised,  nor  was 
physical activity promoted.

For  participants  in  the  two  Mediterranean-
diet groups, dietitians ran individual and group 
dietary-training sessions at the baseline visit and 
quarterly thereafter. In each session, a 14-item 
dietary screener was used to assess adherence to 
the Mediterranean diet8,14 (Table S1 in the Sup-
plementary Appendix) so that personalized ad-
vice could be provided to the study participants 
in these groups.

Participants  in  the  control  group  also  re-
ceived dietary training at the baseline visit and 
completed the 14-item dietary screener used to 
assess baseline adherence to the Mediterranean 
diet. Thereafter, during the first 3 years of the 
trial, they received a leaflet explaining the low-
fat diet (Table S2 in the Supplementary Appen-
dix) on a yearly basis. However, the realization 
that the more infrequent visit schedule and less 
intense support for the control group might be 
limitations  of  the  trial  prompted  us  to  amend 
the  protocol  in  October  2006.  Thereafter,  par-
ticipants  assigned  to  the  control  diet  received 
personalized  advice  and  were  invited  to  group 
sessions with the same frequency and intensity 
as those in the Mediterranean-diet groups, with

the  use  of  a  separate  9-item  dietary  screener 
(Table S3 in the Supplementary Appendix).

A general medical questionnaire, a 137-item 
validated  food-frequency  questionnaire,15  and 
the  Minnesota  Leisure-Time  Physical  Activity 
Questionnaire  were  administered  on  a  yearly 
basis.10  Information  from  the  food-frequency 
questionnaire  was  used  to  calculate  intake  of 
energy and nutrients. Weight, height, and waist 
circumference  were  directly  measured.16  Bio-
markers  of  compliance,  including  urinary  hy-
droxytyrosol  levels  (to  confirm  compliance  in 
the  group  receiving  extra-virgin  olive  oil)  and 
plasma  alpha-linolenic  acid  levels  (to  confirm 
compliance in the group receiving mixed nuts), 
were  measured  in  random  subsamples  of  par-
ticipants at 1, 3, and 5 years (see the Supplemen-
tary Appendix).

End Points
The primary end point was a composite of myo-
cardial infarction, stroke, and death from cardio-
vascular  causes.  Secondary  end  points  were 
stroke, myocardial infarction, death from cardio-
vascular causes, and death from any cause. We 
used four sources of information to identify end 
points: repeated contacts with participants, con-
tacts with family physicians, a yearly review of 
medical records, and consultation of the Nation-
al  Death  Index.  All  medical  records  related  to 
end points were examined by the end-point adju-
dication  committee,  whose  members  were  un-
aware of the study-group assignments. Only end 
points that were confirmed by the adjudication 
committee and that occurred between October 1, 
2003, and December 1, 2010, were included in 
the  analyses.  The  criteria  for  adjudicating  pri-
mary and secondary end points are detailed in 
the Supplementary Appendix.

Statistical Analysis
We initially estimated that a sample of 9000 par-
ticipants would be required to provide statistical 
power of 80% to detect a relative risk reduction 
of 20% in each Mediterranean-diet group versus 
the control-diet group during a 4-year follow-up 
period,  assuming  an  event  rate  of  12%  in  the 
control group.10,17 In April 2008, on the advice of 
the data and safety monitoring board and on the 
basis of lower-than-expected rates of end-point 
events, the sample size was recalculated as 7400 
participants,  with  the  assumption  of  a  6-year 
follow-up  period  and  underlying  event  rates  of

* The amount of olive oil includes oil used for cooking and salads and oil con-

sumed in meals eaten outside the home. In the group assigned to the Medi-
terranean diet with extra-virgin olive oil, the goal was to consume 50 g (ap-
proximately 4 tbsp) or more per day of the polyphenol-rich olive oil supplied, 
instead of the ordinary refined variety, which is low in polyphenols.

† For participants assigned to the Mediterranean diet with nuts, the recommend-

ed consumption was one daily serving (30 g, composed of 15 g of walnuts, 
7.5 g of almonds, and 7.5 g of hazelnuts).

8.8% and 6.6% in the control and intervention 
groups, respectively. Power curves under several 
assumptions  can  be  found  in  Figure  S1  in  the 
Supplementary Appendix.

Yearly interim analyses began after a median 
of 2 years of follow-up. With the use of O’Brien–
Fleming  stopping  boundaries,  the  P  values  for 
stopping the trial at each yearly interim analysis 
were 5×10−6, 0.001, 0.009, and 0.02 for benefit 
and 9×10−5, 0.005, 0.02, and 0.05 for adverse ef-
fects.18 The stopping boundary for the benefit of 
the Mediterranean diets with respect to the pri-
mary end point was crossed at the fourth inter-
im  evaluation;  on  July  22,  2011,  the  data  and 
safety monitoring board recommended stopping 
the trial on the basis of end points documented 
through December 1, 2010.

All  primary  analyses  were  performed  on  an 
intention-to-treat basis by two independent ana-
lysts. Time-to-event data were analyzed with the 
use  of  Cox  models  with  two  dummy  variables 
(one for the Mediterranean diet with extra-virgin 
olive oil and another for the Mediterranean diet 

with  nuts)  to  obtain  two  hazard  ratios  for  the 
comparison with the control group. To account 
for small imbalances in risk factors at baseline 
among the groups, Cox regression models were 
used to adjust for sex, age, and baseline risk fac-
tors.  We  tested  the  proportionality  of  hazards 
with  the  use  of  time-varying  covariates.  All 
analyses were stratified according to center. Pre-
specified subgroup analyses were conducted ac-
cording  to  sex,  age,  body-mass  index  (BMI), 
cardiovascular-risk-factor  status,  and  baseline 
adherence to the Mediterranean diet. Sensitivity 
analyses were conducted under several assump-
tions, including imputation of data for missing 
values and participants who dropped out (see the 
Supplementary Appendix).

‡  The body-mass index is the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters.
§  The waist-to-height ratio (an index of central obesity) is the waist circumference divided by height.
¶  Hypertension was defined as a systolic blood pressure of 140 mm Hg or higher, a diastolic blood pressure of  

90 mm Hg or higher, or the use of antihypertensive therapy.

‖  Diabetes was defined as a fasting blood glucose level of 126 mg per deciliter (7.0 mmol per liter) or higher on two 

 occasions, a 2-hour plasma glucose level of 200 mg per deciliter (11 mmol per liter) or higher during a 75-g oral glu-
cose-tolerance test, or the use of antidiabetic medication.

**  Dyslipidemia was defined as a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level higher than 160 mg per deciliter (4.1 mmol 

per liter), a high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level of 40 mg per deciliter (1.0 mmol per liter) or lower in men or 50 mg 
per deciliter (1.3 mmol per liter) or lower in women, or the use of lipid-lowering therapy.

†† A family history of premature coronary heart disease (CHD) was defined as a diagnosis of the disease in a male first-

degree relative younger than 55 years of age or in a female first-degree relative younger than 65 years of age.

‡‡ The values for hormone-replacement therapy are for women only.
§§  The score for adherence to the Mediterranean diet is based on the 14-item dietary screener shown in Table S1 in the 
Supplementary Appendix (a score of 0 indicates minimum adherence, and a score of 14 indicates maximum adherence).

7447 were randomly assigned to one of the three 
study groups (Fig. S2 in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix). Their baseline characteristics according 
to study group are shown in Table 2. Drug-treat-
ment regimens were similar for participants in 
the three groups, and they continued to be bal-
anced during the follow-up period (Table S4 in 
the Supplementary Appendix).

Participants  were  followed  for  a  median  of 
4.8 years (interquartile range, 2.8 to 5.8). After 
the  initial  assessment,  209  participants  (2.8%) 
chose not to attend subsequent visits, and their 
follow-up was based on reviews of medical re-
cords. By December 2010, a total of 523 partici-
pants (7.0%) had been lost to follow-up for 2 or 
more years. Dropout rates were higher in the con-
trol  group  (11.3%)  than  in  the  Mediterranean-
diet groups (4.9%) (Fig. S2 in the Supplementary 
Appendix). As compared with participants who 
remained  in  the  trial,  those  who  dropped  out 

were  younger  (by  1.4  years),  had  a  higher  BMI 
(the weight in kilograms divided by the square of 
the height in meters; by 0.4), a higher waist-to-
height ratio (by 0.01), and a lower score for ad-
herence to the Mediterranean diet (by 1.0 points 
on the 14-item dietary screener) (P<0.05 for all 
comparisons).

Compliance with the Dietary Intervention
Participants in the three groups reported similar 
adherence to the Mediterranean diet at baseline 
(Table 2, and Fig. S3 in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix) and similar food and nutrient intakes. 
During follow-up, scores on the 14-item Medi-
terranean-diet  screener  increased  for  the  par-
ticipants in the two Mediterranean-diet groups 
(Fig. S3 in the Supplementary Appendix). There 
were significant differences between these groups 
and the control group in 12 of the 14 items at 
3 years (Table S5 in the Supplementary Appen-

dix). Changes in objective biomarkers also indi-
cated good compliance with the dietary assign-
ments  (Fig.  S4  and  S5  in  the  Supplementary 
Appendix).

Participants  in  the  two  Mediterranean-diet 
groups significantly increased weekly servings of 
fish (by 0.3 servings) and legumes (by 0.4 serv-
ings)  in  comparison  with  those  in  the  control 
group (Table S6 in the Supplementary Appendix). 
In addition, participants assigned to a Mediter-
ranean diet with extra-virgin olive oil and those 
assigned to a Mediterranean diet with nuts sig-

nificantly increased their consumption of extra-
virgin olive oil (to 50 and 32 g per day, respec-
tively) and nuts (to 0.9 and 6 servings per week, 
respectively). The main nutrient changes in the 
Mediterranean-diet groups reflected the fat con-
tent and composition of the supplemental foods 
(Tables S7 and S8 in the Supplementary Appen-
dix).  No  relevant  diet-related  adverse  effects 
were  reported  (see  the  Supplementary  Appen-
dix). We did not find any significant difference 
in changes in physical activity among the three 
groups.

End Points
The median follow-up period was 4.8 years. A 
total  of  288  primary-outcome  events  occurred: 
96 in the group assigned to a Mediterranean diet 
with extra-virgin olive oil (3.8%), 83 in the group 
assigned  to  a  Mediterranean  diet  with  nuts 
(3.4%), and 109 in the control group (4.4%). Tak-
ing into account the small differences in the ac-
crual  of  person-years  among  the  three  groups, 
the  respective  rates  of  the  primary  end  point 
were  8.1,  8.0,  and  11.2  per  1000  person-years 
(Table 3). The unadjusted hazard ratios were 0.70 
(95% confidence interval [CI], 0.53 to 0.91) for a 
Mediterranean diet with extra-virgin olive oil and 
0.70 (95% CI, 0.53 to 0.94) for a Mediterranean 
diet with nuts (Fig. 1) as compared with the con-
trol diet (P = 0.015, by the likelihood ratio test, 
for the overall effect of the intervention).

The results of multivariate analyses showed a 
similar  protective  effect  of  the  two  Mediterra-
nean diets versus the control diet with respect to 

the primary end point (Table 3). Regarding com-
ponents of the primary end point, only the com-
parisons of stroke risk reached statistical signifi-
cance (Table 3, and Fig. S6 in the Supplementary 
Appendix).  The  Kaplan–Meier  curves  for  the 
primary end point diverged soon after the trial 
started, but no effect on all-cause mortality was 
apparent (Fig. 1). The results of several sensitiv-
ity analyses were also consistent with the find-
ings  of  the  primary  analysis  (Table  S9  in  the 
Supplementary Appendix).

Subgroup Analyses
Reductions in disease risk in the two Mediterra-
nean-diet groups as compared with the control 
group were similar across the prespecified sub-
groups (Fig. 2, and Table S10 in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix). In addition, to account for the 
protocol change in October 2006 whereby the 
intensity  of  dietary  intervention  in  the  control 
group was increased, we compared hazard ratios

Figure 2. Results of Subgroup Analyses.
Shown are adjusted hazard ratios for the primary end point within specific subgroups. Squares denote hazard ratios; horizontal lines 
represent 95% confidence intervals. Hazard ratios indicate the relative risk in both intervention groups merged together (vs. the control 
group) within each stratum. Hazard ratios were stratified according to recruiting center and were adjusted for sex, age (continuous vari-
able), family history of premature coronary heart disease (CHD) (yes or no), smoking (never smoked, former smoker, or current smok-
er), body-mass index (BMI) (continuous variable), waist-to-height ratio (continuous variable), hypertension at baseline (yes or no), dys-
lipidemia at baseline (yes or no), and diabetes at baseline (yes or no). Scores for adherence to the Mediterranean diet range from 0 to 
14, with higher scores indicating greater adherence.

events per 1000 person-years, for a relative risk 
reduction  of  approximately  30%,  among  high-
risk persons who were initially free of cardiovas-
cular disease. These results support the benefits 
of the Mediterranean diet for cardiovascular risk 

reduction. They are particularly relevant given the 
challenges of achieving and maintaining weight 
loss. The secondary prevention Lyon Diet Heart 
Study also showed a large reduction in rates of 
coronary  heart  disease  events  with  a  modified

Mediterranean diet enriched with alpha-linolenic 
acid (a key constituent of walnuts). That result, 
however, was based on only a few major events.4,19,20
There were small between-group differences 
in some baseline characteristics in our trial, which 
were not clinically meaningful but were statisti-
cally significant, and we therefore adjusted for 
these variables. In fully adjusted analyses, we found 
significant  results  for  the  combined  cardiovas-
cular end point and for stroke, but not for myo-
cardial  infarction  alone.  This  could  be  due  to 
stronger effects on specific risk factors for stroke 
but also to a lower statistical power to identify 
effects  on  myocardial  infarction.  Our  findings 
are consistent with those of prior observational 
studies of the cardiovascular protective effects 
of  the  Mediterranean  diet,2,5  olive  oil,21-23  and 
nuts24,25; smaller trials assessing effects on tra-
ditional cardiovascular risk factors6-9 and novel 
risk factors, such as markers of oxidation, in-
flammation, and endothelial dysfunction6,8,26-28; 
and studies of conditions associated with high 
cardiovascular  risk  —  namely,  the  metabolic 
syndrome6,16,29 and diabetes.30-32 Thus, a causal 
role of the Mediterranean diet in cardiovascular 
prevention  has  high  biologic  plausibility.  The 
results  of  our  trial  might  explain,  in  part,  the 
lower cardiovascular mortality in Mediterranean 
countries than in northern European countries 
or the United States.33

The risk of stroke was reduced significantly 
in  the  two  Mediterranean-diet  groups.  This  is 
consistent with epidemiologic studies that showed 
an  inverse  association  between  the  Mediterra-
nean diet2,34 or olive-oil consumption22 and in-
cident stroke.

Our results compare favorably with those of 
the Women’s Health Initiative Dietary Modifica-
tion  Trial,  wherein  a  low-fat  dietary  approach 
resulted  in  no  cardiovascular  benefit.35  Salient 
components  of  the  Mediterranean  diet  report-
edly associated with better survival include mod-
erate consumption of ethanol (mostly from wine), 
low  consumption  of  meat  and  meat  products, 
and high consumption of vegetables, fruits, nuts, 
legumes, fish, and olive oil.36,37 Perhaps there is 
a synergy among the nutrient-rich foods includ-
ed in the Mediterranean diet that fosters favor-
able  changes  in  intermediate  pathways  of  car-
diometabolic risk, such as blood lipids, insulin 
sensitivity, resistance to oxidation, inflammation, 
and vasoreactivity.38

Our  study  has  several  limitations.  First,  the 
protocol for the control group was changed half-
way  through  the  trial.  The  lower  intensity  of 
dietary intervention for the control group during 
the first few years might have caused a bias to-
ward  a  benefit  in  the  two  Mediterranean-diet 
groups, since the participants in these two groups 
received  a  more  intensive  intervention  during 
that time. However, we found no significant in-
teraction between the period of trial enrollment 
(before  vs.  after  the  protocol  change)  and  the 
benefit  in  the  Mediterranean-diet  groups.  Sec-
ond, we had losses to follow-up, predominantly 
in  the  control  group,  but  the  participants  who 
dropped out had a worse cardiovascular risk pro-
file at baseline than those who remained in the 
study, suggesting a bias toward a benefit in the 
control group. Third, the generalizability of our 
findings is limited because all the study partici-
pants lived in a Mediterranean country and were 
at high cardiovascular risk; whether the results 
can be generalized to persons at lower risk or to 
other settings requires further research.

As with many clinical trials, the observed rates 
of cardiovascular events were lower than antici-
pated,  with  reduced  statistical  power  to  sepa-
rately  assess  components  of  the  primary  end 
point.  However,  favorable  trends  were  seen  for 
both  stroke  and  myocardial  infarction.  We  ac-
knowledge that, even though participants in the 
control  group  received  advice  to  reduce  fat  in-
take,  changes  in  total  fat  were  small  and  the 
largest differences at the end of the trial were in 
the distribution of fat subtypes. The interventions 
were intended to improve the overall dietary pat-
tern,  but  the  major  between-group  differences 
involved  the  supplemental  items.  Thus,  extra-
virgin olive oil and nuts were probably respon-
sible  for  most  of  the  observed  benefits  of  the 
Mediterranean  diets.  Differences  were  also  ob-
served  for  fish  and  legumes  but  not  for  other 
food  groups.  The  small  between-group  differ-
ences in the diets during the trial are probably 
due to the facts that for most trial participants 
the baseline diet was similar to the trial Mediter-
ranean diet and that the control group was given 
recommendations for a healthy diet, suggesting 
a  potentially  greater  benefit  of  the  Mediterra-
nean diet as compared with Western diets.

In conclusion, in this primary prevention trial, 
we  observed  that  an  energy-unrestricted  Medi-
terranean  diet,  supplemented  with  extra-virgin

olive oil or nuts, resulted in a substantial reduc-
tion  in  the  risk  of  major  cardiovascular  events 
among  high-risk  persons.  The  results  support 
the  benefits  of  the  Mediterranean  diet  for  the

Meta-analysis

Background: Observational studies suggest that an association between fruit and vegetable consumption and
coronary heart disease (CHD). However, the results are inconsistent. We conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate
the relationship of fruit and vegetable consumption with CHD risk and quality the dose–response relationship be-
tween them.
Methods: Relevant prospective studies were identiﬁed by a search of PubMed, Embase and Web of Science
databases to July 2014. A random-effects model was used to calculate the pooled relative risk (RR) and 95%
conﬁdence intervals (CI).
Results: Twenty-three studies involving 937,665 participants and 18,047 patients with CHD were included.
Compared with the lowest consumption levels of total fruit and vegetable, fruit and vegetable, the RR of CHD
was 0.84 (95% CI, 0.79–0.90), 0.86 (95% CI, 0.82–0.91), 0.87 (95% CI, 0.81–0.93), respectively. The dose–response
analysis indicated that, the RR of CHD was 0.88 (95% CI: 0.85–0.91) per 477 g/day of total fruit and vegetable con-
sumption, 0.84 (95% CI: 0.75–0.93) per 300 g/day of fruit intake and 0.82 (95% CI: 0.73–0.92) per 400 g/day of
vegetable consumption. A nonlinear association of CHD risk with fruit or vegetable consumption separately
was found (P for nonlinearity b0.001). In the subgroup analysis of location, a signiﬁcant inverse association
was observed in Western populations, but not in Asian populations.
Conclusions: This meta-analysis indicates that total fruit and vegetable, fruit and vegetable consumption, are sig-
niﬁcantly associated with a lower risk of CHD. The signiﬁcant inverse association was found in Western popula-
tions, but not in Asian populations, which warrants further research.

1. Introduction

Coronary heart disease (CHD) is a major cause of disease burden
in both developed and developing nations. It is the leading cause of
death and permanent disability, with heavy economic and social
costs owing to functional impairments [1,2]. Therefore the primary
prevention of CHD is an important public health and clinical medicine
priority.

Foods and nutrients are important, which are one of the main de-
terminants of CHD. Of foods and nutrients, the role of fruit and veg-
etable has been of increasing interest since they are a good source
of micronutrients, macronutrients and ﬁber requirements without

adding substantially to total energy intake [3]. Fruits and vegetables are
rich in antioxidant vitamins, minerals (e.g., potassium and magnesium),
dietary ﬁber, and phytochemicals [4]. Controlled trials have shown that
fruit and vegetable consumption has beneﬁcial effects on several risk
factors of CHD, including lipid levels [5], inﬂammation [6], and blood
pressure [7].

A meta-analysis [8] in 2007 concluded that fruit and vegetable in-
take N5 servings/day was associated with lower risk of CHD. However,
there are some limitations in the review. Firstly, the meta-analysis
only included twelve studies. Since then, a number of additional studies
have been published. Secondly, it did not assess the potential dose–
response relationship. Thirdly, several issues emerging from the in-
consistent results of later studies still warranted to be demonstrated,
including whether it was total fruit and vegetable consumption that
prevent the risk of CHD, fruit or vegetable separately, and whether
the associations were consistent in both sexes and different ethnic
backgrounds, respectively [9], and what levels of consumption of fruit

and vegetable that had the greatest protection remained unclear [10].
To investigate these key issues, we conducted a meta-analysis on all
published prospective cohort studies to investigate the association be-
tween consumption of fruit and vegetable and risk of CHD and quantify
the dose–response relationship of fruit and vegetable consumption
with CHD risk.

2. Methods

We conducted this systematic review following the Meta-analysis of Observational

Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) guidelines [11].

2.1. Search strategy

We performed a comprehensive search of Pubmed, Embase and Web of Science data-
bases from their inception through July 2014 for prospective cohort studies published in
peer-reviewed journals describing an association between fruit and vegetable consump-
tion and risk of CHD. Search terms included fruits, vegetables, diet, cardiovascular dis-
ease, ischemic heart disease, myocardial infarction, coronary disease, heart disease,
sudden cardiac death, cohort studies, prospective studies and follow-up studies.
The search was restricted to human studies. No restrictions were imposed on language
of publications. We also reviewed references from retrieved articles to identify additional
studies. One investigator (YG) screened the titles and abstracts of all identiﬁed articles;
two investigators (YG and XYT) assessed the eligibility of full-texts of potentially relevant
articles.

2.2. Study selection

Studies were included in this meta-analysis if they met the following criteria: (1) the
study was a prospective cohort study; (2) the exposure of interest was fruit or vegetable
consumption; (3) the outcome of interest was risk of CHD; and (4) the study reported
risk estimates with corresponding 95% CI for the association between fruit and vegetables
and CHD or provided corresponding data to calculate the variance. If duplicate publica-
tions from the same study were identiﬁed, we included the result with the largest number
of cases from the study.

2.3. Data extraction

Two investigators (YG and XYT) independently extracted the data by using a stan-
dardized electronic format, including the name of ﬁrst author, publication year, study lo-
cation, sample size, sex, age range or mean age at entry, length of follow-up, number of
cases, method of assessment of exposure, outcome measurements, relative risks (RRs)
with corresponding 95% CIs for all categories of fruit and vegetable consumption, and co-
variates included in the adjusted models. We extracted risk estimates with the most ad-
justment (when available). For dose–response analysis, when studies reported the
consumption in servings or times per day or week or month, we standardized all data
into g per day, using standard units of 106 g for total fruit and vegetable [12,13], 80 g for
fruit and 77 g for vegetable [8]. Differences in data extraction between the two investiga-
tors were resolved by discussion with the third investigator (ZXL).

2.4. Quality assessment

We assessed the methodological quality of study by using an assessment tool with ref-
erence to MOOSE [11] and STROBE [14]. The scoring system was a maximum of 5 points (1
point for appropriate inclusion and exclusion criteria; 1 point if the fruit and vegetable
consumption assessment was validated; 1 point if the consumption of fruit and
vegetable was appropriately categorized; 1 point if the ascertainment of outcome was
conﬁrmed according to the accepted clinical criteria and not based on self-report; 1
point for the controlled of confounders). The scores from 0 to 3 were considered as
lower study quality, and scores from 4 to 5 were considered as higher study quality.
Each study was rated independently by two investigators (YG and XYT).

2.5. Statistical analysis

RRs were considered as the common measure of the association between fruit
and vegetable consumption and CHD risk. We preferentially pooled multivariable ad-
justed RRs' estimates where such estimates were available. When adjusted estimates
were unavailable (one study), we pooled the unadjusted estimates. A random effects
model was used to calculate summary RRs and 95% CIs for the highest versus the lowest
level of consumption of fruit and vegetable and for the dose–response analysis [15]. For
two studies [16,17] that included data from multiple cohorts, we considered the analysis
for each cohort as an independent report. One study [18] respectively reported the risk es-
timates of fruit and vegetable intake and CHD by smoking status (never smokers, former
smokers and current smokers), and was considered as three independent reports. Any
studies that expressed data separately for fatal CHD and nonfatal MI or for men and
women, the analysis for each sex or subtype of CHD was also treated as an independent
report.

For the dose–response analysis, we used the method described by Greenland and
Longnecker [19] to calculate the trend from the correlated estimates for log relative risk

across categories of fruit and vegetable consumption. The amount of fruit and vegetable
consumption, the distributions of cases and person years, and RRs and 95% CI were ex-
tracted according to the method. If the person years were not available for each category
of fruit and vegetable intake, but reported the total number of cases/person-years, we es-
timated the distribution. If consumption of fruit and vegetable was analyzed by quartiles
(and could be approximated), e.g., the total number of person years was divided by 4
when the data were analyzed by quartiles in order to derive the number of person-years
in each quartile [20].

The median or mean fruit and vegetable consumption in each category was assigned
to the corresponding dose of consumption. The midpoint of the upper and lower bound-
aries was considered the dose of each category if the median or the mean intake per
category was not available. When the lower boundary for the lowest category was not pro-
vided, the assigned median value was half of the upper boundary of that category. If the
highest category was open-ended, we assumed that the median value of the category
was the cut-off point plus a 25% increment.

We presented the dose–response results in the forest plots for a 477, 300 and
400 g/day increment for total fruit and vegetable, fruit and vegetable on the basis of
intakes associated with the lowest risk in observational studies [21] and the dietary
targets set by advocacy organization [22]. Additionally, we used restricted cubic
splines with 4 knots at percentiles 5%, 35%, 65%, and 95% to test for nonlinearity in
the association between fruit and vegetable consumption and CHD risk.

Statistical heterogeneity across studies was assessed by using the I2 statistic
(ranging from 0% to 100%). I2 values of 25%, 50%, and 75% represent cut-off points
for low, moderate, and high degrees of heterogeneity, respectively [23,24]. Subgroup
analyses were conducted to explore the potential sources of heterogeneity among
studies, and the differences among groups were tested by using meta-regression.
Sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate the effect of removing a single
study from the analysis on pool risk estimates. The Begg's test [25] and Egger's test
[26] were used to assess the potential publication bias. All statistical analyses were
conducted with STATA version 12.0 (StataCorp, College Station, Texas, USA). P values
were two tailed with a signiﬁcance level of 0.05.

3. Results

3.1. Literature search

The results of literature research and selection were shown in Fig. 1.
We identiﬁed 408 articles from the PubMed, 564 articles from the
Embase and 332 articles from the Web of Science. After the initial
screening, based on titles and abstracts, 452 articles remained for
further full-text assessment. After retrieving the full-text review of the
remaining 26 articles for detailed evaluation, three articles were exclud-
ed because they were duplicate publications. Finally, 23 prospective co-
hort studies [16–18,27–46] comprising 25 independent cohorts were
included in this meta-analysis.

3.2. Study characteristics

Characteristics of the included studies are presented in Supplemen-
tal Table 1. These studies involving 937,665 participants and 18,047 pa-
tients with CHD were published between 1992 and 2014 during follow-
up periods ranging from 5 to 37 years. Nine studies [16,33,34,36,37,39,
40,44,46] were from the United States, 9 studies [18,27,29–31,35,38,
41,42] were from Europe, and 5 studies [17,28,32,43,45] were from
Asia (China and Japan). 14 studies [16,17,27–29,32,35–37,41–44,46] in-
cluded both men and women, 5 studies [18,30,34,38,40] men only and 4
studies [31,33,39,45] women only. The dietary intake was assessed by
food frequency questionnaires (FFQ) in all studies, except for 5 studies
(3-day food record [46], dietary history interview [42], 7-day diet record
[34], 7-day household inventory [35], 24-hour recall [29]). The scores
from our assessment of study quality ranged from 3 to 5 scores. The
average score was 4.6.

3.3. Association between total fruit and vegetable consumption and risk of
CHD

Twelve studies [16–18,27–31,34,36,37,39] with 16 reports investi-
gated the relationship between the highest versus the lowest categories
of total fruit and vegetable consumption levels and CHD risk. The RRs of
CHD for the highest versus the lowest total fruit and vegetable con-
sumption categories were shown in Fig. 2. Of the 16 reports, 5 showed

a signiﬁcantly inverse relationship between total fruit and vegetable in-
take and risk of CHD, while the other reports did not. The pooled RR was
0.84 (95% CI, 0.79–0.90), and there was a low heterogeneity (I2 = 9.0%;
P = 0.350).

Ten studies [16–18,27–29,31,36,37,39] with 14 reports were includ-
ed in the dose–response analysis of total fruit and vegetable consump-
tion and CHD risk. Pooling these studies, an increment of 477 g/day of
total fruit and vegetable consumption was associated with 12% lower
risk of CHD (RR: 0.88; 95% CI: 0.85, 0.91), and there was no heterogene-
ity (I2 = 0%, P = 0.643) (Fig. 3). In the cubic spline model that included
all studies, we did not ﬁnd evidence suggesting any nonlinear associa-
tion between total fruit and vegetable consumption and risk of CHD
(Fig. 4; P for nonlinearity = 0.205).

3.4. Association between fruit consumption and risk of CHD

Eighteen studies [16–18,27,29,31–35,38,39,41–46] with 26 reports
investigated the relationship between comparing high with low fruit
consumption levels and CHD risk. The RRs of CHD for the highest versus
the lowest fruit consumption categories were shown in Fig. 5. Of the 26
reports, 6 showed a signiﬁcantly inverse relationship between fruit
intake and risk of CHD, while the other reports did not. The pooled
RR was 0.86 (95% CI, 0.82–0.91), and there was no heterogeneity
(I2 = 0%; P = 0.762).

Fifteen studies [16–18,27,29,31–33,35,38,39,41,43,44,46] with 22
reports were included in the dose–response analysis of total fruit
and vegetable consumption and CHD risk. Pooling these studies, an

3.5. Association between vegetable consumption and risk of CHD

Sixteen studies [16–18,27,29,31,32,34,35,38–42,45,46] with 22 re-
ports investigated the relationship between comparing high with low
vegetable consumption levels and CHD risk. The RRs of CHD for the
highest versus the lowest vegetable consumption categories were
shown in Supplemental Fig. 1. Of the 22 reports, 6 showed a signiﬁcant-
ly inverse relationship between vegetable intake and risk of CHD, while
the other reports did not. The pooled RR was 0.87 (95% CI, 0.81–0.93),
and there was a low heterogeneity (I2 = 13.3%; P = 0.282).

Thirteen studies [16–18,27,29,31,32,35,38–41,46] with 18 reports
were included in the dose–response analysis of vegetable consumption
and CHD risk. Pooling these studies, an increment of 400 g/day of vege-
table consumption was associated with 18% lower risk of CHD (RR: 0.82,
95% CI: 0.73, 0.92), and there was a medium heterogeneity (I2 = 35.6%,
P = 0.068) (Supplemental Fig. 2). In the cubic spline model that includ-
ed all studies, nonlinear association between vegetable consumption
and risk of CHD was found (Supplemental Fig. 3; P for nonlinearity
b0.001).

increment of 300 g/day of fruit consumption was associated with
16% lower risk of CHD (RR: 0.84, 95% CI: 0.75, 0.93), and there was
a medium heterogeneity (I2 = 31.7%, P = 0.078) (Fig. 6). In the
cubic spline model that included all studies, nonlinear association
between fruit consumption and risk of CHD was found (Fig. 7; P for
nonlinearity b0.001).

The results from subgroup analyses examining the robustness of
the primary results and exploring the resource of potential heteroge-
neity were shown in Supplemental Table 2. For the relations between
fruit and vegetable consumption and CHD risk, a low statistical hetero-
geneity was found. However, no statistically signiﬁcant source of

and vegetable consumption and risk of CHD in the meta-regression
analysis of sex, study location, follow-up duration, dietary assess-
ment, publication year, smoking status, physical activity, body mass
index, energy intake, and other diet variables (P N 0.05 for each). A
statistically signiﬁcant source of heterogeneity was identiﬁed for
the association between vegetable consumption and risk of CHD in

decreased risk of CHD was more evident in these studies published
before 2006 (RR: 0.77, 95% CI, 0.69, 0.85) than after 2006 (RR:
0.92, 95% CI, 0.85, 0.98). Notably, we found that in studies published
before 2006, total fruit and vegetable consumption was not signiﬁ-
cantly associated with risk of CHD (RR: 0.92, 95% CI, 0.81, 1.03),
but in later studies, total fruit and vegetable consumption was asso-
ciated with CHD risk (RR: 0.82, 95% CI, 0.76, 0.88). For total fruit and
vegetable, fruit or vegetable consumption, the signiﬁcant inverse as-
sociations were identiﬁed in western countries, but not in Asian
countries.

3.7. Sensitive analysis

The inverse association was not materially changed in the leave-
one-out analyses by omitting one study in turn, with a pooled RR of
CHD range from 0.85 (95% CI, 0.79–0.91; I2 = 9.3%, P = 0.350) to 0.83
(95% CI 0.77–0.88; I2 = 0%, P = 0.577), from 0.87 (95% CI, 0.83–0.92;
I2 = 0%, P = 0.786) to 0.86 (95% CI 0.81–0.91; I2 = 0%, P = 0.719),
from 0.87 (95% CI, 0.82–0.93; I2 = 6.8%, P = 0.371) to 0.85 (95% CI
0.79–0.92; I2 = 12.8%, P = 0.291) for the highest versus the lowest con-
sumption of total fruit and vegetable, fruit and vegetable, respectively.
Similarity, in dose–response analysis, the inverse association was not
still changed by removing one study at a time, with a pooled RR range
from 0.89 (95% CI, 0.85–0.93; I2 = 0%, P = 0.641) to 0.87 (95% CI
0.83–0.91; I2 = 0%, P = 0.589), from 0.84 (95% CI, 0.74–0.95; I2 =
34.8%, P = 0.059) to 0.81 (95% CI 0.75–0.88; I2 = 11.7%, P = 0.306),
from 0.84 (95% CI, 0.76–0.93; I2 = 27.5%, P = 0.141) to 0.80 (95% CI
0.70–0.91; I2 = 32.6%, P = 0.095) for the consumption of total fruit
and vegetable, fruit and vegetable, respectively.

3.8. Publication bias

In the analyses of the highest compared with the lowest category,
the Begg's and the Egger's tests did not provide any signiﬁcant evidence
of the publication bias for studies that investigate the relation of CHD
risk with total fruit and vegetable consumption (Begg's P = 0.822,
Egger's P = 0.529), fruit consumption (Begg's P = 0.597, Egger's
P = 0.947) and vegetable consumption (Begg's P = 0.910, Egger's
P = 0.889). Additionally, no signiﬁcant evidence of substantial publica-
tion bias was observed for dose–response analyses (Begg's P = 0.367,
Egger's P = 0.591 for fruit consumption, Begg's P = 0.880, Egger's
P = 0.381 for vegetable consumption and Begg's P = 0.880, Egger's
P = 0.381 for total fruit and vegetable consumption).

4. Discussion

This meta-analysis indicated that higher fruit and vegetable
consumption is inversely associated with CHD. In the dose–response
analysis, we found that the risk of CHD decreased by 12%, 16% and
18% for daily 477 g of total fruit and vegetable, daily 300 g of fruit and
daily 400 g of vegetable, respectively. There was evidence of a nonlinear
association for both fruit and vegetable consumption.

Results of this updated meta-analysis generally concur and further
complement the ﬁndings of previous review in several important as-
pects. Our meta-analysis strengthens previous results by including 11
additionally published large scale prospective cohort studies. Our anal-
yses on prospective studies investigating the association between fruit
and vegetable intake and CHD risk involved about twice as many CHD
events as the previous review. The present review also further
quantiﬁes the dose–response relationship of fruit and vegetable con-
sumption with the risk of CHD. Additionally, we performed the more
detailed subgroup analyses (such as adjustment for physical activity
and energy intake) to test the robustness of results and explore the
potential heterogeneity.

In subgroup analyses, we obtained a valuable and important ﬁnding.
We found that there was a statistically signiﬁcant inverse association
between fruit and/or vegetable consumption and CHD risk in Western
populations, but not in Asian populations, which was an interesting
phenomenon. Food preparation methods may partially explain the dif-
ferences. Cooked, boiled, and steamed vegetable are major preparation
methods in Eastern cuisine. Such methods of processing vegetables
may lead to loss of water-soluble, heat-sensitive and oxygen-labile nu-
trients. In addition, more salt was generally added during home cooking
and this may decrease the beneﬁts of vegetables, [47] which could
contribute to the lower CHD risk in Western populations than in Asian
populations. More importantly, we noted that the amounts of fruit
and vegetable consumption in studies conducted in Western countries
were much higher than the amounts of fruit and vegetable consumption
in Asian countries. In other words, the ﬁnding conﬁrmed that the fruit
and vegetable consumption was associated with CHD risk. Notably,
the null inverse association in Asian participants might also result
from the limited number of included studies (ﬁve studies including
194,207 participants and 989 patients with CHD). More studies are war-
ranted to investigate the potential difference between the different eth-
nic backgrounds.

Some potential biological mechanisms may preliminarily explain
the inverse association between fruit and vegetable consumption and
CHD. Investigating the effects of fruit and vegetable consumption on
established cardiovascular disease risk factors is proposed as an impor-
tant step in determining the biological plausibility of the causal relation-
ship between consumption of fruit and vegetable and the risk of CHD
[48]. Evidence from epidemiological studies and clinical trials has
shown that fruit and vegetable consumption is inversely associated
with blood pressure [49–52], cholesterol [53] and lipid [54], which are
main risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Additionally, the speciﬁc
constituents of fruits and vegetables have been proposed as for the

mechanisms for the inverse association between consumption of fruit
and vegetable and CHD risk. Antioxidant compounds and polyphenols
in fruit and vegetables, such as vitamin C, vitamin E, carotenoids, and
ﬂavonoids, have been shown to increase the antioxidant capacity of
serum [55], protect against the oxidation of cholesterol and other lipids
[56], decrease in cellular oxidative stress [57], inhibition of inﬂamma-
tion [58], and increase the formation of endothelial prostacyclin that
prevents platelet aggregation and reduces vascular tone [59,60].

4.1. Strengths and limitations

Although our review is an updated meta-analysis, the strengths and
importance are obvious. Firstly, we added more than twice as many
participants as the previous review, which provided stronger and
more sufﬁcient evidence. Secondly, we obtained an important ﬁnding
that a signiﬁcantly inverse association between fruit and vegetable
consumption and CHD risk was observed in Western populations, but
not in Asian populations. Thirdly, we not only analyzed the association
of higher fruit and vegetable consumption with CHD risk, but also con-
ducted the dose–response analysis to evaluate the linear and non-linear
relations by using all the categories of data, which could help to quantify
the associations and examine the shape of these possible associations. A
signiﬁcant nonlinear association of CHD risk with fruit and vegetable
consumption was found.

Several limitations should be acknowledged. Most original studies
included used FFQ to assess levels of fruit and vegetable consumption.
Although validation studies showed that FFQ was a reasonable tool to
assess the intakes of fruit and vegetable [61], measurement error was
inevitable. Secondly, although the original studies included in our
analysis adjusted for multiple major risk factors except for one study,
the possibility of residual confounding by imprecisely or unmeasured
factors should be considered, because fruit and vegetable consumers
tended to follow other healthy diet behaviors. Thus, it was difﬁcult to
identify the independent effects of fruit and vegetable consumption
from other healthy diet and lifestyle in observational analyses. Thirdly,
the differences in classiﬁcations of fruit and vegetable and in the types
consumed among original studies, which could have attenuated our
results.

For future research, based on our ﬁndings, we suggest that initially,
the investigators need to improve the standardization of different die-
tary assessment methods, which may make observed effects more accu-
rate and conceivable. Then, the use of biological and genetic markers as
surrogate end points in future research should help to clarify the cause
and effect relationship that link fruit and vegetable consumption and
CHD.

5. Conclusion

In summary, this meta-analysis indicates signiﬁcant inverse associa-
tions between higher consumption of fruit and vegetable and CHD. The
risk of CHD was reduced by 12% for per 477 g/day in total fruit and veg-
etable, by 16% for per 300 g/day in fruit, and by 18% for per 400 g/day in
vegetable. This nonlinear association of CHD risk with fruit or vegetable
consumption separately was observed. Our results support current rec-
ommendations to increase fruit and vegetable consumption to promote
health and prevent chronic disease.

Background
Low-carbohydrate diets have been advocated for weight loss and to prevent obesity, 
but the long-term safety of these diets has not been determined.

Methods
We evaluated data on 82,802 women in the Nurses’ Health Study who had com-
pleted a validated food-frequency questionnaire. Data from the questionnaire were 
used to calculate a low-carbohydrate-diet score, which was based on the percentage 
of energy as carbohydrate, fat, and protein (a higher score reflects a higher intake 
of fat and protein and a lower intake of carbohydrate). The association between the 
low-carbohydrate-diet score and the risk of coronary heart disease was examined.

Results
During 20 years of follow-up, we documented 1994 new cases of coronary heart 
disease. After multivariate adjustment, the relative risk of coronary heart disease 
comparing highest and lowest deciles of the low-carbohydrate-diet score was 0.94 
(95% confidence interval [CI], 0.76 to 1.18; P for trend = 0.19). The relative risk 
comparing highest and lowest deciles of a low-carbohydrate-diet score on the basis 
of the percentage of energy from carbohydrate, animal protein, and animal fat was 
0.94 (95% CI, 0.74 to 1.19; P for trend = 0.52), whereas the relative risk on the basis 
of the percentage of energy from intake of carbohydrates, vegetable protein, and 
vegetable fat was 0.70 (95% CI, 0.56 to 0.88; P for trend = 0.002). A higher glycemic 
load was strongly associated with an increased risk of coronary heart disease (rela-
tive risk comparing highest and lowest deciles, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.15 to 3.15; P for 
trend = 0.003).

Conclusions
Our findings suggest that diets lower in carbohydrate and higher in protein and fat 
are not associated with increased risk of coronary heart disease in women. When 
vegetable sources of fat and protein are chosen, these diets may moderately reduce 
the risk of coronary heart disease.

Obesity  in  the  united  states  has 

reached  epidemic  proportions.  Leading 
research and medical societies advocate a 
low-fat, high-carbohydrate, energy-deficient diet 
to manage weight.1-4 Despite these recommenda-
tions, diets high in fat and protein and low in car-
bohydrate remain popular, and several best-selling 
books endorse this strategy for weight loss.5-9

The long-term safety of carbohydrate-restricted 
diets remains controversial. Most such diets tend 
to encourage increased consumption of animal 
products and therefore often contain high amounts 
of saturated fat and cholesterol. This may cause 
unfavorable changes in serum lipid levels and in-
crease the risk of coronary heart disease. Several 
professional organizations have cautioned against 
the use of low-carbohydrate diets.10-13

We devised a system to classify women who 
participated in the Nurses’ Health Study according 
to their relative levels of fat, protein, and carbohy-
drate intake and created a simple summary score 
designated the “low-carbohydrate-diet score.” We 
then examined prospectively the association be-
tween the low-carbohydrate-diet score and the 
risk of coronary heart disease in this cohort.

Methods

Study population
The Nurses’ Health Study was initiated in 1976, 
when 121,700 female registered nurses 30 to 55 
years of age completed a mailed questionnaire. 
Since 1976, information on disease status and life-
style factors has been collected from this same 
cohort every 2 years. Diet was assessed by means 
of a semiquantitative food-frequency questionnaire 
in 1980, 1984, 1986, 1990, 1994, and 1998; 98,462 
women completed the 1980 questionnaire.

For this investigation we excluded all women 
at baseline who left 10 or more food items blank 
or had implausibly high (>3500 kcal) or low (<500 
kcal) daily energy intakes on the food-frequency 
questionnaire. We further excluded women with 
a history of diabetes, cancer, or cardiovascular 
disease  before  1980,  because  these  diagnoses 
may cause alterations in diet. After these exclu-
sions, 82,802 women remained in this investiga-
tion.  The  study  was  approved  by  the  Human 
Research Committee of Brigham and Women’s 
Hospital in Boston; the completion of the self-
administered  questionnaire  was  considered  to 
imply informed consent.

Assessment of Diet and Glycemic Load
The 1980 food-frequency questionnaire included 
61 food items and was revised in 1984 to include 
about twice that number.14,15 Study participants 
reported average frequency of consumption of spe-
cific foods throughout the previous year. The va-
lidity and reproducibility of the questionnaire 
have been documented elsewhere.14,15

To calculate the intake of specific foods, a com-
monly used portion size for each food was speci-
fied (e.g., one egg or one slice of bread) and par-
ticipants were asked how often, on average, during 
the previous year they had consumed that amount. 
The possible responses ranged from never or 
less than once per month to six or more times 
per day.

Nutrient values were computed by multiplying 
the  frequency  of  consumption  of  each  food  by 
the nutrient content of the portion and then add-
ing these products across all food items. All food-
composition values were obtained from the Har-
vard University food-composition database, which 
was derived from U.S. Department of Agriculture 
sources16 and supplemented with information 
from the manufacturer. The validity of estimated 
nutrient intake as assessed by the questionnaire 
has previously been evaluated with the use of mul-
tiple diet records. The correlation between the 
1986 questionnaire and the average of six 1-week 
diet records collected in 1980 and 1986 was 0.73 
for carbohydrate, 0.67 for total fat, and 0.56 for 
protein.15

The method used to assess glycemic load in 
the Nurses’ Health Study has been described else-
where.17 Briefly, we calculated the total dietary 
glycemic load by multiplying the carbohydrate con-
tent of each food by its glycemic index (the glyce-
mic index of glucose is 100) and then multiplied 
this value by the frequency of consumption and 
summed these values for all foods. Dietary gly-
cemic load, therefore, represents both the quality 
and quantity of carbohydrate consumed. Each unit 
of glycemic load represents the equivalent blood 
glucose–raising effect of 1 g of pure glucose.

Calculation of the low-carbohydrate-diet 
score
We divided the study participants into 11 strata 
each of fat, protein, and carbohydrate intake, ex-
pressed as a percentage of energy (Table 1). For 
fat and protein, women in the highest stratum re-
ceived 10 points for that macronutrient, women

in the next stratum received 9 points, and so on 
down to women in the lowest stratum, who re-
ceived 0 points. For carbohydrate, the order of 
the strata was reversed; those with the lowest car-
bohydrate intake received 10 points and those 
with the highest carbohydrate intake received 
0  points. We used the percentage of energy con-
sumed instead of absolute intake to reduce bias 
due to underreporting of food consumption and 
to represent dietary composition.

The points for each of the three macronutri-
ents were then summed to create the overall diet 
score, which ranged from 0 (the lowest fat and 
protein intake and the highest carbohydrate in-
take) to 30 (the highest protein and fat intake 
and the lowest carbohydrate intake). Therefore, 
the higher the score, the more closely the partic-
ipant’s diet followed the pattern of a low-carbo-
hydrate diet. Thus, the score was termed the “low-
carbohydrate-diet score.”

We also created two additional low-carbohy-
drate-diet scores. One was calculated according 
to the percentage of energy as carbohydrate, the 
percentage of energy as animal protein, and the 
percentage of energy as animal fat, and the other 
was calculated according to the percentage of 
energy as carbohydrate, the percentage of energy 
as vegetable protein, and the percentage of en-
ergy as vegetable fat (Table 1).

Measurement of Nondietary Factors
In 1976, women provided information regarding 
parental history of myocardial infarction. Begin-
ning in 1976, participants also provided informa-

tion every 2 years on the use of postmenopausal 
hormones, smoking status, body weight, and oth-
er covariates. They provided information on aspi-
rin use repeatedly throughout the follow-up. The 
correlation coefficient between self-reported body 
weight and measured weight was 0.96.18 Physical 
activity was assessed in 1980, 1982, 1986, 1988, 
1992, 1996, and 1998, and we calculated the cu-
mulative average number of hours per week spent 
in moderate or vigorous physical activity.19

Outcome
The outcome of this study was incident coronary 
heart disease, including nonfatal myocardial in-
farctions or fatal coronary events. Each partici-
pant contributed follow-up time from the date 
of returning the 1980 questionnaire to the date 
of the first end point (death or nonfatal myocar-
dial infarction) or until the censoring date of 
June 1, 2000.

We requested permission to examine the med-
ical records of all participants who reported a di-
agnosis of coronary heart disease on one of the 
follow-up questionnaires that were completed ev-
ery two years. A myocardial infarction was con-
sidered to be confirmed if it met the World Health 
Organization criteria of symptoms and either 
typical electrocardiographic changes or elevated 
cardiac-enzyme levels.20 Infarctions that neces-
sitated a hospital admission and for which con-
firmatory information was obtained by interview 
or letter but for which no medical records were 
available were designated as probable and were 
included in the analysis.

to 27.9, 28.0 to 29.9, 30.0 to 31.9, 32.0 to 33.9, 34.0 to 39.9, or ≥40.0), smoking status (never, past, or current [1 to 14, 15 to 24, or ≥25 ciga-
rettes a day]), postmenopausal hormone use (never, current use, or past use), hours of physical activity per week (<1, 1 to 2, 2 to 4, 4 to 7, 
or >7), alcohol intake (0, <5 g per day, 5 to 14 g per day, or ≥15 g per day), number of times aspirin was used per week (<1, 1 to 2, 3 to 6, 
7 to 14, or ≥15), use of multivitamins (yes or no), use of vitamin E supplement (yes or no), history of hypertension (yes or no), history of 
hypercholesterolemia (yes or no), and parental history of myocardial infarction (yes or no).

Deaths  were  identified  from  state  vital  rec-
ords and the National Death Index or reported by 
the participants’ next of kin or the U.S. Postal 
Service.21 Fatal coronary heart disease was con-
firmed by an examination of autopsy or hospital 
records, by a listing of coronary heart disease as 
the cause of death on the death certificate, and 
by the availability of evidence of previous coronary 
heart disease. Those deaths in which coronary 
heart disease was the underlying cause on the 

death certificate but for which no medical records 
were available were designated as deaths from 
presumed coronary disease.

Statistical analysis
We divided women into 10 categories (deciles) ac-
cording to their low-carbohydrate-diet score. To 
represent long-term intake and reduce measure-
ment error, we calculated the cumulative average 
low-carbohydrate-diet score based on the infor-

mation from the 1980, 1984, 1986, 1990, 1994, 
and 1998 questionnaires.22 For example, the low-
carbohydrate-diet score from the 1980 question-
naire  was  related  to  the  incidence  of  coronary 
heart disease between 1980 and 1984, and the low-
carbohydrate-diet score from the average of the 
1980 and 1984 questionnaires was related to the 
incidence of coronary heart disease between 1984 
and 1986. Incidence rates for coronary heart dis-
ease were calculated by dividing cases by the per-
son-years of follow-up for each decile of the low-
carbohydrate-diet score. Relative risks of coronary 
heart disease were calculated by dividing the rate 
of occurrence of coronary heart disease in each 
decile by the rate in the first (lowest) decile. We 

used Cox proportional-hazards models23 to ad-
just for potentially confounding variables. Because 
low-carbohydrate diets may decrease subsequent 
energy intake,24 we did not control for total energy 
intake in multivariate models. However, further 
adjustment for caloric intake was performed in a 
secondary analysis. We also examined the asso-
ciation between each macronutrient and the risk 
of coronary heart disease in multivariate nutrient-
density models.22 All P values are two-sided.

R esults

The  cumulative  average  low-carbohydrate-diet 
score ranged from a median of 5.0 in the 1st decile

index increased by approximately 2.5 units from 
baseline to the end of follow-up, regardless of the 
low-carbohydrate-diet score.

Because the Nurses’ Health Study did not rou-
tinely collect data on blood lipid levels, the effect 
of a low-carbohydrate diet on lipids could not be 
assessed for the entire study cohort. However, a 
subgroup of women from the study (466 women) 
had blood drawn in 1990 for determinations of 
lipid levels. In this subgroup, the low-carbohy-
drate-diet score was not associated with the total 
cholesterol level or with the levels of high-den-
sity  lipoprotein  (HDL)  cholesterol  or  low-density 
lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol after adjustment for 
age, smoking status, and other covariates. The low-
carbohydrate-diet score was inversely associated 
with the triglyceride level (126.5 mg per deciliter 
in the lowest quintile and 99.3 mg per deciliter 

in the highest quintile of the low-carbohydrate-
diet score, P for trend = 0.05).

During 20 years of follow-up (1,584,042 per-
son-years), we documented 1994 cases of coro-
nary heart disease. In age-adjusted analyses, the 
relative risk comparing women in the 10th decile 
with those in the 1st decile of the low-carbohy-
drate-diet score was 1.29 (95% confidence interval 
[CI], 1.04 to 1.60). After further adjustment for 
smoking status, the relative risk of coronary heart 
disease was 1.11 (95% CI, 0.89 to 1.38) compar-
ing women in the same deciles of the low-carbo-
hydrate-diet score (P for trend = 0.54) (Table 3). 
After controlling for potential confounders, the 
relative risk was 0.94 (95% CI, 0.76 to 1.18; P for 
trend = 0.19). Further adjustment for total calo-
ries did not appreciably alter the results (relative 
risk, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.77 to 1.20; P for trend = 0.27).

When body-mass index was removed from the 
multivariate model, the results did not change 
significantly.

In stratified analyses, there was no evidence 
that the relationship between the low-carbohy-
drate-diet score and coronary heart disease was 
modified as a result of body-mass index, level of 
physical activity, smoking status, or the presence 
or absence of diabetes, hypertension, or hypercho-
lesterolemia. Specific data on blood lipid levels 
were not available for most of the cohort. As a 
result, it was not feasible to adjust or stratify our 
analysis for this factor.

We also created a second low-carbohydrate-
diet score according to the percentages of energy 
from carbohydrate, animal protein, and animal fat 
(Table 1). The multivariate relative risk of coro-
nary heart disease was 0.94 (95% CI, 0.74 to 1.19) 
for the comparison of the 10th with the 1st dec-
ile (P for trend = 0.52) (Table 3). We also created 
a third low-carbohydrate-diet score according to 
the percentages of energy from carbohydrate, veg-
etable protein, and vegetable fat (Table 1). For the 
comparison of the 10th with the 1st decile, the 
multivariate relative risk of coronary heart disease 
was 0.70 (95% CI, 0.56 to 0.88; P for trend = 0.002) 
(Table 3).

We examined the association between coro-
nary heart disease and each macronutrient sepa-
rately  (Table  4).  Total  carbohydrate  intake  was 
associated  with  a  moderately  increased  risk  of 
coronary heart disease (P for trend for the com-
parison  of  the  10th  decile  with  the  1st  dec-
ile = 0.06). For the comparison of the 10th with 
the 1st decile, there was a significant direct as-
sociation between dietary glycemic load and coro-
nary  heart  disease  (relative  risk,  1.90;  95%  CI, 
1.15 to 3.15; P for trend = 0.003). The overall di-
etary  glycemic  index  had  a  direct  association 
with the risk of coronary heart disease (relative 
risk  comparing  extreme  deciles,  1.19;  95%  CI, 
0.91 to 1.55; P for trend = 0.04). There was a sig-
nificant  inverse  association  between  vegetable-
fat consumption and the risk of coronary heart 
disease (relative risk comparing extreme deciles, 
0.75; 95% CI, 0.57 to 0.98; P for trend = 0.006). 
Total fat, animal fat, total protein, animal protein, 
and vegetable protein were not significantly as-
sociated with the risk of coronary heart disease 
according to multivariate analyses.

Discussion

We  found  that  after  taking  into  account  con-
founding variables (especially smoking status), 
a low-carbohydrate diet was not associated with 
a risk of coronary heart disease in this large pro-
spective cohort of women. In fact, when vegeta-
ble sources of fat and protein were chosen, the 
low-carbohydrate-diet score was associated with 
a moderately lower risk of coronary heart disease 
than when animal sources were chosen.

The 20-year follow-up incorporating updated 
dietary data and the large number of women in 
the study provided adequate power for this study. 
We reduced the measurement error in assessing 
long-term diet in this analysis with the use of re-
peated measures of diet during the follow-up. Al-
though we adjusted for many known risk factors, 
we cannot completely exclude the possibility of 
residual or unmeasured confounding, because of 
the observational nature of the study.

Few people in our cohort followed the strict 
version of the Atkins low-carbohydrate-diet pro-
gram long-term.7 However, the amount of car-
bohydrate in the highest category of carbohydrate 
intake  in  our  cohort  (<29.3%  of  calories)  was 
similar to that consumed by participants in the 
clinical trials of low-carbohydrate diets.25 When 
preset cutoff points were used with more extreme 
variation in macronutrients (<20% of diet as car-
bohydrate, >50% of diet as fat, and >27% of diet 
as protein), our results did not change signifi-
cantly.

The low-carbohydrate-diet score did not have 
a significant long-term effect on weight. On aver-
age, body-mass index increased by approximate-
ly 2.5 units from baseline to the end of follow-
up, regardless of the score. Since the participants 
in the Nurses’ Health Study did not necessarily 
subscribe to a low-carbohydrate diet for the spe-
cific purpose of weight loss, this result is not un-
expected. However, it does indicate that the effects 
of the low-carbohydrate-diet score on outcomes 
in this analysis were not mediated by weight loss.
Any assessment of the association between the 
low-carbohydrate-diet score and a risk of coro-
nary heart disease must take each macronutrient 
into consideration. Different types of fat appear 
to have different effects on the risk of coronary 
heart disease. In epidemiologic studies, saturat-

ed22,26,27 and trans22,28-30 fats have been associated 
with an increased risk of coronary heart disease, 
and polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats 
with decreased risk.22 Total dietary fat, however, 
has not been associated with a risk of coronary 
heart disease. In the Women’s Health Initiative, 
a low-fat dietary pattern was not associated with 
a reduced risk of coronary heart disease during 
an 8-year follow-up.31 Therefore, the increase in 
total fat that is common among women who fol-
low low-carbohydrate diets would not be expected 
to increase the risk of coronary heart disease.32
In low-carbohydrate diets, dietary protein usu-
ally increases at the expense of carbohydrate. In 
our previous analyses, we found that a moder-
ately high protein intake was significantly as-
sociated with a slightly reduced risk of coronary 
heart disease.33 In this study, however, only veg-
etable protein was associated with a significantly 
reduced risk in age-adjusted analyses, and this 
association became nonsignificant in multivari-
ate analyses.

Another possible explanation for the null as-
sociation between a low-carbohydrate-diet score 
and the risk of coronary heart disease relates to 
the amount and quality of carbohydrate present in 
the diet.34 A low-carbohydrate diet tends to have 
a lower dietary glycemic index and glycemic load 
than a high-carbohydrate diet. In a 10-year pro-
spective analysis of the Nurses’ Health Study, Liu 
et al. found a relative risk of coronary heart dis-
ease of 1.98 (95% CI, 1.41 to 2.77) for the com-
parison between the fifth and the first quintile 
of dietary glycemic load.17 In our investigation, we 
found that the direct association between glyce-
mic load and coronary heart disease was much 
stronger than the association between carbohy-
drate and coronary heart disease, probably because 
glycemic load reflects both the quantity and qual-
ity of carbohydrates.

In a meta-analysis of five randomized trials 
comparing a low-carbohydrate diet with a low-fat 
diet for at least 6 months, the low-carbohydrate 
diet was found to have a beneficial effect on HDL 
cholesterol and triglyceride levels but an adverse 
effect on total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol 
levels.25 However, none of the trials have a suffi-

ciently large sample size or a sufficiently long 
duration of follow-up to be used to study the out-
comes of coronary heart disease. In our study, data 
on lipid levels were available for only a small sub-
group of participants. In this group, the low-car-
bohydrate-diet  score  was  not  associated  with 
total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, or LDL choles-
terol levels but was inversely associated with the 
triglyceride level. Therefore, it is not clear wheth-
er these findings are applicable to any low-carbo-
hydrate diet that has an adverse effect on serum 
lipid levels.

Proponents  of  low-carbohydrate  diets  assert 
that ketogenesis (the production of ketone bodies) 
is an important component of the overall effects 
of such diets.7 We were not able to measure keto-
genesis in this investigation. Our investigation also 
did not address other possible adverse consequenc-
es of a low-carbohydrate diet in terms of a decline 
in renal function, osteoporosis, a decrease in mi-
cronutrient and fiber intake, and the risk of ma-
lignant conditions. We have observed previously 
in a subgroup of the Nurses’ Health Study that 
dietary protein was not associated with a decline in 
renal function in women with normal renal func-
tion but may accelerate such a decline in women 
who have mild renal insufficiency.35 Therefore, the 
long-term effects of high protein intake on renal 
function should be investigated further, especially 
among people with compromised renal function, 
such as those with diabetes or renal disease.

In conclusion, diets lower in carbohydrate and 
higher in protein and fat were not associated with 
an increased risk of coronary heart disease in this 
cohort of women. When vegetable sources of fat 
and protein were chosen, these diets were related 
to a lower risk of coronary heart disease.

Fruit and vegetable consumption and stroke: meta-analysis
of cohort studies

Feng J He, Caryl A Nowson, Graham A MacGregor

Summary
Background Increased consumption of fruit and vegetables has been shown to be associated with a reduced risk of
stroke  in  most  epidemiological  studies,  although  the  extent  of  the  association  is  uncertain.  We  quantitatively
assessed the relation between fruit and vegetable intake and incidence of stroke in a meta-analysis of cohort studies. 

Methods We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, and bibliographies of retrieved articles. Studies
were included if they reported relative risks and corresponding 95% CIs of stroke with respect to frequency of fruit
and vegetable intake. 

Findings Eight studies, consisting of nine independent cohorts, met the inclusion criteria. These groups included
257 551 individuals (4917 stroke events) with an average follow-up of 13 years. Compared with individuals who had
less  than  three  servings  of  fruit  and  vegetables  per  day,  the  pooled  relative  risk  of  stroke  was  0·89  (95%  CI
0·83–0·97) for those with three to ﬁve servings per day, and 0·74 (0·69–0·79) for those with more than ﬁve servings
per day. Subgroup analyses showed that fruit and vegetables had a signiﬁcant protective effect on both ischaemic and
haemorrhagic stroke. 

Interpretation Increased fruit and vegetable intake in the range commonly consumed is associated with a reduced
risk of stroke. Our results provide strong support for the recommendations to consume more than ﬁve servings of
fruit and vegetables per day, which is likely to cause a major reduction in strokes.

Introduction
Stroke is the third leading cause of death and the most
common cause of disability in most developed countries.
Primary prevention of stroke is therefore a major public-
health priority. An increase in the consumption of fruit
and vegetables has been advocated for the prevention of
stroke,  other  cardiovascular  diseases,  and  some
cancers.1–3 However,  much  uncertainty  still  exists  about
the  relation  between  the  intake  of  fruit  and  vegetables
and  the  risk  of  stroke.  In  1999,  Ness  and  Powles4,5
undertook a systematic review of ecological, case-control,
and  cohort  studies,  and  showed  that  eight  of  12 cohort
studies  and  three  of  ﬁve  ecological  studies  reported  a
protective  effect  of  fruit  and  vegetables  (or  surrogate
nutrients of fruit and vegetables) on stroke, and one case-
control study showed no association between vitamin C
intake and stroke risk. Because of the variations between
individual  studies  in  the  measures  of  exposure  and
disease, no attempt was made to quantify the association
between  fruit  and  vegetable  intake  and  stroke  risk.
Furthermore,  of  the  studies  in  their  systematic  review,
only a few reported fruit and vegetable intake, and others
assessed  some  selected  nutrients—eg,  vitamin  C,
potassium—rather than fruit and vegetables themselves. 
Nutritional advice is often easier to understand in the
context  of  foods  rather  than  the  nutrients  contained  in
foods. Therefore, the linking of foods or food groups to
outcomes  could  be  especially  important.  Additionally,
since the systematic review by Ness and Powles, several
published  cohort  studies  have  investigated  the  relation
between  fruit  and  vegetable  intake  and  stroke.6–11 We

therefore undertook a meta-analysis of prospective cohort
studies  to  quantitatively  assess  the  association  between
fruit and vegetable intake and the risk of stroke. 

Methods
Literature search
We developed a search strategy (panel) to identify studies
that reported the association between fruit and vegetable
intake and stroke. We searched the electronic databases
MEDLINE (from 1966 to July, 2005) and EMBASE (from
1980 to July, 2005) as well as the Cochrane Library using
the  terms  “fruit”  or  “vegetables”.  Furthermore,  we
reviewed reference lists of original and review articles to
search for more studies. Only those that were published
as full-length articles and in English were considered.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria
For inclusion, studies had to fulﬁl the following criteria:
have a prospective cohort design; report relative risks or
hazard ratios and their corresponding 95% CIs of stroke
relating  to  every  category  of  fruit  and  vegetable  intake;
and  provide  the  frequency  of  fruit  and  vegetable
consumption,  which  allowed  for  standardised  categor-
isation  of  intake.  Studies  were  excluded  if:  case-control
design  was  used;  mixed  healthy  diet  was  reported,  in
which  the  effect  of  fruit  and  vegetables  could  not  be
separated; only surrogate nutrients of fruits or vegetables
were  reported,  and  not  fruits  or  vegetables  themselves;
only two categories of fruit and vegetable intake (eg, daily
vs never) were reported that could not allow for adequate
classiﬁcation  of  intake.  If  multiple  published  reports

Data extraction 
Data were extracted independently by two investigators
(FJH  and  CAN)  and  differences  were  resolved  by
discussion  with  a  third  investigator  (GAM).  Relevant
data 
the  ﬁrst  author’s  name,  year  of
publication, country of origin of the centres, number of
participants,  participants’  age,  duration  of  follow-up,
number  of  events,  methods  used  to  measure  fruit  and
vegetable intake, category amounts of fruit and vegetable
intake,  outcome  assessment,  relative  risks  or  hazard
ratios  of  stroke  and  corresponding  95%  CIs  for  every
category  of  fruit  and  vegetable  intake,  and  covariates
adjusted in the statistical analysis.

Standardisation of fruit and vegetable groups
Since the studies included in this meta-analysis reported
fruit  and  vegetable  consumption  with  different
measurement  units  (eg,  grams,  servings,  or  times  per
day;  tertile,  quartile,  quintile),  and  since  serving  sizes
also  varied  between  studies,  we  standardised  and
grouped  fruit  and  vegetable  consumption  into  three
categories  for  all  studies:  less  than  three  servings  per
day,  three  to  ﬁve  servings  per  day,  and  more  than  ﬁve
servings  per  day.  This  classiﬁcation  was  done  by  a
registered  and  experienced  nutritionist  (CAN).  We
calculated  the  average  weight  of  a  range  of  commonly
consumed  fruits  and  vegetables,  using  serving  size

weights for a 0·5 cup standard serving, as indicated in
the  Composition  of  Foods  Raw,  Processed,  Prepared,
USDA  Nutrient  Database  for  Standard  Reference,
Release 18.

The  average  serving  was  calculated  as  77 g  for  veg-
etables  and  80  g  for  fruit.  These  serving  sizes  were
average  for  a  group  of  commonly  eaten  vegetables  or
fruits  consumed  in  developed  countries.  The  average
serving  per  day  for  fruit  and  vegetables  combined  was
recorded as 391 g, which represents the average intake
for  a  person  who  eats  two  servings  of  fruit  and  three
servings of vegetables per day. For studies that reported
occasions  of  fruit  and  vegetable  consumption  on  a
weekly basis in which serving size was not speciﬁed, we
assumed a usual intake of two servings of fruit and three
servings of vegetables per day.

Statistical analysis 
Relative risks or hazard ratios were used to measure the
relation  between  fruit  and  vegetable  intake  and  stroke;
we converted these values in every study by using their
natural  logarithms,  and  the  standard  errors  (SEs)  were
calculated  from  these  logarithmic  numbers  and  their
corresponding 95% CIs. If the average consumption of
fruit  and  vegetables  from  more  than  one  category  in  a
single study fell into the same category of intake in our
meta-analysis,  then  we  pooled  these  relative  risks  with
inverse variance weight and used the combined estimate
for  that  group.  We  also  combined  relative  risks  if  the
individual  study  reported  risks  based  on  multiple
outcomes (eg, subtypes of stroke were reported only) or
multiple  exposures  (eg,  fruits  and  vegetables  were
reported separately).

ﬁve servings per day, and 0·74 (0·69–0·79, p⬍0·0001) for
those who had more than ﬁve servings per day (ﬁgure 2). 
Compared  with  individuals  who  had  less  than  three
servings of fruit and vegetables per day, those with more
than ﬁve servings per day had a signiﬁcantly reduced risk
of  stroke,  irrespective  of  sex,  duration  of  follow-up,
method  of  dietary  assessment,  dietary 
instrument
administration, or stroke subtype (table 2). However, for
individuals  who  had  three  to  ﬁve  servings  per  day,  the
association  was  only  signiﬁcant  in  some  subgroups
(table 2). Of the eight studies in our meta-analysis, ﬁve (six
cohorts)  reported  the  effects  of  fruit  and  vegetables
separately.6,7,9,10,15 The pooled analysis showed that for the
highest category of intake, both fruits and vegetables had
a signiﬁcant protective effect against stroke, whereas the
association  was  only  signiﬁcant  for  fruits  in  the  middle
category (table 2). 

We  did  a  separate  analysis  by  excluding  the  study  by
Hirvonen and colleagues,7 in which participants were male
smokers  who  took  part  in  a  primary  prevention  trial
looking  at  whether  supplementation  with  ␣ tocopherol,
betacarotene, or both, would reduce the incidence of lung
cancer. Exclusion of that study did not greatly change the
association between fruit and vegetable intake and stroke
risk. Compared with individuals who had less than three
servings of fruit and vegetables per day, the pooled relative
risk of stroke was 0·91 (95% CI 0·82–1·00) for those who
had three to ﬁve servings per day and 0·74 (0·69–0·79) for
those who had more than ﬁve servings per day.

We  plotted  the  natural  logarithms  of  relative  risks
against their SEs (ﬁgure 3). The funnel plot was slightly
asymmetrical for the middle category of fruit and vegetable
intake,  suggesting  a  small  publication  bias  (ie,  small
studies showing no association might be under-reported
in published work). Egger’s regression test suggested no
signiﬁcant asymmetry of the funnel plot for the middle or
highest category of fruit and vegetable intake (p=0·820 and
p=0·533,  respectively),  indicating  no  evidence  of  sub-
stantial publication bias.

Discussion
Our  meta-analysis  has  quantitatively  assessed 
the
relation  between  fruit  and  vegetable  intake  and  stroke
risk. The results show that an increased consumption of
fruit and vegetables is associated with a reduced risk of
stroke.  Compared  with  individuals  who  have  less  than
three  fruit  and  vegetable  servings  per  day,  those  with
three to ﬁve servings per day have an 11% reduction in
the risk of stroke, and those with more than ﬁve servings
per day have a reduction of 26%. These ﬁndings provide
strong  support  for  the  recommendations  encouraging
the  public  to  consume  more  than  ﬁve  servings  of  fruit
and vegetables per day.1–3

The  present  study  is  robust  because  the  prospective
design  should  eliminate  selection  bias  and  recall  bias.
Furthermore, most studies included in our meta-analysis
had a large sample size and long duration of follow-up.
Meta-analysis  of  these  studies  is  a  potentially  powerful
approach  to  assess  the  long-term  effects  of  fruit  and
vegetable  intake  on  stroke  risk.  Although  outcome
evidence from long-term randomised trials is ideal, these
studies  are  extremely  difﬁcult  to  implement  on  a
practical  basis  and,  to  our  knowledge,  no  one  has
planned to undertake such trials. 

that  both 

Our  meta-analysis  shows 

fruits  and
vegetables  have  a  signiﬁcant  protective  effect  against
stroke. An important point is whether different types of
fruits  and  vegetables  have  an  equal  protective  effect.
Published information on this issue is scarce,6,9 and we
cannot say whether some types of fruits and vegetables
are better than others. We believe that an overall increase
in  the  consumption  of  fruit  and  vegetables  will  be
beneﬁcial in reducing the risk of stroke, and could also
reduce other cardiovascular disease and some cancers. 

Our study had several potential limitations. First, as in
all observational studies of diet and disease, exclusion of
potential  biases  due  to  other  lifestyles  is  difﬁcult.  For
instance, individuals who eat more fruit and vegetables
will probably have lower rates of smoking, a lower intake
of salt and saturated fat, higher levels ofphysical exercise,
and are less likely to be overweight, than those who do
not  eat  many  fruit  or  vegetables.6,10 Such  healthy  diets
and  lifestyles  have  been  shown  to  reduce  the  risk  of
stroke. A meta-analysis is not able to solve problems with
confounding  factors  that  could  be  inherent  in  the
included  studies.  However,  all  studies  included  in  our

mainly  by  lowering  the  amount  of  oxidised  LDL
available to be incorporated into lesions. However, long-
term intervention studies of vitamin C, vitamin E, and
betacarotene have failed to show any beneﬁcial effect on
total  stroke  incidence  or  mortality.28,29 Therefore,  the
contribution of dietary folate, ﬁbre, and antioxidants to
a  reduced  risk  of  stroke  with  an  increased  fruit  and
vegetable intake is only speculative.

that  a  higher 

In  conclusion,  our  meta-analysis  of  cohort  studies
demonstrates 
intake  of  fruit  and
vegetables is associated with a lower risk of stroke. The
average  fruit  and  vegetable  intake  in  most  developed
countries  is  about  three  servings  per  day,  and  current
recommendations encourage ﬁve or more servings per
day.  Our  results  provide  strong  support  for  these
recommendations. If these goals were achieved, stroke
morbidity and mortality would be greatly reduced. Such
diet  modiﬁcations  would  also  reduce  other  cardiovas-
cular diseases30 and some cancers.31

meta-analysis  have  adjusted  for  major  confounding
factors,  which  should  reduce  the  potential  bias  due  to
these  lifestyle  factors.  Second,  of  the  eight  studies
included in the meta-analysis, only three accounted for
the  changes  of  dietary  intake  over  time,  and  in  most
studies,  the  dietary  assessment  was  only  made  at
baseline.  The  inherent  measurement  error  in  these
assessments  could  cause  bias  to  the  results.  However,
any bias from measurement error in the dietary intake
would probably tend to attenuate the protective effect of
fruit  and  vegetables,  and  the  reductions  in  stroke  risk
seen  in  our  study  could  have  been  conservative
estimates. Third, we could not exclude potential biases
due to the misclassiﬁcation of fruit and vegetable intake
as  dietary  assessment, 
the  number  of  exposure
categories,  and  the  reference  category  varied  among
individual studies. However, our subgroup analyses did
not support the presence of major confounding effects
by these factors. 

The protective effects of fruit and vegetables on stroke
have a strong biological basis. Fruit and vegetables are
rich sources of potassium, folate, ﬁbre, and antioxidants
(vitamin C, betacarotene, and ﬂavonoids). Randomised
trials  have  shown  that  increasing  fruit  and  vegetable
consumption,  with  a  subsequent  rise  in  24-h  urinary
potassium 
reduces  blood  pressure;17
potassium  supplementation  has  also  been  shown  to
have a substantial and similar blood-pressure-lowering
effect  to  that  of  fruit  and  vegetables.18–20 Since  raised
blood pressure is the major cause of stroke, the blood-
pressure-lowering  effect  of  potassium  could  be  one  of
the major mechanisms contributing to a reduced risk of
stroke with an increased fruit and vegetable intake. 

excretion, 

Furthermore,  increasing  evidence  from  epidemio-
logical  studies  in  human  beings  and  experimental
studies in animals suggests that potassium could have a
direct effect on stroke independent of its effect on blood
pressure.21 The mechanisms for this effect are not fully
understood.  Experimental  studies  in  animals  suggest
that  potassium  could  have  inhibitory  effects  on  free-
radical formation, vascular smooth muscle proliferation,
and  arterial  thrombosis.22 Potassium  could  also  reduce
macrophage adherence to the vascular wall and thereby
contribute  to  the  reduction  of  vascular  lesions  and
stroke risk.23

Another  possibly  beneﬁcial  nutrient  contained  in
fruits  and  vegetables  is  folate.  Dietary  folate  is  a
determinant of plasma homocysteine levels, and several
studies  have  shown  an  association  between  plasma
homocysteine concentrations and the risk of stroke.24,25
Dietary  ﬁbre  might  also  possibly  contribute  to  the
reduction in stroke risk by lowering blood pressure and
cholesterol.26 Antioxidants  are  another  potential  medi-
ator  of  the  beneﬁcial  effects  of  fruits  and  vegetables.
Randomised trials have shown that fruit and vegetable
consumption  increases  plasma  antioxidants.27 Anti-
oxidants  have  been  shown  to  reduce  atherosclerosis,

Sweetened Beverage Consumption, Incident Coronary Heart

Disease, and Biomarkers of Risk in Men

Lawrence de Koning, PhD; Vasanti S. Malik, ScD; Mark D. Kellogg, PhD; Eric B. Rimm, ScD;

Walter C. Willett, MD, DrPH; Frank B. Hu, MD, PhD

Background—Sugar-sweetened beverage consumption is associated with weight gain and risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus.
Few studies have tested for a relationship with coronary heart disease (CHD) or intermediate biomarkers. The role of
artificially sweetened beverages is also unclear.

Methods and Results—We performed an analysis of the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study, a prospective cohort study
including 42 883 men. Associations of cumulatively averaged sugar-sweetened (eg, sodas) and artificially sweetened (eg, diet
sodas) beverage intake with incident fatal and nonfatal CHD (myocardial infarction) were examined with proportional hazard
models. There were 3683 CHD cases over 22 years of follow-up. Participants in the top quartile of sugar-sweetened beverage
intake had a 20% higher relative risk of CHD than those in the bottom quartile (relative risk⫽1.20; 95% confidence interval,
1.09–1.33; P for trend ⬍0.01) after adjustment for age, smoking, physical activity, alcohol, multivitamins, family history, diet
quality, energy intake, body mass index, pre-enrollment weight change, and dieting. Artificially sweetened beverage
consumption was not significantly associated with CHD (multivariate relative risk⫽1.02; 95% confidence interval, 0.93–1.12;
P for trend⫽0.28). Adjustment for self-reported high cholesterol, high triglycerides, high blood pressure, and diagnosed type
2 diabetes mellitus slightly attenuated these associations. Intake of sugar-sweetened but not artificially sweetened beverages
was significantly associated with increased plasma triglycerides, C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor
receptors 1 and 2 and decreased high-density lipoprotein, lipoprotein(a), and leptin (P⬍0.02).

Conclusions—Consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages was associated with increased risk of CHD and some adverse
changes in lipids, inflammatory factors, and leptin. Artificially sweetened beverage intake was not associated with CHD
risk or biomarkers. (Circulation. 2012;125:1735-1741.)

Consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages has repeatedly

been associated with weight gain and type 2 diabetes
mellitus (T2D).1–3 However, few studies have investigated the
relationship between sugar-sweetened beverage intake and inci-
dent cardiovascular disease (CVD). Such a relationship might be
expected, given their association with adiposity and T2D. In an
analysis of the Nurses’ Health Study, sugar-sweetened beverage
intake was associated with incident coronary heart disease
(CHD) even after adjustment for these factors,4 which suggests
that other mechanisms are involved.

cardiometabolic dysfunction.5–7 In an analysis of the Health
Professionals Follow-Up Study, we found strong evidence that
such relationships are due to confounding and reverse causality.8
The primary objective of this study was to further define the
association between sugar-sweetened and artificially sweetened
beverage intake and CHD in the Health Professionals Follow-Up
Study, a large prospective cohort study of men. The secondary
objective was to identify a possible mechanism by adjusting for
potential mediators of this relationship and measuring cross-
sectional associations between beverage intake and blood lipids,
hemoglobin A1c, inflammatory factors, and adipokines.

Methods

Although artificially sweetened beverages such as diet soda
have been suggested as alternatives, some prospective cohort
studies have linked the consumption of these beverages to

40–75 years) male dentists, pharmacists, optometrists, osteopath physi-
cians, podiatrists, and veterinarians. Approximately 97% of participants
were of white European descent. Questionnaires were mailed to partic-
ipants at baseline and biennially to assess health and lifestyle traits (94%
response rate). The Health Professionals Follow-up Study was approved
by the Harvard School of Public Health Institutional Review board, and
all participants gave written consent.

Diagnostics) with an immunoturbidimetric assay (Denka Seiken).
Interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor receptors 1 and -2 (TNFr1 and
TNFr2), intracellular adhesion molecule-1, and vascular cell adhe-
sion molecule-1 were measured by ELISAs (R&D Systems, Minne-
apolis, MN). Plasma adiponectin and leptin concentrations were
measured by competitive radioimmunoassay (Linco Research, St.
Charles, MO). Coefficients of variation for most assays were ⬍10%.

Beverage Intake
A semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire was sent to partic-
ipants every 4 years. The food frequency questionnaire asked
participants to report their usual intake (never to ⱖ6 times per day)
of a standard 355-mL (12-oz) serving (1 glass, can, or bottle) of
sugar-sweetened (caffeinated colas, caffeine-free colas, other car-
bonated sugar-sweetened beverages, noncarbonated sugar-sweetened
beverages [fruit punches, lemonades, or other fruit drinks]) and
artificially sweetened (caffeinated low-calorie beverages and non-
carbonated low-calorie beverages) beverages. Frequency of intake
was multiplied by the nutrient content for each food item and
summed to produce daily intakes of nutrients and energy.

In a validation study,

intake of cola was highly correlated
(deattenuated for measurement error) with mean intake from two
7-day diet records (0.84 for sugar-sweetened, 0.74 for artificially
sweetened). Intake of noncolas had poorer correlations with intake
from 7-day diet records (0.55 for carbonated noncolas, 0.40 for fruit
punches/lemonades/other fruit drinks).9

Blood Samples
Between 1993 and 1995, 18 225 participants provided a blood
sample. Blood was collected in tubes containing liquid EDTA and
returned to the laboratory on ice via an overnight courier, where the
samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen. Participants were subjects in
nested case-control studies (eg, T2D, CVD, Parkinson disease,
prostate cancer, pancreatic cancer, colon cancer) or healthy men who
were randomly selected on the basis of their alcohol-consumption
patterns for a study on alcohol intake and biomarkers of ischemic
heart disease. Nearly 60% of participants fasted for ⬎9 hours.

Ascertainment of End Points
Incident CHD was defined as nonfatal or fatal myocardial infarction.
Participants were asked in a biennial follow-up questionnaire whether
they had experienced a myocardial infarction between January 1986 and
December 2008. When an event was reported, we asked permission
from the participant to obtain medical records for confirmation. Nonfatal
myocardial infarction was defined by use of the World Health Organi-
zation criteria, which required clinical symptoms and diagnostic
changes on ECG or elevated cardiac enzymes. Death ascertainment was
performed by searching the National Death Index,10 by family mem-
bers’ responses to follow-up questionnaires, or by reports from partic-
ipants’ professional organizations. We requested access to medical
records, autopsy reports, and death certificates to confirm all suspected
deaths caused by myocardial infarction. Fatal myocardial infarction was
confirmed by medical records or autopsy reports. Death certificates
alone were not considered sufficient to confirm myocardial infarction as
the cause of death unless family members or medical records indicated
that the participant was diagnosed with coronary artery disease before
death but after admission into the study.

Measurement of Biomarkers
Plasma concentrations of total, high-density lipoprotein, and direct
low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides were measured
by standard methods with reagents from Roche Diagnostics (India-
napolis, IN) and Genzyme (Cambridge, MA).11,12 Lipoprotein(a)
was measured with a turbidimetric assay on the Hitachi 911 analyzer
(Roche Diagnostics) using reagents and calibrators from Denka
Seiken (Niigata, Japan). This is the only commercial assay not
affected by Kringle type 2 repeats.13 Red blood cell glycohemoglo-
bin (hemoglobin A1c) was measured by a temperature-controlled
high-performance liquid chromatography method.14 C-reactive pro-
tein (CRP) was measured on the Hitachi 911 analyzer (Roche

Statistical Analysis
Participants with a history of T2D, CVD (heart attack, stroke, angina,
coronary artery bypass graft), and cancer (except nonmelanoma skin
cancer) at baseline were excluded. Participants with an implausible
energy intake (⬍335 or ⬎1758 MJ/d) were also excluded, leaving
42 883 participants for analysis (see the online-only Data Supple-
ment for a flowchart showing all exclusions).

Person-time was calculated from the return of the baseline
questionnaire until December 31, 2008, death, loss to follow-up, or
diagnosis of CHD (fatal or nonfatal), whichever occurred first. Cox
proportional hazard models with time-varying covariates with age as
the time scale were used for all analyses. Cumulative averages of
beverage intake and dietary variables were calculated at each time
point and were not updated after a diagnosis of cancer or CVD to
limit recall bias. Other covariates were updated at each time point.
This was compared with a secondary analysis that used only baseline
dietary information. For missing data, the last value was carried
forward for body mass index (BMI), smoking, and physical activity.
Beverage intake was grouped into fourths (quartiles), and the Wald
test (1 df) of the median value in quartiles was used to evaluate linear
trends. Models were adjusted for smoking (never, past, current 1–15
cigarettes/d, current ⬎15 cigarettes/d, missing), physical activity (quin-
tiles of metabolic equivalents per week, missing), alcohol
intake
(abstainers, 0–9.9 g/d, 10–20 g/d, ⬎20 g/d, missing), multivitamin use,
family history of CHD, pre-enrollment (1981–1986) weight gain (0,
0.9–1.8, 2.3–4.1, 4.5–6.4, 6.8–8.6, 9.1–13.2, or ⱖ13.6 kg) or weight
loss (0, 0.9–1.8, 2.3–4.1, 4.5–6.4, or ⱖ6.8 kg), adherence to a low-calorie
diet (1992), total energy intake (quintiles), and BMI (⬍23, 23–23.9,
24–24.9, 25–26.9, 27–28.9, 29–30.9, 31–32.9, 33–34.9, ⬎35 kg/m2,
missing). Smoking status was missing in 3.9% of participants, whereas
physical activity was missing in 0.5% and BMI in 2.2% of participants.

We also adjusted for the alternative Healthy Eating Index (quin-
tiles)15 to help rule out confounding by other dietary factors. The
alternative Healthy Eating Index ranks participants according to their
adherence to a healthy dietary pattern, awarding points for higher
intakes of fruit, vegetables, nuts/soy, cereal fiber (fiber from cereals,
eg, wheat) polyunsaturated:saturated fat, white:red meat; moderate
alcohol intake, daily multivitamin use, and low intakes of trans fat.
Potential mediators (updated values for self-reported high cholester-
ol, high triglycerides, high blood pressure, and a past confirmed
diagnosis of T2D) were adjusted for in a separate model.

We tested for nonlinear associations using cubic splines (5 knots),
and in a sensitivity analysis, we excluded CHD cases occurring
during the first 4 years of follow-up. This was done to evaluate the
influence of subclinical disease on associations. We also performed
an 8-year latency analysis in which diet was updated only after 8
years to determine the role of elapsed time between the assessment
of beverage intake and CHD.

Analyses were stratified by age (ⱖ65 versus ⬍65 years), smoking
(ever versus never), alcohol consumption (drinker versus abstainer),
physical activity (low [quintiles 1 and 2], medium [quintiles 3 and 4],
high [quintile 5]), family history of T2D (yes versus no), BMI (⬍25,
25–29.9, ⱖ30 kg/m2), past diagnosis of CHD (yes versus no), self-
reported high triglycerides (yes versus no), high cholesterol (yes versus
no), and high blood pressure (yes versus no). We also stratified for all
combinations of mediators (eg, high triglycerides plus T2D versus
neither). Interaction tests were performed with the Wald test of cross-prod-
uct terms (eg, median beverage intake by median BMI in categories).

molecule-1, adiponectin, and leptin were examined in 1994 by use of
linear regression with a robust variance estimator. As a result of
skewed distributions for CRP and interleukin-6, these variables were
log transformed. All analyses were adjusted for the case-control
study from which blood samples were drawn, and associations were
evaluated for differences by fasting state using cross-product terms
(fasting by sugar-sweetened beverages).

SAS version 9.1 was used for all analyses. A 2-tailed value of

P⬍0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Results

Baseline Characteristics
At baseline, participants reported consuming fewer sugar-
sweetened beverages (2.5 per week, 0.36 per day, SD⫽0.61)
than artificially sweetened beverages (3.4 per week, 0.49 per
day, SD⫽0.94).

Consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages was associated
with several unhealthy lifestyle traits at baseline, including a
higher prevalence of current smoking and lower physical activ-
ity, but a decreased family history of CHD (Table 1). It was also
associated with a lower overall diet quality (alternative Healthy
Eating Index) and intake of cereal fiber, protein, alcohol, and
multivitamins but a higher intake of carbohydrate, glycemic load

(product of glycemic index [white bread as reference food] and
carbohydrate), total fat, trans fat, and energy (Table 1). Sugar-
sweetened beverage consumption was associated with higher
pre-enrollment weight gain, decreased pre-enrollment weight
loss, and a lower adherence to a low-calorie diet (Table 1).
Conversely, artificially sweetened beverage consumption was
associated with some healthy lifestyle traits, including a lower
prevalence of current smoking and higher physical activity, but
a greater family history of CHD (Table 1). It was also associated
with a higher prevalence of high triglycerides, high cholesterol.
and high blood pressure (Table 1). Artificially sweetened bev-
erage consumption was associated with higher overall diet
quality (alternative Healthy Eating Index); a lower intake of
carbohydrate, cereal fiber, and glycemic load; but a higher intake
of protein, total fat, saturated fat, trans fat, and multivitamins.
Artificially sweetened beverage intake was also associated with
higher pre-enrollment weight gain, pre-enrollment weight loss,
adherence to a low-calorie diet, and BMI (Table 1).

Cox Regression
There were 3683 incident cases of CHD over 22 years of
follow-up (790 852 person-years). Sugar-sweetened beverage

Q indicates quartile; CHD, coronary heart disease; aHEI, alternative Healthy Eating Index; BMI, body mass index; and T2D, type 2 diabetes mellitus. Relative risks
(95% confidence intervals) are shown. Multivariate models are adjusted for age, smoking (categories, missing), physical activity (quintiles of metabolic equivalents
a week, missing), alcohol intake (categories), multivitamin use, and family history of CHD. Pre-enrollment weight change includes variables for weight gain (categories)
and weight loss (categories). The variable for low-calorie diet is for adherence to a low-calorie diet in 1992. Previous T2D refers to any past diagnosis of T2D, whereas
high triglycerides, high cholesterol, and high blood pressure are self-reported.

intake was associated with an increased risk of CHD (top versus
bottom quartile, relative risk⫽1.21, 95% confidence interval,
1.10–1.33; P for trend ⬍0.01; Table 2); however, artificially
sweetened beverages were not (relative risk⫽1.04, 95% confi-
dence interval, 0.96–1.15; P for trend⫽0.05; Table 2).

Adjustment for smoking, physical activity, alcohol intake,
multivitamin use, and family history attenuated the association
for sugar-sweetened beverages but strengthened the association
for artificially sweetened beverages (Table 2). Further adjust-
ment for pre-enrollment weight change and adherence to a
low-calorie diet in 1992 strengthened the association for sugar-
sweetened beverages but weakened it for artificially sweetened
beverages (Table 2). Adjustment for dietary factors had the
opposite effect, but after adjustment for BMI, the association for
artificially sweetened beverages was no longer significant (Table
2). Further adjustment for a past diagnosis of T2D, high blood
lipids, and high blood pressure only slightly attenuated these
associations (Table 2). Cubic splines revealed no evidence of
nonlinearity in these associations (P for curvature ⬎0.21).

Using continuous intake yielded similar results (Table 3). For
each additional serving per day, sugar-sweetened beverage
consumption was associated with a 19% to 25% increased risk
of CHD (P⬍0.02; Table 3). Overall, artificially sweetened
beverages were not associated with risk of CHD (P⫽0.05).

Artificially sweetened carbonated noncolas were associated with
increased risk; however, their contribution to intake was small.
Repeating this analysis with continuous covariates did not
substantially alter the results (data not shown). Associations
were similar when baseline beverage intake was used, after the

latency analysis in which diet was updated after 8 years (data not
shown). No significant interactions with age, smoking, alcohol,
physical activity, family history, BMI, or any mediators or their
combinations were observed (data not shown).

Blood Biomarkers
Intake of sugar-sweetened beverages was associated with
significantly higher triglycerides, CRP, interleukin-6, TNFr1,
and TNFr2 and lower high-density lipoprotein, lipoprotein(a),
and leptin (Table 4). Associations did not differ significantly
according to fasting status (data not shown).

Discussion

In this analysis, consumption of sugar-sweetened but not
artificially sweetened beverages was associated with an
increased risk of CHD. Sugar-sweetened beverage consump-
tion was associated with some adverse changes in blood
lipids, inflammatory factors, and leptin.

Sugar-sweetened beverages provide ⬇63 MJ per serving16
and are less satiating than solid foods,17–19 which make them
important determinants of BMI. In a pooled analysis of the
Health Professionals Follow-Up Study and the Nurses Study I
and II, an increase in sugar-sweetened beverage intake was
associated with a 0.45-kg greater 4-year weight gain in men and
women.3 Conversely, in the PREMIER lifestyle intervention and
weight loss trial, a reduced intake of sugar-sweetened beverages
was associated with significant weight loss.20 In trials among
overweight children and adolescents, subjects randomized to
consume fewer sugar-sweetened beverages lost significantly
more weight than participants in control groups.21,22 Sugar-
sweetened beverages also have a high carbohydrate content and
glycemic load, which may elevate the risk of T2D23 and lead to

unfavorable changes in blood lipids independently of BMI. In a
meta-analysis of 60 trials, replacing dietary fat with carbohy-
drate increased triglycerides and lowered high-density lipopro-
tein.24 A similar effect is attributed to fructose from sugar-
sweetened beverages, which increases de novo lipogenesis25 but
also the synthesis of uric acid, which may elevate blood
pressure.26 In the PREMIER trial, a reduction in sugar-
sweetened beverage intake was associated with a significant
decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressures.27 Finally,
advanced glycation end products present in the caramel coloring
of colas may play a role as they decrease insulin sensitivity in
rodents.28 In light of this evidence and the fact that in 2004
sugar-sweetened beverages made up ⬇7% of the total daily
energy intake of Americans,29 sugar-sweetened beverages are
important risk factors for CVD.

In this study, consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages was
significantly associated with an increased risk of CHD. This was
after adjustment for multiple lifestyle-related factors, including
overall diet quality and BMI, which were strong risk factors for
CHD. We also adjusted for prior weight change and dieting,
which could motivate participants to switch from sugar-
sweetened to artificially sweetened beverages.30 For a 1-serving-
per-day increase in sugar-sweetened beverage intake, the risk of
CHD increased by 19% (relative risk⫽1.19; 95% confidence
interval, 1.11–1.28; P⬍0.01). Similar results were observed in
the Nurses’ Health Study (n⫽88 520; cases, n⫽3105; follow-up,
24 years) in which a 1-serving-per-day increase in sugar-
sweetened beverage intake was associated with a 15% increase
in risk (relative risk⫽1.15; 95% confidence interval, 1.07–1.20;
P⬍0.01).4 The average baseline intake of sugar-sweetened
beverages was slightly higher in the Nurses’ Health Study (0.41
servings per day) than in the Health Professionals Follow-Up
Study (0.36 servings per day).4

Our results were stable after a number of sensitivity analyses.
Using baseline dietary intake did not change the results, and
associations were still significant after the exclusion of early
cases of CHD, which could be a marker of preexisting disease
and a more recent change in beverage intake. Results were
essentially the same in an 8-year latency analyses. We found no
differences in associations among different strata, including past
diagnosis of T2D, self-reported high triglycerides, high choles-
terol, high blood pressure, or their combinations.

As in the Nurses’ Health Study,4 we found that

the
relationship between sugar-sweetened beverage consumption
and CHD was not explained by conventional mediators. After
adjustment for a past diagnosis of T2D, self-reported high
triglycerides, self-reported high cholesterol, and self-reported
high blood pressure, the relationship was only slightly atten-
uated. This suggests that sugar-sweetened beverages may
affect CHD risk above and beyond traditional risk factors.

We looked for possible biochemical mediators in our study
and found that sugar-sweetened beverage consumption was
associated with higher triglycerides and lower high-density
lipoprotein. This is consistent with results from a meta-analysis
of intervention studies evaluating the replacement of fat with
carbohydrate on blood lipids,24 as well as other trials of fructose
intake.31 We found a slight decrease in lipoprotein(a) with
increased consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages; however,
the reason for this finding is unclear. Importantly, sugar-
sweetened beverage consumption was associated with increased
levels of several circulating inflammatory factors, including
CRP, interleukin-6, TNFr1, and TNFr2. In the Nurses’ Health
Study, a dietary pattern rich in sugar-sweetened beverages was
associated with higher levels of TNFr2, CRP, and interleukin-6.32
These findings have been validated in a recent trial in which low
to moderate intake of sugar-sweetened beverages increased
inflammatory factors such as CRP.33 In this study, fructose-
enriched beverages produced the greatest increases in inflam-
matory factors.33 Inflammation is a key factor in the pathogen-
esis of CVD and cardiometabolic disease34 and could represent
an additional pathway by which sugar-sweetened beverages
influence risk. Intake of sugar-sweetened beverages could stim-
ulate an inflammatory response through hyperglycemia, which
can activate the electron transport chain to produce superoxide
radicals.35 Fructose also stimulates transcription of inflammatory
factors by activating nuclear factor-␬B in mice.36 Finally, we
observed an inverse relationship between sugar-sweetened bev-
erage intake and leptin. Small trials indicate that fructose-
supplemented meals lead to poor stimulation of leptin, lower
satiety, higher energy intake, and weight gain.37

We found no evidence to suggest that overall consumption of
artificially sweetened beverages was associated with CHD risk
or changes in biomarkers; however, noncarbonated artificially
sweetened beverages were associated with increased risk in an
analysis of continuous intake. The reason for this is unclear,
especially because we found no significant associations between
artificially sweetened beverages and biomarkers. Previous stud-
ies have found significant associations between artificially
sweetened beverage consumption, cardiometabolic dysfunction,
and T2D5–7; however,
these findings are probably due to
confounding and reverse causality. In the Health Professionals
Follow-Up Study, participants appear to be consuming artifi-

cially sweetened beverages as part of a weight-loss strategy or in
response to the diagnosis of a chronic condition. In a previous
analysis of this study, sugar-sweetened beverage consumption
was associated with an increased risk of T2D, but this was not
significant after adjustment for BMI, pre-enrollment weight
change, and dieting.8 We saw a similar pattern of attenuation in
the present analysis; however, the magnitude of confounding
was smaller. Our results highlight the need for cautious inter-
pretation of studies reporting positive associations between diet
drinks and cardiometabolic and cardiovascular outcomes.

Our study has some limitations. First, dietary intakes were
measured with some error. Second, participants in our study may
be dissimilar to those living in the general population. For
example, intake of sugar-sweetened beverages was much lower
in our study (mean, 0.36 servings per day) than in US adults
(mean, ⬎1 serving per day).38 However, the similarity of the
sugar-sweetened beverage–CHD relationship across various
strata suggests that it is likely to be the same in different
populations. Third, we cannot exclude the possibility of unmea-
sured and residual confounding. To address this issue, we
adjusted for a wide range of potential confounders and used
continuous covariates in an attempt to control residual confound-
ing. We could not account for residual confounding resulting
from missing smoking, physical activity, and BMI data. Fourth,
we tested for a large number of cross-sectional associations.
However, our results are supported by other studies, which
suggests that they are not due to chance.

Conclusions

Consumption of sugar-sweetened but not artificially sweetened
beverages was associated with a significantly increased risk of
CHD. Sugar-sweetened beverage intake was also associated
with adverse changes in some blood lipids, inflammatory fac-
tors, and leptin. These results and those from other observational
studies and trials support recommendations to reduce the con-
sumption of sugar-sweetened beverages to prevent CVD.

CLINICAL PERSPECTIVE

Consuming sugar-sweetened beverages such as cola puts individuals at an increased risk for weight gain and type 2
diabetes mellitus, both of which are risk factors for coronary heart disease (CHD). However, few studies have assessed the
relationship between sugar-sweetened beverage consumption and CHD events. In our analysis of the Health Professionals
Follow-Up Study, a prospective cohort study that includes a well-characterized population of ⬎40 000 men, we found that
sugar-sweetened beverage consumption was associated with a higher risk of CHD independently of body mass index, type
2 diabetes mellitus, and other established cardiovascular risk factors. For each additional serving per day, sugar-sweetened
beverages were associated with a 19% increased risk of CHD. We also found that sugar-sweetened beverage consumption
was associated with adverse changes in blood lipids, higher circulating inflammatory factors, and lower leptin. These
biomarker changes may help to explain why sugar-sweetened beverage consumption is a risk factor for CHD and, in the
case of leptin, obesity. Conversely, consumption of artificially sweetened beverages such as diet soda was not associated
with CHD risk or biomarkers in our study but was associated with baseline comorbidities, higher body mass index,
pre-enrollment weight change, and dieting, which could lead to confounding.

ABSTRACT
Background: Metabolic  studies  suggest  that  saturated  fatty
acids differ in their effects on blood lipids.
Objective: The  objective  was  to  examine  the  associations
between intakes of individual saturated fatty acids and their food
sources in relation to the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD).
Design: This was a prospective cohort study of 80 082 women in
the Nurses’ Health Study aged 34–59 y. Subjects had no known
cardiovascular disease, cancer, hypercholesterolemia, or diabetes,
and completed validated food-frequency questionnaires in 1980.
Results: During 14 y of follow-up, we documented 939 incident
cases  of  major  CHD  events.  In  multivariate  analyses  in  which
age, smoking, and other covariates were controlled for, intakes
of short- to medium-chain saturated fatty acids (4:0–10:0) were
not  significantly  associated  with  the  risk  of  CHD.  In  contrast,
intakes  of  longer-chain  saturated  fatty  acids  (12:0–18:0)  were
each separately associated with a small increase in risk. The mul-
tivariate RR for a 1% energy increase from stearic acid was 1.19
(95% CI: 1.02, 1.37). The ratio of polyunsaturated to saturated
fat was strongly and inversely associated with CHD risk (multi-
variate  RR  for  a  comparison  of  the  highest  with  the  lowest
deciles: 0.58;  95%  CI: 0.41, 0.83;  P for  trend  <  0.0001).  Con-
versely, higher  ratios  of  red  meat  to  poultry  and  fish  con-
sumption  and  of  high-fat  to  low-fat  dairy  consumption  were
associated with significantly greater risk.
Conclusion: A distinction between stearic acid and other satu-
rated  fats  does  not  appear  to  be  important  in  dietary  advice  to
reduce CHD risk, in part because of the high correlation between
stearic  acid  and  other  saturated  fatty  acids  in  typical  diets.

INTRODUCTION

Migration  studies  and  international  comparisons  suggest  a
strong positive association between saturated fat intake and risk
of  coronary  heart  disease  (CHD)  (1, 2).  In  metabolic  studies,
diets high in saturated fat and low in polyunsaturated fat increase
blood  cholesterol  concentrations  (3, 4).  However, different
classes  of  saturated  fatty  acids  can  have  different  effects  on

plasma lipid and lipoprotein concentrations (5). Specifically, sat-
urated  fatty  acids  with  12–16  carbon  atoms  tend  to  increase
plasma  total  and  LDL-cholesterol  concentrations, whereas
stearic  acid  (18:0)  does  not  have  a  cholesterol-raising  effect
compared with oleic acid (18:1). However, 18:0 may lower HDL
and  increase  lipoprotein(a)  [Lp(a)]  concentrations  (6).  Among
the cholesterol-raising saturated fatty acids, myristic acid (14:0)
appears to be more potent than lauric acid (12:0) or palmitic acid
(16:0) (5, 7), but the data are not entirely consistent (8).

The  differential  effects  of  specific  saturated  fats  on  plasma
lipids and lipoproteins imply that these fats may have different
effects  on  the  risk  of  CHD.  So  far, epidemiologic  studies  have
assessed only the association of the risk of CHD with total satu-
rated fatty acids; to our knowledge, no data are available regard-
ing the associations between individual saturated fatty acids and
the risk of CHD. Recently, we reported a modest positive asso-
ciation  between  saturated  fat  intake  and  the  risk  of  CHD  in
women participating in the Nurses’ Health Study (9). The pres-
ent analysis examines in detail the relations of intake of specific
saturated fatty acids and their major food sources with the inci-
dence of CHD during 14 y of follow-up.

follow-up  questionnaires  have  been  sent  to  update  information
on potential risk factors and to identify newly diagnosed cases of
CHD and other diseases.

In 1980, a 61-item food-frequency questionnaire was included
to assess intakes of specific fats and other nutrients. In 1984, the
food-frequency questionnaire was expanded to include 116 food
items. Similar questionnaires were used to update dietary intakes
in 1986 and 1990. The primary change in the revised question-
naire  was  the  creation  of  individual  questions  about  groups  of
nutritionally similar food items that had been collapsed into sin-
gle  items  on  the  more  compressed  original  questionnaire.  The
reproducibility and validity of the food-frequency questionnaires
were described in detail elsewhere (11, 12). In validation studies
among  subsamples  of  the  main  study, correlation  coefficients
between  energy-adjusted  saturated  fat  intakes  derived  from  the
61-item  and  116-item  food-frequency  questionnaires  and  from
multiple, 1-wk dietary records (after within-person variation in
the diet records was accounted for) were 0.65 and 0.68, respec-
tively (L Sampson, E Rimm, M Stampfer, B Rosner, W Willett,
unpublished observations, 1997).

To calculate intakes of specific saturated fatty acids and other
nutrients, a commonly used unit or portion size for each food (eg,
one egg or one slice of bread) was specified and the participant
was asked how often on average during the previous year she had
consumed  that  amount.  Nine  responses  were  possible, ranging
from “never” to “‡ 6 times/d.” Nutrient intakes were computed by
multiplying the frequency of consumption of each unit of food by
the nutrient content of the specified portions. Composition values
for  individual  saturated  fatty  acids  and  other  nutrients  were
obtained from US Department of Agriculture sources (13).

After up to 4 mailings, 98 462 women returned the 1980 dietary
questionnaire. We excluded those who left ‡ 10 items blank, those
with implausibly low or high scores for total food or energy intake
[ie, < 2094 kJ (500 kcal) or > 14 650 kJ (3500 kcal)/d], and those
with previously diagnosed cancer, angina, myocardial infarction,
stroke, or  other  cardiovascular  diseases.  Women  reporting  high
serum  cholesterol  concentrations  or  diabetes  were  excluded
because these disorders are associated with a risk of CHD and also
could have caused the women to change their diets. The ﬁnal 1980
baseline population consisted of 80 082 women.

Ascertainment of endpoint

The primary endpoint for this study was nonfatal myocardial
infarction or fatal coronary disease occurring after the return of
the  1980  questionnaire  but  before  1  June  1994.  We  sought  to
review  medical  records  for  all  such  reports.  Records  were
reviewed by study physicians with no knowledge of the subjects’
self-reported  risk  factor  status.  Myocardial  infarction  was  con-
firmed  by  using World  Health  Organization  criteria: symptoms
plus  either  diagnostic  electrocardiographic  changes  or  elevated
cardiac  enzymes  (14).  Infarctions  that  required  hospital  admis-
sion  and  for  which  confirmatory  information  was  obtained  by
interview or letter, but for which no medical records were avail-
able, were designated as probable (17%). We included all con-
firmed and probable cases in our analyses because results were
the same after probable cases were excluded.

Deaths  were  identified  from  state  vital  records  and  the
National  Death  Index  or  were  reported  by  next  of  kin  or  the
postal  system;  follow-up  for  deaths  was  > 98%  complete  (15).
Fatal coronary disease was defined as fatal myocardial infarction
if this was confirmed by hospital records or autopsy, or if coro-

nary disease was listed as the cause of death on the death certifi-
cate and there was evidence of previous coronary disease. CHD
cases  were  designated  as  presumed  if  the  underlying  cause  on
the  death  certificate  was  CHD  but  no  records  were  available;
these  cases  constituted  <14.7%  of  fatal  CHD  cases.  Analyses
limited to confirmed cases yielded similar results, although with
less precision. We also included sudden death within 1 h of the
onset  of  symptoms  in  women  with  no  other  plausible  cause  of
death  (other  than  coronary  disease);  these  cases  constituted
<12.3% of fatal CHD cases.

Data analysis

Person-years (the number of persons studied times the num-
ber of years of follow-up) for each participant were calculated
from the date of return of the 1980 questionnaire to the date of
the  first  CHD  event, death, or  1  June  1994, whichever  came
first. Women  were  divided  into  quintiles  according  to  the  per-
centage of energy from each type of saturated fatty acid. Inci-
dence rates were calculated by dividing the number of events by
person-years  of  follow-up  in  each  quintile.  The  relative  risk
(RR)  was  computed  as  the  rate  in  a  specific  category  of  fat
intake divided by that in the lowest quintile, with adjustment by
5-y age categories. In multivariate models using pooled logistic
regression  (16), we  simultaneously  included  intakes  of  total
energy, dietary  cholesterol, protein, and  fiber, and  percentages
of energy from saturated fat, monounsaturated fat, polyunsatu-
rated fat, and trans fat, in addition to other potential confound-
ing variables. In such models, the coefficient for a specific type
of fat can be interpreted as an estimate of the effect of that fat
compared  with  the  same  energy  from  carbohydrates  (17).  For
analyses of food consumption in relation to the risk of CHD, we
calculated composite scores for red meat, poultry and fish, low-
fat  dairy  products, and  high-fat  dairy  products  and  classified
women  into  quintiles  of  these  scores;  median  values  for  each
quintile were used to test for a linear trend.

Because intakes of individual saturated fatty acids were highly
correlated because of shared food sources, we did not enter all the
specific  saturated  fatty  acids  into  the  model  simultaneously.  To
distinguish 18:0 from other long-chain saturates, we entered the
intake of 18:0 and the sum of 12:0, 14:0, and 16:0 into the model
simultaneously. Because of a high correlation between 18:0 and
16:0 as a result of shared food sources, we also calculated 18:0
intakes, adjusted for 16:0 and other saturates, using the regression
method that has been described for energy adjustment (17). We
then conducted analyses using adjusted 18:0 intakes.

To  reduce  within-subject  variation  and  best  represent  long-
term  dietary  intakes, we  used  repeated  measures  of  diet  in  the
analyses (9). In particular, the incidence of CHD was related to
the  cumulative  average  of  individual  saturated  fatty  acids  from
all available questionnaires up to the start of each 2-y follow-up
interval in a pooled logistic model. Because changes in diet after
the  development  of  intermediate  endpoints  such  as  angina,
hypercholesterolemia, and  diabetes  may  confound  the  diet-dis-
ease associations (18), we stopped updating the diet at the begin-
ning  of  the  time  interval  during  which  individuals  developed
those  intermediate  endpoints.  Most  covariates  were  updated
biennially, including age (5-y category), time period (7 periods),
body mass index (5 categories), cigarette smoking (never, past,
and  current  smoking  of  1–14, 15–24, and  ‡ 25  cigarettes/d),
menopausal  status  (premenopausal, postmenopausal  without
hormone  replacement, postmenopausal  with  past  hormone

sumption  (0, 0–4, 5–14, and  ‡ 15  g/d).  Aspirin  use  (none,
1–6/wk, ‡ 7/wk, and dose unknown) was assessed in 1980, 1982,
1984, and  1988  and  regular  vigorous  exercise  was  assessed  in
1980.

RESULTS

Individual  saturated  fatty  acid  intakes, except  for  12:0,
declined  over  time  in  this  cohort  (Table  1).  At  baseline, 16:0
accounted for <55% of total saturated fatty acid intakes and 18:0
accounted for <16%. The primary contributors to 16:0 and 18:0
intakes in our cohort included beef as a main dish, cheese, beef as
a sandwich or mixed dish, and hamburgers (Table 2). Other satu-
rated fatty acids, including short- to medium-chain saturated fatty
acids (4:0–10:0), 12:0, and 14:0 were primarily from dairy prod-
ucts. Because of shared food sources, the correlations among spe-
cific  saturated  fatty  acids  were  high  (Table  3).  From  1980  to
1994, the average intake of beef as a main dish decreased from
51.12 to 22.72 g/d (1.8 to 0.8 oz/d), the average intake of butter
decreased  from  2.45  to  1.05  g/d  (0.49  to  0.21  pats/d), and  the
average intake of whole milk decreased from 63.44 to 17.08 g/d
(0.26 to 0.07 glasses/d).

Women  with  high  saturated  fat  intakes  were  more  likely  to
smoke, less likely to exercise, and less likely to take multivita-
min  and  vitamin  E  supplements  (Table 4).  Saturated  fat  intake
was positively correlated with intakes of other fatty acids, espe-
cially monounsaturated fat and dietary cholesterol, and inversely
correlated with intakes of alcohol and fiber.

RRs of CHD according to quintiles of individual saturated fatty
acid intakes are shown in Table 5. Because of very low intakes of

12:0 and high correlations between 12:0 and 14:0, we combined
the data for 12:0 and 14:0 in the analysis. There was no signiﬁcant
association between intakes of short- and medium-chain saturated
fatty  acids  (4:0–10:0)  in  age-adjusted  or  multivariate  analyses.
After adjustment for age, there were trends toward a higher risk
with higher intakes of 12:0 plus 14:0, 16:0, and 18:0. However, the
associations  were  substantially  attenuated  after  adjustment  for
smoking  and  other  nondietary  covariates.  Adjustment  for  other
dietary variables further attenuated these RRs.

RRs  of  CHD  from  analyses  in  which  saturated  fatty  acids
were treated as continuous variables are shown in Table 6. In the
multivariate  analyses  with  adjustment  for  both  nondietary  and
dietary  variables, the  RRs  for  a  1%  increase  in  energy  intake
were  0.97  (95%  CI: 0.90, 1.05)  for  4:0–10:0  and  1.12  (0.97,

SATURATED FATS AND CORONARY HEART DISEASE

1005

TABLE 6
Relative risks (RR) and 95% CIs of coronary heart disease for intakes of
individual saturated fatty acids and the ratio of polyunsaturated to
saturated fats (P:S) modeled as continuous variables

to 0.72 from the lowest to the highest deciles) were 1.0 (refer-
ence), 0.92, 0.90, 0.87, 0.94, 0.81, 0.68, 0.72, 0.58, and  0.58
(0.41, 0.83).

Using the multivariate model including the sum of 12:0–18:0
in  Table  6  after  adjustment  for  dietary  variables, we  estimated
the effects of isoenergetic replacement of saturated fats with car-
bohydrates or unsaturated fats on the risk of CHD. Replacement
of  5%  of  energy  from  the  sum  of  12:0–18:0  fatty  acids  with
energy  from  carbohydrate  would  reduce  the  risk  by  22%
(0–40%);  replacement  of  5%  of  energy  from  monounsaturated
and  polyunsaturated  fatty  acids  with  energy  from  carbohydrate
would  reduce  the  risk  by  42%  (6–65%)  and  50%  (30–64%),
respectively.

Because  beef  and  dairy  products  were  the  main  sources  of
saturated  fatty  acids, we  examined  the  associations  between
intakes of red meat (beef, pork, or lamb as a main dish; beef as
a sandwich or mixed dish; hamburger; hot dog; processed meat;
and  bacon)  and  high-fat  dairy  products  (whole  milk, hard  or
cream cheese, ice cream, and butter) and the risk of CHD (Table 7).
For  the  purpose  of  comparison, we  also  analyzed  the  associa-
tions between intakes of poultry and fish and low-fat dairy prod-
ucts (skim or low-fat milk, yogurt, and cottage cheese) and the
risk of CHD. After adjustment for age, consumption of red meat
and  high-fat  dairy  products  was  associated  with  an  increased
risk of CHD, whereas consumption of poultry and fish and low-
fat dairy products was associated with a lower risk. These asso-
ciations  were  substantially  attenuated  in  multivariate  analyses
and became nonsignificant, but the direction of the associations
remained unchanged. The ratio of red meat to poultry and fish
consumption was more strongly associated with the risk. Simi-
larly, the ratio of high-fat to low-fat diary product consumption
was  positively  associated  with  the  risk  of  CHD.  Among  the
dairy products, whole-milk consumption was associated with a
significantly  increased  risk  of  CHD.  The  multivariate  RRs
across categories of intake of whole milk [almost never, < 244
g/wk  (1  glass/wk), 488–1464 g/wk (2–6 glasses/wk), 244 g/d (1
glass/d), and ‡ 488 g/d (2 glasses/d)] were 1.0, 1.20, 1.17, 1.48,
and  1.67  (1.14, 1.90;  P for  trend  <  0.0001).  In  contrast, a
greater  consumption  of  skim  milk  was  associated  with  a
nonsignificantly lower risk of CHD; corresponding RRs across
categories of intake were 1.0, 0.83, 0.77, 0.89, and 0.78 (0.63,
0.96; P for trend = 0.09).

DISCUSSION

To our knowledge, this is the first epidemiologic study that
examined the role of specific saturated fatty acids in relation
to  the  risk  of  CHD. We  found  that  a  higher  dietary  intake  of
long-chain  saturated  fatty  acids, including  12:0, 14:0, 16:0,
and  18:0, was  associated  with  an  increased  risk  of  CHD,
whereas intake of short- to medium-chain saturated fatty acids
(4:0–10:0) was not. Higher consumption of red meat and high-
fat dairy products, the main sources of saturated fatty acids in
the  diet, was  also  associated  with  greater  risk.  In  contrast,
higher consumption of poultry and fish and low-fat dairy prod-
ucts was associated with a lower risk.

Because all individual long-chain saturated fatty acids (12:0,
14:0, 16:0, and  18:0)  were  associated  with  a  small  increase  in
risk, collectively, these fatty acids were associated with a modest
increased risk, an effect that was distinct from that of the short-
to medium-chain fatty acids. We did not find evidence that the

fatty acids (12:0–18:0) were summed, the RR for a 5% increase
in energy intake was 1.29 (1.00, 1.66) (P = 0.05).

To distinguish the effects of 18:0 intakes from intakes of other
saturated fatty acids, despite the high correlations, we computed
residuals for 18:0 by regressing 18:0 intakes on intakes of 16:0,
the sum of 12:0 and 14:0, and short- to medium-chain saturates.
The variation in 18:0 intake, independent of other saturated fatty
acids, represented  by  this  residual  was  0.4%  of  energy  for  the
10th–90th percentiles. The RR for a 1% increase in energy intake
from the 18:0 residuals was 1.22 (0.98, 1.54).

We  also  examined  the  association  between  the  ratio  of
polyunsaturated fat (which itself was strongly inversely related
to risk) to saturated fat (ie, the sum of 12:0–18:0) and the risk
of  CHD  (Table  5).  After  adjustment  for  age, smoking, other
nondietary variables, and intakes of monounsaturated fat, trans
fat, protein, and total energy, a higher ratio was associated with
a  significantly  lower  risk  of  CHD  (RR: 0.79;  0.70, 0.89)  for
each 0.2-unit increment in the ratio. When the ratio was treated

FIGURE 1. Multivariate relative risks of coronary heart disease according to deciles of the ratio of polyunsaturated to saturated fat (12:0–18:0)
(P:S). Median values across the deciles were 0.23, 0.29, 0.34, 0.38, 0.42, 0.45, 0.49, 0.54, 0.60, and 0.72. Values were adjusted for age (5-y category),
time period (7 periods), body mass index (5 categories), cigarette smoking (never, past, and current smoking of 1–14, 15–24, and ‡ 25 cigarettes/d),
menopausal  status  (premenopausal, postmenopausal  without  hormone  replacement, postmenopausal  with  past  hormone  replacement, and  post-

relation  between  18:0  and  risk  of  CHD  was  weaker  than  the
associations of other saturated fats with CHD risk. However, our
ability to distinguish among the types of saturated fats was lim-
ited  by  their  high  intercorrelations  because  their  predominant
sources were the same foods. This not only creates a high degree
of  statistical  collinearity, but  also  suggests  that  distinguishing
among  specific  types  of  saturated  fat  may  not  be  of  practical
importance in dietary advice. Nevertheless, because of collinear-
ity, our study could not address the effect of the addition of sub-
stantial amounts of purified 18:0 to the diet.

Most metabolic studies have shown that medium-chain satu-
rated fatty acids with 8–10 carbons do not raise plasma choles-
terol concentrations (19), although a recent study suggested the
opposite  (20).  On  the  other  hand, 12:0, 14:0, and  16:0  do
increase  total, LDL-, and  HDL-cholesterol  concentrations  (7).
Yu et al (19) reviewed 15 metabolic studies and found that 14:0
was more hypercholesterolemic than were the other fatty acids.
More  recent  studies, however, showed  no  increase  in  total  or
LDL cholesterol when 14:0 was substituted for 16:0 (21), but did
show an increase in HDL cholesterol when 14:0 was substituted
for 16:0 or 18:1 (22).

Although 18:0 has little effect on total and LDL-cholesterol
concentrations  compared  with  carbohydrate,
it  may  lower
HDL  cholesterol  compared  with  monounsaturated  or  polyun-
saturated fatty acids, and the HDL-lowering effect of 18:0 was
particularly strong among women (19). Aro et al (6) reported
recently  that  compared  with  a  diet  rich  in  dairy  fat  (rich  in
14:0  and  16:0), 18:0  reduced  LDL  concentrations  but  also
reduced HDL concentrations. Thus, the ratios of LDL to HDL
and  of  apolipoprotein  B  to  apolipoprotein  A-I  were  not
affected  significantly.  In  addition, 18:0  increased  Lp(a)  con-
centrations (6) and may activate factor VII (23) and impair fib-
rinolysis  (24).  Overall, evidence  from  recent  metabolic  stud-

ies, similar  to  our  data, does  not  appear  to  support  making  a
distinction between 18:0 and other saturated fatty acids when
giving dietary advice for reducing CHD risk. In addition to the
well-known effects on CHD risk of LDL cholesterol, the over-
all adverse effects of long-chain saturated fatty acids on CHD
risk observed in this study may be in part related to postpran-
dial responses to these fatty acids. Weintraub et al (25) found
that  postprandial  triacylglycerol  concentrations  were  highest
for  a  diet  rich  in  saturated  fat, lowest  for  a  diet  rich  in  n23
polyunsaturated  fat, and  intermediate  for  a  diet  rich  in  n26
polyunsaturated fat.

The observed relation between saturated fatty acid intake and
risk  of  CHD  was  much  weaker  than  that  predicted  by  interna-
tional comparisons (2). A major problem with the international
comparisons  was  serious  confounding  by  lifestyle  variables
such  as  physical  activity  and  obesity  and  other  aspects  of  diet
such  as  fiber  intake.  Our  results  are  consistent  with  the  possi-
bility that the proportional increase in plasma HDL-cholesterol
concentration produced by saturated fatty acids somewhat com-
pensates  for  its  adverse  effect  on  LDL-cholesterol  concentra-
tions. Finally, we found a strong inverse association between the
ratio  of  polyunsaturated  to  saturated  fat  and  the  risk  of  CHD.
This result is consistent with findings from dietary intervention
trials in which substitution of polyunsaturated for saturated fat
without a reduction in the total fat content of the diet substan-
tially reduced the risk of CHD (26, 27).

In conclusion, a distinction between 18:0 and other saturated
fats in dietary advice to reduce CHD risk does not appear to be
important, in part because of the high correlation between 18:0
and other saturated fats in typical diets. However, these data do
suggest  that  replacement  of  long-chain  saturated  fat  with
polyunsaturated fat is likely to reduce substantially the risk of
CHD.  Our  results  also  support  recommendations  to  substitute

Increased consumption of fruit and

of coronary heart disease: meta-analysis
of cohort studies

Increased consumption of fruit and vegetables has been
shown to be associated with a reduced risk of coronary
heart disease (CHD) in many epidemiological studies,
however, the extent of the association is uncertain. We
quantitatively assessed the relation between fruit and
vegetable intake and incidence of CHD by carrying out a
meta-analysis of cohort studies. Studies were included
if they reported relative risks (RRs) and corresponding
95% confidence interval (CI) of CHD with respect to
frequency of fruit and vegetable intake. Twelve studies,
consisting of 13 independent cohorts, met the inclusion
criteria. There were 278 459 individuals (9143 CHD
events) with a median follow-up of 11 years. Compared
with individuals who had less than 3 servings/day of
fruit and vegetables, the pooled RR of CHD was 0.93

(95% CI: 0.86–1.00, P¼ 0.06) for those with 3–5 servings/
day and 0.83 (0.77–0.89, Po0.0001) for those with more
than 5 servings/day. Subgroup analyses showed that
both fruits and vegetables had a significant protective
effect on CHD. Our meta-analysis of prospective cohort
studies demonstrates that increased consumption of
fruit and vegetables from less than 3 to more than 5
servings/day is related to a 17% reduction in CHD risk,
whereas increased intake to 3–5 servings/day is asso-
ciated with a smaller and borderline significant reduc-
tion in CHD risk. These results provide strong support
for the recommendations to consume more than 5
servings/day of fruit and vegetables.

Introduction

Although coronary heart disease (CHD) mortality
has been falling during the past 30 years, it is still
the commonest cause of death in most developed
countries. For instance, in the United Kingdom,
CHD accounts for about 114 000 deaths a year, and
approximately 1.3 million people have had a heart
attack and around 2 million people are suffering
from angina. CHD costs the UK economy about d7.9
billion a year.1 Primary prevention of CHD is
therefore a major public health priority. An increase
in the consumption of fruit and vegetables has been
advocated for the prevention of CHD, stroke and
some cancers.2–4 However, there is still considerable
uncertainty about the relation between fruit and
vegetable intake and CHD. Several systematic re-

views of observational studies have been pub-
lished.5–7 Ness and Powles5 reviewed the evidence
of ecological, case-control and cohort studies and
showed that 6 of 16 cohort studies, 9 of 10 ecological
and 2 of 3 case-control studies reported a protective
effect of fruit and vegetables or surrogate nutrients of
fruit and vegetables on CHD. Owing to the variations
between individual studies in the measures of
exposure and outcome, no attempt was made to
quantify the association between fruit and vegetable
intake and CHD risk. Law and Morris6 carried out a
meta-analysis of cohort studies in an attempt to
quantify the relationship between fruit and vegeta-
ble consumption and CHD. Six markers were used
as an index of fruit and vegetable intake (fruit,
vegetables, carotenoids, vitamin C, fruit fibre and
vegetable fibre). The analysis showed that the risk of
CHD is about 15% lower at the ninetieth than at the
tenth centile of fruit and vegetable consumption. In
another review, Van’t Veer et al.7 estimated that
an increase of 150 g/day of fruit and vegetables
was associated with a 30% reduction in CHD risk
(based on best guess), ranging from 20 (conservative

estimate) to 40% (optimistic estimate). However, the
validity of these estimates is questionable.

foods rather

Both the review by Ness and Powles5 and the
meta-analysis by Law and Morris6 included only a
very small number of studies that reported fruit and
vegetable intake, and other included studies looked
at some selected nutrients, for example vitamin C,
potassium, carotenoids, fruit fibre and vegetable
fibre, rather than fruit and vegetables themselves.
Nutritional advice is often easier to understand in
the context of
than the nutrients
contained within them. Therefore, linking foods or
food groups to outcomes may be especially impor-
tant. Additionally, in all of the three reviews,5–7 only
studies published before 1998 were included (that
is, literature search date was up to 1998). Since then,
there have been a number of cohort studies
published that looked at the relationship between
fruit and vegetable intake and CHD.8–15 We therefore
carried out a meta-analysis of prospective cohort
studies to quantitatively assess the relation between
fruit and vegetable intake and the risk of CHD.

Materials and methods

Literature search
We developed a search strategy (Table 1) to search
for studies that reported the association between
fruit and vegetable intake and CHD. We searched
electronic database – MEDLINE (1966 to November
2005) and EMBASE (1980 to November 2005). We
also searched the Cochrane Library with terms of
‘fruit’ or ‘vegetables’ in all fields. Furthermore, we
reviewed reference list of original and review
articles to search for more studies. Only studies that
were published as full article and in English were
considered.

Inclusion/exclusion criteria
For inclusion, studies had to fulfil the following
criteria:

(1) have prospective cohort design;
(2) report relative risks (RRs) or hazard ratios (HRs)
and their corresponding 95% confidence inter-
vals (CIs) of CHD in relation to each category of
fruit and vegetable intake;

(3) provide frequency or amount of

fruit and
vegetable consumption, which allowed for stan-
dardized classification of
fruit and vegetable
intake.

Studies were excluded if

(1) case-control design was used;
(2) mixed healthy diet was reported, where the
fruit and vegetables could not be

separated;

(3) only surrogate nutrients of fruits or vegetables
were reported, whereas fruits or vegetables
themselves were not reported;

(4) only two categories of fruit and vegetable intake
(for example daily vs never) were reported,
which could not allow for adequate categoriza-
tion of fruit and vegetable intake.

When multiple publications from the same study
cohort were available, we included only the one
with the most detailed information for both outcome
and fruit and vegetable consumption and with the
longest duration of follow-up.

Data extraction
Data were extracted independently by three persons
(FJ He, CA Nowson and M Lucas) and differences
were resolved by discussion with a fourth reviewer
(GA MacGregor). Relevant data recorded were the
first author’s name, year of publication, country of
origin of centres, number of participants, partici-
pants’ age, duration of follow-up, number of events,
methods of measuring fruit and vegetable consump-
tion, frequency or amount of fruit and vegetable
intake for each group, outcome assessment, RRs or
HRs and the corresponding 95% CIs of CHD for each
group of fruit and vegetable intake, and covariates
adjusted in the statistical analysis.

Standardization of fruit and vegetable categories
As the studies included in this meta-analysis
reported fruit and vegetable consumption using
different measurement units (for example, grams/
day, servings/day, times/day, tertile, quartile, quin-
tile), and serving sizes also varied between studies,
we therefore standardized and grouped fruit and
vegetable consumption into three categories: o3

719

servings/day, 3–5 servings/day and 45 servings/day
for each study (equivalent to o235 g/day, 235–391
g/day, 4391 g/day for fruit and vegetables com-
bined). This was performed by an experienced
nutritionist (CA Nowson) with assistance from M
Lucas. We estimated the average weight of a range of
commonly consumed fruit and vegetables using
serving size weights for a 0.5 cup standard serving,
as indicated in the Composition of Foods Raw,
Processed, Prepared, USDA Nutrient Database for
Standard Reference, Release 18.16 From this data-
base, the average serving was calculated as 80 g for
fruits and 77 g for vegetables.

When we performed subgroup analysis for fruits
and vegetables separately or when an individual
study reported fruits alone or vegetables alone, the
equivalent intake for the three standardized cate-
gories was arbitrarily defined as o1.3, 1.3–2.0 and
42.0 servings/day, respectively for fruits, and o1.7,
1.7–3.0 and 43.0 servings/day, respectively for
vegetables.

We assigned each standardized category of fruit
and vegetable intake based on the median or mean
intake reported in individual studies. When median
or mean intake was not reported, and only range of
fruit and vegetable intake was reported, we used the
mean of upper and lower bounds of that group.
When an upper bound was not reported for the
group with the highest fruit and vegetable intake in
individual studies, this group was assigned to the
top category in our meta-analysis. One included
study17
reported occasions of eating fruit and
vegetables, where serving size was not specified,
we assumed ‘1–2 times/day’ of 3–5 servings of fruit
and vegetables combined.

If

Statistical analyses
RR or HR was used as a measure of the relation
between fruit and vegetable intake and CHD. RRs
and HRs in each study were transformed by taking
their natural logarithms (ln), and the standard errors
(s.e.) were calculated from ln RRs or ln HRs and
their corresponding 95% CIs. We allocated RRs
reported in individual studies into the standardized
categories in the meta-analysis.
the average
consumption of fruit and vegetables from more than
one group in a single study fell into the same
category of fruit and vegetable intake in our meta-
analysis, then we pooled these RRs with inverse
variance weight and used the combined RR for that
category.18 The reference category (that is RR¼ 1) in
individual studies cannot be split into groups, nor
combined with other groups, except that the authors
have kindly re-analysed their data according to our
request. Because of this, misclassification may have
occurred in six cohorts. In two cohorts,12,19 the
average fruit and vegetable intake in the reference
group was slightly higher than the cut-off point for
the reference category in our meta-analysis, and in
four other cohorts,9,11,13,14 the group (or groups) next

to the reference group should be combined with the
reference group. In the latter circumstances, these
groups could be either left out or placed under our
standardized category 2. We chose the latter option.
However, a separate analysis was performed by
excluding all of the cohorts where misclassification
was likely to have occurred.

Among the 13 cohorts included in our study, 2
reported non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI) and
CHD death separately.9,20 In one study,9 only first
event was registered as endpoint. We therefore
combined RRs of non-fatal MI and CHD death with
inverse variance weight and used the combined RRs
for our main analysis. In the other study,20 a few
participants had both non-fatal MI and subsequently
fatal CHD event, and both events were counted as
endpoints. We therefore included RRs of CHD death
in the main analysis and RRs of MI in a separate
analysis for MI in our meta-analysis.

By comparison with the lowest category of fruit
and vegetable intake, we estimated the pooled RRs
and 95% CIs of CHD for the middle and the highest
categories by using random-effects model because of
the presence of significant heterogeneity (that is
Po0.1). Heterogeneity was analysed using the I2 and
Q statistics. I2 describes the per cent variation across
studies that is a result of heterogeneity rather than
chance.21 We used funnel plot asymmetry to detect
whether there was publication bias in the meta-
analysis and Egger’s regression test
to measure
funnel plot asymmetry.22,23 Statistical analyses were
performed using Cochrane Collaboration Review
Manager 4.2 software and the Statistical Package
for the Social Sciences.

Results

Figure 1 shows the number of studies assessed and
excluded through the stages of the meta-analysis. A
total of 12 studies comprising 13 independent
cohorts8-15,17,19,20,24 were found that fitted in the
inclusion criteria (one study10 consisted of
two
separate cohorts, that is, the Health Professionals’
Follow-up Study and the Nurses’ Health Study, and
they were entered as two independent cohorts).
Table 2 summarizes the characteristics of included
studies. Among the 13 cohorts included in the meta-
analysis, 9 were from the United States and 4 from
Europe. The studies combined had a total of 278 459
individuals with 9143 CHD events. The median
duration of follow-up was 11 years, ranging from 5
to 26 years.

The RRs of CHD and the corresponding 95% CIs

vegetables, the pooled RR of CHD was 0.93 (95% CI:
0.86–1.00, P¼ 0.06) for those with 3–5 servings/day
and 0.83 (0.77–0.89, Po0.0001) for those with more
than 5 servings/day (Figure 2).

The subgroup analyses according to gender,
duration of follow-up, dietary assessment method
and dietary instrument administration are shown in
Table 3. Compared with those who had fruit and
vegetable intake of less than 3 servings/day, indivi-
duals with fruit and vegetable intake of more than 5
servings/day had a significantly lower risk of CHD
irrespective of participants’ gender, duration of
follow-up and method of dietary assessment. How-
ever, the association between fruit and vegetable
intake and CHD was not significant in studies where
dietary assessment was completed via interview. For
individuals with fruit and vegetable intake of 3–5
servings/day, the association was only significant in
some subgroups (Table 3).

Among the 13 cohorts included in the meta-
analysis, 9 reported the association for fruits and
separately.8-11,14,17,20,24 The equivalent
vegetables
intake for the three categories standardized in our
meta-analysis was o1.3, 1.3–2.0 and 42.0 servings/
day for fruits and o1.7, 1.7–3.0 and 43.0 servings/
day for vegetables. The pooled analysis showed that
both fruits and vegetables had a significant protec-
tive effect against CHD (Table 3).

Four studies reported the association between
fruit and vegetable intake and MI (106 192 indivi-

Journal of Human Hypertension

duals with 1769 events).8,9,11,20 Compared with
individuals who had less than 3 servings/day of
fruit and vegetables, the pooled RR of MI was 0.94
(95% CI: 0.80–1.10, P¼ 0.43) for those with 3–5
servings/day and 0.83 (0.70–0.99, P¼ 0.04) for those
with more than 5 servings/day.

We performed a separate analysis by excluding
the studies,9,11–14,19 in which misclassification was
likely to have occurred, and the study17 where the
classification of fruit and vegetable intake was based
on assumption due to lack of details reported. A
total of 6 cohorts with 197 633 individuals (3323
events) were included in this analysis. The results
showed that, compared with individuals who had
less than 3 servings/day of fruit and vegetables, the
pooled RR of CHD was 0.88 (95% CI: 0.75–1.02,
P¼ 0.09) for those with 3–5 servings/day and 0.82
(0.74–0.91, P¼ 0.0002) for those with more than 5
servings/day.

Heterogeneity
In our meta-analysis,
there was a significant
between-study heterogeneity (Table 3). Stratified
analysis by gender, duration of follow-up, dietary
assessment method and dietary instrument admin-
istration did not reduce the heterogeneity consis-
tently. However, the stratified analysis for fruits and
vegetables separately, reduced the heterogeneity
considerably for most subgroups except for the top
category of vegetable intake where significant
heterogeneity still existed (Table 3).

Publication bias
We plotted ln RR against the s.e. of ln RR (Figure 3).
The funnel plot was slightly asymmetrical, suggest-
ing a possible small publication bias (that is, smaller
studies showing no association might be under-
reported in the literature). Egger’s regression test
suggested no significant asymmetry of the funnel
plot (P¼ 0.222 and 0.412 for the middle and highest
category of fruit and vegetable intake, respectively).
This would indicate that there was no substantial
publication bias.

Discussion

Our meta-analysis has quantitatively assessed the
relation between fruit and vegetable intake and CHD
risk. The study is robust in that the prospective
design should eliminate selection bias and recall
bias. Furthermore, most studies included in our
meta-analysis had a large sample size and long
duration of follow-up. Meta-analysis of these studies
is a potentially powerful approach to assess the
long-term effects of fruit and vegetable intake on
CHD risk. Our study shows that an increased
consumption of fruit and vegetables is related to a
reduced risk of CHD. Compared with those who
have less than 3 servings of fruit and vegetables per

day, individuals with more than 5 servings/day have
an approximately 17% reduction in CHD risk,
whereas individuals with 3–5 servings/day have a
smaller and borderline significant reduction in CHD
risk (7% reduction). These results provide strong
support for the recommendations to consume more
than 5 servings/day of fruit and vegetables.

The results of our meta-analysis are in agreement
with those from the previous studies.6,7,25 Law and
Morris6 studied the association of CHD with six
dietary markers of fruit and vegetable intake in
cohort studies and found that, on average, the risk of
CHD is about 15% lower at the 90th than at the 10th
centile of fruit and vegetable consumption judged

from six dietary markers. However, detailed analysis
showed that the association was only significant for
carotenoids, vitamin C, fruit fibre and vegetable
fibre, whereas there was no significant association of
fruits or vegetables with CHD, although the RRs
were of similar magnitude for all six dietary
markers. These non-significant findings for fruits
or vegetables are likely to be due to the small
number of studies included (that is, only three
studies for fruits and two for vegetables). Another
meta-analysis of cohort studies by Van’t Veer et al.
estimated that an increase of 150 g/day of fruit and
vegetables was associated with a reduction of 20 to
40% in CHD risk. Lock et al.25 estimated that,
worldwide, up to 2.6 million deaths per year were
attributable to inadequate consumption of fruit and
vegetables, and increasing fruit and vegetable con-
sumption to 600 g/day could reduce the burden of
CHD by 31%. A recent meta-analysis of six cohort
studies showed that the risk of CHD was decreased
by 4% for each additional portion/day of fruit and
vegetable intake.26 Pereira et al.27 pooled the original
data of 10 cohort studies and showed that the
consumption of dietary fibre from fruit and cereals
was inversely associated with CHD risk, but there
was no significant association between vegetable
fibre and CHD risk. Pereira et al. speculated that the
beneficial effects of vegetable fibre may be countered
by the high glycemic load from starchy and heavily
processed vegetables. However, in their analysis,
Pereira et al. did not look at whether there was an

recall bias and bias due to the changes in diet and
lifestyle following CHD events. However, one large,
international, standardized case-control study (that
is, the INTERHEART) is worth mentioning. The
INTERHEART study28 enrolled 15 152 cases of acute
MI and 14 820 controls from 262 centres in 52
countries. Only first acute MI cases were included
in order to minimize the bias due to changes in diet
and lifestyle following CHD events. The results
showed that
and
vegetables every day compared with those who
did not, had a reduction of 30% (95% CI: 21 to
38%)
(adjusted for possible
confounding factors). Several other case-control
studies29–31 generally observed a stronger associa-
tion between fruit and vegetable intake and CHD
than we found in our meta-analysis of prospective
cohort studies.

individuals who ate

fruit

in the risk of MI

Although there is no outcome of evidence from
long-term randomized trials looking at fruit and
vegetables alone on the primary prevention of
CHD, randomized trials in individuals who had
survived CHD showed that
increasing fruit and
vegetable intake in combination with other diet and
lifestyle changes significantly reduced the recurrence
of CHD events.32,33 These results lend further support
fruit and vegetables in
to the important role of
CHD prevention,
though the beneficial effects
are not solely attributable to fruit and vegetable
consumption.

A substantial heterogeneity across studies was
apparent in our meta-analysis. The heterogeneity
was not accounted by gender, duration of follow-up
or the approach used to measure fruit and vegetable
intake. However, the stratified analysis for fruits and
vegetables separately reduced the heterogeneity. It is
possible that variation between study populations
on what types of fruits and vegetables and whether
cooked or
raw vegetables are most commonly
consumed may introduce heterogeneity. It is specu-
lated that there will be a stronger association with
those vegetables that contain more protective nu-
trients,
for example, potassium, and a weaker
association with heavily processed vegetables. Some
of the cohort studies included potatoes as vegeta-
bles, some excluded potatoes from vegetables, others
did not report whether potatoes were included or
not. This may also introduce heterogeneity. How-
ever, due to the limited information reported in the
literature, we did not perform further analyses on
this issue.

Our study may have a number of potential
limitations. First, we could not exclude potential
biases due to other dietary and lifestyle factors.
Individuals who eat more fruit and vegetables are
likely to have lower rates of smoking, a lower intake
of salt and saturated fat, higher levels of physical

in the included studies. However,

exercise and are less likely to be overweight.12 Such
healthier diet and lifestyles have been shown to
reduce the risk of CHD. A meta-analysis is not able
to solve problems with confounding that may be
inherent
the
adjustment of major confounding factors in the
included studies should reduce the potential bias
due to these other dietary and lifestyle factors.
Second, we could not exclude the potential bias due
to measurement error in the dietary assessment.
Among the 12 studies included in our meta-
analysis, only 3 took account of the changes of
dietary intake over time, and in the majority of the
studies dietary assessment was only made at base-
line. The inherent measurement error in the dietary
assessment would tend to attenuate the protective
effect of fruit and vegetables. Therefore, the reduc-
tions in CHD risk observed in our study may be a
conservative estimate. Finally, we could not exclude
potential biases due to misclassification of fruit and
vegetable intake as dietary assessment method, the
number of groups of fruit and vegetable consump-
tion, and the reference category varied among
individual studies. However, our subgroup analyses
did not support the presence of major confounding
effects by these factors.

The protective effects of fruit and vegetables on
CHD have a strong biological basis. Fruit and
vegetables are rich sources of potassium, folate,
fibre, antioxidants and bioactive phytochemicals.
Randomized trials have shown that increasing fruit
and vegetable consumption with a subsequent
increase
in 24 h urinary potassium excretion
lowers blood pressure,34 and potassium supplemen-
tation trials also show a significant and similar
blood pressure-lowering effect as fruit and vegeta-
bles.35–37 As raised blood pressure throughout its
range is a major cause of CHD, it is likely that
the blood pressure-lowering effect of potassium is
the major mechanism that contributes to a reduced
risk of CHD with higher
fruit and vegetable
consumption.

Dietary folate is a determinant of plasma homo-
cysteine level, and there have been several studies
relating plasma homocysteine levels with the risk of
CHD.38,39 Dietary fibre may contribute to the reduc-
tion in CHD risk by lowering blood pressure and
cholesterol.40 Phytochemicals (plant sterols, flavo-
noids and sulphur-containing compounds) found in
fruits and vegetables may be important in reducing
risk of atherosclerosis.41 Antioxidants have been
shown, in experimental models, to reduce athero-
sclerosis, mainly through a reduction of the amount
of oxidized low-density lipoprotein available to be
incorporated into lesions.
Increasing fruit and
vegetable consumption causes a rise in plasma
antioxidants in randomized trials.42 However, long-
term intervention studies of folate, vitamins B, C and
E and b-carotene have failed to show any beneficial
effect on CHD.43,44 Therefore, the contributions of
folate, fibre, antioxidants and phytochemicals to a

reduced risk of CHD with a higher fruit and vegetable
intake are speculative.

for

In conclusion, our meta-analysis of prospective
cohort studies demonstrates that
increased con-
sumption of fruit and vegetables from less than 3
to more than 5 servings/day is related to a 17%
reduction in CHD risk, whereas increased intake to
3–5 servings/day is associated with a smaller and
borderline significant reduction in CHD risk. The
average fruit and vegetable intake in most developed
countries is approximately 3 servings/day, and it is
even less in developing countries. The current
recommendations are to increase the intake to 5 or
more servings/day. Our results provide strong sup-
port
these were
achieved, there would be a large reduction in CHD
morbidity and mortality. As raised blood pressure
throughout its range is a major cause of CHD, it is
likely that the blood pressure-lowering effect of fruit
and vegetables is the major mechanism that con-
tributes to a reduced risk of CHD. In addition to its
effect on CHD, an increase in the consumption of
fruit and vegetables may reduce the risk of strokes45
and some cancers46 and may have other health
benefits, for example improving bowel function,47

through improved satiety,48 however,

ABSTRACT

Objective To investigate the association between
treatment induced change in high density lipoprotein
cholesterol and total death, coronary heart disease death,
and coronary heart disease events (coronary heart disease
death and non-fatal myocardial infarction) adjusted for
changes in low density lipoprotein cholesterol and drug
class in randomised trials of lipid modifying interventions.
Design Systematic review and meta-regression analysis of
randomised controlled trials.
Data sources Medline, Embase, Central, CINAHL, and
AMED to October 2006 supplemented by contact with
experts in the field.
Study selection In teams of two, reviewers independently
determined eligibility of randomised trials that tested lipid
modifying interventions to reduce cardiovascular risk,
reported high density lipoprotein cholesterol and
mortality or myocardial infarctions separately for
treatment groups, and treated and followed participants
for at least six months.
Data extraction and synthesis Using standardised, pre-
piloted forms, reviewers independently extracted relevant
information from each article. The change in lipid
concentrations for each trial and the weighted risk ratios
for clinical outcomes were calculated.
Results The meta-regression analysis included 108
randomised trials involving 299 310 participants at risk of
cardiovascular events. All analyses that adjusted for
changes in low density lipoprotein cholesterol showed no
association between treatment induced change in high
density lipoprotein cholesterol and risk ratios for coronary
heart disease deaths, coronary heart disease events, or
total deaths. With all trials included, change in high
density lipoprotein cholesterol explained almost no
variability (<1%) in any of the outcomes. The change in the
quotient of low density lipoprotein cholesterol and high

density lipoprotein cholesterol did not explain more of the
variability in any of the outcomes than did the change in
low density lipoprotein cholesterol alone. For a 10 mg/dl
(0.26 mmol/l) reduction in low density lipoprotein
cholesterol, the relative risk reduction was 7.2% (95%
confidence interval 3.1% to 11%; P=0.001) for coronary
heart disease deaths, 7.1% (4.5% to 9.8%; P<0.001) for
coronary heart disease events, and 4.4% (1.6% to 7.2%;
P=0.002) for total deaths, when adjusted for change in
high density lipoprotein cholesterol and drug class.
Conclusions Available data suggest that simply increasing
the amount of circulating high density lipoprotein
cholesterol does not reduce the risk of coronary heart
disease events, coronary heart disease deaths, or total
deaths. The results support reduction in low density
lipoprotein cholesterol as the primary goal for lipid
modifying interventions.

INTRODUCTION

Large cohort studies have identified high density
lipoprotein cholesterol as a strong,
independent,
inverse predictor of risk of coronary heart disease.1-4
Although the inverse relation seems not to apply to
particular subgroups of patients with genetic varia-
tions, such as ABCA1 or cholesteryl ester transfer
protein mutations leading to abnormal low or high
levels of high density lipoprotein cholesterol,5 6 the
National Cholesterol Education Program has recog-
nised high density lipoprotein cholesterol as an
independent cardiovascular risk factor and recom-
mended screening measurements of high density
lipoprotein cholesterol for all adults.7-9

The association between high density lipoprotein
cholesterol concentrations and coronary heart disease
in observational studies does not, however, establish
the extent to which changes in high density lipoprotein

cholesterol will alter the risk of coronary heart disease
events. Many large randomised trials and meta-
analyses led to the identification of
low density
lipoprotein cholesterol as the principal target for lipid
modifying interventions.8 9 Evidence that raising high
density lipoprotein cholesterol will reduce cardio-
vascular adverse outcomes remains controversial.

Clinical trials of the high density lipoprotein raising
agent niacin have shown a reduction in coronary
events, but these trials either did not measure change in
high density lipoprotein cholesterol or failed to include
analyses adjusted for changes in low density lipopro-
tein cholesterol.10-14 Sub-studies of two trials using the
fibrate gemfibrozil suggested that an increase in high
density lipoprotein cholesterol reduces the risk of
coronary heart disease.15 16 In the Veterans Affairs
High-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol Intervention
Trial (VA-HIT), a multivariable analysis adjusting for
several coronary heart disease risk factors and on-
treatment low density lipoprotein cholesterol and
triglycerides suggested an independent association of
increased high density lipoprotein cholesterol with
reduction in coronary heart disease death and non-fatal
myocardial infarction. However, the VA-HIT investi-
gators also found that on-treatment lipid concentra-
tions as variables in a multivariable model explained
only a small amount of
the beneficial effect of
gemfibrozil.15 New approaches to increase high density
lipoprotein cholesterol by the cholesteryl ester transfer
protein inhibitor torcetrapib or by infusion of recon-
stituted high density lipoprotein failed to show
beneficial effects.17-20 As part of a systematic review of
lipid trials published up to 2001, an analysis focusing on
19 statin trials failed to establish a statistically
significant association between changes in high density
lipoprotein cholesterol and relative risk reductions for
patient important outcomes.21

We used meta-regression techniques in an updated,
more comprehensive systematic review of randomised
trials to explore an independent link between changes
in high density lipoprotein cholesterol, not limited to
statins but covering all lipid modifying treatment, and
coronary heart disease related morbidity and mortal-
ity.

METHODS
Data sources and searches
We included studies if
they compared any lipid
modifying agent or diet with placebo or usual care or
compared a more intensive with a less intensive lipid
modifying treatment; targeted reduction in cardio-
vascular risk; had a randomised control design;
reported mortality or myocardial
infarctions sepa-
rately for treatment groups; and followed patients for at
least six months. We excluded studies that failed to
report either change from baseline or follow-up
concentrations of high density lipoprotein cholesterol
and low density lipoprotein cholesterol and studies for
which critics have raised serious questions about the
integrity of the data.22 23

Potentially relevant articles identified
and screened for retrieval (n=10 532)

Articles excluded on basis of title and

We built our search for relevant studies on the
sensitive search strategies used in previous systematic
reviews supplemented with relevant keywords and
medical subject headings.21 24-28 To update this evi-
dence, MB and NB (an experienced librarian) searched
Medline, Embase, and Central (all from January 2003
to October 2006) in addition to CINAHL and AMED
(both from their inception to October 2006). We used
Cochrane sensitive search strategies for identifying
randomised trials and made no restriction as to
language. The detailed search strategy is available
from the authors. We reviewed reference lists of
eligible articles, recently published editorials, and
reviews on the topic and consulted with experts.

Study selection and quality assessment
Investigators trained in research methods worked in
pairs and independently reviewed potentially eligible
titles and abstracts. If either reviewer believed that the
study might be eligible, we obtained the full report.
Two investigators then independently assessed the

ment of allocation; blinding of patients, caregivers, or
clinical outcome assessors; adherence to the intention
to treat principle; stopping early for benefit; and the
proportion of patients lost to follow-up.30

Data extraction and end points
Two investigators independently extracted all relevant
information on baseline characteristics of trials, patient
populations, interventions, and outcomes from each
eligible article by using standardised, pre-piloted data
extraction forms. We recorded all available baseline
and follow-up concentrations of total cholesterol, low
density lipoprotein cholesterol, high density lipopro-
tein cholesterol, and triglycerides. In five trials that
failed to report exact
lipid concentrations, we
abstracted data from graphs. Clinical end points were
total deaths, coronary heart disease deaths, and
coronary heart disease events (combined outcome of
non-fatal myocardial infarction and coronary heart
disease death). For coronary heart disease death, we
extracted data by using the following hierarchy:
coronary heart disease death, fatal myocardial infarc-
tion and sudden death, fatal myocardial infarction, fatal
cardiac events, fatal cardiovascular events.

Data synthesis and analysis
We report means and standard deviations of lipid
concentrations as milligrams per decilitre; we used the
method of Hozo to convert data reported as median
and range,31 and we followed the recommendations of
the Cochrane methods group for data reported as
median and 25th and 75th centiles.32 We calculated
change in lipid concentrations for each trial as the
difference between the mean change in the lipid
concentration from baseline to the average follow-up
concentrations in the intervention and control groups.
We pooled treatment effects across studies by calculat-
ing inverse variance weighted average risk ratios and
associated 95% confidence intervals for specified
outcomes by using a random effects model.

We used inverse variance weighted meta-regression
analysis to investigate the association between differ-
ences in the change in high density lipoprotein

cholesterol and low density lipoprotein cholesterol
concentrations between treatment and control groups
and the risk ratios of clinical outcomes of interest.33 34
To take into account non-lipid effects of specific drugs
(such as potential pro-thrombotic effects of hormone
therapy), we included a categorical variable of drug
class in the meta-regression model and did a meta-
regression analysis stratified by drug class. We used R2
to measure the proportion of the variability in the log
risk ratio of an outcome explained by the statistical
model. We analysed residuals to check model assump-
tions. To determine whether the potential relation
between treatment induced changes in high density
lipoprotein cholesterol and risk ratios for coronary
heart disease events varied across drug classes, we
tested for interactions between change in high density
lipoprotein cholesterol and different classes of inter-
ventions by means of an F test. We found little evidence
for interaction (P=0.73). That is, our analysis provided
no support for the hypothesis that increase in high
density lipoprotein cholesterol had a greater effect on
patient important outcomes with some drugs than with
others. Therefore, we omitted interaction terms to
simplify the final model. Analyses with percentage
change in lipid subfractions yielded similar results to
analyses with absolute change (mg/dl) and are there-
fore not reported.

In pre-specified sensitivity analyses, we focused on a
more homogeneous sample of trials that used inter-
ventions known to raise high density lipoprotein
cholesterol concentrations (rather than reducing trigly-
cerides) and therefore excluded trials using n-3 fatty
acids, low fat diets, or probucol, as well as trials focusing
on patients with renal failure. In addition, we excluded
trials with agents that are associated with harmful
effects such as torcetrapib or hormones. We did further
pre-specified sensitivity analyses excluding trials with
one year or less of follow-up and excluding trials with

two years or less of follow-up, as lipid effects may take
more than a year to fully translate into clinical
effects.35 36 In response to reviewers’ comments, we
added a sensitivity analysis focusing on trials with
interventions specifically chosen to raise high density
lipoprotein cholesterol (fibrates and niacin combina-
tions) and another focusing on trials that reported
intention to treat results. Finally, we investigated the
association of treatment induced change in triglycer-
ides concentrations with clinical outcomes by using the
same approach as for high density lipoprotein choles-
terol. We used SAS version 9.1 for analyses. We set the
threshold for statistical significance at P<0.05.

RESULTS

Of 158 eligible randomised controlled trials, 50 did not
report change or follow-up values for both high density
lipoprotein cholesterol and low density lipoprotein
cholesterol and were therefore excluded, leaving 108

trials for analysis (figure). Three of these 108 trials had
multiple treatment arms, so we used the control group
for comparison against all treatment arms. In total,
146 890 participants were included in the intervention
groups and 152 420 in the control groups. The web
appendix summarises the methodological quality
assessment of included trials and characteristics of
patient populations. On the basis of pharmacological
characteristics, we classified trials according to the
following classes of intervention 37: statins (54 trials
comparing statins with placebo or usual carew1-w54 and
trials comparing more intensive with less
eight
intensive statin treatmentw55-w62);
fibrates (nine
trialsw63-w71); resins (three trialsw72-w74); niacin combina-
tions with a statin, fibrate, or resin (six trialsA1;A75-A79); n-
3 fatty acids (nine trialsw80-w88); acyl-CoA:cholesterol
acyltransferase inhibitors (two trialsw92 w93); probucol
(two trialsw21 w94); glitazones (two trialsw95 w96); hor-
mones (nine trialsw97-w105); torcetrapib (two trialsw106
w107); low fat diets and surgery (five trialsw74 w89-w91 w108).
Agreement between reviewers for study eligibility was
very high (κ range 0.84-0.94).

Lipid modifying effects
Table 1 summarises the baseline concentrations and
changes in lipid subfractions for the different classes of
intervention. The average weighted mean baseline low
density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration of all
included participants was 140 (SD 23; range 84-279)
mg/dl (3.62 mmol/l), and the high density lipoprotein
cholesterol concentration was 47 (7.4; 32-62) mg/dl
(1.22 mmol/l). The weighted mean change in low
density lipoprotein cholesterol was −23 (SD 19) mg/dl
(−0.59 mmol/l), and the weighted mean change in high
density lipoprotein cholesterol was 1.7 (3.1) mg/dl
(0.04 mmol/l). Almost all classes of
intervention
reduced low density lipoprotein cholesterol except
for n-3 fatty acids and glitazones. High density
lipoprotein cholesterol was raised by most classes of
intervention except for n-3 fatty acids, low-fat diets,
acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase inhibitors, and
probucol. In addition, high dose statin treatment
(defined as 80 mg daily simvastatin or atorvastatin)
slightly reduced high density lipoprotein cholesterol
compared with less intensive statin treatment
(weighted mean change −0.23 (SD 0.83) mg/dl),w56-
w59 w61 w62 whereas statins overall raised it moderately
(weighted mean change 1.6 (1.5) mg/dl).

Meta-regression analysis for clinical outcomes
Change in low density lipoprotein cholesterol was
associated with and explained a statistically significant
degree of variability in the log risk ratio for coronary
heart disease events, coronary heart disease death, and
total death in univariable and multivariable meta-
regression analysis adjusted for change in high density
lipoprotein cholesterol and different drug classes
(table 2). For example, the risk ratio for coronary
heart disease events (death or non-fatal myocardial
infarction) was reduced, on average, by 7.1% (95%
confidence interval 4.5% to 9.8%; P <0.001) per

10 mg/dl (0.26 mmol/l) reduction in low density
lipoprotein cholesterol
in a multivariable model.
Change in low density lipoprotein cholesterol
explained 32% of the variability in the log risk ratio
for coronary heart disease events (see R2 for univari-
able model with low density lipoprotein cholesterol in
table 2).

We found no significant association of change in high
density lipoprotein cholesterol with the log risk ratio in
any model after adjustment for changes in low density
lipoprotein cholesterol (see table 2 and results of
analyses stratified by drug class in web table A). For
example, the risk ratio for coronary heart disease
events was increased, on average, by 16% (−4.2% to
36.9%; P=0.12) per 10 mg/dl increase in high density
lipoprotein cholesterol according to our multivariable
model in table 2. Change in high density lipoprotein
cholesterol hardly explained any variability in any of
the outcomes (see R2 results in table 2 and web table A).
The change in the quotient of low density lipoprotein
cholesterol and high density lipoprotein cholesterol
explained 32%, 12%, and 15% of the variability in log
risk ratios for coronary heart disease events, total death,
and coronary heart disease death, which is no more
than the change in low density lipoprotein cholesterol
alone explained for these outcomes (see R2 results for
univariable models with low density lipoprotein
cholesterol in table 2).

Sensitivity analyses focusing on a more homoge-
neous sample of trials (interventions known to raise
high density lipoprotein cholesterol and excluding
trials using agents associated with harmful effects)
revealed a significant association of change in high
density lipoprotein cholesterol and the log risk ratio for
coronary heart disease events in univariable analysis,
with a 29% (51.7% to 6.6%; P=0.01) risk reduction for
each 10 mg/dl increase in high density lipoprotein
cholesterol (table 3). This association was, however, no
longer detectable in models adjusted for changes in low
density lipoprotein cholesterol (bivariable or multi-
variable), indicating that the apparent reduction in
outcomes was due to the association of changes in high
density lipoprotein cholesterol with changes in low
density lipoprotein cholesterol. Change in low density
lipoprotein cholesterol remained significantly asso-
ciated with the log risk ratio for coronary heart disease
events, explaining greater variability in trials that had
longer follow-up (R2 of 0.41, 0.46, and 0.51 for trials
with a follow-up of six months or more, more than one
year, and more than two years). Two additional
sensitivity analyses focusing on trials with inter-
ventions specifically chosen to raise high density
lipoprotein cholesterol and on trials reporting inten-
tion to treat results did not show any significant
association of change in high density lipoprotein
cholesterol with risk of coronary heart disease events.
Similarly, we found no association between change
in triglycerides and risk of coronary heart disease
events whenever the model included an adjustment for
the change in low density lipoprotein cholesterol (data
available from the authors). Change in low density

lipoprotein cholesterol, however, remained a signifi-
cant predictor in a multivariable model adjusting for
change in high density lipoprotein cholesterol, change
in triglycerides, and class of intervention, with a 7.4%
(4.4% to 10.4%; P <0.001) relative risk reduction for
coronary heart disease events.

Model residuals were normally distributed with
constant variance (homoscedasticity). Including quad-
ratic or exponential terms did not improve the fit of
models. We found no evidence of collinearity.

DISCUSSION
This systematic review and meta-regression analysis of
108 randomised controlled trials using lipid modifying
interventions did not show an association between
treatment mediated change in high density lipoprotein
cholesterol and risk ratios for coronary heart disease
events, coronary heart disease deaths, or total deaths
whenever change in low density lipoprotein choles-
terol was taken into account. We found a statistically
significant, substantial association between change in
low density lipoprotein cholesterol and risk ratios for
coronary heart disease events, coronary heart disease
deaths, or total deaths, adjusted for other lipid
subfractions and drug class. Our results indicate a 7%
relative risk reduction in coronary heart disease events
for every 10 mg/dl (0.26 mmol/l) reduction in low
density lipoprotein cholesterol, which is equivalent to a
10% relative reduction in coronary heart disease events
for every 10% decrease in low density lipoprotein
cholesterol; this is consistent with the magnitude of
reduction reported in current National Cholesterol
Education Program guidelines.8

Strengths and limitations
Strengths of this study include a comprehensive scope
that included a wide range of patients at risk of
cardiovascular events and a wide variety of lipid
modifying interventions, maximising the power of
our analysis. Our extensive literature search supple-
mented by contacting experts in the field to retrieve all
relevant eligible trials minimised the potential for
publication bias, but we cannot exclude it completely.
We could not include 50 otherwise eligible trials that
failed to measure or did not report follow-up values or
change in low density lipoprotein cholesterol or high
density lipoprotein cholesterol (for details see web
appendix). Unidentified trials or trials that failed to
report data on high density lipoprotein cholesterol or
low density lipoprotein cholesterol reduced the power
of our analysis but were unlikely to bias its results.

A meta-regression such as ours relies on variability
across studies in both the differences between high
density lipoprotein cholesterol in treatment and con-
trol groups and variability in magnitude of effect. Thus,
the analysis is powerful to the extent that it includes
studies in which differences in high density lipoprotein
cholesterol are modest (such as with statins) or non-
existent and studies in which differences are large
(niacin). Our analysis would have been stronger if we
had had access to data from additional studies in which

differences in changes in high density lipoprotein
cholesterol between treatment and control were large.
Nevertheless, variability was sufficient that if a strong
effect of high density lipoprotein cholesterol existed we
would probably have detected it.

To limit the risk of data driven spurious associations
and overfitting, we pre-specified a limited number of
predictors for our statistical models.38 We verified the
model assumptions of linearity, normality of residuals,
homoscedasticity, and absence of collinearity. In
addition, our results proved robust in several pre-
specified sensitivity analyses and were consistent with
other investigations that have examined similar data.8
Our systematic review is far more comprehensive than
previous studies on this subject.21

Nevertheless, the relation described by a meta-
regression is observational—that
is, although the
original studies may be randomised trials, a meta-
regression across trials does not have the benefit of
randomisation to support a causal interpretation and
thus risks bias by confounding. Moreover, regression
analysis typically ignores the effect of measurement
errors in the independent variables. Although this may
be problematic to the extent that older studies used less
precise methods to determine lipid subfractions, our
meta-regression involves mean values of the indepen-
dent variables. The standard errors of these means are
substantially smaller than the standard deviations of
individual participants’ values, which should mitigate
the problem.

Our classification of lipid modifying interventions
may be argued to combine antilipidaemic agents and
diets that have important pharmacological differences
or mechanisms of action37—for example,
in trials
classified under niacin treatment, niacin could be
combined with a statin, a fibrate, or a resin. Different
interventions that alter high density lipoprotein cho-
lesterol may have different impacts on cardiovascular
risk. Interventions may lead to different types of high
density lipoprotein cholesterol with differences in
function (see below); they may raise high density
lipoprotein cholesterol by reduced catabolism (which
may be detrimental) or increased production (more
likely to be beneficial). Our adjustment of the analysis
by type of intervention (drug class) deals with this
problem to a considerable extent but may not fully
solve it.

Finally, meta-regression relies on aggregated data
from studies rather than data from individual patients
—that is, the relation with patient averages across trials
may not be the same as the relation for patients within
trials. This is known as the ecological fallacy.34 There-
fore, ideally our results would be confirmed by an
analysis of data from individual patients, with a large
pooled dataset of trials testing lipid modifying inter-
ventions, such as data from the Cholesterol Treatment
Trialists’ Collaborators.39

No association exists between treatment induced change in high density lipoprotein
cholesterol and risk ratios for coronary heart disease events, coronary heart disease deaths, or
total deaths when changes in low density lipoprotein cholesterol are adjusted for

Whereas change in high density lipoprotein cholesterol failed to explain variability in risk ratios
for coronary heart disease events across studies, change in low density lipoprotein cholesterol
explained about one third of the variability

Scepticism about interventions to lower coronary heart disease risk by increasing the amount
of circulating high density lipoprotein cholesterol without considering effects on its function is
reinforced

density lipoprotein cholesterol does not necessarily
confer cardiovascular benefits.17-20 40 In the case of
torcetrapib, one of the most potent high density
lipoprotein raising agents to date, the failure to improve
intracoronary atheroma burden in ultrasound studies
and the excess mortality seen in the Investigation of
Lipid Level Management to Understand its Impact in
Atherosclerotic Events (ILLUMINATE) trial may be
explained by a molecule specific increase in blood
pressure (perhaps owing to increased concentrations of
aldosterone) or unforeseen interactions between torce-
trapib and atorvastatin.17 18 20 41 42 Recent data suggest
the former possibility43; if so, other cholesteryl ester
transfer protein inhibitors may still hold promise.

An alternative hypothesis would suggest that inhibi-
tion of the cholesteryl ester transfer protein leads to
production of dysfunctional high density lipoprotein
cholesterol with pro-inflammatory and atherogenic
properties.44 45 High density lipoprotein cholesterol
particles vary substantially in size, density, composi-
tion, and functional properties. The varying function-
ality of different high density lipoprotein cholesterol
subfractions most
likely affects their relation to
atherosclerosis.46-48 Lipid modifying agents and diets
may affect the functionality of high density lipoprotein
cholesterol. For example, recent data suggest that a low
fat, high fibre diet,
in combination with exercise,
converts high density lipoprotein cholesterol from a
pro-inflammatory to an anti-inflammatory state.49

Available measures of the function of high density
lipoprotein cholesterol include indices of inflamma-
tion, oxidation, monocyte chemotaxis, nitric oxide
production, endothelial function, and thrombosis, as
well as tests assessing the reverse cholesterol transport
effects of treatments.50 However, further development
is necessary to satisfy the urgent need for a reliable and
easily applicable assay of high density lipoprotein
cholesterol function.

Implications for clinical practice and future research
The lack of association between treatment induced
change in high density lipoprotein cholesterol and the

RESEARCH

risk of coronary heart disease events, coronary heart
disease deaths, or total deaths raises questions about the
rationale for development of therapeutic agents that
increase high density lipoprotein cholesterol. Raising
high density lipoprotein cholesterol without consider-
ing effects on high density lipoprotein function seem to
have little promise for the prevention of cardiovascular
events. Future research should prospectively consider
the results of assays to measure high density lipoprotein
function and then provide definitive evidence of
pharmacological effects on patient important out-
comes in long term randomised trials.50

Results from this study corroborate recommenda-
tions from current clinical guidelines (Adult Treatment
Panel III, American Heart Association/National
Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, and American
Diabetes Association) that emphasise targeting pri-
marily low density lipoprotein cholesterol
in the
prevention of cardiovascular morbidity and
mortality.8 51 52 Recent updates of the National Choles-
terol Education Program guidelines confirmed low
levels of high density lipoprotein cholesterol (<40 mg/
dl) as a major cardiovascular risk factor. Although the
guidelines recommend that clinicians should consider
combining a low density lipoprotein cholesterol low-
ering drug with a fibrate or niacin in patients with low
high density lipoprotein cholesterol, they refrained
from making recommendations about specific targets
for raising high density lipoprotein cholesterol
concentrations.8 9

Abstract
Objective To investigate and quantify the potential dose-response
association between egg consumption and risk of coronary heart disease
and stroke.
Design Dose-response meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies.
Data sources PubMed and Embase prior to June 2012 and references
of relevant original papers and review articles.
Eligibility criteria for selecting studies Prospective cohort studies
with relative risks and 95% confidence intervals of coronary heart disease
or stroke for three or more categories of egg consumption.
Results Eight articles with 17 reports (nine for coronary heart disease,
eight for stroke) were eligible for inclusion in the meta-analysis (3 081
269 person years and 5847 incident cases for coronary heart disease,
and 4 148 095 person years and 7579 incident cases for stroke). No
evidence of a curve linear association was seen between egg
consumption and risk of coronary heart disease or stroke (P=0.67 and
P=0.27 for non-linearity, respectively). The summary relative risk of
coronary heart disease for an increase of one egg consumed per day
was 0.99 (95% confidence interval 0.85 to 1.15; P=0.88 for linear trend)
without heterogeneity among studies (P=0.97, I2=0%). For stroke, the
combined relative risk for an increase of one egg consumed per day
was 0.91 (0.81 to 1.02; P=0.10 for linear trend) without heterogeneity
among studies (P=0.46, I2=0%). In a subgroup analysis of diabetic
populations, the relative risk of coronary heart disease comparing the
highest with the lowest egg consumption was 1.54 (1.14 to 2.09; P=0.01).
In addition, people with higher egg consumption had a 25% (0.57 to
0.99; P=0.04) lower risk of developing hemorrhagic stroke.

Conclusions Higher consumption of eggs (up to one egg per day) is
not associated with increased risk of coronary heart disease or stroke.
The increased risk of coronary heart disease among diabetic patients
and reduced risk of hemorrhagic stroke associated with higher egg
consumption in subgroup analyses warrant further studies.
Introduction
Cardiovascular disease is now a public health crisis, affecting
millions of people in both developed and developing countries.
Although the rate of death attributable to the disease has declined
in developed countries in the past several decades, it is still the
leading cause of death and extorts a heavy social and economic
toll globally.1-3 In low and middle income countries, the
prevalence of cardiovascular disease has increased dramatically.
By 2020, the disease is forecasted to be the major cause of
morbidity and mortality in most developing nations.4
In recent decades, concern has mounted regarding the high
prevalence and costs associated with cardiovascular disease,
with growing interest in altering risk factors and reversing this
global epidemic. Among the known risk factors for
cardiovascular disease, levels of low density lipoprotein (LDL)
cholesterol have aroused particular attention. In the Women’s
Health Study, after a mean follow-up of eight years, participants
with the highest levels of LDL cholesterol showed a notably
higher risk of cardiovascular events than those with the lowest
levels.5 In addition, several meta-analyses of observational
studies and randomized controlled trials have found that a
reduction in concentrations of LDL cholesterol could
significantly reduce the risk of coronary heart disease and stroke

incidence and mortality.6-9 Diet is an important determinant of
serum cholesterol, but dietary cholesterol has only a modest
contribution to plasma concentrations of LDL cholesterol.10 On
the other hand, dietary cholesterol may prompt the oxidation of
LDL and increase postprandial lipemia, which could raise the
risk of vascular disease.11 To minimize the elevation of blood
cholesterol and reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease, the
American Heart Association (AHA) has recommended the
public to consume less than 300 mg/day of cholesterol.12 13
Since eggs are a major source of dietary cholesterol, with one
large egg containing almost 210 mg of cholesterol, the public
has been recommended to limit egg consumption unless the
intake of other foods high in cholesterol is restricted.14 However,
eggs are also an inexpensive and low calorie source of many
other nutrients, including minerals, proteins, and unsaturated
fatty acids, which could lower the risk of cardiovascular
disease.15 Additionally, in populations following a carbohydrate
restricted diet, dietary cholesterol from eggs could increase
plasma concentrations of high density lipoprotein (HDL)
cholesterol,16 which has been suggested to protect against
vascular disease.17 18 Therefore, some organizations have
recommended that reducing egg intake might not be important
for healthy people with normal levels of cholesterol in the
blood.19 Food based dietary guidelines from countries including
Nepal, Thailand, and South Africa recommend consuming eggs
every day or regularly as part of a healthy diet.20
Several prospective cohort studies have examined the association
between egg consumption and risk of coronary heart disease
and stroke. However, the relation between egg consumption
and risk of cardiovascular disease remains controversial.
Therefore, we conducted a dose-response meta-analysis of
prospective cohort studies to quantify the association between
egg consumption and risk of coronary heart disease and stroke.
Methods
Search strategy
We conducted a literature search of PubMed (Medline) and
Embase from January 1966 through June 2012 for prospective
cohort studies examining the association between egg
consumption and risk of CHD and stroke. PubMed search terms
were “Cardiovascular Diseases”[MeSH] or “Stroke”[MeSH] or
“Coronary Disease”[MeSH] or “myocardial infarction”[MeSH]
or CHD) and egg. Similar search terms were used for Embase.
In addition, we scrutinized references from relevant original
papers and review articles to identify further pertinent studies.
No language restrictions were imposed. We followed the
standard criteria for conducting meta-analyses of observational
studies and reporting the results.21
Study selection
Studies were included in this meta-analysis if they satisfied the
following criteria: the study design was prospective, the
exposure of interest was egg consumption, the outcome was
coronary heart disease or stroke, and the investigators reported
relative risks with 95% confidence intervals for at least three
quantitative categories of egg intake. Additionally, we excluded
reviews, editorials, non-human studies, and letters without
sufficient data. Studies of other exposures and diseases were
also excluded. If study populations were reported more than
once, we used the result with the longest follow-up time.

Data extraction
Data extraction was carried out independently by two authors
(YR and LC) using a standard extraction form. We extracted
the following information from each study: authors, year of
publication, study name, study location, years of follow-up,
sample size (number of participants and incident cases),
participants’ characteristics (age and sex), endpoints (coronary
heart disease, stroke, or both), outcomes ascertainment, egg
consumption categories, covariates adjusted in the multivariable
analysis, and relative risks (95% confidence intervals) for all
categories of egg consumption.
Quality assessment was performed according to the
Newcastle-Ottawa quality assessment scale,22 which is a
validated scale for non-randomised studies in meta-analyses.
This scale awards a maximum of nine points to each study: four
for selection of participants and measurement of exposure, two
for comparability of cohorts on the basis of the design or
analysis, and three for assessment of outcomes and adequacy
of follow-up. We assigned scores of 0-3, 3.5-6, and 6.5-9 for
low, moderate, and high quality of studies, respectively. When
studies had several adjustment models, we extracted those that
reflected the maximum extent of adjustment for potentially
confounding variables.
For studies that reported egg intake as servings per week or day,
we assumed that each serving was equivalent to one egg. For
studies that lacked the unit of consumption, the categories were
estimated by multiplying the frequency of consumption from
the food frequency questionnaires with an average portion size
according to the mean intake derived from the 24 h diaries. We
contacted the authors if the data of interest were not directly
shown in the publications. To resolve discrepancies, we used
group consensus and consulted a third reviewer.
Statistical analysis
In this meta-analysis, the relative risks and 95% confidence
intervals were considered as the effect size for all studies, and
the hazard ratios were deemed equivalent to relative risks. Any
results stratified by sex were treated as two separate reports.
Those articles reporting both coronary heart disease and stroke
were also treated as two separate reports. Owing to the distinct
cut-off points for categories in different articles, we computed
a relative risk with 95% confidence interval for an increased
intake of one egg per day for each report. The method described
by Greenland and Longnecker23 and Orsini and colleagues24 was
used to calculate the trend from the correlated estimates for log
relative risk across categories of egg consumption. The amount
of egg consumption, distributions of cases and person years,
and relative risks and 95% confidence intervals were extracted
according to this method.
The median or mean egg consumption in each category was
used as the corresponding dose of consumption. The midpoint
of the upper and lower boundaries was considered the dose of
each category if the median or mean intake per category was
not available. If the highest category was open ended, the
midpoint of the category was set at 1.5 times the lower
boundary. If the number of cases and person years were not
available, we used the relative risks comparing the highest versus
lowest categories of egg intake to obtain a summary estimate.
In addition, we evaluated a potential curve linear association
between egg consumption and risk of coronary heart disease
and stroke, using restricted cubic splines with three knots at
percentiles 10%, 50%, and 90% of the distribution.25 A P value
for curve linearity or non-linearity was calculated by testing the

null hypothesis that the coefficient of the second spline is equal
to zero.
The heterogeneity among studies was estimated by the Cochran
Q test and I2 statistic.26 Heterogeneity was confirmed with a
significance level of P≤0.10. The I2 statistic describes the
percentage of total variation in point estimates that can be
attributed to heterogeneity. For the I2 metric, we considered
low, moderate, and high I2 values to be 25%, 50%, and 75%,
respectively.26 27 We used a fixed effect model (Mantel-Haenszel
method) when heterogeneity was negligible, and a random effect
model (DerSimonian and Laird method) when heterogeneity
was significant.28 Forest plots and funnel plots were used to
examine the overall effect and assess the publication bias,
respectively.
We also conducted analyses stratified by sex, study location,
number of cases and participants, duration of follow-up, repeated
egg consumption measurements, study quality, and whether
diet variables or cholesterol levels were controlled for in models.
All statistical analyses were performed with Stata version 11
(Stata Corp), and all tests were two sided with a significance
level of 0.05.

articles seemed to be relevant for this meta-analysis. After
evaluating the full texts of these 16 publications, we excluded
eight articles as follows. Two articles29 30 were excluded owing
to lack of sufficient data for estimation of relative risks. Another
two articles31 32 were excluded because they did not separately
report the relative risks and 95% confidence intervals for
coronary heart disease or stroke. We also excluded one report33
because it was the meeting abstract of the study by Scrafford
and colleagues.34 A study by He and colleagues35 was excluded
because it reported the intermediate follow-up results of Health
Professionals Follow-up Study. The final meta-analysis included
eight articles, of which four34 36-38 examined men and women
separately. For the study by Scrafford and colleagues,34 the
estimate of the association between egg consumption and stroke
mortality among men was imprecise because of sparse data, and
thus for this report we included only data for women. In total,
our meta-analysis included eight articles with 17 independent
reports.
Study characteristics
Tables 1⇓ and 2⇓ show the information extracted from the
included studies, all of which had prospective cohort designs
and participants with no prior diagnoses of cardiovascular
disease at baseline. The meta-analysis consisted of 263 938
participants with 3 081 269 person years of follow-up for
coronary heart disease, and 210 404 patients with 4 148 095
person years of follow-up for stroke. Among the participants,
we documented 5847 cases of coronary heart disease during
follow-up periods ranging from eight to 20 years, and 7579
cases of stroke during a follow-up ranging from 8.8 to 22 years.
Three cohorts37 39 40 were among Asians (Japan), and the
others34 36 38 41 42 were conducted in the United States. Egg
consumption was measured by food frequency questionnaires
in all studies. Four studies36 38 40 42 used repeated measurements
to update dietary information to more accurately reflect the
dietary intakes over follow-up. Results of study quality

assessment (score 0-9) yielded a score of 6.5 or above (high
quality) for all studies, with an average score of 7.6 (web
appendix, tables A and B).
Association between egg consumption and
risk of coronary heart disease
Six articles34 36 37 40-42 with nine reports were included in the
dose-response analysis of egg consumption and risk of coronary
heart disease. Using a restricted cubic splines model, we found
no evidence of a curve linear association between egg
consumption and risk of coronary heart disease (P=0.67 for
non-linearity; fig 2⇓). The summary relative risk of coronary
heart disease for an increase of one egg per day was 0.99 (95%
confidence interval 0.85 to 1.15; P=0.88 for linear trend). We
saw no heterogeneity among studies (P=0.97, I2=0%; fig 3⇓).
Additionally, Begg and Egger regression tests provided no
evidence of substantial publication bias (P>0.05 for both tests).
Among the included studies, two articles34 37 (four total reports)
examined the relation between egg consumption and risk of
coronary heart disease in populations with diabetes. Owing to
the lack of data for person years in diabetic populations, we
obtained the summary relative risk comparing the highest with
the lowest egg consumption for coronary heart disease in
diabetic patients (relative risk 1.54 (1.14 to 2.09); P=0.01; table
3⇓; web appendix, table C).
Association between egg consumption and
risk of stroke
This dose-response analysis involved six articles34 37-39 41 42 with
eight reports on egg consumption and stroke risk. We did not
find a curve linear association between egg consumption and
risk of stroke (P=0.27 for non-linearity; fig 4⇓). The combined
relative risk of stroke for an increment of one egg consumed
per day was 0.91 (95% confidence interval 0.81 to 1.02; P=0.10
for linear trend; fig 5⇓). No heterogeneity of effect estimates
on relative risks was observed (P=0.46, I2=0%). Neither the
Begg test nor the Egger test for publication bias reached
significance (P>0.05 for both tests). In addition, three
articles34 37 39 with four reports provided information on fatal
stroke (pooled relative risk 0.94 (0.80 to 1.10); P=0.46; table
3). Moreover, four articles38 39 41 42 reported results for different
types of stroke, and three articles34 41 42 provided results for stroke
in those with diabetes. For these studies, the combined relative
risks comparing the highest versus lowest egg intake were 0.75
(0.57 to 0.99) for hemorrhagic stroke, 0.91 (0.82 to 1.01) for
ischemic stroke, and 0.80 (0.29 to 2.15) for total stroke among
people with diabetes (table 3; web appendix, table D).
Subgroup analyses
Subgroup analyses were conducted to examine the stability of
the primary results (table 3). The associations between egg
consumption and risk of coronary heart disease and stroke were
similar in subgroup analyses, which were defined by sex, study
location, number of cases or participants, duration of follow-up,
repeated egg consumption measurements, study quality, and
whether diet variables or cholesterol levels were controlled for
in models. An increment of one egg consumed per day did not
significantly increase risk of coronary heart disease or stroke
in any of the categories.
Discussion
This meta-analysis identified no significant association between
egg consumption and risk of coronary heart disease or stroke.
Higher intake of eggs (up to one egg per day) was not associated

with risk of coronary heart disease or stroke. Similar results
were obtained in subgroup analyses. However, among diabetic
participants, higher egg consumption was associated with a
significantly elevated risk of coronary heart disease. On the
other hand, higher egg intake was associated with a lower risk
of hemorrhagic stroke. These subgroup results should be
interpreted with caution, because only a few studies focused on
diabetic participants and particular stroke subtypes.
Results in relation to other studies
To date, the majority of prospective studies have found no
significant association between egg consumption and risk of
coronary heart disease or stroke. However, Burke and
colleagues43 analyzed data from 514 Western Australian
aborigines with almost 14 years of follow-up and found that
risk of coronary heart disease increased in participants
consuming eggs more than twice per week. But this study was
small and analyzed multiple dietary and lifestyle exposures.
Some studies have found an inverse association between egg
consumption and stroke risk. For example, an analysis of the
Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
1988-1994 (NHANES III) dataset found a significant inverse
association between higher egg consumption and stroke
mortality among men.34 A cohort study from Japan found that
increased consumption of animal products (including eggs) was
associated with reduced risk of total and hemorrhagic stroke
death.39
We considered several potential reasons for the lack of an overall
association between egg consumption and coronary heart disease
or stroke. Although dietary cholesterol influences plasma
concentrations of serum cholesterol, the effects are relatively
small.10 In addition, epidemiologic studies have found weak or
little association between dietary cholesterol intake and
cardiovascular disease risk.10 Apart from dietary cholesterol,
saturated fat and dietary patterns might also influence blood
cholesterol levels,44-46 suggesting that compliance with general
dietary recommendations instead of simply reducing egg
consumption could have a greater effect on the risk of
cardiovascular disease. Additionally, individual differences in
response to dietary cholesterol vary greatly, which could affect
the association between egg consumption and risk of coronary
heart disease and stroke. Moreover, several studies have shown
that egg consumption favors the formation of larger LDL and
HDL particles, which might enhance protection against
atherosclerosis.47 48
Other than cholesterol, eggs are a good source of other nutrients
such as high quality protein and vitamin D. In the Diet, Obesity,
and Gene (Diogenes) Project, increased protein consumption
together with a modest reduction in glycemic index was
beneficial for weight control.49 Substituting protein for
carbohydrate also partly resulted in lower blood pressure,
improved lipids levels, and concomitantly reduced
cardiovascular risk.50 Higher vitamin D intake might have
beneficial effects on the reduction of visceral adipose tissue51
and other cardiovascular risk factors52.
Another possibility is that lifestyle factors associated with egg
consumption might have obscured a positive association between
egg consumption and risk of coronary heart disease and stroke.
However, regular egg consumption tends to be associated with
unhealthy lifestyle factors such as smoking and physical
inactivity.34 36 53 Higher consumption of eggs is also likely to be
associated with increased consumption of red and processed
meats.36 These confounding factors tend to exaggerate rather
than mask the association between egg consumption and

cardiovascular disease risk. One study found that participants
with high levels of cholesterol in the blood were more likely to
reduce their egg consumption than others.40 However, our
subgroup analysis showed that the association between egg
consumption and coronary heart disease was similar in the
models, with or without adjustment for cholesterol levels.
Recently, a cross sectional study assessed the total plaque area
in patients attending Canadian vascular prevention clinics to
determine whether the atherosclerosis burden was related to
dietary egg intake.54 The study found a strong positive
association between the number of egg yolks and the degree of
atherosclerosis measured by plaque areas. However, the study
did not assess or adjust for other dietary or lifestyle factors and
did not examine hard cardiovascular disease endpoints. The
cross sectional nature of the study also limited causal
interpretation of the data. Therefore, the results from this cross
sectional analysis should be interpreted with caution.55 The
findings from our meta-analyses of prospective cohort studies
do not support a positive association between egg consumption
and cardiovascular disease outcomes in the general population.
Subgroup analyses have suggested a positive association
between egg consumption and coronary heart disease risk in
diabetic patients. Among diabetic populations, decreased plasma
levels of apolipoprotein E, together with increased levels of
apolipoprotein C-III could lead to abnormal cholesterol
transport, which might increase the risk of coronary heart
disease.56 57 The adverse effect of egg consumption on
lipoprotein profile and glycemic control could contribute to the
elevated risk of coronary heart disease in diabetic populations.
In addition, insulin sensitivity could influence HDL metabolism
and cholesterol transport.58 59 Riemens and colleagues60 found
that people with lower insulin sensitivity had increased levels
of plasma cholesterol, very low density lipoprotein cholesterol,
and LDL cholesterol, compared with those with higher insulin
sensitivity. Activities of plasma lecithin, cholesterol acyl
transferase, phospholipid transfer protein, and hepatic lipase
were negatively correlated with insulin sensitivity, which could
have enhanced reverse cholesterol transport.60 These findings
suggest a biological mechanism for possible adverse effects of
insulin resistance on risk of coronary heart disease in diabetic
populations through cholesterol metabolism. Nonetheless, this
subgroup finding of a positive association between egg
consumption and coronary heart disease risk was based on a
small number of studies and thus needs to be replicated in further
studies.
Several prospective cohort studies showed that hemorrhagic
stroke had an inverse association with serum levels of
cholesterol.61-64 In particular, the result of a meta-analysis
including 13 cohorts from China and Japan showed that
decreased cholesterol concentrations conferred an increased
risk of hemorrhagic stroke.65 It has been suggested that low
cholesterol levels promote necrosis of medial muscle cells and
reduce platelet aggregability, which could lead to plasmatic
arterionecrosis and the incidence of hemorrhagic stroke.66 67 It
is unclear whether the inverse association between egg
consumption and hemorrhagic stroke is mediated through low
levels of serum cholesterol or other mechanisms. Since this
subgroup finding was based on a small number of studies, the
results should be interpreted with caution.
Strengths and limitations
Our study has several strengths. Our meta-analysis included
prospective cohort studies with large sample size and long
duration of follow-up, which significantly increased the

statistical power to detect potential associations. We investigated
a dose-response relation between egg consumption and risk of
coronary heart disease and stroke, allowing us to examine the
shape of this possible association. Linear and non-linear relations
were also tested to quantify the associations. In addition, we
used models adjusting for most established risk factors and did
stratified analyses to explore whether some factors could explain
the results.
Several limitations of our study should also be acknowledged.
Firstly, errors in measurement of egg intake and other dietary
habits could have attenuated individual study results and led to
the null association between egg consumption and risk of
coronary heart disease and stroke. All the studies in our analysis
assessed egg consumption using food frequency questionnaires,
several of which have been validated with reasonable
reproducibility and validity of self reported egg intake. However,
misreporting of intake was still inevitable.68-70
The cooking methods of eggs and the amount of salt added to
eggs were not available in most of the included studies. The
nutrient contents of eggs could alter depending on different
cooking methods or feeding methods of chicken. In addition,
we could not uniformly quantify the size of eggs in each study.
Moreover, participants with higher egg intake consumed more
dietary cholesterol and protein but fewer carbohydrates and
were more likely to have lower levels of education than those
with lower egg intake.34 36 Several studies adjusted for those
confounding factors. To reduce this bias, we conducted a
stratified analysis and found the results to be robust in different
strata of covariates.
Secondly, during the long follow-up, participants may have
changed their diets. However, in our meta-analysis, nearly half
the included studies updated the diet information from food
frequency questionnaires. Stratified analysis indicated that the
associations between egg consumption and risk of coronary
heart disease and stroke were similar, regardless of whether
repeated egg consumption measurements were considered.
Thirdly, some studies considered the intake of foods in which
egg was the main ingredient. However, the results suggested
that the amount of eggs estimated in other foods was relatively
small and was unlikely to affect the aforementioned associations.
Finally, the statistical power was limited in subgroup analyses
of diabetic patients or subtypes of stroke.
Conclusions
In summary, results from our meta-analysis do not support that
higher egg consumption is associated with elevated risk of
coronary heart disease and stroke. Subgroup analyses suggest
a positive association between higher egg intake and risk of
coronary heart disease in diabetic patients, and an inverse
association between higher egg consumption and incidence of
hemorrhagic stroke. Studies with larger sample sizes and longer
follow-up times are warranted to confirm these subgroup results.

What is already known on this topic

Cardiovascular disease affects millions of people in both developed and developing countries
As a major source of dietary cholesterol, eggs have been investigated by several epidemiologic studies in relation to risk of coronary
heart disease and stroke
However, whether egg consumption increases the future risk of coronary heart disease and stroke remains unclear

What this study adds

Consumption of up to one egg per day was not associated with increased risk of coronary heart disease or stroke
Subgroup analysis suggested that consumption of up to one egg per day was associated with a significantly elevated risk of coronary
heart disease in diabetic populations, and a reduced risk of hemorrhagic stroke

Fish Consumption and Incidence of Stroke

A Meta-Analysis of Cohort Studies

Ka He, MD, ScD; Yiqing Song, MD; Martha L. Daviglus, MD, PhD; Kiang Liu, PhD;
Linda Van Horn, PhD; Alan R. Dyer, PhD; Uri Goldbourt, PhD; Philip Greenland, MD

Background and Purpose—Results from observational studies on fish consumption and risk of stroke are inconsistent. We
quantitatively assessed the relationship between fish intake and incidence of stroke using a meta-analysis of cohort
studies.

Methods—We searched the Medline and Embase databases (1966 through October 2003) and identified 9 independent
cohorts (from 8 studies) that provided a relative risk (RR) and corresponding 95% CI for total or any type of stroke in
relation to fish consumption. Pooled RR and 95% CI of stroke were estimated by variance-based meta-analysis.

Results—Compared with those who never consumed fish or ate fish less than once per month, the pooled RRs for total
stroke were 0.91 (95% CI, 0.79 to 1.06) for individuals with fish intake 1 to 3 times per month, 0.87 (95% CI, 0.77 to
0.98) for once per week, 0.82 (95% CI, 0.72 to 0.94) for 2 to 4 times per week, and 0.69 (95% CI, 0.54 to 0.88) for ⱖ5
times per week (P for trend⫽0.06). In stratified analyses of 3 large cohort studies with data on stroke subtypes, the
pooled RRs across 5 categories of fish intake were 1.0, 0.69 (95% CI, 0.48 to 0.99), 0.68 (95% CI, 0.52 to 0.88), 0.66
(95% CI, 0.51 to 0.87), and 0.65 (95% CI, 0.46 to 0.93) for ischemic stroke (P for trend⫽0.24); and 1.0, 1.47 (95% CI,
0.81 to 2.69), 1.21 (95% CI, 0.78 to 1.85), 0.89 (95% CI, 0.56 to 1.40), and 0.80 (95% CI, 0.44 to 1.47) for hemorrhagic
stroke (P for trend⫽0.31).

Conclusions—These results suggest that intake of fish is inversely related to risk of stroke, particularly ischemic stroke.
Fish consumption as seldom as 1 to 3 times per month may protect against the incidence of ischemic stroke. (Stroke.
2004;35:1538-1542.)

Key Words: cerebrovascular accident 䡲 fishes 䡲 meta-analysis

Ecological data indicate that fish consumption may be

associated inversely with ischemic stroke and positively
with hemorrhagic stroke.1,2 Data from the World Health
Organization on 36 countries showed an inverse association
between fish intake and stroke mortality.3 Long-chain
omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs),
including
eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid, which are
derived from marine foods, were thought to be the potent
nutrients in fish responsible for the low rate of ischemic
stroke and high rate of hemorrhagic stroke among those who
consumed large amounts of fish.4,5

A number of epidemiological studies have also examined
the relationship between fish intake and risk of stroke. The
preponderance of data derives from prospective cohort stud-
ies, but findings are conflicting. Some but not all cohort
studies reported an inverse association between fish con-
sumption and risk of stroke after adjustment for potential
confounders.6 –13 Differences in study populations, sample
size, assessment of fish intake, and stroke end point, as well

as adjustment for covariates, coupled with the fact that most
studies did not separate ischemic from hemorrhagic stroke,
may account for differences in assessing the effects of fish
consumption on stroke risk. To provide a reliable quantitative
assessment of the relationship of fish intake with stroke risk,
we conducted a meta-analysis of all prospective cohort
studies with relevant data. We also attempted to explore the
major sources of heterogeneity among the reported studies.

Materials and Methods

Study Selection
All relevant cohort studies published in English-language journals
from 1966 to October 2003, which reported the association between
fish consumption and stroke, were identified by searching Medline
and Embase using the terms “fish,” “seafood,” “animal products,”
“omega-3 fatty acids,” “n-3 fatty acids,” “stroke,” “cerebrovascular
event,” and “cardiovascular disease.” Additional information was
retrieved through a hand search of references from relevant articles
and recent reviews. Two of our investigators (K.H., Y.S.) indepen-
dently reviewed all relevant articles and identified eligible studies.

Discrepancies were resolved by group discussion. In general, articles
were included if the studies were cohort studies, and the relative risks
(RRs) and their corresponding 95% CIs of stroke relating to each
category of fish consumption were reported. We identified 8 studies
that provided an RR and corresponding 95% CI for total or type of
stroke in relation to the amount or frequency of fish consumption.
One study,9 which estimated RR and 95% CI for men and women
separately, was counted as 2 separate cohorts in the meta-analysis.

Data Extraction
The data we collected included the first author’s name, year of
publication, country of origin, duration of follow-up, range or mean
of participants’ age, sample size, proportion of men, number of
events, categories of fish intake, the amount of fish intake for each
category, methods for measurement of fish intake, and adjusted
covariates, as well as RRs and 95% CIs of total stroke and stroke
subtypes in the corresponding categories. RRs transformed to their
natural logarithms (ln), and the 95% CIs were used to calculate the
corresponding SEs.

To standardize fish intake, we first converted frequency into
grams per day. The amount of fish consumption (grams per day) was
estimated by multiplying the frequency of consumption (servings per
day) by the corresponding portion size (grams per serving). For
example, the derived average portion size in the Health Professional
Follow-Up Study was 105 g/serving. The range of fish consumption
for 1 to 3 times per month was converted to 3.5 g/day (105/30) to
10.5 g/day. When the portion size of fish intake in an individual
study was not available from the published article, the value was
determined on the basis of data from the 2 largest cohort studies (the
Nurses’ Health Study and the Health Professional Follow-Up Study),
considering that the food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) used in
these 2 studies has been validated.14,15 If the uppermost amount of
the highest fish intake category was uncertain (eg, fish intake was
ⱖ5 times per week), we assigned 1 daily serving of fish as the upper
limit.

Statistical Analysis
Fish consumption was categorized into 5 standardized intervals:
“never or less than once per month, ” “1 to 3 times per month, ” “once
per week,” “2 to 4 times per week,” and “ⱖ5 times per week.” We
created a data set by assigning each RR extracted from each
individual study into its corresponding standardized interval accord-
ing to the range or median amount of fish intake in the category. If
the median amount of fish consumption from more than 1 category
in a single study fell into the same standardized category of fish
intake in our meta-analysis, we pooled these RRs and used the
combined estimate for that category. Also, if the range of fish intake
covered more than 1 standardized category, we allocated RR on the
basis of the median fish intake. We estimated the pooled RRs and
95% CIs of stroke for each standardized category of fish consump-
tion compared with the lowest category using both fixed- and
random-effects models. In the fixed-effects model, the pooled RR
was obtained by averaging the ln RRs weighted by the inverses of
their variances.16 In the random-effects model, DerSimonian and
Laird’s method was used to further incorporate the between-study
variability.17 We reported the pooled estimate from the random-
effects model if the test for heterogeneity was significant. Formal
tests of between-study heterogeneity were performed using a ␹2 test.
To test for linear trend, a weighted linear regression was used to
model the ln RR for stroke as a function of continuous fish intake
derived from the median intake of each category using the inverse of
the variance as the study weight.

In stratified meta-analyses, we examined potential sources of
heterogeneity,
including gender, methods of dietary assessment
(FFQ versus in-person interview), and subtypes of stroke (ischemic
and hemorrhagic).16 All analyses were performed using STATA
statistical software (Version 7.0; STATA Corp).

Results

The final data set for our meta-analysis included 9 cohorts
from 8 independent studies comprising 200 575 participants

1539

(3491 stroke events) aged 34 to 103 years. Of the 9 cohorts,
6 were from the United States, 1 from Europe, 1 from China,
and 1 from Japan. The sample sizes varied across studies
from 552 (Zutphen Study)6 to 79 839 (Nurses’ Health
Study).11 The average duration of follow-up was 12.8 years
(range 4 to 30 years). Data on fish consumption were
collected by in-person interviews (5 cohorts) or using self-
administered FFQs (4 cohorts). Fish intake in each individual
study was classified into 2 to 5 categories. All reported RRs
(95% CIs) of stroke or stroke subtypes in each study were
adjusted for multiple covariates (Table 1).

Compared with those who never consumed fish or ate fish
less than once per month, individuals with higher fish intake
had lower risk of total stroke (Table 2). The reduction in risk
of total stroke was statistically significant for fish intake once
per week (RR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.77 to 0.98). Beneficial effects
on stroke risk appeared to increase with greater fish intake.
For individuals who ate fish ⱖ5 times per week, the risk of
stroke was lower by 31% (RR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.54 to 0.88).
However, the test for linear trend was statistically nonsignif-
icant (P for trend⫽0.06). In addition, there was no evidence
for the presence of significant heterogeneity among the 9
cohorts (␹2

8⫽12.5; P⫽0.13; see Figure).

In the stratified analyses, the inverse association between
fish intake and risk of stroke was slightly attenuated among
men. Also, this association was somewhat weaker in studies
using in-person interviews (Table 2). On the basis of 3 large
studies that provided data on stroke subtypes, we found an
inverse threshold association between fish intake and ische-
mic stroke. The risk of ischemic stroke was reduced signifi-
cantly by eating fish 1 to 3 times per month. For hemorrhagic
stroke, we did not observe any significant association with
fish intake (Table 2). Given the nonlinear relations between
fish consumption and stroke risk, we further dichotomized
fish intake as less than once per month versus at least once per
month. The pooled RR for those who consumed fish at least
once per month were 0.85 (95% CI, 0.79 to 0.91) for total
stroke, 0.67 (95% CI, 0.58 to 0.78) for ischemic stroke, and
1.06 (95% CI, 0.82 to 1.37) for hemorrhagic stroke.

Discussion

Our meta-analysis of cohort studies suggests an inverse
association between fish consumption and risk of stroke,
particularly ischemic stroke, although there was not a strong
dose-response relationship. The findings suggest that eating
fish as seldom as 1 to 3 times per month may reduce risk of
ischemic stroke.

Most studies included in our meta-analysis had a large
sample size and long-term follow-up periods that increased
the statistical power to examine the overall associations of
fish intake and incidence of stroke. The prospective study
designs also minimized selection bias and recall bias. Al-
though randomized placebo-controlled trials are the most
definitive tool for evaluation of the causality of diet– disease
relations,
to conduct a long-term,
large-scale, randomized trial on fish consumption and stroke
because of
feasibility considerations such as long-term
compliance.

The study also has limitations. One concern is that most studies
did not separate ischemic from hemorrhagic stroke. Therefore, our
capacity to examine fish intake in relation to stroke subtypes was
limited. Because of the distinct pathogeneses of these 2 types of
stroke, the underlying relationship between fish intake and stroke
risk may be somewhat attenuated by combining ischemic and

hemorrhagic stroke in the analysis. Alternatively, our pooled results
of total stroke would mostly reflect the relationship between fish
consumption and risk of ischemic stroke because most studies were
conducted in western countries, where ischemic stroke is the major
type of stroke. Of note, 1 of the included studies10 was conducted in
China, where one third or more cases might be hemorrhagic

stroke.18 In addition, 1 study in a Japanese population found that
high intake of fish was inversely associated with death caused by
intracerebral hemorrhage but not with death caused by cerebral
infarction.

Because our analyses are based on observational studies,
certain limitations of such studies may have affected our
findings. For example, the individual RR estimate included in
the meta-analysis was adjusted for different covariates in the
different studies. Thus, the possibility of residual confound-
ing resulting from inclusion of different factors or bias
attributable to measurement errors cannot be excluded. Al-
ternatively, a meta-analysis on the basis of individual data
with subsequent adjustment for identified covariates may
provide a more powerful approach. In addition, differences in

RR of stroke incidence for ﬁsh intake 2 to 4 times per week vs
⬍1 time per month in 9 cohorts from 8 prospective cohort stud-
ies. Adjusted covariates in each study are listed in Table 1.
Squares indicate the adjusted RR in each study. The size of the
square is proportional to the percent weight of each study in the
meta-analysis; the horizontal lines represent 95% CI. Studies

*Data were analyzed de novo for the meta-analysis.

follow-up period, dietary assessment method, and measure-
ment of the stroke end point, coupled with the fact that most
studies enrolled only men, might
lead to difficulties in
estimating true effects of fish intake on stroke risk. However,
our stratified analyses did not support
the presence of
substantial effect modification by gender or dietary assess-
ment method. Moreover, misclassification of fish intake was
still possible when we standardized fish consumption, al-
though most studies provided data on portion size and the
range of fish intake for each exposure category.

Fish intake may also be a surrogate for some other
underlying healthy lifestyle factors that protect against
stroke.19 –21 For example, individuals with higher fish con-
sumption generally tended to exercise more, smoke less, and
were less likely to be overweight. Although most of the
included studies were well designed and adjusted for major
dietary and lifestyle variables, we could not exclude com-
pletely the possibility that the inverse association between
fish intake and stroke is partly explained by undefined
healthy lifestyle factors.

The possibility of publication bias is always a concern in a
meta-analysis. Although we do not have enough statistical
power to formally test for publication bias, there was no
apparent tendency for the smaller cohorts to report much
larger effect estimates compared with the larger studies. More
importantly, the inverse associations between fish intake and
risk of stroke appeared to be consistent across most studies.
Thus, the likelihood that these findings are largely a result of
selective publication seems to be minimal. However, a
potential bias resulting from excluding studies published in
other languages (if any) is possible.

Beneficial effects of fish intake on ischemic stroke are
biologically plausible. Fish is the main dietary source of
long-chain omega-3 PUFAs. Such marine-derived long-chain
omega-3 PUFAs have been shown to have multiple favorable
effects on blood pressure, arrhythmias, lipid profile, platelet

1542

aggregation, and endothelial function22–24 that may reduce the
risk of ischemic stroke. Conversely, the antiplatelet effect and
the observation of high incidence of hemorrhage in Eskimos,
who consume large amounts of fish, have raised concerns
about possible adverse effects of high fish intake on risk of
hemorrhagic stroke. In the present meta-analysis, we did not
observe any significant association between fish intake and
hemorrhagic stroke. One possible explanation is that the risk
of hemorrhage with high fish consumption is somehow
balanced by other benefits of fish intake such as lowering
blood pressure. Presumably, the overall effect of fish intake
on hemorrhagic stroke may be minor.

Numerous experimental studies have indicated protective
effects from the use of fish oil supplements on cardiovascular
diseases. However, the dose of long-chain omega-3 PUFAs
used in the experimental studies is much higher than the
amount typically found in the diet. It is not clear how much
intake of long-chain omega-3 PUFAs may be required to
significantly reduce risk of stroke. In addition, whether fish
consumption provides other beneficial nutrients not present in
pure fish oil remains uncertain. Because a small amount of
fish intake was associated with significantly lower risk of
ischemic stroke,12 the possibility of interactions between
long-chain omega-3 PUFAs and some unknown constituents
in fish providing synergistic effects cannot be ruled out.
Accordingly, one should be cautious when advising people to
use fish oil supplements instead of eating whole fish. More-
over, considering the different amounts of
long-chain
omega-3 PUFAs in different types of fish, one would expect
to observe more benefit by eating fatty fish rich in long-chain
omega-3 PUFAs if any beneficial effect of fish intake on risk
of stroke is largely attributable to its content of long-chain
omega-3 PUFAs. However, data are very limited regarding
the effect of intake of different types of fish on stroke risk.
Finally, some potentially important issues, such as how fish is
cooked might modify benefits of fish consumption and what
is the optimal way to cook fish, remain unanswered and call
for future research.

In summary, our meta-analysis of all relevant cohort
studies indicated an inverse association between fish con-
sumption and stroke, particularly ischemic stroke. The inci-
dence of ischemic stroke might be significantly reduced by
consuming fish as seldom as 1 to 3 times per month. Because
of scarce data,
the effect of fish intake on the risk of
hemorrhagic stroke remains equivocal. Further studies are
required to better understand the potentially different effects
of fish consumption on risk of stroke subtypes by gender and
in different ethnic groups.

Meta-Analysis of Wine and Beer Consumption

in Relation to Vascular Risk

Augusto Di Castelnuovo, MS; Serenella Rotondo, MS; Licia Iacoviello, MD, PhD;

Maria Benedetta Donati, MD, PhD; Giovanni de Gaetano, MD, PhD

Background—Many epidemiological studies have evaluated whether different alcoholic beverages protect against
cardiovascular disease. We performed a meta-analysis of 26 studies on the relationship between wine or beer
consumption and vascular risk.

Methods and Results—General variance-based method and fitting models were applied to pooled data derived from 26
studies that gave a quantitative estimation of the vascular risk associated with either beverage consumption. From 13
studies involving 209 418 persons, the relative risk of vascular disease associated with wine intake was 0.68 (95%
confidence interval, 0.59 to 0.77) relative to nondrinkers. There was strong evidence from 10 studies involving 176 042
persons to support a J-shaped relationship between different amounts of wine intake and vascular risk. A statistically
significant inverse association was found up to a daily intake of 150 mL of wine. The overall relative risk of moderate
beer consumption, which was measured in 15 studies involving 208 036 persons, was 0.78 (95% confidence interval,
0.70 to 0.86). However, no significant relationship between different amounts of beer intake and vascular risk was found
after meta-analyzing 7 studies involving 136 382 persons.

Conclusions—These findings show evidence of a significant

inverse association between light-to-moderate wine
consumption and vascular risk. A similar, although smaller association was also apparent in beer consumption studies.
The latter finding, however, is difficult to interpret because no meaningful relationship could be found between different
amounts of beer intake and vascular risk. (Circulation. 2002;105:2836-2844.)

Key Words: cardiovascular diseases 䡲 wine 䡲 beer 䡲 meta-analysis

An inverse association between moderate alcohol con-

sumption and vascular risk has been shown in many
epidemiological studies.1– 6 All-cause mortality as a function
of alcohol use has been depicted as a J-shaped curve,6 – 8

We did a systematic review of the literature and a meta-
analysis of selected studies to evaluate the relationship
between wine and beer consumption and vascular risk. We
also tried to give a quantitative estimate of this relationship.

See p 2806

reflecting a lower risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) at
moderate consumption and an increased risk of certain
cancers and cirrhosis at higher amounts.1,6 –9 After wine
intake was suggested as a possible explanation for the lower
than expected CHD mortality rates in France,10 many studies
have dealt with the question of whether different alcoholic
beverages are equivalent in their ability to protect against
CHD or if a specific beverage might offer a greater protec-
tion,2– 4 but data are inconclusive.1,3,11,12 A recent advisory
from the American Heart Association13 concluded that the
usual standards to recommend alcohol consumption as a
CHD prevention approach are not met and that wine is
indistinguishable from other types of alcoholic beverages.
These conclusions have been challenged.14 –16

Methods

Search Strategy
First, a PUBMED search (http://www4.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/PubMed)
together with an assessment of the references of published studies
was conducted until September 2001 to identify studies evaluating
the relationship between alcohol consumption and vascular risk.
More than 80 publications were identified. Next, publications report-
ing risks specific for wine and/or beer intake were selected, and 30
studies were identified.17– 46 Some were multiple reports from the
same cohort.20,43,44 One study46 was excluded because neither
confidence intervals (CIs) nor precise probability values were
reported. A total of 26 reports were identified for the meta-analysis.
Two separate meta-analyses were conducted: the first used the 23
studies reporting data for wine,17–31,34 – 41 and the second used the 22
studies reporting data for beer.17–27,30 –39,42 Finally, the studies were

divided into 2 groups. The first group included studies that consid-
ered only a category of risk (drinkers versus nondrinkers), and the
second was formed by studies that reported “trend” analyses of risk,
ie, that considered more than one category of wine (beer) intake
(“dose-response” meta-analysis).

Data Extraction
Some studies17,20,29,31,32,34,39,40 had not taken the intake of different
types of alcoholic beverages into account (type A), whereas in others
(type B) the bias of combined drinking of different alcoholic
beverages in the same population was either formally excluded using
drinkers of only a specific type of beverages21–25,27,41,42 or was taken
into account in multivariate analyses of risk.18,19,26,28,30,33,35–37 In
studies reporting more than one clinical end point, results on
combined (fatal and nonfatal) events and on CHD with respect to

other vascular events were used. Relative risks were extracted as a
measure of the relation between vascular events and wine or beer
consumption (whatever the amount consumed in drinkers versus
nondrinkers meta-analysis and for each specific consumption cate-
gory in the dose-response meta-analysis). Whenever possible, the
amount of a “drink” (mL/d) was taken as quantified by each author
(as it occurred in all beer studies); otherwise, to allow meaningful
comparisons among different categorizations of wine intake, a
“drink” was considered equivalent
to 130 mL of wine. If not
otherwise reported in the study, it was assumed that wine contains
12% and beer 6% ethanol. Other sources of heterogeneity in the
methodological quality of the studies were taken into account by
performing sensitivity analysis,47,48 and prespecified subgroups were
considered according to type of cohort or event in case group, sex,
adjustment for different types of alcoholic beverages or for indicators

of social class level, presence of ex-drinkers or light drinkers in the
reference group, and use of the same reference group for both wine
and beer.

Statistical Analyses
In the drinkers versus nondrinkers meta-analysis, data were com-
bined using the general variance-based method49 that requires
information on the relative risks (RR) or odds ratios estimate and
their 95% CIs for each study. When no CIs were presented, they
were calculated by transforming probability values (2 studies).17,34
The 95% CIs were used to assess the variance and the relative weight
of each study. Adjusted RR, when available, was preferred. Publi-
cation bias was tested using funnel plot asymmetry.50 Results from
subgroup analyses were reported with 99% CI to account for
multiple comparisons. Data from studies reporting trend analysis
were pooled with a weighted, least-squares regression model.51 In
this method, the natural logarithm of the adjusted RR of vascular
disease was regressed as a function of beverage intake. Midpoints of
consumption categories were used for calculations. For open-ended,
high-intake categories, the midpoint of the category was estimated to
be 20% greater than the lower boundary specified by the original
investigators.51 Study effect was modeled with indicator variables.
This approach may be extended to fit a J-shaped trend, including
linear and quadratic terms. The full model

Wine
Drinkers Versus Nondrinkers Meta-Analysis
Thirteen studies on the association between wine intake and
vascular risk (11 on CHD and 2 on cerebrovascular disease
[CVD]) involved 201 308 persons (Table 1). Overall RR of
drinkers with respect to nondrinkers was 0.68 (95% CI, 0.59
to 0.77; Figure 1). No heterogeneity was observed (P⫽0.10).
Similar findings were obtained in prospective or case-control
studies. Test for sample-size bias failed to show a funnel plot
asymmetry (P⫽0.56). An extensive sensitivity analysis was
performed (Table 2). The inverse association of wine with
vascular risk remained statistically significant
in pooling
studies where either CHD or CVD were the only events
considered or that separately considered either nonfatal vas-
cular events or cardiovascular mortality. The RR of wine
drinkers was also significantly reduced in studies that for-
mally excluded ex-drinkers17,20,21,22,23 or “light or occasional”
drinkers18,19,22–29 from the reference group or that had adjusted
for different types of alcoholic beverages or for indicators of
social class level19 –27,29 or compared both wine and beer drink-
ing groups with the same reference group.18 –20,22–27 Six stud-
ies17,19,20,21,28,29 were conducted on men only, and meta-analysis

showed a RR of 0.87 compared with a RR of 0.53 in a pool of
the other studies that were conducted on both sexes.

Dose-Response Meta-Analysis
Ten studies reported trend analysis of the association
between different categories of wine intake and vascular
risk (7 on CHD and 3 on CVD) involving 176 042 persons
(Table 3). Dose-response curves (RRs at different amounts
of wine intake) for each study are reported in Figure 2. The
best fitting model includes a linear and a quadratic term
and was used to construct an average dose-response curve.
The complex relationship found was interpreted as a
J-shaped curve because, after an initial progressive de-
crease in the vascular risk by increasing amounts of wine,
the curve reaches a plateau at higher intake and tends to
revert at the highest amounts explored. When only the 7
prospective studies were considered,
the fitting of the
quadratic model considerably improved, and this was used
to construct the average dose-response curve in Figure 3. A
maximum reduction was predicted at 750 mL/day, but
statistical significance was only reached up to the amount
of 150 mL/day. In subgroup analysis, studies considering
CHD or CVD or cardiovascular mortality as separate end
points showed similar J-shaped curves that did not reach
statistical significance.

Beer

Drinkers Versus Nondrinkers Meta-Analysis
Fifteen studies on the association between beer intake and
vascular risk (13 on CHD and 2 on CVD) involved 208 096
persons (Table 1). Overall RR reduction in favor of beer
drinkers was 0.78 (95% CI, 0.70 to 0.86; Figure 4). No
heterogeneity (P⫽0.82) or funnel plot asymmetry (P⫽0.90)
was observed. Similar results were observed in prospective
and case-control studies and when studies in which CHD or
nonfatal vascular events were considered separately. Signif-
icant results were also obtained by pooling studies that had
adjusted for different types of alcoholic beverages or for
indicators of social class or excluded ex-drinkers17,20,21,22,23 or
light or occasional drinkers18,19,22–27,30 –32 from the reference
groups. The RR of beer drinkers was lower in the studies that
included both sexes than in those with only men; both results
were statistically significant.

Dose-Response Meta-Analysis
Seven studies reported trend analysis of the association
between different categories of beer intake and vascular risk
(5 on CHD and 2 on CVD); they involved 136 382 persons
(Table 3). Dose-response curves for each study are reported
in Figure 5. Both a linear and a quadratic model failed to

show any significant relationship between different amounts
of beer intake and vascular risk (Figure 5) when considering
either all studies or subgroups. The apparent continuously
decreasing risk with increasing beer consumption was not
statistically significant at any amount of beer, eg, at 750 mL
of daily beer intake, the predicted reduction of risk was 0.87
(95% CI, 0.57 to 1.33).

Discussion

Epidemiological studies have suggested that mortality and CHD
are lower for people who drink low-to-moderate amounts of
alcohol than for those who do not drink or who drink heavily.1–
11,53 Evidence obtained from this meta-analysis indicates an
average significant reduction of 32% of overall vascular risk
associated with drinking wine. Not only were nonfatal vascular
end points significantly reduced in wine drinkers, but so was
cardiovascular mortality. In studies with only men, the protec-
tion offered by wine was surprisingly small (13%) and not
significant, in contrast with studies enrolling both sexes (47%).
Whether women are more susceptible to the benefit of wine or
if they are more likely to drink lower amounts, thus taking its

maximal advantage,1,51,54 remains to be established. In relation
to the reported association between moderate alcohol consump-
tion and increased risk of breast cancer,51 our finding suggests
that the overall effect of moderate wine intake on women’s
health may actually be favorable. In agreement with the relation
between alcohol intake and all-cause mortality previously re-
ported,3,6 –9 we observed a J-shaped relationship between wine
intake and vascular risk suggesting that light-to-moderate wine
drinkers have lower vascular risk than either heavier drinkers or
nondrinkers.

Beer drinking was also associated with a reduced risk of
vascular events, although at an extent lower than that ob-
served with wine. A significant inverse association was still
apparent when only CHD was considered but, unlike with
wine, it did not reach statistical significance when CVD
events or cardiovascular mortality were separately evaluated,
likely due to the small number of available studies. Risk
reduction connected with beer drinking was smaller but,
unlike wine, still significant in studies in which only men
were included. This suggests that women might be particu-
larly responsive to alcohol itself rather than to the nonalco-

Wine and Beer Intake and Vascular Risk

2843

Strength and Potential Limitations of This
Meta-Analysis
The results of any meta-analysis, especially in nonexperimen-
tal epidemiology, may be invalid due to publication bias or
confounding effect.1 This was not the case here, because no
sample size bias could be shown by funnel plot, nor were the
results affected by any of the adjustments considered. Self-
reported wine or beer consumption is thought to be inaccu-
rate. Underreporting on wine or beer drinkers would, how-
ever, result in a tendency for RRs to be biased toward the null
hypothesis, whereas our meta-analysis showed significant
associations. Errors in reporting beer intake might have
contributed to our failure to draw any statistically significant
dose-response curve from studies on this beverage.

Irregular (binge) drinkers may be frequent in cohorts of
beer drinkers and might have obscured a possible dose-
dependent risk reduction in regular beer drinkers. The choice
of nondrinkers as a reference group has been questioned
because this group may include ex-drinkers who have quit
because of health problems.1,3,7,20 We performed a subanaly-
sis restricted to studies that excluded either ex-drinkers or
very light or occasional drinkers from the reference group,
but the estimated overall risk still seemed to be significantly
reduced. The relative 10% overall difference between the RR
of wine versus beer drinkers was unchanged in studies that
assessed both wine and beer drinking versus the same
reference group. However, the potential confounding effect
of the combined drinking of different types of alcoholic
beverages in the same population was excluded by pooling
data from studies that had taken this issue into consideration.
Uncontrolled confounding by other known risk factors can
also be reasonably excluded because the great majority of
studies were adjusted for these variables; in particular, the
overall results were confirmed by analyzing subgroups from
studies that also adjusted for indicators of social class.

Conclusions
Association does not prove cause and effect, but the presence
of a dose-response relation in wine meta-analysis, although of
a complex, J-shaped type, is of importance.1,51 Definite proof
could only be obtained by large long-term intervention trials.
Such trials seem to be unfeasible for several reasons, includ-
ing ethical concerns. The evidence for the benefit connected
with wine consumption should, therefore, critically include
molecular and cell biology studies, animal and observational
epidemiological studies, and their meta-analyses.53,55 On this
basis, what should cardiologists advice their patients regard-
ing wine or beer consumption?13–16,53 First, patients and their
relatives should be informed of what lifestyle changes might
be beneficial to them. Besides insisting on the control of risk
factors, abstainers should be informed that in the absence of
contraindications and in the context of healthy eating and
lifestyle, low-to-moderate wine consumption may contribute
to better health. People who are already regular light-to-
moderate wine consumers should be encouraged to continue.
The hazards of excess drinking should always be highlighted,
and heavy drinkers should be pushed to cut their consumption
to a moderate level.

Background: Fruit and vegetables is a heterogeneous food group with different content of dietary ﬁber,
vitamins, minerals, carotenoids, and bioactive phytochemicals. Our objective was to examine the relation
between speciﬁc consumption of fruit and vegetable subgroups and stroke risk in a cohort of Swedish
women and men.
Methods and results: We prospectively followed 74,961 participants (34,670 women and 40,291 men)
who had completed a food frequency questionnaire in the autumn of 1997 and were free from stroke,
coronary heart disease, and cancer at baseline. Diagnoses of stroke in the cohort during follow-up were
ascertained from the Swedish Hospital Discharge Registry. A total of 4089 stroke cases, including 3159
cerebral infarctions, 435 intracerebral hemorrhages, 148 subarachnoid hemorrhages, and 347 unspeciﬁed
strokes, were ascertained during 10.2 years of follow-up. The multivariable relative risk (RR) of total
stroke for the highest vs. lowest category of total fruit and vegetable consumption was 0.87 (95%
conﬁdence interval [CI] 0.78e0.97; P for trend ¼ 0.01). The association was conﬁned to individuals
without hypertension (corresponding RR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.71e0.93; P for trend ¼ 0.01). Among individual
fruits and vegetable subgroups, inverse associations with total stroke were observed for apples/pears
(RR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.80e0.98; P for trend ¼ 0.02) and green leafy vegetables (RR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.81e1.04;
P for trend ¼ 0.03).
Conclusion: This study shows an inverse association of fruit and vegetable consumption with stroke risk.
Particularly consumption of apples and pears and green leafy vegetables was inversely associated with
stroke.

1. Introduction

High consumption of fruit and vegetables has been associated
with lower risk of stroke [1]. Fruit and vegetables is a heteroge-
neous food group with different content of dietary ﬁber, vitamins,
minerals, carotenoids, and other bioactive phytochemicals.
It
remains unclear which fruit and vegetable subgroups that are most
protective against stroke. Consumption of speciﬁc fruit and vege-
table subgroups, such as apples and pears [2e4], citrus fruits [3,5,6],
berries [7,8], cruciferous vegetables [5,6,9], leafy vegetables [5,9],
and root vegetables [6,9] has been inconsistently associated with
risk of stroke in previous studies. Moreover, studies on fruit and
vegetable consumption in relation to risk of hemorrhagic stroke are
limited [7,10].

To further examine the association between consumption of
total fruits and vegetables, speciﬁc fruits, and vegetable subgroups
and risk of total stroke and stroke types, we used data from two
large prospective cohorts of Swedish women and men.

2. Methods

2.1. Study population

We used data from two prospective population-based cohorts of
Swedish women and men, namely the Swedish Mammography
Cohort (SMC) and the Cohort of Swedish Men (COSM). In the
autumn of 1997, 39 227 women (SMC) and 48 850 men (COSM)
who lived in central Sweden (Uppsala, Västmanland, and Örebro
counties) completed a 350-item questionnaire that sought infor-
mation on diet,
lifestyle factors, and other factors that could
affect the risk of chronic diseases. For the present analyses, we
excluded women and men with an erroneous or a missing National

148

S.C. Larsson et al. / Atherosclerosis 227 (2013) 147e152

Registration Number and those with implausible values for total
energy intake (i.e., 3 SDs from the loge-transformed mean energy
intake). We further excluded those with a previous stroke, coronary
heart disease, or cancer at baseline. After these exclusions, 74 961
participants (34 670 women and 40 291 men), 45e83 years of age,
remained for the analyses. The Regional Ethical Review Board at
Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm, Sweden, approved this study.

2.2. Baseline data collection

Information about education, weight, height, smoking, physical
activity, aspirin use, history of hypertension and diabetes, family
history of myocardial infarction before 60 years, alcohol consump-
tion (type of alcoholic beverage and frequency of consumption), and
diet was obtained through a self-administered questionnaire. We
classiﬁed participants into three groups based on their highest re-
ported education/school (elementary school, secondary school/
vocational school, and university). Participants were classiﬁed as
having diabetes if they self-reported diabetes on the questionnaire
or had a diagnosis of diabetes recorded in Swedish National Inpa-
tient Register or the Swedish National Diabetes Register. History of
hypertension was based on self-report only. We calculated pack-
years of smoking history by multiplying the number of packs of
cigarettes smoked per day by the number of years of smoking. Body
mass index was calculated as the weight in kilograms divided by the
square of height in meters. Participants reported their level of
activity at work, home/housework, walking/bicycling, and exercise
as well as inactivity (watching TV/reading) and hours per day of
sitting/lying down and sleeping. The time per day reported by the
subject to have engaged in each activity was multiplied by the
activity’s typical energy expenditure requirement expressed in
metabolic equivalents. The metabolic equivalent-hours for all
individual activities (including inactivity) reported by the subject
were added together to create a metabolic equivalent-hours per day
(24-h) score [11]. Spearman correlation coefﬁcient between total
activity score estimated from the questionnaire and two 7-day
activity records, performed 6 months apart, was 0.56 [11].

2.3. Dietary assessment

Fruit and vegetable consumption was assessed with a food-
frequency questionnaire (FFQ) on which participants indicated
their average consumption of 96 foods and beverages over
the previous year. Participants could choose from 8 predeﬁned
frequency categories, ranging from never to 3 or more times per day.
The FFQ included the following fruit and vegetable items: apples
and pears; bananas; orange and other citrus fruits; other fruits;
berries; spinach; lettuce and green salad; cabbages (cabbage and
red cabbage); cauliﬂower; broccoli and Brussels sprouts; carrots;
beetroots; tomatoes and tomato juice; sweet pepper; onion and
leek; garlic; green peas; and mixed vegetables. For the present
study, the exposures of interest were consumption of total fruit and
vegetables, total fruit, total vegetables, speciﬁc fruits and vegetables,
and vegetable subgroups. We combined speciﬁc vegetables into the
following subgroups: green leafy vegetables (including spinach,
lettuce, and green salad), cruciferous vegetables (white cabbage and
red cabbage, cauliﬂower, broccoli, and Brussels sprouts), and root
vegetables (carrots and beetroots). The remaining vegetable items
on the FFQ were examined separately, as were the fruit items. We
deﬁned the reported times eaten per day as the number of servings.
For example, consumption of apples one time per day was deﬁned
as one serving of apples per day. In a validation study in a subsample
of 129 women from the SMC using a similar FFQ (including 60
foods), the Pearson correlation coefﬁcients between the FFQ and
four 1-week diet records (completed 3e4 months apart) ranged

from 0.4 to 0.5 for fruit items and from 0.4 to 0.6 for vegetable items
(A. Wolk, unpublished data).

2.4. Case ascertainment

Cases of ﬁrst stroke that occurred in the cohort were ascertained
by linkage to the Swedish Hospital Discharge Registry. The strokes
were classiﬁed as cerebral infarction (International Classiﬁcation of
Diseases 10th Revision code I63), hemorrhagic stroke (I61 and I60),
and unspeciﬁed stroke (I64). Information on dates of death for
deceased participants was obtained from the Swedish Death
Register.

2.5. Statistical analysis

infarction,

Participants contributed follow-up time from January 1, 1998
until the date of diagnosis of stroke, death, or end of follow-up
(December 2008), whichever occurred ﬁrst. We categorized partic-
ipants into ﬁve frequency categories of consumption of total fruit
and vegetables (1st to 99th percentile: 0.5e13.0 servings/d), total
fruit (0.1e5.5 servings/d), and total vegetables (0.1e9.3 servings/d).
Because of the narrow range of consumption of speciﬁc fruits and
vegetables and the uneven distribution of
individuals across
frequency categories, the number of individuals (and person-years)
in each category varied. Cox proportional hazards regression models
were used to estimate relative risks (RR) with 95% conﬁdence
intervals (CI) of total stroke, cerebral
intracerebral
hemorrhage, and subarachnoid hemorrhage. Separate analyses of
women and men showed similar associations. Therefore, we report
results for women and men combined, adjusting for sex as a stratum
variable in the Cox model. We also adjusted all models for age
(in months) as a stratum variable. In the multivariable models, we
additionally adjusted for known risk factors for stroke, including
smoking status and pack-years of smoking (never; past < 20, 20e39,
or 40 pack-years; or current < 20, 20e39, or 40 pack-years),
education (less than high school, high school, or university), body
mass index (<20, 20e24.9, 25e29.9, or 30 kg/m2), physical activity
(metabolic equivalent-hours/day, quintiles), aspirin use (never, 1e6
tablets/week, 7 tablets/week), history of hypertension (yes or no),
history of diabetes (yes or nor), family history of myocardial infarc-
tion before 60 years of age (yes or no). All multivariable models were
also adjusted for total energy intake (kcal/day, continuous variable)
(to account for over- or underreporting in the FFQ) as well as dietary
factors that are associated with risk of stroke in these cohorts and
previous studies, including consumption of alcohol, coffee, fresh red
meat, processed meat, and total ﬁsh (all in quintiles). Further
adjustment for intakes of low-fat dairy foods, poultry, whole grains,
nuts, legumes, chocolate, sugar, dietary fat, ﬁber, and sodium did not
change the results materially. Therefore, those variables were not
included in the multivariable model. Total fruit and total vegetable
consumption was mutually adjusted by including both variables in
the same multivariable model. Likewise, in the multivariable anal-
yses of speciﬁc fruits and vegetable subgroups, the individual fruit
items and vegetable subgroups were included in the same model
and adjusted for each other.

Tests for trends were conducted by assigning the median value
for each category and modeling this variable as a continuous vari-
able. We conducted analyses stratiﬁed by history of hypertension to
assess potential interaction with this variable. Test for interaction
was performed by using the likelihood ratio test. We also per-
formed a sensitivity analysis conﬁned to individuals without dia-
betes at baseline because diabetics may have changed their fruit
and vegetable consumption after their diabetes diagnosis and they
are at higher risk for stroke. All analyses were conducted with SAS
Version 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). All statistical tests were

2-sided. P values < 0.05 were considered statistically signiﬁcant.
This study had about 80% power (at a ¼ 0.05) to detect an RR of
total stroke of 0.87 for the highest vs. lowest category of total fruit
and vegetable consumption. The corresponding RRs were 0.85 for
cerebral infarction, 0.6 for intracerebral hemorrhage, and 0.4
subarachnoid hemorrhage.

3. Results

Over a mean follow-up of 10.2 years, we ascertained a total of
4089 cases of stroke (1680 in women and 2409 in men), including
3159 cerebral
infarctions, 435 intracerebral hemorrhages, 148
subarachnoid hemorrhages, and 347 unspeciﬁed strokes. Baseline
characteristics of the study population according to total fruit and
vegetable consumption are shown in Table 1. Compared with
participants with a low fruit and vegetable consumption, those
with a high consumption were more likely to have a postsecondary
education but were less likely to be overweight, physically inactive,
to have a history of hypertension, and to be current smokers. On
average, those with a high fruit and vegetable consumption also
consumed more fresh red meat and processed meat. Mean total
fruit and vegetable consumption was higher in women (5.0  2.8
servings/d) than in men (3.8  2.3 servings/d). Spearman correla-
tion between total fruit and total vegetables was 0.44. Baseline
characteristics across categories of total fruit and total vegetables
were similar to that observed for total fruit and vegetables.

Total

fruit and vegetable consumption was

signiﬁcantly
inversely associated with risk of total stroke, cerebral infarction,
and hemorrhagic stroke (Table 2). For example, women and men in
the highest category of total fruit and vegetable consumption had
a 13% lower risk of total stroke compared with those in the lowest
category. Total fruit consumption was signiﬁcantly inversely asso-
ciated with total stroke and hemorrhagic stroke, whereas

total vegetable consumption was nonsigniﬁcantly inversely asso-
ciated with total stroke and cerebral infarction (Table 2). In a dosee
response analysis, the risk of total stroke decreased with increasing
fruit and vegetable consumption to a consumption of about 5
servings per day where the association seemed to reach a plateau
(Fig. 1).

The inverse association between fruit and vegetable consump-
tion and risk of stroke was similar when women and men with
a history of diabetes were excluded. In analyses restricted to indi-
viduals without diabetes at baseline, the multivariable RRs of total
stroke for the highest vs. the lowest category of consumption were
0.85 (95% CI, 0.76e0.96; P for trend ¼ 0.004) for total fruit and
vegetables, 0.85 (95% CI, 0.76e0.96; P for trend ¼ 0.007) for total
fruit, and 0.88 (95% CI, 0.78e1.00; P for trend ¼ 0.09) for total
vegetables.

The association between total fruit and vegetable consumption
stroke was modiﬁed by hypertension (P for
and risk of
interaction ¼ 0.04). The multivariable RRs of total stroke for the
highest vs. lowest category of total fruit and vegetable consumption
were 0.81 (95% CI, 0.71e0.93; P for trend ¼ 0.01) among those
without hypertension at baseline and 1.03 (95% CI, 0.85e1.25; P for
trend ¼ 0.82) among those with a history of hypertension. All
results were identical or similar when we removed history of
hypertension (a potential intermediate) from the multivariable
model. For example, the RR of total stroke for the highest compared
with the lowest category of total fruit and vegetable consumption
was 0.87 (95% CI, 0.78e0.97) after removing hypertension from the
model.

The association between speciﬁc fruits and vegetable subgroups
and risk of stroke is presented in Table 3. Consumption of apples/
pears, banana, citrus fruits, leafy vegetables, and onions and leeks
was signiﬁcantly inversely associated with risk of total stroke in the
age- and sex-adjusted analysis. After adjustment for other risk

b Adjusted for age, sex, smoking status and pack-years of smoking, education, body mass index, total physical activity, aspirin use, history of hypertension, diabetes, family
history of myocardial infarction, and intakes of total energy, alcohol, coffee, fresh red meat, processed meat, and ﬁsh. Total fruit and total vegetable consumption was mutually
adjusted by including both variables in the same multivariable model.

factors for stroke and mutually for other fruits and vegetable
subgroups, only the inverse relation between apple and pear
consumption and risk of total stroke remained signiﬁcant, whereas
results for the other fruit and vegetable subgroups became
nonsigniﬁcant. Leafy vegetables consumption was inversely asso-
ciated with total stroke and cerebral infarction in the trend analysis
but not when comparing highest vs. lowest category. There was
a positive association between berry consumption and risk of total
stroke and cerebral infarction. When we stratiﬁed the analysis by
history of hypertension, the multivariable RRs of total stroke for the
highest vs. lowest category of berry consumption were 1.07 (95% CI,
0.92e1.23) among those without hypertension and 1.22 (95% CI,
0.99e1.49) among those with hypertension. We observed no

association between speciﬁc vegetables and risk of total stroke
(data not shown), but onion and leek consumption was associated
with a nonsigniﬁcant lower risk (Table 3).

4. Discussion

This prospective study of Swedish women and men conﬁrms an
inverse association between total fruit and vegetable consumption
and stroke risk. The association appeared to be conﬁned to
participants without a history of hypertension. Consumption of
total fruits but not total vegetables was signiﬁcantly inversely
associated with stroke. Among fruit and vegetable subgroups, only
consumption of apples and pears and green leafy vegetables was
signiﬁcantly inversely associated with risk of total stroke after
adjustment for potential confounders. Other fruits and vegetable
subgroups were not signiﬁcantly inversely associated with risk of
stroke.

The reduction in stroke risk associated with increasing fruit and
vegetable consumption was most pronounced up to a consumption
of around 5 servings per day. Above that level of consumption, the
risk of stroke did not decrease materially with increasing fruit and
vegetable consumption.

Total

fruit and vegetable consumption has been inversely
associated with risk of total stroke in most previous prospective
studies. In a meta-analysis of 9 cohort studies, with a total of
4917 stroke cases, the summary RR of total stroke was 0.74 (95% CI,
0.69e0.79) for more than 5 servings of fruit and vegetables per day
compared with less than 3 servings per day [1].
In analysis
stratiﬁed by stroke types, the corresponding RRs were 0.72 (95%
CI, 0.66e0.79) for ischemic stroke (7 studies) and 0.73 (95% CI,
0.61e0.87)
In
the present study, which was based on a similar number of cases as
the meta-analysis, total fruit and vegetable consumption was
inversely associated with risk of cerebral infarction and intracere-
bral hemorrhage but not subarachnoid hemorrhage. In another
meta-analysis of 7 cohort studies, including 2955 stroke cases,
the risk of stroke decreased by 11% (95% CI, 7%e15%) and 3% (95%

for total hemorrhagic stroke (3 studies)

[1].

Fig. 1. Adjusted relative risks of stroke as a function of total fruit and vegetable
consumption. Data were ﬁtted by a restricted cubic spline Cox proportional hazards
model. The median consumption in the lowest category of fruit and vegetable
consumption (1.6 servings/d) was used as the reference for all relative risks. The
relative risks are indicated by the solid line, and the 95% conﬁdence intervals are
indicated by the dashed lines. Adjusted for the same variables as in the multivariable
model in Table 2.

55% of the consumption) was the only fruit and vegetable subgroup
that was signiﬁcantly inversely associated with risk of stroke [13].
We observed an unexpected increased risk of stroke associated
with berry consumption. The positive association was restricted to
those with hypertension. In this study population, strawberry was
the most commonly consumed berry contributing with about 60%
of total berry consumption. In a cohort of US women, strawberry

consumption was positively associated with stroke after adjust-
ment for lifestyle factors but was attenuated after further adjust-
ment for dietary factors [8]. In a cohort of Finnish men, total berry
consumption was inversely associated with risk of cerebral infarc-
tion (RR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.66e1.00, for >49 g/day vs. <12 g/day) [7].
We observed a nonsigniﬁcant inverse association between onion
consumption and stroke in the present study. In addition, green
leafy vegetable consumption was statistically signiﬁcantly inversely
associated with stroke risk, a ﬁnding that is consistent with
previous studies [5,9].

Fruit and vegetables contain many nutrients and bioactive
phytochemicals that may lower the risk of stroke. Increased fruit
and vegetable consumption has been shown to signiﬁcantly reduce
blood pressure [14]. As raised blood pressure is a strong risk factor
for stroke, the reduction in blood pressure by fruit and vegetable

152

consumption may, at least in part, explain the observed inverse
association between fruit and vegetable consumption and risk of
stroke. Fruit and vegetables are also rich sources of antioxidants,
such as vitamin C, carotenoids, and polyphenols (e.g., ﬂavonols).
A meta-analysis of 6 prospective studies showed that a high intake
of ﬂavonols, present in for example apples and onions (as well
as tea), was associated with a signiﬁcant 20% lower risk of stroke
[15]. Besides their antioxidant effects, polyphenols have anti-
inﬂammatory, vasodilating, and antithrombotic properties [16]
that may explain the beneﬁcial effect of
fruit and vegetable
consumption on stroke.

Major strengths of this study include its prospective and
population-based design, large sample size, large number of stroke
cases, and the virtually complete follow-up of participants through
linkage to population-based Swedish registries. This is the largest
prospective study to date on fruit and vegetable consumption in
relation to risk of stroke. This study also has limitations. First,
because of the observational design, we cannot exclude the possi-
bility of residual confounding due to unmeasured or imprecise
measurement of other risk factors for stroke. Second, consumption
of fruits and vegetables was assessed using a self-administered
questionnaire and was measured only once, at baseline. This
will inevitably lead to some measurement error in the assessment
of fruit and vegetable consumption. Because fruit and vegetable
consumption was assessed before diagnosis of stroke, any
measurement error would be nondifferential and most likely lead
to an underestimation of the true relation between fruit and
vegetable consumption and stroke. Finally, we did not have infor-
mation on some fruits for example grapes (a source of quercetin) or
types of berries.

In summary, ﬁndings from this prospective study indicate that
consumption of apples and pears and green leafy vegetables is
associated with a lower risk of stroke. Furthermore, this study
conﬁrms an inverse relation between total fruit and vegetable
consumption and risk of total stroke, cerebral
infarction, and
intracerebral hemorrhage. Results from this study lend further
support to the recommendation to increase fruit and vegetable
consumption.

Abstract

The consumption of fruit and vegetables is associated with a reduced rate of coronary heart disease (CHD) in observational

cohorts. The purpose of this study was to assess the strength of this association in a meta-analysis. Cohort studies were

selected if they reported relative risks (RRs) and 95% CI for coronary heart disease or mortality and if they presented a

quantitative assessment of fruit and vegetable intake. The pooled RRs were calculated for each additional portion of fruit

and/or vegetables consumed per day, and the linearity of the associations were examined. Nine studies were eligible for

inclusion in the meta-analysis that consisted of 91,379 men, 129,701 women, and 5,007 CHD events. The risk of CHD was
decreased by 4% [RR (95% CI): 0.96 (0.93–0.99), P ¼ 0.0027] for each additional portion per day of fruit and vegetable
intake and by 7% [0.93 (0.89–0.96), P , 0.0001] for fruit intake. The association between vegetable intake and CHD risk
was heterogeneous (P ¼ 0.0043), more marked for cardiovascular mortality [0.74 (0.75–0.84), P , 0.0001] than for fatal and
nonfatal myocardial infarction [0.95 (0.92–0.99), P ¼ 0.0058]. Visual inspection of the funnel plot suggested a publication bias,
although not statistically signiﬁcant. Therefore, the reported RRs are probably overestimated. This meta-analysis of cohort

studies shows that fruit and vegetable consumption is inversely associated with the risk of CHD. The causal mechanism of

this association, however, remains to be demonstrated. J. Nutr. 136: 2588–2593, 2006.

Introduction

Consumption of sufﬁcient amounts of fruit and vegetables are
recommended as part of a healthy diet. Fruit and vegetables may
reduce chronic diseases and more speciﬁcally, coronary heart
disease (CHD),5 by means of their protective constituents such
as potassium, folate, vitamins, ﬁber, and other phenolic com-
pounds (1). These nutrients act through a variety of mechanisms,
such as reducing antioxidant stress,
improving lipoprotein
proﬁle, lowering blood pressure, increasing insulin sensitivity,
and improving hemostasis regulation (1–3). However,
the
recommendation to eat fruit and vegetables to prevent chronic
diseases is mainly based on observational epidemiological
studies, which leaves much uncertainty regarding the causal
mechanism of this association.

Several cohort studies have examined the relation between
fruit and vegetable intake and coronary heart disease. The
results of these studies have been summarized in previous
reviews (4), and an earlier pooled analysis reported an inverse
association between intake of ﬁber from fruit and vegetables and
CHD risk (5). In general, these studies report a favorable re-

lation between fruit and vegetable consumption and CHD
occurrence, although sometimes the results are inconsistent.
Furthermore, the magnitude of the favorable association re-
mains uncertain because of differences in methodological
approaches, analytical techniques, and outcome deﬁnitions.
Two recent meta-analyses have reported an inverse association
between fruit and vegetable consumption and the occurrence of
stroke (6,7), which supports the idea that fruit and vegetable
consumption might protect against cardiovascular events.
Therefore, the objective of the present study was to assess,
through meta-analysis, the magnitude of the relation between
fruit and vegetable consumption and the risk of CHD. Only
cohort studies using quantitative methods of dietary intake
assessment were used for the present meta-analysis.

Methods

Search. We selected published prospective studies that assessed
the relation between CHD and the consumption of
fruit and/or
vegetables. The prespeciﬁed criteria were: 1) prospective studies, 2)
coronary heart disease, and 3) quantitative assessment of fruit and
vegetable intake.

Searches were conducted in electronic databases (Medline and
EMBASE) from 1970 to January 2006. References from the extracted
papers, reviews, and previous meta-analysis were also consulted to
complete the data bank. The electronic search includes both free-text and

MeSH terms and was performed with the support of the laboratory
librarian. Used terms were: ‘‘cardiovascular disease,’’ ‘‘heart disease,’’
‘‘ischemic heart disease,’’
‘‘coronary heart
disease,’’ ‘‘cohort studies,’’ ‘‘prospective studies,’’ ‘‘follow-up studies,’’
‘‘fruit,’’ and ‘‘vegetables.’’ No attempt was made to contact authors of
unpublished works or to ﬁnd articles in languages other than English.
Two investigators (L.D. and J.D.) performed data collection. Disagree-
ments were resolved by consensus.

‘‘myocardial

infarction,’’

We included in the analysis the cohorts’ reporting incidence of
relative risk (RR) for coronary heart events. When more than one
outcome was available we included, by order of priority: 1) fatal and
nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), 2) ischemic heart disease mortality
or coronary death, and 3) coronary heart disease incidence. Studies that
reported cardiovascular events only, or combined cerebro- and cardio-
vascular events, were excluded. Inclusion criteria for exposure variables
were fruit and/or vegetable consumption per se and not their represen-
tative nutrients. Thus, we included in the analysis only the following
food groups named in the articles:
‘‘all vegetables,’’
‘‘vegetables rich in carotenoı¨ds,’’ ‘‘fruit,’’ or ‘‘all fruit.’’ Individual fruit
or vegetables, such as tomatoes, garlic, beans, etc. were excluded. There
was no restriction on the method of dietary assessment provided that the
method involved a computation of the amount of fruit and vegetable
intake and not just the frequency of intake. Therefore, food intake was
assessed by means of food records, diet history methods, and food
frequency questionnaires. As long as the exposure variable was always
fruit and/or vegetables, the deﬁnition of this variable could vary among
studies. For instance, fruit juices were included with fruit in some studies
and potatoes were included with vegetables in others.

‘‘vegetables,’’

Literature and reference searches identiﬁed 20 studies (8–27). Four
were excluded because CHD events were pooled with cardiovascular
(8,9) or cerebrovascular events (10), therefore not permitting a separate
analysis of CHD events (11). Four studies were excluded because the
food frequency questionnaire did not assess the quantity of fruit and/or
vegetable intake (12–15). Three were excluded because there were
insufﬁcient data to extrapolate the relative risks (17–19). Data from the
ATBC study were taken from Hirvonen et al. (21) instead of Pietinen
et al. (20). The ﬁnal data set consisted of 9 independent studies (16,21–
27) comprising 221,080 subjects and 5007 events with a follow-up
between 5 and 19 y (Table 1).

Statistical methods. The method used in this analysis is described in
detail elsewhere (28). Brieﬂy, the RR of CHD for an increment in
1 standard portion/d of fruit and/or vegetable and related CI adjusted for
the largest number of potentially confounding variables (except dietary
variables such as vitamins, see Table 2 for the confounding variables)
were extracted from the original reports. Whenever the RR for a standard
portion was not available in the publication, it was calculated from the
RR of each category of fruit and/or vegetable intake as described
previously (29). The median values of fruit and/or vegetable intake for
each class were taken from the individual publication to calculate
exposure. If the data were unavailable, the median was estimated as the
midpoint of the class using the limits of the class provided in the original
article (28). When exposure was expressed in terms of frequency (21),
fruit and vegetable quantities were computed from the validation study.

When fruit and vegetable intake was expressed in g/d (11,20), the
exposure level was transformed into a standard portion by dividing this
quantity by 106 g. For the Health Professionals’ Follow-up Study and the
Nurses’ Health Study (24) the CI of RR were calculated from the original
article, assuming that the variance of the logarithm of RR was inversely
related to the number of events.

Heterogeneity among studies was assessed by the Cochran’s Q test.
The pooled estimates of the RRs were computed assuming a log-linear
lnRR ¼ bX, where X represents 1 portion of fruit and/or
model
vegetable and b the pooled weighted coefﬁcient of individual studies
using a random-effect model. To test the appropriateness of a log-linear
model, we plotted for each category of fruit and/or vegetable intake the
corresponding logarithm of RR in each individual study. Due to
insufﬁcient information, the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging
(27) was not included in the plot graph. The possibility of a publication
bias was assessed by funnel plot analysis and the Egger test (30). For this
analysis the results of
individual cohorts presented in the same
publication (22,24) were pooled.

Results

Nine cohorts were selected for the meta-analysis (Table 1 and
Table 2). Seven cohorts were from the U.S. and 2 were from
Finland. The sample size ranged from 501 in the Baltimore
Longitudinal Study of Aging to 75,596 in the Nurses’ Health
Study for a total number of 91,379 men and 129,701 women.
The range of follow-up duration was 5 to 19 y. The analysis
included 5007 CHD events.

Six cohorts reported an association between fruit and
vegetable intake and risk of CHD. The sample size was 48,039
men and 127,316 women, all of whom were from the U.S. The
end-points were: fatal and nonfatal MI in 3 studies, coronary
death in 2, and incident CHD in 1 study. The total number of
events was 3561. The RRs of CHD for each increment of
1 portion/d of fruits and vegetables varied between 0.79 and
0.97 (Fig. 1A). There was no evidence of heterogeneity among
studies (P ¼ 0.17). In a random-effect model the pooled RR
(95% CI) of CHD was 0.96 (0.93–0.99, P ¼ 0.0027).

Six cohorts reported data for fruit intake and CHD; the
results of the Mobile Clinic Social Insurance were presented in
men and women separately. The sample size was 67,304 men
and 117,108 women, of whom 153,907 were from the U.S. and
30,505 were from Finland. The end-points were: fatal and
nonfatal MI in 3 studies, coronary death in the others. The total
number of events was 3446. The RR of CHD for each increment
of 1 portion/d of fruit varied from 0.81 to 0.95 (Fig. 1B). There
was no evidence for heterogeneity among studies (P ¼ 0.91). In a
random-effect model
for each
increment of 1 portion/d of fruit was 0.93 (0.89–0.96, P ,
0.0001).

Figure 1 Pooled estimate of relative risk (RR) and 95% CI of ischemic heart
disease (IHD) rates for one portion increment per day of ‘‘fruit and vegetable’’
(A), fruit (B) and vegetables (C). Open squares indicate adjusted RR in each
study and are inversely related to RRs variance. Filled diamonds are pooled RR.
Horizontal line represents 95% CI.

Seven cohorts reported the association between vegetable
intake and risk of CHD; the results of the Mobile Clinic Social
Insurance were presented in men and women separately. The
sample size was 82,524 men and 117,108 women, of whom
169,127 were from the U.S. and 30,505 from Finland. The end-
points were: fatal and nonfatal MI in 4 studies and coronary
death in the others. The total number of events was 3833. The
RRs for each additional portion of vegetable/d varied from 0.60
to 0.98 (Fig. 1C). There was evidence for heterogeneity among
studies (P ¼ 0.004). In a random-effect model the pooled RR
(95% CI) of CHD for each additional portion of vegetables/d
was 0.89 (0.83–0.95, P ¼ 0.0023). The RR (95% CI) of fatal
and nonfatal MI (4 studies) was 0.95 (0.92–0.99, P ¼ 0.0058),
and the RR for mortality (3 studies) was 0.74 (0.75–0.84, P ,
0.0001), with no evidence of heterogeneity (P ¼ 0.66 and P ¼
0.36, respectively).

The scatter-plots of the association between fruit and fruit
and vegetable intake and RRs from the individual studies are
compatible with a linear relation (Fig. 2). The results are more
heterogeneous for vegetable consumption. Visual inspection of
the funnel plot (Fig. 3) suggests a publication bias although, the

The results of the present meta-analysis of cohort studies

decreased by 4% for each additional portion per day of fruit and
vegetables and by 7% for fruit consumption. The association
between vegetable intake and CHD risk is heterogeneous
depending on the outcomes. Finally, visual inspection of the
funnel plot suggest a publication bias, thus, the relative risks are
probably overestimated.

Clinical and biological investigations support the protective
effect of fruit and vegetables against CHD. Firstly, the relation is
biologically plausible with abundant clinical and laboratory
data demonstrating that the micro- and macro-constituents of
fruit and vegetables improve important risk factors of CHD,
such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes (1–3). Sec-
ondly, the association persists after adjustment on these risk
factor, suggesting a speciﬁc effect of fruit and vegetables.
Thirdly, the scatter-plot representation of the relation shows a
linear trend between fruit and vegetable intake and RR, which
supports a dose-response relation. In contrast, other facts are not
in favor of a causal relation. In population studies fruit and
vegetable intake correlates with healthy lifestyles, which may
explain the lower CHD rates. Generally, consumers of fruit and
vegetables smoke less, exercise more, and are better educated
than nonconsumers (31). Although most studies adjust for
lifestyle factors, residual confounders may still explain part of
the favorable association with CHD. High intakes of fruit and
vegetables are associated with a prudent diet pattern (32,33) and
inversely related to the consumption of saturated fat–rich food
(27), which may also contribute to the lower CHD risk (32–34).
Furthermore, the hypothetical mechanisms involved in the
protective effects of fruit and vegetables have not always been
conﬁrmed in randomized clinical trials (35–37). Therefore, the
results of the present study support the concept that the regular
consumption of fruit and vegetables is associated with low rates
of CHD, however, it does not establish a causal relation.

This study has several limitations. First, the ﬁnding of a
possible publication bias suggests that the values of the RRs are
probably overestimated. The reasons for this bias are not
known. One possible explanation may be that during the process
of selecting the publications we might have excluded a number
of critical studies. Among these, 4 presented nonsigniﬁcant
associations between vegetable intake and CHD (14,17–19) and
3 presented favorable associations (12,13,15). Second,
the
analysis of the relation between vegetable intake and CHD
risk revealed heterogeneity among studies (P ¼ 0.0043).
Analyses stratiﬁed by outcomes gave some clues to explain this
heterogeneity. The association between vegetable intake and
CHD risk was more pronounced for cardiovascular mortality
than for incident CHD. The reason for this difference is not
known. One possible explanation may be the publication bias.
Because mortality studies have fewer outcomes than studies
reporting incident CHD, their 95% CI of RRs are wider. Thus
associations (RRs) must be stronger to reach statistical signif-
icance. Alternatively, consumption of vegetables might have
speciﬁc effects on mortality, a hypothesis that needs conﬁrma-
tion in cohorts with large numbers of fatal outcomes. Third, the
meta-analysis is based on observational studies, which leaves the
possibility that residual confounding factors, including mea-
surement errors, affect the relation between fruit and/or vege-
table intake and CHD. Fourth, there were many differences
among studies,
the
variety of fruit or vegetables investigated, the deﬁnition of the
reference group, and the choice of exposure categories. These
differences could affect the estimation of the true relation. Fifth,
due to the limited number of studies, subgroup analyses to test

including dietary assessment methods,

2592 Dauchet et al.

the possible impact of gender, geographical area, and other
factors were not performed. Finally, 7 of 9 studies were
conducted in North America. Therefore, the results reﬂect the
association in this country and not necessarily in other parts of
the world where dietary habits and background may differ
substantially.

In conclusion, this analysis presents evidence of a beneﬁcial
association between fruit and vegetable consumption and CHD
risk, supporting the recommendation to eat a sufﬁcient amount
of fruit and vegetables to lower CHD risk. The strength of this
association, however, is still uncertain because of a possible
publication or selection bias. Furthermore, because observa-
tional studies do not control for unmeasured confounders, the
causal mechanisms remain to be established in randomized
controlled trials. Finally, this study also points out the limited
availability of cohort studies to analyze the relation between
fruit and/or vegetable intake and CHD risk in Europe and Asia.

ABSTRACT
Objective To conduct a comprehensive systematic review
and meta-analysis of studies assessing the effect of
alcohol consumption on multiple cardiovascular
outcomes.
Design Systematic review and meta-analysis.
Data sources A search of Medline (1950 through
September 2009) and Embase (1980 through September
2009) supplemented by manual searches of
bibliographies and conference proceedings.
Inclusion criteria Prospective cohort studies on the
association between alcohol consumption and overall
mortality from cardiovascular disease, incidence of and
mortality from coronary heart disease, and incidence of
and mortality from stroke.
Studies reviewed Of 4235 studies reviewed for eligibility,
quality, and data extraction, 84 were included in the final
analysis.
Results The pooled adjusted relative risks for alcohol
drinkers relative to non-drinkers in random effects models
for the outcomes of interest were 0.75 (95% confidence
interval 0.70 to 0.80) for cardiovascular disease mortality
(21 studies), 0.71 (0.66 to 0.77) for incident coronary
heart disease (29 studies), 0.75 (0.68 to 0.81) for
coronary heart disease mortality (31 studies), 0.98 (0.91
to 1.06) for incident stroke (17 studies), and 1.06 (0.91 to
1.23) for stroke mortality (10 studies). Dose-response
analysis revealed that the lowest risk of coronary heart
disease mortality occurred with 1–2 drinks a day, but for
stroke mortality it occurred with ≤1 drink per day.
Secondary analysis of mortality from all causes showed
lower risk for drinkers compared with non-drinkers
(relative risk 0.87 (0.83 to 0.92)).
Conclusions Light to moderate alcohol consumption is
associated with a reduced risk of multiple cardiovascular
outcomes.

INTRODUCTION
Possible cardioprotective effects of alcohol consump-
tion seen in observational studies continue to be hotly
debated in the medical literature and popular media. In

the absence of clinical trials, clinicians must interpret
these data when answering patients’ questions about
taking alcohol to reduce their risk of cardiovascular
disease. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses have
addressed the association of alcohol consumption
with cardiovascular disease outcomes1-8 but have not
uniformly addressed associations between alcohol
use and mortality from cardiovascular disease, as well
as the incidence and mortality from coronary heart dis-
ease and stroke. Additionally, further studies have
been published since 2006, when the most recent
reviews appeared. The continuing debate on this sub-
ject warrants an in depth reassessment of the evidence.
In this paper, we synthesise results from longitudinal
cohort studies comparing alcohol drinkers with non-
drinkers for the outcomes of overall mortality from
cardiovascular disease, incident coronary heart dis-
ease, mortality from coronary heart disease, incident
stroke, and mortality from stroke. Because of the
many biological effects of alcohol consumption, we
also examine the association of alcohol with mortality
from all causes when this is reported in studies. We
conducted meta-analyses for each of these outcomes
and a sensitivity analysis with lifetime abstainers as
the reference category to account for the heterogeneity
within the reference group of non-drinkers. We also
examined the effect of confounding on the strength of
observed associations. In our companion paper,110 we
link these cardiovascular outcomes with experimental
trials of alcohol consumption on candidate causal
molecular markers.

METHODS
Data sources and searches
We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis
following a predetermined protocol in accordance
with the Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epi-
demiology (MOOSE) reporting guidelines.9 We iden-
tified all potentially relevant articles regardless of
language by searching Medline (1950 through Septem-
ber 2009) and Embase (1980 through September

2009). Searches were enhanced by scanning bibliogra-
phies of identified articles and review articles, as well as
reviewing conference proceedings from three major
scientific meetings
(American Heart Association,
American College of Cardiology, and European
Heart Congress) between 2007 and 2009. Experts in
the field were contacted regarding missed, ongoing,
or unpublished studies.

To search electronic databases, we used the strategy
recommended for systematic reviews of observational
studies.10 We specified three comprehensive search
themes:
 To identify relevant terms related to the
exposure of interest (theme 1), the first Boolean
search used the term “or” to explode (search by
subject heading) and map (search by keyword)
the medical subject headings “ethanol” or
“alcohol” or “alcoholic beverages” or “drinking
behaviour” or “alcohol drinking” or text words
“drink$” or “liquor$” or “ethanol intake” or
“alcohol$ drink$” or “ethanol drink$”
 To identify relevant outcomes (theme 2), a
second Boolean search was performed using the
term “or” to explode and map the medical
subject headings “stroke” or “cardiovascular
diseases” or “myocardial infarction” or
“myocardial ischemia” or “coronary artery
disease” or “heart infarction” or text words
“cva$” or “infarct$” or “ischem$” or “cvd” or
“ami” or “ihd” or “cad”
 To identify relevant study designs (theme 3), a
final Boolean search using the term “or” to
explode and map the medical subject headings
“cohort studies” or “follow-up studies” or
“incidence” or “prognosis” or “early diagnosis”

page 2 of 13

or “survival analysis” or text words “course” or
predict$” or “prognos$” was performed.
These three comprehensive search themes were
then combined using the Boolean operator “and” in
varying combinations.

(SEB and PER)

Study selection
independently
Two individuals
reviewed all
identified abstracts for eligibility. All
abstracts reporting on the association between alcohol
intake and cardiovascular disease events were selected
for full text review. This stage was intentionally liberal.
We discarded only those abstracts that clearly did not
meet
the aforementioned criteria. The inter-rater
agreement for this review was high (κ=0.86 (95% con-
fidence interval 0.80 to 0.91)). Disagreements were
resolved by consensus.

The same reviewers performed the full text review of
articles that met the inclusion criteria and articles with
uncertain eligibility. Articles were retained if they met
the inclusion criteria for study design (prospective
cohort design), study population (adults ≥18 years old
without pre-existing cardiovascular disease), exposure
(current alcohol use with a comparison group of non-
drinkers), and outcome (overall cardiovascular disease
mortality or atherothrombotic conditions, specifically
incident coronary heart disease, coronary heart disease
mortality, incident stroke, or stroke mortality). Both
published and unpublished studies were eligible for
inclusion. Authors were contacted if the risk profile of
the cohort was unclear.

Data extraction and quality assessment
The primary exposure variable was the presence of
active alcohol drinking at baseline compared with a
reference group of non-drinkers. Because of the hetero-
geneity of this reference group, we identified the subset
of studies using lifetime abstainers as the reference group
and studies that distinguished former drinkers from non-
drinkers. Whenever available, we extracted information
on amount of alcohol consumed, using grams of alcohol
per day as the common unit of measure. When a study
did not specifically report the grams of alcohol per unit,
we used 12.5 g/drink for analysis.11 We standardised
portions as a 12 oz (355 ml) bottle or can of beer, a 5 oz
(148 ml) glass of wine, and 1.5 oz (44 ml) glass of 80 proof
(40% alcohol) distilled spirits. Volume of intake was cate-
gorised as <2.5 g/day (<0.5 drink), 2.5–14.9 g/day
(about 0.5–1 drink), 15–29.9 g/day (about 1–2.5 drinks),
30–60 g/day (about 2.5–5 drinks), and >60 g/day
(≥5 drinks).

The outcome variables of interest were defined as
the presence or absence of death from cardiovascular
disease (that is, fatal cardiovascular or stroke events),
incident coronary heart disease (fatal or non-fatal inci-
dent myocardial infarction, angina, ischaemic heart
disease, or coronary revascularisation), death from
coronary heart disease (fatal myocardial infarction or
ischaemic heart disease), incident stroke (ischaemic or
haemorrhagic events), or death from stroke. A second-
ary analysis was performed within these selected

studies to determine the association between alcohol
consumption and the risk of death from all causes.

Both reviewers independently extracted data from
all studies fulfilling the inclusion criteria, and any dis-
agreement was resolved by consensus. We extracted
the data elements of cohort name, sample size, and
population demographics (country, percentage male,
mean age or age range). We also extracted information
for key indicators of study quality in observational stu-
dies proposed by Egger et al10 and Laupacis et al.12
Specifically, we evaluated the effect on each outcome
of the number of potential confounding variables and
the number of years participants were followed.

Data synthesis and analysis
The relative risk was used as the common measure of
association across studies. Hazard ratios and incidence
density ratios were directly considered as relative risks.
Where necessary, odds ratios were transformed into
relative risks with this formula:
Relative risk=odds ratio/[(1–Po)+(Po×odds ratio)], in
which Po is the incidence of the outcome of interest
in the non-exposed group.13

The standard error of the resulting converted rela-

tive risk was then determined with this formula:
SElog(relative risk)=SElog(odds ratio)×log(relative
risk)/log(odds ratio).

Because these transformations can underestimate
the variance of the relative risks derived from the odds
ratios,14 15 we performed a sensitivity analysis that
excluded four studies for which this transformation
had been applied. All analyses were performed with
Stata 10.0 (StataCorp, College Station TX, USA).
The Stata “metan” command was used to pool the
ln(relative risks) across studies according to the
DerSimonian and Laird random effects model.16

In some studies, a single relative risk (or odds ratio)
was not available for drinkers versus non-drinkers
because the data were presented as only a dose-
response (that is, several alcohol consumption levels
relative to non-drinkers). In these cases, we first pooled
across levels of intake within the study using a random
effects model to derive a single relative risk for drinkers
versus non-drinkers. The resulting single, study-speci-
fic relative risk was then pooled with those of other
studies.

To visually assess the relative risk estimates and cor-
responding 95% confidence intervals across studies,
we generated forest plots sorted by year of publication.
Analyses were stratified by study quality criteria and
by participant characteristics.

To assess heterogeneity of relative risks across
studies, we inspected forest plots and calculated Q (sig-
nificance level of P≤0.10) and I2 statistics.17 18 In the
presence of heterogeneity, random effects models
were used (rather than fixed effects models) to obtain
pooled effect estimates across studies. Sensitivity

analyses and stratified analyses were performed to
assess the associations of selected study quality and
clinical factors on cardiovascular risk, including num-
ber of confounding factors and duration of follow-up
dichotomised at the median value. We also performed
a sensitivity analysis excluding studies reporting only
odds ratios. We conducted a cumulative meta-analysis
of studies ordered chronologically to assess the sequen-
tial contributions of studies published over time.19
Finally, we assessed evidence of publication bias
through visual inspection of funnel plots and Begg’s
rank correlation test for asymmetry.20 21

RESULTS
Identification of studies
Our initial search yielded a total of 4235 unique cita-
tions (fig 1). After two rounds of reviews and searching
citations of retained articles, we identified 131 studies
as potentially relevant for analysis. We excluded stu-
dies of cardiovascular outcomes predefined as ineligi-
ble (such as chronic congestive heart failure or stable
angina), non-atherothrombotic end points (such as
arrhythmias), composite end points, or non-cardio-
vascular outcomes (such as cancer), and duplicate
reports. This left 84 studies for our systematic review
and meta-analysis. Table 1 provides details of the
included studies. 22-105 Of these 84 studies, 34 (40%)
reported on all-male cohorts, six (7%) reported on
women only, and 44 (52%) included both men and
women.

Study quality
We evaluated two primary features of study quality—
the number of years that participants were followed
and adjustment for confounding. Duration of follow-
up for study end points ranged from 2.5 to 35 years,
with a mean follow-up of 11 years (standard deviation
6 years) (table 1). Of the included studies, 13 (15%) had
≤5 years of follow-up. Similarly, studies varied in the
degree of confounder adjustment, ranging from none
to 18 variables, with a mean of six (SD 4). Most studies
(68) presented adjusted estimates, but eight reported
only unadjusted estimates and another eight adjusted
only for basic demographic information. Methods of
adjustment, effect measure, and confounding variables
used in each study are presented in the appendix
1–5 on bmj.com for each of our primary
tables
outcomes.

Primary analyses of cardiovascular disease mortality,
coronary heart disease incidence and mortality, and stroke
incidence and mortality
For cardiovascular disease mortality and both end
points for coronary heart disease, alcohol consumption
was associated with lower risk, with relative risks of
about 0.75 (table 2). In general, relative risks derived
from the more highly adjusted and from the less
adjusted results were similar. Figures 2–4 reveal little
visual evidence of heterogeneity despite statistical evi-
dence of heterogeneity (P<0.001, I2=72.2%), probably
driven by the large number of participants (>1

Fig 3 | Forest plot of incident coronary heart disease associated with alcohol consumption

million). All the point estimates were <1.0 in studies,
except for one study for cardiovascular disease mortal-
ity and two studies for coronary heart disease incidence
and mortality.

In contrast, the overall associations of alcohol intake
with stroke incidence and mortality were close to null,
both in minimally adjusted and more highly adjusted
models (table 2, figs 5 and 6). However, this null asso-
ciation seemed to obscure nearly significant but oppo-
site associations with subtypes of
incident stroke.
Among the 12 studies on incident haemorrhagic
stroke, the pooled relative risk for current alcohol drin-
kers compared with non-drinkers was 1.14 (95% con-
fidence interval 0.97 to 1.34), whereas the eight studies
on ischaemic stroke showed a moderate reduction in
the pooled relative risk of 0.92 (0.85 to 1.00). Alcohol
use was not associated with stroke mortality, but few
studies
from

haemorrhagic or ischaemic stroke separately. Further-
more, only two studies reported relative risks on stroke
end points for former drinkers compared with non-
drinkers.

Analyses of dose response
Analyses of the dose of alcohol consumed showed that
2.5–14.9 g alcohol (about ≤1 drink) per day was protec-
tive for all five outcomes compared with no alcohol
(table 2). For coronary heart disease outcomes, all
levels of intake >2.5 g/day had similar degrees of risk
reduction. For cardiovascular disease mortality as well
as stroke incidence and mortality, the dose-response
relations were less clear and more consistent with U
or J shaped curves, suggesting an increased risk
among drinkers of greater amounts of alcohol. Specifi-
cally, those who consumed >60 g/day were at a signif-
icantly increased risk of incident stroke compared with
abstainers (relative risk 1.62 (1.32 to 1.98)).

Sensitivity analyses
In an analysis of differences in associations by sex, any
amount of alcohol consumption relative to none was
associated with greater reduction in cardiovascular dis-
ease mortality, stroke incidence, and stroke mortality
for women than men. However, the association with
stroke should be interpreted with caution, as the risk
estimates for women are based on only three pooled
studies. On the other hand, similar associations by
sex were observed for coronary heart disease inci-
dence and mortality (table 2).

Sensitivity analyses that were confined to only stu-
dies that controlled for the important confounders of
smoking, age, and sex revealed generally similar
results for all of the outcomes. Additional sensitivity
analyses that account for the median number of con-
founding variables in the multivariable analyses of
included studies revealed that those with fewer (less
than the median) confounding variables generally
reported slightly lower relative risk estimates. How-
ever, this pattern was inconsistent across the outcomes.
Specifically, an increased risk of stroke mortality was
observed for studies with limited adjustment for con-
founding. A similar trend was observed when consid-
ering the duration of follow-up. Using the pooled
median number of years as the cut point, we found
that studies with shorter follow-up reported a greater
risk reduction for all outcomes except cardiovascular
disease and coronary heart disease mortality (table 2).
Among those studies that used long term abstainers
as the referent category, excluding former drinkers or
evaluating them separately, the estimated association
between drinking and both incidence and mortality
estimates did not change substantively (table
2).
Among studies that evaluated former drinkers sepa-
rately, the risk of death (from cardiovascular disease
and coronary heart disease) was significantly higher
in former drinkers than in drinkers. However, former
drinkers did not have an increased risk of incident
cardiovascular events (coronary heart disease or
stroke).

consumption

Finally, a sensitivity analysis that excluded the few
studies where only odds ratios instead of relative risks
were presented had little effect on the results. In cumu-
lative meta-analyses of cardiovascular disease and cor-
onary heart disease outcomes (appendix figs 1–3 on
bmj.com), there was little variation in the relative risk
associated with alcohol consumption on cardiovascular
disease mortality or incident coronary heart disease
with addition of new studies after 1999; for coronary
heart disease mortality, this plateau in incremental
change from new studies occurred as early as 1992–3.

Mortality from all causes
Of the 84 studies addressing alcohol and cardio-
vascular disease events, 31 also examined the associa-
tion of alcohol consumption with all cause mortality.
The pooled estimates from these studies showed a
lower risk of all cause mortality for drinkers compared
with non-drinkers (relative risk 0.87 (0.83 to 0.92))
(fig 7). However, the association was J shaped, with
the lowest risk for those consuming 2.5–14.9 g/day

RESEARCH

(relative risk 0.83 (0.80 to 0.86), 16 studies) and an ele-
vated risk in those consuming >60 g/day (relative risk
1.30 (1.22 to 1.38), 8 studies).

Publication bias
Visual inspection of the funnel plot for each outcome
did not show asymmetry, an indication that significant
publication bias was not likely. This was further con-
firmed by a non-significant Begg’s test for each out-
come (for cardiovascular disease mortality, P=0.40;
incident coronary heart disease, P=0.75; coronary
heart disease mortality, P=0.089;
incident stroke,
P=0.33; stroke mortality, P=0.59; all cause mortality,
P=0.26).

DISCUSSION
In this review of 84 studies of alcohol consumption and
cardiovascular disease, alcohol consumption at 2.5–
14.9 g/day (about ≤1 drink a day) was consistently
associated with a 14–25% reduction in the risk of all
outcomes assessed compared with abstaining from
alcohol. Such a reduction in risk is potentially of clin-
ical importance, but consumption of larger amounts of
alcohol was associated with higher risks for stroke inci-
dence and mortality.

To our knowledge, this systematic review and meta-
analysis is the most comprehensive to date. Although
roughly similar estimates of lower risk were observed
in previous meta-analyses of both coronary heart dis-
ease and stroke,1-8 our review extends the findings by
assessing a broader array of relevant cardiovascular
outcomes and adding several new important studies.
Our review clarifies several discrepancies among
prior reports. Corrao et al reported a J shaped relation
between alcohol intake and coronary heart disease,2
whereas the review by Maclure described this relation
as L shaped because he did not observe an increase in
coronary heart disease risk associated with higher alco-
hol consumption.6 Our updated meta-analysis sup-
ports the latter association for coronary heart disease,
with a 25–35% risk reduction for light to moderate
drinking106 that also is present with heavier drinking.
Our analysis of multiple cardiovascular outcomes
also shows the complexities inherent in the study of
alcohol consumption. Modest alcohol intake was asso-
ciated with lower stroke incidence and mortality, but
the risk increased substantially with heavier drinking
(that is, a J shaped relation). Furthermore, the associa-
tion of alcohol consumption is complex and differs by
stroke subtype, with a slightly lower risk of ischaemic
stroke but higher risk of haemorrhagic stroke. These
differential associations probably reflect the known
antithrombotic effects of alcohol.107 Alcohol consump-
tion, particularly at high doses, also seems to have an
adverse association with blood pressure that may
account, in part, for the higher risk of haemorrhagic
stroke associated with heavier drinking.108 Addition-
ally, our analysis does not consider other known detri-
consumption.3
mental
Therefore, our findings lend further support for limits
on alcohol consumption.106 109

Our review also highlights other important aspects
of the relation between alcohol consumption and
cardiovascular disease. Firstly, the lower risk of coron-
ary heart disease associated with alcohol consumption
was at least as strong for women as for men. Limited
evidence suggests that the risk of stroke related to alco-
hol is lower for women than men, but this may only
reflect lower alcohol intake among women. Secondly,
inclusion of former drinkers did not seem to bias the
association of alcohol consumption with cardio-
vascular disease. Thirdly, when studies were sum-
marised chronologically, we found that the overall
association between drinking and cardiovascular dis-
ease and coronary heart disease became apparent at
least a decade ago, and ongoing studies have done little
to revise the estimated associations.

An argument for causation
From the extensive body of literature summarised
here, the association between alcohol consumption
and decreased cardiovascular risk is not in question,
as additional research has not changed this conclusion.
Rather, the lingering question is whether this associa-
tion is causal. Clearly, observational studies cannot
establish causation. However, when the present results
are coupled with those from our companion review
paper summarising interventional mechanistic studies

RESEARCH

focusing on biomarkers associated with cardiovascular
disease,110 the argument for causation becomes more
compelling. Indeed, the mechanistic biomarker review
shows biological plausibility for a causal association by
showing favourable changes in pathophysiologically
relevant molecules.

Therefore, we can now examine the argument for
causation based on Hill’s criteria.111 Beyond the biolo-
gical plausibility argument discussed above, there is an
appropriate temporal relation with alcohol use pre-
venting cardiovascular disease. Secondly, we have
observed a greater protective association with increas-
ing dose, except that it seems to be offset somewhat by
negative associations with the risk of haemorrhagic
stroke. Thirdly, the protective association of alcohol
has been consistently observed in diverse patient
populations and in both women and men. Fourthly,
the association is specific: moderate drinking (up to 1
drink or 12.5 g alcohol per day for women and 2 drinks
or 25 g alcohol per day for men106) is associated with
lower rates of cardiovascular disease but is not uni-
formly protective for other conditions,
such as
cancer.112 Lastly, the reduction in risk is notable even
when controlling for known confounders (such as
smoking, diet, and exercise). Any potential unmea-
sured confounder would need to be very strong to
explain away the apparently protective association.

The results of our meta-analysis should be interpreted
in context of the limitations of available data. Firstly,
the quality of individual studies varied, with some stu-
dies having limited follow-up and limited adjustment
for potential confounding. With respect to study fol-
low-up, it is possible that misclassification of alcohol
consumption may increase with study length because
of changes in drinking habits over time. It is also pos-
sible that potential biological effects of alcohol vary
with time of exposure. However, arguing against
both these possibilities, the analysis stratified by length
of
follow-up did not show different associations
between alcohol intake and outcome for shorter fol-
low-up times versus longer times.

risk estimates

Secondly, only a limited subset of studies provided
specific
for different beverages.
Although there is great interest in differences between
beer, wine, and spirits, alcoholic drinks generally have
similar
lipoprotein
cholesterol,113 and it is likely that any particular benefit
of wine is prone to confounding by diet and socioeco-
nomic status.114 115 None the less, this remains an inter-
esting topic for further investigation.

high

Thirdly, we found only limited information on the
relation between alcohol intake and mortality from
subtypes of stroke, so this topic continues to be impor-
tant for large observational cohort studies. Finally, we
observed significant heterogeneity across studies for
several of our pooled analyses. This may be due in
great part to large study sample sizes, which can confer
greater statistical power to heterogeneity tests, whereas
the clinical relevance of this heterogeneity may be

WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPIC:

Systematic reviews have addressed the association of alcohol consumption with various
cardiovascular outcomes

However, these reviews are somewhat out of date, and none has comprehensively studied a
broad spectrum of relevant cardiovascular end points

WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS

This meta-analysis provides a summary of current knowledge regarding alcohol associations
with six meaningful clinical end points—cardiovascular disease mortality, coronary heart
disease incidence and mortality, stroke incidence and mortality, and all cause mortality

The results confirm the beneficial effects of moderate alcohol consumption and the need to
elucidate the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms

quite modest.10 Visual inspection of our various forest
plots and the relative consistency of pooled relative
risks across clinical and methodological variables sug-
gest that there is considerable consistency in the rela-
tive risk findings across studies and across strata.

Implications
Given the consistency observed in our findings and
compelling mechanistic data pointing to causation in
our companion review, additional observational stu-
dies will have limited value except to elucidate more
precisely the association of alcohol and stroke.116
Rather, debate should centre now on how to integrate
this evidence into clinical practice and public health
messages. In the realm of clinical practice, the evidence
could form a foundation for proposing counselling for
selected patients to incorporate moderate amounts of
alcohol into their diets to improve their coronary heart
disease risk. However, such a clinical strategy requires
formal evaluation in pragmatic clinical trials that assess
the questions of optimal patient selection, compliance,
risks, and benefits. The focus of such trials would shift
from assessing the association between alcohol and dis-
ease outcomes to evaluating the receptivity of both
physicians and patients to the recommended con-
sumption of alcohol for therapeutic purposes and the
extent to which it can be successfully and safely imple-
mented. In support of implementation trials, our two
papers show that alcohol consumption in moderation
has reproducible and plausible effects on markers of
coronary heart disease risk.

With respect to public health messages, there may
now be an impetus to better communicate to the public
that alcohol, in moderation, may have overall health
benefits that outweigh the risks in selected subsets of
patients. Again, any such strategy would need to be
accompanied by rigorous study and oversight of
impacts. One approach would be to undertake public
health messaging pilot studies on well defined target
populations (such as a workplace or in a small jurisdic-
tion) to permit detailed evaluation of effects on mea-
sures such as knowledge, attitudes, self reported
drinking behaviours, and perhaps, secondarily, health
outcomes.

The debate on how to integrate this evidence into
clinical practice and public health messages will
require integration of all possible effects of alcohol—
from injury and violence to glucose metabolism and
inflammation—and recognition that these effects may
be distributed unequally across the population. For
example,
injury risk probably disproportionately
affects younger individuals, whereas cardiovascular
disease mainly affects older adults. Robust studies
that examine multiple outcomes simultaneously are
needed to identify those subsets of the population in
which reduced cardiovascular risk might dominate
against those for whom the risks of social and medical
problems (including several cancers and injury112 117)
are too great. Despite the latter concerns, results of
our secondary analysis of overall mortality (fig 5) sup-
port the notion that moderate alcohol consumption is
associated with net benefit, at least in populations simi-
lar to those studied in the extant literature.

Our two systematic review papers summarise a sur-
prisingly extensive body of literature on the relation
between alcohol and cardiovascular disease. Our find-
ings point to the need to define implications for clinical
and public health practice. These reviews and the per-
spectives above provide a foundation for that dialogue.

AHA Scientific Statement

Fish Consumption, Fish Oil, Omega-3 Fatty Acids, and

Cardiovascular Disease

Penny M. Kris-Etherton, PhD, RD; William S. Harris, PhD; Lawrence J. Appel, MD, MPH;

for the Nutrition Committee

Since the first AHA Science Advisory “Fish Consumption,

Fish Oil, Lipids, and Coronary Heart Disease,”1 impor-
tant new findings,
including evidence from randomized
controlled trials (RCTs), have been reported about the bene-
ficial effects of omega-3 (or n-3) fatty acids on cardiovascular
disease (CVD) in patients with preexisting CVD as well as in
healthy individuals.2 New information about how omega-3
fatty acids affect cardiac function (including antiarrhythmic
effects), hemodynamics (cardiac mechanics), and arterial
endothelial function have helped clarify potential mecha-
nisms of action. The present Statement will address distinc-
tions between plant-derived (␣-linolenic acid, C18:3n-3) and
marine-derived (eicosapentaenoic acid, C20:5n-3 [EPA] and
docosahexaenoic acid, C22:6n-3 [DHA]) omega-3 fatty ac-
ids. (Unless otherwise noted, the term omega-3 fatty acids
will refer to the latter.) Evidence from epidemiological
studies and RCTs will be reviewed, and recommendations
reflecting the current state of knowledge will be made with
regard to both fish consumption and omega-3 fatty acid
(plant- and marine-derived) supplementation. This will be
done in the context of recent guidance issued by the US
Environmental Protection Agency and the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) about the presence of environmental
contaminants in certain species of fish.

Epidemiological and Observational Studies

Coronary Heart Disease
As reviewed by Stone,1 three prospective epidemiological
studies within populations reported that men who ate at least
some fish weekly had a lower coronary heart disease (CHD)
mortality rate than that of men who ate none.3– 6 More recent
evidence that fish consumption favorably affects CHD mor-
tality, especially nonsudden death from myocardial infarction
(MI), has been reported in a 30-year follow-up of the Chicago
Western Electric Study.7 Men who consumed 35 g or more of
fish daily compared with those who consumed none had a
relative risk of death from CHD of 0.62 and a relative risk of

nonsudden death from MI of 0.33. In an ecological study
conducted by Zhang et al,8 fish consumption was associated
with a reduced risk from all-cause, ischemic heart disease and
stroke mortality across 36 countries. In addition, in a study of
Japanese living in Japan or Brazil, Mizushima et al9 reported
a dose-response relationship between the frequency of
weekly fish intake and reduced CVD risk factors (eg, obesity,
hypertension, glycohemoglobin, ST-T segment change on the
ECG). Until recently, little information was available about
the effects of fish and omega-3 fatty acids and risk of CHD in
women. A recent study conducted with women in the Nurses’
Health Study10 reported an inverse association between fish
intake and omega-3 fatty acids and CHD death. Compared
with women who rarely ate fish (less than once per month),
the risk for CHD death was 21%, 29%, 31%, and 34% lower
for fish consumption 1 to 3 times per month, once per week,
2 to 4 times per week, and ⬎5 times per week, respectively
(P for trend⫽0.001). Comparing the extreme quintiles of fish
intake, the reduction in risk for CHD deaths seemed to be
stronger for CHD death than for nonfatal MI (RR 0.55 versus
0.73).

Some studies have not reported a beneficial association of
fish consumption and CHD mortality. In the Health Profes-
sionals’ Follow-up Study,11 no significant association was
observed between fish intake (and omega-3 fatty acids) and
risk of any CHD (ie, fatal coronary disease including sudden
death, nonfatal MI, coronary artery bypass grafting, or angio-
plasty). Likewise, the US Physicians’ Health Study did not
show an association between fish consumption (or omega-3
fatty acid intake) and reduced risk of total MI, nonsudden
cardiac death, or total cardiovascular mortality.12 In contrast,
however, fish consumption was related to a reduced risk of
total mortality. The lack of an association between fish intake
and CHD incidence and mortality also was reported from an
analysis of the Seven Countries data and the EURAMIC
(European Multicenter Case-Control Study on Antioxidants,
Myocardial Infarction and Breast Cancer) Study.13,14 In the

Seven Countries Study, although an inverse association
between fish consumption and 25-year mortality from CHD
across several populations was observed,13 when the con-
founding effects of saturated fatty acids, flavonoids, and
smoking were considered, the association was not significant.
In the EURAMIC Study, a large international case-control
study, no evidence of a protective effect of adipose tissue
DHA (a measure of long-term fish consumption) on the risk
of developing MI was seen.14

Some investigators have speculated that the conflicting
data from the epidemiological studies reflect differences in
definitions of sudden death and the residual confounding of
reference groups that had a less healthy lifestyle,15 variability
in the end points studied, experimental design or how fish
intake was estimated, different study populations,16 and the
possible confounding effect of an increase in hemorrhagic
stroke. Albert et al12 proposed that their lack of an association
may have been due to the small fraction of their study
population (3.1%) reporting little to no fish consumption.
Only studies including sizable non–fish-eating populations
have reported an inverse association between fish consump-
tion and coronary mortality. In the EURAMIC Study, only
survivors of MI were evaluated, and it is conceivable that
individuals who did not survive ate less fish. Another expla-
nation, based on a rigorous analysis of 11 prospective cohort
studies, is that the protective effect of fish consumption
relates to the CHD risk status of the population studied17; this
analysis concluded that fish consumption reduced CHD
mortality (RR⫽0.4 to 0.6) in high-risk but not
low-risk
populations. Another consideration relates to the type of fish
consumed (ie, fatty versus lean fish). Oomen et al18 reported
a lower CHD mortality (RR⫽0.66) in populations that
consumed fatty fish but not lean fish.

Finally, another explanation for the discordant results of
epidemiological studies pertains to the hypothesized adverse
effects of methylmercury, an environmental contaminant
found in certain fish that may diminish the health benefits of
omega-3 fatty acids.19 Recent studies have produced conflict-
ing results with regard to the effects of methylmercury on
CHD risk.20,21 Thus, the extent to which methylmercury in
fish may mask the beneficial effects of omega-3 fatty acids
requires further study.

Fish consumption has been shown to be related to reduced
sudden cardiac death. In a population-based, nested, case-
control study, a strong negative relationship was reported
between fish intake and risk for sudden death (ie, 5.5 g of
omega-3 fatty acids per month, equivalent to two fatty fish
meals per week, was associated with a 50% reduced risk of
primary cardiac arrest).22 In the US Physicians’ Health Study,
men who consumed fish at least once weekly had a relative
risk of sudden death of 0.48 (P⫽0.04) versus men who
consumed fish less than once per month.12 A recent report
from the Physicians’ Health Study23 reported an inverse
relationship between blood levels of long-chain omega-3
fatty acids and risk of sudden death in men without a history
of CVD. The relative risk of sudden death was significantly
lower among men with levels in the third quartile (RR⫽0.28)
and the fourth quartile (RR⫽0.19) compared with men whose
blood levels were in the first quartile.

Further evidence for a protective effect of omega-3 fatty
acids comes from two recent studies by Landmark et al24,25
who reported that chronic intake of fish or fish oil was
associated with a reduction in infarct size as estimated by the
frequency of Q-wave infarcts and by peak creatine kinase and
lactate dehydrogenase activities after MI. In contrast to all the
studies demonstrating a beneficial association, the Alpha-
Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention Study found
that estimated omega-3 fatty acid intake from fish was
associated with a trend toward increased relative risk of
coronary death after adjustment for trans, saturated, and
cis-monounsaturated fatty acids.26

A growing body of evidence from recent epidemiological
studies indicates that ␣-linolenic acid is associated with a
lower risk of MI and fatal ischemic heart disease in women
and in men. In the EURAMIC Study, Guallar et al14 com-
pared the highest quintile of adipose tissue ␣-linolenic acid to
the lowest and found a relative risk for MI of 0.42 (P for
trend⫽0.02). This became nonsignificant after adjusting for
classic risk factors (primarily smoking). Using a food-
frequency questionnaire from a 10-year follow-up of the
Nurses’ Health Study, and after controlling for standard
coronary risk factors, Hu et al27 reported a dose-response
relationship between ␣-linolenic acid intake and relative risk
of fatal ischemic heart disease, which was reduced by 45% in
the highest quintile (P for trend⫽0.01). Similar findings were
reported with the same methodology in the all-male Health
Professionals’ Study, in which a 1% increase in ␣-linolenic
acid intake was associated with a 0.41 relative risk for acute
MI (P for trend⫽0.01).28 Lowest-quintile intakes of ␣-linole-
nic acid in these latter two trials were 0.7 to 0.8 g/d, and
highest quintile intakes, 1.4 to 1.5 g/d. In the National Heart,
Lung, and Blood Institute Family Heart Study, a cross-
sectional study with 4584 participants, ␣-linolenic acid was
inversely related to coronary artery disease.29 The prevalence
odds ratio of coronary artery disease was reduced ⬇40% for
men in the top three quintiles of ␣-linolenic acid intake and
⬇50% to 70% for women. In contrast, in the Zutphen Elderly
Study, a prospective epidemiological study with 667 men,
ages 64 to 84 years,
there was no beneficial effect of
␣-linolenic acid intake on risk of 10-year coronary artery
disease incidence.30 In the latter study, however, these nega-
tive results have been explained by the association between
␣-linolenic acid and trans-fatty acid intake,30 as well as by
limitations in the collection of the dietary data.31 Despite this
latter study, a growing epidemiological database demon-
strates a protective effect of ␣-linolenic acid on coronary
disease. Nonetheless,
intervention studies are needed to
establish a causal relationship between ␣-linolenic acid intake
and coronary disease.

Stroke
Compared with the literature describing the effects of
omega-3 fatty acids on CHD, relatively little information
about the association of omega-3 fatty acids and cerebral
infarctions (stroke) is available. Several epidemiological
studies have examined the relationship between fish intake
and stroke incidence. In the Zutphen Study, the unadjusted
hazard ratio of men who consumed an average of 20 g/d of

fish was 0.49 (P⬍0.05) compared with those who consumed
less.32 Likewise, in the National Health and Nutrition Exam-
ination Survey (NHANES) Epidemiologic Follow-up Study,
white females who consumed fish more than once per week
had an age-adjusted stroke incidence that was only half that of
women who reported not consuming fish.33 A similar protec-
tive effect was seen in both black women and men but not in
white men. A trend (P⫽0.06) toward reduced risk for stroke
with increasing reported fish consumption was also reported
in the Nurses’ Health Study.34 In contrast, both the Chicago
Western Electric Study35 and the Physicians’ Health Study36
failed to find any relationship between reported fish intake
and reduced stroke risk.

According to the serum fatty acid profiles of subjects in the
Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial, ␣-linolenic acid was
negatively associated with stroke incidence.37 In both the
Lyon Diet Heart Study38 (testing a Mediterranean-style diet
enriched with ␣-linolenic acid) and the GISSI-Prevention
Study39 (testing the effects of 850 mg of supplemental
omega-3 fatty acids), there was no significant effect on the
incidence of stroke.

The evidence to date is primarily for total stroke risk, and
associations could differ if the data were analyzed for
type-specific stroke incidence. For example, evidence exists
for an inverse relationship between small intakes of fish (1
portion per week) and ischemic stroke32 and for a possible
increased risk for hemorrhagic stroke with “Eskimo” intakes
of omega-3 fatty acids.40 Thus, as Zhang et al8 have noted,
linking fish consumption with total stroke risk is likely to
underestimate the strength of the real associations between
fish consumption and type-specific stroke risk.

Randomized Controlled Trials

At the time of the first Advisory, the only RCT of omega-3
fatty acids in secondary prevention of CHD was the Diet And
Reinfarction Trial (DART), which reported a 29% reduction
in all-cause mortality over a 2-year period in male MI
survivors advised to increase their intake of oily fish (200 to
400 g of fatty fish per week, which provided an additional
500 to 800 mg/d of omega-3 fatty acids).41 The greatest
benefit was seen in fatal MIs, and this observation led to the
hypothesis that omega-3 fatty acids might protect the myo-
cardium against the adverse sequela of acute ischemic stress.
A post hoc analysis of patients receiving fish oil capsules
(900 mg/d of EPA⫹DHA) in DART suggested that
the
protective effect was attributable to omega-3 fatty acids.42

The first of three recent RCTs designed to detect the effects
of supplemental EPA and DHA on clinical events was
reported by Singh et al.43 Patients admitted to the hospital
with suspected acute MIs were randomized to either fish oil
capsules (containing 1.8 g/d of EPA⫹DHA), mustard oil (20
g/d providing 2.9 g ␣-linolenic acid), or placebo. After one
year, total cardiac events were 25% and 28% in the fish oil
and mustard oil groups, respectively, versus 35% in the
placebo group (P⬍0.01). As in the DART, nonfatal MIs were
significantly lower in the fish oil and mustard oil groups.

The largest prospective RCT to test

the efficacy of
omega-3 fatty acids for secondary prevention of CHD is the
GISSI-Prevention Study.39 In this study, 11 324 patients with

preexisting CHD (who were receiving conventional cardiac
pharmacotherapy) were randomized to either 300 mg of
vitamin E, 850 mg of omega-3 fatty acid ethyl esters (as EPA
and DHA), both, or neither. After 3.5 years of follow-up, the
group given the omega-3 fatty acids alone experienced a 15%
reduction in the primary end point of death, nonfatal MI, and
nonfatal stroke (P⬍0.02). There was a 20% reduction in
all-cause mortality (P⫽0.01) and a 45% reduction in sudden
death (P⬍0.001) compared with the control group; vitamin E
provided no additional benefit. Triglycerides decreased by
4% and LDL cholesterol levels increased by 2.5% after six
months in the omega-3 fatty acid treatment groups compared
with controls. This trial, although very large and carried out
in a relatively “usual-care” setting, was not placebo con-
trolled, and dropout rates were high (⬎25%). A follow-up
study44 assessed the time-course of the benefit of omega-3
fatty acids on mortality in subjects in the GISSI Study and
found that survival curves diverged early after randomization.
Total mortality was significantly lowered after 3 months of
treatment (RR⫽0.59), and by 4 months, risk of sudden death
was reduced (RR⫽0.47).

In contrast to the growing body of evidence supporting a
protective effect of omega-3 fatty acids in secondary preven-
tion, a recent study reported no effect of 3.5 g/d of
DHA⫹EPA versus corn oil on cardiac events in post-MI
patients (n⫽300) after 1.5 years of intervention.45 The au-
thors speculated that the lack of an omega-3 fatty acid effect
may have been due to the high habitual fish intake in western
Norway, which could have afforded maximal protection
beyond which no additional effects would be expected. Thus,
further research is needed to confirm and further define the
role of omega-3 fatty acid supplements for secondary preven-
tion of coronary disease.

The first study to explore the effects of omega-3 fatty acids
on angiographic progression rates provided 59 patients either
6 g/d of omega-3 fatty acids or olive oil for 2 years.46 No
benefit was observed. More recently, a larger trial using
lower and more practical intakes of omega-3 fatty acids has
been reported.47 Patients presenting for coronary angiography
(n⫽223) were randomized to either placebo or omega-3 fatty
acids (3 g/d for 3 months followed by 1.5 g/d for 21 months).
The latter group exhibited significantly (P⫽0.04) less pro-
gression, more regression, and a trend toward fewer clinical
events (7 versus 2, P⫽0.1). Finally, Eritsland et al48 reported
that
in 610 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass
grafting, the provision of 3.4 g of omega-3 fatty acid ethyl
esters lowered vein graft occlusion rates from 33% (control)
to 27% (P⫽0.03).

Several randomized trials of fish oil were conducted over
the past 10 years to test the hypothesis that omega-3 fatty
acids could prevent restenosis after percutaneous translumi-
nal coronary angioplasty. Although a meta-analysis of seven
early trials concluded that supplementation was beneficial,49
more recent trials (with large study populations given 5 to 7
g/d of omega-3 fatty acids) have not supported this conclu-
sion.50,51 Most investigators have concluded that further trials
are not warranted.

The question of the efficacy of ␣-linolenic acid in CHD
prevention has been examined in four trials. The Indian

Experiment of Infarct Survival43 discussed above reported a
significant decrease in total cardiac events in the group
assigned to mustard seed oil. The Lyon Heart Trial was a
secondary prevention trial designed to test whether a
Mediterranean-type diet (including increased amounts of
␣-linolenic acid) would reduce reoccurrence rates of cardiac
events compared with a prudent Western diet.38,52 Marked
reductions were seen in cardiac death and nonfatal MI, major
secondary end points, and minor events. The difference in
intakes of ␣-linolenic acid between groups was 0.5 versus 1.5
g/d. It is impossible, however, to ascribe the benefit unam-
biguously to ␣-linolenic acid because many other dietary
variables were present: Saturated fat and cholesterol de-
creased and monounsaturated fat increased, as did the con-
sumption of fruits and vegetables.

Although the Indian Experiment of Infarct Survival43 and
the Lyon Heart Trial38 provide clinical
trial evidence in
support of a beneficial effect of ␣-linolenic acid, the Norwe-
gian Vegetable Oil Experiment53 and the Mediterranean
Alpha-Linolenic Enriched Groningen Dietary Intervention
(MARGARIN) Study54 do not. The Norwegian Vegetable Oil
Experiment was a double-blind RCT in which ⬎13 000 men
ages 50 to 59 with no history of MI were randomized to
consume 5.5 g/d of ␣-linolenic acid (from 10 mL of linseed
oil) or 10 mL of sunflower seed oil for one year. There were
27 cases of new CHD or sudden death in each group, and 40
versus 43 deaths from any cause in the control versus the
linseed oil groups. In the MARGARIN Study, free-living
subjects (n⫽124 men and 158 women) with multiple CVD
risk factors were provided with margarines high in either
␣-linolenic acid or linoleic acid and followed up for 2 years.54
According to effects on CVD risk factors,
the 10-year
estimated ischemic heart disease risk decreased similarly in
both groups (2.1% and 2.5%, respectively). Of note, however,
was a trend toward fewer CVD events in the ␣-linolenic acid
group (1.8% versus 5.7%, P⫽0.20). It

olenic acid in reducing CHD risk.

is important

In aggregate, available RCTs show a beneficial effect of
dietary and supplemental omega-3 fatty acids, including both
EPA⫹DHA and ␣-linolenic acid, on CHD. This has been
summarized in a recent meta-analysis of 11 RCTs with 7951
patients in the intervention groups.55 In this meta-analysis, the
risk ratio of nonfatal MI was 0.8, for fatal MI it was 0.7, and
for sudden death (in 5 trials) it was 0.7.

Possible Mechanisms

The mechanisms responsible for the observed effects of
omega-3 fatty acids on cardiovascular health are not known
with confidence, especially at the low intakes utilized in the
DART and GISSI Prevention Study. Those possibly involved
are summarized in Table 1.56

Triglycerides
The hypotriglyceridemic effects of omega-3 fatty acids from
fish oils are well established. In a comprehensive review of
human studies, Harris57 reported that ⬇4 g/d of omega-3 fatty
acids from fish oil decreased serum triglyceride concentra-
tions by 25% to 30%, with accompanying increases in LDL

cholesterol of 5% to 10% and in HDL cholesterol of 1% to
3%. A dose-response relationship exists between omega-3
fatty acid intake and triglyceride lowering.57 Postprandial
triglyceridemia is especially sensitive to chronic omega-3
fatty acid consumption,58,59 with quite small intakes (⬍2 g/d)
producing significant reductions.60 The plasma lipid and
lipoprotein responses to fish oil are comparable in diabetic
and nondiabetic subjects.61 In addition, a recent meta-analysis
of 26 trials of subjects with type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus
reported no effects of fish oil on hemoglobin A1c,62 although
fasting blood glucose levels rose slightly in the latter group.
Fish oil can have a therapeutic role in the treatment of
marked hypertriglyceridemia (⬎750 mg/dL). Effective doses
of omega-3 fatty acids range from 3 to 5 g/d, which can only
be obtained consistently by supplementation. At present, it
seems that both EPA and DHA have triglyceride-lowering
properties.63 Patients taking ⬎3 g of EPA⫹DHA from
supplements should do so only under a physician’s care
because the FDA has noted that an intake in excess of this
level could result in excessive bleeding in some individuals.64
In contrast, cardioprotective intakes seem to be considerably
lower (⬇1 g/d), have almost no potential for adverse effects,
and can be achieved by diet.

Blood Pressure
Omega-3 fatty acids seem to have a small, dose-dependent,
hypotensive effect, the extent of which seems to be dependent
on the degree of hypertension.65 In a meta-analysis, Morris et
al66 found a significant reduction in blood pressure of
⫺3.4/⫺2.0 mm Hg in studies with hypertensive subjects who
consumed 5.6 g/d of omega-3 fatty acids. Likewise, Appel et
found that blood pressure was decreased ⫺5.5/
al67
⫺3.5 mm Hg in trials of untreated hypertensives given ⬎3
g/d of omega-3 fatty acids. DHA seems to be more effective
than EPA in lowering blood pressure.68 Still, in view of the
high dose required to lower blood pressure and the proven
efficacy of other nutritional factors and of antihypertensive
medications, an increased intake of omega-3 fatty acids has a
limited role in the management of hypertension.

Thrombosis and Hemostasis
Omega-3 fatty acids decrease platelet aggregation,69,70 result-
ing in a modest prolongation of bleeding times (reviewed by
Knapp71). Some evidence indicates that fish oil supplemen-

tation may enhance fibrinolysis.72 Although omega-3 fatty
acid intake has been negatively associated with levels of
fibrinogen, Factor VIII, and von Willebrand factor,73 more
recent evidence from the Coronary Artery Risk Development
In young Adults (CARDIA) study found no significant
associations between customary intakes of fish (4 to 39 g/d)
and omega-3 fatty acids (0.9 to 4.1 g/d) and these coagulation
factors.74 Marckmann et al75 also found no effect of omega-3
fatty acids (0.9 g/d) on levels of Factor VII, fibrinogen,
endogenous fibrinolysis, ␤-thromboglobulin, and von Wille-
brand factor. In contrast, a recent study reported that coronary
patients taking 5.1 g/d of omega-3 fatty acids for 6 months
experienced a reduction in von Willebrand factor (128%
versus 147% for controls) and thrombomodulin (25 versus 33
ng/mL).76 Although it seems clear that omega-3 fatty acids
beneficially influence collagen-induced platelet aggregation
(thereby affecting hemostasis), their effects on thrombosis
remain unclear. There is little evidence to suggest that an
intake ⬍3 g/d of omega-3 fatty acids would cause clinically
significant bleeding.

Arrhythmias
The possibility that omega-3 fatty acids (including ␣-linole-
nic acid) may reduce risk for sudden cardiac death is based on
evidence from a prospective cohort study,12 a case-control
study,22 and four prospective dietary intervention tri-
als.38,39,41,43 Proposed mechanisms to explain these observa-
tions center not on lipid or blood pressure lowering or on
antithrombotic effects, but on a novel stabilizing effect of
omega-3 fatty acids on the myocardium itself. Evidence for a
direct effect of these fatty acids on the heart has come from
several observations. First, increased heart rate variability in
survivors of MI was associated with the consumption of one
fish meal per week77 or fish oil supplements (4.3 g/d of
omega-3 fatty acids).78 Increases in this parameter predict a
lower risk of mortality due to arrhythmic events in post-MI
patients. EPA and DHA also have been shown to reduce
resting heart rate and increase left ventricular filling capaci-
ty.79 Animal experiments and cell culture studies have shown
that fish oil has potent antiarrhythmic effects. For example,
studies with rats80 and dogs81,82 have shown that pretreatment
with omega-3 fatty acids reduced damage to cardiac tissue
and forestalled the development of ventricular dysrhythmias
when heart attacks were induced. Similar observations were
made in fish oil–fed cats that were protected from cerebral
damage after stroke induction.83 In vitro induction of
tachyarrhythmias in cultured neonatal rat ventricular myo-
cytes by various pharmacological agents (such as ouabain)
can be prevented or abolished by the addition of omega-3
fatty acids to the culture medium (reviewed by Kang and
Leaf84). This seems to be due to the ability of omega-3 fatty
acids to prevent calcium overload by maintaining the activity
of L-type calcium channels during periods of stress,85 and to
increase the activity of cardiac microsomal Ca2⫹/Mg2⫹-
ATPase.79 In addition, omega-3 fatty acids (including ␣-lin-
olenic acid) are potent inhibitors of voltage-gated sodium
channels in cultured neonatal cardiac myocytes, which may
contribute to the reduction in arrhythmia.84

Other Biological Effects
Goode et al86 showed that acetylcholine-stimulated relaxation
of small arteries taken from hypercholesterolemic patients
was significantly improved after three months of supplemen-
tation with 3 g/d of EPA⫹DHA. Fish oil feeding has also
been shown to improve endothelial function (reviewed by
Chin and Dart87) and to increase arterial compliance.88 These
effects may be secondary to fish oil’s ability to enhance nitric
oxide production89 and may be the mechanism by which fish
oil elicits a small hypotensive effect.

Mechanisms to explain the antiatherogenic (inhibition of
new plaque development) effect of omega-3 fatty acids have
recently been proposed.48 For example, EPA and DHA seem
to alter the metabolism of adhesion molecules such as
vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), E-selectin, and
intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1). Abe et al
(1998)90 reported a 9% reduction in soluble ICAM-1 and a
16% reduction in soluble E-selectin but not
in soluble
VCAM-1 in hypertriglyceridemic subjects receiving 3.4 g/d
of highly purified omega-3 fatty acid ethyl esters for 7 to 12
months. There is also in vitro evidence that DHA reduces
endothelial expression of VCAM-1 and the expression of
E-selectin, ICAM-1, interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-8 in stimu-
lated cells.91,92 On the other hand, a study in male smokers
with hyperlipidemia showed that six weeks of omega-3 fatty
acid supplementation (4.8 g/d) increased soluble forms of
E-selectin and VCAM-1.93 A subsequent study in coronary
patients given supplemental omega-3 fatty acids (5.1 g/d for
6 months) found similar results.76 Fish oil also affects the
metabolism of inflammatory mediators like the interleukins
and tumor necrosis factor-␣,94 molecules also believed to play
a role in atherogenesis and plaque stability.95

Another potential antiatherogenic mechanism of omega-3
fatty acids is their interference with the arachidonic acid
cascade that generates a wide variety of eicosanoids (re-
viewed by Uauy et al96). EPA not only can replace arachi-
donic acid in phospholipid bilayers, but it is also a competi-
tive inhibitor of cyclooxygenase, reducing the production of
the 2-series prostaglandins, thromboxanes, and prostacyclins
and the 4-series leukotrienes. The 3- and 5-series (respective-
ly) produced from EPA are generally less biologically active.
DHA, although not a direct inhibitor of arachidonic acid
metabolism, nevertheless can inhibit platelet aggregation by
reducing the affinity of platelet TxA2/PGH2 receptor for its
ligand.97 The net effects of omega-3 fatty acids are thus to
reduce inflammatory processes, vasoconstriction, and platelet
aggregation, all known to be antiatherogenic.

Some studies have shown that omega-3 fatty acids may
increase the susceptibility of LDL to oxidation,98,99 whereas
others have not.100 –102 It therefore remains to be established
whether LDL oxidative status in vivo is affected by omega-3
fatty acids and, if so, whether this has any adverse clinical
implications. Our current inability to identify and quantify in
vivo oxidative damage and to relate it to clinical outcomes
makes it difficult to draw firm conclusions about the impact
of omega-3 fatty acids on these processes.

acid accounts for ⬇1.4 g/d, and only 0.1 to 0.2 g/d comes
from EPA and DHA. The major food sources of ␣-linolenic
acid are vegetable oils, principally canola and soybean oils.
Other food sources that are rich in ␣-linolenic acid (Table
2)104 include flaxseed (23 g/100 g) and English walnuts (7
g/100 g). Although some ␣-linolenic acid is converted to the
longer-chain omega-3 fatty acids, the extent of this conver-
sion is modest and controversial. For example, Emken et al105
reported a 15% conversion, whereas Pawlosky et al106 found
0.2%; both reported that the conversion to DHA was much
less than that to EPA. Fish are the major food source of EPA
and DHA (Table 3).104 All fish contain EPA and DHA;
however, the quantities vary among species and within a
species according to environmental variables such as diet and
whether fish are wild or farm-raised. Farm-raised catfish tend
to have less EPA and DHA than do wild catfish, whereas
farm-raised salmon and trout contain similar amounts versus
their wild counterparts.

A number of countries (Canada, Sweden, United Kingdom,
Australia, Japan) as well as the World Health Organization
and North Atlantic Treaty Organisation have made formal
population-based dietary recommendations for omega-3 fatty
acids. Typical
recommendations are 0.3 to 0.5 g/d of
EPA⫹DHA and 0.8 to 1.1 g/d of ␣-linolenic acid. Recently,
the Food and Nutrition Board, Institute of Medicine, and The
National Academies, in collaboration with Health Canada,
released the Dietary Reference Intakes for Energy and Ma-
cronutrients.107 The Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution
Range (AMDR) for ␣-linolenic acid is estimated to be 0.6%
to 1.2% of energy, or 1.3 to 2.7 g/d on the basis of a
2000-calorie diet. This is ⬇10 times the current intake of
EPA⫹DHA. The lower boundary of the range is based on an
Adequate Intake set for ␣-linolenic acid, which represents
median intake levels that prevent an essential fatty acid
deficiency. The upper boundary corresponds to the highest
␣-linolenic acid intakes from foods consumed by individuals
in the United States and Canada. Thus, the intent of the
AMDR range for omega-3 fatty acids is to provide guidance
for healthy people, not to prevent chronic disease. These
recommendations can easily be met by following the AHA
Dietary Guidelines to consume two fish meals per week, with
an emphasis on fatty fish (ie, salmon, herring, and mackerel),
and by using liquid vegetable oils containing ␣-linolenic acid.
Commercially prepared fried fish (eg, from restaurants and

fast
food establishments, as well as many frozen,
convenience-type fried fish products) should be avoided
because they are low in omega-3 and high in trans-fatty acids.
Patients with CHD should be encouraged to increase their
consumption of EPA and DHA to ⬇1 g/d, which is the dose
used in the GISSI-Prevention Study. Table 3 presents
omega-3 fatty acid content of various fish and supplements as
well as the amount required each day to provide ⬇1 g/d of
EPA⫹DHA. Although this level of EPA and DHA intake
potentially can be attained through fish consumption, the
requisite amount of fish intake may be difficult to achieve and
sustain over the long term. For those individuals who do not
eat fish, have limited access to a variety of fish, or cannot
afford to purchase fish, a fish oil supplement may be
considered. Depending on the preparation, up to three 1-g fish
oil capsules per day will be necessary to provide ⬇1 g/d of
omega-3 fatty acids. The most common fish oil capsules in
the United States today provide 180 mg of EPA and 120 mg
DHA per capsule. It is important that consumers read the
nutrition label to determine EPA and DHA levels in the fish
oil capsule.

Safety of Omega-3 Fatty Acids

Omega-3 fatty acids have been a part of the human diet for
millennia. It has been estimated that the ratio of omega-6 to
omega-3 fatty acids in the diet of early humans was 1:1.108
The ratio in the United States today has risen to ⬇10:1
because of the combination of reduced omega-3 fatty acid
intake and the widespread use of vegetable oils rich in
linoleic acid.103 Because of the well-known competition
between the omega-6 linoleate and the omega-3 ␣-linolenate
for metabolic conversion to longer-chain, physiologically
active metabolites, reducing the former while increasing the
latter (or simply increasing the latter) is a strategy for
increasing tissue levels of omega-3 fatty acids.109 Another
obvious strategy is to simply consume more EPA and DHA,
an approach that minimizes the significance of the ratio.

Since the first omega-3 fatty acid advisory,1 the FDA has
ruled that intakes of up to 3 g/d of marine omega-3 fatty acids
are GRAS (Generally Recognized As Safe) for inclusion in
the diet.110 This ruling included specific consideration of the
reported effects of omega-3 fatty acids on glycemic control in
patients with diabetes, on bleeding tendencies, and on LDL
cholesterol. Moreover, the FDA recently has approved a
qualified health claim for EPA and DHA omega-3 fatty acids
in dietary supplements.64

Although the safety of low intakes does not seem to be an
issue, and supplements are essentially mercury free, some
side effects of omega-3 fatty acid supplementation do occur
(Table 4).111 Perhaps the most common is a fishy aftertaste. In
the GISSI Prevention study, which provided 0.85 g of
omega-3 fatty acids per day for 3.5 years, 3.8% of patients
discontinued taking their supplements (compared with 2.1%
for the vitamin E group). Gastrointestinal disturbances and
nausea were the most commonly reported side effects, with
4.9% and 1.4% reported, respectively, compared with 2.9%
and 0.4% in the vitamin E group. When 12 capsules contain-

ing 6 g of omega-3 fatty acids were fed to 41 patients for 2.4
years, three patients dropped from the study claiming intol-
erance to the capsules.46 In a 6-month trial providing 275
patients with 6.9 g of EPA⫹DHA in 10 capsules daily, there
was no difference between the fish oil and corn oil control
groups for any adverse event.112 Gastrointestinal upset was
reported by 8% of the latter and 7% of the former. Finally,
although refined and concentrated omega-3 fatty acid prod-
ucts contain virtually no methylmercury and are very low in
organochloride contaminants,113 less well-controlled prepara-
tions can contain appreciable amounts.114

Safety of Fish

Some species of fish may contain significant
levels of
methylmercury, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), dioxins,
and other environmental contaminants. These substances are
present at low levels in fresh waters and oceans, and they
bioconcentrate in the aquatic food chain such that levels are
generally highest in older, larger, predatory fish and marine
mammals.

Fish and seafood are a major source of human exposure to
these contaminants. PCBs and methylmercury have long
half-lives in the body and can accumulate in people who
consume contaminated fish on a frequent basis. Consumers
can reduce their exposure to PCBs by removing the skin and
fat from these fish before cooking them; however, because
methylmercury is distributed throughout the muscle, skinning
and trimming does not significantly reduce mercury concen-
trations in filets.

The responsibility for regulating the quality of the fish for
human consumption is shared by the states and two federal
agencies. The Environmental Protection Agency regulates
sport-caught fish, whereas the FDA regulates all commercial
fish—including farm-raised, imported, and marine fish. The
Environmental Protection Agency’s 2000 National Listing of
Fish and Wildlife Advisories may be found on the Environ-
mental Protection Agency web site.115 The Environmental
Protection Agency advises women who are pregnant or may
become pregnant and nursing mothers to limit their consump-
tion of sport-caught fish to one 6-ounce meal per week.116
The Environmental Protection Agency also recommends that
young children consume ⱕ2 ounces of sport-caught fish per
week. The FDA recommends that women who are pregnant
or nursing and young children eliminate shark, swordfish,
king mackerel
in the mackerel family, and tilefish (also
referred to as golden bass or golden snapper) from their diets
completely and limit their consumption of other fish to 12
ounces per week (⬇3 to 4 servings/wk) to minimize exposure
to methylmercury.117 The FDA has concluded that persons
other than pregnant women and women who may become

pregnant can consume up to 7 ounces per week of fish with
methylmercury levels around 1 ppm (eg, shark, swordfish,
king mackerel, tilefish) and 14 ounces per week of fish with
mercury levels averaging 0.5 ppm (eg, fresh tuna, orange
roughy, marlin, red snapper).118 In July 2002, an FDA
Scientific Committee advised the FDA to conduct a more
detailed analysis of the contribution of methylmercury from
tuna (with emphasis on large tuna consumed as steaks rather
than canned tuna) to total methylmercury levels in women
and children. Although more data are needed, information
currently available about the methylmercury content of se-
lected fish can be found on the FDA web site.119

In summary, consumers need to be aware of both the
benefits and risks of fish consumption for their particular
stage of life. Children and pregnant and lactating women may
increased risk for mercury intoxication from fish
be at
consumption but also are at
low risk for CHD. Thus,
avoidance of potentially contaminated fish is a higher priority
for this group. For middle-aged and older men and postmeno-
pausal women, the benefits of fish consumption far outweigh
the risks within the guidelines established by the FDA and
Environmental Protection Agency. Consumption of a wide
variety of species within the guidelines is the best approach to
both minimizing mercury exposure and increasing omega-3
fatty acid intake.

Summary

Omega-3 fatty acids have been shown in epidemiological and
clinical trials to reduce the incidence of CVD. Large-scale
epidemiological studies suggest that individuals at risk for
CHD benefit from the consumption of plant- and marine-
derived omega-3 fatty acids, although the ideal
intakes
presently are unclear. Evidence from prospective secondary
prevention studies suggests that EPA⫹DHA supplementation
ranging from 0.5 to 1.8 g/d (either as fatty fish or supple-
ments) significantly reduces subsequent cardiac and all-cause
mortality. For ␣-linolenic acid, total intakes of ⬇1.5 to 3 g/d
seem to be beneficial.

Collectively, these data are supportive of the recommen-
dation made by the AHA Dietary Guidelines to include at
least two servings of fish per week (particularly fatty fish). In
addition, the data support inclusion of vegetable oils (eg,
soybean, canola, walnut, flaxseed) and food sources (eg,
walnuts, flaxseeds) high in ␣-linolenic acid in a healthy diet
for the general population (Table 5). The fish recommenda-
tion must be balanced with concerns about environmental
pollutants, in particular PCB and methylmercury, described
in state and federal advisories. Consumption of a variety of
fish is recommended to minimize any potentially adverse

effects due to environmental pollutants and, at the same time,
achieve desired CVD health outcomes.

RCTs have demonstrated that omega-3 fatty acid supple-
ments can reduce cardiac events (eg, death, nonfatal MI,
nonfatal stroke) and decrease progression of atherosclerosis
in coronary patients. However, additional studies are needed
to confirm and further define the health benefits of omega-3
fatty acid supplements for both primary and secondary
prevention. For example, placebo-controlled, double-blind
RCTs are needed to document both the safety and efficacy of
omega-3 fatty acid supplements in both high-risk patients (eg,
patients with type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, and hypertension,
and smokers) and coronary patients on drug therapy. Mech-
anistic studies on their apparent effects on sudden death are
also needed.

A dietary (ie, food-based) approach to increasing omega-3
fatty acid intake is preferable. Still, for patients with coronary
artery disease, the dose of omega-3 (⬇1 g/d) may be greater
than what can readily be achieved through diet alone (Table
5). These individuals, in consultation with their physician,
could consider supplements for CHD risk reduction. Supple-
ments also could be a component of the medical management
of hypertriglyceridemia, a setting in which even larger doses
(2 to 4 g/d) are required (Table 5). The availability of
high-quality omega-3 fatty acid supplements, free of contam-
inants, is an important prerequisite to their extensive use.

After the publication of the AHA Scientific Statement “Fish Consumption, Fish Oil, Omega-3
Fatty Acids, and Cardiovascular Disease” by Kris-Etherton et al, which appeared in a previous
issue of the journal (Circulation. 2002;106:2747–2757), the following errors were noted in Table

Secondly, the footnote to “cod liver oil” should have read, “This intake of cod liver oil would
provide approximately the Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA) of vitamin A and twice the
RDA for vitamin D.” Finally, the EPA⫹DHA content for four fish was given incorrectly, and
should have been as follows:

Abstract Background and aims: Epidemiological studies evaluating the association of dairy
foods with risk of stroke have produced inconsistent results. We conducted a meta-analysis to
summarize the evidence from prospective cohort studies regarding the association between
dairy foods and risk of stroke.
Methods and results: Pertinent studies were identiﬁed by searching Embase (1950eNovember,
2013), Web of Knowledge (1950eNovember, 2013) and Pubmed (1945eNovember, 2013).
Random-effect model was used to combine the results. Doseeresponse relationship was as-

studies, with 28 138 stroke events among 764 635 participants, were included. Total dairy [rela-

but whole/high-fat dairy, nonfermented milk, butter and cream were not signiﬁcantly associated
with risk of stroke. Stronger association was found for stroke mortality than incidence, and for
studies conducted in Asia than Europe, while the association did not differ signiﬁcantly by
sex. Limited data did not ﬁnd any signiﬁcant association with either ischemic or hemorrhagic

Introduction

Stroke is the fourth leading cause of global disease burden
[1]. Over the past four decades, stroke incidence declined
by 42% in high-income countries but increased by 100% in
low to middle income countries [2]. About 87% of stroke

deaths occurred in low to middle income countries, and
the number of stroke deaths is projected to rise to 6.5
million in 2015 and to 7.8 million in 2030 globally without
intervention [3]. According to American Heart Association,
health behaviors including smoking, physical inactivity,
nutrition, and overweight and obesity should be taken into
account to reduce the risk of stroke [4]. Dairy foods are
rich in saturated fatty acids, which can enhance cardio-
vascular disease by increasing cholesterol levels; however,
dairy foods contribute many more compounds of health
importance [5]. Dairy foods are shown to have a potential
beneﬁt on risk of developing metabolic syndrome [5,6],

Dairy foods and risk of stroke

and a recent meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies
suggested that total dairy,
low-fat dairy and milk are
signiﬁcantly inversely associated with hypertension inci-
dence [7].
In recent years, prospective cohort studies
focusing on the relationship between dairy foods and risk
of stroke have reported both positive [8,9] and negative
[10e12] associations. However, ﬁndings from recent pro-
spective cohort studies on dairy foods and risk of stroke
have not been summarized systematically with a meta-
analysis. Given studies with relatively small number of
participants might be underpowered to detect the effect,
and even small health effects of dairy foods on risk of
stroke could have considerable public health consequences
considering the popularity of dairy foods, thus we con-
ducted a meta-analysis to (1) ﬁrst assess the risk of stroke
for the highest vs. lowest categories of dairy foods con-
sumption; (2) then evaluate the possible doseeresponse
relationship of dairy foods with risk of stroke when
possible; (3) and assess the heterogeneity among studies
and publication bias.

Methods

Literature search and selection

We performed a literature search using the databases of
Embase (1950eNovember, 2013), Web of Knowledge
(1950eNovember, 2013) and Pubmed (1945eNovember,
2013), using the search term ((((((((dairy) OR milk) OR
cheese) OR butter) OR cream) OR yogurt) OR yoghurt)) AND
((((cerebrovascular disease) OR cardiovascular disease) OR
stroke) OR cerebral infarction) without restrictions. More-
over, we reviewed reference lists from retrieved articles to
search for further relevant studies. Two investigators (DH
and JQH) independently reviewed all identiﬁed studies, and
studies were included if they met the following criteria: (1)
a prospective cohort design; (2) the exposure of interest
was dairy foods; (3) the outcome of interest was stroke; (4)
relative risk (RR) with 95% conﬁdence interval (CI) was
provided. If data were duplicated in more than one study,
we included the study with the largest number of cases.

Data extraction

The following data were extracted from each study by two
investigators (DH and JQH): the ﬁrst author’s last name,
publication year, follow-up duration, location where the
study was performed, sample size and number of cases,
type of dairy foods, RR (95% CI) for the highest vs. lowest
categories of dairy foods, variables adjusted for in the
analysis. For doseeresponse analysis, the number of cases
and participants (person-years), and RR (95% CI) for each
category of dairy foods were also extracted. The median or
mean level of dairy foods for each category was assigned to
the corresponding RR for every study. If upper boundary of
the highest category was not provided, we assumed that
the boundary had the same amplitude as the adjacent
category. We extracted RRs that reﬂected the greatest
degree of control for potential confounders.

Statistical analysis

Pooled measure was calculated as the inverse variance-
weighted mean of the logarithm of RR with 95% CI to
assess the strength of association. Random-effects model
was used to combine study-speciﬁc RR (95%CI), which
considers both within-study and between-study variation.
Heterogeneity was assessed quantitatively with I2, and I2
values of 25, 50 and 75% represent low, moderate and high
heterogeneity [13], respectively. Sensitivity analysis was
performed with one study removed at a time, [14] and a
study is excessively inﬂuential if the signiﬁcance of its
“omitted” meta-analytic estimate differed relative to the
overall estimate. Publication bias was evaluated using
Egger regression asymmetry test [15]. Meta-regression
was performed to assess
sources of
between-study heterogeneity [16]. Study quality was
assessed using the 9-star NewcastleeOttawa Scale (http://
www.ohri.ca/programs/clinical_epidemiology/oxford.asp,
accessed 10/14/2013).

the potential

For the association of total dairy foods with risk of
stroke, we ﬁrst combined the results within each study if
two or more types of dairy foods were reported. The result
for male and female was included as two separate results.
Butter, cream, ice cream and whole/high-fat milk were
included in the whole/high-fat dairy foods group.

A two-stage random-effects doseeresponse meta-
analysis [17] was performed to compute the trend from
the correlated log RR estimates across levels of dairy foods,
taking into account the between-study heterogeneity. In
the ﬁrst stage, a restricted cubic spline model with three
knots at 25th, 50th and 75th percentiles of the levels of
dairy foods was estimated using generalized least-square
regression. Then the study-speciﬁc estimates were com-
bined using the restricted maximum likelihood method in
a multivariate random-effects meta-analysis. A P-value for
non-linearity was calculated by testing the null hypothesis
that the coefﬁcient of the second spline is equal to 0.
Doseeresponse analysis was conducted when more than 3
separate results were available. All statistical analyses
were performed with STATA version 12.0, with P < 0.05
considered statistically signiﬁcant.

in
Supplementary Fig. 1. Two caseecontrol studies and one
study did not provide the RR (95%CI) were also excluded.
Three studies [18e20] were further excluded because of
duplicate reports from the same study population [21,22].
Finally, eighteen separate results from ﬁfteen prospective
cohort studies were included [2 separate results (male and
female) were available in 3 studies [8,11,23]] (Table 1).

Eight [8,11,12,23e27] of the ﬁfteen prospective cohort
studies focused on dairy foods and stroke mortality, and
the other seven [9,10,21,22,28e30] focused on dairy foods
and stroke incidence. Most of the studies adjusted results

for the known risk factors of stroke like smoking (but 1
study [24]), body mass index (BMI, but 2 studies [24,27]),
total energy intake (but 3 studies [25e27]) and alcohol
(but 3 studies [8,12,22]). Six studies adjusted for more than
3 other dietary factors [10,21,23,24,28,29], and nine studies
adjusted for physical activity [8e10,12,21,23,28e30]. Dairy
foods were estimated using weighed diet records for 3
consecutive days [11], 7-day household inventory method
[24], and self-administered food frequency questionnaire
in the other thirteen studies. All studies had a mean
follow-up duration of 10 years or more. Only the associa-
tion of milk consumption with risk of stroke could be
assessed in doseeresponse analysis, because of limited
results available for the other analysis.

Quantitative synthesis

(The main results are summarized in Table 2).

Total dairy

Highest vs. lowest levels of total dairy intake were asso-
ciated with risk of stroke [0.88 (0.82e0.94), I2 Z 61.8%,
Fig. 1]. Although no evidence of publication bias was found
(P Z 0.76, Supplementary Fig. 2), asymmetry in funnel plot
showed ‘small-study effects’ [31] in 3 results [22,24,26].
After excluding these 3 results, similar result was found
[0.88 (0.82e0.95)]. Sensitivity analysis showed that the
overall pooled estimate did not vary substantially with
exclusion of any one study (95%CI of re-estimated effect
omitting each study in turn ranged from 0.80 to 0.96,
Supplementary Fig. 3); in particular, exclusion of the ATBC
study including only male smokers [29], which was
different with that of the other studies, resulted in a
pooled effect of 0.86 (0.81e0.91), and the heterogeneity
dropped from 61.8% to 35.1%.

Meta-regression and subgroup analysis were conducted
to explore potential sources of heterogeneity and perform
comparison between groups. Association of total dairy intake
with risk of stroke mortality [0.80 (0.76e0.84)] was stronger
(P Z 0.01) than incidence [0.95 (0.87e1.03)]. And the asso-
ciation was stronger (P < 0.00) among studies conducted in
Asia [0.79 (0.75e0.82)] than Europe [0.95 (0.88e1.03)]. The
effect was consistent in studies with quality score (stars) of 8
[0.90 (0.85e0.95)] and 6e7 [0.86 (0.75e0.98)] (P Z 0.80),
and adjustment (yes or no) for 4 or more of the following
covariates (smoking, alcohol, total energy intake, BMI,
physical activity and 3 other dietary variables) [yes: 0.90
(0.84e0.97), no: 0.79 (0.75e0.83), P Z 0.17]. And the effect
did not differ signiﬁcantly by sex [male: 0.91 (0.78e1.07),
female: 0.86 (0.78e0.95), P Z 0.44], stroke subtypes
[ischemic: 0.92 (0.82e1.03), hemorrhagic: 0.96 (0.73e1.25),
P Z 0.92], fat content of dairy [whole-fat: 0.96 (0.92e1.01),
low-fat: 0.91 (0.85e0.97), P Z 0.25], and speciﬁc types of
dairy (milk, cheese, butter and cream) (Table 2). In addition,
length of follow-up (years) (P Z 0.68), year of publication
(P Z 0.40), mean age (P Z 0.58) and number of cases
(P Z 0.64) were found also not signiﬁcantly contributing to
heterogeneity, respectively.

Milk

The combined RR (95%CI) of stroke for highest vs. lowest
milk consumption (10 results) was 0.91 (0.82e1.01),
I2 Z 74.4% (Supplementary Fig. 4). Although no evidence
of publication bias was found (P Z 0.40, Supplementary
Fig. 5), asymmetry in funnel plot showed ‘small-study ef-
fects’ [31] in 3 results [22,24,26]. After excluding these 3
results, similar result was found: 0.92 (0.82e1.02). Sensi-
tivity analysis omitting 1 study in turn showed that the
ATBC study [29] was excessively inﬂuential because its
“omitted” meta-analytic estimate [0.86 (0.81e0.92)] dif-
fers in signiﬁcance relative to the overall analysis, and the
heterogeneity dropped from 74.4% to 27.9%. The associa-
tion remained not signiﬁcant excluding each of the other
studies in turn (Supplementary Fig. 6).

Excluding 2 studies [9,23] in which milk products were
also included showed similar result [0.91 (0.78e1.05)]
among the others having milk speciﬁcally. Larsson et al.
[29] presented result of whole-fat and low-fat milk sepa-
rately, and separated meta-analysis showed signiﬁcant
association when including the result of low-fat milk only
[0.90 (0.83e0.98)] but not whole-fat milk only [0.91
(0.83e1.01)].

the above-mentioned covariates [yes: 0.95 (0.87e1.04);
no: 0.82 (0.75e0.90)] (P Z 0.35). In addition, length of
(P Z 0.33), year of publication
follow-up (years)
(P Z 0.35), mean age (P Z 0.37) and number of cases
(P Z 0.19) were found also not signiﬁcantly contributing to
heterogeneity, respectively. The association of fermented
milk and nonfermented milk with risk of total stroke
events was 0.80 (0.71e0.89) and 1.02 (0.89e1.17), but the
difference was not signiﬁcant (P Z 0.09).

For doseeresponse analysis, dairy milk was estimated
to be on average 200 ml for each serving [32]. Data from 6

maximum at about 200 ml/day. The risk of total stroke
events was 0.88 (0.86e0.91), 0.82 (0.79e0.86), 0.83
(0.79e0.86), 0.85 (0.81e0.89), 0.86 (0.82e0.91), 0.91
(0.84e0.98) and 0.94 (0.86e1.02) for 100, 200, 300, 400,
500, 600 and 700 ml/day of milk, respectively (Fig. 2).
Excluding 2 studies [22,28] with stroke incidence, the non-

protection of milk on stroke mortality reach maximum at
about 200 ml/day [0.80 (0.77e0.84)].

Cheese, butter and cream (Supplementary Fig. 4)

Highest vs.
lowest cheese consumption (6 results)
conferred an RR (95%CI) of 0.94 (0.89e0.995), I2 Z 0.00%.

with risk of stroke. No evidence of publication bias was
found for cheese (P Z 0.62), butter (P Z 0.88) and cream
(P Z 0.30). Sensitivity analysis showed that the pooled
estimate did not vary substantially with exclusion of any
one study for cheese, butter and cream, respectively.

Discussion

Findings from this meta-analysis indicated that total dairy
foods might be inversely associated with risk of stroke
events, and the inverse association might be attributable
to low-fat dairy foods, milk (especially for fermented milk)
and cheese. A non-linear relationship was found between
milk consumption and risk of stroke, with the strongest
association (18% lower risk) being observed at about
200 ml/day, and direction of protection was still observed
at 700 ml/day [0.94 (0.86e1.02)].

Several biological mechanisms for the observed asso-
ciation have been proposed. First, the inverse association
might be mediated through reduction in blood pressure. A
recent meta-analysis showed that the risk of hypertension

originating

tripeptides,

per 200 g/day was 0.97 (0.95e0.99) for total dairy, 0.96
(0.93e0.99) for low-fat dairy, and 0.96 (0.94e0.98) for
milk, but high-fat dairy, total fermented dairy, yogurt and
cheese were not signiﬁcantly associated with hyperten-
sion incidence [7]. Randomized controlled trials (RCT)
suggested that
from milk
fermentation, could reduce blood pressure [33]. Result
from an RCT also indicated that milk protein supplemen-
tation was signiﬁcantly associated with  2.3 mmHg net
changes in systolic blood pressure [34]. Second, dairy
products are important contributors to saturated fatty
acids, which are considered to have negative effect on
cardiovascular disease due to their low-density lipopro-
tein cholesterol raising effect. However, a recent meta-
analysis found no association between saturated fat
intake and coronary heart disease [1.07 (0.96e1.19)],
stroke [0.81 (0.62e1.05)], and cardiovascular disease
[CVD, 1.00 (0.89e1.11)] [35]. Furthermore, dairy or milk fat
intake was inversely related to the risk of a ﬁrst event of
stroke [36]. These ﬁndings might partially explain the
inverse but not signiﬁcant association between whole/
high-fat dairy foods and stroke events. Other possible
mechanisms might involve the protection of potassium

foods was found to be an important predictor of serum

[43], which was found linearly associated with reduced
risk of hypertension [44].

A previous meta-analysis [32] found that per 200 ml/
day of dairy (mainly milk) was inversely but not signiﬁ-
cantly associated with stroke [0.87 (0.72e1.07), 6 pro-

was also updated by Bernstein et al. [21]. However, the
association of dairy foods with risk of stroke by stroke
events (incidence and mortality), location, sex and speciﬁc
types of dairy foods are still not summarized. In addition,
the doseeresponse relationship of dairy foods with risk of
stroke was still unknown. Our meta-analysis, with almost
twice the number of stroke cases and subgroup analysis,
should provide a better understanding regarding dairy
foods and risk of stroke. However, other limitations should
be considered.

First, moderate between-study heterogeneity was
found. Sensitivity analysis found that the heterogeneity
was caused mainly by result from the Finnish male
smokers [29]. Besides the older subjects and the very
narrow and quite high average intake of dairy foods, the
fact that only smokers involved might also contribute to
the discrepancy, because smoking is an established risk
factor of stroke [45]. Thus the effect of dairy foods on risk
of stroke among smokers deserves further investigation.
Second, the results for ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke
should be interpreted cautiously, because of small number
of results. Among the 6 studies included for ischemic
stroke, inverse association (signiﬁcant in 1, non-signiﬁcant
in 4) was found in 5 studies, while results from ATBC study
[29] indicated a positive effect [1.14 (0.99e1.32)]. Among
the 4 studies for hemorrhagic stroke, signiﬁcantly inverse
association was found in 1 study [27], while results from
the ATBC study [29] indicated a positive effect [1.33
(0.97e1.82)], and no association was found in the other 2
studies. Beneﬁcial effects of fermented dairy on cholesterol
concentrations and metabolism were found [46], and
cheese was found inversely associated with risk of stroke.
Yogurt, another commonly consumed fermented dairy,
was found signiﬁcantly associated with reduced risk of
stroke in both male and female in Netherlands Cohort
Study [23] but not in ATBC study [29]. While the study by
Sonestedt et al. showed a reduced risk of stroke with low-
fat but not high-fat milk [9], no association was found for
both low-fat and high-fat milk in ATBC study [29], and no
association was found for both low-fat and high-fat milk
(fermented or not) [23]. Low-fat and high-fat cheese was
not signiﬁcantly associated with risk of stroke [23],
respectively. However, the limited data precluded a robust
assessment of above-mentioned ﬁndings. In addition, re-
sults on the effect of cheese, milk, butter and cream were
also based on limited data, which need to be conﬁrmed.
Third, factors that might inﬂuence the effect estimation
should be noteworthy. Presumably, participants, especially
for individuals with high risk of developing CVD may have
changed dairy food consumption during follow-up, but the
proportion of men with a vascular event who had changed
to fat-reduced milk was no different to that in men who
had no vascular event in Caerphilly cohort [22], and similar
results were found after excluding those with suspected
unstable food habits [9,10]. Although we extracted RRs
that adjusted for the most confounders, the extent to
which they were adjusted and the possibility that the
observed association was due to unmeasured or residual
confounding should be considered. Fourth, a U-shaped
association was found between cheese consumption and
CVD risk among men by Sonestedt et al. [9] However,
doseeresponse relationship was only conducted for milk
in this meta-analysis, thus suggestions on amount of dairy
foods, cheese and low-fat dairy foods deserve to be
explored in further studies. Finally, although no signiﬁcant
publication bias was detected, validity of publication bias
test should be questioned because of small number of
studies included [31]. In addition, ‘small-study effect’ [31]
was detected in funnel plot, however, similar results were

found after excluding the 3 results [22,24,26] leading to
‘small-study effect’.

With regard to dietary protein sources, signiﬁcantly
reduced risk of stroke associated with substitution of red
meat with either of whole-fat dairy or low-fat dairy foods
was found in Nurses’ Health Study [21], and beneﬁt on risk
of stroke substituting sugar-sweetened beverages with
dairy was anticipated given the enhanced cardiometabolic
risk after higher intake of sugar-sweetened beverages [47].
However, there seems no need to substitute dairy for tea
and coffee, which were also inversely associated with risk
of stroke [48,49].

In summary, dairy foods, especially for low-fat dairy,
milk and cheese, might be associated with reduced risk of
stroke. Future studies are needed to examine the risk for
ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes separately, and clarify
the doseeresponse relationship.

BSTRACT
Background
Epidemiologic  data  on  the  possible
benefit  of  eating  fish  to  reduce  the  risk  of  coronary
heart disease have been inconsistent. We used data
from the Chicago Western Electric Study to examine
the relation between base-line fish consumption and
the 30-year risk of death from coronary heart disease.
Methods
The  study  participants  were  1822  men
who were 40 to 55 years old and free of cardiovascu-
lar disease at base line. Fish consumption, as deter-
mined from a detailed dietary history, was stratified
35 g per day). Mortality from
(0, 1 to 17, 18 to 34, and 
coronary heart disease, ascertained from death cer-
tificates, was classified as death from myocardial in-
farction (sudden or nonsudden) or death from other
coronary causes.
Results
During  47,153  person-years  of  follow-up,
there were 430 deaths from coronary heart disease;
293  were  due  to  myocardial  infarctions  (196  were
sudden, 94 were nonsudden, and 3 were not classi-
fiable). Cox proportional-hazards regression showed
that for men who consumed 35 g or more of fish dai-
ly as compared with those who consumed none, the
relative  risks  of  death  from  coronary  heart  disease
and  from  sudden  or  nonsudden  myocardial  infarc-
tion were 0.62 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.40
to  0.94)  and  0.56  (95  percent  confidence  interval,
0.33 to 0.93), respectively, with a graded relation be-
tween  the  relative  risks  and  the  strata  of  fish  con-
sumption (P for trend
0.04 and 0.02, respectively).
These findings were accounted for by the relation of
fish consumption to nonsudden death from myocar-
dial  infarction  (relative  risk,  0.33;  95  percent  confi-
dence interval, 0.12 to 0.91; P for trend
Conclusions
These data show an inverse associa-
tion between fish consumption and death from cor-
onary  heart  disease,  especially  nonsudden  death
from myocardial infarction. (N Engl J Med 1997;336:
1046-53.)

HE  idea  that  the  consumption  of  fish
reduces the risk of coronary heart disease
is  supported by data from five prospective

epidemiologic  studies,
studies,

ever, the results of other studies are apparently incon-

lar  diseases,  and  all  causes  in  the  Chicago  Western
Electric Study.

METHODS

Population

The Chicago Western Electric Study comprises 2107 men who
were 40 to 55 years old in 1957. Participants had been employed
for at least two years at the Western Electric Company Hawthorne
Works in Chicago and worked in occupations related to the man-
ufacture of telephones. The selection of participants, their demo-
graphic characteristics, the initial examination, and follow-up pro-
cedures have been described elsewhere.

Dietary Assessment

17

15-20

Dietary information was obtained at the first and second exam-
inations, performed one year apart by two nutritionists using stand-
ard  questionnaires.
  The  information  elicited  included  a  typical
workday eating pattern, a typical weekend eating pattern, the time
and place of meals, special diets, changes in eating habits over the
previous 20 years, and the consumption (frequency and quantity)
of 195 foods during the previous 28 days. Each participant’s daily
intake of nutrients was determined with the use of a food-compo-
sition table.

Food-profile scores, based on information obtained at the sec-
ond examination, indicated the level of consumption of 26 foods
over the previous 28 days: soft drinks; coffee; decaffeinated coffee;
whole milk; skim milk; cream; cheese; eggs; ice cream; puddings or
custards; soups; fish; beef, veal or lamb; pork, ham, or bacon; liver;
poultry; mixed dishes; vegetables; breads or cereals; potatoes; fruits;
pastries; sweets or sugars; butter; margarine; and fried foods. Each
item was coded on a four-point scale (0 for none and 1, 2, or 3 for
a low, moderate, or high level of consumption, respectively). Fish
consumption, in 120-g units per 28 days, was coded as 0 for none,
1  for  less  than  4  units,  2  for  4  to  8  units,  and  3  for  more  than
8  units, corresponding to the following average daily intakes: none,
1 to 17 g, 18 to 34 g, or 35 g or more.

Follow-up

Vital status was determined at the annual examination for the
first 10 years and by means of mailed questionnaires or telephone
interviews for the next 15 years; data were available for all 2107
men. For the 31st year, data on vital status were obtained from
the National Death Index, the Health Care Financing Adminis-
tration,  and  surviving  participants’  responses  to  questionnaires;
data  were  available  for  2084  of  the  participants  (98.9  percent).
The causes of death were determined from death certificates ac-
cording  to  codes  in  the 
International  Classification  of  Diseases,

FISH  CONSUMPTION  AND  THE  30-YEAR  RISK  OF  FATAL  MYOCARDIAL  INFARCTION

 (ICD-8).

 For the purposes of the analyses pre-
Eighth Revision
sented  here,  follow-up  began  after  the  second  examination  and
continued through the 31st anniversary of the date of enrollment
in the study.

21

End Points

The  end  points  of  the  study  were  death  from  myocardial  in-
farction  (ICD-8  code  410),  death  from  coronary  heart  disease
(ICD-8 codes 410 through 414), and death from cardiovascular
diseases (ICD-8 codes 400 through 445). Death from myocardial
infarction was classified as sudden or not sudden according to the
duration of the terminal illness and the place of death, as recorded
on the death certificate.

Statistical Analysis

Average base-line (1957 to 1959) dietary intake and cardiovas-
cular risk factors were calculated for four strata of fish consump-
tion: none, 1 to 17 g, 18 to 34 g, and 35 g or more per day. Age-
adjusted mortality rates for fatal myocardial infarction (all deaths,
sudden deaths, and nonsudden deaths), all deaths from coronary
heart disease, all deaths from cardiovascular diseases, and deaths
from all causes were calculated per 10,000 person-years for each
stratum  of  fish  consumption.  Cox  proportional-hazards  regres-
sion
 was used to estimate the relative risk of death and 95 per-
cent confidence interval for each stratum of fish consumption (as
compared  with  no  consumption),  with  adjustment  for  possible
confounding variables, and to test for linear trend (for the four
strata of fish intake classified as indicator variables). This model
was also used to test for possible interactions (the statistical power
was limited in this regard).

22

RESULTS

Of the 2107 men in the Chicago Western Electric
Study, 62 were excluded because they did not attend
the second examination. Another 223 men were ex-
cluded because of prior coronary heart disease (74)
or missing data on diet (93), education (38), body-
mass  index  (9),  serum  total  cholesterol  level  (5),
smoking status (2), or blood pressure (2), leaving a
total of 1822 men.

Characteristics at Base Line

Sixty-eight percent of the study participants were
blue-collar workers; 42 percent were Catholic (Table
1). (Religion was included as a variable because of
religious dietary practices.) On average, the study par-
ticipants were overweight, with higher-than-desirable
levels of blood pressure, serum cholesterol, and intake
of  total  fat,  saturated  fat,  and  cholesterol.  Over  half
(58 percent) were smokers, with a mean of 18 ciga-
rettes smoked per day. Most (85 percent) were drink-
ers, who consumed an average of 18.8 ml of alcohol
per day (4.2 percent of kilocalories).

Religion and the intake of total energy, ethanol,
several  macronutrients,  and  several  micronutrients
differed  significantly  among  the  four  strata  (Table
1). For all the nutritional variables except carbohy-
drate and saturated and monounsaturated fatty acid,
the highest levels were in the men with the highest
level of fish consumption. Age, education, body-mass
index, blood pressure, serum cholesterol level, smok-
ing  status  and  number  of  cigarettes  smoked,  heart

rate,  presence  or  absence  of  a  history  of  diabetes,
and presence or absence of electrocardiographic ab-
normalities  did  not  differ  significantly  among  the
four strata.

30-Year Mortality

During  30  years  of  follow-up,  there  were  293
deaths from myocardial infarction (196 sudden deaths,
94 nonsudden deaths, and 3 that were not classifi-
able),  430  deaths  from  any  type  of  coronary  heart
disease, 573 from any type of cardiovascular disease,
and 1042 from any cause. Of the 137 deaths from
coronary  heart  disease  other  than  myocardial  in-
farction (ICD-8 codes 411 through 414), few were
sudden.

Fish Consumption and Age-Adjusted Mortality

The age-adjusted rates of death from myocardial
infarction, coronary heart disease, cardiovascular dis-
eases,  and  all  causes  were  lowest  for  the  men  with
the highest consumption of fish, with a trend toward
lower mortality rates with higher levels of consump-
tion  (Table  2).  The  men  who  consumed  35  g  or
more of fish per day had a 42 percent lower rate of
death from myocardial infarction than the noncon-
sumers, a relation accounted for by the inverse asso-
ciation between nonsudden death from myocardial
infarction and fish consumption. In contrast, there
was only a moderate association between fish intake
and sudden death from myocardial infarction.

The trend toward an association between higher
fish consumption and lower rates of death from cor-
onary  heart  disease,  cardiovascular  diseases,  and  all
causes  was  attributable  to  the  inverse  relation  be-
tween fish consumption and death from myocardial
infarction,  particularly  nonsudden  death  from  my-
ocardial  infarction.  Thus,  when  deaths  from  myo-
cardial infarction were subtracted from deaths from
coronary  heart  disease,  deaths  from  cardiovascular
diseases,  and  deaths  from  all  causes,  there  was  no
significant graded relation between the four strata of
fish  consumption  and  death  rates;  the  result  was
similar  with  the  subtraction  of  nonsudden  deaths
from myocardial infarction (Table 2).

Fish Consumption and Multivariate-Adjusted Mortality

Three Cox proportional-hazards models were used
to calculate the relative risks of death for the men in
the four strata of fish consumption. Model 1 was ad-
justed  only  for  age.  Model  2  was  adjusted  for  age;
education;  religion;  systolic  blood  pressure;  serum
cholesterol;  number  of  cigarettes  smoked  per  day;
body-mass  index;  presence  or  absence  of  diabetes;
presence  or  absence  of  electrocardiographic  abnor-
malities;  daily  intake  of  energy,  ethanol,  macronu-
trients, and cholesterol; and daily intake of iron, thi-
amine,  riboflavin,  niacin,  vitamin  C,  beta  carotene,
and retinol. Model 3 was adjusted for all the non-

*Myocardial  infarction  (MI)  was  defined  as  ICD-8  code  410,  coronary  heart  disease  (CHD)  as  ICD-8  codes  410
through 414, and cardiovascular diseases (CVD) as ICD-8 codes 400 through 445. Nonsudden death from MI was de-
fined as death occurring more than 12 hours after the onset of the terminal acute illness (70 deaths) or if information
on the duration of the illness was unavailable, death occurring during the hospital stay (24 deaths). Sudden death from
MI was defined as death occurring no more than 12 hours after the onset of the terminal acute illness (164 deaths) or
if information on the duration was unavailable, death occurring out of the hospital or in the emergency room (32 deaths).
Death rates are per 10,000 person-years.

nutrient  variables  in  model  2  plus  daily  intake  of
energy, alcohol, and the four categories of food cor-
related with fish consumption and death from myo-
cardial  infarction  or  other  coronary  causes  (cheese,
margarine, mixed dishes, and vegetables).

The results were similar with all three models; the
data from model 2 are shown in Table 3. With adjust-
ment for multiple confounders, a significant inverse
relation prevailed between fish consumption and the
risk of a fatal myocardial infarction. For the men who
consumed  35  g  or  more  of  fish  daily  as  compared
with the nonconsumers, the relative risk of any death
from myocardial infarction was 0.56, and the relative
risk of nonsudden death from myocardial infarction
was  0.33  (Table  3).  The  results  were  similar  with
the addition of occupation to model 2 (r⫽0.51 for
the correlation with education) and with the use of
other  definitions  of  sudden  death  (instantaneous,
within one hour after the onset of symptoms, and
within three hours after the onset of symptoms).

The trend toward an inverse relation between fish
consumption and death from coronary causes, car-
diovascular causes, and all causes was accounted for
by the data on fatal myocardial infarction — specif-
ically, by the trend toward a lower risk of nonsudden
death  from  myocardial  infarction  with  higher  fish
consumption. No significant relation was found be-
tween fish consumption and sudden death from my-
ocardial infarction (Table 3).

In  these  analyses,  serum  cholesterol  level,  blood
pressure, number of cigarettes smoked per day, ma-
jor  electrocardiographic  abnormalities,  age,  dietary
cholesterol intake, and Keys dietary lipid score23 were
also significantly and independently related to mor-
tality from myocardial infarction.

In analyses with model 3, which was adjusted for
foods (instead of nutrients) and other variables, fish
consumption was significantly and independently re-
lated to the risk of any death from myocardial infarc-
tion and to the risk of nonsudden death from myo-
cardial infarction. With the variables for consumption
of cheese, margarine, mixed dishes, and vegetables in-
cluded individually in the model and with all four in-
cluded together, the relative risks of fatal myocardial
infarction for the men who consumed 35 g or more
of fish per day (as compared with the nonconsumers)
ranged  from  0.53  to  0.58,  with  95  percent  con-
fidence intervals that excluded values of 1.00 or high-
er (P for linear trend⫽0.004 to 0.019). The relative
risks of nonsudden death from myocardial infarction
ranged from 0.22 to 0.26, with 95 percent confidence
intervals that excluded values of 1.00 or higher (P for
linear trend⫽0.001 or 0.002).

To  assess  the  stability  and  independence  of  the
relation  between  fish  consumption  and  the  risk  of
death from myocardial infarction (all deaths and non-
sudden  deaths),  we  included  an  interaction  term  in
the Cox models for fish consumption and each var-

iable listed in Table 1, as well as for each of the four
food categories included in model 3. For any death
from  myocardial  infarction,  there  were  significant
interactions between fish consumption and age, ma-
jor electrocardiographic abnormalities, and consump-
tion  of  mixed  dishes;  for  nonsudden  death  from
myocardial  infarction,  there  was  a  significant  inter-
action between fish consumption and major electro-
cardiographic  abnormalities.  No  other  interaction
terms were statistically significant.

On the basis of these four significant interactions,
Cox analyses were performed with the following di-
chotomized  variables:  an  age  of  less  than  47  years
versus  an  age  of  47  or  older,  the  two  lower  strata
of consumption of mixed dishes versus the two high-
er  strata,  and  the  absence  of  major  electrocardio-
graphic abnormalities versus their presence. Among
the  917  men  who  were  younger  than  47  years
at base  line,  there  were  116  deaths  from  myocar-
dial infarction and 32 nonsudden deaths from my-
ocardial  infarction,  with  no  significant  relation  be-
tween fish  consumption and either end point (P for
trend⫽0.678  and  0.628,  respectively);  among  the
905  men  who  were  47  or  older,  there  were  177
deaths  from  myocardial  infarction  and  62  nonsud-
den deaths, with fish consumption significantly relat-
ed to both end points (relative risks for consumers of
35 g or more per day as compared with nonconsum-
ers, 0.41 and 0.15 [P for trend⫽0.019 and 0.005],
respectively). For low and high levels of consumption
of mixed dishes (946 and 875 men, respectively), the
relation of fish consumption to the risk of fatal my-
ocardial  infarction  was  similar:  the  men  who  con-
sumed 35 g or more of fish per day (as compared with
the  nonconsumers)  had  low  relative  risks  (0.42  and
0.58 for any death [P for trend⫽0.089 and 0.051, re-
spectively]  and  0.10  and  0.63  for  nonsudden  death
[P for trend⫽0.126 and 0.059, respectively]). For the
1761 men without major electrocardiographic abnor-
malities,  there  was  a  graded  relation  between  fish
consumption and the risks of any death from myocar-
dial infarction and nonsudden death from myocardial
infarction:  relative  risks  for  the  men  in  the  highest
stratum  of  fish  consumption  were  0.66  and  0.43
(P for trend⫽0.093 and 0.028), respectively.

Two other subgroup analyses also yielded signifi-
cant associations between fish consumption and the
risk of fatal myocardial infarction. Among the 1535
men who had no evidence of major organ disease at
base line, the relative risks for those in the highest
stratum of fish consumption were 0.55 for any death
and 0.48 for nonsudden death (P for trend⫽0.035
and 0.030, respectively). Among the 1693 men who
were classified as light or medium drinkers (consum-
ing less than 50 ml of alcohol per day), the relative
risks  for  those  in  the  highest  stratum  of  fish  con-
sumption were 0.58 and 0.31 (P for trend⫽0.040
and 0.022), respectively.

Model 2 Cox analyses were repeated for the first,
second, and third decades of follow-up, with 68, 97,
and 128 total deaths from myocardial infarction and
14, 34, and 46 nonsudden deaths from myocardial
infarction, respectively. The findings were consistent
for the three periods. In the highest stratum of fish
consumption,  the  relative  risks  of  any  death  from
myocardial  infarction  were  0.57,  0.59,  and  0.59
(P  for trend ⫽0.563, 0.329, and 0.039) for the first,
second, and third decades, respectively; the relative
risks  of  nonsudden  death  from  myocardial  infarc-
tion  were  0.16,  0.61,  and  0.38,  respectively  (P  for
trend ⫽0.019,  0.413,  and  0.109).  In  other  words,
the relation between fish consumption and the risk
of  fatal  myocardial  infarction  persisted  throughout
the 30 years of follow-up.

DISCUSSION

We found significant, independent, inverse grad-
ed associations between base-line fish consumption
and the 30-year risk of death from coronary heart
disease, particularly nonsudden death from myocar-
dial infarction. Differences in death from coronary
heart disease, cardiovascular diseases, and all causes
among  the  four  strata  of  fish  consumption  were
attributable to differences in death from myocardial
infarction, especially nonsudden death. Correspond-
ingly,  fish  consumption was not significantly associ-
ated  with  the  risk  of  death  from  other  coronary
causes.

The findings from four of seven prospective pop-
ulation studies — the Zutphen and Rotterdam (the
Netherlands)  studies,  the  Swedish  study,  and  the
study  of  U.S.  physicians  (12-year  data)1,2,4,6  —  are
broadly  concordant  with  our  data  showing  a  sig-
nificant  inverse  relation  between  fish  consumption
and the risk of death from coronary heart disease, as
are  the  results  from  the  two  case–control  studies7,8
and the one intervention trial.9 However, in regard
to one specific aspect of death from coronary heart
disease — whether it was sudden or not sudden —
our findings apparently differ from those of the Phy-
sicians’ Health Study6 and the Seattle Study.8 Both
these studies found that higher consumption of fish
was  associated  with  a  lower  rate  of  sudden  death,
whereas  our  data  indicate  a  significantly  lower  rate
of nonsudden but not sudden death.

In contrast to these studies, the Bergen (Norway),
Hawaiian, and U.S. Health Professionals studies found
no relation between fish consumption and coronary
heart disease.10,11,14 This apparent inconsistency may
be  due  to  different  methods  of  assessing  diet  and
categorizing  fish  consumption;  different  distribu-
tions  of  reported  fish  consumption;  differences  in
study sites and times, with associated dietary differ-
ences (e.g., levels of intake of cholesterol, saturated
fats,  antioxidants,  and  fiber)  that  might  influence
the relation between fish consumption and the risk

of  coronary  heart  disease;  and  different  periods
of  follow-up,  ranging  from  four  years  to  several
decades.

In  our  analyses,  we  deliberately  focused  on  the
end point of fatal myocardial infarction (ICD-8 code
410) and its components of sudden and nonsudden
death,  rather  than  on  overall  mortality  from  coro-
nary heart disease. This attention to fatal myocardial
infarction  was  stimulated  by  recent  research  find-
ings.  In  randomized,  controlled  trials,  the  lower
rates of death from coronary heart disease in the in-
tervention groups reflected, in full or in part, lower
rates of death from myocardial infarction.24-26 Most
of the overall decline in the rate of death from cor-
onary  heart  disease  in  the  United  States  in  recent
decades can be attributed to a decline in the rate of
fatal myocardial infarction; there has been a relative-
ly small decrease in the rates of death from other cor-
onary  causes  (ICD-8  codes  411  through  414).27,28
Also, the results of local studies — including studies
of men in Chicago cohorts — indicate that much of
this decline in the rate of fatal myocardial infarction
is due to decreased rates of sudden death from my-
ocardial infarction.29-35 On the basis of these findings,
our hypothesis was that fish consumption is inversely
related  to  sudden  death  from  myocardial  infarction.
Thus, our finding that base-line fish consumption is
independently and significantly related to the risk of
nonsudden  but  not  sudden  death  from  myocardial
infarction  was  unexpected.  It  will  be  important  to
determine whether this finding is reproducible. Two
other observational studies recently reported an in-
verse relation between fish consumption and sudden
death,6,8 which is inconsistent with our results. One
problem  may  be  the  definition  of  sudden  death,
which may differ among studies.

If fish consumption is indeed protective against fa-
tal myocardial infarction, data from some of the ep-
idemiologic studies indicate that the ingestion of small
amounts  of  fish,  including  mainly  lean  (nonfatty)
fish, provides sufficient protection.1 Could the pro-
tective  effect  of  consuming  small  amounts  of  fish
over  a  period  of  decades  be  due  to  the  very  small
amounts  of  n⫺3  long-chain  polyunsaturated  fatty
acids  ingested?36-46  This  seems  unlikely,  since  most
studies show that effects on plasma lipids and throm-
bogenic factors require much larger amounts of these
fatty acids. Recent findings, however, suggest favor-
able influences on total and intermediate-density lip-
oprotein  triglycerides  (but  not  on  cholesterol).47
Could  the  protective  effect  be  related  to  the  influ-
ences  of  these  fatty  acids  on  cell  membranes?8,48
Could the components of fish protein (e.g., partic-
ular combinations of amino acids) be involved?

In conclusion, data from the Chicago Western Elec-
tric  Study  show  a  significant,  graded,  independent
inverse association between base-line fish consump-
tion and the 30-year risk of fatal myocardial infarc-

tion, particularly nonsudden death from myocardial
infarction.  This  relation  accounted  for  the  lower
rates  of  death  from  all  coronary  causes,  all  cardio-
vascular  causes,  and  all  causes  in  association  with
higher  fish  consumption,  which  persisted  through-
out the 30 years of the study and in analyses adjusted
for potentially confounding demographic, biomedi-
cal, and dietary factors. Further studies — observa-
tional and interventional — are needed to determine
whether  regular  ingestion  of  moderate  amounts  of
fish  provides  substantial  protection  against  myocar-
dial infarction.

Summary

Introduction Oxidised  LDL  is  thought  to  play  an  important
part  in  the  pathogenesis  of  atherosclerosis.  Observational
studies  have  associated  ␣ tocopherol  (vitamin  E),  ␤
carotene, or both, with reductions in cardiovascular events,
but not clinical trials. We did a meta-analysis to assess the
effect  of  these  compounds  on  long-term  cardiovascular
mortality and morbidity.

Methods We analysed seven randomised trials of vitamin E
treatment and, separately, eight of ␤ carotene treatment; all
trials  included  1000  or  more  patients.  The  dose  range  for
vitamin E was 50–800 IU, and for ␤ carotene was 15–50 mg.
Follow-up ranged from 1·4 to 12·0 years.

Findings The  vitamin  E  trials  involved  a  total  of  81 788
patients and the  ␤ carotene trials 138 113 in the all-cause
mortality  analyses.  Vitamin  E  did  not  provide  benefit  in
mortality  compared  with  control  treatment  (11·3  vs 11·1%,
odds ratio 1·02 [95% CI 0·98–1·06] p=0·42) or significantly
decrease risk of cardiovascular death (6·0 vs 6·0%, p=0·86)
or  cerebrovascular  accident 
(3·6  vs 3·5%,  p=0·31). 
␤ carotene led to a small but significant increase in all-cause
mortality (7·4 vs 7·0%, 1·07 [1·02–1·11] p=0·003) and with
a  slight  increase  in  cardiovascular  death  (3·4  vs 3·1%,  1·1
[1·03–1·17]  p=0·003).  No  significant  heterogeneity  was
noted for any analysis.

Interpretation The  lack  of  a  salutary  effect  was  seen
consistently  for  various  doses  of  vitamins  in  diverse
populations.  Our  results,  combined  with  the 
lack  of
mechanistic data for efficacy of vitamin E, do not support the
routine use of vitamin E.

Introduction
The oxidative-modification hypothesis of atherosclerosis1–4
has  prompted  the  study  of  antioxidant  vitamins  in  the
prevention  of 
initiation  and  progression  of
cardiovascular  disease.  Preclinical  studies  suggested  that
supplementation of the diet with various compounds that
have  antioxidant  properties  before  the  development  of
vascular  disease  inhibited  the  atherogenic  process.5–9
These  findings  led  to  several  large,  prospective,  cohort
studies  in  human  beings,  in  which  significant  reductions
in mortality10 and cardiovascular events11,12 were identified
in men and women taking antioxidant vitamins. However,
sizeable randomised trials of antioxidant vitamins13–17 have
shown no such mortality reduction, although in one study
non-fatal  myocardial  infarction  (MI)  was  significantly
reduced.18 More importantly, in two randomised trials of
␤ carotene16,19 no benefit, and possibly an increased risk of
cardiovascular  events,  was  seen.  Findings  from  small
randomised  studies  of  antioxidant  vitamins  have  also
suggested  a  potential  harmful  effect  of  antioxidant
vitamins  in  patients  with  known  or  suspected  coronary
disease.20,21

Despite the absence of efficacy of antioxidant vitamins
reported  in  larger  randomised  trials,  two  important
opinion  articles  have  favoured  the  universal  use  of
multivitamins  by  consumers.22,23 The  multivitamins
recommended,  however,  contain  ␤ carotene  and 
␣ tocopherol (vitamin E), two compounds that have not
been  proven  to  reduce  cardiovascular  morbidity  or
mortality,  and  may  adversely  affect  lipid  concentrations
when used at higher doses.13,20 Since the use of antioxidant
vitamins  continues  to  grow,  partly  encouraged  by
physicians  advocating  their  use,24 we  did  a  meta-analysis
of  randomised  trials  to  find  out  what  effect  antioxidant
vitamins  have  on  all-cause  mortality  and  cardiovascular
death.

Methods
Study population 
We  did  a  MEDLINE  search  to  identify  all  randomised
controlled  trials  of  antioxidant  vitamins  in  primary  and
secondary  prevention.  We  used  the  search  terms:
“randomized  controlled  trials”,  “vitamin  E”,  and  “beta
carotene”.  We  did  additional  searches  for  known  trial
acronyms  cited  in  review  articles,  and  searched  by  hand
the  bibliographies  of  primary  studies  identified  through
the initial search. To limit the effects of publication bias of
smaller  trials  we  included  only  studies  of  1000  or  more
patients.  To  reduce  the  possibility  of  confounding  from
inclusion  of  nutritionally  deficient  populations,  our
analysis  was  limited  to  studies  in  populations  from
developed  countries  without  overt  evidence  of  vitamin
deficiencies.

Two  investigators  (DPV  and  SKS)  independently
reviewed the primary studies to assess the appropriateness
for  inclusion  in  our  analysis  and  data  abstraction.  Trial

interest 

inclusion was based on the quality of the study’s methods,
including trial size, randomisation scheme, and use of an
intention-to-treat  analysis.  The  prospectively  identified
outcomes  of 
included  all-cause  mortality,
cardiovascular  death,  all-cause  cerebrovascular  accident,
and  non-fatal  MI.  Many  trials  did  not  report  the
individual rates of non-fatal MI and, therefore, we chose
to  use  the  more  widely  reported  combined  endpoint  of
cardiovascular death or non-fatal MI. We excluded trials
without all-cause mortality data. 

the  studies 

We  identified  12  trials  for  analysis  (tables  1  and  2).
Eight trials involving ␤ carotene alone or in combination
with  other  antioxidants  were  analysed  (table  1).  We
further  classified 
in  our  analysis  by
cardiovascular risk of the study population. Four studies
were  secondary  prevention  studies,  defined  as  including
patients  with  known  or  documented  vascular  disease,
active  tobacco  use  or  asbestos  exposure,  or  documented
history  of  previous  malignant  disease.  The  Alpha-
Tocopherol  Beta  Carotene  Cancer  Prevention  Study
(ATBC)16 investigated  the  effects  of  ␤ carotene,  vitamin

E, or both, on the frequency of major cardiac events and
rate  of  lung  cancer  in  a  population  of  middle-aged  male
smokers.  The  Beta  Carotene  and  Retinol  Efficacy  Trial
(CARET)19 assessed  efficacy  and  safety  of  ␤ carotene  in
men  and  women  at  high  risk  of  lung  cancer  because  of
previous asbestos exposure or extensive cigarette smoking.
The Heart Protection Study (HPS)13 assessed the impact
of  an  antioxidant  vitamin  combination  (600  mg  vitamin
E, 250 mg vitamin C, and 20 mg ␤ carotene) on vascular 
and non-vascular mortality and morbidity among patients
at  high  risk  because  of  history  of  coronary  disease,
diabetes, or peripheral vascular disease. The Skin Cancer
Prevention  Study  (SCP)25 assessed  the  efficacy  of 
␤ carotene in the secondary prevention of non-melanoma
skin  cancer  among  elderly  patients  who  had  a  history  of
biopsy-proven basal-cell or squamous-cell carcinoma.

Four ␤-carotene trials were primary prevention studies
or  were  among  low-risk  patients.  The  Age-Related  Eye
Disease Study (AREDS)26 assessed the safety and efficacy
of an antioxidant combination (15 mg ␤ carotene, 400 IU
vitamin  E,  and  500  mg  vitamin  C)  in  the  prevention  of

We identified seven trials involving vitamin E alone or in
combination with other antioxidants, which we assessed in
a separate analysis. Most of these trials studied the efficacy
of vitamin E in secondary prevention (table 2). In addition
to ATBC16 and HPS,13 the secondary prevention trials were
the  Cambridge  Heart  Antioxidant  Study  (CHAOS),18 the
Gruppo  Italiano  per 
lo  Studio  della  Sopravvivenza
nell’Infarto  miocardico  (GISSI)  Prevention  Study,17 and
the  Heart  Outcomes  Prevention  Evaluation  (HOPE)
study.15 The  goal  of  CHAOS  was  to  study  the  efficacy  of
vitamin E in the prevention of cardiovascular death or non-
fatal  MI  in  patients  with  angiographically  documented
coronary disease. Similarly, GISSI assessed the efficacy of
vitamin E on cardiovascular death, non-fatal MI, or stroke
in  patients  with  recent  MI  (⭐3  months).  In  addition  to
AREDS,  the  Primary  Prevention  Project  (PPP)14 studied
the  efficacy  of  vitamin  E  among  patients  who  had  one  or
more  cardiovascular  risk  factors,  including  hypertension,
diabetes, or early family history of coronary disease. In HPS
and  AREDS,  patients  were  randomly
assigned  antioxidant  combinations  con-
taining ␤ carotene and vitamin E. ATBC
and  WHS  used  two-by-two  factorial
designs  for  randomisation, 
in  which
participants  received  vitamin  E  alone, 
␤ carotene  alone,  both  vitamins,  or
neither  vitamin.  These 
trials  were
included in each of the individual meta-
analyses  for  ␤ carotene  and  vitamin  E.
The WHS study has not yet reported the
results  of  the  vitamin  E  randomisation
and,  therefore,  we  did  not  include  this
study in the vitamin E analysis.

publication. Within each study, we used a ␹2 test to assess
the effect of vitamin treatment, and odds ratios and 95% CI
were calculated. We took p<0·05 to be significant. We used
a  Breslow-Day  test  to  test  the  homogeneity  of  the  odds
ratios  across  the  trials,  for  which  p<0·05  was  deemed
significant.  Cochran-Mantel  Haenszel  tests  were  used  to
investigate the effect of vitamin therapy on each endpoint
across  the  ␤ carotene  and,  separately,  across  vitamin  E
trials, and pooled odds ratios and 95% CI were calculated.

Results
In  total,  138 113  patients  were  assigned  ␤ carotene  or
control treatment (table 1). The all-cause mortality rate was
7·4%  in  the  ␤ carotene  group  and  7·0%  in  the  control
group  (figure  1).  The  odds  ratio  of  all-cause  death 
for patients treated with  ␤ carotene was slightly increased
(1·07  [95%CI  1·02–1·11]  p=0·003).  The  endpoint  of

Discussion
The small harmful effect we noted for
␤ carotene was driven by the increased
risk  reported 
in  the  CARET  and
ATBC  studies,  in  which  the  patients
were  at  high  risk  of  lung  cancer,  and
represented  34%  of  our  total  sample 
of  patients.  With  the  exception  of  the
NSCP  trial,27 the  tendency  towards  a
harmful  effect  on  death  was  strikingly
consistent  across  all  major 
trials,
including  diverse  populations.  Our
findings  are  especially  concerning
given  that  the  relevant  ␤ carotene
doses 
are 
in
preparations 
over-the-counter
vitamin supplements and are included
in  smaller  doses  in  readily  available
multivitamin  supplements  that  have
been advocated for widespread use.22,23
The trend towards a beneficial effect of
␤ carotene 
in
NSCP  requires  further  explanation.

The  initial  enthusiasm  for  the  clinical
use  of  antioxidant  vitamins 
the
prevention  of  cardiovascular  disease
stemmed  from  positive  results  in  the
preclinical setting. Animal data suggested
antioxidants,  particularly  vitamin  E,
prevented initiation of disease progression
in  laboratory  animals  without  known
atherosclerosis.5,6 These  early  positive
findings  and  the  presumed  safety  of
antioxidant supplementation led to large,
prospective  cohort  studies,  in  which  an
association  between  antioxidant  vitamin
intake,  serum  vitamin  concentrations,  or
cardiovascular
both, 
outcomes  were  reported.10–12,31
In  an
analysis from the Lipid Research Clinics’
Primary  Prevention  Trial,  men  with
serum carotenoid concentrations in the highest quartile had
a  36%  reduction  in  the  risk  of  cardiovascular  disease  or
non-fatal MI.31 A similar proportionate reduction in the risk
of coronary disease was noted in men and women with the
highest  vitamin  E  intakes.11,12 However,  findings  were  not
confirmed  in  prospective  cohort  randomised  trials,  which
suggests confounding. 

improved 

and 

Other factors associated with improved cardiovascular
outcomes, such as lifestyle, degree of fitness, and diet are
difficult to assess precisely and were not fully accounted
for  in  these  prospective  analyses.  Moreover,  the  trials
assessed  vitamin  supplement  use  and  the  association
between food intake rich in antioxidants and subsequent
cardiovascular  events.  Antioxidant-rich  foods  might
provide  other  beneficial  nutrients  such  as  flavenoids 
and  lycopenes  not  present  in  standard  oral  vitamin
supplements.  The  natural  forms  of  vitamins  in  food 
may  have  biological  activity32 or  potency33 different  to
those for synthetic vitamin compounds
used  in  supplements.  For  instance, 
the  natural  form  of  vitamin  E,  or 
d-␣-tocopherol  (1·5  IU/mg)  is  more
bioavailable 
synthetic 
form,  all-rac-␣-tocopherol  1·1  U/mg).
Importantly,  unlike  most  large-scale
randomised trials of vitamin E, HOPE
and  CHAOS  used  the  natural  form,
and, thus, the neutral findings in these
trials on hard endpoints may refute the
hypothesis  of  a  differential  clinical
effect  between  natural  and  synthetic
sources of ␣ tocopherol.

on lipids.37 Other studies may provide an explanation for
the harmful or null effects of vitamin-E-based antioxidant
treatment. In the HDL-Atherosclerosis Treatment Study
(HATS),20 an antioxidant combination including vitamin
E (800 IU) blunted the HDL raising effect of niacin and
simvastatin  and  resulted  in  poor  clinical  outcomes.  The
rise in HDL2, the protective fraction of HDL, was most
noticeably  lessened.  Other  workers  have  challenged  the
suggestion that vitamin E is a potent in-vivo inhibitor of
LDL oxidation. In a randomised placebo-controlled study
in healthy adults, involving doses of vitamin E as high as
2000 mg daily, Meagher and colleagues38 showed that the
breakdown products of lipid peroxidation were unaffected
despite  a  substantial  increase  in  plasma  vitamin  E
concentrations. Finally, some researchers have speculated

that antioxidants are more effective in inhibiting the early

than  preventing  sequelae

is
consistent with this hypothesis.40

in 

The  issue  of  timing  of  antioxidant  treatment  is
pertinent  because  the  striking  benefit  of  vitamin  E
reported  in  observational  studies  occurred  in  primary
prevention settings among patients without documented
vascular  disease.11,12 Given  that  in  only  one  randomised
trial  in  our  meta-analysis  was  vitamin  E  studied  alone 
in  primary  prevention,14 our  null  results  were  driven 
by  trials  of  vitamin  E  used  as  secondary  prevention.
Perhaps further study of vitamin E in primary prevention
populations  will,  therefore,  be  of  interest.  In  all  animal
studies  in  which  a  significant  antiatherosclerotic  effect 
of  vitamin  E  has  been  reported,  the  vitamin  E  was
started  at  the  time  of  high-fat  diet  or  before  any
histological  evidence  of  neointimal  or 
fatty-streak
formation.7 That  said,  human  trials  that  would  start
therapy in patients in their adult years are highly unlikely
to show significant benefit.

Our  meta-analysis  has  several  limitations.  Although
we  clarified  inconsistencies  or  missing  data  with  the
primary investigators, we did not reconfirm all published
data  with  the  primary  researchers.  Although  we  did 
not  use  a  standard  definition  for  clinically  relevant
endpoints, all-cause mortality data were available for all
trials  and  this  is  an  objective  and  unbiased  endpoint.41
Because  of  the  lack  of  detailed  outcome  data,  we  were
unable  to  assess  the  effect  of  antioxidant  vitamins  in
specific cohorts of patients of interest with high oxidative
stress, such as smokers and patients with diabetes and on
haemodialysis.  This  point  is  notable  because  in  one
small  randomised  trial  of  antioxidant  use  in  a  renal
dialysis population, MI was reduced by 70%.30 However,
among  the  20 536  patient  HPS  trial,  which  represents
almost  25%  of  the  patients  assigned  vitamin  E  in  our
analysis,  no  preferential  benefit  of  antioxidant  vitamins
was seen in a subgroup analysis including active smokers
and patients with diabetes. Another potential limitation

populations 
in  developed  countries
without known vitamin deficiency. On
the basis of the results of a randomised
trial in nutritionally deficient Chinese,
vitamin  supplementation  might  have 
a role in this population43 or in patients
with  vitamin  deficiencies  secondary  to  malabsorption 
of  fat-soluble  vitamins.  Finally,  we  saw  no  benefit 
from  antioxidants  in  long-term  outcomes,  but  this  does
not  disprove  the  oxidative-modification  hypothesis  of
atherosclerosis.39 Although  the  doses  of  antioxidant
vitamins 
the
recommended  daily  allowances,44 and  the  trials  that
measured  vitamin  concentrations  reported  several-fold
rises in plasma vitamin concentrations,13,16,18,19,25,26,28 no trial
assessed  efficacy  of  antioxidant  supplementation  by
measuring  markers  of  lipid  peroxidation.  Thus,  the
vitamins  used  might  have  been  inadequately  dosed,38
given to patients with low-level oxidative stress,39 or given
too late in the course of cardiovascular disease to achieve 
a  clinically  relevant  impact  from  inhibition  of  LDL
oxidation.

Given  the  results  of  this  meta-analysis,  the  use  of
vitamin supplements containing ␤ carotene and vitamin
A, ␤ carotene’s biologically active metabolite, should be
actively  discouraged  because  this  family  of  agents  is
associated with a small but significant excess of all-cause
mortality and cardiovascular death. We recommend that
clinical  studies  of  ␤ carotene  should  be  discontinued
because of its risks. When used as secondary prevention,
vitamin  E  did  not  reduce  the  risk  of  cardiovascular
endpoints.  Furthermore,  given  our  results  and  the  lack
of mechanistic data supporting efficacy of vitamin E as a
potent  antioxidant  in  vivo,  we  do  not  support  the
continued use of vitamin E treatment and discourage the
inclusion of vitamin E in future primary and secondary
prevention  trials  in  patients  at  high  risk  of  coronary
artery disease.

Abstract

The international guidelines issued by the World Health Organization recommend reduction in dietary saturated fat and cholesterol
intakes as means to prevent hypercholesterolemia and cardiovascular disease (CVD); however, only limited data are available on the
benefits of fruit and vegetable consumption on CVD risk factors in a community-based population. The aim of this study was to examine
whether, and to what extent, intake of fruits and vegetables is inversely associated with CVD risk factors in adults. In this population-based
cross-sectional study, a representative sample of 840 Tehranian adults (male and female) aged 18 to 74 years was randomly selected in
1998. Multivariate logistic regression adjusted for lifestyle and nutritional confounders was used in 2 models. After adjusting for
confounders, dietary fruit and vegetable were found to be significantly and inversely associated with CVD risk factors. Adjusted odds ratio
for high low-density lipoprotein concentrations were 1.00, 0.88, 0.81, and 0.75 (P for trend b .01) in the first model, which was adjusted for
age, sex, keys score, body mass index, energy intake, smoking status, dietary cholesterol, and history of diabetes mellitus and coronary
artery disease, a trend which was not appreciably altered by additional adjustment for education, physical activity, and saturated,
polyunsaturated, and total fat intakes. This association was observed across categories of smoking status, physical activity, and tertiles of
the Keys score. Exclusion of subjects with prevalent diabetes mellitus or coronary artery disease did not alter these results significantly.
Consumption of fruits and vegetables is associated with lower concentrations of total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and with the
risk of CVD per se in a dose-response manner.

1. Introduction

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are among the most
common causes of death and disability worldwide [1]. The
risk of CVD rises with increasing age, body weight, blood
pressure, cigarette smoking, alcohol intake, and dyslipidemia
[2,3]. Epidemiologic studies have shown that elevated
concentrations of serum total cholesterol and low-density
lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) are independent risk factors
for CVD [4,5]. Plasma concentrations of LDL and other risk
factors of CVD are influenced by both genetic and
environmental factors. Although it is difficult to alter genetic
factors, modifiable environmental factors such as smoking or

dietary patterns could be targeted in preventive interventions
aimed at lowering these risk factors.

The standard international guidelines issued by the World
Health Organization [6] recommend reductions in dietary
saturated fat and cholesterol intakes as means to prevent
hypercholesterolemia; however, only limited data are avail-
able on the benefits of fruit and vegetable consumption on
CVD risk factors in a community-based population. Data on
the effects of fruit and vegetable intakes on LDL are
inconsistent. In the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hyperten-
sion trial [7], a diet high in fruits and vegetables was not
associated with a significant reduction in LDL compared
with the control diet, although the trend suggests a decrease
in plasma LDL concentrations. In contrast, in other studies
[8],
fruit and vegetable consumption decreased LDL
concentration in hypercholesterolemic subjects.

In the current study, we evaluated whether higher intakes
of fruits and vegetables could be inversely related to CVD
risk factors.

2. Methods

2.1. Subjects

The current study is a cross-sectional study conducted
within the framework of the Tehran Lipid and Glucose Study
(TLGS), a prospective study of a representative sample of
residents of district 13 of Tehran, performed with the aim of
ascertaining the prevalence of noncommunicable disease risk
factors and developing a healthy lifestyle to curtail these risk
factors [9]. Tehran, the capital of Iran, is a metropolitan city
(with a population of about 12 million) composed of 20
urban districts, including district 13 in the eastern part of the
city. District 13 was chosen for the study for 2 reasons: (1)
the high stability of the population residing in this district
and (2) the age distribution of this district being representa-
tive of Tehran's population. In a previous study, we showed
that the TLGS provides a representative sample of the urban
population of Tehran [9]. In the TLGS, 15005 persons aged
at least 3 years were selected by a multistage cluster, random
sampling method; and a representative sample of 1476
persons was randomly selected for dietary assessment,
including 861 subjects aged 18 to 74 years. Data were
collected in 1998. In the current population-based cohort
study, we also excluded subjects whose reported daily
energy intakes were outside the range of 800 to 4200 kcal/d
(3347-17 573 kJ/d) [10]. Therefore, 840 subjects (361men
and 479 women), aged 18 to 74 years, remained for the
current analysis. Each subject provided written informed
consent, and the protocol of this study was approved by the
research council of The Endocrine Research Center of
Shahid Beheshti University (M.C.).

2.2. Measurements

While subjects were minimally clothed and not wearing
shoes, weight was measured with the use of digital scales
(Seca 707, Hanover, MD) and recorded to the nearest 100 g.
Height was measured with a tape measure while the
subjects were in a standing position with the shoulders in a
normal resting state and not wearing shoes and recorded to
the nearest centimeter (Seca 208 Portable Body Meter
Measuring Device). Body mass index (BMI) was calculated
as body mass (weight) in kilograms divided by height in
meters squared. Measurements were recorded to the nearest
0.1 cm, as reported earlier [11]. To reduce subjective error,
all measurements were taken by the same male physician
for all men and the same female physician for all women.
There was significant correlation between the test and retest
results taken by the male and female physicians (r N0.75,
P b .01 for both).

Physical activity level was determined using the Lipid
Research Clinics questionnaire [12], which is a simple and
comprehensible measure including 4 questions; no special
education is needed to complete this questionnaire, accord-
ing to which individuals are divided into 3 groups of light,
moderate, and heavy physical activity. Blood pressure was

measured twice after the participants sat for 15 minutes [13].
Additional covariate information about age, smoking habits
[14], medical history, and current use of medications [14]
was obtained with the use of validated questionnaires, as
reported earlier. Fasting blood samples were drawn for the
measurement of glucose and lipid concentrations after
overnight fast of 12 hours [15].

Usual dietary intake was assessed with the use of a 168-
item semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire (FFQ).
All
the questionnaires were administered by trained
dietitians who had more than 5 years of experience in the
Nationwide Food Consumption Survey project [16,17]. The
FFQ consisted of a list of foods with a standard serving size.
Participants were asked to report
frequency of
consumption of each food item during the previous year
on a daily (eg, bread), weekly (eg, rice, meat), or monthly
(eg, fish) basis. Portion sizes of consumed foods were
converted from household measures to grams [18]. Each
food and beverage were then coded according to the
prescribed protocol and analyzed for content of energy and
the other nutrients by using Nutritionist III software (version
7.0; N-Squared Computing, Salem, OR), designed for
Iranian foods.

their

The reliability of the FFQ in this cohort was evaluated in a
randomly chosen subgroup of 132 subjects by comparing
nutrient consumption ascertained by FFQ responses on 2
separate occasions. The correlation coefficients for the
repeatability of grain, vegetables, fruits, dairy, and meat
were 0.85, 0.79, 0.71, 0.74, and 0.70, respectively. The FFQ
also had high reliability for nutrients; for example,
the
correlation coefficient was 0.81 for dietary fiber. For fruit
consumption, each participant was asked how often, on
average, he or she consumed fruit such as apples, orange,
bananas, peaches, grapes, strawberries, pears, watermelon,
grapefruit, prunes, pomegranates, kiwi, persimmons, raisins,
figs, coconuts, apricots, sweet lemon, and lemon during the
previous year. For vegetable consumption, subjects were
asked about their average consumption of vegetables such as
onions, cucumbers, lettuces, carrots, cauliflower, Brussels
sprouts, kale, cabbage, spinach, mixed vegetables, corn,
green beans, green peas, peppers, beets, potatoes, tomatoes,
broccoli, and celery. Response categories ranged from
almost never, 1 to 3/mo, 1/wk, 2 to 4/wk, 5 to 6/wk, 1/d, 2
to 3/d, 4 to 6/d, to more than 6/d. The portion size of each
fruit and vegetable was specified to facilitate determination
of the number of typical servings and nutrient content.
Comparative validity was determined by comparison of FFQ
data with intake estimated from the average of twelve
24-hour dietary recalls (one for each month of the year).
Preliminary analysis of the validation study showed that
nutrients commonly found in fruits and vegetables were
moderately correlated using these 2 methods after control-
ling for total energy intake. These correlation coefficients
were 0.69 for dietary fiber and 0.67 for magnesium intake.
The validity of the FFQ for assessing fruit and vegetable
intakes was also good; the correlation coefficients for a

462

comparison between the FFQ and detailed dietary recalls
were 0.61 for fruits and 0.57 for vegetables. Overall, these
data indicate that
the FFQ provides reasonably valid
measures of the average long-term dietary intakes.

Blood glucose was measured on the day of blood
collection using the enzymatic colorimetric method with
glucose oxidase. Glucose tolerance status was classified
according to the World Health Organization criteria as normal
glucose tolerance, impaired glucose tolerance, or diabetes
[19]. Serum concentrations of total cholesterol and triglycer-
ide (TG) were measured by using commercially available
enzymatic reagents (Pars Azmoon, Tehran, Iran) adapted to
the Selecta auto analyzer (Vital Scientific, Spankeren, the
Netherlands). High-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C)
was measured after precipitation of the apolipoprotein B–
containing lipoproteins with phosphotungstic acid. Low-
density lipoprotein cholesterol was calculated according to
the method of Friedewald et al [20]. It was not calculated
when serum concentration of TG was greater than 400 mg/
dL. All samples were analyzed when internal quality control
met
the acceptable criteria. Interassay and intraassay
coefficients of variation were 2% and 0.5% for total
cholesterol and 1.6% and 0.6% for TG, respectively.

The Rose questionnaires [21] on chest pain were
completed for all participants, and Minnesota code of a
12-lead electrocardiogram [22] was taken. The prevalence of
coronary artery disease (CAD) based on its presence
according to the Rose questionnaires or electrocardiogram
or both of them was calculated.

2.3. Definition of terms

Cardiovascular risk factors were defined as follows: (1)
high total cholesterol (≥240 mg/dL), (2) high serum LDL-C

(N130 mg/dL), (3) low serum HDL-C (b40 mg/dL for men
and b50 mg/dL for women), (4) high serum TG concentra-
tions (≥200 mg/dL), (5) elevated systolic (≥140 mmHg)
or diastolic (≥90 mmHg) blood pressure, (6) abnormal
glucose homeostasis (fasting plasma glucose concentration
≥110 mg/dL), and (7) high BMI (>30 kg/m2) [23-26].
2.4. Statistical analysis

We used SPSS software (version 9.05; SPSS, Chicago,
IL) for all statistical analyses. Dietary recommendations are
graphically represented by a food pyramid consisting of 5
shelves. There is a recommended number of servings per
day from each shelf that
together combine to give an
overall healthy and nutritious diet for the general adult
population [27]. The second shelf relates to fruits and
vegetables, of which 4 or more servings per day are
recommended; subjects were hence categorized based on
category cut points: 0 to 1.9, 2 to 2.9, 3.0 to 3.9, and at
least 4 servings per day. Significant differences in general
characteristics across categories of
fruit and vegetable
intakes were searched using 1-way analysis of variance,
and P for differences was calculated. Besides, P for
regression (fruit and vegetable intake as independent
variable) was calculated. Food intakes were adjusted for
age, sex, and total energy intake. The χ2 test was used to
detect any significant differences in the distribution of
subjects across categories of fruit and vegetable intake with
regard to qualitative variables. We used a general linear
model to estimate adjusted mean concentrations of CVD
risk factors across categories of fruit and vegetable intakes.
Adjustment was made for age, sex, Keys score [28], BMI,
energy intake, smoking status (never, former, and current
smokers), dietary cholesterol, history of CAD, diabetes

mellitus, education (high school graduate or less, voca-
tional school, and college or more), physical activity (light,
moderate, heavy), total fat, saturated fat, and polyunsatu-
rated fat.

The Keys score correlates changes in fatty acid intake
with changes in serum cholesterol and is computed as
follows: Keys score = 1.35(2S − P) + 1.5√C [28], where S
and P are percentages of energy from saturated fat and
polyunsaturated fat, respectively, and C is dietary cholesterol

in milligrams per 1000 kcal. Therefore,
in secondary
analyses, we conducted stratified analyses according to
sex,
tertiles of Keys score, smoking status (current
nonsmokers and current smokers), and college education
(yes, no). Furthermore, we repeated the analyses after
excluding 159 subjects (n = 20 with diabetes mellitus, n =
120 with CAD, and n = 19 with both diseases). To ascertain
the association of fruit and vegetable intakes with CVD risks,
we used multivariable logistic regression in 2 models, with

3. Results

The study consisted of 840 subjects between 18 and
74 years of age; of these 840 subjects, 44.5% were men.
The average age of participants was 37.2 ± 13.5 years
(range, 18-74 years). Mean consumption of
fruit and
vegetables was 5.6 ± 3.4 servings per day (range, 0.5-19.8
servings per day). The mean and SDs of age and BMI as
well as the distribution of subjects with regard to college
education, diabetes mellitus, CAD, smoking, and physical
activity status across categories of fruit and vegetable
consumption are shown in Table 1. No significant
differences were observed between the age of participants
in category 1 (the lowest category) and those in category 4
of fruit and vegetable intake. Most subjects had light
activity in all categories of fruit and vegetable intake.
Subjects in upper categories of fruit and vegetable intake
were less likely to be daily smokers compared with the
other categories (P b .04). Higher intake of fruit and
vegetable products was associated with lower prevalence
of CAD (P b .01), higher educational attainment (P b .01),
and lower Keys score (P b .01).

Table 2 shows age, sex, and total energy intake and
adjusted dietary intakes of our population across categories
fruit and vegetable intake. Subjects in category 4
of
consumed more fiber
than did subjects in the other
categories. A higher intake of fruit and vegetable was
associated with a healthier diet and also higher energy intake
(P b .01), higher percentage of energy intake from
carbohydrate, higher intake of potassium and vitamin C,
and lower percentage of energy from total (P b .05) and
saturated fat (P b .04).

Multivariate-adjusted means for blood pressure and
serum lipid risk factors across categories of fruit and
vegetable intake are presented in Table 3. Subjects in the
upper category of fruit and vegetable intake had lower total
cholesterol, LDL-C, total cholesterol to HDL-C, and LDL-C/
HDL-C as compared with those in the lower category. No
significant differences were observed between TG, fasting
plasma glucose, HDL, and blood pressure of participants in
category 1 (the lowest category) and those in category 4 of
fruit and vegetable intake.

The distribution of subjects according to serum lipid risk
factors in different categories of fruit and vegetable is shown
in Table 4. The frequency of high LDL-C was the highest in
category 1 of fruit and vegetable consumption. To assess
residual confounding by dietary fat intake, we stratified by
tertiles of Keys score. From the lowest
to the highest
category of fruit and vegetable consumption, multivariate-
adjusted mean (±SE) for LDL-C concentrations were 128 ±
2, 118 ± 3, 109 ± 3, and 95 ± 4 mg/dL, respectively, for
the lowest tertile of Keys score (P b .04); these values were
130 ± 2, 120 ± 3, 109 ± 3, and 93 ± 4 mg/dL, respectively,
for the second tertile of Keys score (P b .02); and they were
128 ± 2, 120 ± 3, 110 ± 3, and 97 ± 4 mg/dL, respectively,
for the third tertile of Keys score (P b .04). In addition, when

stratified by sex, smoking status, and education, the relation
between fruit and vegetable intakes and LDL-C concentra-
tions persisted (data not shown).

Multivariate-adjusted odds ratios for the presence of
cardiovascular risk factors across categories of fruit and
vegetable intake are shown in Table 5. In categories 1 to 4 of
fruit and vegetables, adjusted odds ratios for high LDL
concentrations were 0.88, 0.81, and 0.75 (P for trend b .01)
in the first model, which we adjusted for age, sex, Keys
score, BMI, energy intake, smoking status (never, former,
and current smokers), dietary cholesterol, history of CAD,
and diabetes mellitus (Table 5). Additional adjustment for
education, physical activity, and saturated, polyunsaturated,
and total fat intakes did not alter the results. We repeated the
analysis with quartiles of fruit and vegetable intake; and
although results were not exactly the same, P for trend for
total cholesterol and LDL-C between quartiles remained
unchanged (data not shown).

4. Discussion

In this cross-sectional study, conducted in a group of
Tehranian inhabitants, we found that consumption of fruit
and vegetables was inversely related to total cholesterol and
LDL-C concentrations, independent of age, sex, Keys score,
smoking status, exercise, and educational attainment. Sub-
jects in the highest fruit and vegetable intake groups had
LDL-C and total cholesterol concentrations lower than those
in the lowest fruit and vegetable intake groups. On the other
hand, there was no significant difference in serum TG or
HDL-C levels between participants in fruit and vegetable
categories. Thus, the lower total cholesterol in participants
with higher intake of fruit and vegetable was due to lower
LDL-C levels, leading to a decrease in the atherogenic index
to HDL-C ratio) [29–31] and LDL-C/
(total cholesterol
HDL-C ratio.

Although several clinical trials and observational studies
have assessed the effects of dietary fat on LDL concentra-
tions, limited data are available on the association between
the consumption of fruit and vegetables and LDL concentra-
tions in a community-based population. The Food and Drug
Administration was one of the first national agencies to
recognize a role for fiber in CVD risk reduction. Products
that contain 0.75 g β-glucan or 1.78 g psyllium per serving
are permitted to carry a health claim stating that the product
will reduce the risk of coronary heart disease [32,33]. The
Food and Drug Administration further determined that 4
servings of these foods are likely to provide the effective
daily dose [32,33].

It is not clear in this study which constituents in fruit and
vegetable may have potential hypocholesterolemic action.
Generally, the effects of vegetables and fruits on cholesterol
metabolism are attributed to their fiber content. Isolated
dietary fiber from these plants such as pectins (12-50 g/d)
[34], guar gum (10-20 g/d) [35], and psyllium (6-15 g/d)

466

the cholesterol

[36] have been shown to lower cholesterol
levels in
humans. Studies of vegetarian diets have attributed some
of
lowering specifically to the pectin
component of soluble fiber found in fruits and vegetables
[34] because this soluble viscous fiber has been shown to
lower serum cholesterol [37]. Viscous fibers increase fecal
bile acid losses [38] and chenodeoxycholic acid synthesis
[36], and appear to be the best substantial mechanisms by
which fiber lowers serum cholesterol [39]. Very large losses
of fecal bile acids on the vegetable diet may therefore have
been related, in part, to pectin fiber content of the diet [34]
or the sheer bulk of food passing through the gastro-
intestinal tract. Increased chenodeoxycholate and cholate
synthesis rates were seen on the vegetable diet. The
resulting reduction in hepatic cellular cholesterol concentra-
tion would lead to up-regulation of the LDL receptor,
increased hepatic cholesterol uptake, and reduction in serum
levels as observed.

Diets rich in fruit and vegetables are good sources of
dietary fiber. In a randomized trial, a fiber-multivitamin
combination resulted in a reduction in LDL-C of 8% from
baseline after 8 weeks [40]. Other epidemiologic studies
[41,42] and a meta-analysis [43] showed LDL-C–lowering
effects of dietary fiber.

The absence of any difference in BMI between 4
categories despite higher calorie intake in upper categories
may be explained by higher intakes of fruit and vegetables as
well as total fiber, as Murakami et al [44] showed that dietary
fiber intake has an independent negative association with
BMI. So, we would expect lower BMI in the last category of
fruit and vegetable if energy intakes of our participants were
equal among 4 categories.

This study did not find any effect on blood pressure. In
contrast, in previous study of Appel et al [45], systolic blood
pressure was 2% lower in a fruit and vegetable group in
comparison with a control group; diastolic blood pressure was
1.3% lower. Furthermore, randomized controlled trials have
confirmed that a vegetarian diet, including a high amount of
fruit and vegetable consumption, could also lower blood
pressure [46,47]. Our study did not have sufficient statistical
power to distinguish such small differences. The absence of a
significant difference between blood pressure of the groups in
our study could thus be explained by the number of
participants or the cross-sectional design of the study, which
was not specifically designed to test a blood pressure
hypothesis. The composition of the diets however may be a
more likely explanation. The differences in the amount of
potassium between the low and high vegetable and fruit
groups were much higher in the trial of Appel et al [45] in
comparison with the amounts in our study (1700 and 4700 mg
for both diets, respectively). Vitamin C is another compound
that could have an effect on blood pressure [48]. In our study,
the high group had much higher intakes of vitamin C in
comparison with the low groups; but no effects on blood
pressure were found. Trials on vitamin C reported so far are
too limited to provide conclusive evidence of an effect of

vitamin C on blood pressure. In addition, these trials used
vitamin C supplementation in very high amounts (N400 mg/d).
Our study has some limitations. Given the cross-sectional
design, we cannot infer causality between fruit and vegetable
consumption and lower concentrations of LDL-C. However,
dietary patterns in adults are relatively stable; and the
exclusion of those with prevalent CAD and diabetes mellitus
did not alter the results significantly, making it more likely
that dietary intakes reported over the past year may reflect
the subjects' usual diets. Future studies that use longitudinal
data will provide stronger evidence on this association. In
addition, frequencies of fruit and vegetable consumption
were self-reported; thus, reporting bias might have affected
our estimates of the effect. After all, chronic diseases such as
CVD are heterogeneous; and along with dietary patterns,
other factors such as heredity may need to be considered.
Our data indicate that higher intake of fruits and vegetables
was associated with lower Keys score and lower percentage
of energy from saturated fat. This suggests that residual
confounding by saturated fat could have biased our
estimates. However, dietary cholesterol did not differ across
categories of fruit and vegetable intakes. In addition, the
inverse association between fruit and vegetable consumption
and LDL-C concentrations was observed across all tertiles of
Keys score. Thus, our
findings are less likely to be
attributable to the effect of substituting saturated fat and
dietary cholesterol with fruits and vegetables.

The current study has several strengths including the use
is representative of
of a population-based sample that
Tehran,
the use of logistic regression models, and the
simultaneous adjustment of confounding variables related to
the association between fruit and vegetable consumption and
CVD risk factors.

In conclusion, our data show that the consumption of
fruits and vegetables is associated with lower concentrations
of LDL-C and the risk of CVD per se in a dose-response
manner.

Flavonoids, flavonoid-rich foods, and cardiovascular risk:
a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials1,2

Lee Hooper, Paul A Kroon, Eric B Rimm, Jeffrey S Cohn, Ian Harvey, Kathryn A Le Cornu, Jonathan J Ryder,
Wendy L Hall, and Aedín Cassidy

ABSTRACT
Background: The beneficial effects of flavonoid consumption on
cardiovascular risk are supported by mechanistic and epidemiologic
evidence.
Objective: We aimed to systematically review the effectiveness of
different flavonoid subclasses and flavonoid-rich food sources on
cardiovascular disease (CVD) and risk factors—ie, lipoproteins,
blood pressure, and flow-mediated dilatation (FMD).
Design: Methods included a structured search strategy on MED-
LINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases; formal inclusion or ex-
clusion, data extraction, and validity assessment; and meta-analysis.
Results: One hundred thirty-three trials were included. No random-
ized controlled trial studied effects on CVD morbidity or mortality.
Significant heterogeneity confirmed differential effects between fla-
vonoid subclasses and foods. Chocolate increased FMD after acute
(3.99%; 95% CI: 2.86, 5.12; 6 studies) and chronic (1.45%; 0.62,
2.28; 2 studies) intake and reduced systolic (Ҁ5.88 mm Hg; Ҁ9.55,
Ҁ2.21; 5 studies) and diastolic (Ҁ3.30 mm Hg; Ҁ5.77, Ҁ0.83; 4
studies) blood pressure. Soy protein isolate (but not other soy prod-
ucts or components) significantly reduced diastolic blood pressure
(Ҁ1.99 mm Hg; Ҁ2.86, Ҁ1.12; 9 studies) and LDL cholesterol
(Ҁ0.19 mmol/L; Ҁ0.24, Ҁ0.14; 39 studies). Acute black tea con-
sumption increased systolic (5.69 mm Hg; 1.52, 9.86; 4 studies) and
diastolic (2.56 mm Hg; 1.03, 4.10; 4 studies) blood pressure. Green
tea reduced LDL (Ҁ0.23 mmol/L; Ҁ0.34, Ҁ0.12; 4 studies). For
many of the other flavonoids, there was insufficient evidence to draw
conclusions about efficacy.
Conclusions: To date, the effects of flavonoids from soy and
cocoa have been the main focus of attention. Future studies
should focus on other commonly consumed subclasses (eg, an-
thocyanins and flavanones), examine dose-response effects, and
be of long enough duration to allow assessment of clinically relevant
endpoints.

activities in vitro that may explain their potential cardioprotec-
tive properties, including antioxidant and antiinflammatory ef-
fects and induction of apoptosis (1).

Epidemiologic evidence of the cardiovascular effects of diets
rich in flavonoids is mixed, with some studies supporting (2–9)
and some not supporting (10 –13) positive effects. A large pro-
spective study of postmenopausal women with 16 y of follow-up
recently showed that dietary intakes of foods rich in anthocyanins
and flavanones were associated with a lower risk of all-cause
mortality, death due to coronary heart disease, and death due to
cardiovascular disease (CVD) (14).

To date, a substantial number of studies have reported on the
efficacy of individual plant foods or extracts in reducing biomar-
kers of CVD risk in acute and short-term interventions with
healthy volunteers and at-risk population groups. However,
these data have not been combined in a systematic examination
of the relative effects of the different subclasses of flavonoids.
To examine the relative importance of the different flavonoid
subclasses and flavonoid-rich foods, we undertook a systematic
review of all published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that
fit our criteria for inclusion. The aims of this review were to
determine optimal doses or food sources to reduce CVD risk and
to identify priorities for future research.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Search strategy

The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, and EMBASE were
searched by using soy and phytoestrogen terms to November
2006, flavonoid terms to July 2006, and flavonoid-related food
terms to June 2007. The structured search strategies used index-
ing and text terms as well as truncation and sensitive RCT filters
[ie, specific and sensitive strategies developed to ensure optimal
collection of RCTs in electronic searches (15)] in the following

INTRODUCTION

Dietary flavonoids represent a diverse range of polyphenolic
compounds that occur naturally in plant foods. The range and
structural complexity of flavonoids have led to their subclassi-
fication as flavonols, flavones, flavanones, flavan-3-ols (and
their oligomers, proanthocyanidins), isoflavones, and anthocya-
nins. They are present in significant amounts in many commonly
consumed fruits, vegetables, grains, herbs, and beverages. These

META-ANALYSIS—EFFECT OF FLAVONOIDS ON CVD RISK

format: [(flavonoid OR flavonoid-rich food text terms) OR (fla-
vonoid OR flavonoid-rich food indexing terms)] AND human
RCT filter. In addition, bibliographies of relevant reviews were
checked, and experts were contacted in September 2007 for fur-
ther studies. Non-English-language articles were translated
when possible.

Study selection

Titles and abstracts and then full manuscripts were excluded if
the studies reported were not randomized (with either a parallel
or crossover design); had no flavonoid intervention; recruited
children or pregnant or critically ill participants (although any
degree of CVD was permissible); included a multifactorial in-
tervention in which the effect of flavonoids could not be sepa-
rated; or did not provide data on CVD or CVD risk factors.
Flavonoid or flavonoid-containing food interventions had to pro-
vide, or advise on, a source of flavonoids that would be found as
normal dietary constituents; that is, phytoestrogens from clover
or bark products and chemically modified flavonoids were ex-
cluded. The intervention advised subjects either to eat more of or
to take extracts (or purified versions) of flavonoids or foods rich
in flavonoids from 욷1 of the following sources: flavonols, fla-
vanols, anthocyanins, anthocynanidins, benzoflavones, bifla-
vonoids, chalcones, flavanones, flavones, flavonolignans, and
isoflavones or foods rich in these flavonoids, such as apples,
onions, chocolate, tea, red grape juice, and soy (Table 1 and
Table 2). Studies were included only if a suitable control arm was
available that allowed any observed effects to be reasonably
ascribed to the flavonoids; for example, because alcohol itself
alters CVD risk biomarkers (25, 26), a red wine intervention
group had to be compared with a control group provided with a
similar amount of alcohol.

We did not identify any studies reporting cardiovascular
events (except, rarely, as adverse events). Therefore, we fo-
cused our primary outcomes on risk factors that have strong
and consistent epidemiologic relations with CVD as well as
evidence of causation [eg, LDL and HDL or systolic and
diastolic blood pressure (BP) (27–29)]. Because endothelial
dysfunction is an integral component of atherosclerosis, and
because in vitro evidence suggests that at least some fla-
vonoids exert their effects via the endothelium, endothelial
function [measured as flow-mediated dilatation (FMD)],
which is a predictor of cardiovascular events and which cor-
relates with other CVD risk factors (29 –33), was included as
a primary outcome.

When a title and abstract could not be rejected with certainty,
the full text of the article was obtained, and inclusion was as-
sessed independently by 2 assessors using an inclusion-
exclusion form. Disagreements were resolved by discussion
among 3 of us (AC, PAK, and LH).

Data extraction and quality assessment

A data extraction form including quality characteristics was
designed for the review and piloted by all of those involved in
data extraction. Twenty percent of all data extraction and of the
quality assessment was performed independently by 2 reviewers
to ensure uniformity, and all data were entered by a single re-
viewer, who checked the extracted data and validity criteria
against the original published report. Data were collected on
participants, intervention, control, and outcomes and on potential

effect modifiers, such as trial duration, flavonoid dose, type of
intervention (purified supplement, extract, or food rich in the
flavonoid), source of flavonoid, sex, and menopausal status.

Assessment of quality characteristics used a number of crite-
ria. They included allocation concealment (lack of foreknowl-
edge of treatment assignment: coded as adequate, unclear, or
inadequate), participant masking, researcher masking, outcome
assessor masking, reported industry funding, and a determina-
tion of whether saturated fat intake in the intervention and control
arms was similar (within 2% of total energy intake: coded as yes,
unclear, or no).

Data synthesis

For dichotomous outcomes, the numbers of participants ex-
periencing an outcome and the total numbers of participants
randomly assigned were extracted for each study arm from par-
allel randomized studies only. For continuous outcomes in par-
allel studies, the number of participants was assessed, and the
means and SDs of changes in the variables between baseline and
the end of the intervention period (for the intervention and the
control groups) were extracted. When these data were not avail-
able, the means and SDs of the outcome measurement in the
intervention and control arms were used. If the differences be-
tween intervention and control arms at baseline were greater than
the changes occurring in 욷1 of the arms, the data were not
included in the meta-analyses.

In crossover studies, it was intended that we would extract
paired t test data that evaluated whether the measurement on
intervention minus the measurement on control for each subject
was different from zero (34). However, because these data were
rarely provided in practice, we resorted to using means and SDs
separately on intervention and on control. This step provides a
conservative estimate of effect and reduces the power of cross-
over studies to show real effects of interventions (35). For all
data, SDs were calculated, when necessary, from SEs or CIs, and
data not provided in numerical form were estimated from figures.
Given the range of flavonoid subclasses found in individual
foods, it was decided to group studies by food sources when
feasible [eg, red wine and grape, chocolate and cocoa, black tea,
green tea, soyfoods, and soy protein isolate (SPI) and isoflavone
extracts]. When the number of studies was very small, studies
were grouped by the major flavonoid represented in the inter-
vention. The main analyses were performed for each food or
flavonoid group, and all trials with relevant outcome data were
included. Meta-analysis was performed with REVMAN soft-
ware (version 4.2.8; The Cochrane Collaboration, Oxford,
United Kingdom) by using the DerSimonian and Laird random-
effects model (34). The results of meta-analyses were considered
for further data analysis only when data from 욷3 studies were
available. To explore the effects of factors on the primary out-
comes, subgrouping was used when data from 욷5 studies were
included. These factors were the type of control or placebo group,
the type of intervention, the dose, the duration, the participants’
sex and menopausal status, and the participants’ baseline risk of
CVD (comparing hypertensive and normotensive participants
for assessment of BP and comparing dyslipidemic and normo-
lipidemic participants for assessment of serum lipids).

Meta-regression was planned, but not conducted, because
there were insufficient numbers of studies (or insufficient data on

relevant subgroups) within each flavonoid group for each out-
come. Sensitivity analysis was used to assess the robustness of
statistically significant results to trial quality, and funnel plots
were used to assess for evidence of bias (36). Cochran’s test for
heterogeneity was used to determine whether the studies in-
cluded in the meta-analysis were evaluating the same underlying
sizes of effect. A threshold of P 쏝 0.1 was used to decide whether
heterogeneity (genuine variation in effect sizes) was present. I2
(an estimate of the proportion of total observed variability that is
due to genuine variation rather than random error within studies)
was used to quantify the degree of inconsistency among studies;
it was considered substantial when it was 쏜50% (34, 37).

RESULTS

We screened 6393 titles or abstracts, of which 582 were or-
dered in full text. The review flow diagram is shown in Figure 1.
One hundred seventy RCTs (reported in a total of 242 published
articles) fulfilled all inclusion criteria, and the main characteris-
tics of included studies are shown in Table 3.

These 170 RCTs, which included 6557 participants, assessed
the effects of a flavonoid source compared with a control on a risk
factor for CVD included in our primary outcome measures. Of
the 133 trials that assessed the effect of flavonoids on 욷1 of our
primary outcomes (See Table S1 under “Supplemental data” in
the current online issue), 74 (56%) assessed the effects of soy- or
soy isoflavone– containing products. Of the remainder, most (n
҃ 49; 37%) examined the effects of flavanols (16 assessed the
effect of red wine or grape, 11 assessed chocolate or cocoa, 8

assessed black tea, 7 assessed green tea, and 7 assessed other
flavanols). To date, few studies (n ҃ 4) have determined the
effects of anthocyanins; flavonols, flavanones, or other fla-
vonoids (n ҃ 2 each); or anthocyanidins, benzoflavones, bifla-
vonoids, chalcones, flavones, or flavonolignans (no studies) on
the major CVD risk markers.

Another 13 studies reported that they had assessed effects on
a primary outcome, but data were not presented in a way that was
usable for the present meta-analysis. Study duration ranged from
acute (hours) to 52 wk; only 5 studies conducted an intervention
for a year, and 4 of those 5 studies assessed the effects of soy or
isoflavones. Fifty-four percent of studies used a crossover de-
sign, and many included only a small number of participants (the
median number of participants was as low as 14 and as high as 27
in different subclasses).

The quality of included studies varied, and attempts to mask
participants were reported in 76 studies, but masking of research-
ers and outcome assessors was less well reported (in 22 and 33
trials, respectively). Allocation concealment (ie, the person who
is recruiting is not aware of the study arm to which a participant
will be allocated until recruitment is complete) was clearly ade-
quate in only a few studies (13 of 170 trials). In 36 intervention
studies, the difference between intervention and control arms in
saturated fat intake was 쏝2% of total energy intake, but the
difference was unclear in the remaining 134 studies (studies with
a greater difference were excluded). Dropouts were clearly re-
ported in 101 studies, and some form of industry funding was
reported in 98 trials (58%) (Table 4).

Flow-mediated dilatation

Fifteen trials provided information on FMD after chronic (욷2
wk) flavonoid intake (Figure 2A), and 14 did so after acute (up
to 6 h) intake (Figure 2B). As expected, given the differences in
chemical structures and range of doses, we observed significant
heterogeneity between different flavonoid subgroups (P for het-
erogeneity 쏝 0.01, I2 ҃ 앒80% in both acute and chronic studies),
which confirmed that different flavonoid groups have different
effects on FMD.

Only the SPI and isoflavone extract groups included 욷3 stud-
ies assessing chronic effects on FMD, and neither group showed
statistically significant effects: SPI increased FMD by 1.77%
(95% CI: Ҁ0.23%, 3.77%; 4 studies), and isoflavone extract
increased FMD by 0.94% (95% CI: Ҁ0.39%, 2.27%; 4 studies).
The few studies on the chronic effects of red wine or grape and
other flavanols also do not suggest significant effects. The data
suggested a beneficial effect of black tea and chocolate or co-
coa— black tea increased FMD by 3.40% (95% CI: 1.85%,
4.95%; 1 study), and chocolate or cocoa increased FMD by
1.45% (95% CI: 0.62%, 2.28%; 2 studies)—and also suggested
that flavonols caused a reduction in FMD (1.4%; 95% CI: Ҁ2.66,
Ҁ0.14; 1 study). None of the meta-analyses suggested significant
heterogeneity.

When data were available from 욷3 acute studies, only choc-
olate or cocoa significantly improved FMD (3.99%; 95% CI:
2.86, 5.12; 6 studies, P for heterogeneity ҃ 0.1, I2 ҃ 46%;
70 –177 mg epicatechin/d, at 90 –149 min). In addition, studies of
red wine or grape and black tea suggested a modest benefit,
although neither was statistically significant and both were sig-
nificantly heterogeneous (red wine 1.25%; 95% CI: Ҁ0.12, 2.62;

4 studies; black tea 1.70%; 95% CI: Ҁ0.17, 3.57; 3 studies). For
many of the subclasses, including anthocyanins, flavanones,
green tea, and soyfoods, no published data on potential FMD
effects were available.

Chocolate or cocoa was the only group to show significant
effects, both acutely and chronically, on FMD. The time-course
suggests a peak effect at 앒2 h (Figure 3A), but subgrouping by
epicatechin dose (as stated within each study) does not suggest a
strong epicatechin dose effect (Figure 3B); however, this finding
does not rule out a dose-dependent effect of another component
of chocolate. Further chronic intake data would be necessary to
confirm a clinically significant effect. A funnel plot of the acute
effects of chocolate or cocoa (although including only 6 data
points) suggests reporting bias—ie, studies finding smaller FMD
effects may not have been reported, which would have inflated
the observed effects in the present meta-analysis (data not
shown). Because there was only a limited number of studies, and
because those studies were of varied validity, sensitivity analyses
(which removed studies with a greater risk of bias) tended to
result in a loss of the significant effects of cocoa and chocolate on
FMD. Removing studies that did not report attempted blinding of
participants did not alter the significantly positive effect of an
acute dose of chocolate or cocoa on FMD (4.9%; 95% CI: 3.1,
6.7; 4 studies), but the significant effect of chronic intake was lost
(3.6%; 95% CI: Ҁ1.7, 8.9; 1 study). Removing studies on the
basis of allocation concealment, blinding of researchers or out-
comes assessors, funding, or similarity of saturated fat intake in
the 2 arms or periods removed all studies, so results were not
robust to sensitivity analysis. The validity of chocolate or cocoa
studies is of importance. Two studies that contributed data to

chronic effects of chocolate on FMD were excluded because of
a large difference in the quantity of saturated fat provided in the
intervention and control groups (a difference between the 2
groups of 쏜2% in the energy from saturated fat). It is also worth
noting that a high proportion of studies (62%) in this group
reported that they were funded by the chocolate industry.

To date, few studies have looked at the effects of the different
flavonoids on glyceryl tri-nitrate (GTN)–mediated FMD, a mea-
sure of endothelium-independent dilatation, but there were 3

studies each for the chronic effects of isoflavone extract (show-
ing no effect: 0.35%; 95% CI: Ҁ3.04, 3.74) and the acute effects
of black tea intake (also showing no effect: Ҁ0.2%; 95% CI:
Ҁ1.5, 1.1). None of the flavonoid subgroups showed any signif-
icant effect on GTN-mediated FMD.

Chronic intake of chocolate and cocoa also had beneficial
effects on systolic and diastolic BP. Forty-four and 43 studies

diastolic BP, respectively, and 7 assessed the effect of acute
intake. Chronic consumption of black tea, red wine or grape, and
other flavanols (all with 욷3 included studies) did not show sig-
nificant effects on systolic or diastolic BP, but chocolate and
cocoa reduced both systolic (by 5.88 mm Hg; 95% CI: Ҁ9.55,

For the chocolate data, the clear heterogeneity in these anal-
yses is partly explained by dose and duration, so that subgrouping
by dose or duration reduces apparent levels of heterogeneity
(effects appear greater in studies with higher doses and shorter
duration; data not shown). There are only 5 data points, but the
funnel plot suggests that small studies showing large systolic BP
reductions may be overrepresented (funnel plots not shown).

foods were close to significance for both systolic and diastolic BP

groups). The data for isoflavone extracts suggest a reduction in
systolic BP (close to significance; Figure 4) but no effect on
diastolic BP.

subclasses. Chocolate increased FMD and reduced systolic and
diastolic BP after acute and chronic intakes. SPI (but not other
soy groups) significantly reduced diastolic BP and LDL choles-
terol. Acute consumption of black tea increased systolic and
diastolic BP, whereas that of green tea reduced LDL. For many
other flavonoid subclasses or flavonoid-rich foods, there was
insufficient evidence to draw conclusions about efficacy.

To our knowledge, this report is the first systematic review
assessing the effectiveness of the range of flavonoid subclasses
and flavonoid-rich food sources on CVD risk factors within
RCTs. Epidemiologic studies support the protective effect of
foods rich in flavonoids or total flavonoid intake on CVD, but
only some have examined the relative effectiveness of the sub-
classes (3, 5, 8 –14, 45–51). However, a recent prospective study

reported that anthocyanidins, flavanones, and foods rich in fla-
vonoids (including apples, pears, strawberries, red wine, choc-
olate, and bran) were associated with lower CVD mortality (14).
Shortcomings in the ability of this systematic review to quan-
tify the effects of flavonoid-rich foods and extracts on CVD risk
factors include the absence of studies powered to assess effects
on CVD and an absence or shortage of well-designed studies of
risk factors for most flavonoids. This review highlights areas in
which limited data exist, but this feature should not be interpreted
as lack of effectiveness.

The weaknesses of the available data include few and very
small studies; parallel studies with baseline levels of specific
outcomes differing widely between intervention and control
arms; crossover studies in which a paired t test is not reported;

and a large number of studies in which data on at least some
outcomes are missing or poorly reported. Problems with method-
ologic validity—including lack of evidence of adequate allocation
concealment, blinding, similarity of intervention and control arms in
terms of saturated fat intake, predominance of industry funding, and
suggested reporting bias—may all lead to exaggerated suggestions
of effectiveness (52). In addition, when there is evidence of
effectiveness of foods rich in flavonoids, it is not clear that the
flavonoids themselves (rather than other bioactive components)
are solely or partially responsible for the observed effects.

Given these reservations, this review provides evidence that
some flavonoids or foods rich in flavonoids, such as chocolate or
cocoa, and black tea, may modulate important risk factors. Choc-
olate and cocoa appear to reduce FMD acutely and reduce both
systolic and diastolic BP after chronic intake (although the effect
may be reduced over periods 쏜6 wk); data from studies of longer
duration would be valuable to examinations of the sustainability
of these effects. There is evidence that black tea leads to acute
rises in systolic and diastolic BP independent of caffeine content;
the mechanism for, and clinical consequences of, this effect
should be further explored. Chronic green tea intake may reduce
LDL concentrations significantly, and SPI (although not whole
soy or soy extracts) may reduce both LDL and diastolic BP after
chronic intake.

There is sufficient evidence (eg, 욷3 studies contributing data,
욷100 participants per arm, and statistical significance) to sug-
gest that chronic intakes of black tea have no overall effect on
systolic or diastolic BP or LDL or HDL cholesterol; those of
chocolate or cocoa have no effect on LDL or HDL cholesterol;
those of green tea, red wine or grape, and soyfoods have no effect
on HDL cholesterol; those of other flavanols (flavanols other
than those in studies of chocolate, tea, or red wine) have no effect
on systolic or diastolic BP; those on SPI have no effect on systolic
BP; and those of isoflavone extracts have no effect on diastolic
BP or LDL or HDL cholesterol.

The reduction in BP associated with chocolate or cocoa re-
ported here is similar to that identified in a review by Taubert et
al (53), although they included one study with very large
between-arm differences in saturated fat intake (which we ex-
cluded), and our analysis included a more recent trial. Their
review did not identify significant effects of black tea on BP,
probably because they combined data on green and black tea and
did not include several more-recent trials. Our results for soy
products are similar to those seen in previously published sys-
tematic reviews examining the effects of soy and isoflavones on
CVD risk factors—SPI appears to reduce LDL but generally has
no effect on HDL, and soyfoods and isoflavone extracts do not
show effects on lipids (54–58). Soyfoods were close to significance
for both systolic and diastolic BP, and isoflavone extract data sug-
gested a reduction in systolic BP but no effect on diastolic BP
(previous reviews also suggested no effect). Effects on FMD were
mixed, as reported in a previous review (56); we showed that SPI has
a positive but not significantly positive effect, but no effect was
observed for isoflavone extracts (59). The review also examined
effects on other CVD outcomes (our secondary outcomes, including
inflammatory markers), which will be reported separately.

Because of the wide range of flavonoid structures, it is not
surprising that we observed wide variability in the effects on
biomarkers of CVD risk. This heterogeneity of results also re-
flects wide variation in the bioavailability of the subclasses (1,

60). The most abundant flavonoid compounds may not neces-
sarily lead to the highest concentrations of biologically active
metabolites in target tissues, nor may they be the most biologi-
cally active in relation to specific health outcomes. Some sub-
classes are rather well absorbed; for example, after ingestion of
isoflavones (in amounts that are achievable by diet; see Tables 1
and 2), the flavanol epicatechin, the flavanones, and their me-
tabolites can reach micromolar concentrations in plasma (60). In
contrast, even large oral doses of anthocyanins result in only
nanomolar plasma concentrations (61). Flavonoids are thought
to influence FMD through effects on the acute response cell–
signaling pathways that increase nitric oxide production. In ad-
dition, numerous in vitro effects have been ascribed to the fla-
vonoids, including antioxidant and antiinflammatory effects and
effects on platelet aggregation (62– 64). However, many in vitro
studies have not taken bioavailability or metabolism into ac-
count, and the effects observed may not reflect the in vivo situ-
ation (65). The range of concentrations required to elicit effects
in vitro ranges from 쏝0.1 ␮mol/L to 쏜100 ␮mol/L, whereas
physiologic concentrations will rarely reach 10 ␮mol/L (61).

Together the data included in this meta-analysis suggest that
there may be clinically relevant effects of some flavonoid sub-
classes or flavonoid-rich foods on CVD risk factors; however, for
many subclasses, there are limited data from intervention trials
with which to examine potential efficacy. For example, antho-
cyanins and flavanones are commonly consumed as part of a
normal diet, and a future focus on these subclasses is needed to
determine their specific CVD effects.

The changes in risk factors observed after flavonoid intake are
clinically significant. In persons at low risk of coronary heart
disease, an FMD increase of 1.4% decreases Framingham risk by
1% (29). Our summary suggests that daily consumption of 50 g
dark chocolate increases FMD by 4% acutely and by 1.4% chron-
ically. The reduction of systolic BP by 5.9 mm Hg after chronic
intake of chocolate or cocoa, as found in this review, would, on
a population level, be expected to reduce stroke risk by 8%,
coronary artery disease mortality by 5%, and all-cause mortality
by 4% (66). Both green tea and SPI appear to reduce LDL cho-
lesterol by 앒0.2 mmol/L, which would be estimated to result in
a 3% reduction in all-cause mortality and a 6% reduction in both
CHD-related mortality and total CHD events (67). These are
profound effects and must be considered seriously in terms of the
potential for dietary phytochemicals to modulate CVD risk. As
with any intervention, potential risks also must to be considered,
eg, the acute rises in BP after black tea ingestion. Fifty g choc-
olate (doses typically used in reported trials were in the range of
50 to 100 g/d) provides 앒15 g fat and 앒230 kcal, 쏜10% of daily
energy intake, and 25% of recommended fat intake (68); this
addition to the diet may adversely affect weight and overall
dietary quality, counteracting observed CVD benefits. To
achieve the clinically important LDL reductions discussed
above, 2–5 mugs green tea/d (up to one-half of the usual fluid
intake) or 20-56 g SPI powder/d (up to 75% of the usual protein
intake) would be required, and hence the side-effects and effec-
tiveness of dietary regimens in reducing CVD risk should be
considered carefully.

In this systematic review, we assessed the effectiveness of
flavonoid subclasses and flavonoid-rich food sources in relation
to CVD risk factors by reviewing available published interven-
tion trials. The synthesis of the data from those trials provides an
important snapshot of the current state of the art and facilitates the

assess dose-response effects, be of adequate duration, and report
all outcomes assessed, particularly risk factors known to relate

Dairy intake
Coronary heart disease
CHD
Stroke

Aim: This study aimed to investigate the relationship between total dairy intake and dairy subtypes (high-fat
dairy, low-fat dairy, milk and milk products, cheese and fermented dairy) with incident coronary heart
disease (CHD) and stroke.
Methods: EPIC-NL is a prospective cohort study among 33,625 Dutch men and women. At baseline
(1993–1997), dairy intake was measured with a validated food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). The incidence
of both fatal and non-fatal CHD and stroke was obtained by linkage to the national registers.
Results: During 13 years follow-up, 1648 cases of CHD and 531 cases of stroke were documented. Total dairy
intake was not signiﬁcantly associated with risk of CHD (hazard ratio per standard deviation (SD)
increase =0.99; 95%-CI: 0.94–1.05) or stroke (0.95; 0.85–1.05) adjusted for lifestyle and dietary factors.
None of the dairy subtypes was to CHD, while only fermented dairy tended to be associated (p=0.07)
with a lower risk of stroke (0.92; 0.83–1.01). Hypertension appeared to modify the association of total
and low-fat dairy with CHD (p interaction b0.02). Among participants without hypertension, but not
among hypertensive participants, total (0.92; 0.85–1.02) and low-fat (0.94; 0.87–1.02) dairy tended to be
associated with a lower risk of CHD.
Conclusion: Our results provide no evidence that dairy products are associated with risk of CHD or stroke.
High intakes of total and low-fat dairy may be associated with a lower risk of CHD among participants with-
out hypertension, while fermented dairy could be associated with a reduced risk of stroke.

1. Introduction

The intake of dairy products was thought to be associated with an
increased risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) due to its relatively
high content of saturated fat. Dietary recommendations target a diet
limited in saturated fat, trans fat and cholesterol and therefore advise
consuming fat-free or low-fat dairy products [1]. Such recommenda-
tions have been based on the positive linear relationship among
dietary saturated fat, LDL cholesterol, and CVD risk [2].

However, a recent dose–response meta-analysis of 17 prospective
studies investigated the relation of total dairy, milk, and low-fat and
high-fat dairy with risk of CVD or all-cause mortality. The study

☆ This research was supported by a personal Dr. Dekker postdoctoral grant (2008T062)
from The Netherlands Heart Foundation (JW Beulens). SSS-M and MG obtained an
unrestricted grant from the Dutch Dairy Association (NZO) to carry out meta-analyses
on the association between dairy products and cardiovascular diseases.

indicated that milk intake was modestly inversely associated with
CVD risk [3]. For coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke and all-cause
mortality, no signiﬁcant association with milk intake was observed.
The authors also concluded that a limited number of studies are avail-
able to draw ﬁrm conclusions for speciﬁc subtypes of dairy like low-
or high-fat dairy and cheese, in particular for stroke.

Meanwhile, different kinds of dairy products with varying nutri-
ent compositions may have different effects on CHD or stroke risk.
Minerals, protein and vitamins from dairy products can exert blood
pressure- or cholesterol lowering effects, while saturated fat is associ-
ated with an increased risk of CHD [4]. Indeed, one study showed that
in particular the ratio of high-fat dairy to low-fat dairy products is as-
sociated with an increased risk of CHD [5].

In The Netherlands, large quantities and varieties of dairy products
are consumed, compared with other European countries [6]. There-
fore the Dutch population provides an excellent opportunity to inves-
tigate the relation of dairy consumption and its subtypes in relation to
CHD and stroke. The aim of this study is therefore to investigate the
relationship of dairy intake, including the speciﬁc dairy subtypes
high-fat dairy, low-fat dairy, milk and milk products, cheese and
fermented dairy, with CHD and stroke in a large prospective cohort
in the Netherlands.

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Study population and design

The EPIC-NL cohort is the Dutch contribution to the European Prospective Investi-
gation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) and consists of the Prospect-EPIC and
MORGEN-EPIC cohorts [7]. The Prospect-EPIC study includes 17,357 women aged
49–70 years living in Utrecht and vicinity who participated in the nationwide Dutch
breast cancer screening program between 1993 and 1997. The MORGEN-EPIC cohort
consists of 22,654 men (n=10,260) and women (n=12,349) aged 21–64 years selected
from random samples of the Dutch population in three different towns. Participants were
recruited in both studies from 1993 to 1997. Right from the start, both Dutch cohorts
collaborated closely to obtain maximal synergy on the design of the questionnaires and
to follow identical protocols in the collection of biological samples. Therefore, both cohorts
used standardized questionnaires and followed identical protocols in the collection of
biological samples. Because of the efﬁciency gain in maintaining the cohort infrastructure
and in conducting scientiﬁc analyses the two cohorts were merged into one EPIC-
Netherlands cohort in 2006 [7]. At baseline, a general and a food-frequency questionnaire
(FFQ) were administered, and a medical examination was performed for blood pressure
measurements, anthropometry, and blood sampling. All participants provided informed
consent before study inclusion. The study complies with the Declaration of Helsinki
and was approved by the institutional board of the University Medical Center Utrecht
(Prospect) and the Medical Ethical Committee of TNO Nutrition and Food Research
(MORGEN).

From the total cohort (n=40,011) subjects who did not give permission for link-
age with vital status registries were excluded (n=2717). Additionally, participants
without information on dietary intake (n=172) or with implausibly high or low
scores for total food intake (outside the range of 800–4200 kcal/d for men and
500–3500 kcal/d for women) (n=448) were excluded. Furthermore, subjects with
known cardiovascular disease (n=1099), cancer (n=1485) or diabetes (n=465) at
baseline were excluded, leaving 33,625 participants for the present analysis.

2.2. Dietary assessment

Daily nutritional intakes were obtained from a self administered FFQ containing
questions on the usual frequency of consumption of 79 main food items during the
year preceding enrollment. This questionnaire allows estimation of the average daily
consumption of 178 foods. A registered dietician checked the FFQ for inconsistencies,
which were resolved by contacting the participant. The validity of the FFQ was
assessed against 12 monthly 24-h recalls over a one-year period among 212 men
and women. Spearman correlations were good for milk and milk products (r =0.69
for men, r=0.77 for women) and moderate for cheese (r=0.56 and r =0.32, respec-
tively) [8,9].

Total dairy included all dairy food products except for butter and ice cream. Milk
and milk products included all kinds of milk, yogurt, coffee creamers, curd, pudding,
porridge, custard, and whipping cream. Cheese included all types of cheese except for
curd. Low-fat dairy is deﬁned as milk and milk products with a fat content b2 g/100 g
(skimmed or semi-skimmed milk products) or cheese with a fat content, b20 g/100 g.
High-fat dairy is deﬁned as milk and milk products with a fat content ≥2 g/100 g
(whole milk products) or cheese products with a fat content ≥20 g/100 g. Fermented
dairy included buttermilk, yogurts, and cheese.

2.3. Outcome assessment

Morbidity follow-up data on coronary heart disease (CHD) events and stroke events
were obtained from the Dutch Centre for Health Care Information which holds a standard-
ized computerized register of hospital discharge diagnoses. All diagnoses were coded
according to the International Classiﬁcation of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modiﬁca-
tion (ICD-9). Follow-up was complete until the ﬁrst of January 2008. The database was
linked to the cohort on the basis of birth date, gender, postal code and general practitioner
with a validated probabilistic method [10]. Information on vital status was obtained
through linkage with the municipal registries. Causes of death were collected from Statis-
tics Netherlands. Endpoints for the present analysis were CHD (ICD-9; 410–414, 427.5,
798.1, 798.2, 798.9) and stroke (ICD-9; 430-434, 436), whichever came ﬁrst. These end-
points included both fatal and non-fatal cases of CHD and stroke. In a secondary analysis,
we differentiated to non-fatal CHD obtained from hospital discharge diagnoses and CHD
mortality based on causes of death. Finally, to compare our results with the meta-
analysis [3], we used an endpoint of cardiovascular disease deﬁned as a broad range of
fatal and non-fatal vascular diseases including CHD, stroke, peripheral artery disease, con-
gestive heart failure and pulmonary embolism (ICD-9: 410–414, 427.5, 428, 415.1, 443.9,
430–438, 440–442, 444, 798.1, 798.2, 798.9). In a subsample of our cohort, cases of CHD
and acute myocardial infarction obtained from hospital discharge diagnoses were veriﬁed
against hospital records. This showed that 91% of CHD events and 97% of acute myocardial
infarction could be conﬁrmed [11].

2.4. Other measurements

The general questionnaire contained questions on demographic characteristics,
the presence of chronic diseases, and risk factors for chronic diseases. Smoking was
categorized into current, past, and never smoker. Level of education was categorized
as low (primary education up to those completing advanced elementary education),

average (intermediate vocational education and higher general secondary education)
or high (higher vocational education and university). Physical activity was assessed
using a questionnaire validated in an elderly population and categorized according to
the Cambridge Physical Activity Index [12]. Because it was not possible to calculate a
physical activity score for 14% of all participants missing scores were imputed using
single linear regression modeling (SPSS MVA procedure). During the baseline physical
examination screening, systolic and diastolic blood pressure measurements were
performed twice in the supine position on the right arm using a Boso Oscillomat
(Bosch & Son, Jungingen, Germany) (Prospect-EPIC) or on the left arm using a random
zero sphygmomanometer (MORGEN-EPIC), from which the mean was taken. Hyper-
tension was considered present when one or more of the following criteria were
met: systolic blood pressure ≥140 mm Hg, diastolic blood pressure ≥90 mm Hg,
self-reported antihypertensive medication use, or self-report of physician-diagnosed
hypertension. Height, and weight were measured, and BMI was calculated. All mea-
surements were performed according to standard operating procedures. In a 6.5%
random sample of the baseline cohort, total cholesterol was measured using enzymatic
methods and HDL-cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol were measured using a homoge-
neous assay with enzymatic endpoint. These assays, including the haemolytic, icteric
and lipemic indices (absorbance), were all performed on an autoanalyzer (LX20,
Beckman Coulter, Mijndrecht, The Netherlands).

2.5. Data analysis

Participant characteristics are presented as medians, means with standard devia-
tions or percentages. Intakes of total dairy and dairy subtypes were adjusted for total
energy intake according to the residual method [13]. Total dairy and its subtypes
were evaluated as continuous variables per standard deviation of the mean intake
which is 265 g/d for total dairy, 34 g/d for high-fat dairy, 216 g/d for low-fat dairy,
265 g/d for milk and milk products, 13 g/d for cheese and 123 g/d for fermented
dairy. Cox regression was used to estimate the hazard ratio and 95% conﬁdence inter-
val of the relation between total dairy intake and both fatal and non-fatal events of
CHD or stroke. The analyses were repeated for different types of dairy, i.e. high-fat
dairy, low-fat dairy, milk and milk products, cheese, fermented dairy and the ratio of
high-fat to low-fat dairy. The presence of nonlinear associations of total dairy and its
subtypes was explored by including the quadratic term of these intakes (per SD in-
crease) in the model with the linear term. No evidence for nonlinear associations
was found (with p values for quadratic terms ranging from 0.10 to 0.96).

All analyses were stratiﬁed for cohort. The duration of follow-up was calculated as
the interval between date of study entry and the occurrence of a cardiovascular event,
death, loss to follow-up, or January 1, 2008, whichever came ﬁrst. The estimates were
adjusted for age, sex and total energy intake (model 1). The second model additionally
included smoking, BMI, education and physical activity. Further adjustment was made
for the intake of coffee, ethanol, fruit, vegetables, ﬁsh, meat and bread (model 3).

The interaction between total dairy and possible effect modiﬁers, sex, age, BMI and
hypertension was tested by including interaction terms into the model. In sensitivity
analyses, we excluded cases occurring during the ﬁrst 2 years and those participants
censored in the ﬁrst 2 years. To explore whether observed relations were explained
by blood pressure, calcium or potassium, we adjusted for these variables in model 3.
The proportionality assumption was checked visually by means of log minus log
plots with no deviations detected. In the random sample (n=2050), multivariable
linear regression analysis was performed to assess the association between total
dairy or its subtypes (independent variable) and total cholesterol, HDL- and LDL-
cholesterol (dependent variable). Age, sex, total energy intake, smoking, BMI, educa-
tion, physical activity, intake of coffee, ethanol, fruit, vegetables, ﬁsh, meat and bread
were added as confounder.

Two-sided p-values below 0.05 were considered to be statistically signiﬁcant. All

statistical analyses were conducted SAS 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, US).

3. Results

During a mean follow-up of 13 years 1648 incident cases of CHD,
including 211 CHD deaths, and 531 stroke cases, including 128 stroke
deaths, were documented. Table 1 shows the baseline characteristics
of the study population. The median energy-adjusted total dairy in-
take was 392 g/d (quartile 1=221 g/d; quartile 3= 575 g/d). Low-
fat dairy (median: 230 g/d) accounted for the largest part of dairy in-
take, compared with high-fat dairy (median: 46 g/d). The median
daily intakes of milk and milk products, fermented dairy and cheese
were 356 g/d, 85 g/d and 16 g/d, respectively. Participants with a
high dairy intake were more active, smoked less often, drank less
alcohol and consumed more fruit and vegetables (data not shown).
Adjusted for age, gender and energy intake, dairy intake was
not associated with risk of CHD (HR per SD: 0.97; 95%-CI: 0.92–
1.02). Adjustment for lifestyle and dietary factors further attenuated
the association (HR: 0.99; 95%-CI: 0.94–1.05). None of the dairy sub-
types was related to CHD risk, although for high-fat dairy we

observed a slightly, but non-signiﬁcantly decreased risk of CHD (HR:
0.97; 95%-CI: 0.92–1.02) (Table 2). Specifying these analyses to non-
fatal CHD events and CHD mortality, we observed a borderline signif-
icant (p=0.10) inverse relation with a HR of 0.96 (0.90–1.01) per SD
increase for non-fatal events, while a non-signiﬁcant increased risk
was observed for CHD mortality (HRSD=1.05; 0.92–1.20).

In additional analyses total dairy intake was categorized in quar-
tiles. The association remains similar. After full-adjustment there
was no association with CHD risk (HR 0.91; 0.91–1.06 for the highest
versus lowest quartile).

Associations of dairy intake and risk of stroke were generally stron-
ger than for CHD (Table 3). Total dairy consumption was associated
with a lower risk of stroke adjusted for age, gender and total energy
with a HR of 0.90 (0.82–0.99) per SD increase. Fermented dairy (0.86;
0.78–0.95) and low-fat dairy (0.89; 0.81–0.98) were also associated
with a lower risk of stroke in model 1. However, after full adjustment,

these associations attenuated to non-signiﬁcant with a HR of 0.95
(0.85–1.05) for total dairy. Only fermented dairy tended to be associat-
ed (p=0.07) with a lower risk of stroke with a HR of 0.92 (0.83–1.01)
per SD increase. Finally, when investigating the relation of milk and
milk products with CVD, we observed a similar non-signiﬁcant associa-
tion as for CHD and stroke separately (HR=1.01; 95%-CI: 0.96–1.05).
We did not observe interactions between total dairy intake and
sex, age and BMI. Only for presence of hypertension, we observed
an interaction (p b0.02) with total dairy. Among participants without
hypertension, total dairy (0.92; 0.85–1.02) tended to be associated
(p=0.07) with a lower risk of CHD, while this was not apparent for
those with hypertension. Similar results were observed for milk and
milk products (0.92; 0.85–1.02) and low-fat dairy (0.94; 0.87–1.02)
among normotensive participants.

Adjusting all associations for blood pressure or excluding cases
occurring in the ﬁrst 2 years did not change our results (data not
shown). The associations of total dairy (HR: 0.94; 0.78–1.13) and
milk and milk products (HR: 0.95; 0.81–1.11) with CHD among
normotensive participants attenuated to non-signiﬁcant when we
adjusted for calcium and potassium. Including calcium and potassium
almost completely explained the association of low-fat dairy (1.00;
0.87–1.15) with CHD among normotensive participants. In the ran-
dom sample dairy intake or its subtypes were not associated with
total cholesterol, HDL- or LDL-cholesterol levels (data not shown).

4. Discussion

In this large cohort of 33,625 Dutch men and women, total dairy
consumption was not associated with risk of CHD or stroke. However,
among participants without hypertension, total dairy, milk and milk
products and low-fat dairy consumption tended to be associated
with a reduced risk of CHD. Fermented dairy tended to be associated
with a reduced risk of stroke.

Strengths of this study include its prospective design with over
10 years of follow-up and its large sample size. However, certain
limitations need to be addressed. Firstly, we relied on self-reported
intakes of dairy using an FFQ. This FFQ used was validated against
12 monthly 24-h recalls in a population of 121 subjects [9]. This
study showed good reproducibility (r=067–0.85) and good relative
validity for milk and milk products (r= 0.69 for men, r=0.77 for
women), but lower relative validity for cheese intake (r=0.56 and
r=0.32 respectively). This may have diluted the relation of cheese in-
take with CHD or stroke risk. Since dairy intake was assessed at base-
line only, the effects of participants subsequently changing their
pattern of dairy consumption are uncertain. However, we excluded
participants with prevalent diseases and, in a sensitivity analysis,
cases obtained in the ﬁrst 2 years who are most likely to alter their
dietary habits with similar results. Such reverse causation is therefore

928

unlikely to inﬂuence our results. Finally, as in any observational study,
observed associations could be due to differences in other factors
than dairy consumption. Despite adjustment for a large range of
possible confounders, we cannot exclude unknown or unmeasured
confounding.

The results from this study provided no evidence that total dairy
or milk and milk products are associated with risk of either CHD or
stroke. These ﬁndings are in line with a recent meta-analysis, that
showed no signiﬁcant association between total dairy or milk and
milk products with risk of CHD (1.00; 0.96–1.04) or stroke (0.87;
0.72–1.07) [3]. Recently, the Netherlands Cohort Study could not
detect an association between dairy products and all-cause or CVD
mortality as well [14]. Only milk and milk products were inversely
associated with risk of CVD in the meta-analysis with a HR of 0.94
(95%-CI: 0.89–0.99), an endpoint not primarily included in this
study. However, when investigating the association of milk and milk
products with a broad range of CVD in an additional analysis, we ob-
served a similar non-signiﬁcant association as we did for CHD and
stroke. The previously reported reduced CVD risk for milk and milk
products [3] seems to be mainly driven by effects of dairy consump-
tion on stroke, since the association of milk intake with stroke was
stronger than with CHD. Albeit not signiﬁcant, the association of
total dairy and milk and milk products with stroke in our study was
also stronger than for CHD.

Distinguishing between high-fat and low-fat dairy, we could not
detect signiﬁcant associations with CHD or stroke as well, consistent
with most previous studies [3]. Only the study by Hu et al. observed a
lower risk of CHD with high intakes of low-fat dairy [5]. Surprisingly,
in our study, only high-fat dairy tended to be associated with a lower
risk of CHD events, while it was associated with a non-signiﬁcantly
higher risk of CHD mortality. This suggests a speciﬁc relation of high-
fat dairy with fatal CHD that could perhaps be explained by the high
saturated fat content of these dairy products. A recent meta-analysis
indeed showed similar results for high saturated fat intakes with an in-
creased risk of fatal CHD (RR=1.32), while an RR of 0.99 was shown for
total CHD [15,16].

Presence of hypertension appeared to modify the relation of total
dairy, milk and milk products and low-fat dairy with risk of CHD. Only
among participants without hypertension, total dairy, milk and milk
products and low-fat dairy were associated with an approximately 8%
reduced risk of CHD per 200–250 g/d, while no association was ob-
served among participants with hypertension. These associations
could be explained by effects of dairy consumption on blood pressure,
since low-fat dairy intake is associated with reduced blood pressure
(relative risk 0.87; 95%-CI 0.74–0.95) [17]. However, adjusting the asso-
ciations between dairy and CHD for systolic and diastolic blood pressure
did not alter our ﬁndings. Moreover, blood pressure is more strongly
related to stroke than CHD [18]. Therefore, risk factors more strongly re-
lated to CHD like blood lipids could better explain our results. However,
adjusting for baseline total and HDL cholesterol in part of cohort did not
affect our results (data not shown). In addition, we could not detect
any signiﬁcant associations of total dairy intake and its subtypes with
blood lipid concentrations. It is therefore more likely that other factors
could be involved to explain these associations. Perhaps, minerals
from dairy products could play a role, since adjusting for potassium
and calcium explained part of the association between dairy and CHD.
However, this would then have to be driven by effects on other risk fac-
tors than blood pressure or blood lipids like inﬂammatory factors [19].
Finally, residual confounding could be involved. The DASH-diet was
reported to be more effective for participants with high sodium intakes
[20]. Possibly, hypertensive participants in our cohort already slightly
reduced their sodium intake, while normotensive participants did not.
Unfortunately, a FFQ is not a valid tool to estimate sodium intake and
we can therefore not address this effect.

We observed a borderline signiﬁcant inverse association between
intake of fermented dairy and risk of stroke. Larsson et al. investigated

associations between fermented dairy products and risk of stroke
and observed an inverse relation between cheese consumption and
cerebral infarction, but not for other fermented dairy foods like
yogurt or buttermilk [21]. Consistently, Goldbohm et al. observed an
inverse relation of fermented full-fat milk with all-cause mortality
and non-signiﬁcantly with stroke mortality [14]. Altogether, these
studies suggest an inverse relation between fermented dairy products
and risk of stroke. Blood pressure- [22] and cholesterol- [23] lowering
effects of fermented dairy could explain these relations. Speciﬁc
tripeptides originating from milk fermentation, for example, have
been suggested to reduce blood pressure [24], but a recent large ran-
domized trial failed to conﬁrm these results [25]. Another explanation
could be the effect of vitamin K2 that is mainly present in fermented
dairy products. Vitamin K2 has been previously shown to reduce
vascular calciﬁcation and subsequent risk of CHD in two prospective
cohorts [26,27], but the relation between vitamin K2 and risk of stroke
has not been investigated to date. Further research on the association
between fermented dairy products and risk of stroke is therefore
warranted.

In conclusion, our results provide no evidence that dairy products
are associated with risk of CHD or stroke in a generally healthy Dutch
population. Among participants without hypertension, high intakes of
total and low-fat dairy could be associated with a lower risk of CHD,
while fermented dairy may be associated with a reduced risk of
stroke.

ABSTRACT
Background: The consumption of dairy products may inﬂuence the
risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and total mortality, but con-
ﬂicting ﬁndings have been reported.
Objective: The objective was to examine the associations of milk,
total dairy products, and high- and low-fat dairy intakes with the
risk of CVD [including coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke]
and total mortality.
Design: PubMed, EMBASE, and SCOPUS were searched for ar-
ticles published up to February 2010. Of .5000 titles evaluated, 17
met the inclusion criteria, all of which were original prospective
cohort studies. Random-effects meta-analyses were performed with
summarized dose-response data. Milk as the main dairy product was
pooled in these analyses.
Results: In 17 prospective studies, there were 2283 CVD, 4391
CHD, 15,554 stroke, and 23,949 mortality cases. A modest inverse
association was found between milk intake and risk of overall CVD
[4 studies; relative risk (RR): 0.94 per 200 mL/d; 95% CI: 0.89,
0.99]. Milk intake was not associated with risk of CHD (6 studies;
RR: 1.00; 95% CI: 0.96, 1.04), stroke (6 studies; RR: 0.87; 95% CI:
0.72, 1.05), or total mortality (8 studies; RR per 200 mL/d: 0.99;
95% CI: 0.95, 1.03). Limited studies of the association of total dairy
products and of total high-fat and total low-fat dairy products (per
200 g/d) with CHD showed no signiﬁcant associations.
Conclusion: This dose-response meta-analysis of prospective stud-
ies indicates that milk intake is not associated with total mortality
but may be inversely associated with overall CVD risk; however,
Am J Clin Nutr
these ﬁndings are based on limited numbers.

INTRODUCTION

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the main cause of death in the
Western world, claiming 17 million lives per year (1). The burden
from coronary heart disease (CHD) as its main component is
projected to rise from ’47 million disability-adjusted life-years
in 1990 (DALY = healthy years of life lost) to 82 million DALYs
in 2020 (1). It has been postulated that the consumption of dairy
products inﬂuences the risk of CVD (including CHD and stroke)
or all-cause mortality, but ﬁndings from epidemiologic studies
have been conﬂicting. Several prospective cohort studies have
suggested inverse associations of milk in particular with stroke
(2–5), but also with CHD (3) and all-cause mortality (6).

Whereas other cohort studies reported that milk was positively
associated with CHD (7) or stroke (8). Many studies also re-
ported no signiﬁcant association between milk and CHD (9–13),
stroke (14, 15), or all-cause mortality (16–19). Total dairy intake
was rarely reported (compared with milk) and yielded conﬂict-
ing evidence, with no relation to CHD (20, 21). Meanwhile,
high-fat dairy product consumption has been shown to be pos-
itively related to CHD (22, 23), whereas low-fat dairy product
consumption has been shown to be inversely associated with
CHD (22) or stroke (15).

The mechanisms by which dairy products can exert certain
effects on CVD are diverse, with divergent mechanisms sug-
gesting both positive and negative inﬂuences. Dairy products are
rich in minerals (calcium, potassium, and magnesium), protein
(casein and whey), and vitamins (riboﬂavin and vitamin B-12)
that can exert beneﬁcial effects on CVD. On the other hand,
saturated fat in dairy products can adversely inﬂuence CHD,
although the effect of saturated fat on CHD risk depends on the
source of calories (unsaturated fatty acids or carbohydrates) by
which it is substituted to maintain energy balance (24). There is
some suggestion that low-fat dairy products may beneﬁcially
inﬂuence blood pressure (25, 26). Studies have shown that the
Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) dietary
pattern—which is high in fruit, vegetables, nuts, ﬁsh, and low-fat
dairy products—lowers blood pressure effectively, which may in
part be attributed to its relatively high content of low-fat dairy
products (27). Whether these effects on blood pressure can be
speciﬁcally addressed by low-fat dairy products is not clear from

DAIRY AND CVD META-ANALYSIS

159

DASH, but European guidelines on CVD prevention do rec-
ommend the DASH diet with low-fat dairy products, albeit such
a recommendation is not yet fully evidence-based (28). Two
meta-analyses (29, 30) and 2 narrative reviews (31, 32) combined
with individual studies produced conﬂicting conclusions. Com-
bining evidence from different study designs (ecologic, case-
control, and prospective) and different study populations (age,
sex, country, and various mean milk intakes) may explain the
conﬂicting results. Pooling different exposures (calcium and
milk) and the use of inappropriate statistical methods could also
lead to conﬂicting conclusions.

Therefore, we conducted a new systematic evaluation of the
association between intakes of milk, total dairy products, total
high-fat dairy products, and total low-fat dairy products with risk
of total CVD, CHD, stroke, and all-cause mortality via a dose-
response meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies in healthy
adult men and women.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS

Study selection for the meta-analysis

A systematic literature review was conducted by using the data-
bases PubMed (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed), EMBASE
(http://www.embase.com), and SCOPUS (http://www.scopus.com)
from 10 February 2009 until 1 June 2009, based on the query
syntax shown in supplemental Table 1 (see “Supplemental data”
in the online issue ). An updated secondary search was con-
ducted until 22 February 2010. First, titles of the articles were
screened, on basis of which we excluded animal studies, chil-
dren aged ,18 y, and diseased populations (including diabetes
and CVD). Second, abstracts of the articles were screened for the
following inclusion criteria: prospective cohort studies, original
articles, general population, dairy products as main exposure, and
fatal or nonfatal CVD (CHD and stroke) or mortality outcomes.
For articles that met the inclusion criteria, the full text was re-
trieved. An additional hand search for relevant articles was per-
formed by using bibliographies of scientiﬁc articles (eg, review
articles).

Dairy intake data as well as relative risks (RRs) for CVD,
CHD, stroke, and all-cause mortality (with 95% CIs) were
extracted from the selected articles. If insufﬁcient data were
reported in the article (eg, absence of RRs, CIs, dairy intakes, or
number of cases), additional information was requested from the
authors (7, 14, 20–22). All data were extracted into a predeﬁned
spreadsheet and checked several times. The selection and data
extraction process was executed by 2 independent reviewers
(SSS-M and JMG). If multiple articles were on the same study
sample with the same exposure and outcome [Caerphilly cohort
study (4, 10), Iowa Women’s Health study (9, 23)], only the
publication with the largest number of outcome cases was
retained. In one study population (Oxford Vegetarian Study) (7,
11), because different outcomes were reported in different arti-
cles, both articles on the same study population were included.

Main outcomes

Outcomes in this study included incident major CVD (fatal and
nonfatal CHD and stroke), CHD (fatal and nonfatal), stroke (fatal
and nonfatal), and all-cause mortality, deﬁned as such in the

underlying studies. CVD was deﬁned as CHD or stroke [WHO
International Classiﬁcation of Diseases (ICD)-10 I60-69; http://
www.who.int/classiﬁcations/icd/en] and other CVD, including
cardiac arrest (I46), heart failure (I50), and sudden death (R96).
CHD was deﬁned as acute myocardial infarction, angina pec-
toris, and other ischemic heart disease (as in ICD-10 I20-I25).

Statistical methods

Dairy intakes were converted from servings or other units into
g/d by using standard conversions from the Food Standards
Agency (pint = 585 g; milk, 1 glass = 200 mL; and total dairy =
200 g) (33, 34). Assumptions were made to convert all dairy
exposure data into g/d or for milk into mL/d. For this 1 serving,
dairy products or milk were estimated to be on average 200 g or
200 mL, respectively.

We examined the association between milk consumption and
CVD, CHD, stroke, and all-cause mortality. Because there were
insufﬁcient numbers of studies for dairy products and outcomes
other than CHD, we analyzed total dairy, total low-fat dairy, and
total high-fat dairy products only for CHD risk. There were
insufﬁcient numbers of studies (2) including certain exposures,
such as cheese, yogurt, and high-fat or low-fat milk; therefore,
these analyses could not be pursued.

Only studies with similar exposures and outcomes were pooled
to avoid heterogeneity, according to a predeﬁned data-analysis plan.
We used STATA version 11.0 (StataCorp, College Station, TX)
for meta-analysis using the METAN command, whereas dose-
response meta-analyses were conducted by using the GLST
command with the generalized least-squares method for trend
estimation of summarized dose-response data, based on the
Greenland and Longnecker method (35). All statistical tests
were 2-sided with a = 0.05. Restricted cubic splines were used to
assess for potential curvilinear relations.

Between-study heterogeneity was assessed via the I2 statistic
(36), which expresses the percentage of variation attributable to
between-study heterogeneity. Random-effects pooling were con-
ducted by using DerSimonian and Laird random-effects models
(37). Forest plots were made for the relation between milk or
dairy and CVD, CHD, stroke, and all-cause mortality. From each
publication, we used the results from the main multivariable
model that included most confounders. Subgroup analyses were
performed by sex, age (young compared with old), continent, and
degree of adjustment for confounding, providing sufﬁcient num-
bers of studies. For year of publication and BMI, variation was
insufﬁcient across studies to conduct subgroup analyses. To assess
whether studies of lesser quality could have inﬂuenced the results,
meta-analyses were split by categorizing studies by whether or
not they adjusted for the most essential confounders (age, sex,
BMI, smoking, and total energy intake). Most of the associations
were not adjusted for physical activity or other aspects of diet,
including intakes of fruit and vegetables and speciﬁc fatty acids;
therefore, these could not be included.

To explore heterogeneity with a statistical test, further meta-
regression analyses were performed to relate the size of effect to
one or more characteristics (age, sex, and confounder adjustments)
of the studies involved. In addition, interaction terms were added,
and statistical signiﬁcance was evaluated. For the analysis on total
mortality, which included most studies (n = 8), we used a funnel
plot to assess the presence of publication bias. In addition, we

tested for publication bias with the Begg’s test (38). A spaghetti
plot, developed by Ding (ELD), was used to illustrate the di-
rection of the association between milk and all-cause mortality.

RESULTS

Study populations

We identiﬁed a total of 87 articles from PubMed, 40 from
EMBASE, and 22 from SCOPUS (Figure 1). In the full-text
stage, we narrowed the number of studies from 27 to 17 after
applying our search criteria. Nine studies were excluded because
of insufﬁcient data on dairy intakes or if RRs or 95% CIs could
not be extracted (2, 12, 13, 19, 39–43). One study (23) was
excluded because the same analyses were already included in an
earlier larger study of the same population (9). A total of 17
studies were included, the study characteristics of which are
presented in Table 1 (3, 5–11, 14–18, 20–22, 44). The mean (6
SD) age of the study populations included was 56 6 13 y (range:
34–80 y) for a total of 611,430 participants across 17 studies,
and the mean (6 SD) duration of follow-up was 14.0 6 6.0 y.
Five studies were conducted in the United States, 2 in Japan, and
10 in Europe. The mean BMI (in kg/m2) was 25, as reported in
11 (65%) studies. The studies were pooled to assess milk intake
according to the outcomes: 8 studies on all-cause mortality, 6
studies on CHD, 6 studies on stroke, and 4 studies on CVD
outcomes (see supplemental Table 2 under “Supplemental data”
in the online issue). The intake range for milk across all studies
was 0–850 mL/d, with a mean (6 SD) intake of 266 6 210 mL/d.
For total dairy products and CHD, 4 studies were pooled; for total
high-fat dairy products and CHD, 4 studies were pooled; and for
total low-fat dairy products and CHD, 3 studies were pooled (see
supplemental Table 3 under “Supplemental data” in the online
issue). The mean (6 SD) intake for total dairy products across the
4 studies was 419 6 215 g/d (range: 114–828 g/d).

Total CVD

Data from a total of 13,518 participants and 2283 CVD (fatal
and nonfatal) cases were analyzed in 4 prospective cohort studies,
with milk as the main exposure. The mean (6SD) age was 55 6
8 y. Two studies comprised only men, and 2 studies had a similar
distribution of men and women; the mean (6 SD) follow-up was
16 6 9 y. The mean (6SD) milk intake across these 4 studies
was 313 6 214 mL/d. Pooled results indicated an inverse as-
sociation between milk and total CVD risk (RR: 0.94; 95% CI:
0.89, 0.99) per glass (200 mL/d) (Figure 2), with no evidence of
between-study heterogeneity (I2 = 0%, P = 0.5). From a strati-
ﬁed analysis, effect-modiﬁcation heterogeneity was suggestive
for sex and degree of confounding, albeit not statistically sig-
niﬁcant (P for interaction . 0.05). An inverse association be-
tween milk and CVD was shown in studies that included only
men (RR: 0.93; 95% CI: 0.87, 0.99), and no association was
shown in studies that included both men and women (RR: 1.10;
95% CI: 0.67, 1.80). By degree of confounding, studies that used
full adjustment showed an inverse association between milk and
CVD (RR: 0.94; 95% CI: 0.88, 1.01), whereas studies that did
not use full adjustment showed no association (RR: 1.10; 95%
CI: 0.66, 1.84).

CHD

Data from a total of 259,162 participants and 4391 CHD
(fatal and nonfatal) cases were analyzed in 6 prospective cohort
studies, with milk as the main exposure. The mean (6SD) age
was 50 6 11 y. Three studies included only men, 2 studies
included 40% men and 60% women, and 1 study included
only women; the mean (6SD) follow-up was 16 6 6 y. The
mean milk intake was 263 mL/d (range: 0–659 mL/d) for these
6 studies. The pooled results from these 6 studies (Figure 3)
with CHD outcomes suggested no association between milk

FIGURE 2. Relation between milk (per 200 mL/d) and cardiovascular disease: dose-response meta-analyses of 4 prospective cohort studies (n = 13,518, no.
of cases = 2283). Shown are author names, reference number, year of publication, country of study, and the size of the association per study expressed in
squares (size of square indicates weight of the study to the overall meta-analysis); the horizontal lines indicate 95% CIs. The last 2 columns contain the actual
estimated relative risks (RRs) and 95% CIs pooled across the categories of milk exposure with the generalized least-squares method and the actual weights. On
the x axis, the RR is plotted with a line through the RR (= 1) that indicates no signiﬁcant association between exposure and outcome. The diamond at the
bottom indicates the pooled result, with the RR in the middle and the 95% CI. A test for heterogeneity, the Higgins and Thompson I-squared value, shows how
much heterogeneity is due to between-study variation with a P value (if P , 0.05).

(per 200 mL/d) and CHD (RR: 1.00; 95% CI: 0.96, 1.04).
There was no evidence of between-study heterogeneity in
these analyses (I2 = 27%, P = 0.2). From stratiﬁed analyses by
continent, differences were found between the studies in the
United States (n = 2) and those in Europe (n = 4), with RRs of
1.03 (95% CI: 0.99, 1.08) and 0.96 (95% CI: 0.92, 1.02),
respectively, which were not signiﬁcant (P = 0.3). No sig-
niﬁcant effect modiﬁcation for age (P for interaction = 0.8),
sex (P for interaction = 0.4), or degree of confounding (fully
compared with not fully adjusted; P for interaction = 0.6) was
seen.

Pooled results from a limited number of studies on the as-
sociation between total dairy (n = 4), total high-fat (n = 4), and
total low-fat (n = 3) dairy consumption and CHD risk showed no
signiﬁcant association between total dairy product intake and

nonlinear relations via restricted cubic spline functions, but

Stroke

Data from a total of 375,381 participants and 15,554 fatal and
nonfatal stroke cases were analyzed in 6 prospective cohort
studies, with milk as the main exposure. The mean (6SD) age
was 52 6 5 y. Most of the studies consisted of men, and the
mean (6 SD) follow-up was 18 6 5 y. The mean milk intake
over these 6 studies was 219 mL/d (range: 0–850 mL/d). The
most recent study, by Larsson et al (8), presented the results of

high-fat and low-fat milk separately and did not have data on
total milk. Two separate meta-analyses were carried out, in-
cluding either the low-fat or high-fat milk results of Larsson et al
(8). The pooled estimate of all studies (Figure 4) with Larsson
et al’s high-fat milk data suggested an inverse association, but it
was not statistically signiﬁcant (RR: 0.87; 95% CI: 0.72, 1.07).
The pooled estimate for the studies including Larsson et al’s
low-fat milk data showed similar results (RR: 0.87; 95% CI:

0.72, 1.05). However, signiﬁcant between-study heterogeneity
was observed in these analyses (I2 = 95%, P , 0.0001). From
a stratiﬁed analysis, effect modiﬁcation was suggested for sex
and degree of confounding, with an inverse association between
milk and stroke in studies that included mostly women (RR:
0.88; 95% CI: 0.78, 1.01; I2 = 0%, P = 0.9) and no association in
studies that included men (RR: 1.02; 95% CI: 0.99, 1.051; I2 =
0%, P = 0.3), albeit not statistically signiﬁcant (P for interaction =
0.24). By degree of confounding, studies that used full adjustment
showed no association between milk and stroke (RR: 1.03; 95%
CI: 0.99, 1.05; I2 = 0%, P = 0.3) and studies that did not use full
adjustment showed an inverse association (RR: 0.83; 95% CI:
0.68, 1.013; I2 = 85%, P , 0.0001), which, again, was not sta-
tistically signiﬁcant (P for interaction = 0.9).

All-cause mortality

Data from a total of 62,779 participants and 23,949 all-cause
mortality cases were analyzed in 8 observational prospective
cohort studies, with milk as the main exposure. The mean (6 SD)
age was 61 6 17 y. Two studies consisted of only men, and the
other studies combined both men and women; the mean duration
of follow-up was 16 6 7 y. The mean milk intake over these 8
studies was 278 mL/d (range: 0–659 mL/d). The pooled estimate
of these 8 studies (Figure 5) indicated no signiﬁcant association
between milk intake per 200 mL/d and all-cause mortality (RR:
0.99; 95% CI: 0.95, 1.03). There was signiﬁcant between-study
heterogeneity in these analyses (I2 = 72%, P = 0.001). From
a stratiﬁed analysis, no effect modiﬁcation was seen by sex or
degree of confounding. When studies were stratiﬁed by mean
age, studies with a lower mean age (55 y) suggested a bor-
derline inverse association (RR: 0.94; 95% CI: 0.89, 1.01), with
the I2 value decreasing from 72% to 38% (P = 0.2). In studies
with an older mean age (.55 y), no association was found for
milk (RR: 1.02; 95% CI: 0.96, 1.09; I2 = 70%, P = 0.02), albeit
the overall P value for effect modiﬁcation by mean age was 0.8.
Ding’s spaghetti plot illustrates for each study (8 studies with
categories of milk intake) the direction of the association be-
tween milk and all-cause mortality (see supplemental Figure 4
under “Supplemental data” in the online issue). Most studies

show a ﬂat (horizontal) line, which indicates no association with
all-cause mortality.

Assessment of publication bias

The funnel plot, as shown in Figure 6, shows reasonable
symmetry and a nonsigniﬁcant Begg’s test for publication bias
(P = 0.11), which suggested no evidence of publication bias in
studies of milk and all-cause mortality.

DISCUSSION

This meta-analysis indicates the challenges of summarizing
data on food intake from published studies. Although 17 studies
with data on dairy foods were identiﬁed, only 4 studies (repre-
senting only ’5% of the total number of subjects) provided data
on milk intake and risk of CVD in a manner that could be
summarized statistically. A weak and marginally signiﬁcant in-
verse association was seen between milk intake and total CVD,
but no signiﬁcant association was seen with risk of stroke or
CHD. In 8 studies, risk of total mortality could be examined, and
no association was observed with milk intake. Data on total
dairy product and total high-fat and low-fat dairy product in-
takes did not indicate any association with incident CHD, but
these results were based on very limited numbers of studies.

Strengths and limitations of the meta-analysis

Several

issues warrant

limited studies were available;

further discussion. We aimed at
avoiding heterogeneity by including prospective cohort studies
and stratifying by type of dairy product and disease outcomes.
However,
therefore, splitting
results into high- and low-fat dairy products was only possible for
CHD. Heterogeneity was present for the all-cause mortality and
stroke analyses, which were only partly explained in subgroup
analyses. A signiﬁcant association with a narrow CI between milk
and CVD and not for stroke was found, even with a larger sample
size in the stroke meta-analyses. This difference could be
explained by the larger statistical heterogeneity in the underlying
6 studies with stroke outcomes than for the 4 studies with CVD
outcomes, as evident by the result of the Higgins and Thompson
test for heterogeneity, which was signiﬁcant for stroke but not for
CVD.

However, a notable strength of our methodology was the use of
an advanced statistical approach for trend estimation of sum-
marized dose-response data, which not only offers uniform
analysis of different studies by different exposure categories and
analysis of studies across different ranges of intake, but it also
offers greater power using the full spectrum of continuous ex-
posure data (35). A limitation of this meta-analysis regarding the
exposure data are that each study expressed dairy consumption in
different units (pints, frequency/wk, times/d, and servings/wk),
and assumptions about what a serving is had to be made to
convert values into g/d (or mL/d).

The results were consistent across studies with different
degrees of adjustment for confounding; however, this did not rule
out residual confounding (other aspects of diet) within each study,
which still remained possible.

Although no publication bias was found for all-cause mor-
tality, the power to detect publication bias was low given the
limited number of studies. Finally, although we excluded some

smaller the SE, the larger the study. The RRs are plotted on the x axis.
The lines are drawn around the dots to visualize how symmetrically the
studies are divided around the true estimate; symmetry indicates no
evidence of publication bias.

DAIRY AND CVD META-ANALYSIS

studies on the basis of insufﬁcient data (2, 12, 13, 19, 39–43) for
reasons such as no range of intake for the exposures (dairy
products and milk), the availability of only calcium data, no
reported RR, or no CIs, all of these studies had indicated either no
association or were similarly suggestive of an inverse association
for CVD. Therefore, we would have expected similar ﬁndings
and conclusions if we had included these studies.

Studies included in the meta-analysis

In the underlying studies, diet was measured with a validated
food-frequency questionnaire, which was based on self reported
intake. This might have caused misclassiﬁcation of dairy intake,
which could have weakened the associations. The advantage of
food-frequency questionnaires is that food consumption of a past
longer-term period is measured, which is relevant for chronic
diseases (45). Diet was measured at the start of the studies. The
participants might have changed their dairy product intake during
the follow-up period, especially because many new dairy products
(especially fermented dairy products) became available over the
past decades. This would be interesting to address in future
prospective cohort studies by using multiple exposure assess-
ments over time.

Conclusions from this meta-analysis only apply to the small
proportion of analyzable study populations included in this work,
within milk intakes of ’200–600 mL/d (see supplemental Table
2 under “Supplemental data” in the online issue). Moreover, the
internal validity of the different studies included in the meta-
analysis (eg, methodology and confounding factors) also de-
termines the quality of the present meta-analysis. Therefore, we
recommend to investigators of future prospective observational
studies to carefully report on all information needed for a meta-
analysis, such as the number of cases, exposure ranges, RR (95%
CI), units in g/d, categories of different types of dairy products,
and details on study population and confounders. Many of these
shortcomings could be overcome by pooling the primary data
from all available cohort studies (24). Ideally, a randomized
clinical trial would demonstrate more clearly whether an asso-
ciation between milk and CVD or all-cause mortality exists.
Several small trials showed no beneﬁts of milk or dairy products
on the metabolic syndrome (46) or blood pressure change (47,
48). In our opinion, evidence of a recommendation to increase
milk consumption or to alter guidelines is rather weak because
no CVD outcomes were studied, and no clear effects on CVD
risk factors were found. Larger trials are needed with well-
documented cardiovascular endpoints, although these may be
impossible to conduct (concerning resources, long-term com-
pliance, and separating effects of milk from diet).

Comparison of the presents results with those in the
literature

A very recent publication by the Nurses’ Health Study inves-
tigators (49) showed an inverse association between low-fat dairy
product intake and CHD with 26 y of follow-up, but no association
with high-fat dairy product
intake. After updating our meta-
analyses, our conclusions did not change. In more detail, we showed
with these new data no signiﬁcant associations between high-fat
(RR: 1.05 per 200 g/d; 95% CI: 0.93, 1.19) and low-fat (RR: 1.01
per 200 g/d; 95% CI: 0.95, 1.08) dairy product intake and CHD.

The previously reported stronger inverse associations between
milk and dairy product intake and CHD (RR: 0.92; 95% CI: 0.80,
0.99) and stroke (RR: 0.79; 95% CI: 0.68, 0.91) and all-cause
mortality (RR: 0.87; 95% CI: 0.77, 0.98) in meta-analyses were
not conﬁrmed by our data (29, 30). In these meta-analyses,
highest compared with lowest dairy exposure results were pooled,
which is a more crude (less precise) method for meta-analyses
than is our dose-response methodology. Lack of formal assess-
ment of heterogeneity (assessed via statistical methods but also
predeﬁned by which studies should be included or excluded) and
pooling together different exposures (calcium and milk) and
combining outcomes may have led to the difference in results.
Furthermore, 2 recent narrative reviews (31, 32) on the associ-
ation between dairy product intake and CHD included 12 pro-
spective cohort studies. Eight of the 12 studies were conducted
during or before 1970, when almost only whole milk high in
saturated fat was available, and they concluded that there was no
clear evidence that dairy food consumption is related to a higher
risk of CVD. In our meta-analyses, most of the studies measured
diet during the 1980s (Table 1). It could be that whole-fat milk
was mainly consumed in these studies because semi-skim prod-
ucts were introduced in the late 1980s, but speciﬁc information on
this is lacking.

Possible underlying mechanisms

Several mechanisms may explain an inverse association be-
tween milk and CVD; the most plausible ones will be discussed.
The weak and marginally signiﬁcant inverse association that we
found for dairy intake in relation to CVD may have been due to
beneﬁcial effects on blood pressure (25, 26). With the DASH diet,
reductions in systolic blood pressure of 5 mm Hg were found
compared with the control diet, ’50% of which could possibly
be ascribed to intake of low-fat dairy products (27). However,
this effect on blood pressure is not supported by randomized
trials that used consumption of low-fat dairy products as the
intervention (47, 48). Guidelines do recommend healthy nutri-
tion with consumption of low-fat dairy products to prevent CVD
based on the DASH trial, but whether this effect on CVD is due
to dairy product intake is not yet proven in our opinion (28).

Milk minerals, especially calcium and potassium, might be
responsible for an antihypertensive effect (50, 51). A recent study
also described dairy phosphorus as a major blood pressure–
lowering mineral (52).

On the other hand, dairy products contain saturated fat that
could affect the blood lipid proﬁle and promote atherosclerosis
and CVD. A recent meta-analysis of 21 prospective cohort
studies showed that the harmful effects of saturated fat on CHD
have become controversial (53); however, in our opinion, this
is not true. It depends on what substitutions for saturated fat
have taken place, because they have different effects on risk of
CHD (54).

Associations between dairy products and other health
outcomes

In 2007 the World Cancer Research Fund team conducted
several systematic reviews on the relation between dairy products
and cancer (34). They concluded that there was no association
between milk and dairy products and cancers of, for example, the

lung, stomach, and breast. Higher consumption of milk and dairy
products was suggested to increase the risk of prostate cancer (34,
55). On the contrary, there was also suggestive evidence of an
inverse association between milk intake and colon cancer (56)
and possibly bladder cancer. For other health outcomes such as
Parkinson disease, dairy products may increase its risk (57).
Furthermore, the risk of hip or bone fractures does not seem to be
associated with higher consumption of dairy products (58, 59). In
summary, evidence from the literature on other health outcomes
does not really support strong recommendations of increasing
intakes of milk and dairy products.

Overall, this study showed no association between milk and
total mortality, but modest inverse associations with CVD. Milk
and dairy products cannot be recommended to beneﬁt CVD
health outcomes on the basis of this dose-response meta-analysis.
Intake of milk and dairy products does not seem to be harmful,
but whether the association is truly inverse cannot be ﬁrmly
concluded. Further studies are warranted to investigate the relation
between consumption of dairy products and risk of CVD and to
investigate different dairy components separately with sufﬁcient
follow-up to assess multiple health outcomes.

Abstract
A number of prospective cohort studies have investigated the associations between consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB) and
the risk of hypertension, CHD and stroke, but revealed mixed results. In the present study, we aimed to perform a dose –response meta-
analysis of these prospective studies to clarify these associations. A systematic literature search was conducted using the PubMed and
Embase databases up to 5 May 2014. Random- or ﬁxed-effects models were used to calculate the pooled relative risks (RR) with 95 %
CI for the highest compared with the lowest category of SSB consumption, and to conduct a dose –response analysis. A total of six pro-
spective studies (240 726 participants and 80 411 incident cases of hypertension) from four publications on hypertension were identiﬁed.
A total of four prospective studies (194 664 participants and 7396 incident cases of CHD) from four publications on CHD were identiﬁed.
A total of four prospective studies (259 176 participants and 10 011 incident cases of stroke) from four publications on stroke were
identiﬁed. The summary RR for incident hypertension was 1·08 (95 % CI 1·04, 1·12) for every additional one serving/d increase in SSB
consumption. The summary RR for incident CHD was 1·17 (95 % CI 1·10, 1·24) for every serving/d increase in SSB consumption. There
was no signiﬁcant association between SSB consumption and total stroke (summary RR 1·06, 95 % CI 0·97, 1·15) for every serving/d
increase in SSB consumption. The present meta-analysis suggested that a higher consumption of SSB was associated with a higher risk
of hypertension and CHD, but not with a higher risk of stroke.

Key words: Sugar-sweetened beverages: Hypertension: CHD: Stroke: Meta-analysis

Consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB), including
soft drinks, fruit drinks,
iced tea, and energy and vitamin
water drinks, has increased in the USA and Europe over the
three decades(1). A higher consumption of SSB has
past
been associated with weight gain, obesity(2), the metabolic

syndrome and diabetes(3), which may be attributed to their
high energy and sugar content and lack of nutrients.

To date, a few studies have investigated the associations
between SSB consumption and the risk of hypertension, CHD
and stroke(4 – 13). However, the results have been inconsistent,

with some reporting a positive association and others ﬁnding no
relationship. Although two recent systematic reviews(14,15) have
commented on the associations of SSB consumption with the
risk of CVD and hypertension, they did not quantify the associ-
ations using a meta-analysis. Thus, it is still unclear whether SSB
consumption is associated with cardiovascular risk.

In the present study, we performed a systematic review and
meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies to clarify the
dose – response associations between SSB consumption and
the risk of hypertension, CHD and stroke.

Materials and methods

Literature and search strategy

The Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology
guidelines were followed for the present study(16). A literature
search was performed using databases including PubMed
and Embase. The search terms included ‘sugar-sweetened
beverages’ (or ‘soft drink’ or ‘soft drinks’ or ‘beverage’ or ‘bev-
erages’ or ‘carbonated soft drinks’ or ‘fruitades’ or ‘fruit drinks’
or ‘sports drinks’ or ‘energy and vitamin water drinks’ or
‘sweetened iced tea’ or ‘punch’ or ‘fruit punch’ or ‘cordials’
or ‘squashes’ or ‘lemonade’ or ‘soda’ or ‘soda-pop’); ‘hyperten-
sion’ (or ‘HBP’ or ‘high blood pressure’ or ‘blood pressure’);
‘coronary heart disease’ (or ‘CHD’ or ‘angina’ or ‘ischemic
heart disease’ or ‘IHD’ or ‘myocardial ischemia’ or ‘myocardial
infarction’ or ‘MI’ or ‘coronary artery disease’ or ‘atherosclero-
sis’ or ‘cardiovascular disease’ or ‘CVD’ or ‘vascular disease’
or ‘vascular event’); ‘stroke’ (or ‘ischemic stroke’ or ‘cerebral
infarction’ or ‘cerebrovascular disease’); and ‘prospective’ (or
‘cohort’ or ‘follow up’ or ‘following’ or ‘longitudinal’ or ‘inci-
dence’). The search strategy is given in detail in the online
Supplementary material. The search was limited to studies
carried out in human subjects only. The reference lists of
retrieved articles were also screened. The literature search
was limited to the English language. If more than one article
was published on the same cohort, only the study with the
largest sample size was included. The literature search was
updated on 5 May 2014.

Inclusion criteria and data extraction

Studies included in the meta-analysis met all the following
inclusion criteria: (1) evaluated any association between SSB
consumption and the risk of hypertension, CHD or stroke;
(2) used a prospective cohort design; (3) provided the
amount of SSB consumption, distributions of cases and
person-years, and relative risks (RR) or hazard ratios (HR)
with 95 % CI for at least three exposure categories. The follow-
ing information was extracted from each study: (1) name of
the ﬁrst author; (2) year of publication; (3) country of study;
(4) sex of participants; (5) age distribution of the study popu-
lation at baseline; (6) average duration of
follow-up; (7)
number of cases and study population; (8) outcome; (9) RR
or HR with 95 % CI for all categories of SSB consumption;
(10) covariates used in adjustment. To assess the compliance
with the inclusion/exclusion criteria, two authors (B. X. and

D. Z.) independently searched and assessed the abstracts
and full-text articles. If there was a discrepancy in the screen-
ing decision, a third investigator was asked to discuss and
resolve it.

The quality of each study was assessed by the Newcastle –
Ottawa quality scale (see online Supplementary Table S1)(17),
which is a validated scale for non-randomised studies in
meta-analyses. This scale assigned a maximum of nine points
for each study. The following three broad perspectives are
considered: selection of cohorts (four points); comparability
of cohorts (two points); ascertainment of the exposure and
outcome of interest (three points).

Statistical analyses

Fixed-effects(18) or random-effects(19) models, selected on the
basis of whether there was a between-study heterogeneity,
were used to calculate the pooled RR with 95 % CI for the
highest compared with the lowest category of SSB consump-
tion. Dose –response analyses were also conducted. The Q
test and the I 2 statistic(20) were used to examine between-
study heterogeneity. P,0·10 for the Q test or I 2 . 50 %
represented signiﬁcant heterogeneity, and random-effects
models were used when signiﬁcant heterogeneity was pre-
sent; otherwise, ﬁxed-effects models were used.

The generalised least-squares trend estimation, reported by
Greenland & Longnecker(21) and Orsini et al.(22), was used to
calculate study-speciﬁc slopes (linear trends) for the dose –
response analyses based on the results across the categories
of SSB consumption. We extracted data on the amount of
SSB consumption, the distribution of cases and person-years,
and RR with 95 % CI for at least three categories of exposure
to SSB. The deﬁnition of the median or mean level of SSB
consumption in each category of the included studies has
been described elsewhere(23). The dose – response results in
the forest plots are presented for every one serving/d incre-
ment in SSB consumption. Doses reported as servings/week
(or month) were converted to servings/d. For example, one
serving/week is equal to 1/7, which is approximately 0·143
servings/d. Doses reported as cups/d (or week or month)
were treated as servings/d (or week or month), although
this may introduce some small degree of inaccuracy. A four-
knot restricted cubic spline model was applied to obtain
three spline transformations of aggregated SSB intakes. Then,
the restricted cubic spline model was nested within the
generalised least-squares trend model to obtain the P value
for non-linearity. We tested the joint null hypothesis that the
regression coefﬁcients of the last two spline transformations
were all equal to zero(22,24). If the test for the non-linear
association was not signiﬁcant, the simple generalised least-
squares trend model without
the restricted cubic spline
model was used to test the linear hypothesis.

To examine the stability of the present results, we performed
inﬂuence analysis by exclusion of one study at a time. Meta-
regression analyses were used to examine the potential sources
of heterogeneity between studies. Begg’s test(25) and Egger’s
test(26) were used to examine publication bias. P, 0·05

Results

Characteristics of the included prospective studies

The results of the literature search are shown in Fig. 1. If the
original publications provided several
independent studies,
they were considered as separate studies in the following
data analysis. The duration of follow-up ranged from 6 to 38
years for hypertension, 10 to 24 years for CHD, and 10 to 28
years for stroke. The characteristics of the included prospec-
tive studies are listed in Table 1 and online Supplementary
Table S1.

Sugar-sweetened beverage consumption and risk of
hypertension

Highest v. lowest intake

A total of six prospective studies from four publications,
including 240 726 participants and 80 411 incident cases of
hypertension, were included in the meta-analysis. The highest
intake of SSB was positively associated with the risk of hyper-
tension (random-effects model: RR 1·10, 95 % CI 1·06, 1·15,
P, 0·001; Fig. 2(a)) compared with the lowest
level, with
signiﬁcant evidence of heterogeneity (I 2 ¼ 46·7 %, P¼0·095).
In the sensitivity analyses, RR were stable, ranging from 1·11

Dose –response analysis

The test for the non-linear association between SSB consumption
and the risk of hypertension was not signiﬁcant (P for non-
linearity¼0·22; Fig. 3(a)). Under the linear hypothesis, a higher
consumption of SSB was signiﬁcantly associated with an increased
risk of hypertension (summary RR 1·08, 95 % CI 1·04, 1·12). An
increase in one serving/d was associated with a higher risk of
developing hypertension (P for trend ,0·05).

Sugar-sweetened beverage consumption and risk of CHD

A total of four prospective studies from four publications,
including 194 664 participants and 7396 incident cases of
CHD, were included in the meta-analysis. An apparent signiﬁ-
cant association between SSB intake and the risk of CHD was
found (RR 1·16, 95 % CI 1·06, 1·27) for the highest compared
with the lowest consumption of SSB in the ﬁxed-effects
model (P, 0·001; Fig. 2(b)), with no evidence of heterogeneity
(I 2 ¼ 0 %, P¼ 0·792). These results were stable after excluding
each study at one time, with RR ranging from 1·13 (95 % CI
0·94, 1·35) to 1·18 (95 % CI 1·07, 1·30). There was no evidence
of publication bias as revealed by Begg’s test (P¼ 0·31) and
Egger’s test (P¼0·30).

was signiﬁcantly associated with an increased risk of CHD. For
example, one serving/d increase in SSB consumption rela-
tively increased the risk of developing CHD by 17 % (RR
1·17, 95 % CI 1·10, 1·24, P for trend , 0·001).

Sugar-sweetened beverage consumption and risk of stroke

A total of four prospective studies from four publications, inclu-
ding 259 176 participants and 10 011 incident cases of stroke,
were included in the meta-analysis. The highest intake of SSB
was marginally associated with the risk of total stroke (ﬁxed-
effects model: RR 1·10, 95 % CI 1·00, 1·20, P,0·05; Fig. 2(c)) com-
pared with the lowest level, with little evidence of heterogeneity
(I 2 ¼ 43·4 %, P¼0·151). However, these results were not stable
after exclusion of each study at one time, with RR ranging from
1·07 (95 % CI 0·95, 1·20) to 1·17 (95 % CI 1·06, 1·28). There was
no evidence of publication bias as revealed by Begg’s test
(P¼0·31) and Egger’s test (P¼0·38).

The subgroup analysis by types of stroke suggested that
there were no signiﬁcant associations between SSB intake
and the risk of either ischaemic stroke (RR 1·16, 95 % CI
0·93, 1·46) or haemorrhagic stroke (RR 0·86, 95 % CI 0·71,
1·04). However, SSB intake was associated with a higher risk
of stroke in Caucasians (RR 1·17, 95 % CI 1·06, 1·28), but not
in East Asians (RR 0·92, 95 % CI 0·75, 1·13).

Dose– response analysis

The test for the non-linear association was not signiﬁcant
(P for non-linearity¼0·82; Fig. 3(c)). There was no signiﬁcant
association between SSB consumption and the risk of stroke
(summary RR 1·06, 95 % CI 0·97, 1·15, P for trend . 0·05).

Between-study heterogeneity

To examine the potential sources of heterogeneity between the
included studies for hypertension outcome, meta-regression
analyses were performed with the following independent
variables: sex; age; origin of country; sample size of the
studies; mean BMI; mean age of the populations; whether
adjustment for confounders was made or not; sex proportion
of the participants; length of follow-up; study quality. How-
ever, none of these variables was identiﬁed as a relevant
source of heterogeneity, suggesting that other unknown or
unmeasured factors might be responsible for the observed
heterogeneity in the association between SSB intake and the
risk of hypertension.

Discussion

To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst quantitative meta-analysis
investigating the association between SSB consumption and
the risk of hypertension, CHD and stroke. In the present
meta-analysis, a higher consumption of SSB was associated
with an increased risk of hypertension and CHD, but not
with the risk of stroke. These observed associations were
independent of dietary and lifestyle factors, such as BMI or
energy intake.

Comparison with other studies

Several meta-analyses have addressed the association between
SSB consumption and the risk of obesity(2,27), the metabolic
syndrome, type 2 diabetes(3), pancreatic cancer(28) and colon
cancer(29). Because SSB include high energy and sugar
content,
it is not surprising that SSB consumption may be

signiﬁcantly associated with an increased risk of obesity and
weight gain, as shown in prospective studies and randomised
controlled trials, respectively(2). In another meta-analysis, a
higher consumption of SSB was associated with an increased
risk of type 2 diabetes(3). However, available evidence in
two meta-analyses suggests that a higher consumption of
SSB is not associated with either pancreatic(28) or colon
cancer(29).

Less attention has been paid to the association between SSB
consumption and cardiovascular risk, such as CHD or stroke.
A recent meta-analysis of the association between SSB intake
and the risk of CHD conducted by Huang et al.(30) included
the same studies, and demonstrated the same strength of the
association. However,
that meta-analysis did not address
whether SSB consumption is associated with the risk of hyper-
tension and stroke. For hypertension, Dhingra et al.(4)
reported that consumption of $ 1 serving of soft drink per d
was not signiﬁcantly associated with an increased risk of
higher blood pressure (BP; RR 1·18, 95 % CI 0·96, 1·44).
However, in a subsequent study, Cohen et al.(6) found that
participants who consumed $1 serving/d had an adjusted
HR for incident hypertension of 1·13 (95 % CI 1·09, 1·17) com-
pared with those who did not consume SSB. Furthermore, the
PREMIER Study (an 18-month behavioural intervention trial)
conducted by Chen et al.(31) has suggested that after control-
ling for potential confounders, each 1 serving/d reduction
in SSB consumption was associated with a 1·8 mmHg (95 %
CI 1·2, 2·4) reduction in systolic BP and 1·1 mmHg (95 %
CI 0·7, 1·4) reduction in diastolic BP. This association did not
substantially change after
for weight
change over the same period. The different ﬁndings on the
association between SSB intake and the risk of hypertension,
CHD and stroke might be due to biological mechanisms or to
other reasons (study population, design, sample size or other
factors). Based on the present meta-analysis of prospective
studies, each additional 1 serving/d increase in SSB consump-
tion was associated with a 8 and 17 % relative increase in the
risk of incident hypertension and CHD, respectively. In the
present meta-analysis, we did not ﬁnd any signiﬁcant
association between SSB consumption and the risk of incident
stroke, although a signiﬁcant association was found in studies
conducted in Caucasians. Currently, convincing reasons for
the absence of any signiﬁcant association in the total popu-
lation but ﬁnding an association only in some ethnic sub-
groups are unknown. It is possible that genetic factors may
play some role in the association of SSB intake with the risk
of stroke.

further adjustment

The association between artiﬁcially sweetened beverage
(ASB) intake and the risk of CVD has already been reviewed
by Pereira(32) who reported that ASB intake may increase
the risk of CVD; however, there could be a reverse causality
bias because obese individuals may tend to preferentially con-
sume ASB in order to reduce their weight gain and are also
more likely to develop CVD. Furthermore, evidence from
experimental studies supports that replacing SSB with ASB
may be beneﬁcial to decrease the risk of obesity.

Mechanisms

The effect of BMI and total energy intake could not fully
explain the positive association between SSB consumption
and the risk of incident hypertension or CHD, since both
potential mediators have been controlled for in the majority
of the included studies. Fructose, one of the major sweeteners
in SSB, has been suggested to result in acute and chronic
elevations of serum uric acid concentration, thereby leading
to the activation of the renin – angiotensin system and, conse-
quently, acute endothelial dysfunction, renal microvascular
alteration and chronic Na retention(33). This mechanism may
explain why SSB consumption could increase the risk of inci-
dent hypertension. With respect to the observed association
between SSB consumption and the risk of CHD, fructose has
been found to increase the levels of several circulating inﬂam-
matory factors, such as C-reactive protein, IL-6, TNF receptor 1
and TNF receptor superfamily, which are known to inﬂuence
atherosclerosis, plaque stability and thrombosis, and are key
factors in the pathogenesis of CVD(34). Fructose has also
been associated with increased insulin resistance, reduced
HDL-cholesterol, higher visceral fat stores and higher TAG
concentrations, as well as with reduced endothelial NO pro-
duction. All
these changes have been associated with a
higher risk of CHD(5,8).

Strengths and limitations

the large sample size,

The strengths of the present study included the prospective
study design,
the long duration of
follow-up and adjustment for many dietary and lifestyle factors
in the included studies. However, several limitations should
be considered. First, because of the observational nature of
these studies,
the possibility of residual and unmeasured
confounding may have inﬂuenced the results. Second, errors
may exist in measuring SSB consumption using FFQ since
accuracy is dependent on an individual’s memory and report-
ing. However, misclassiﬁcation is usually non-differential and,
thus, more likely to lead to an underestimation of the associ-
ation. Third, all the studies used SSB consumption at baseline
as exposure, and it is possible that participants may have
changed their beverage habits during the follow-up period.
Fourth, the majority of the included participants were white
Americans. This limits the generalisability of our ﬁndings
to other ethnic populations. Fifth, only several prospective
studies were included for each outcome; however, the sample
sizes of total incident cases were large enough (n . 6000)
and sufﬁcient statistical power was available. Sixth, different
criteria were used to deﬁne the outcomes. For hypertension,
some studies used self-reported hypertension(6), whereas
others used systolic BP/diastolic BP $ 130/85 mmHg(4,5,7).
However,
the signiﬁcant association remained in each
subgroup (RR 1·09, 95 % CI 1·06, 1·13 for studies using self-
reported hypertension; RR 1·04, 95 % CI 1·01, 1·08 for studies
using systolic BP/diastolic BP $ 130/85 mmHg). With respect
to the endpoints of CHD and stroke, the deﬁnitions were simi-
lar for each outcome (mostly via medical records). Seventh,
dietary assessment errors (e.g. FFQ) affect the accuracy of

the estimated ‘doses’. Additionally, different confounders were
adjusted for in each study, and this may have affected the
accuracy of our estimates
in the dose – response meta-
analysis. Eighth, the present results might have been poten-
tially underestimated, as the included studies had adjusted
for variables such as BMI, history of diabetes and hypertension
in the models. Those variables could be in the causal pathway
for the association between SSB intake and the risk of CHD/
stroke. Ninth, although meta-regression was used to explore
the potential sources of heterogeneity for the outcome of
hypertension, none of the known variables was identiﬁed as
a speciﬁc source of heterogeneity. Thus, caution should be
exercised while interpreting pooled estimates showing large
heterogeneity. Tenth,
it is unclear whether the association
that we have found is due to the sugar content of SSB or to
related lifestyle factors associated with the consumption of
SSB, such as other dietary practices, sedentary behaviours
or lack of physical activity. However, the vast majority of
the included studies have controlled for these dietary and
lifestyle factors in the models. Nevertheless, further random-
ised controlled trials are warranted to conﬁrm the observed
association.

In conclusion, a higher consumption of SSB was associated
with a higher risk of hypertension and CHD, but not with the
risk of stroke. Notably, recent evidence suggests that increas-
ing water intake in place of SSB was associated with a lower
risk of weight gain(35) and type 2 diabetes(36). The present
results support recommendations to reduce the consumption
of SSB in order to prevent and control CVD, although further
large prospective studies or randomised controlled trials are
warranted to conﬁrm the observed association.

Original Investigation
Added Sugar Intake and Cardiovascular Diseases Mortality
Among US Adults

Robert Merritt, MA; Frank B. Hu, MD, PhD

IMPORTANCE Epidemiologic studies have suggested that higher intake of added sugar is
associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors. Few prospective studies have
examined the association of added sugar intake with CVD mortality.

OBJECTIVE To examine time trends of added sugar consumption as percentage of daily
calories in the United States and investigate the association of this consumption with CVD
mortality.

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES, 1988-1994 [III], 1999-2004, and 2005-2010 [n = 31 147]) for the time trend
analysis and NHANES III Linked Mortality cohort (1988-2006 [n = 11 733]), a prospective
cohort of a nationally representative sample of US adults for the association study.

MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Cardiovascular disease mortality.

RESULTS Among US adults, the adjusted mean percentage of daily calories from added sugar
increased from 15.7% (95% CI, 15.0%-16.4%) in 1988-1994 to 16.8% (16.0%-17.7%; P = .02) in
1999-2004 and decreased to 14.9% (14.2%-15.5%; P < .001) in 2005-2010. Most adults
consumed 10% or more of calories from added sugar (71.4%) and approximately 10%
consumed 25% or more in 2005-2010. During a median follow-up period of 14.6 years, we
documented 831 CVD deaths during 163 039 person-years. Age-, sex-, and race/ethnicity–
adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) of CVD mortality across quintiles of the percentage of daily
calories consumed from added sugar were 1.00 (reference), 1.09 (95% CI, 1.05-1.13), 1.23
(1.12-1.34), 1.49 (1.24-1.78), and 2.43 (1.63-3.62; P < .001), respectively. After additional
adjustment for sociodemographic, behavioral, and clinical characteristics, HRs were 1.00
(reference), 1.07 (1.02-1.12), 1.18 (1.06-1.31), 1.38 (1.11-1.70), and 2.03 (1.26-3.27; P = .004),
respectively. Adjusted HRs were 1.30 (95% CI, 1.09-1.55) and 2.75 (1.40-5.42; P = .004),
respectively, comparing participants who consumed 10.0% to 24.9% or 25.0% or more
calories from added sugar with those who consumed less than 10.0% of calories from added
sugar. These findings were largely consistent across age group, sex, race/ethnicity (except
among non-Hispanic blacks), educational attainment, physical activity, health eating index,
and body mass index.

CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Most US adults consume more added sugar than is
recommended for a healthy diet. We observed a significant relationship between added
sugar consumption and increased risk for CVD mortality.

Original Investigation Research

C onsumption of added sugar, including all sugars added

inprocessingorpreparingfoods,amongAmericansaged
2 years or older increased from an average of 235 calo-
ries per day in 1977-1978 to 318 calories per day in 1994-1996.
This change was mainly attributed to the increased consump-
tionofsugar-sweetenedbeverages.1Althoughtheabsoluteand
percentage of daily calories derived from added sugars de-
clined between 1999-2000 and 2007-2008, consumption of
added sugars remained high in US diets, especially among
children.2 Recommendations for added sugar consumption
vary substantially. The Institute of Medicine recommends that
added sugar make up less than 25% of total calories,3 whereas
the World Health Organization recommends less than 10%.4
The American Heart Association recommends limiting added
sugars to less than 100 calories daily for women and 150 calo-
ries daily for men.5 The 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans6
recommend limiting total intake of discretionary calories,
which include added sugars and solid fats, to 5% to 15% of daily
caloric intake. Randomized clinical trials and epidemiologic
studies have shown that individuals who consume higher
amounts of added sugar, especially sugar-sweetened bever-
ages, tend to gain more weight7 and have a higher risk of
obesity,2,8-13 type 2 diabetes mellitus,8,14-17 dyslipidemias,18,19
hypertension,20,21 and cardiovascular disease (CVD).14,22 Most
previous studies have focused on sugar-sweetened bever-
ages but not total added sugar, and none of these studies has
used nationally representative samples to examine the rela-
tionship between added sugar intake and CVD mortality.

In the present study, we examined time trends of con-
sumption of added sugar as percentage of total daily calories
using a series of national representative samples. In addition,
we investigated the association of this consumption with CVD
mortality using a prospective cohort of a nationally represen-
tative sample of US adults.

Methods
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES)comprisesaseriesofcross-sectional,stratified,mul-
tistage probability surveys of the civilian, noninstitutional-
ized US population. The NHANES was conducted periodi-
cally before 1994; beginning in 1999, it became a continuous
program, with every 2 years representing 1 cycle. Each survey
participant completed a household interview and underwent
a physical examination at a mobile examination center. De-
tailed descriptions of NHANES methods are published
elsewhere.23,24NHANES III and NHANES 1999-2010 under-
went institutional review board approval and included writ-
ten informed consent.

Thepresentstudycomprised2components:atrendsanaly-
sis of added sugar consumption and an association study of
this consumption with CVD mortality. For the trend analysis,
we used data from NHANES III (1988-1994) and from the con-
tinuous NHANES surveys (1999-2004 and 2005-2010). For
NHANES III, of 16 274 nonpregnant adults aged 20 years or
older, we excluded 588 participants with incomplete data on

first-day 24-hour dietary recall; 1321 who reported a history of
myocardial infarction, stroke, or congestive heart failure; 996
who had diagnosed diabetes mellitus or were taking diabetes
medications; and 452 who had cancer at baseline. We also ex-
cluded 279 participants with a body mass index (BMI) less than
18.5 (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in me-
ters squared) and 905 with missing values on covariates, leav-
ing 11 733 adults for analysis. For NHANES 1999-2004, we
started with 13 422 nonpregnant adults and excluded the fol-
lowing numbers of participants for the same reasons de-
scribed for the 1988-1994 data: 740, 1560, 931, 757, 352, and 296,
respectively, leaving 8786 participants for study. For NHANES
2005-2010, we started with 16 089 nonpregnant adults and ex-
cluded 826, 1733, 1358, 952, 265, and 327 individuals, respec-
tively, leaving a study population of 10 628.

NHANES III Linked Mortality Files (1988-2006)
For the association analysis between the added sugar and the
risk of CVD mortality, we used NHANES III (1988-1994) Linked
Mortality Files (n = 11 733) that were linked through 2006 with
a probabilistic matching algorithm to the National Death In-
dex to determine the mortality status. Follow-up of partici-
pants continued until death attributable to CVD, with censor-
ing at the time of death for those who died from causes other
than CVD. Participants not matched with a death record were
considered to be alive through the entire follow-up period. A
detailed description of this methodology has been published
elsewhere.25,26TheInternationalStatisticalClassificationofDis-
eases, 10th Revision was used to identify participants for whom
CVD(codesI00-I78)waslistedastheunderlyingcauseofdeath.

Estimating Usual Percentage of Calories From Added Sugar
Added sugars include all sugars used in processed or pre-
pared foods, such as sugar-sweetened beverages, grain-
based desserts, fruit drinks, dairy desserts, candy, ready-to-
eat cereals, and yeast breads, but not naturally occurring sugar,
such as in fruits and fruit juices. We used 24-hour dietary re-
call to estimate intake of added sugar. All NHANES partici-
pants who received physical examinations provided a single
24-hour dietary recall through in-person interviews.27 Avail-
ability of second dietary recall varied by time period. In
NHANES III, approximately 8% of the adult participants pro-
vided a second dietary recall; from 1999 to 2002, second re-
calls were not available. In 2003-2004 and 2005-2010, 93% and
88% of participants participated in second dietary surveys
through the telephone interviews 3 to 10 days after mobile ex-
amination center interviews.

Nutrient intake from foods was estimated with the corre-
sponding US Department of Agriculture Food and Nutrient Da-
tabases for Dietary Studies (FNDDSs).28 However, FNDDSs do
not include information on added sugar for many foods. To es-
timate the intake of added sugar, we merged individual food
files from NHANES with the MyPyramid Equivalents Data-
base (MPED).29 The MPED has 2 versions; we merged the
NHANES III and NHANES 1999-2002 individual foods files with
MPED 1.0 and NHANES 2003-2004 and 2005-2010 food files
with MPED 2.0 to calculate intake of added sugars.29,30 Of 5440

Sugar Intake and Cardiovascular Diseases Mortality

in NHANES 2005-2010, 5030 of these foods were available from
MPED 2.0. We matched the remaining 410 foods to the near-
est food codes (most of the matched food codes differed by the
last 2 digits) to estimate added sugar content. For example, the
food code 52302020 (muffin, fruit and/or nut, low fat) was
matched to 52302010 (muffin, fruit and/or nut). A detailed de-
scription of the MPED and estimates of added sugar from foods
are published elsewhere.29

Data from single 24-hour dietary recalls are subject to mea-
surement errors caused by day-to-day variation in intakes,31,32
which tends to attenuate the association.33 To correct for mea-
surement errors, we used a method developed by the Na-
tional Cancer Institute (NCI) that can be used to estimate the
distribution of the usual percentage of calories from added
sugar in the population.34 This method also can be used to ex-
amine the nutrient-disease association corrected for measure-
ment error, also known as the regression calibration.35 The NCI
method requires that at least some respondents have mul-
tiple days of nutrient values to estimate the within- and be-
tween-individual variations.34,36 For the trend analysis, the
models included the following covariates: day of the week
when24-hourrecallwascollected(weekdayvsweekends),age,
sex, and race/ethnicity.36 For the association analysis, we also
included educational attainment, smoking status, alcohol con-
sumption, antihypertensive medication use, physical activ-
ity, family history of CVD, and 1995 Healthy Eating Index (HEI)
scores.36,37

The covariates included race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic
white, non-Hispanic black, Mexican American, or other), edu-
cational attainment (<12, 12, or >12 years of education), smok-
ing status (never, former, or current), alcohol consumption (0,
<3, or ≥3 drinks/wk), physical activity (0, <5, or ≥5 times/wk
of moderate-intensity to vigorous activities), BMI (<25, 25 to
<30, or ≥30), family history of CVD (yes/no), and antihyper-
tensive medication use (yes/no). Systolic blood pressure and
total serum cholesterol (milligrams per deciliter) were in-
cluded as continuous variables. The HEI includes 10 compo-
nents: fruits, vegetables, grains, dairy, meats, fats, saturated
fat, cholesterol, sodium, and dietary variety. The total score
ranges from 0 to 100, with a higher score indicating a healthier
diet.37

Statistical Analysis
We calculated the weighted mean and 95% CI of the usual
percentage of calories from added sugar across categories of
selected covariates for NHANES III (1988-1994), 1999-2004,
and 2005-2010. We also estimated the percentage of the
population who consumed 10% or more4 or 25% or more3 of
calories from added sugar. We conducted the pairwise
2-tailed t tests to identify the difference in means and preva-
lence across surveys.

We used Cox proportional hazards regression to estimate
the hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs for CVD mortality.
Because the observed association between percentage of
calories from added sugar and CVD mortality appeared to be
nonlinear (P < .05 for linearity), we used the Box-Cox trans-
formation, with λ = 2.5 when estimating the usual percent-
age of calories from added sugar using the NCI method.35 To

present the results, we calculated the 10th, 30th, 50th, 70th,
and90thpercentiles’distributionoftheestimatedaddedsugar
intake as the middle value of each quintile. We estimated the
adjusted HRs by comparing the middle values of each quin-
tile (Q) with the lowest quintile as reference (Q5, Q4, Q3, and
Q2vsQ1).35,38Toexaminetheassociationbetweenaddedsugar
intake and CVD mortality by different cut points, ie, less than
10% by the World Health Organization (in line with the Ameri-
can Heart Association’s recommendation)4,5 and less than 25%
by the Institute of Medicine,3 we estimated the adjusted HRs
by comparing participants who consumed 25% or more, more
than 10%, and less than 25% of their calories from added sugar
with those who consumed less than 10% of their calories from
added sugar. We estimated age-, sex-, and race/ethnicity–
adjusted HRs as well as the multivariable-adjusted HRs in-
cluding age, sex, race/ethnicity, educational attainment, smok-
ing status, alcohol consumption, antihypertensive medication
use, physical activity level, family history of CVD, HEI score,
BMI, systolic blood pressure, total serum cholesterol, and total
calories. We also determined the results of stratified analysis
by age group (<60 years vs ≥60 years), sex, race/ethnicity, edu-
cational attainment (<12 vs ≥12 years), physical activity (≥5
times/wk of moderate-intensity vs vigorous activities vs oth-
ers), HEI score (top 50% [score ≥63.5] vs other), and BMI (nor-
mal vs overweight/obese). We calculated the covariates-
adjusted number needed to harm associated with each quintile
of added sugar intake at 15-years of follow-up (15 years repre-
sents the median follow-up),39 and the 95% CI of the number
needed to harm was based on 2.5th and 97.5th percentile val-
ues of 500 rescaled bootstrap weights.40,41

The proportional hazards assumption of the Cox models
was evaluated with Schoenfeld residuals, which revealed no
significant departures from proportionality in hazards over
time. We tested for interactions of the usual percentage of calo-
ries from added sugar with covariates by including the inter-
action terms in the Cox models based on Satterthwaite-
adjusted F tests.42,43

We conducted several sensitivity analyses (Supplement
[eAppendix and eTables 1-7]). All analyses were conducted
with SAS, version 9.3 (SAS Institute, Inc) or SUDAAN, version
11, to take into account the complex sampling design.43 All
tests were 2-sided, and P < .05 was considered statistically
significant.

Results
Of participants included in the study from the NHANES III
(1988-1994) (n = 11 733), NHANES 1999-2004 (n = 8786), and
NHANES 2005-2010 (n = 10 628), the proportion of non-
Hispanic whites decreased from 76.3% in 1988-1994 to 69.6%
in 2005-2010 (P = .004) and the Mexican American propor-
tion increased from 5.1% to 9.0% in 2005-2010 (P < .001). The
mean percentage of calories from added sugar increased from
15.7% (95% CI, 15.0%-16.4%) in 1988-1994 to 16.8% (16.0%-
17.7%; P < .02) in 1999-2004 and decreased to 14.9% (14.2%-
15.5%; P < .001) in 2005-2010 (Table 1). Most adults con-
sumed 10% or more of calories from added sugar (71.4%), and

from 265 (95% CI, 166-715) to 22 (13-66) (Table 2).

The observed association between usual percentage of
calories from added sugar and increased risk of CVD mortal-
ity was largely consistent across age group, sex, race/
ethnicity (except among non-Hispanic blacks), educational
attainment, physical activity level, HEI score, and BMI
(Figure 2 and Supplement [eTable 1 and eFigure]). However,
we observed a marginally significant interaction between
percentage of calories from added sugar and race/ethnicity
(P = .09), and the pattern of this association was observed in
other groups but not among non-Hispanic blacks (Supple-
ment [eTable 1]). Compared with the participants who con-
sumed less than 10% of calories from added sugar (same as
in Q1), those who consumed above the thresholds of 10% or
25% of calories from added sugar were younger; more likely

to be non-Hispanic black; less likely to be currently smoking;
had lower levels of physical activity, total serum cholesterol,
systolic blood pressure, HEI, American Heart Association
healthy diet score,44 and antihypertensive medication use;
and had higher intake of sugar-sweetened beverages and
prevalence of family history of CVD (Supplement [eTable 2]).
Participants who consumed added sugar exceeding the rec-
ommendations, especially 25% or more of calories from
added sugar, had a higher percentage of calories from the
sugar/sweets/beverage group and a lower percentage of calo-
ries from all other food groups except milk products (Supple-
ment [eTable 2]).

As expected, the association using only a single-day 24-
hour recall was attenuated but remained significant (Supple-
ment [eTable 3]). In the analysis including all NHANES III par-
ticipants with nonmissing covariates (n = 14 338), the
association was moderately attenuated (Supplement [eTable
4]). In the fully adjusted model, the HR for total mortality was
1.28 (95% CI, 0.94-1.75) in the highest quintile (Supplement
[eTable 5]). Detailed analysis between added sugar intake and
each component of the HEI suggested that added sugar in-

Sugar Intake and Cardiovascular Diseases Mortality

Discussion

Our results suggest that the usual percentage of calories from
added sugar among US adults increased from the late 1980s
to1999-2004anddecreasedduring2005-2010.Mostadultscon-
sumed more than 10% of their total calories from added sugar,
and approximately 10% of adults consumed 25% or more of
calories from added sugar in 2005-2010. Compared with those
who consumed approximately 8.0% of calories from added
sugar, participants who consumed approximately 17% to 21%
(Q4) of calories from added sugar had a 38% higher risk of CVD
mortality.Thisrelativeriskwasmorethandoubleforthosewho
consumed21%ormore(highestquintile)ofcaloriesfromadded
sugar.

Major sources of added sugar in American adults’ diet
included sugar-sweetened beverages (37.1%), grain-based
desserts (13.7%), fruit drinks (8.9%), dairy desserts (6.1%),
and candy (5.8%).45 One 360-mL can of regular soda con-
tains about 35 g of sugar (140 calories) or 7% of total calories
(based on 2000 kcal/d). There is no universally accepted
guideline for added sugar consumption. The Institute of
Medicine recommended no more than 25% calories from
added sugar based on the NHANES III study of increased
consumption of added sugar and reduced intake of macro-
nutrients, especially at the level of more than 25%.3 How-
ever, this recommendation did not consider health effects.
The World Health Organization recommended less than 10%
of calories from added sugar based on its assessment of
higher consumption and adverse health outcomes.4 With
the evidence of higher added sugar consumption and
adverse health outcomes accumulating, the American Heart
Association recommended that total calories from added
sugar should be less than 100 calories/d for most women and
less than 150 calories/d for most men.5 Our analysis suggests
that participants who consumed greater than or equal to
10% but less than 25% of calories from added sugar, the level
below the Institute of Medicine recommendation and above
the World Health Organization/American Heart Association
recommendation, had a 30% higher risk of CVD mortality;
for those who consumed 25% or more of calories from added
sugar, the relative risk was nearly tripled (fully adjusted
HR, 2.75).

In our analysis, regular consumption of sugar-sweetened
beverages (≥7 servings/wk) was associated with increased risk
of CVD mortality. Several observational studies22,46 have sug-
gested that higher intake of sugar-sweetened beverages is sig-
nificantly associated with increased incidence of CVD, inde-
pendent of other risk factors. In the present study, the positive
association between added sugar intake and CVD mortality re-
mainedsignificantafteradjustingfortheconventionalCVDrisk
factors,suchasbloodpressureandtotalserumcholesterol.The
association might be mediated through additional biological
pathways, although a single measure of these risk factors may
not have captured the mediational effects. In addition, the ob-
served association was consistent across age group, sex, race/
ethnicity (except among non-Hispanic blacks), educational at-
tainment, physical activity levels, HEI score, and BMI.

Epidemiologic studies5,47 have suggested that higher con-
sumption of added sugar is associated with increased con-
sumption of total calories and unhealthy dietary patterns,
which in turn might increase the risk of unhealthy outcomes,
such as weight gain, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and CVD. Thus,
added sugar intake may be a marker for unhealthy dietary pat-
terns. However, when we adjusted for overall diet quality as
reflected by HEI and its individual components, the results did
not change appreciably, suggesting that the association be-
tween added sugar intake and CVD mortality was not ex-
plained by overall diet quality.

The biological mechanisms underlying the association be-
tween added sugar intake and CVD risk are not completely un-
derstood. Emerging evidence supports the hypothesis that ex-
cessiveintakeofaddedsugarmightplayarolethroughmultiple
pathways.14 Animal studies48 have suggested that high in-
take of refined sugars, independent of weight gain, was asso-
ciated with the development of hypertension. A recent obser-
vational study20 suggested that excessive consumption of
sugar-sweetened beverages and sugar was independently as-
sociated with increased blood pressure. Excessive intake of
sugar was also associated with increased de novo lipogenesis
in the liver, hepatic triglyceride synthesis, and increased tri-
glyceride levels, a known risk factor for CVD.5,49 In one study,18
regular intake of added sugar was significantly associated with
increased triglyceride levels and low-density lipoprotein cho-
lesterol levels and decreased high-density lipoprotein choles-
terol levels. Another proposed pathway of the relationship be-
tween excessive sugar intake and increased CVD risk is its
association with inflammation markers, which are key fac-
torsinthepathogenesisofCVD.14,50,51Severalrecentstudies52,53
have indicated an association between higher consumption of
sugar-sweetened beverages and inflammatory markers. In ad-
dition, a recent study12 suggested a significant interaction be-
tween genetic factors and sugar-sweetened beverage con-
sumption in relation to BMI, in which higher consumption was
associated with increased genetic effects of obesity. Another
study54suggestedthatcarryingageneticvariantinthePNPLA3
gene might be susceptible to increased hepatic fat, which is as-
sociated with increased risk for CVD, when dietary sugar in-
take was high among Hispanic children. Further studies are
needed to examine potential interactions between genetic sus-
ceptibility and added sugar intake in relation to CVD risk.

Our study has several strengths. First, the availability of
data on added sugar intake from a series of nationally repre-
sentative samples of US adults allowed us to examine trends
of consumption. Second, we used a validated method to esti-
mate the usual percentage of calories from added sugar. The
use of the NCI method to estimate usual nutrient intake pro-
vided a more powerful way to assess nutrient-disease asso-
ciations compared with the use of a single 24-hour dietary
recall.34-36,38 Finally, our study adjusted for a wide range of po-
tential confounding variables.

There are also several limitations to our study. First, in
NHANES III (1988-1994), approximately 8% (n = 962) of the
participants provided a second-day 24-hour dietary recall.
However, these data were adequate to provide a robust esti-
mate of usual intake of added sugar.31,34 For later NHANES

years, more than 88% of the participants provided a second
24-hour recall. When we pooled 1999-2002 data (which had
single 24-hour dietary recalls) with 2003-2004 data to esti-
mate usual intake, our results were consistent when restrict-
ing analysis to NHANES 2003-2004 data (results not shown).
Second, for the association analysis, added sugar intake was
assessed at baseline and not updated during the follow-up
period. The baseline exposure might not capture changes in
intake over time. Third, although we adjusted for a compre-
hensive set of covariates in our multivariable models, the
associations reported in our study may partially result from
other unobserved confounding variables, from residual con-
founding, or by other dietary variables.55 However, use of
the HEI provided a comprehensive assessment of overall
dietary pattern and should have significantly reduced the
confounding effect of other dietary variables. Further
adjusting the sodium intake did not alter the results. Fourth,
the observed association between added sugar and CVD
mortality was significant in other groups but not among
non-Hispanic blacks, perhaps because of a limited number

of events in subgroups. Another possible explanation is that
non-Hispanic blacks may be less susceptible to the metabolic
effects of sugars, although this hypothesis needs to be fur-
ther tested.12,54,56 Finally, although observational studies are
important in improving our understanding of nutrient-
disease relationships, they should not be directly interpreted
as evidence of causal relationships without considering
other lines of evidence.57

Conclusions
OurfindingsindicatethatmostUSadultsconsumemoreadded
sugar than is recommended for a healthy diet. A higher per-
centage of calories from added sugar is associated with sig-
nificantly increased risk of CVD mortality. In addition, regu-
lar consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages is associated
with elevated CVD mortality. Our results support current rec-
ommendations to limit the intake of calories from added sug-
ars in US diets.

Abstract

Background—Considerable controversy exists regarding the association between coffee
consumption and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. A meta-analysis was performed to assess the
dose-response relationship of long-term coffee consumption with CVD risk.
Methods and Results—Pubmed and EMBASE were searched for prospective cohort studies of
the relationship between coffee consumption and CVD risk, which included coronary heart
disease, stroke, heart failure, and CVD mortality. Thirty-six studies were included with 1,279,804
participants and 36,352 CVD cases. A non-linear relationship of coffee consumption with CVD
risk was identified (P for heterogeneity = 0.09, P for trend < 0.001, P for non-linearity < 0.001).
Compared with the lowest category of coffee consumption (median: 0 cups/d), the relative risk of
CVD was 0.95 (95% CI, 0.87 to 1.03) for the highest (median: 5 cups/d) category, 0.85 (0.80 to
0.90) for the second highest (median: 3.5 cups/d), and 0.89 (0.84 to 0.94) for the third highest
category (median: 1.5 cups/d). Looking at separate outcomes, coffee consumption was non-
linearly associated with both CHD (P for heterogeneity = 0.001, P for trend < 0.001, P for non-
linearity < 0.001) and stroke risks (P for heterogeneity = 0.07, P for trend < 0.001, P for non-
linearity< 0.001) (P for trend differences > 0.05).
Conclusions—A non-linear association between coffee consumption with CVD risk was
observed in this meta-analysis. Moderate coffee consumption was inversely significantly
associated with CVD risk, with the lowest CVD risk at 3 to 5 cups/d, and heavy coffee
consumption was not associated with elevated CVD risk.

Methods

Coffee is one of the most widely consumed beverages around the world; thus, investigating
whether or not coffee consumption is associated with chronic disease risk has important
public health implications. The relationship between coffee consumption and risk of
coronary heart disease was first studied in the 1960s, given that the prevalence of coffee
drinking and CHD were both high in western countries.1 Short-term metabolic studies found
that caffeine ingestion acutely induces cardiac arrhythmias, and increases plasma renin
activity, catecholamine concentrations, and blood pressure.2, 3 In the 1980s, cross-sectional
studies found a positive association between coffee consumption and serum total cholesterol
concentrations, which might be related to the coffee brewing method (i.e. boiled or
unfiltered coffee).4 A later randomized trial showed that boiled coffee consumption
increased the serum cholesterol.5 From the 1980s to the 2000s, many case-control studies,
which are prone to recall and selection bias, showed a positive association between coffee
consumption and CHD risk.6–8 In contrast, meta-analyses of prospective cohort studies
tended to find no association, although results varied substantially across studies.9, 10

Since 2000, the association between coffee consumption and other cardiovascular disease
(CVD) outcomes such as stroke, heart failure, and total CVD mortality has also been more
frequently studied.11–13 Meta-analyses have been published to summarize the association
between coffee and risk of CHD,14 stroke,15 and heart failure.16 These meta-analyses did
not support an association between coffee consumption and a higher CVD risk, but the
shape of the association remains uncertain. Moreover, a number of additional studies have
been published since the publication of these meta-analyses,11, 13, 17–19 and one recent meta-
analysis paper showed that heavy coffee consumption was not associated with risk of CVD
mortality.20 To examine the dose response association of coffee consumption with
cardiovascular disease risk, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of coffee
consumption and incidence of total CVD outcomes, including incidence of CHD, stroke, and
heart failure, and CVD mortality.

We followed the Meta-Analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology21 protocol
throughout the design, implementation, analysis, and reporting of our meta-analysis.

Search strategy and selection criteria

We searched the PubMed and EMBASE databases for prospective studies that had evaluated
the association between coffee consumption and risk of CVD between January 1966 and
March 2013. The computer-based searches included the key words “coffee”, “cardiovascular
disease”, “coronary heart disease”, “stroke”, “mortality”, “heart failure”, “myocardial
infarction”, “ischemic heart disease”, “sudden cardiac arrest”, and “acute coronary
syndrome”. Reference lists of retrieved articles were manually scanned for all relevant
additional studies and review articles. We restricted the search to studies on humans that
were written in English.

Study Selection

Studies were included in this meta-analysis if they met the following criteria: 1) prospective
cohort studies, including case-cohort studies and nested case-control studies with a
prospective design; 2) the exposure was coffee consumption, including total coffee,
caffeinated coffee, or decaffeinated coffee; 3) the outcome was risk of CVD, including
incidence of CHD, stroke, and heart failure, and CVD mortality. Studies were excluded if 1)
the study had a retrospective design; 2) the estimates were presented without standard errors
or other information that allowed calculation of standard errors; 3) the outcome was atrial

confounders were adjusted for.

Data extraction and quality assessment

One author (M. D.) assessed study eligibility and extracted the data, the other author (A. S.)
independently double-checked the available data. The following data were extracted from
each study: first author's name, year of publication, geographical location, follow-up time,
sex, age, number of CVD events, number of participants/person-years of follow up,
categories of coffee consumption, mean/median coffee consumption in each category, CVD
assessment method, covariates adjusted for in the multivariable analysis, and relative risks
and the associated measure of variance for all categories of coffee consumption. For cohorts
with published data on several CVD outcomes, we chose incidence instead of mortality or
heart failure results. For studies with data on both CHD and stroke as the outcome, we
included both in the meta-analysis. The correlation of CHD and stroke was accounted for in
the main analysis (see below). In a sensitivity analysis, we analyzed one of the two
outcomes. The Newcastle-Ottawa quality assessment scale (NOS) 22was used to evaluate the
quality of the included studies. M. D. and S. B. developed the evaluation criteria
(supplemental table 1). The score ranges from 0 to 9 points with a higher score indicating
higher study quality.

To perform a dose-response meta-analysis, we assigned the median coffee consumption in
each category of consumption to the corresponding relative risk for each study. We used
means for this purpose if medians were not reported. If neither the mean nor the median
consumption per category was reported, the midpoint of the upper and lower boundaries in
each category was used to estimate median consumption. If the upper boundary for the
highest category was not provided, the assigned median value was 25% higher than the
lower boundary of that category. If the lower boundary for the lowest category was not
provided, the assigned median value was half of the upper boundary of that category.

Data Synthesis and Analysis

To analyze the trend of coffee consumption and risk of CVD, we used both semi-parametric
and parametric methods. For the semi-parametric method, four coffee consumption groups
were generated, namely lowest, third highest, second highest, and highest. For each study
that was included, the lowest and the highest coffee consumption categories corresponded to
the lowest and highest groups, respectively. For studies with four exposure categories, the
second and third categories corresponded to the second and third highest groups,
respectively. For studies with three exposure categories, the middle category corresponded
to either the second or the third highest group in the meta-analysis, depending on the
similarity of the median coffee consumption to either the second or the third highest group
of the meta-analysis. If the study had more than four exposure categories, two consumption
groups, other than the lowest and highest, were chosen based on their similarity of the
amount of coffee consumption in that category to the second and third highest groups of the
meta-analysis. For each group, we computed correlation coefficients (ρ) between CHD and
stroke outcomes in the same cohort. We imputed ρ =1 initially to obtain the most
conservative effect estimates. A random-effects model was used first and was changed to a
fixed-effects model if no between study heterogeneity was found for the random-effects
model (tau-squared < 1). 23 Sensitivity analysis was conducted by imputing different ρ (0 <
ρ ≤ 1) to evaluate the robustness of the effect estimates. We used the STATA command
ROBUMETA to obtain the effect estimates.

For the parametric method, a dose-response meta-analysis was performed.24 The number of
cases and participants in each coffee consumption category was extracted to estimate the

covariance of the relative risk in each study. Together with the observed adjusted variance of
the relative risk, we estimated the variance/covariance matrix of the data. The weight of
each study was calculated as the inverse of the variance/covariance matrix. We used
generalized least squares models (GLST) with the maximum likelihood method to estimate
the coefficients for each study. We fit a fixed-effects generalized linear model first, and
changed to a random-effects generalized linear model if the p value for the goodness of fit/
heterogeneity of the previous model was < 0.05. Additionally, we tested for potential non-
linearity in the association between coffee consumption and CVD risk using a fixed/random-
effects restricted cubic spline model with 3 knots. In sensitivity analysis, we used two-stage
fixed/random-effects dose response models to combine studies that reported results for
categorized coffee consumption and studies with reported results for continuous coffee
consumption. Specifically, the RR of CVD per unit increase of coffee consumption for each
study was first estimated separately by GLST, and then the RRs from all of the studies were
pooled together by a fixed/random-effects model. We used the STATA command GLST for
model fitting, and the command LINCOME to obtain effect estimates for the fitted model.

We performed stratified analyses by baseline hypertension or MI of the study population,
smoking status, publication year, NOS study quality score, dietary assessment method,
evaluation of stroke or CHD as the outcome, country, sex, and type of coffee (caffeinated
coffee or decaffeinated coffee). The interaction between categorized coffee consumption and
the stratifying variable with the risk of CVD was tested by a likelihood ratio test comparing
the models derived using GLST method with and without the interaction terms. We assessed
the potential for publication bias using Egger's regression symmetry test.25 All analyses
were conducted using STATA Version 11.2 (STATA Corp, College Station, Texas).

Results
Characteristics of studies

Our initial search identified 2587 potentially relevant citations. After screening titles and
abstracts, we identified 53 studies for further evaluation. Of the 53 initially included studies,
we excluded 14 studies due to duplicate publication, one study with point estimate without
standard error, and one nested case control study with a retrospective design. Thirty-six
studies remained in the meta-analysis (Figure 1). The included studies comprised
approximately 1,283,685 study participants and 47,779 CVD cases, including 28,347 CHD
cases, 12,030 stroke cases and 7,402 other CVD cases. Characteristics of these 36 studies
are shown in Table 1. One study had a nested case-control study design, one had a case-
cohort study design, and the rest of the studies were cohort studies. Duration of follow-up
for incident CVD ranged from 6 to 44 years, with a median follow-up of 10 years. Twenty-
one studies were conducted in Europe, 12 in the US, and 3 in Japan. Three studies assessed
coffee consumption repeatedly during the course of the follow-up, and the rest of the studies
assessed coffee consumption at baseline. Thirteen studies assessed coffee consumption
without using a specific dietary assessment method, and the rest of the studies assessed
coffee consumption by diet recalls, diet records or food frequency questionnaires (FFQ).
One study modeled coffee consumption as a continuous variable, and the remaining studies
modeled coffee consumption categorically. Nine studies assessed the association of
caffeinated coffee consumption with CVD risk, and four studies assessed the association of
decaffeinated coffee consumption with CVD risk. The outcome in 17 studies was risk of
stroke, while the outcome in 22 studies was risk of CHD. The scores of the NOS quality
assessment ranged from 3 to 8, and 31 studies had scores of 5 or higher. The corresponding
results of each criteria of the NOS quality assessment for our meta-analysis are shown in
Supplemental Table 1. The study modeling coffee as a continuous exposure was excluded in
the following analysis due to the difficulty of combining the risk estimate with those of other
studies and was only included in the sensitivity analysis.26 All of the remaining 35 studies

were included in the main analysis, and 29 studies were included in the dose-response
analysis between coffee consumption and risk of CVD.

Coffee consumption and risk of CVD

The relative risks for CVD with different coffee consumption categories relative to the
lowest category are shown in Figure 2. Of the 35 studies, 6 cohorts presented the outcome of
stroke and CHD simultaneously. Compared with the lowest category of coffee consumption
(median and mean: 0 cups/d), the pooled RR for incident CVD was 0.89 (95% CI, 0.84 to
0.94) for the third highest (median: 1.5 cups/d; mean: 1.48 cups/d), 0.85 (95% CI, 0.80 to
0.90) for the second highest (median: 3.5 cups/d; mean: 3 cups/d) and 0.95 (95% CI, 0.87 to
1.03) for the highest (median: 5 cups/d; mean: 5.5 cups/d) category of coffee consumption
(Figure 2). Low between-study variances of CVD risk were found for each category of
coffee consumption (tau-squared = 0.00 for the random-effects models), and the imputed
correlation coefficient between the risks of stroke and CHD within the same cohort (0 < ρ ≤
1) did not have an effect on the relative risk of CVD for each category of coffee
consumption.

Stratified analyses

Stratified analyses were conducted according to baseline hypertension or MI of the study
population, smoking status, publication year, NOS study quality score, dietary assessment
method (24-h diet recall/diet record/FFQ versus other methods), stroke versus CHD as the
outcome, country, sex, and type of coffee (caffeinated coffee or decaffeinated coffee). No
interactions between categorized coffee consumption and stratification variables in relation
to CVD risk were observed (all P for interactions >0.05) (Figure 3). Only 4 studies provided
the stratified results by age.27–30 The summarized results showed that, comparing the
highest with the lowest intakes, the RR of CVD was 0.96 (95% CI, 0.65 to 1.42) for age <
65 years, and the RR was 0.91 (95% CI, 0.59 to 1.40) for age ≥ 65 years.

For the risk of CHD, compared with the lowest category of coffee consumption, the RRs of
CHD were 0.89 (95% CI, 0.85 to 0.94; P for heterogeneity = 0.83; I2 = 0.0%) for the third
highest category, 0.90 (95% CI, 0.84 to 0.97; P for heterogeneity = 0.02; I2 = 40.3%) for the
second highest category, and 0.93 (95% CI, 0.84 to 1.02; P for heterogeneity < 0.001; I2 =
52.8%) for the highest category of coffee consumption. The corresponding RRs of stroke
were 0.89 (95% CI, 0.84 to 0.94; P for heterogeneity = 0.58; I2 = 0.0%) for the third
category, 0.80 (95% CI, 0.75 to 0.86; P for heterogeneity = 0.37; I2 = 6.5%) for the second
category, and 0.95 (95% CI, 0.84 to 1.07; P for heterogeneity = 0.001; I2 = 54.5%) for the
highest category.

Dose-response analysis of coffee consumption with risk of CVD

In our dose-response analysis, we observed a non-linear association between coffee
consumption and risk of CVD (P for non-linearity < 0.001) with a significant trend (P for
trend <0.001) and limited heterogeneity in study results (P for heterogeneity = 0.09) (Figure
4a). Compared to those with no coffee consumption, the RR estimated directly from the
cubic spline model was 0.95 (95% CI, 0.93 to 0.97) for 1 cup/d, 0.92 (95% CI, 0.88 to 0.95)
for 2 cups/d, 0.89 (95% CI, 0.85 to 0.93) for 3 cups/d, 0.88 (95% CI, 0.83 to 0.93) for 4
cups/d, 0.89 (95% CI, 0.83 to 0.95) for 5 cups/d, 0.91 (95% CI, 0.84 to 0.99) for 6 cups/d,
and 0.93 (95% CI, 0.85 to 1.03) for 7 cups/d.

Non-linear (p values for non-linearity <0.001) associations between coffee consumption and
disease risk with significant trends (p values for trend <0.001) were found for both CHD and
stroke (Figures 4b and 4c). There was stronger evidence for heterogeneity in study results

for the association of coffee consumption with CHD risk (P heterogeneity=0.001) than for
the association with stroke risk (P heterogeneity=0.07).

We further explored the reason for the heterogeneity between coffee consumption and CHD
risk by stratifying the studies by publication year (≤ 2000 or > 2000). We found that in
studies published in year 2000 or earlier, coffee consumption was not significantly
associated with CHD risk (n=13, P for heterogeneity = 0.20), whereas in later studies, coffee
consumption was nonlinearly associated with CHD risk (n= 18, P for heterogeneity = 0.08).
We didn't perform a similar analysis for stroke because very few studies on stroke were
published prior to 2000.

Sensitivity analysis

We tested the robustness of our results in sensitivity analyses. Because the RRs of stroke
and CHD from the same cohort were correlated and a total of 6 studies included both CHD
and stroke results, we conducted a sensitivity analysis by including only one outcome at a
time. Our results remained largely unchanged and non-linear curves were found with
including either CHD or stroke as the outcome (Supplemental Figure 1a and 1b).

One study with coffee consumption modeled as a continuous variable was excluded from the
main analysis;26 we added the RR from this study to the dose-response analysis by a two
stage method and the results did not substantially change.

To test whether the association between coffee consumption and risk of CVD was different
for unadjusted and multivariable adjusted models, we performed a dose-response meta-
analysis of the only age-adjusted data including 34 comparisons (Supplemental Figure 2).
Multivariate adjustment strengthened the inverse association between moderate
consumption and CVD risk, most likely due to adjustment for smoking.

Publication bias

The Egger test did not suggest publication bias for associations for any category of coffee
consumption and risk of CVD (Supplemental Figure 3 and Table 2).

DISCUSSION

The findings from this systematic review and meta-analysis, based on approximately
1,283,685 study participants and 47,779 CVD cases, including about 28,347 CHD cases,
12,030 stroke cases and 7,402 other CVD cases, demonstrate a non-linear association
between coffee consumption and risk of CVD. Moderate coffee consumption (3–5 cups/day)
was associated with lower CVD risk, and heavy coffee consumption (≥6 cups/day) was
neither associated with a higher nor a lower risk of CVD.

In contrast to our results, a previous meta-analysis summarizing 21 prospective cohort
studies31 found no association between moderate coffee consumption and CHD risk in the
overall population. One possible reason is that the previous meta-analysis included 7 studies
without adjustment for confounders, which might have biased the relative risks upwards
because of confounding by factors such as smoking.

A recent cohort study by Liu et al32 found that 4 cups per day of coffee consumption was
associated with increased mortality, but the association was only significant for participants
under 55 years old. The results from this study contradict those from this meta-analysis and
the majority of studies in the literature. Possible reasons for this discrepancy include a
relatively small size, lack of updated dietary assessment, and subgroup analysis. In our

meta-analysis, stratified analysis by age revealed no significant differences in the association
across age groups.

The debate about the relation between coffee consumption and CVD risk mainly stemmed
from inconsistent results according to different study designs. Case-control studies, which
are prone to recall bias and selection bias, tended to show a positive association, whereas
cohort studies generally showed a null association.10 Still, findings from prospective cohort
studies on coffee consumption and CVD risk have remained inconsistent. Differences
among studies in sample sizes, the characteristics of the study populations, the assessment
methods for coffee consumption, and statistical adjustments may have contributed to
divergent results. Since the true association between coffee consumption and CVD risk is
likely to be modest and nonlinear, the differences in coffee assessments and covariate
adjustments may result in changes the magnitude and even the direction of the associations
and thus lead to different conclusions.

The U-shaped association between coffee consumption and CVD risk observed in this meta-
analysis need to be considered from both methodological and biological points of view.
First, individuals with hypertension or other conditions related to CVD risk might have
changed their coffee consumption before baseline. Thus, baseline disease, especially
hypertension, as a confounder could result in reverse causation. However, we observed no
significant difference in the association between coffee consumption and CVD risk between
cohorts with hypertensive and MI patients and the general population cohorts. Second,
smoking is likely to be an important confounder for the association between coffee
consumption and CVD risk, and could bias the relative risks upwards. Heavy coffee
consumption was associated with higher risk of CVD in age-adjusted analyses, but this is
likely due to confounding by smoking. After adjustment for smoking and other covariates,
heavy coffee was consumption was not significantly associated with CVD and the inverse
association between moderate consumption and CVD became stronger.

The non-linear U-shaped between coffee consumption and CVD risk might also be true
based on plausible biological mechanisms. Coffee is a complex chemical mixture with
hundreds of compounds including the phenolic compound chlorogenic acid, caffeine,
minerals such as potassium and magnesium, niacin and its precursor trigonelline, and
lignans. Coffee consumption has been associated with higher insulin sensitivity, a lower risk
of type 2 diabetes, and lower concentrations of inflammatory markers such as C-reactive
protein and E-selectin.33, 34 However, short-term metabolic studies have shown that caffeine
can acutely increase blood pressure by antagonizing the adenosine A1 and A2A
receptor,35–37 and could also acutely adversely affect arterial stiffness and endothelium
dependent vasodilation.38, 39 Long-term heavy coffee consumption has been associated with
a slightly elevated risk of hypertension,40 and a higher level of plasma homocysteine.41, 42
In addition, cafestol in unfiltered coffee increases serum total cholesterol concentrations.43
The non-linear U-shaped between coffee consumption and risk of CVD might be due to a
combination of beneficial and detrimental effects: for moderate coffee consumption,
beneficial effects may be greater than adverse effects; whereas for heavy consumption,
detrimental effect may counterbalance beneficial effects. Results from case crossover studies
suggest that coffee consumption transiently increases risk of nonfatal myocardial infarction,
ischemic stroke onset, and sudden cardiac death.44–46 However, we could not differentiate
acute effects from long-term effects of habitual coffee consumption in this study.

No significant association between decaffeinated coffee consumption with CVD risk was
observed in this meta-analysis. There were several potential explanations. First, the
consumption of decaffeinated coffee was much lower than caffeinated coffee, diminishing
the power to detect any association. Second, the null association might be due to a reverse

causation problem in that individuals with hypertension or other CVD-related conditions
might switch from regular coffee to decaffeinated coffee. This reverse causation may
mitigate an inverse association between decaffeinated coffee consumption and CVD risk.

We did not observe a significant association between coffee consumption and CHD risk for
earlier publications (2000 or earlier). There are two potential reasons for this finding. First,
coffee brewing methods have changed over time and nowadays the filter method has
become more popular, effectively replacing unfiltered forms of coffee such as boiled coffee
that was more widely consumed by participants in earlier studies. It has been shown that
drinking boiled coffee increases serum cholesterol, an important risk factor for CVD5.
Second, in earlier studies, the sample size was typically small; the measurement of baseline
characteristics was typically crude; statistical control of confounders such as diet was
inadequate; and the average NOS study quality score was lower. Our stratified analysis
showed that coffee consumption was not associated with CVD risk in subgroups with a
lower NOS score.

A study by Cornelis MC et al.47 showed that CYP1A2 genotype was an effect modifier
between coffee consumption and risk of myocardial infarction: coffee consumption was
related to higher risk of myocardial infarction for the slow caffeine metabolizer, and was not
related to myocardial infarction for the fast caffeine metabolizer. However, this analysis was
based on a case-control study conducted in Costa Rico and the results have not been
replicated in prospective cohort studies yet.

Recently, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) found a highly significant association
between a variant on CYP1A2 and coffee intake48. However, this variant explains only a
very small population variance. Since the vast majority of our participants were Caucasians,
the allele frequency was expected to be consistent across various cohorts. Ideally, the meta-
analyses should be done according to different genotypes of CYP1A2. However, none of the
included cohorts assessed the genotypes and thus we were unable to conduct such a
stratified analysis.

Our meta-analysis has several strengthens. First, our meta-analysis included 35 cohort
studies and 1,283,685 participants, which provided sufficient power to detect modest
associations. Second, because of the prospective design of all included studies, differential
misclassification of coffee consumption due to recall bias was minimized and the likelihood
of selection bias is reduced. Third, we used both semi-parametric and parametric methods,
and both analyses indicated a U-shaped relationship between coffee consumption and CVD
risk. Finally, we conducted stratified analyses according to disease endpoints, geographic
locations of the studies, type of coffee, and baseline characteristics of the study populations.
The subgroup results are highly consistent and robust.

Our study also has several limitations. Given the observational nature of the studies, the
possibility of residual confounding cannot be excluded. However, since higher coffee
consumption was generally associated with a less healthy lifestyle such as a higher
prevalence of cigarette smoking, less physical activity, and a less healthy diet, the observed
association between moderate coffee consumption and a lower CVD risk is unlikely to be
explained by these confounders. In addition, residual confounding by smoking may have
biased the association for heavy coffee consumption upward, which may explain our finding
that adjustment for smoking and other covariates actually strengthened the inverse
association. Nonetheless, because of the observational nature of the included studies, a
causal relationship cannot be established with these data alone. In addition, coffee brewing
methods were not assessed in the included studies. However, given coffee consumption
habits in the studied populations most consumed coffee is likely to have been filtered coffee.

As a result, our results may not apply to unfiltered coffee (e.g. French press, Scandinavian
boiled, or Turkish/Greek coffee).

In conclusion, our meta-analysis suggests a non-linear relationship between coffee
consumption and CVD risk. Moderate coffee consumption was associated with lower CVD
risk, with the lowest CVD risk at 3 to 5 cups/d of coffee consumption, and heavy coffee
consumption was not associated with CVD risk. This non-linear association with coffee
consumption was observed for both the risk of CHD and stroke.

Clinical perspective

Coffee is one of the most widely consumed beverages around the world, and its
association with cardiovascular disease has been investigated in numerous epidemiologic
studies. However, a key issue that remains to be resolved is the dose response
relationship of long-term coffee consumption with cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk,
including incidence of CHD, stroke, and heart failure, and CVD mortality. In the current
meta-analysis, we summarized results from 36 prospective cohort studies on coffee
consumption and CVD risk with 1,279,804 study participants and 36,352 CVD cases. We
found a non-linear relationship of coffee consumption with CVD risk: moderate coffee
consumption was associated with lower risk of CVD, with the lowest CVD risk at 3 to 5
cups/d, and heavy coffee consumption was not associated with risk of CVD. Looking at
separately, we also found non-linear relationships of coffee consumption with CHD and
stroke risks. The present study provides strong evidence that long-term heavy
consumption of coffee is not associated with CVD risk, and also provides insight into the
potential mechanism of the non-linear relationship between coffee consumption and
CVD risk. We believe that this report will be of significant interest to clinicians involved
in the prevention and treatment of CVD.

Figure 2.
A. Forest plot of the association between third highest level of coffee consumption (median
consumption: 1.5 cups/d) and risk of CVD compared to the lowest level (median
consumption: 0 cup/d). The overall effect was obtained from a fixed-effects model that
accounted for correlated outcomes. MI means myocardial infarction incidence; CVD means
cardiovascular disease incidence; stroke means stroke incidence. B. Forest plot of the
association between second highest level of coffee consumption (median consumption: 3.5
cups/d) and risk of CVD compared to the lowest level (median consumption: 0 cups/d). The
overall effect was obtained from a fixed-effects model that accounted for correlated
outcomes. MI means myocardial infarction incidence; CVD means cardiovascular disease
incidence; stroke means stroke incidence. C. Forest plot of the association between highest
level of coffee consumption (median consumption: 7 cups/d) and risk of CVD compared to
the lowest level (median consumption: 0 cups/d). The overall effect was obtained from a
fixed-effects model that accounted for correlated outcomes. MI means myocardial infarction
incidence; CVD means cardiovascular disease incidence; stroke means stroke incidence.

Red Meat Consumption and the Risk of Stroke:

A Dose–Response Meta-analysis of Prospective Cohort Studies

Cuili Yang, MS,* Lei Pan, MS,† Chengcao Sun, PhD,* Yongyong Xi, MS,*

Liang Wang, MS,* and Dejia Li, PhD*

Background: Prospective studies of red meat consumption and risk of stroke have
provided inconsistent results. We aimed to assess this association by conducting a
meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies. Methods: Relevant studies were iden-
tiﬁed by searching PubMed and EMBASE through April 1, 2013. Summary relative
risks (RR) and the corresponding 95% conﬁdence intervals (CIs) were estimated by
random-effect or ﬁxed-effect models. Results: Seven prospective cohort studies were
included in the analyses, involving 2,079,236 subjects and 21,730 strokes cases. Total
red meat consumption was associated with total stroke (RR = 1.14, 95% CI 1.05-
1.24), cerebral infarction (RR = 1.13, 95% CI 1.0-1.28), and ischemic stroke (RR = 1.22,
95% CI 1.01-1.46). A signiﬁcant association was found between consumption of pro-
cessed red meat and total stroke (RR = 1.17, 95% CI 1.09-1.27). Consumption of fresh
red meat was signiﬁcantly associated with total stroke (RR = 1.13, 95% CI 1.04-
1.22) and ischemic stroke (RR = 1.15, 95% CI 1.03-1.29). However, no evidence suggests
that any type of meat was associated with hemorrhagic stroke. Also, no associa-
tion was found between consumption of processed red meat and ischemic stroke
(RR = 1.15, 95% CI .98-1.36) and between consumption of fresh red meat and
cerebral infarction (RR = 1.06, 95% CI [.94, 1.20]). A signiﬁcant risk for total
stroke could be observed when the consumption of total red meat was above 50 g/
day, processed red meat was just above 0 g/day, and fresh red meat was above
70 g/day. Conclusion: Our ﬁndings indicate that high consumption of red meat,
especially processed red meat, will increase the risk of stroke. Key Words:
Meat—stroke—prospective studies—meta-analysis—dose–response.

Introduction

As the global population aging process accelerates, stroke
brings great harm to middle aged and elderly people,
which aggravates the patient’s family and results in so-
cioeconomic burden. According to the American Heart
Association report, each year 795,000 people experience
a new or recurrent stroke and every 4 minutes someone
dies from the disease.1 Owing to the high incidence and
high mortality of stroke, the medical community ranks
it as 1 of 3 top diseases that threatens human health, along
with coronary heart disease and cancer.2-4

Strokes can be classiﬁed into 2 major categories: isch-
emic and hemorrhagic, and ischemic stroke is the
predominant type accounting for 87% of all cases.5 Isch-
emic stroke can also be divided into 2 main types:
thrombotic and embolic. Thrombotic stroke is clinically
referred to as cerebral thrombosis or cerebral infarction,
and this type of event is responsible for almost 50% of

Journal of Stroke and Cerebrovascular Diseases, Vol. 25, No. 5 (May), 2016: pp 1177–1186

all strokes. Owing to the category difference between ce-
rebral infarction and ischemic stroke, it can be inferred
that some factors that can cause ischemic stroke do not
necessarily cause cerebral infarction, so stroke can also
be divided into 3 types: cerebral infarction, hemorrhag-
ic stroke, and ischemic stroke.

Meat consumption accounts for a large part of the diet
and meat acts as a major source of protein, fat, and energy
for humans. However, the 2005 U.S. Dietary Guidelines
for Americans recommend that consumption of red and
processed meat should be moderated.6 Such recommen-
dations are in large part derived from epidemiological
evidence that high consumption of red meat was asso-
ciated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes, digestive
system disease, cancer, and cardiovascular disease.7-10 Re-
cently, red meat consumption as a potential risk for stroke
has been studied in 2 observational studies.11,12 However,
sufficient evidence for direct relationships between red
meat consumption and stroke has been lacking to support
more quantitative recommendations about speciﬁc con-
sumption levels of meats.

Accordingly, we performed a systematic review and
a meta-analysis of prospective studies to assess the re-
lation between consumption of red meat (fresh red meat,
processed meat, and total red meat) and the risk of total
stroke and stroke subtypes, which could not be ad-
dressed in the previous meta-analysis.

Subjects and Methods
Search Strategy

We performed a meta-analysis on the basis of guid-
ance of Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in
Epidemiology. We performed a comprehensive litera-
ture search on PubMed database through April 1, 2013,
by using key words such as “meat,” “red meat,” “pro-
cessed meat,” “meat products,” “beef,” “pork,” “lamb,”
“steak,” “mutton,” “cardiovascular disease,” “hemor-
rhagic stroke,” “ischemic stroke,” “mortalities,” “risk,”
“death,” “fatal,” and “incidence” (Fig 1). In addition, we
reviewed the reference lists of published articles to iden-
tify additional relevant studies. To obtain additional data
or main results for the meta-analysis, we contacted authors
of primary studies (Table 1).13-19

“Red meat” was deﬁned as unprocessed beef, pork and
lamb except for poultry, ﬁsh and eggs; “processed meat”
was mainly processed red meat such as bacon, baloney,
salami, hot dog, and luncheon meats except for ﬁsh and
eggs; “total red meat” was deﬁned as the total of these
2 categories.20,21 When possible, we conducted a linear
dose–response analysis of stroke risk per increment in
consumption of 100 g/day for red meat and 50 g/day for
processed meat using generalized least-squares trend es-
timation analysis developed by Greenland and
Longnecker.22

MEAT AND STROKE

Inclusion Criteria

Studies were included if these (1) had a prospective
cohort design; (2) deﬁned the exposure factors as con-
sumption of red meat, processed meat, or fresh meat
(unprocessed meat); (3) regarded different types of stroke
as primary outcome indicators; (4) presented hazard risk
(HR), relative risk (RR), or odds radio (OR) estimates with
95% conﬁdence intervals (CIs); and (5) regulated all par-
ticipants as middle aged and elderly people.

Exclusion Criteria

Studies were excluded if they (1) used other lan-
guages except for English; (2) were repetitive articles or
data; and (3) were articles such as comment, letter, review,
editorial, and animal studies.

Data Extraction and Quality Evaluation

The following data were extracted from each study:
author’s name, publication year, the experiment design,
study location, age range or mean age of the partici-
pants, gender, number of cases and cohort size, length
of follow-up, exposure range, RR with 95% CI of total
strokes and stroke subtypes for each category of meat
consumption. If the exposure factors included all types
of total meat, we selected only related information on
total red meat and red meat types. If the studies con-
tained total stroke, stroke types, strokes morbidity, and
mortality, we chose only the number of cases, the largest
sample, and the amount of information of the most com-
plete data. Study selection and data extraction were
conducted independently by 2 investigators (Yang and
Pan), with disagreements resolved by consensus.

We used the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale’s 9-star system
to evaluate the study quality. The scoring system sum-
marized 9 aspects of each study: representativeness of
the exposed cohort, selection of the unexposed cohort,
ascertainment of exposure, outcome of interest not present
at the start of study, control for important factors or ad-
ditional factors, outcome assessment, follow-up time long
enough for outcomes to occur, and adequacy of follow-
up of cohorts. Therefore, the full score was 9 stars, and
a study with 7 awarded stars was deﬁned as a high-
quality study.23

Statistical Analysis

All analyses were performed using Stata, version 11.0
(StataCorp, College Station, TX). The extracted RRs with
95% CI (highest compared to lowest red meat consumption)
were computed from adjusted RRs, HRs, and ORs (HR and
OR were directly considered as RR) to measure the as-
sociation between red meat consumption and the risk of
strokes.

Heterogeneity between the studies was assessed using
Q and I2 statistics. Because multiple factors such as par-

1181

ticipants, outcome indicators, and methodology may affect
the outcomes, we needed to do a heterogeneity test, and
if the heterogeneity was signiﬁcant, we needed to explore
its source. For the Q statistic, a P value less than .10 was
considered statistically signiﬁcant for heterogeneity. For
the I2 statistic, heterogeneity was interpreted as absent
(I2 = 0%-25%), low (I2 = 25.1%-50%), moderate (I2 = 50.1%-
75%), or high (I2 = 75.1%-100%); if I2 was 50% or above,
we need to choose a random-effect model to indicate the
obvious heterogeneity.24,25

A quantiﬁed dose–response relationship between total
red meat, processed red meat, fresh meat consumption,
and incidence of strokes was examined on the basis of
the principle of Greenland and Longnecker.22 The anal-
ysis used data from each category of average consumption,
number of cases and person years, and adjusted RR with
95% CI. Forest plots and funnel plots were used to examine
the overall effect and to assess the publication bias.26,27

Results
Literature Search and Study Characteristic

There were total 1467 citations identiﬁed through the
primary search. All studies were adjusted for age, smoking,
ﬁsh, fruits, vegetables, body mass index, and disease history.
Moreover, most studies also presented results on total
energy consumption, physical activity, education level, and
alcohol. After the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale’s 9-star system
analyses, the included articles reached 7 stars, and the
7 identiﬁed investigations were prospective cohorts. These
studies were conducted in the United States (3 articles),13,16,19
Sweden (2 articles),14,15 China (1 article),18 and Japan (1
article).17 A total of 2,079,236 unique individuals includ-
ing 21,730 stroke cases were involved (Table 1). The holistic
heterogeneity was low (I2 = 0%-54.5%) and there was no
indication of a publication bias, either from Egger’s test
(P = .780) or from Begg’s test (P > .05 for both tests).

Total Red Meat Consumption and Strokes

The meta-analysis of total red meat intake and total
stroke risk was based on 4 prospective cohort studies.
In the highest versus lowest model, we found that the
summary RR was 1.14 (95% CI 1.05-1.24). The heteroge-
neity test result showed no heterogeneity (I2 = 0, P = .504)
(Fig 2, A). The RR between total red meat consumption
and cerebral infarction was 1.13 (95% CI 1.0-1.28), and
the heterogeneity test result suggests there was no sta-
tistical signiﬁcance (I2 = 19.8%, P = .264) (Fig 2, B). The
RR between total red meat and hemorrhagic stroke was
1.18 (95% CI .93-1.50); the results of the heterogeneity test
indicate that the heterogeneity was moderate among the
studies (Fig 2, C). The RR between total red meat and
ischemic stroke was 1.22 (95% CI 1.01-1.46). The heter-
ogeneity test conducted showed no heterogeneity among
the studies (I2 = 0%, P = .534) (Fig 2, D).

MEAT AND STROKE

Processed Red Meat Consumption and Stroke

Four prospective cohort studies were included in the
highest model versus the lowest model; the meta-
analysis of processed red meat intake and total stroke
risk yielded a summary RR of 1.17 (95% CI 1.09-1.27).
No heterogeneity was detected (I2 = 0%, P = .464) (Fig 2,
A). The RR between processed red meat consumption and
hemorrhagic stroke was 1.15 (95% CI .92-1.44). The het-
erogeneity test performed (I2 = 18.6, P = .297) (Fig 2, C)
indicated that there was no signiﬁcant heterogeneity among
the studies. The RR between processed red meat and isch-
emic stroke was 1.15 (95% CI .98-1.36). Low heterogeneity
was detected (I2 = 27.6%, P = .24) (Fig 2, D).

Fresh Red Meat and Strokes

Five prospective cohort studies of fresh red meat dis-
tinction were included in the meta-analysis. In the highest
model versus the lowest model, the summary RR was
1.13 (95% CI 1.04-1.22), and heterogeneity was absent
(I2 = 0%, P = .826) (Fig 2, A). The risk between fresh red
meat and cerebral infarction was 1.06 (95% CI .94-1.20).
No heterogeneity was detected (I2 = 0%, P = .451) (Fig 2,
B). The RR between fresh red meat and hemorrhagic stroke
was .88 (95% CI .73-1.06). Low heterogeneity was de-
tected (I2 = 43.7%, P = .1) (Fig 2, C).The RR between fresh
red meat and ischemic stroke was 1.15 (95% CI 1.03-1.29).
No heterogeneity was detected (I2 = 0, P = .552) (Fig 2, D).

Dose–Response Meta-analysis

Three studies were combined to conduct the dose–
response meta-analysis on red meat consumption and total
stroke. The dose–response analysis indicated that there
was no risk for total stroke if the total red meat con-
sumption was below 50 g/day; however, if the total red
meat consumption was above 50 g/day, a signiﬁcant risk
could be observed (Fig 3, A). The consumption of pro-
cessed red meat was suggested to be signiﬁcantly associated
with higher risk of total stroke if the dose was above 0 g/day
(Fig 3, B). There was no risk for total stroke if the con-
sumption of processed red meat was below 70 g/day;
however, consumption of processed red meat above
70 g/day was related to total risk signiﬁcantly (Fig 3, C).22

Publication Bias

Begg and Egger tests indicated no evidence of publi-
cation bias with regard to total red meat consumption
in relation to the risk of total stroke (Fig 4).

Discussion

This meta-analysis of 7 prospective studies, including
a large number of stroke cases, showed that there is a
potential association between red meat consumption and
stroke. Consumption of total red meat was associated with

total stroke, cerebral infarction, and ischemic stroke. There
was a signiﬁcant association between processed red meat
consumption and total stroke. Fresh red meat consump-
tion was signiﬁcantly associated with total stroke and
ischemic stroke. However, no statistically signiﬁcant as-
sociations were observed for hemorrhagic stroke. Also,
no association was observed between consumption of pro-
cessed red meat and ischemic stroke and between
consumption of fresh red meat and cerebral infarction.
A signiﬁcant risk for total stroke could be observed when
the consumption of the total red meat was above 50 g/day,
processed red meat consumption was just above 0 g/day,
and fresh red meat was above 70 g/day.

The mechanism why much red meat consumption leads
to stroke may be explained by several potential biochem-
ical views. Red meat contains abundant heme iron, and
heme iron can contribute to endogenous formation of
N-nitroso compounds,28 which has been linked to car-
diovascular disease and stroke in epidemiological studies.29,30
In experimental studies, nitrates and their by-products
have been suggested to promote atherosclerosis and vas-
cular dysfunction31 and to reduce insulin secretion,32,33 all
of which may contribute to increase the risk of stroke.
And oxidative stress and DNA damage caused by iron
are also thought to be risk factors for stroke.34,35 In ad-
dition, red meat contains high amounts of saturated fatty
acids and cholesterol, which have been shown to have

adverse effects on serum lipid proﬁles and subse-
quently may increase the risk of stroke.36-38

High consumption of red meat has been suggested to
negatively impact on human health, but too less red meat
consumption is also harmful. Red meat has been long
established as an important dietary source of protein and
essential nutrients including iron, zinc, and vitamin B12.39,40
As described above, red meat is a major source of heme
iron. Iron is vital for many cellular processes in the body
and, as a component of hemoglobin, is essential to main-
taining adequate transport of oxygen in the blood.28 Iron-
deﬁciency anemia is the most common nutritional
deﬁciency worldwide, being particularly prevalent among
children and young women.41 And anemia is known to
be one of the causes of stroke.42 All in all, moderate con-
sumption of red meat as part of a balanced diet may
positively inﬂuence nutrient intake, whereas too less red
meat consumption will not be beneﬁcial for human long-
term health.

The strength of our study lies in a large sample size
(2,079,236 subjects and 21,730 strokes cases) and no
signiﬁcant evidence of publication bias. Furthermore,
all the original studies included in this meta-analysis
were high-quality research and had a prospective cohort
design. In addition, we used the nonlinear curve ﬁtting
method to analyze the dose–response, which is more
accurate and credible.

MEAT AND STROKE

Although we have tried our best to get more precise
conclusions, there still exist several limitations. First, most
of population data were obtained from questionnaires,
while different questionnaire designs had some loop-
holes. During the implementation of the questionnaire,
the number of participants was so large that the ques-
tionnaire was difficult to spread, and thus questionnaire
quality was not guaranteed. Second, lifestyle plays an im-
portant role. Unhealthy lifestyle such as smoking, alcohol,
physical inactivity, and overeating salty foods may affect
the reliability of the results. These confounding factors
tend to exaggerate the risk between red meat and stroke.43,44
Next, some diseases like heart diseases, diabetes melli-
tus, and hypertension will increase the risk of stroke. Heart
disease patients are prone to have thrombus, which may
cause a stroke; diabetes patients not only are prone to
develop blood lipid metabolic disorders, which aggra-
vate atherosclerosis, but also are prone to suffer from
hypertension, which is a risk factor for stroke. A sudden
change in the blood pressure of hypertensive patients will
lead to a stroke.45-47 Lastly, during the long follow-up, the
participants may have changed their diets. The partici-
pants may have adjusted to a healthy diet structure in
which the red meat consumption was reduced. All in all,
these potential factors are likely to impact the results.

Conclusion

In summary, our meta-analysis supports that the con-
sumption of fresh red meat, processed red meat, and total
red meat has a signiﬁcant association with risk for total
stroke and ischemic stroke except for hemorrhagic stroke.
However, the association between red meat and cere-
bral infarction has not been clearly conﬁrmed. In addition,
the dose–response analysis demonstrates that the con-
sumption of processed red meat and total red meat rather
than fresh red meat is consistently associated with the
risk of stroke in a nonlinear fashion. These results indi-
cate that high consumption of red meat, especially
processed red meat will increase the risk of stroke.

Abstract
Objective To assess the effect of reduction or
modification of dietary fat intake on total and
cardiovascular mortality and cardiovascular morbidity.
Design Systematic review.
Data sources Cochrane Library, Medline, Embase,
CAB abstracts, SIGLE, CVRCT registry, and
biographies were searched; trials known to experts
were included.
Included studies Randomised controlled trials stating
intention to reduce or modify fat or cholesterol intake
in healthy adult participants over at least six months.
Inclusion decisions, validity, and data extraction were
duplicated. Meta›analysis (random effects
methodology), meta›regression, and funnel plots were
performed.
Results 27 studies (30 902 person years of
observation) were included. Alteration of dietary fat
intake had small effects on total mortality (rate ratio
0.98; 95% confidence interval 0.86 to 1.12).
Cardiovascular mortality was reduced by 9% (0.91;
0.77 to 1.07) and cardiovascular events by 16% (0.84;
0.72 to 0.99), which was attenuated (0.86; 0.72 to 1.03)
in a sensitivity analysis that excluded a trial using oily
fish. Trials with at least two years’ follow up provided
stronger evidence of protection from cardiovascular
events (0.76; 0.65 to 0.90).
Conclusions There is a small but potentially
important reduction in cardiovascular risk with
reduction or modification of dietary fat intake, seen
particularly in trials of longer duration.

Introduction
For half a century the relation between dietary fat and
cardiovascular disease, the “diet›heart” hypothesis, has
been a central tenet of strategies for risk reduction in
individuals and populations.1 Observational studies2

evidence of a beneficial effect in observational studies

Previous investigators have extrapolated the reduc›
tion in coronary heart disease that might be expected
from changes in blood cholesterol concentration,4 7
even though there is direct evidence from randomised
controlled trials of the effect of modification or reduc›
tion of intake of dietary fats. We therefore performed a
systematic review to assess the effect of change in
dietary fat intake, which would be expected to result in
a lowering of cholesterol concentration, on mortality
and cardiovascular morbidity, using all available
randomised clinical trials. The interventions included
any of the following: reduction in intake of total fat;
reduction in intake of saturated fat; reduction in intake
of dietary cholesterol; or a shift from saturated to
unsaturated fat.

Methods
Much of
the methodology has been reported
previously.9 Briefly, we developed a search strategy to
search for nutrition based randomised controlled trials
on the Cochrane Library, Medline, Embase, CAB
abstracts, CVRCT registry (inception of database to
mid›1998), and SIGLE (January 1999). We searched
bibliographies and contacted related Cochrane Review
Groups and 60 experts (May 1999) for further trials.
There were no language restrictions.

The inclusion criteria were adequate randomisa›
tion; usual or control diet or placebo group; stated aim
of intervention was reduction or modification of intake
of dietary fat or cholesterol, unless the intervention was
exclusively omega 3 fatty acids; intervention was not
multifactorial;
the intervention group were not
children, acutely ill, or pregnant; the intervention (diet
provided or supplementation) continued for at least six
months or follow up (after dietary advice) was at least
six months; and data on mortality or cardiovascular
morbidity were available.

Our primary outcomes of interest were effects of
intervention on total mortality, cardiovascular mor›
tality, combined cardiovascular events (including all
available data on cardiovascular deaths, non›fatal myo›
cardial infarction, stroke, angina, heart failure, periph›
eral vascular disease, angioplasty, and coronary artery
bypass grafting), and quality of life. Event data were
included only when they occurred during provision of
diet or supplement (when these were provided) or

while randomisation and blinding were maintained (in
dietary advice trials).

Inclusion was assessed independently by two asses›
sors (LH, RLT) and differences were resolved by
discussion, with, if necessary, a third reviewer (RAR).
Data extracted independently in duplicate (by LH and
RLT) included type of participants, interventions, and
outcomes; characteristics of trial quality; numbers of
events; total patient years in trial; and data on potential
effect modifiers. Effect modifiers included participants’
baseline risk of cardiovascular disease, trial duration,
mode of intervention, change in intake of dietary fats,
and serum cholesterol concentration achieved.

Criteria for assessment of trial quality included
method of randomisation, physician blinding, partici›
pant blinding, and any systematic difference in care
between the intervention groups.

initial

intervention,

We used meta›analysis to explore the primary
hypothesis, which was that reduction or modification of
dietary fat intake affects mortality, cardiovascular mor›
tality, and cardiovascular events. We examined the
effects of duration of
level of
cardiovascular risk and dietary fat intake, type of inter›
vention, and changes in intake of
total, saturated,
monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated fats and blood
cholesterol concentration using subgrouping of trials
and meta›regression. We excluded trials that aimed to
alter omega 3 intake as the method of action (if any) is
probably different
from any action caused by the
reduction in intake of total or saturated fat—that is,
it does not primarily lower low density lipoprotein
cholesterol.

Treatment effect was measured as a rate ratio and
meta›analysis performed as a weighted average of log
rate ratios.10 The meta›analysis used random effects
methodology11 within S›PLUS.12 Meta›analysis pools
results of individual trials, with weighting so that results
with higher precision (related to sample size)
contribute more to the combined outcome. We used
the STATA command metareg13 for random effects
meta›regression.14 Meta›regression investigates
the
effect of one or more study characteristics on the size
of treatment effect, taking precision into account. A
genuine relation may be inferred (for example, if the
extent of reduction in total
fat achieved by the
intervention is associated with the degree of reduction
in mortality) when a slope is significantly different from
zero. We used funnel plot asymmetry to detect any bias
in the trials retrieved.15

Results
Study characteristics
We identified 27 studies, comprising 40 distinct
intervention arms over 30 902 person years of
observation.16–42 A table with details of all 27 studies can
be found on the BMJ ’s website. Figure 1 gives a flow
chart of studies assessed and excluded at various stages
of the review. Table 1 gives details of extracted data. We
found almost no data on quality of life or levels of trans
fats. The ♭ statistic for inter›rater agreement on
inclusion or exclusion of potential trials was 0.61.43

(fig 2). The data on cardiovascular
mortality indicate a slight (9%) protection from modi›
fication of intake of dietary fat (0.91; 0.77 to 1.07) (fig 3)
and a 16% reduction in cardiovascular events (0.84;
0.72 to 0.99) (fig 4). A funnel plot of effect size versus
sample size did not show any evidence of bias (data not
shown).

The Oslo diet›heart trial provided some oily fish (a
source of omega 3 fatty acids) to participants in the
intervention group.33 Exclusion of the results of this
trial attenuated the rate ratios for all
three main
outcomes (total mortality 1.02 (0.91 to 1.14); cardio›
vascular mortality 0.94 (0.79 to 1.11); combined
cardiovascular events 0.86 (0.72 to 1.03)).

Figure 5 shows the results of the meta›analyses,
subgroupings, and sensitivity analyses performed.
Table 2 shows the results of the meta›regressions.

Duration of follow up, initial level of cardiovascular
risk, type of intervention, and dietary fat intake at
baseline
We obtained results for specific length of time on diet,
initial level of cardiovascular risk, or mode of interven›
tion through subgrouping of trials. Trials in which the
mean length of follow up exceeded two years showed
somewhat larger reductions in combined cardiovas›
cular events (0.76 (0.65 to 0.90) v 0.96 (0.75 to 1.23)
than trials of less than two years’ duration). When we
excluded data from the Oslo diet›heart study, the rate
ratio for combined cardiovascular events for trials with
mean follow up longer than two years was not altered
(0.77; 0.62 to 0.96). Total mortality was not substantially

suggests fewer cardiovascular events at longer mean
follow up times in the groups with reduced or modified
fat intake.

Trials with participants at high initial cardiovas›
cular risk suggested very similar levels of protection
from combined cardiovascular events (rate ratio 0.84;
0.70 to 0.99) as did trials with participants at low
cardiovascular risk (0.82; 0.56 to 1.20). Neither the
method of dietary modification (by diet advice, advice
plus a supplement, or diet provided) nor the initial
level of intake of dietary fat influenced rate ratios.

Changes in fat intake and blood cholesterol
concentration
We used meta›regression to explore the effects on total
mortality and combined cardiovascular events of chang›
ing the proportion of energy from total fat and of alter›
ing serum cholesterol concentrations. Meta›regressions
also explored the relation between change in pro›
portion of saturated fat, polyunsaturated fat, and
monounsaturated fat on cardiovascular events. These
suggested that total mortality and cardiovascular events
were reduced as energy from fat, and as serum
cholesterol concentrations, fell. Similarly, cardiovascular

decreased. However, none of
these relations were
convincing (none of the slopes were different from zero
at a P < 0.05, see table 2), except for that of monounsatu›

medium sized trial, St Thomas’s

treated with caution.

trials

Exclusion of data from the Oslo diet study33 attenu›
ated the effects on cardiovascular events. In this trial
participants in the intervention group were supplied
with oily fish, in addition to dietary advice. Oily fish,
which is rich in omega 3 fatty acids, seems to have

independent beneficial effects,44 so the benefits seen in
this trial may have been due to the fish oils and not to
cholesterol lowering or alterations in other dietary fats.

Duration of trial effect
Subgrouping by length of mean follow up suggests
that virtually all protection from cardiovascular events
occurs in trials of at least two years’ duration. In trials
with mean follow up of two years or less the reduction
in events was only 4%, whereas in trials with longer fol›
low up reductions of up to 24% were seen. This effect
was confirmed in a meta›regression.

The division at two years was chosen after we stud›
ied initial data from the Scandinavian simvastatin sur›
vival study (4S), which assessed the effect of simvastatin
on mortality and morbidity after myocardial infarc›
tion.45 In that study little difference in event rates
between treated and control groups emerged until
after two years. The similar time lag between the effects
of dietary intervention and statins suggests a common
mechanism, perhaps through effects on the scale, type,
and stability of atherosclerotic plaques (rather than
rapid alteration in blood coagulability), but other
mechanisms may also be operating.

the duration of

It is not clear whether it is the duration of the inter›
the follow up that
vention or
determines whether
the intervention is effective.
Sustained change in dietary behaviour, promoted by
long interventions, is probably necessary to achieve
reduction in cardiovascular events, and lengthy follow
up is probably required before pathophysiological
changes that reduce clinical events are observed.

Initial level of cardiovascular risk
Subgrouping suggested no effect of initial level of risk
on outcomes. Both high and low risk groups had a
similar level of risk reduction for combined cardiovas›
cular events. This is in contrast to results of previous
studies,46 though initial levels of risk in studies in this
systematic review were generally high (people in
control group at “low risk” of cardiovascular events suf›
fered 2.57 events per 100 people per year and those at
“high risk” 7.62 events per 100 people per year).

Most of the events in this review occurred in men.
Only two trials with events included women29 42 so it
may not be appropriate to generalise these results to
women.

Type of intervention
Subgrouping by mode of intervention showed no ben›
efit of providing the entire diet compared with dietary
advice or advice and a supplement. This was surprising
as we expected that provision of food would have a
more powerful effect on events than dietary advice
alone.

Changes in blood cholesterol concentration
Meta›regression provided weak evidence that a greater
reduction in serum cholesterol concentrations in the
intervention group compared with the control group
resulted in a slightly greater reduction in cardiovas›
cular events and mortality.

A reduction of over 20% in total serum cholesterol
concentration can result in a 25% fall in mortality from
coronary heart disease.47 Within dietary trials in this
review the mean initial serum cholesterol concentra›
tion was 5.8 mmol/l, with a fall of 0.64 mmol/l (11%).
This degree of reduction is similar to that achieved by

early fibrates, which show reductions in rates of coron›
ary heart disease only among those at high risk.46 How›
ever, early fibrates seemed to increase mortality from
other causes, and hence any benefit from this reduction
in cholesterol concentration was outweighed by
adverse effects of the drugs themselves. In dietary
modification this degree of cholesterol
lowering is
probably of modest overall benefit.

Methodology of the review
In this review we aimed to find trials that modified or
reduced dietary fat intake for at least six months, even
when mortality and morbidity were not reported. We
tried to contact trial authors to ascertain whether it was
known if any deaths or cardiovascular events had
occurred. For this reason, many of the included trials
are small but are included in the hope of augmenting
the data from larger trials and reducing bias. Although
small trials cannot individually hope to achieve useful
data on rare events, in meta›analysis we are increasing
the power of the group of studies by pooling.

We included factorial trials (for example, the diet
and reinfarction trial (DART)17) when it was possible to
separate out the data on the effect of change in dietary
fat from the other interventions (which are randomly
distributed across the fat control and intervention
groups). We excluded multiple risk factor intervention
trials as it is not possible to disaggregate the effects of
change in dietary fat intake from other, potentially
effective interventions such as increasing exercise,
stopping smoking, and change in other dietary
constituents. There is already a systematic review on
this topic.48 We excluded the Lyon heart study49 as
inclusion in our review was decided by the stated
intention of the trial.49 This trial nowhere states the
intention to reduce or modify dietary fat intake and the
major effect on diet was to increase the omega 3 fat
intake. We excluded the Finnish mental hospital study50
as it was not a truly randomised design (a cluster
randomised trial with only two clusters).

Although we amassed 30 902 person years of
observation, 1430 deaths, and 1216 cardiovascular
events, considerable uncertainty exists over the size of
effects and the means by which they were achieved
given the scarcity of trials longer than two years’ dura›
tion. It is unlikely that further resources will now be
forthcoming to perform a large trial of dietary modifi›
cation. Consequently the evidence pooled in this
review contributes all that is available to guide clinical
practice and health policy on dietary manipulation.
However, publication of data on deaths or cardio›

What is already known on this topic
The epidemiological relation between dietary fat intake and
cardiovascular disease is central in strategies aimed at risk reduction in
populations and individuals

Systematic review of randomised controlled trials supports
manipulation of dietary fat to control serum lipid concentrations,
though evidence of effect on one risk factor does not rule out an
opposite or reinforced effect on another unstudied risk factor

Randomised controlled trials of dietary fat reduction or modification
have shown varying results on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality
What this study adds
Systematic review of trials of modified fat intake shows that reduction
or modification of dietary fat intake results in reductions in
cardiovascular events, but only in trials of at least two years’ duration

There is little effect on total mortality

Despite decades of effort and many thousands of people randomised,
there is still only limited and inconclusive evidence of the effects of
modification of total, saturated, monounsaturated, or polyunsaturated
fats on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality

a suggestion that less total fat or less of any individual
fatty acid fraction in the diet is beneficial.

The findings on cardiovascular events are broadly
in keeping with benefits that might be expected from
modest lowering of cholesterol concentration and cer›
tainly provide support, at an individual level, for the
central role of dietary fat intake in the causation of
cardiovascular disease.

The effectiveness of exercise as an intervention in the
management of depression: systematic review and
meta›regression analysis of randomised controlled trials
Debbie A Lawlor, Stephen W Hopker

Abstract
Objective To determine the effectiveness of exercise
as an intervention in the management of depression.
Design Systematic review and meta›regression
analysis of randomised controlled trials obtained from
five electronic databases (Medline, Embase, Sports
Discus, PsycLIT, Cochrane Library) and through
contact with experts in the field, bibliographic
searches, and hand searches of recent copies of
relevant journals.
Main outcome measures Standardised mean
difference in effect size and weighted mean difference
in Beck depression inventory score between exercise
and no treatment and between exercise and cognitive
therapy.
Results All of the 14 studies analysed had important
methodological weaknesses; randomisation was
adequately concealed in only three studies, intention
to treat analysis was undertaken in only two, and
assessment of outcome was blinded in only one. The
participants in most studies were community
volunteers, and diagnosis was determined by their
score on the Beck depression inventory. When
compared with no treatment, exercise reduced
symptoms of depression (standardised mean
difference in effect size –1.1 (95% confidence interval
–1.5 to –0.6); weighted mean difference in Beck
depression inventory –7.3 (–10.0 to –4.6)). The effect
size was significantly greater in those trials with
shorter follow up and in two trials reported only as
conference abstracts. The effect of exercise was similar
to that of cognitive therapy (standardised mean
difference –0.3 (95% confidence interval –0.7 to 0.1)).
Conclusions The effectiveness of exercise in reducing
symptoms of depression cannot be determined
because of a lack of good quality research on clinical
populations with adequate follow up.

Introduction
Depression is a common and important cause of mor›
bidity and mortality worldwide. The effect of exercise
on depression has been the subject of research for sev›
eral decades, and the literature on the subject is grow›
ing.1 In the past decade “exercise on prescription”
schemes have become popular in primary care in the
United Kingdom,2 many of which include depression
as a referral criterion.

Several plausible mechanisms for how exercise
affects depression have been proposed.
In the
developed world taking regular exercise is seen as a
virtue; the depressed patient who takes regular exercise
may, as a result, get positive feedback from other
people and an increased sense of self worth. Exercise
may act as a diversion from negative thoughts, and the
mastery of a new skill may be important.3 4 Social con›
tact may be an important mechanism, and physical
activity may have physiological effects such as changes
in endorphin and monoamine concentrations.5 6

A higher ratio of beans to white rice is associated with lower
cardiometabolic risk factors in Costa Rican adults1–3

Josiemer Mattei, Frank B Hu, and Hannia Campos

ABSTRACT
Background: A high intake of white rice is associated with the
metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes. Costa Ricans follow a sta-
ple dietary pattern that includes white rice and beans, yet the com-
bined role of these foods on cardiometabolic risk factors has not
been studied.
Objective: We aimed to determine the association between intake
of white rice and beans and the metabolic syndrome and its com-
ponents in Costa Rican adults (n = 1879) without diabetes.
Design: Multivariate-adjusted means were calculated for compo-
nents of the metabolic syndrome by daily servings of white rice
and beans (,1, 1, or .1) and by the ratio of beans to white rice.
The OR for the metabolic syndrome was calculated by substituting
one serving of beans for one serving of white rice.
Results: An increase in daily servings of white rice was positively
associated with systolic blood pressure (BP), triglycerides, and fast-
ing glucose and inversely associated with HDL cholesterol (P-trend
,0.01 for all). An increase in servings of beans was inversely
associated with diastolic BP (P = 0.049). Signiﬁcant trends for
higher HDL cholesterol and lower BP and triglycerides were ob-
served for 1:3, 1:2, 1:1, and 2:1 ratios of beans to white rice.
Substituting one serving of beans for one serving of white rice
was associated with a 35% (95% CI: 15%, 50%) lower risk of the
metabolic syndrome.
Conclusion: Increasing the ratio of beans to white rice, or limiting
the intake of white rice by substituting beans, may lower cardiome-
tabolic risk factors.

INTRODUCTION

White rice is a staple food across the world. In Latin America
countries, per capita consumption of white rice has tripled in the
past 60 y, becoming the most popular grain and replacing many of
the endogenous crops (1). Despite its widespread use, white rice
has been the focal point of recent studies and has been shown to
be associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes (2–4).
White rice is a reﬁned processed carbohydrate with a high
glycemic index and glycemic load (5); the strong postprandrial
rise in blood glucose in response to its consumption and the loss
of magnesium, dietary ﬁber, and other phytonutrients during
processing may explain its association with diabetes (2, 6).

In contrast with the ﬁndings with white rice, intake of legumes
has been associated with a protective effect against chronic dis-
eases through various mechanisms. Legumes are low in saturated
fat, have a low glycemic index, have a high mineral availability,
and have a high content of dietary ﬁber, a-linolenic acid, and

protein (7, 8). Speciﬁcally, an increased intake of beans has been
shown to be associated with a lower risk of myocardial in-
farction (9); lower serum total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol,
body weight, and systolic BP;4 and a smaller waist circumfer-
ence (10, 11), which are established biomarkers for cardiovas-
cular disease, the metabolic syndrome, and type 2 diabetes.

In most Latin American countries, people traditionally con-
sume white rice in combination with beans. A staple dietary
pattern that included white rice and beans was identiﬁed in Costa
Rican adults (12). Whereas white rice represents the main source
of energy in Costa Ricans (13, 14), and beans are a major source
of protein, the intake of beans has been declining with urbani-
zation (15). Because the prevalence of diabetes is increasing
worldwide (16), with a 140% increase expected by 2025 in Costa
Rica (17), it is imperative to understand the potential contrasting
effects of white rice and beans on risk factors for diabetes, such as
the metabolic syndrome, especially in populations with sub-
stantial consumption of both foods. Yet, the combined association
of these foods on cardiometabolic risk factors has not been
studied. Thus, we aimed to determine the association between
intake of white rice and beans and the metabolic syndrome and its
components in Costa Rican adults without type 2 diabetes.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS

Study population

This study included control subjects who participated in
a population-based case-control study of heart disease conducted
in Costa Rica from 1994 to 2004 (14, 18). Control subjects were
randomly selected by using data from the National Census and
Statistics Bureau of Costa Rica, matched for age (65 y), sex, and
area of residence (county) to case survivors of a ﬁrst acute
myocardial infarction. Control subjects were excluded if they
had ever had a myocardial infarction or if they were physically
or mentally unable to participate. The participation rate for

reﬂect revised guidelines (24). Subjects using medication for
hypertension or diabetes were considered to meet the criteria for
elevated BP and impaired fasting glucose, respectively.

Data collection

Details of the methods were described previously (9, 18, 19).
Brieﬂy, trained personnel conducted home interviews to assess
sociodemographic characteristics, lifestyles behaviors, and med-
ical histories using a close-ended questionnaire. Anthropometric
measurements, including weight, height, waist circumference, and
BP were measured in duplicate, whereas the subjects wore light
clothing and no shoes; the average was recorded. BMI was cal-
culated by dividing the weight by the squared height of a subject
(kg/m2). Total physical activity was calculated by multiplying the
frequency, duration, and intensity (in metabolic equivalents) of
each physical activity level and then summing up energy expen-
diture from all activities. The subjects provided a blood sample
after fasting overnight. Blood samples were collected into tubes
containing 0.1% EDTA and were stored in a cooler at 4°C to be
transported to the ﬁeldwork station within 4 h. Blood was
centrifuged at 1430 · g for 20 min at 4°C to separate plasma.
Plasma samples were stored at 280°C and, within 6 mo of
collection, were transported over dry ice to the Harvard School
of Public Health for analysis. Plasma triacylglycerol and HDL
cholesterol were measured enzymatically (Boehringer-Man-
nheim) by using a Roche Cobas Mira Plus autoanalyzer (Roche
Diagnostics Systems). Blood glucose was measured by using
Accu-Check II Blood Glucose Monitor with Chemstrip bG Test
Strips (Boehringer-Mannheim).

Dietary assessment

Dietary data were collected with a semiquantitative FFQ that
was developed and validated speciﬁcally for Costa Ricans (20).
Standardized serving sizes were obtained from the School of
Nutrition at the University of Costa Rica (21). The FFQ asked the
subjects to specify the portion size and frequency of white rice
and bean intakes by asking how frequently they consumed
a serving of each food during the previous years. Categories for
frequency were ,1 time/mo or never, 1–3 times/mo, 1 time/wk,
2–4 times/wk, 5–6 times/wk, 1 time/d, 2–3 times/d, 4–5 times/d,
and 6 times/d. A serving of rice corresponds to 0.66 cups
(;150 g), and a serving of beans corresponds to 0.33 cups (;86 g).
Mixed dishes containing either food (ie, gallopinto) were not in-
cluded because consumption is relatively low in the studied pop-
ulation (median intake: 1 serving/wk) compared with that of beans
and white rice alone. The FFQ also asked subjects about the type
of oil used for cooking and frying at home and the duration of use
(22). Reported nutrient intake is hereby referred to as “intake.”

Metabolic syndrome
Metabolic syndrome was deﬁned according to ATPIII guide-
lines (23). A subject with the metabolic syndrome met 3 of the
following criteria: abdominal obesity (.102 cm in men, .88 cm
in women), elevated BP (.130/85 mm Hg), high triglycerides
(1.69 mmol/L, or 150 mg/dL), low HDL cholesterol (men:
,1.03 mmol/L, or 40 mg/dL; women: ,1.29 mmol/L or 50 mg/
dL), and impaired fasting glucose (5.6 mmol/L, or 100 mg/dL).
Fasting glucose criteria was lowered from the original cutoff to

Statistical analysis

The analysis was conducted by using SAS software version 9.1
(SAS Institute Inc). Of the 2270 control subjects with available
FFQ data, 328 were excluded for a history of diabetes. After
subjects with missing data on the metabolic syndrome and po-
tential covariates were excluded, 1879 control subjects were
available and were included in this analysis. The frequency of
intake of daily servings of white rice and beans was deﬁned
according to 3 categories: ,1 time/d, 1 time/d, or .1 time/d. A
variable for the ratio of beans to white rice (daily servings) was
created by using the following categories: 1:3, 1:2, 1:1, and 2:1
servings. Individual nutrients were adjusted for total energy
intake by using the regression residual method (25, 26). Quin-
tiles were created for continuous energy-adjusted nutrient vari-
ables and other continuous covariates. Values of plasma glucose
and triacylglycerols were log-transformed to restore normal
distribution.

Differences in the distribution of sociodemographic, lifestyle,
dietary, and physiologic factors by metabolic syndrome status
were tested by using t tests for continuous variables and chi-
square tests for categorical variables. Age-adjusted differences
in distribution for those same measures, by categories of daily
servings of white rice and beans, were calculated by ANOVA.
Multivariate linear regression was used to obtain adjusted means
for components of the metabolic syndrome by daily servings of
white rice or beans. Potential confounders tested in the models
included age, sex, area of residence, income, alcohol intake,
smoking status, physical activity, ﬁber intake, type of cooking
oil, and total energy; white rice was added as a covariate when
differences in outcomes by bean intake were tested. The other
models tested did not differ from those shown. P-trend values by
increasing categories of white rice or bean intake and by the
ratio of beans to white rice were determined by assigning the
median of each category to a subject in the respective category
of intake or ratio and then entering the resulting continuous
variable into the model.

ORs and 95% CIs for the metabolic syndrome and its com-
ponents were estimated for substituting one serving of beans for
one serving of white rice, as previously described (2). Brieﬂy,
white rice and beans were included as continuous variables in the
same model. The difference between regression coefﬁcients was
used to derive the OR for the substitution. The substitution analysis,
based on statistical modeling of observational data, estimated the
potential effect of substituting one macronutrient or food for an-
other while holding total energy intake constant. Although such an
analysis does not provide direct evidence for causality, it fosters the
design of nutrition intervention studies to test the hypothesis. All
tests were considered signiﬁcant at P , 0.05.

RESULTS

The general characteristics of the study participants by
metabolic syndrome status are shown in Table 1. Nearly 30%
of the control subjects without previously reported type 2 di-
abetes met

the criteria for the metabolic syndrome;

subjects were more likely to be women and older and less
likely to smoke and be physically active. Subjects with the
metabolic syndrome consumed fewer calories and beans and
were more likely to use corn or sunﬂower oil for cooking in-
stead of palm oil.

Age-adjusted characteristics across categories of daily serv-
ings of white rice and beans to evaluate potential confounding
factors are shown in Table 2. Nearly 63% of subjects reported
consuming .1 serving of white rice per day, whereas only 39%
reported consuming beans at that frequency. Those consuming
more daily servings of white rice were younger, had lower in-
comes, and were more likely to be men, live in rural areas,
smoke, and be more physically active. The distribution for those
characteristics across daily servings of beans was similar as for
white rice, except for age, for which no signiﬁcant differences
were observed. Higher intakes of energy, total carbohydrates,
dietary ﬁber, beans, and palm and soy oil but lower intakes of
alcohol and corn/sunﬂower oil were observed for increasing
daily servings of white rice. Similar trends were observed for
intake of beans, except for the use of soy oil (NS). Those con-

suming .1 serving white rice/d had a lower BMI and HDL
cholesterol, but a higher systolic BP and fasting glucose; those
at this same frequency of intake of beans had a lower BMI,
waist circumference, diastolic BP, HDL cholesterol, and preva-
lence of the metabolic syndrome.

Multivariate-adjusted means for components of the metabolic
syndrome by daily servings of white rice and beans are shown in
Table 3. After control for potential covariates, including BMI,
a trend for higher systolic BP, plasma triglycerides, and fasting
glucose but a lower HDL cholesterol was observed by increasing
daily servings of white rice. An increase in daily servings of
beans was associated with a trend for lower waist circumference,
diastolic BP, and plasma triglycerides and higher HDL choles-
terol, after adjustment for all covariates except BMI. Only
a trend for lower diastolic BP remained signiﬁcant (P-trend =
0.049) after control for BMI.

Multivariate analysis was conducted to determine the asso-
ciation between cardiometabolic components and the ratio of
daily servings of beans to white rice (Figure 1). Signiﬁcant
trends were observed for higher HDL cholesterol (P-trend =

0.001) and for lower systolic BP (P-trend = 0.020), diastolic BP
(P-trend = 0.015), and plasma triglycerides (P-trend = 0.010)
with increasing ratios of beans to white rice, after adjustment for
potential confounders, including BMI. Subjects who consumed
a ratio of 2 servings of beans to 1 serving of white rice had lower
plasma triglycerides than did those who consumed 1:1, 1:2, and
1:3 servings of beans to white rice [154 (21, 24) compared with
185 (12, 12), 188 (13, 14), and 201 (17, 18), respectively].
Compared with subjects who consumed a ratio of one serving of
beans to one serving of white rice, those who consumed a 1:3
ratio had a signiﬁcantly higher diastolic BP [80 (0.1) compared
with 78 (0.7)] but a lower HDL cholesterol concentration [41
(0.8) compared with 43 (0.6)]; no signiﬁcant differences were
observed against the highest ratio.

After adjustment for potential covariates, the substitution of
one serving of beans for one serving of white rice was associated
with a 35% (95% CI: 15, 50%) lower odds of having the met-
abolic syndrome, a 33% (95% CI: 14, 49) reduction in the
likelihood of having a low HDL cholesterol concentration, and
a 45% (95% CI: 10, 66) lower odds of having an elevated fasting
glucose concentration, as deﬁned by ATPIII guidelines (Figure
2). Adjustment for BMI attenuated these associations slightly,
but they remained signiﬁcant (data not shown). No other car-
diometabolic component showed a signiﬁcant association from
the substitution of beans for white rice.

DISCUSSION

This study showed that increasing the ratio of beans to white
rice to 2:1 daily servings, or limiting the intake of white rice by
substituting beans, may lower cardiometabolic risk factors. We
reported a signiﬁcant adverse association of increasing daily
servings of white rice and a protective association of higher
intakes of beans on components of the metabolic syndrome—
a risk factor for type 2 diabetes. Speciﬁcally, a higher frequency
of servings of white rice was associated with higher systolic BP,
plasma triglycerides, and fasting glucose and with lower HDL
cholesterol. However, increasing the servings of beans was as-
sociated with a lower diastolic BP. Moreover, substituting one
serving of beans for white rice was associated with a 35% lower
risk of the metabolic syndrome in Costa Rican adults without type
2 diabetes.

The adverse relation of metabolic conditions with an increased
intake of white rice has been reported in other populations. In
a large cohort study of women living in the United States, mainly
whites, Sun et al (2) showed that a higher intake of white rice was
associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. The same
conclusion was recently made for Japanese (3) and Chinese (4)
women—2 ethnic groups with a high consumption of this car-
bohydrate; a similar ﬁnding was observed in Indians from
Chennai in a cross-sectional study (27). For whites and Chinese,
the increase in risk of diabetes occurred at 300 g/d (;2 servings/d),

whereas in Japanese women it occurred at 560 g/d. Here, we
reported signiﬁcant mean differences in some of the car-
diometabolic components at a lower intake: 1 serving/d (;150
g/d). Limiting white rice consumption to this smaller amount
may be associated with more preventive beneﬁts against meta-
bolic disease. To our knowledge, there are no reports on the role
of white rice intake on diabetes or its risk factors in other Latino
ethnic groups.

Studies showing a protective effect of beans, the Phaseolus
vulgaris species commonly consumed in Latin America, are
scarce. Most published reports focused on legumes as a group,
or speciﬁcally on soybeans, which have reported beneﬁts in
preventing and treating certain types of cancer, osteoporosis,
heart disease, and menopausal symptoms (28). However, soy-
beans have a nutrient composition different from that of beans:
a higher content of protein, fat, and calcium and a lower ﬁber
content and folate availability (28). Their high isoﬂavones
content, which is limited in beans, confers distinctive properties
that may explain the unique health beneﬁts of soybeans. Several
mechanisms for the protective effect of beans have been pro-
posed, including high ﬁber and a-linolenic contents but a low
saturated fat content (7, 8). We adjusted for dietary ﬁber in our
models. Because Costa Ricans commonly cook beans in oil or
add it later, we adjusted for the type of cooking oil. In the
current study, a higher frequency of bean intake was associated
with a higher use of palm oil, which is high in saturated fat. The
signiﬁcant trend for lower cardiometabolic risk factors with
increasing servings of beans remained after adjustment for these
potential covariates. Other studies have reported results similar
to ours (9–11). Of those studies reporting speciﬁc intakes, the
beneﬁt was observed at 0.33 (;86 g) to 0.5 (;150 g) cups/d (1–

1.5 servings/d), which agrees with our ﬁnding. We observed the
most beneﬁcial cardiometabolic proﬁle at .1 serving beans/d,
which suggests that recommendations for bean intake may be
increased to that amount.

The innovative aspect of our study was the analysis of the role
of different ratios of beans to white rice and the substitution of
beans for white rice. Sun et al (2) reported that replacing one
serving of white rice with brown rice reduced the risk of type 2
diabetes. Noel et al (29) showed that a traditional dietary pattern
of rice and beans in Puerto Ricans living in the United States was
associated with a lower HDL-cholesterol concentration and the
highest likelihood of the metabolic syndrome. The authors did
not conduct an analysis separately for the 2 foods, and they
suggest that the large contribution of white rice to total energy
consumption in this population was likely responsible for the
observed results. In an intervention study, Sakuma et al (30)
reported a dose-response effect of increasing the amount of barley
mixed with white rice on a decreasing postprandrial response of
plasma glucose and insulin concentrations. Yet, the speciﬁc
combination of white rice and beans had not been tested until this
study was conducted.

A limitation of this study was its cross-sectional nature, which
hindered the ability of establishing a causal direction between
intake and cardiometabolic proﬁle. Longitudinal studies may
clarify the observed associations. Additionally, we did not have
data on the type of white rice. The cultivar of the grain and
processing and cooking methods inﬂuence the glycemic index,
amylose and micronutrient contents, and antioxidant capacity of
each type of rice (5, 31–33). In turn, these nutritional variations
can induce metabolic responses differently. Costa Rica produces
;60% of the rice consumed by its population, with .1000

different producers across the country (34). Thus, details on rice
cultivar and processing may be difﬁcult to assess. Similarly, P.
vulgaris includes several varieties of beans. Although our study
did not differentiate between types of beans, the most common
varieties of beans have an energy content and nutrient compo-
sition similar to those of black beans—the type mostly con-
sumed in Costa Rica (9, 28). Thus, our
results may be
generalized to ethnic groups who consume other types of beans.
Future studies may explore any potential variation on car-
diometabolic risk factors by type of beans and white rice as well
as processing and cooking methods.

Our study had several strengths. First, we used an FFQ that has
been validated speciﬁcally for Costa Ricans, which likely cap-
tured an accurate intake of the exposure foods and other covariate
nutrients. More importantly, our study considered a culturally
appropriate food (beans) as a possible substitution for white rice
in the prevention of cardiometabolic risk factors in Costa Ricans.
White rice consumption is widespread in Costa Rica, especially
among low-income people. For a potential dietary intervention on
prevention of chronic disease to be successful, it is critical to

replace a staple food with another traditional, familiar, and in-
expensive food. A focus group study in Chinese adults reported
that the main barriers to acceptance of brown rice as a substitute
for white rice included texture, taste, and price (35); similar
reasons can be expected from other cultures. Brown rice, al-
though shown to lower type 2 diabetes risk in whites when
substituted for white rice, is not commonly available or consumed
in Latin America; thus, it might not be an appropriate substitution
for Costa Ricans. Beans may be a healthy, inexpensive, and
culturally appropriate option in reducing cardiovascular risk
factors.

Our study may help guide future dietary interventions to
prevent type 2 diabetes and other chronic conditions. Note that
the analytic models for possible substitutions or changes in the
ratios of beans to white rice included energy intake; thus, po-
tential dietary changes should maintain equivalent energy intakes
for each participant. Formative research may examine the fea-
sibility of making such dietary changes, particularly regarding
food preparation, taste, and cost. In addition, it may serve as
a model for similar substitution analysis studies of suitable foods

Disease Events: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of
Prospective Cohorts

Background-—Glycemic index (GI) and glycemic load (GL) have been associated with coronary heart disease (CHD) risk in some but
not all cohort studies. We therefore assessed the association of GI and GL with CHD risk in prospective cohorts.

Methods and Results-—We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL (through April 5, 2012) and identiﬁed all prospective
cohorts assessing associations of GI and GL with incidence of CHD. Meta-analysis of observational studies in epidemiology
(MOOSE) methodologies were used. Relative measures of risk, comparing the group with the highest exposure (mean GI of
cohorts=84.4 GI units, range 79.9 to 91; mean GL of cohorts=224.8, range 166 to 270) to the reference group (mean GI=72.3 GI
units, range 68.1 to 77; mean GL=135.4, range 83 to 176), were pooled using random-effects models, expressed as relative risk
(RR) with heterogeneity assessed by v2 and quantiﬁed by I2. Subgroups included sex and duration of follow-up. Ten studies
(n=240 936) were eligible. Pooled analyses showed an increase in CHD risk for the highest GI quantile compared with the lowest,
with RR=1.11 (95% conﬁdence interval [CI] 0.99 to 1.24) and for GL, RR=1.27 (95% CI 1.09 to 1.49), both with evidence of
heterogeneity (I2>42%, P<0.07). Subgroup analyses revealed only a signiﬁcant modiﬁcation by sex, with the female cohorts
showing signiﬁcance for GI RR=1.26 (95% CI 1.12 to 1.41) and for GL RR=1.55 (95% CI 1.18 to 2.03).

Conclusions-—High GI and GL diets were signiﬁcantly associated with CHD events in women but not in men. Further studies are
required to determine the relationship between GI and GL with CHD in men. ( J Am Heart Assoc. 2012;1:e000752 doi: 10.1161/

events in Western nations.1 The predominant concern in heart
disease prevention has been saturated fatty acid (SFA)
reduction,
leading to widespread therapeutic adoption of
low-total-fat, high-carbohydrate diets as the standard dietary
approach for the reduction of coronary heart disease (CHD)
risk.2,3 However, recent prospective cohort meta-analyses
suggest an even greater increase in CHD risk when highly
reﬁned and readily absorbed carbohydrates replaced SFAs.4,5
As a result, SFAs per se no longer appeared to be associated
with CHD, emphasizing the potentially deleterious effects
of reﬁned, rapidly absorbed carbohydrates.4,5 In addition,
replacement of SFAs with unsaturated fatty acids and complex
carbohydrates is associated with favorable changes in CHD
risk factors.6–8 These ﬁndings have intensiﬁed the focus on
carbohydrates, because diets rich in highly processed carbo-
hydrates can lead to raised triglycerides (TGs),9 reductions in
high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C),10 and increasing
CHD risk.11

Carbohydrates with differing physical form, particle size,
chemical structure, and ﬁber content alter the rate of starch
digestion and their physiological response. The glycemic
index (GI) was developed to characterize the rate of digestion

GI and GL With CHD: A Meta-Analysis of Cohorts

of a carbohydrate food compared with a reference carbohy-
drate food.12 Over the last 3 decades, clinical trials have
demonstrated that reducing the GI or glycemic load (GL), the
product of GI and the available carbohydrate content of a
food,13 in the context of diets low in saturated fat, can
improve CHD risk factors including body mass index (BMI),
blood pressure, and serum cholesterol.14–24 Similar favorable
effects have been seen with lower SFAs, higher poly-/
monounsaturated fatty acids, and higher complex carbohy-
drate diets.6–8 These randomized controlled trials provide
data that are harmonious with the emerging, albeit incon-
sistent, cohort literature on the unfavorable relationships
between higher GI and GL dietary patterns and CHD risk.
Cohort studies have also shown an association between low
GI diets25,26 and reduced development of hyperglycemia and
diabetes, further implicating the GI
in the progression to
CHD.25,26 This dietary pattern is also likely to have the
additional advantage of reduced LDL cholesterol by lower
intake of SFAs and dietary cholesterol.

Despite the proposed physiological mechanisms,27 pub-
lished cohort studies in the last decade have produced mixed
results for the associations of GI and GL with CHD.28–31 We
therefore undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis of
prospective cohort studies with healthy populations at
baseline to determine whether associations exist between
GI and GL with CHD.

Methods
Data Sources and Study Selection
We conducted separate searches for all prospective cohort
studies that assessed potential associations between glyce-
mic index or load and primary incidence of CHD (including
myocardial
infarction [MI] or death due to CHD) in adults.
We followed the meta-analysis of observational studies in
epidemiology (MOOSE) guidelines for this report.32 Electronic
databases (MEDLINE 1946-March, Week 4, 2012; EMBASE
1980–2012, Week 13; CINAHL 1982–December 2011) were
searched by 2 individuals independently; searches were
supplemented by manual searches through the reference lists
of original publications and review articles. The following
search terms were used: ([Glycemic or Glycaemic Index] or
[Glycemic or Glycaemic Load]) and (CHD or Cardiovascular
Disease or CVD or MI) and (Prospective or Cohort). Titles and
abstracts were initially reviewed to identify relevant reports by
2 independent
reviewers (A.M., L.C., both investigators);
reviewers conducted a subsequent full-text assessment of all
studies in which there was uncertainty about the assessment
of
regarding eligibility were
resolved through discussion with 2 additional adjudicators

relevance. Disagreements

Data Extraction
independently reviewed and
Two reviewers (A.M., L.C.)
extracted relevant data employing a standardized pro forma
sheet with the ﬁrst author and year of publication used as
study identiﬁers for convenience. Data extracted from each
cohort included information about sample size, population
characteristics (age and sex), country of origin,
follow-up
duration, method of collecting dietary information, outcome
measures, exposure quantiﬁcation, and analytical methods,
including adjustment parameters used for confounding fac-
tors. The most complete multivariate adjusted risk estimates
from eligible studies assessing GI and GL associations with
CHD events with their corresponding conﬁdence intervals
(CIs) were extracted to provide the main end points. All
authors of eligible reports were contacted to acquire any
missing data for each exposure level
including number of
events, person-years, mean or median dose of GI and GL (all
values were converted to bread scale [GI=100] if not already
reported as such,31,33–36 with bread scale=glucose scale/
0.7),37 as well as risk estimates with corresponding CIs.

Data Synthesis
Data were analyzed using Review Manager (RevMan) 5.1.4
(Cochrane Library software, Oxford, UK) and STATA version
11.0 (StataCorp, College Station, TX). The natural log-trans-
formed relative risks of CHD events (including MI) with
corresponding standard errors comparing the highest exposure
level with the reference group from each cohort, irrespective of
the number of quantile divisions in the original analysis, were
pooled in separate analyses for GI and GL. The generic inverse
variance method with random-effects models in RevMan were
used to allow for heterogeneity assessment. Interstudy heter-
ogeneity was tested by Cochrane’s Q (v2) and quantiﬁed by the
I2 statistic. Regardless of P value, sensitivity analyses were
performed to identify sources of heterogeneity.38 Potential
publication bias was assessed visually by inspecting funnel
plots of effect size against the standard error and formally
tested using Begg’s and Egger’s tests in STATA.39,40 Our a priori
stratiﬁed analyses included sex and duration of follow-up, that
is, whether studies were more or less than 10 years, consistent
with the 10-year Framingham Risk Score41 approach, and
analyzed using meta-regression in STATA. Statistical signiﬁ-
cance was deﬁned as P<0.05 for all comparisons, except for
Cochrane’s Q (v2), where signiﬁcance was set at <0.10.

12 GI reports28–31,33,35,36,42,43 and 12 GL reports28–31,33–
36,42,43 were selected for analyses. Two reports28,34 on the

subjects, respectively. During 6 to 25 years of follow-up,
6940 coronary events were recorded. All studies used Cox
proportional hazard models for CHD risk estimation analyses,
except for 1 study43 which used restricted cubic spline
models. The most common confounders adjusted for included
age, BMI, and cigarette smoking, with full multivariate
analyses outlined in Table 1. All cohorts excluded those with
documented CHD or major CHD risk factor at
time of
enrollment, with the exception of 1 that included a population
5% of whom had diabetes35 but adjusted for diabetes status.
All analyses were stratiﬁed by sex. The majority of the studies
(7 of 10) used either a semiquantitative or quantitative Food
Frequency Questionnaire (SFFQ or FFQ),28,30,31,33,34,36,42 but

Percent energy for each component in each quantile was calculated from reported intake in grams multiplied by energy per gram (4 kcal/g for protein and CH2O, and 9 kcal/g for fat) and
expressed as a percentage of the total energy in the respective quantile.

that were tested at an academic institution following the
International GI table methodologies. The majority of the
included reports provided dietary pattern data for GL
quantiles. The dietary patterns across the different quantiles
of GL were similar between studies, with a trend of increasing
carbohydrate and decreasing protein and fat content at
higher GL quantiles (Table 2).

Glycemic Index and Coronary Heart Disease
Figure 2 (overall analysis) shows the overall pooled relative
risk estimation of GI with CHD events. The CHD incidence

rate was increased at the highest level of GI exposure (mean
GI of 84.4 GI units, range 79.9 to 91) relative to the lowest
(mean GI of 72.3 GI units, range 68.1 to 77), RR=1.11, 95%
CI 0.99 to 1.24, and approached signiﬁcance (P=0.09) but
with signiﬁcant evidence of heterogeneity (I2=45%, P=0.05).
Sensitivity analyses identiﬁed the Grau et al43 report on men
as the largest contributor to heterogeneity. The removal of
this study changed the risk estimate for the association of
GI with CHD (RR=1.14 [95% CI 1.02 to 1.26], P=0.02) and
also improved the precision of the estimate and eliminated
much of the heterogeneity (I2=30%, P=0.16). A priori strat-
iﬁcation revealed no signiﬁcant modiﬁcation of association

based on generic inverse variance (IV) methods in random-effects models and represent the signiﬁcance for association of high-GI diets with CHD.
The P value in a rectangle depicts the signiﬁcance of differences between the subgroups. Interstudy heterogeneity was tested by Cochrane’s Q

as subsets (b=0.95 [95% CI 0.71 to 1.26]), both with
evidence of heterogeneity (I2>44% for both, ﬁgure not

association of GI with CHD (b=0.77 [95% CI 0.65 to 0.93];
P=0.004, Figure 2, sex-speciﬁc subgroups). The pooled
female cohorts28,31,33,36,42,43 showed a larger, statistically

Glycemic Load and Coronary Heart Disease
Figure 3 (overall analysis) shows the overall pooled relative
risk estimation of GL with CHD events. The pooled risk
estimation showed a signiﬁcant
increase in CHD risk
(RR=1.27 [95% CI 1.09 to 1.49], P=0.002), with signiﬁcant
heterogeneity (I2=43%, P=0.06), for the highest level of GL

exposure (mean GL of 224.8 GL units, range 166 to 270)
relative to the lowest (mean GL of 135.4 GL units, range 83 to
176). Sensitivity analyses identiﬁed the Grau et al43 and Sieri
et al33 reports on women as the largest contributors to
heterogeneity when removed individually. The removal of Grau
et al43 somewhat reduced the estimate of the association of
GL with CHD (RR=1.21 [95% CI 1.05 to 1.38], P=0.007;
I2=23%, P=0.23), as did the removal of Sieri et al33 (RR=1.22
[95% CI 1.06 to 1.40], P=0.005; I2=27%, P=0.19). Similar to
the GI analyses, no modiﬁcation in the association
follow-up analysis, ≥10
was revealed by the duration of
years29,34–36,43 (RR=1.26 [95% CI 1.01 to 1.59]) versus <10
years30,31,33,42 (RR=1.29 [95% CI 1.02 to 1.63]) with b=0.99
(95% CI 0.68 to 1.44), with evidence of heterogeneity (I2>47%,
ﬁgure not shown) for both subgroups. Congruent with the GI
analysis, sex was a signiﬁcant modiﬁer of the association of
GL with CHD (b=0.73 [95% CI 0.56 to 0.96]; P=0.02, Figure 3,
sex-speciﬁc subgroups). The female cohorts31,33,34,36,42,43
showed a larger, statistically signiﬁcant association (DGL
between mean of highest exposure and mean of
refer-
ence=88.4±17.6 SE, RR=1.55 [95% CI 1.18 to 2.03]), whereas
in the male cohorts,29,30,33,35,36,43 the association was not
signiﬁcant (DGL between mean of highest exposure and mean
of reference=90.4±9.2 SE, RR=1.08 [95% CI 0.93 to 1.26]).

Figure 3. Pooled risk estimate of all prospective cohorts investigating the association of highest GL exposure with CHD events (including death

ﬁgure is stratiﬁed by sex-speciﬁc subgroups with subtotal boxes in 3.1.1 and 3.1.2 summarizing the pooled analysis for women31,33,34,36,42,43 and
for men,29,30,33,35,43 respectively. The total analysis box represents the overall pooled analysis for both men and women. P values in circles are
based on generic inverse variance (IV) methods in random-effects models and represent the signiﬁcance for association of high-GL diets with

Q (v2) at a signiﬁcance level of P<0.10 and quantiﬁed by I2.38 CHD indicates coronary heart disease; GI, glycemic index.

There was signiﬁcant evidence of heterogeneity in the female
subset but not in the male subset.

Publication Bias
Funnel plots for each of the overall analyses were inspected
for presence of publication bias (Figures 4 and 5). Neither
Begg’s nor Egger’s tests revealed signiﬁcant evidence of
publication bias in the overall analyses of GI and GL (P>0.115
for all). However, in the visual inspection of the GI funnel plot,
the Grau et al43 report on men appears to be an outlier and in
the GL funnel plot, and the Grau et al43 report on women
appears to be an outlier (outside the pseudo 95% conﬁdence
limits).

Discussion
We believe that this analysis represents the most compre-
hensive meta-analysis of the data presented as quantiles of GI
and/or GL. However, we were unable to include 2 studies in
this analysis because of the expression of results as either the
substitution of low GI carbohydrates for SFAs, rather than
dietary GI analysis, or the incremental association of dietary
GI with CHD rather than quantile presentation (ie, CHD risk

per 5 GI unit increments). These studies indicated that in
Danish47 and Black American44 men, positive beneﬁts for
cardiovascular events were seen related to consumption of
lower GI foods. We demonstrated an overall increased relative
risk of CHD of 11% in the comparison of the highest versus
lowest quantile of GI and a 27% increased relative risk of CHD
for the highest versus the lowest quantile of GL. The effect
was seen only in women with 26% increased relative risk of
CHD for GI and 55% for GL.

The sex difference in the CHD response to the glycemic
index was unexpected and may be the result of the larger total
number of subjects in the female cohorts (n=177 887, CHD
events=4260) than in the male cohorts (n=63 049, CHD
events=2680) and our inability to include 2 studies, 1 from
Denmark47 and 1 from the United States,44 both of which
demonstrated adverse effects of high GI foods or diets on
CHD outcomes in men. Furthermore, the 1 study43 of men in
the present analysis that showed a near-signiﬁcant deleteri-
ous effect of
low-GI diets was also responsible for the
heterogeneity in the analysis. This study differed from the
other studies of men in several respects. The proportion (54%)
of smokers was almost twice that of the other studies, and
BMI was somewhat lower (25.3 versus 26.1 kg/m2); men with
lower BMIs have been shown to be less susceptible to the

effects of GI on CHD risk.48 There may also be another
potential explanation for the difference between men and
women, possibly a result of differences in diet reporting. For
example, if women report more precisely, there would be less
measurement error and hence better power. In addition, there
may be more homogeneity (insufﬁcient heterogeneity) in the
diets of men and therefore a lack of the necessary power to
detect potentially important relationships between dietary
GI/GL and CHD risk in men.

Despite these reservations there are reasons why women
may be potentially more vulnerable to high glycemic index
diets. Part of the protection that women have from CHD may
be related to their high HDL-C levels.49,50 Higher glycemic
index diets tend to reduce circulating HDL-C concentrations
and thus disproportionately increase CHD risk in women,
especially when postmenopausal.51 At the same time, high-GI
diets may raise TG levels,52 which may also carry more risk for
CHD in women than in men.53,54

Other

factors that

in general may contribute to the
increased CHD risk with high-GI diets are blood pressure
and CRP, both of which may be raised by high-GI diets.52,55
Conversely, acarbose, the a-glucosidase inhibitor that con-
verts dietary carbohydrate to a low glycemic index form, has
been shown to prevent hypertension and CHD events in the
STOP NIDDM trial.56

The link between low GI and GL diets and lower CHD risk is
also substantiated by randomized clinical
trials (RCTs)
assessing the effects of dietary strategies low in GI and GL
with low saturated fat content. A systematic review of such
RCTs in overweight and obese subjects found that replacing
reﬁned carbohydrates with low-GI complex carbohydrates

conferred more beneﬁcial effects on CHD lipid risk factors
when compared with complex starchy carbohydrates with
higher GI.57 There has also been emerging evidence on the
positive effects of low-GI diets on CHD risk factors such as
oxidative damage58 and inﬂammation22 in overweight/obese
and type 2 diabetic individuals, respectively. In addition, meta-
analyses of low-GI RCTs have shown beneﬁcial effects on
body weight and lipid proﬁles in obese and overweight
subjects21 as well as on glycemic control in type 2 diabetic
subjects.59

The current studies do not suggest a latency effect of GI or
GL on CHD risk. Because no studies have a time frame shorter
than 6 years, it is not possible to determine whether the effect
is early, possibly from alterations in clotting factors,60 or later
due to reduction in the rate of atheroma formation secondary
to oxidative damage.61

An earlier meta-analysis that assessed the effect of dietary
GI on several health outcomes including diabetes, CHD, and
cancer also concluded that low-GI diets were protective for
diabetes, CHD, and colon and breast cancers.62 However, only
2 studies28,29 were available to assess CHD outcome at the
time of that analysis.

In general, the glycemic index and glycemic load data were
in agreement, although the magnitude of the CHD risk was
greater based on the difference between the extreme
quantiles of glycemic load. In the overall GL extreme quantile
analysis there was signiﬁcant heterogeneity that became
nonsigniﬁcant when either the Grau et al43 or the Sieri et al33
reports on women were removed. The Grau et al43 report was
visually an outlier on the publication bias funnel plot, which
could potentially be a result of the difference in the analytical

approach, using restricted cubic splines in Grau et al,43
compared with the methods of analyses used in other reports.
We could not ﬁnd an explanation for the heterogeneity in the
overall GL analysis due to the Sieri et al33 report on women.
The weaknesses of the present study include the limited
number of studies, the inability to include potentially relevant
studies44,47 because of
lack of necessary data, and the
heterogeneity in the overall analyses, especially in the likely
underpowered analyses of men. Another inherent limitation of
observational analyses is the potential problem for residual
confounding as well as the possibility of overadjusting, which
remains an area of debate in epidemiology.63 Perhaps, the
most common limitation in meta-analyses of dietary studies is
the combination of dietary data collected using multiple
instruments. Although no change was found in our overall
conclusions with post hoc sensitivity analyses removing
the 429,35,43 reports with food diaries and interviews, because
of the time frame of published reports, the GI and GL data
were still compiled from various data sources. As such, our
ﬁndings should be considered with caution, and further
studies should be undertaken to allow sufﬁcient power for
subgroup analyses of dietary data sources.

limiting the racial diversity of

Although the reports included men and women from
Holland,29,31,36 Finland,35 Denmark,43 Sweden,30,42 Italy,33
and the United States,28,34 the majority of the population was
white,
this meta-analysis.
However, it is noteworthy that our systematic review captured
a report on African American men that, although not included
because of lack of necessary data (ie, quantile analyses),
showed that a 5-unit increase in GI conferred a 16% increase
in CHD risk.44 Further studies are required with a wider range
of ethnic groups and more racial diversity both in women and
especially in men because cohorts of men were likely
underpowered.

The strength of our study included the use of random-
effects models to allow assessment of heterogeneity to guide
the sensitivity analyses. We further believe that our system-
atic review was strengthened by our efforts to acquire as
much data as possible by contacting all study authors to
include all relevant studies in our analyses.

Conclusion
We conclude that a reduction in the glycemic index and
glycemic load may favorably affect CHD outcomes in women.
Further studies are required to determine the effect of the
glycemic index and load on CHD risk in men.

Effects of Low-Carbohydrate vs Low-Fat Diets
on Weight Loss and Cardiovascular Risk Factors

A Meta-analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials

Background: Low-carbohydrate diets have become in-
creasingly popular for weight loss. However, evidence
from individual trials about benefits and risks of these
diets to achieve weight loss and modify cardiovascular
risk factors is preliminary.

Methods: We used the Cochrane Collaboration search
strategy to identify trials comparing the effects of low-
carbohydrate diets without restriction of energy intake
vs low-fat diets in individuals with a body mass index
(calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square
of height in meters) of at least 25. Included trials had to
report changes in body weight in intention-to-treat analy-
sis and to have a follow-up of at least 6 months. Two re-
viewers independently assessed trial eligibility and qual-
ity of randomized controlled trials.

Results: Five trials including a total of 447 individuals ful-
filled our inclusion criteria. After 6 months, individuals as-
signed to low-carbohydrate diets had lost more weight than
individuals randomized to low-fat diets (weighted mean
difference, –3.3 kg; 95% confidence interval [CI], −5.3 to
−1.4 kg). This difference was no longer obvious after 12
months (weighted mean difference, −1.0 kg; 95% CI, −3.5
to 1.5 kg). There were no differences in blood pressure. Tri-

glyceride and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol values
changed more favorably in individuals assigned to low-
carbohydrate diets (after 6 months, for triglycerides,
weighted mean difference, −22.1 mg/dL [−0.25 mmol/L];
95% CI, −38.1 to −5.3 mg/dL [−0.43 to −0.06 mmol/L]; and
for high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, weighted mean dif-
ference, 4.6 mg/dL [0.12 mmol/L]; 95% CI, 1.5-8.1 mg/dL
[0.04-0.21 mmol/L]), but total cholesterol and low-
density lipoprotein cholesterol values changed more fa-
vorably in individuals assigned to low-fat diets (weighted
mean difference in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol af-
ter 6 months, 5.4 mg/dL [0.14 mmol/L]; 95% CI, 1.2-10.1
mg/dL [0.03-0.26 mmol/L]).

Conclusions: Low-carbohydrate, non–energy-restricted
diets appear to be at least as effective as low-fat, energy-
restricted diets in inducing weight loss for up to 1 year. How-
ever, potential favorable changes in triglyceride and high-
density lipoprotein cholesterol values should be weighed
against potential unfavorable changes in low-density lipo-
protein cholesterol values when low-carbohydrate diets to
induce weight loss are considered.

I N THE PAST 4 DECADES, THE PREVA-

lence of obesity among adults aged
20 to 74 years in the United States
increasedfrom13%to31%.1Inthe
United States, obesity results in an
estimated 325 000 deaths annually2 and ac-
counts for about 5.5% of total direct health
care costs.3,4 At any given time, approxi-
mately 45% of women and 30% of men in
the United States are attempting to lose
weight.5 Numerous diets have been pro-
posed to promote weight loss.6 Weight loss
from certain diets may lead to prevention
of type 2 diabetes and improved control of
hypertension7 and may reduce cardiovas-
cular morbidity and mortality. In a recent
meta-analysis of randomized controlled
trials, little evidence was found to support
the use of diets other than low-fat diets for
weight reduction.7 However, there is a lack

of data from well-controlled trials about the
most effective dietary approaches to achieve
meaningful and long-term weight loss in
overweight individuals. Although fat- and
energy-restricted diets are generally recom-
mended for these individuals,8,9
low-
carbohydrate, high-protein diets are one of
the most popular alternative weight loss ap-
proaches.10 Low-carbohydrate diets derive
alargeproportionofenergyintakefrompro-
tein and fat, and there is concern for the po-
tentially detrimental impact of these diets
on blood lipid levels and on cardiovascu-
lar risk.11 Results from individual clinical
trials and uncontrolled studies suggest that
there is insufficient evidence to make rec-
ommendations for or against the use of low-
carbohydrate diets.12

In this meta-analysis, we compare the ef-
fects of low-carbohydrate diets without en-

METHODS

LITERATURE SEARCH

We used the Cochrane Collaboration
search strategy13 and, together with a
professional librarian, searched
M E D L I N E , E M B A S E , P A S C A L ,
GLOBAL HEALTH, HEALTH, Web of
Science, and the Cochrane Library from
January 1, 1980, to February 28, 2005,
to identify all randomized controlled
trials that compared low-carbohydrate
with low-fat diets. We additionally re-
viewed UptoDate version 2005 and
Clinical Evidence Concise 2004 (issue
12), contacted experts in the field, and
searched reference lists of identified pub-
lications for citations of additional rel-
evant articles. We contacted original trial
investigators for additional informa-
tion where needed.

TRIAL SELECTION

AND DATA ABSTRACTION

To be included in this meta-analysis,
trials were required to use a random-
ized controlled design comparing the ef-
fects of a low-carbohydrate diet (de-
fined as a diet allowing a maximum
intake of 60 g of carbohydrates per day)
without energy intake restriction vs a

low-fat diet (defined as a diet allowing
a maximum of 30% of the daily energy
intake from fat) with energy intake re-
striction in individuals with a body mass
index (calculated as weight in kilo-
grams divided by the square of height
in meters) of at least 25. Included trials
had to report changes in body weight by
using an intention-to-treat analysis, to
have a follow-up of at least 6 months,
and to include individuals 16 years and
older. We excluded trials with cross-
over or sequential designs.

Two investigators (A.J.N. and A.N.) in-
dependently assessed trial eligibility and
quality. Disagreement was resolved by
consensus. Data from eligible trials were
extracted in duplicate. We assessed the
quality of included trials with respect to
concealed treatment allocation, blinded
outcome assessment, loss to follow-up,
and full description of losses to fol-
low-up and withdrawals.14 The nature of
the trials comparing diets required an
open intervention with no blinding of trial
participants and investigators.

The main end point was the weighted
mean difference in weight loss from base-
line to 6 and 12 months of follow-up be-
tween the 2 groups. Secondary end points
were the attrition rates on diets and the
weighted mean differences in percent-
age change of body weight, systolic and
diastolic blood pressure, blood lipid lev-
els (total cholesterol, high-density lipo-
protein cholesterol [HDL-C], low-
density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C],
and triglycerides), fasting glucose level,
fasting insulin level, and quality of life.

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS

We pooled treatment effects across trials
and calculated weighted mean differ-
ences for outcome measures in the low-
carbohydrate and the low-fat diet groups
by means of a random effects model.15 We
investigated the presence of publication
bias by means of funnel plots.16 We tested
for heterogeneity with the Cochran Q test
and measured inconsistency (I2; the per-
centage of total variance across studies that
is due to heterogeneity rather than chance)
of treatment effects across trials.17 Sensi-
tivity analyses were conducted to ex-
plore heterogeneity. We planned to con-
duct sensitivity analyses comparing trials
with blinded vs unblinded outcome as-
sessment, and trials with low-fat vs very-
low-fat diets as a comparison with the low-
carbohydrate diets. All statistical analyses
were performed with Stata 8.2 software
(Stata Corp, College Station, Tex).

RESULTS

Six published articles fulfilled our in-
clusion criteria (Figure 1).18-23 Five
of them described trials that in-
cluded a total of 447 individuals (222
on low-carbohydrate diets and 225
on low-fat diets) and reported
6-month follow-up data. The sixth
article21 reported on an extended 12-
month follow-up from 1 of the other
5 articles.20 Twelve-month fol-
low-up data were available from only
3 trials,19,21,23 including 137 indi-
viduals on low-carbohydrate diets
and 138 individuals on low-fat di-
ets. Table 1 shows the character-
istics of the 5 trials; Table 2 sum-
marizes the patient data.

Four of the included trials
compared the effects of low-
carbohydrate diets vs energy-
restricted low-fat diets allowing
for up to 30% of daily energy
intake from fat. One trial com-
pared a low-carbohydrate diet
with a very-low-fat diet containing
only 10% of energy from fat.23
T h e r e w a s n o t r i a l w i t h a
f o l l o w - u p o f m o r e t h a n 1 2
months. The small number of
trials with small numbers of indi-
viduals precluded a sensitive
exploration of publication bias,
although the funnel plot did not
indicate evidence of such a bias.

All subjects in the trials were
free-living individuals who bought
and/or prepared their own food.

*Method used for primary analysis.

Mean ages of included individuals
ranged from 42 to 49 years. Most
trials included predominantly
women and healthy individuals.
Only 1 trial20 included extremely
obese individuals, with a mean body
mass index of 43 and a prevalence
of diabetes of 39% (Table 2). One
trial22 reported intention-to-treat data
using a linear mixed-effects model,

and another trial23 used the baseline-
value-carried-forward method to
account for missing data. The 3 re-
maining trials18-20 presented inten-
tion-to-treat analyses using both the
last-value and the baseline-carried-
forward methods. In this meta-
analysis, we report results using these
individual trials’ data based on the
last-value-carried-forward method.

There was no qualitative change in
outcome when data from these trials
were reanalyzed by the baseline-
value-carried-forward method.
Changes in body weight are shown
in Table 3, blood pressure in
Table 4, and lipid values in
Tables 5, 6, 7, and 8 in indi-
vidual trials comparing low-
carbohydrate with low-fat diets.

QUALITY OF TRIALS

All trials used concealed treatment al-
location. Because of the nature of the
trials, blinding of participants was im-
possible.Noneofthetrialsusedblinded
outcome assessment for the primary
outcome of change in body weight.
Only 1 trial22 fully described the rea-
sons for losses to follow-up (Table 1).

WEIGHT LOSS

After 6 months, individuals assigned
to low-carbohydrate diets had lost
more weight than individuals ran-
domized to low-fat diets (weighted
mean difference, −3.3 kg; 95% con-
fidence interval [CI], −5.3 to −1.4 kg;
P=.02 for the test of heterogeneity;
I2=65%; 95% uncertainty interval
[UI], 7%-87%) (Figure 2). Hetero-
geneitywasmainlyduetothefactthat
the only trial assigning subjects in the
low-fatarmtotheOrnishdietallowed

a maximum of 10% of the daily en-
ergy intake from fat,23 whereas all
other trials allowed 30% of the daily
energy intake from fat in subjects
randomized to low-fat diets. When
this trial was excluded in a sensitiv-
ity analysis, the weighted mean dif-
ference for subjects randomized to
low-carbohydrate vs low-fat diets
was −4.3 kg (95% CI, −5.6 to −3.0;
P=.77 for the test of heterogeneity;
I2=0%; 95% UI, 0%-85%). After 12
months there was no significant dif-
ference in weight loss between in-
dividuals in the 3 trials19,21,23 ran-
domized to low-carbohydrate and
low-fat diets (weighted mean differ-
ence, −1.0 kg; 95% CI, −3.5 to 1.5;
P=.15 for the test of heterogeneity;
I2=48%; 95% UI, 0%-85%).

The summary estimates of
weighted mean differences in per-
centage change in body weight in in-
dividuals randomized to low-car-

bohydrate vs low-fat diets were as
follows: after 6 months, −3.4%; 95%
CI, −6.0% to −0.7%; P⬍.001 for the
test of heterogeneity; I2=91%; 95% UI,
83%-96%; and after 12 months (3
trials), −0.9%; 95% CI, −3.1 to 1.3;
P=.15 for the test of heterogeneity;
I2=47%; 95% UI, 0%-84%.

COMPLETION RATES

ON DIETS

After 6 months, individuals random-
ized to low-carbohydrate diets were
more likely to complete the trial than
were individuals randomized to low-
fat diets (156 [70%] of 222 individu-
als randomized to low-carbohydrate
diets vs 129 [57%] of 225 individu-
als randomized to low-fat diets; odds
ratio, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.2-2.6). After 12
months, this difference was no longer
significant (84 [62%] of 135 individu-
als vs 72 [54%] of 134 individuals;
odds ratio, 1.4; 95% CI, 0.9-2.3).

BLOOD PRESSURE

There was a trend toward lower sys-
tolic and diastolic blood pressure in
individuals randomized to low-
carbohydrate diets after 6 months
(weighted mean difference in systolic
blood pressure, −2.4 mm Hg; 95% CI,
−4.9 to 0.1 mm Hg; P=.76 for the test
of heterogeneity; I2=0%; 95% UI, 0%-
79%;weightedmeandifferenceindia-
stolic blood pressure, −1.8 mm Hg;
95% CI, −3.7 to 0.1 mm Hg; P=.30
for the test of heterogeneity; I2=17%;
95% UI, 0%-83%). However, this
trend was no longer detectable after
12 months (Figure 3).

LIPID VALUES

Intention-to-treat data for lipid
values were available from 4 of 5
trials.19,20,22,23 Summary estimates of
weighted mean differences at 6
months were not in favor of low-
carbohydrate diets for total choles-
terol values (8.9 mg/dL [0.23
mmol/L]; 95% CI, 3.1-14.3 mg/dL
[0.08-0.37 mmol/L]; P=.48 for the
test of heterogeneity; I2=0%; 95% UI,
0%-85%) (Figure 4), nor for LDL-C
values (5.4 mg/dL [0.14 mmol/L];
95% CI, 1.2-10.1 mg/dL [0.03-0.26
mmol/L]; P=.66 for the test of het-
erogeneity; I2= 0%; 95% UI, 0%-
85%) (Figure 5). At 12 months, the
summary estimates of the weighted
mean change for total cholesterol level
(10.1 mg/dL [0.26 mmol/L]; 95% CI,
3.5-16.2 mg/dL [0.09-0.42 mmol/l];
P=.63 for the test of heterogeneity;
I2=0%; 95% UI, 0%-90%) and LDL-C
level (7.7 mg/dL [0.20 mmol/L]; 95%
CI, 1.9-13.9 mg/dL [0.05-0.36
mmol/L]; P=.80 for the test of het-
erogeneity; I2= 0%; 95% UI, 0%-
90%) were basically unchanged when
compared with the 6-month data.

Contrarily, summary estimates of
weighted mean differences after 6
months in HDL-C (Figure 6) and
triglyceride (Figure 7) values were
in favor of low-carbohydrate diets (for
HDL-C, 4.6 mg/dL [0.12 mmol/L];
95% CI, 1.5-8.1 mg/dL [0.04-0.21

Intention-to-treat data for changes
in glucose and insulin values were
available from 3 trials, but meth-

of glucose and insulin values pre-
cluded a pooled analysis of these
measures. In one trial there was no
difference between the 2 groups,
either in the area under the glucose
curve or in the area under the insu-
lin curve after a glucose tolerance
test.19 Similarly, in the one trial com-

very-low-fat diet, there was no dif-
ference in fasting glucose or insu-
lin values between the 2 groups.23 In
the last trial,20 fasting glucose val-
ues were lowered more efficiently in
individuals on the low-carbohy-
drate diet than on the low-fat diet af-
ter 6 months (−10.8 ± 23.4 mg/dL
[−0.6 ± 1.3 mmol/L] vs −1.8 ± 21.6
mg/dL [–0.1±1.2 mmol/L]; P=.02),
but this effect was no longer detect-
able after 12 months. In the same
trial, there was no difference in in-
sulin levels between the 2 groups af-
ter 12 months. In the subgroup of
patients with diabetes in this trial,
hemoglobin A1c values changed more
favorably in individuals on the low-
carbohydrate diet than on the low-
fat diet at 12 months (−0.7%±1.0%
vs −0.1%±1.6%; P=.02; after adjust-
ment for weight loss).

COMMENT

In this meta-analysis of random-
ized controlled trials comparing the
effects of low-carbohydrate vs low-
fat diets, low-carbohydrate diets
were more effective in inducing
weight loss after 6 months, but this
effect was no longer obvious after 12
months of follow-up. There was no
clear benefit of either diet when their
effects on cardiovascular risk fac-
tors were examined. Changes in
blood pressure were not different be-
tween the 2 groups. Whereas total
and LDL-C levels decreased more in
individuals randomized to low-fat di-
ets, HDL-C and triglyceride values
changed more favorably in individu-
als randomized to low-carbohy-
drate diets.

This study has several strengths
and limitations. We conducted an

though formal testing did not indi-

cannot definitely be ruled out be-
cause of the small number of the

any test to detect publication bias.
The quality of the included
trials was moderate. Whereas most
trials used concealed treatment
allocation, losses to follow-up were

quite substantial. No trial reported

Therefore, we were not able to

originally planned. The absence of
blinded outcome assessment is a
flaw that potentially limits the
validity of individual trials.

Dropout rates were substantial.
After 1 year of follow-up, between
31% and 48% of individuals ran-
domized to low-carbohydrate di-
ets, and between 37% and 50% of in-
dividuals randomized to low-fat
diets, had dropped out of the trials.
To account for missing data, origi-
nal trials conducted intention-to-
treat analyses, most of them using
either the baseline or the last-value-
carried-forward method. Both meth-
ods are problematic, as one cannot
necessarily assume that individuals
dropping out of a dietary interven-
tion trial will return to their base-
line body weight or maintain their
body weight achieved at the time of
dropout. However, the results based
on various methods of analysis were
consistent and thus may strengthen
the credibility of our findings. Fu-
ture trials, however, should aim at
obtaining a complete evaluation of
body weight and cardiovascular risk
factors in all participating individu-
als irrespective of complete or in-
complete adherence to allocated
diet.24

There was evidence of heteroge-
neity concerning the main out-
come of weight loss after 6 months.
The small number of trials in-
cluded in this meta-analysis and the
absence of trials using blinded out-
come assessment precluded formal
exploration of heterogeneity. None-
theless, heterogeneity was likely to
be due to the one trial that com-
pared a low-carbohydrate diet with
a very-low-fat diet, as opposed to a
low-fat diet as in other trials.23 Re-
sults were not qualitatively differ-
ent when the analysis was repeated
after exclusion of that trial.

Follow-up in the trials was too
short to look at cardiovascular mor-
bidity or mortality. Hence, out-
comes were limited to surrogate
markers such as body weight and
cardiovascular risk factors. Even for
the surrogate markers chosen, fol-
low-up durations were rather short.
Most trials included younger indi-
viduals with severe overweight and
obesity. Therefore, our results can-
not be generalized to more senior in-
dividuals or to individuals with mod-
erate overweight. In addition, no trial
reported assessment of quality of life
for individuals on either diet.
Clearly, there is a need for longer-

term trials in individuals with wider
ranges of age and overweight and ad-
dressing not only weight loss and
cardiovascular risk factors but also
cardiovascular morbidity, mortal-
ity, and quality of life.

A recent systematic review12 look-
ing at the efficacy and safety of low-
carbohydrate diets concluded that, at
that time, there was insufficient evi-
dence to make recommendations for
oragainsttheuseoflow-carbohydrate
diets. That review included highly
heterogeneous trials with respect to
designandcarbohydratecontent.The
review did not include any random-
ized controlled trial comparing the
effects of a low-carbohydrate diet
without energy restriction vs a low-
fat diet during a minimum of 6
months. On the basis of our results
from a meta-analysis of 6 randomized
controlledtrialspublishedsubsequent
to the systematic review, we believe
there is still insufficient evidence to

the use of low-carbohydrate diets to
induce weight loss, especially for du-
rationslongerthan6months.Thedif-
ferences in weight loss between low-
carbohydrate and low-fat diets after
12 months were minor and not clini-
cally relevant. In our opinion, the un-

caution against the conclusion that
low-carbohydrate diets can be gen-
erally recommended to promote
weight loss. No trials of low-carbo-
hydrate diets have been performed
that are powered for clinical end
points (eg, myocardial infarction or
death). It is therefore uncertain
whether the beneficial effects of these
diets on HDL-C and triglyceride lev-
els outweigh the unfavorable changes
in LDL-C level. In contrast, trials of
reduced-fatdiets,inconjunctionwith
other lifestyle modifications such as
increasedphysicalactivity,havedem-
onstrated long-term maintenance of
weight reduction and delayed onset
ofdiabetes.25,26Furthermore,random-
ized controlled trials have also dem-
onstrated the benefits of the Mediter-
ranean diet on secondary prevention
of cardiovascular disease.6

We conclude that low-carbohy-
drate diets appear to be at least as ef-
fective as low-fat diets in inducing
weight loss for a duration of up to 1
year. Low-carbohydrate diets are as-
sociated with unfavorable changes
in total cholesterol and LDL-C lev-
els, but favorable changes in triglyc-
eride and probably HDL-C values.
In the absence of evidence that low-
carbohydrate diets reduce cardio-
vascular morbidity and mortality,
such diets currently cannot be rec-
ommended for prevention of car-
diovascular disease.

in other community-based studies in China.2

Having grown up and lived for 21 years in Yingshang
County, where the study villages are situated, and continu-
ing to work in rural health research for many years in
China (R.C. and X.Q.), we do not think that the “power” of
the village leaders and the shadow of the Cultural Revolu-
tion would still influence our rural elderly health investi-
gation in terms of reporting bias. The Cultural Revolution
has passed and the economic reforms started more than a
quarter of a century ago.3 Village leaders, now selected by
rural citizens themselves, need to show acceptable behav-
ior to achieve their position. Because the community we
studied is much deprived and is lacking in health care and
medication, the participants warmly welcomed our health
survey and developed a close collaboration with the medi-
cally based interview team. They were eager to tell the in-
terviewers their symptoms in the clinical interviews (the
Chinese version of the Geriatric Mental State examination
has been used in other Chinese older populations4). The
validated depression diagnosis by the local Chinese psy-
chiatrists, the κ value of which is similar to that in other

studies,5 has supported our estimation of a low prevalence
of depression in older people in rural China.

ABSTRACT
Objective To assess the relation between the level of
habitual salt intake and stroke or total cardiovascular
disease outcome.
Design Systematic review and meta-analysis of
prospective studies published 1966-2008.
Data sources Medline (1966-2008), Embase (from 1988),
AMED (from 1985), CINAHL (from 1982), Psychinfo (from
1985), and the Cochrane Library.
Review methods For each study, relative risks and 95%
confidence intervals were extracted and pooled with a
random effect model, weighting for the inverse of the
variance. Heterogeneity, publication bias, subgroup, and
meta-regression analyses were performed. Criteria for
inclusion were prospective adult population study,
assessment of salt intake as baseline exposure,
assessment of either stroke or total cardiovascular
disease as outcome, follow-up of at least three years,
indication of number of participants exposed and number
of events across different salt intake categories.
Results There were 19 independent cohort samples from
13 studies, with 177 025 participants (follow-up 3.
5-19 years) and over 11 000 vascular events. Higher salt
intake was associated with greater risk of stroke (pooled
relative risk 1.23, 95% confidence interval 1.06 to 1.43;
P=0.007) and cardiovascular disease (1.14, 0.99 to 1.32;
P=0.07), with no significant evidence of publication bias.
For cardiovascular disease, sensitivity analysis showed
that the exclusion of a single study led to a pooled
estimate of 1.17 (1.02 to 1.34; P=0.02). The associations
observed were greater the larger the difference in sodium
intake and the longer the follow-up.
Conclusions High salt intake is associated with
significantly increased risk of stroke and total
cardiovascular disease. Because of imprecision in
measurement of salt intake, these effect sizes are likely to
be underestimated. These results support the role of a
substantial population reduction in salt intake for the
prevention of cardiovascular disease.

INTRODUCTION
During the past century, the evidence for the risks
imposed on human health by excess salt consumption
has become compelling. The causal relation between

habitual dietary salt intake and blood pressure has
been established through experimental, epidemiologi-
cal, migration, and intervention studies. Most adult
populations around the world have average daily salt
intakes higher than 6 g, and for many in eastern Europe
and Asia higher than 12 g. International recommenda-
tions suggest that average population salt intake should
be less than 5-6 g per day. Population based inter-
vention studies and randomised controlled clinical
trials have shown that it is possible to achieve signifi-
cant reductions in blood pressure with reduced salt
intake in people with and without hypertension.1
Based on the effects of high salt intake on blood pres-
sure and on the prominent role of high blood pressure
in promoting cardiovascular diseases, it has been sug-
gested that a population-wide reduction in salt intake
could substantially reduce the incidence of cardio-
vascular disease.2 On the basis of the results of a
meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials of salt
reduction,3 it was estimated that a reduction in habitual
dietary salt intake of 6 g a day would be associated with
reductions in systolic/diastolic blood pressure of
7/4 mm Hg in people with hypertension and 4/2 mm
Hg in those without hypertension. At the population
level these reductions in blood pressure could predict
an average lower rate of 24% for stroke and 18% for
coronary heart disease.4 Validation of these predic-
tions by a randomised controlled trial of the effects of
long term reduction in dietary salt on morbidity and
mortality from cardiovascular disease would provide
definite proof. At present, a study of this kind is not
available and, in fact, it is extremely unlikely that it
will ever be performed because of practical difficulties,
the long duration required, and high costs. Neverthe-
less, prospective cohort studies performed in the past
three decades that measured the levels of dietary salt
intake at baseline and recorded the incidence of vascu-
lar events have provided important indirect evidence.
Most of these studies found evidence of such relation,
although few had enough power to attain statistical sig-
nificance.

We performed a systematic review and meta-analy-
sis of the prospective studies of habitual dietary salt
intake and incidence of stroke and total cardiovascular

disease using strictly predetermined criteria for inclu-
sion or exclusion. We assessed whether or not the over-
all evidence in prospective studies supports the
presence of a relation between levels of dietary salt
intake and both stroke and cardiovascular outcomes
and calculated an estimate of the risk.

METHODS
Data sources and searches
We performed a systematic search for publications
using Medline (1966-2008), Embase (from 1988),
AMED (from 1985), CINAHL (from 1982), Psychinfo
(from 1985), and the Cochrane Library. Search strate-
gies used subject headings and key words with no lan-
guage restrictions. Further information was retrieved
through a manual search of references from recent
reviews and relevant published original studies. We
examined reference lists of the relevant reviews, iden-
tified studies, and reviewed the cited literature.5

Study selection
Two reviewers (LD and N-BK) independently extra-
cted the data. Discrepancies about inclusion of studies
and interpretation of data were resolved by arbitration
(PS or FPC), and consensus was reached after discus-
sion. In the case of missing data for potentially suitable
studies, we contacted authors and asked them to pro-
vide the necessary information. To be included in the
meta-analysis a published study had to be an original
article published from January 1966 to December
2008, be a prospective population study, assess salt
intake as baseline exposure, determine either stroke
or total cardiovascular disease prospectively as the out-
come, follow participants for at least three years,
include an adult population, and indicate the number
of participants exposed and the rate or number of
events in different categories of salt intake.

Of the 3246 publications retrieved, we identified 15
studies that met the inclusion criteria. One was a dupli-
cate analysis of a single cohort previously described by
the same authors6 7 and another8 referred to the same
cohort (national health and nutrition examination sur-
vey (NHANES) I) analysed by other authors with more
stringent criteria.9 We therefore included 13 studies in
the meta-analysis that provided suitable data on 19
population samples6 10-21 (tables 1 and 2).

Data extraction
From the identified studies and respective populations
we recorded publication reference, total number of
participants, country, sex, age (mean, median, or
range), recruitment time, follow-up (years), outcome
reported (stroke, cardiovascular disease) and method
of outcome assessment, number (rate) of events,
method of assessing salt intake, and level of salt intake
in different categories.

Categorisation of salt intake differed among studies.
Some reported the number of subjects exposed and the
rate (number) of events across the distribution of salt
intake; others reported differences in the event rate for
a 100 mmol/day difference in sodium intake, as in the

studies by He et al9 and Tuomilehto et al.13 In the last
two cases we used the relative risk or hazard ratio
reported by the authors for the analysis. In all the
cases in which categorisation of the study participants
by level of salt intake was available, we calculated the
relative risk of higher versus lower salt intake by com-
paring the event rate in the two categories with a differ-
ence in average salt intake closest to 100 mmol of
sodium or about 6 g of salt a day.

the inverse of

Statistical analysis
We evaluated the quality of the studies included in the
meta-analysis with the Downs and Black score
system.21 We extracted relative risks or hazard ratios
from the selected publications and calculated their
standard errors from the respective confidence inter-
vals. The value from each study and the corresponding
standard error were transformed into their natural
logarithms to stabilise the variances and to normalise
their distribution. The pooled relative risk (and 95%
confidence interval) was estimated with a random
effect model, weighting for
the
variance.22 The heterogeneity among studies was
tested by Q statistic and quantified by H statistic and I2
statistic.23 The influence of individual studies, from
which the meta-analysis estimates are derived, was
examined by omitting one study at a time to see the
extent to which inferences depend on a particular
study or group of studies (sensitivity analysis). Sub-
group or meta-regression analyses were used to iden-
tify
or
cardiovascular disease and relevant study characteris-
tics (age and sex of participants, year of publication,
duration of follow-up, method of assessment of sodium
intake, difference in sodium level, control for baseline
blood pressure) as possible sources of heterogeneity.
We used funnel plot asymmetry to detect publication
bias and applied Egger’s regression test to measure any
asymmetry.24 25 All statistical analyses were performed
with MIX software version 1.726 and Stata software for
meta-regression analysis.

RESULTS
Characteristics of the study cohorts
We included in the meta-analysis 13 studies reporting
on 19 independent cohorts (table 1). There were
177 025 participants from six different countries (six
studies from the United States, two each from Finland
and Japan, one each from the Netherlands, Scotland,
and Taiwan). Eleven studies recruited both male and
female participants, while two studies included only
men. Follow-up ranged from 3.5 to 19 years. Four stu-
dies reported only stroke events (either total stroke rate
or stroke deaths), three only cardiovascular disease
(total cardiovascular disease rate or cardiovascular dis-
ease deaths), and six reported both. Salt intake was

separately. 6 9 13-15 The TOHP study included two differ-
ent cohorts (I and II) 17 and the study by He and cow-
orkers provided separate findings for men and women
or, alternatively, for normal weight and overweight
participants. 9 Overall, data on the relation between
salt consumption and stroke were available from 14
cohorts and on the relation between salt intake and
cardiovascular disease from 14 cohorts.

The overall study quality, evaluated by the Downs
and Black score, averaged 15.5 (range 12-18) on a scale
of 19 (table 1).

Salt intake and risk of stroke
Table 2 provides data on the relation between salt
intake and risk of stroke in each of the 14 cohorts
included in our study. Figure 1 shows the results of
the pooled analysis. In the pooled analysis, higher salt
intake was associated with greater risk of stroke (rela-
tive risk 1.23, 95% confidence interval 1.06 to 1.43;
P=0.007). There was significant heterogeneity between
studies (P=0.04; I2=61%). The funnel plot did not show
asymmetry, thus excluding publication bias (Egger’s
test P=0.26; see appendix on bmj.com). As shown in

figure 1 for the individual cohorts included in the ana-
lysis, we found a trend towards a direct association
between salt intake and risk of stroke in nine cohorts,
which was significant in four. We observed a non-sig-
nificant inverse trend in three cohorts.

Sensitivity analysis showed that the pooled estimate
of the effect of salt intake on risk of stroke did not vary
substantially with the exclusion of any one study; in
particular, the exclusion of the study by Umesawa et
al,19 which accounted for about 40% of all participants
in the meta-analysis and nearly 20% of all strokes,
resulted in a pooled relative risk of 1.19 (1.03 to 1.39),
P=0.022.

Salt intake and risk of cardiovascular disease
Table 2 provides data on the association between salt
intake and the risk of cardiovascular disease in 14
cohorts. In the pooled analysis, there was an associa-
tion between higher salt intake and risk of cardio-
vascular disease (1.14, 0.99 to 1.32; P=0.07) (fig 2).
The heterogeneity between studies was significant
(P<0.01; I2=80%), but the funnel plot did not show
asymmetry, thus excluding publication bias (Egger’s
test: P=0.39;

evaluation of
individual studies showed a trend
towards a direct association between salt intake and
risk of cardiovascular disease in 10 cohorts, with signif-
icantly higher relative risk in six. An inverse trend was
observed in four cohorts and was significant in one.
Sensitivity analysis showed that the exclusion of the
only study showing a significant inverse trend 6 led to
a pooled estimate of relative risk of 1.17 (1.02 to 1.34),
P=0.02 (fig 2). Further exclusion of the study by Ume-
sawa et al, 19 which accounted for over 50% of all parti-
cipants and about 40% of all cardiovascular disease
events led to a pooled relative risk of 1.14 (0.99 to
1.31), P=0.06.

Sources of heterogeneity
Age—Meta-regression analyses indicated no associa-
tion between mean age of study participants and effect
of sodium intake on the risk of stroke: exp(b)=1.01

(0.99 to 1.03). Likewise, meta-regression showed no
association between age and effect of sodium intake
on the risk of cardiovascular disease: exp(b)=0.99
(0.97 to 1.02).

Sex—Three studies reported data for men and
women separately for incidence of stroke.6 13 14 The
pooled estimates from these three studies were 1.30
(0.64 to 2.65; P=0.47) and 1.56 (1.14 to 2.13; P<0.01),
respectively. Three studies reported data for men and
women separately for incidence of cardiovascular
disease.9 12 13 The pooled estimates were 1.31 (0.97 to
1.77; P=0.08) and 1.27 (1.05 to 1.55; P=0.01), respec-
tively.

Method of assessment of sodium intake—In nine cohorts
that used food frequency questionnaires or dietary
recall for the evaluation of habitual sodium intake the
pooled risk estimate for stroke was 1.25 (1.03 to 1.51;
P=0.02).10-12 14 15 18 19 In five cohorts that used 24 hour

Baseline blood pressure or hypertension status—In the stu-
dies that provided relative risk estimates adjusted for
baseline blood pressure or hypertension status, the
pooled relative risk was 1.22 (1.02 to 1.45; P=0.03)
for stroke (nine cohorts) and 1.25 (0.99 to 1.57;
P=0.06) for cardiovascular disease (seven cohorts).

Baseline body mass index (BMI) or body weight—In the
studies that provided relative risk estimates adjusted
for baseline BMI or body weight, the pooled relative
risk was 1.20 (1.02 to 1.40; P=0.02) for stroke (10
cohorts) and 1.22 (1.00 to 1.49; P=0.05) for cardio-
vascular disease (10 cohorts).

Length

follow-up—Meta-regression

analysis
showed a significant association between duration of
follow-up and the effect of sodium on the risk of stroke.
The log relative risk was estimated to increase by 0.07
per increase of one year of follow-up: exp(b)=1.07
(1.04 to 1.10). The estimated variance between studies
(heterogeneity) was reduced from 0.05 to 0.02. In con-
trast, however, we found no association between dura-
tion of follow-up and effect of sodium on the risk of
cardiovascular disease: exp(b)=0.98 (0.95 to 1.02).

specific difference between higher and lower cate-
gories of sodium intake (differences in sodium intake
values reported in table 2) provided evidence of a sig-
nificant direct association (exp(b)=1.06 (1.03 to 1.10)),
indicating a 6% increase in the rate of stroke for every
50 mmol/day difference in sodium intake. There was a
similar trend for the risk of cardiovascular disease (exp
(b)=1.19 (0.69 to 2.07)), that was not significant.

Time trend (year of publication)—Starting with the first
published study10 we calculated the cumulative pooled
relative risk by stepwise addition of the results of the
other available studies up to the last one published in
July 2008.19 Figure 3 shows the results of these cumu-
lative meta-analyses. The pooled relative risk for
stroke stabilised early in the 1.20-1.30 interval and
achieved significance starting in 2001. Similar results
were obtained in the analysis of cardiovascular disease,
for which the pooled relative risk estimate also stabi-
lised early and close to the final value, achieving signif-
icance starting in 1999.

DISCUSSION
This meta-analysis shows unequivocally that higher
salt intake is associated with a greater incidence of
strokes and total cardiovascular events. Our systematic
review identified 13 relevant and suitable studies pub-
lished from 1996 to 2008. These studies provided evi-
dence from 170 000 people contributing overall more
than 10 000 vascular events.

among people aged over 60 and second among those
aged 15-59. According to the World Health

Fig 2 | Risk of incident cardiovascular disease associated with higher compared with lower salt intake in 14 population cohorts

of the study by Alderman et al6 (men and women), including 102 086 participants and 5044 events

Organization, 62% of all strokes and 49% of coronary
heart disease events are attributable to high blood
pressure.27 The direct causal relation between levels
of dietary salt intake and blood pressure at the popula-
tion level has also been recognised.1 28 29 Given the
graded causal relation between blood pressure and
cardiovascular disease, beginning at around 115 mm
Hg systolic pressure,30 it is reasonable to expect con-
siderable benefit on the rate of cardiovascular disease
from a reduction in salt intake.

Association between salt intake, stroke, and cardiovascular
disease
The results of this meta-analysis provide evidence of a
direct association between high dietary salt intake and
risk of stroke. Despite the considerable heterogeneity
between the 14 cohorts available for the analysis, the
results are strengthened by the lack of major publica-
tion bias and by the observation of a significant associa-
tion in four individual cohorts included in the analysis,
whereas in none was an inverse statistical association
apparent. The pooled relative risk indicates a 23%
greater risk of stroke for an average difference in
sodium intake (weighted for the population size of
each study) of 86 mmol (equivalent to about 5 g of
salt a day). Sensitivity analysis with the exclusion of a
single study, on the basis of its particular weight with
regard to both number of participants and events, only
moderately reduced the difference in risk (from 23% to
19%), which remained significant.

Likewise, the pooled analysis of the 12 cohorts for
which data on cardiovascular disease outcome were
available (after the exclusion of a single outlier) showed
a direct association between higher salt intake and risk
of cardiovascular disease, with a pooled relative risk of
1.17.4 A trend in this direction occurred in as many as
nine of the 12 cohorts and was significant in six. There
was an inverse trend in three cohorts.15 16 20 The study
by Alderman et al,6 showing a relative risk in men of
0.37, has been challenged because of the low number
of events recorded and several methodological inade-
quacies, the most important being the evaluation of
habitual salt consumption on the basis of 24 hour
urine collection obtained shortly after the study parti-
cipants had been instructed to reduce their usual level
of sodium intake.31 The results of sensitivity analysis
indicate that the exclusion of this single study from
our meta-analysis strengthens the estimate. The addi-
tional exclusion of a large Japanese cohort providing a
high proportion of participants and events overall19
only slightly reduced the pooled relative risk estimate
(from 1.17 to 1.14) and the level of significance (to
0.06).

Evaluation of main sources of heterogeneity
We used subgroup and meta-regression analyses to
assess the influence of several factors on the association
between habitual sodium intake and risk of stroke or
cardiovascular disease. For both stroke and cardio-
vascular disease outcomes, separate analyses of the

Fig 3 | Cumulative meta-analysis. Evaluation of time trends
(year of publication) in relation between habitual sodium
intake and risk of stroke or cardiovascular disease

male and female cohorts suggest that the associations
are consistent and not significantly different between
the sexes. Similar results were obtained with respect
to the method of assessment of habitual sodium intake
used in the various studies.

Eight studies provided data adjusted for baseline
blood pressure or hypertension status. Separate eva-
luations of these studies provided relative risk esti-
mates for both stroke and cardiovascular disease
similar to those obtained for the total number of studies
included in the meta-analysis. This finding seems at
variance with the hypothesis that the effect of salt on
cardiovascular risk is substantially mediated by its
unfavourable action on blood pressure. Adjustment
for baseline blood pressure or hypertension status
only partially corrects for the overall influence of
blood pressure on the study results in as much as it

RESEARCH

does not account for changes in blood pressure occur-
ring during the observation period, a problem more
relevant the longer the follow-up period. Part of the
association observed, however, might be mediated by
factors other than blood pressure, and there is evidence
in the literature of deleterious effects of high salt intake
on left ventricular mass,32-34 arterial stiffness,35 and
renal function,36 37 which are not totally explained by
its effect on blood pressure.

Overweight and obesity are often associated with
high blood pressure and are causally involved in the
development of hypertension.38 Nine out of 13 studies
included in the meta-analysis provided relative risk
estimates adjusted for BMI or body weight at entry
into the study.9 14-21 Therefore, as for blood pressure,
the association between habitual sodium intake and
risk of stroke and cardiovascular disease seems partly
independent from the influence of excess body weight.
Two studies, however, reported a significant inter-
action between overweight and habitual sodium intake
on the risk of cardiovascular events.9 13 This finding is
consistent with the description of alterations in renal
tubular sodium handling in obese individuals, making
them particularly sensitive to the effects of high salt
intake.39

Study limitations
The studies included in our meta-analysis were hetero-
geneous regarding sample size, number of events, and
duration of follow-up, with a few cohorts having small
numbers. In the calculation of the pooled relative risk
we weighted the results of the individual studies for
sample size but did not account for the duration of fol-
low-up. Our meta-regression analysis indicated that
the longer the follow-up the greater the effect of habi-
tual sodium intake on the risk of stroke but not, appar-
ently, on the risk of
total cardiovascular events.
Possible explanations for this discrepancy are the
higher mean age at occurrence of stroke, which
would increase the chances of an event the longer the
follow-up, and the closer relation of high blood pres-
sure to stroke compared with other types of vascular
events.

The estimate of the baseline population salt intake in
each study was based on a single measurement
(whether through 24 hour urine collection or dietary
assessment). We were therefore unable to correct for
regression dilution bias. Because of the large day to day
variability within people in salt consumption and the
consequent diluting effect imposed on the average esti-
mate of exposure, our estimates of risk are probably
underestimated.

Categorisation of salt intake was also heterogeneous:
some studies stratified the population by categories of
sodium intake and compared cardiovascular outcomes
across categories, other studies gave a difference in
outcome for a given difference (for example,
100 mmol/24 h) in sodium intake or excretion. To
standardise our comparison between higher and
lower salt consumption we sought to refer to a differ-
ence as close as possible to 100 mmol or 6 g a day

WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPIC

Experimental, epidemiological, migration, and intervention studies have shown a causal
relation between habitual dietary salt intake and blood pressure

Population based intervention studies and meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials
have shown that it is possible to achieve significant reductions in blood pressure with
reduced salt intake in both hypertensive and normotensive individuals

WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS

Higher salt intake is associated with significantly greater incidence of strokes and total
cardiovascular events, with a dose dependent association

A difference of 5 g a day in habitual salt intake is associated with a 23% difference in the rate
of stroke and 17% difference in the rate of total cardiovascular disease

Each year a 5 g reduction in daily salt intake at the population level could avert some one and
a quarter million deaths from stroke and almost three million deaths from cardiovascular
disease worldwide

in this

between high and low salt intake. Nevertheless, there
remained appreciable differences
respect
between studies. We tried to overcome the problem
with meta-regression analysis, which provided evi-
dence of a highly significant dose-response relation
between the difference in sodium intake and the
increase in risk of both stroke and cardiovascular dis-
ease.

Implications
The habitual salt intake in most Western countries is
close to 10 g a day (and much higher in many Eastern
European and Asian countries), and we calculated that
the average difference between higher and lower salt
intake across the study cohorts included in our meta-
analysis was 5 g a day. Given this approach, we believe
that, despite the inherent inaccuracies, the results of
our meta-analysis are applicable to real life conditions.
A reduction of 5 g (about one teaspoon) of salt would
bring consumption close to the WHO recommended
level (5 g a day at the population level).

According to a recent report of the World Heart Fed-
eration there are over 5.5 million deaths a year from
stroke throughout the world and close to 17.5 million
deaths a year from cardiovascular disease.40 Given that
the case fatality rates for stroke is estimated at one in
three and those for total cardiovascular disease at one
in five, a 23% reduction in the rate of stroke and a 17%
overall reduction in the rate of cardiovascular disease
attributable to a reduction in population salt intake
could avert some one and a quarter million deaths
from stroke and almost three million deaths from
cardiovascular disease each year. Many studies have
also shown that a reduction in salt intake is cost
effective,41-43 arguing for the more widespread intro-
duction of national programmes to reduce dietary salt
consumption. In recent years, a few countries have
made some progress towards reduction of habitual
salt intake through a voluntary approach1 or by regula-
tion, as in Finland,42 but levels of salt consumption are
still far from the WHO recommended targets. There
are many reasons for these delays. One barrier to a

more effective implementation of public health poli-
cies has been the historical opposition of the food
industry,44 based on the arguments that the available
evidence does not show significant benefits on hard
end points at a population level from a moderate
reduction in salt
intake. Our study now clearly
addresses those doubts. Some progress has been
made in the past few years by closer collaboration
between governments, public health bodies, and
some sectors of the industry on a “voluntary” basis, as
in the UK, with the reformulation of many food items
towards a lower salt content and proposals of improved
labelling. These efforts have led to a reduction of 0.9 g a
day (or about 10%) in population salt intake in four
years (from 9.5 to 8.6 g a day), still far from the recom-
mended 6 g a day initial targets that were set in the UK.
While the voluntary approach is the preferred choice
for many governments, the “regulatory” approach has
advantages,45 sometimes being the most efficient,
effective, and cost effective way of achieving public
health targets.41-43 For population salt
intake to
approach the recommended targets within a reason-
able time frame, an “upstream” approach is now neces-
sary alongside the traditional “downstream” public
health approach based on health promotion and beha-
vioural changes.

Background and aims: Whole grain food sources have been associated
Abstract
with lowered risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Studies in recent years have
strengthened this observation and elucidated potential mechanisms for this associ-
ation. This study sought to quantitate the available observational evidence on
whole grain intake and clinical cardiovascular events.
Methods and results: Seven prospective cohort studies with quantitative measures
of dietary whole grains and clinical cardiovascular outcomes were identiﬁed from
MEDLINE searches and a review of the literature. Based on event estimates
adjusted for cardiovascular risk factors, greater whole grain intake (pooled average
2.5 servings/d vs. 0.2 servings/d) was associated with a 21% lower risk of CVD
events [OR 0.79 (95% CI: 0.73e0.85)]. Similar estimates were noted for different
CVD outcomes (heart disease, stroke, fatal CVD) and in sex-speciﬁc analyses. Con-
versely, reﬁned grain intake was not associated with incident CVD events [1.07
(0.94e1.22)].
Conclusions: There is a consistent, inverse association between dietary whole
grains and incident cardiovascular disease in epidemiological cohort studies. In light
of this evidence, policy-makers, scientists, and clinicians should redouble efforts to
incorporate clear messages on the beneﬁcial effects of whole grains into public
health and clinical practice endeavors.

Organization estimates that, over the next two
decades, developing countries will bear the brunt
of the increasing burden of CVD [1]. Over thirty
years ago, Dr. Trowell noted that sub-Saharan Africa
had a lower prevalence of ischemic heart disease
than industrialized European and American popula-
tions, hypothesizing that observed differences were
attributable to the relative intake of reﬁned versus
whole plant food sources [2]. This came to be known
as the ‘‘ﬁber hypothesis’’, which related ﬁber in-
take from cereal and plant sources to chronic heart
and gastrointestinal diseases. The ﬁrst prospective
evaluation of the ‘‘ﬁber hypothesis’’ with respect
to heart disease came from the United Kingdom
[3]. Morris et al. found that cereal ﬁber (but not veg-
etable ﬁber) was negatively associated with inci-
dent ischemic heart disease. The ﬁrst study to
prospectively associate whole grain consumption
with cardiovascular events was the Seventh Day
Adventists’ study, in which individuals who con-
sumed wheat bread had a 55% lower risk of non-fatal
MI than those who ate white bread [4]. In 2003, Dr.
Anderson synthesized data from thirteen studies
evaluating intake of whole grains, fruits, vegeta-
bles, and ﬁber with respect to risk for clinical cardio-
vascular disease [5]. Of ﬁve studies prospectively
evaluating whole grain intake and cardiovascular
risk, higher intake of whole grains was associated
with a 29% lower risk for cardiovascular events (ad-
justed RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.48e0.94). However, since
this analysis, multiple observational studies have
replicated this association and important causal
pathways have been elucidated, including effects
on glucose homeostasis, serum lipids, and endothe-
lial function. We sought to quantitate the available
observational evidence on whole grain intake and
clinical cardiovascular events and review the poten-
tial mechanisms of this association.

Methods

We identiﬁed observational studies that evaluated
the association between whole grain intake and
clinical cardiovascular events using the following
inclusion criteria: 1. the studies were performed
using self-reported quantitative measures of whole
grain intake (e.g. servings/day); 2. cardiovascular
events were ascertained prospectively; and 3. the
studies provided adequate data to generate ad-
justed event rates. Studies were identiﬁed from
a MEDLINE search for ‘whole grain’ and ‘cardiovas-
cular disease’ from 1966 to April 2006. Additional
studies were drawn from reference lists of relevant
manuscripts. Data were extracted by two indepen-
dent
investigators, and inconsistencies were

resolved by mutual agreement. For within-study
comparisons, individuals in the highest quantile of
whole grain intake were compared to individuals
with the lowest whole grain intake. Covariate-
adjusted event rates were derived from published
event rates and adjusted relative risk estimates. For
studies that reported risk estimates for multiple
cardiovascular endpoints, the most comprehensive
cardiovascular disease endpoint was utilized for the
primary analysis. For studies that evaluated this
association in multiple models, we evaluated esti-
mates based on demographic-adjusted models and
more fully-adjusted models (i.e. including cardio-
vascular risk factors) separately. Secondary analy-
ses evaluated speciﬁc endpoints (coronary heart
disease (CHD)/CHD mortality, ischemic stroke/
stroke mortality) and subgroups (men, women)
based on risk-factor adjusted estimates. Addition-
ally, the relationship between reﬁned grain intake
and cardiovascular events was assessed using stud-
ies that provided this information.

We identiﬁed eight publications from seven
cohorts with both quantitative whole grain esti-
mates and clinical cardiovascular event rates that
included sufﬁcient data for analysis (Table 1). Other
reports of interest were excluded for the following
reasons: restrospective study design [6], use of
qualitative rather than quantitative whole grain
measures (i.e. ‘‘What type of bread do you use?’’)
[4], and presentation of data subsequently updated
[7]. Studies that met entry criteria and provided suf-
ﬁcient data were included in the analyses, with
study weights based on the inverse variance. For
the main and secondary analyses, we evaluated
the Mantel-Haentzel
for heterogeneity.
As there was no evidence of signiﬁcant heterogene-
ity (Q ¼ 0.04e8.17, p ¼ 0.07e0.83), ﬁxed-effects
models were used. Publication bias was evaluated
using funnel plots and the Egger test [8], and sensi-
tivity analyses corrected for bias using the trim-and-
ﬁll method [9]. All analyses were performed using
MIX v. 1.2 (Kitasato University, 2006; http://
www.mix-for-meta-analysis.info/index.html).

Results

Six studies provided information for demographic-
adjusted analyses [10e15], and seven included in-
formation for risk-factor-adjusted analyses [10e
16] (Table 2). Among these cohorts, the pooled aver-
age intake of those with high intake was 2.5 serv-
ings/d, while consumption in the comparison
group averaged 0.2 servings/day. High intake of
whole grains was associated with a 37% lower risk
of incident cardiovascular disease in the analyses

based on demographic-adjusted estimates [OR .63
(95% CI 0.58e0.68)] (Fig. 1). This association was ev-
ident in analyses based on risk-factor-adjusted esti-
mates, as well [0.79 (0.73e0.85)]. Though there was
evidence of publication bias when evaluated with
the Egger test (intercept ¼   2.32, p ¼ 0.001), the
results were similar in analyses that corrected for
this using the trim-and-ﬁll method [0.81 (0.75e
0.87)]. The results did not differ after removing
one study [16] that included individuals with preva-
lent cardiovascular disease [0.79 (0.73e0.86)].

The ﬁndings were similar when analyses were
restricted to studies that provided sex-speciﬁc
results for men [0.82 (0.73e0.92)]
[13,15] or
women [0.79 (0.68e0.91)]
[10,11]. Estimates
were similar when analyses were limited to studies
that reported fatal CVD endpoints [0.78 (0.70e
0.88)] [10,12,13,16]. This association was also
present when evaluating the endpoint of incident
CHD [0.76 (0.69e0.83)] [7,11e15], but an apparent
association was less signiﬁcant for incident stroke
[0.83 (0.68e1.02)] [10,13,14,17]. There was no ev-
idence of decreased risk for cardiovascular events
when comparing groups with high versus low re-
ﬁned grain intake [1.07 (0.94e1.22)] [10,13,14].

Discussion

The inverse association between whole grain in-
take and cardiovascular disease has been consis-
tently demonstrated in multiple observational
studies.

that consumption of 2.5 servings of whole grains
was associated with a 21% lower risk of incident
CVD compared to intake of 0.2 servings per day,
after adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors.
Similarly, whole grain intake is inversely associated
with atherosclerosis, the common pathway for
ischemic heart disease. In one study of 229 post-
menopausal women, six or more servings of whole
grain products per week was associated with 40%
less coronary atherosclerotic progression [18]. As
this evidence on the association of whole grain in-
take with atherosclerosis and clinical cardiovascu-
lar disease has been accumulating, other research
continues to elucidate mechanisms whereby whole
grains inﬂuence cardiovascular health.

Whole grain intake and CVD risk:
potential mechanisms

Grains consist of bran, germ, and endosperm
components. When reﬁned, the carbohydrate-
rich endosperm component is retained, while
many biologically active agents, such as ﬁber,
vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and other plant
compounds (lignans, phytosterols, etc.) are re-
moved with the bran and germ [19]. These biolog-
ical agents inﬂuence cardiovascular risk through
effects on glucose homeostasis [20,21], lipids and
lipoproteins [16,22], endothelial function [23],
and other mechanisms [24e26], potentially ac-
counting for much of the observed beneﬁt of high
intake of whole grains.

Whole grain intake, insulin resistance, and
type 2 diabetes mellitus

The World Health Organization estimates the
worldwide prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus
(T2DM) to be 170 million, with an anticipated 50%
increase by 2010. The greatest increase is occur-
ring in countries undergoing the transition to
‘‘Western’’ lifestyle patterns [27]. In the United
States, the prevalence of T2DM increased 765%
from 1935 to 1996 [28]. Ecologic data suggest
that the increasing prevalence of T2DM accom-
panies a parallel increase in total energy intake,
the majority of which comes from reﬁned carbohy-
drates [28,29]. This is supported by prospective
data from the Nurses’ Health Study, in which in-
take of sugar-sweetened beverages was associated
with weight gain and incident T2DM [30].

Conversely, higher intake of unreﬁned carbohy-
drates, such as whole grains, appears to be pro-
tective against insulin resistance and T2DM. Whole
grain meals are associated with reduced glucose and

288

insulin responses [20], and longer feeding studies
indicate that increased whole grain intake may
improve insulin sensitivity or beta-cell function
[31,32]. Cross-sectional studies have shown that
whole grain intake is inversely associated with insu-
lin resistance [21,33] and components of the meta-
bolic syndrome [16,34]. Furthermore, multiple
longitudinal cohort studies have demonstrated an
inverse relationship between whole grain or cereal
ﬁber intake and incident T2DM. In a meta-analysis
by Liu, individuals with higher whole grain intake
had a 30% lower risk of incident T2DM compared to
those with low whole grain intake [35]. The beneﬁ-
cial effects of whole grains on glucose homeostasis
are likely attributable to the speciﬁc carbohydrates
found in whole grains (including ﬁber [36,37], re-
sistant starches [38] and oligosaccharides [20]),
physical factors that determine carbohydrate ab-
sorption [20], phytochemicals (e.g. lignans) [39],
and magnesium [40].

Whole grain effects on lipids

Though effects on insulin sensitivity and glycemia
are likely a major component of the cardiopro-
tective beneﬁt realized with increased consump-
tion of whole grains, early evaluations of unreﬁned
grain sources emphasized cholesterol as the cen-
tral mechanism of cardiovascular beneﬁt. Dr.
Trowell’s ecologic observations focused on total
cholesterol levels as a reﬂection of carbohydrate
source [2], noting that cholesterol levels across
populations were more strongly associated with
ﬁber intake than amount or type of fat. Since
then, an abundance of evidence has demonstrated
an inverse relationship between intake of soluble
ﬁber (most often consumed as b-glucan from
oats [41]) and LDL-cholesterol [42]. Animal models
suggest that this effect is mediated, in part, by in-
creased bile acid degradation and loss [43], dis-
rupting
and
reducing the amount of cholesterol available for
LDL synthesis [44], which in turn leads to an upre-
gulation of hepatic LDL receptors [45]. In addition
to soluble ﬁber, whole grains are also rich in phy-
tosterols, which compete with cholesterol for ab-
sorption in the small
lowering LDL
cholesterol [22,46]. Whole grains are also associ-
ated with a reduction in small LDL cholesterol
[47]. In addition to effects on LDL, whole grains in-
ﬂuence the insulin resistant lipid pattern (ele-
vated triglycerides and low HDL cholesterol)
associated with the metabolic syndrome [16].
Thus, whole grains could confer cardiovascular
beneﬁts by acting on numerous
lipid inter-
mediates, including LDL (amount and size), HDL,

enterohepatic

intestine,

bile

circulation

and triglycerides, resulting in a lipid proﬁle that
is globally less atherogenic.

Whole grains and endothelial function

Whole grain constituents also appear to inﬂuence
the vascular endothelium directly. Endothelial
dysfunction is an early development in the path-
ophysiology of atherosclerosis [48]. Whole grain in-
terventions have been shown to improve vascular
reactivity, a marker of endothelial function, in re-
sponse to a high fat meal [23], and dietary patterns
associated with high intake of whole grains are as-
sociated with improved plasma markers of endo-
thelial function [49,50]. Whole grains are rich in
lignans, phytoestrogens whose intakes have been
associated with decreased cardiovascular death
[51], presumably through beneﬁcial effects on
the endothelium. Furthermore, whole grains are
rich in antioxidants, including vitamin E, which
may have a signiﬁcant beneﬁcial effect on the vas-
cular endothelium [52].

Whole grains: other mechanisms of
cardiovascular beneﬁt

In addition to their effects on insulin sensitivity,
lipids, and endothelial function, whole grains may
inﬂuence other parameters that shape cardiovas-
cular risk, including blood pressure [24], plasma
homocysteine [25], and inﬂammation [26]. Thus,
whole grains are a complex food source with pleo-
tropic effects, and the cardiovascular beneﬁts as-
sociated increased dietary whole grains involve
multiple pathways.

Conclusions

Despite the abundant evidence in support of in-
creasing whole grain intake and a diverse assort-
ment of whole grain food sources (Table 3), intake
remains low. Data from the National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey 1999e2000 found
that only 8% of U.S. adults consume three or
more servings of whole grain per day, with most
whole grains consumed in snack foods (41%) [fol-
lowed by cereals (32%), breads (18%) and other
sources (9%)] [53]. The same data revealed that
42% of adults eat no whole grains on a given day.
Many consumers and health professionals are un-
aware of the health beneﬁts of whole grains [54].
This may improve as guidelines begin to make
whole grain recommendations more explicit
[53,55].

In summary, dietary whole grains have been
inversely associated with cardiovascular risk fac-
tors, atherosclerosis, and incident cardiovascular
disease. In light of this consistent evidence, policy-
makers, scientists, and clinicians should redouble
efforts to incorporate clear messages on the
beneﬁcial effects of whole grains into public
health and clinical practice endeavors.

Effects of dietary fatty acids and carbohydrates on the ratio of
serum total to HDL cholesterol and on serum lipids and
apolipoproteins: a meta-analysis of 60 controlled trials1–3

Ronald P Mensink, Peter L Zock, Arnold DM Kester, and Martijn B Katan

ABSTRACT
Background: The effects of dietary fats on the risk of coronary
artery disease (CAD) have traditionally been estimated from their
effects on LDL cholesterol. Fats, however, also affect HDL cho-
lesterol, and the ratio of total to HDL cholesterol is a more specific
marker of CAD than is LDL cholesterol.
Objective: The objective was to evaluate the effects of individual
fatty acids on the ratis of total to HDL cholesterol and on serum
lipoproteins.
Design: We performed a meta-analysis of 60 selected trials and
calculated the effects of the amount and type of fat on total:HDL
cholesterol and on other lipids.
Results: The ratio did not change if carbohydrates replaced satu-
rated fatty acids, but it decreased if cis unsaturated fatty acids
replaced saturated fatty acids. The effect on total:HDL cholesterol
of replacing trans fatty acids with a mix of carbohydrates and cis
unsaturated fatty acids was almost twice as large as that of replac-
ing saturated fatty acids. Lauric acid greatly increased total cho-
lesterol, but much of its effect was on HDL cholesterol. Conse-
quently, oils rich in lauric acid decreased the ratio of total to HDL
cholesterol. Myristic and palmitic acids had little effect on the
ratio, and stearic acid reduced the ratio slightly. Replacing fats with
carbohydrates increased fasting triacylglycerol concentrations.
Conclusions: The effects of dietary fats on total:HDL cholesterol
may differ markedly from their effects on LDL. The effects of fats
on these risk markers should not in themselves be considered to
reflect changes in risk but should be confirmed by prospective
observational studies or clinical trials. By that standard, risk is
reduced most effectively when trans fatty acids and saturated fatty
acids are replaced with cis unsaturated fatty acids. The effects of
carbohydrates and of lauric acid–rich fats on CAD risk remain
uncertain.

vational, mechanistic, and genetic evidence that increasing the con-
centration of HDL cholesterol through diet will lower the risk of
CAD  (3–6).  In  addition, a  study  with  gemfibrozil  showed  that
increasing the concentration of HDL cholesterol lowers the risk of
CAD (7). In fact, the ratio of total to HDL cholesterol is considered
more important than the total or lipoprotein cholesterol concentra-
tions in estimating the risk of CAD (8–10). There is thus a need for
coefﬁcients that estimate the effect of fats on total:HDL cholesterol.
This report presents such coefﬁcients, which are based on the out-
comes of selected studies published by investigators in 11 countries
from  1970  through  1998.  The  effects  of  dietary  fatty  acids  on
plasma apolipoprotein (apo) B and apo A-I were also evaluated.

METHODS

Selection of studies

Original-research  studies  that  were  published  in  English
between January 1970 and December 1998 were selected through
a computer-assisted literature search. We also scanned reference
lists and performed hands-on searches of journals. Studies had to
meet a number of criteria.

1) Food intake had to be thoroughly controlled and described,
with dietary fatty acids as the sole variable. Cholesterol intake
had to be constant; because animal fats high in saturated fatty
acids (SFAs) are generally high in dietary cholesterol, and veg-
etable oils high in unsaturated fatty acids are low in choles-
terol, it would otherwise be difficult to reliably identify the
independent effects of fatty acids or dietary cholesterol. If nec-
essary, cholesterol intake was kept constant by using eggs or
egg yolk or by adding crystalline cholesterol to the diets.

INTRODUCTION

The effects of dietary fats on the risk of coronary artery disease
(CAD) have traditionally been estimated from their effects on serum
total cholesterol (1, 2). As a result, fats high in lauric, myristic, and
palmitic acids, such as dairy fat and tropical oils, were considered
the most noxious of fats, and diets low in fat and high in carbohy-
drates were considered optimal. Such an approach, however, ignores
the effects of diet on HDL cholesterol. There is a wealth of obser-

2) Studies  had  to  have  a  parallel, crossover, or  Latin-square
design. Before-and-after (sequential) designs that lacked a con-
trol group were excluded.

3) Feeding  periods  had  to  be  sufficiently  long  to  allow  the
achievement of new steady-state concentrations of serum lipids
and lipoproteins, ie, > 13 d (1, 11).

4) Only adult subjects (aged > 17 y) who did not have distur-

bances of lipid metabolism or diabetes were included.

We excluded studies that focused on very-long-chain (n⫺3)
polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) such as fish oils. The effects
of these oils have been reviewed elsewhere (12). Therefore, in this
report, total PUFAs may be considered to equal the n⫺6 PUFAs
with 18 carbon atoms (linoleic acid plus some ␣-linolenic acid).
We also excluded studies on medium-chain fatty acids, because
there were too few to allow proper statistical analysis.

To convert them to serum values, plasma concentrations of total
and HDL cholesterol were multiplied by 1.030 and those for tria-
cylglycerols were multiplied by 1.029 (13). LDL-cholesterol con-
centrations were calculated (14). For the sake of uniformity, we
also recalculated the ratio of total to HDL cholesterol and the
LDL-cholesterol concentrations, even if they were reported by the
authors of the report. Plasma values for apo B and apo A-I were
also multiplied by 1.030 to convert them to serum values.

On average, dietary fat contains 96% (by wt) fatty acids; the
other 4% is made up of glycerol and other lipids (15). For publi-
cations in which the intakes of the various fatty acid classes had
been normalized to add up to 100% of total fat, we converted
intakes back to true fatty acid intakes by multiplying them by 0.96.

Statistical analysis

Each data point consisted of the fatty acid composition of a par-
ticular diet (the independent variable) and the mean ratio of serum
total to HDL cholesterol or the mean serum lipid or apolipoprotein
concentration (the dependent variable) of a group of subjects, as
obtained at the end of a dietary period. In all trials, fatty acids
were exchanged for either other fatty acids or carbohydrates. Pos-
sible effects of protein and alcohol thus could not be estimated.
The regression coefficients estimated in this way are the predicted
change in the ratio of serum total to cholesterol or in the serum
lipid or apolipoprotein concentrations when carbohydrate intake
decreases  by  1%  of  energy  and  that  of  a  particular  fatty  acid
increases by the same amount (16).

Two different models were used for SFAs and cis unsaturated
fatty acids, and a third approach was used for trans fatty acids.
The  models  used  as  dependent  variables  the  absolute  lipid  or
apolipoprotein concentrations during particular diets rather than
changes induced by diet. Therefore, all models were corrected for
the intrinsic concentrations to ensure that only within-study diet-
induced differences were analyzed. The intrinsic concentration is
a constant for a particular study. It reflects the mean estimated
serum lipid or apolipoprotein concentration or their ratios that
would result if this particular group of subjects consumed a stan-
dardized fat-free, high-carbohydrate diet. The intrinsic concen-
tration is determined by such factors as genetic makeup, age, and
body mass index and by such factors as the fiber, protein, or alco-
hol content of the background diet, which was constant within
studies but differed between studies.

In the first model, the effects on a particular outcome of all fatty
acids within a certain category—SFAs, cis monounsaturated fatty
acids (MUFAs), or n⫺6 cis PUFAs—were estimated. Diets in

which the fatty acid composition of a particular class of fatty acids
diverged markedly from that in normal mixed diets were excluded.
For example, Grande et al (17) specifically examined the effects
of stearic acid on serum lipids. Because stearic acid is hypocho-
lesterolemic compared with other SFAs (2), including this data
point would have resulted in a biased estimate of the effect of a
normal mixture of SFAs.

The second model estimated the effects of individual SFAs. The
proportions of energy from lauric, myristic, palmitic, and stearic
acids were used as independent variables, together with the sum
of all cis MUFAs and the sum of all cis PUFAs. Diets rich in trans
fatty acids were not included.

The validity of the regression models was examined in several
ways (18). First, the influence of each separate observation (ie,
trial or trial arm) on the estimated regression coefficients was
assessed with the use of Cook’s distance to detect possible out-
liers. Our initial analysis showed that there were 1 or 2 observa-
tions with Cook’s distance > 0.3 that caused nonnormality of the
residuals. Excluding these observations did not change our con-
clusions but resulted in normally distributed variables as indicated
by the Shapiro-Wilk test (18) and narrower confidence intervals,
a measure of the variability in dietary response between studies.
Therefore, we decided to exclude from the final analysis observa-
tions with Cook’s distances > 0.3. Another source of errors in
regression statistics can be collinearity—ie, correlations between
supposedly independent variables (in this case, the various fatty
acids). Collinearity can be quantitated as tolerance. For all mod-
els used, the tolerance for each fatty acid was ≥ 0.22, which indi-
cated that relation between the independent variables did not lead
to inappropriate estimates of the regression coefficients. Finally,
visual inspection of plots did not suggest a relation between resid-
uals and predicted values or between residuals and the independ-
ent variables. This suggests that the differences between observed
and predicted values (ie, the residuals) did not depend on the
absolute serum lipid or lipoprotein of a trial or on the absolute
intake of a particular fatty acid or class of fatty acids. All statisti-
cal analyses were carried out with PROC REG software, version 6
(19). Each study was represented by a dummy variable (the intrin-
sic concentration). The use of a random-effects model, which is
frequently used in meta-analyses to correct for error within a
study, was not possible, because it requires standard errors of
treatment differences within studies, which generally were not
given. Therefore, we  could  not  differentiate  within-study  and
between-study variability. However, the estimates of the regres-
sion coefficients in the present analysis would have been compa-
rable with those of a random-effects analysis.

The effects of trans MUFAs were examined in a different way
because the number of studies was too small for multiple regres-
sion analysis. For each single study, the difference in outcome
variables between the trans diet and the control diet was adjusted
for differences in the intakes of other fatty acids with the use of the
results from the regression analysis described above. The effects
of trans MUFAs relative to those of carbohydrates were calculated
per 1% of energy, and the results from the various studies were
then averaged.

RESULTS

The 60 trials that met our criteria yielded 159 diet data points
and  included  1672  volunteers, at  a  ratio  of  men  to  women  of
70:30.  Thirty-four  studies  were  from  the  United  States  (17,

(64–67); 3 from Canada (68–70); 2 each from Finland (71, 72),
Israel (73, 74), Malaysia (75, 76), and Norway (77, 78); and 1
each from Germany (79), Italy (80), and the United Kingdom (81,
82). The test diets were fed for 13–91 d. For 40 studies, mean
prestudy  concentrations  of  total  cholesterol  were  given;  they
ranged between 3.7 and 6.5 mmol/L. Eleven studies were carried
out on an inpatient basis, whereas 6 studies used liquid formula
diets. Fifty-one trials reported the mean age of their participants,
which varied between 21 and 72 y. Analysis of residuals did not
suggest that study characteristics (eg, length of the feeding peri-
ods, inpatient or outpatient studies, mixed solid diets or liquid for-
mula diets) were important determinants of the observed changes
in serum lipid or lipoproteins as responses to a change in diet.
Moreover, excluding the inpatient studies or the studies that used
liquid formula diets did not change the conclusions.

Classes of fatty acids

The number of diet data points included in the calculations var-
ied from 102 for total:HDL cholesterol to 114 for total cholesterol
concentration (Table 1). In these diets, the mean intakes of fat,
SFAs, MUFAs, and PUFAs were 34.3% of total daily energy
(range: 4.5–53.0%), 10.2% of energy (2.2–24.4%), 13.5% of
energy (1.5–39.8%), and 8.8% of energy (0.6–28.8%), respectively.
The regression coefficients (Table 1 and Figure 1) showed that
total:HDL cholesterol did not change if SFAs were replaced with
carbohydrates, because total and HDL cholesterol decreased to a
similar extent. The ratio decreased if SFAs or carbohydrates were
replaced  with  cis  unsaturated  fatty  acids.  As  shown  in
Figure 2, the observed and predicted values for total:HDL cho-
lesterol were in excellent agreement.

The effects of the classes of fatty acids on serum total, LDL,
and HDL cholesterol concentrations and on serum triacylglycerol
concentrations agreed well with the results of our earlier meta-
analysis (16). The cis MUFAs had a modest but significant LDL
cholesterol–lowering effect relative to carbohydrates. All 3 classes
of fatty acids increased HDL cholesterol relative to carbohydrates.
Unsaturated fatty acids increased HDL cholesterol less than did

SFAs. As a result, the replacement of 1% of energy in the form of
SFAs with an equal percentage in the form of cis MUFAs is pre-
dicted to lower HDL-cholesterol concentrations by 0.002 mmol/L.
A similar decrease is expected when 1% of energy in the form of
MUFAs  is  replaced  with  an  equal  percentage  in  the  form  of
PUFAs. These effects, however, are small compared with those of
replacement of carbohydrates with any of the 3 classes of fatty
acids. Replacement of carbohydrates with any class of fatty acids
decreased fasting serum triacylglycerol concentrations (Table 1).
The effect was slightly but not significantly larger for PUFAs than
for other fatty acids. This contrasts with the powerful triacylglyc-
erol-lowering effect of n⫺3 PUFAs from fish (12), which is evi-
dently not shared by linoleic acid, the major n⫺6 PUFA.

Replacement of carbohydrates with SFAs did not change
apo B concentrations. The cis unsaturated fatty acids, however,
decreased apo B, and this effect was slightly stronger for PUFAs.

urated fatty acids. *P < 0.05; +P < 0.01; ¥P < 0.001.

trans MUFAs

In the 8 studies that specifically examined trans MUFAS, the
intake of trans MUFAs ranged between 0.0 and 10.9% of energy;
these values include the trans fatty acid–free control diets in these
studies. As shown in Table 3, trans 18:1 has the largest effect of
all the fatty acids on total:HDL cholesterol. Furthermore, trans
18:1 does not increase HDL cholesterol or apo A-I concentrations
relative to carbohydrates. Isoenergetic replacement of trans 18:1
constituting 1% of energy with SFAs decreased total:HDL cho-
lesterol by 0.019; replacement with cis MUFAs, by 0.048; and
replacement with cis PUFAs, by 0.054.

Effects of actual food fats

Predicted changes in total:HDL cholesterol are shown in
Figure 4 when mixed fat constituting 10% of energy in the “aver-
age” US diet (55, 83) is replaced with one particular fat source or
with carbohydrates. For animal fats, we adjusted for the slight
effects of dietary cholesterol on this ratio (84). The largest reduc-
tion is seen with unhydrogenated oils, such as rapeseed, soybean,
and olive oils. Replacement of the average fat with stick mar-
garines or butter would cause a small increase in the ratio, but,
surprisingly, so would replacement with carbohydrates.

DISCUSSION

Is total:HDL cholesterol a reliable predictor of risk?

The  use  of  total:HDL  cholesterol  implies  that  diet-induced
decreases in HDL cholesterol increase CAD risk. Such a causal
role for diet-induced changes in HDL cholesterol has not been
proven in controlled clinical trials. However, results of prospective
observational studies, controlled clinical trials with drugs, mech-
anistic studies, and genetic “experiments of nature” all strongly
suggest that high concentrations of HDL cholesterol in the circu-
lation help to prevent  CAD and other  cardiovascular  diseases
(3–7). Given these observations, it appears imprudent to ignore
the marked effects of diet on HDL cholesterol. An additional jus-
tification for using total:HDL cholesterol might be that it includes
the amount of cholesterol in the triacylglycerol-rich VLDL frac-
tion, which also positively correlates with CAD risk (85). How-
ever, our analysis also underlines the fact that effects of diet on
biomarkers such as blood lipids can never replace studies that
employ disease or death as outcomes. Total:HDL cholesterol is
more sensitive and specific than is total cholesterol as a risk pre-
dictor (8–10), but the favorable effects on this ratio by such fac-
tors as coconut fat, which is rich in lauric acid, do not exclude the
possibility that coconut fat may promote CAD through other path-
ways, known or as yet unknown. Similarly, the unfavorable effect
of carbohydrates on the ratio does not rule out a favorable effect
of high-carbohydrate diets on health outcomes.

Predicted effects on coronary artery disease risk

Epidemiologic  studies  suggest  that  a  change  of  1  U  in
total:HDL cholesterol is associated with a 53% change in the risk
of myocardial infarction (9). We can use this figure and the coef-
ficients in Table 1 to speculate about the effect of changes in fatty
acid intake on the risk of CAD. The most clear-cut test of such
speculations is provided by the clinical trials of dietary fat and
heart disease. For the Finnish Mental Hospital Trial, our coeffi-
cients predict a decrease of 18% in the incidence of CAD in both
sexes, compared with actual decreases of 44% in men (86) and

FIGURE 2. Scatterplot showing observed versus predicted ratios of
serum total to HDL cholesterol. Each point refers to a specific test diet in
one of the studies. “Predicted” values were calculated as the intrinsic con-
centration of the group under study plus the predicted change induced by
their  test  diet  (see Table 1).  The  intrinsic  concentration  reflects  the
total:HDL cholesterol that would result if this particular group of subjects
consumed a standardized fat-free, high-carbohydrate diet. It is determined
by factors such as genetic makeup, age, and body mass index and by fac-
tors such as the fiber, protein, or alcohol content of the background diet,
which was constant within studies but differed between studies. (Carbo-
hydrates → SFAs), (Carbohydrates → MUFAs), and (Carbohydrates →
PUFAs), percentage of energy in the form of carbohydrates replaced with
an equal percentage in the form of saturated fatty acids, cis monounsatu-
rated fatty acids, or cis polyunsaturated acids, respectively.

SFAs and MUFAs increased apo A-I concentrations relative to
carbohydrates. PUFAs did not significantly change apo A-I con-
centrations.

Individual saturated fatty acids

Intakes of individual SFAs were reported for 35 studies, yield-
ing 91 data points. The mean intakes of lauric, myristic, palmitic,
and stearic acids were 1.1% of total daily energy (0.0–16.9%),
1.3% of energy (0.0–14.3%), 6.2% of energy (1.0–19.9%), and
3.0% of energy (0.7–16.5%), respectively. The diet with the high-
est lauric acid intake, 16.9% of energy (42), was included in the
model for total:HDL cholesterol but excluded from the models for
total, LDL, and HDL cholesterol, because its Cook’s distance
exceeded 0.3 (see Methods). The next highest lauric acid intake
was 10.7% of energy.

Although lauric acid was the most potent total and LDL cho-
lesterol–raising SFA (Table 2 and Figure 3), it actually decreased
total:HDL cholesterol relative to carbohydrates. Thus, the choles-
terol-raising effect of lauric acid is proportionally higher for HDL
than for LDL. The ratio of total to HDL cholesterol was less
affected by the other 3 SFAs, although it was somewhat more
favorably affected by stearic acid than by myristic or palmitic acid.
The HDL cholesterol–raising effects of the various SFAs rela-
tive to carbohydrates decreased with increasing chain length, from
0.027 mmol/L per % of energy for lauric acid to ⬇0 mmol/L per
% of energy for stearic acid. Replacement of the different SFAs
with carbohydrates increased serum triacylglycerol concentrations
to the same extent.

36% in women (87). For the Veterans Administration trial, the pre-
dicted and observed changes are 20% and 24%, respectively (88).
Predicted effects are thus somewhat lower than observed effects,
which suggests that dietary fatty acids also affect other risk factors
for CAD. Epidemiologic observations, however, suggest a much
larger effect of changes in the amount and quality of dietary fat
and carbohydrates on CAD risk (89), and the possible reasons for
this were discussed elsewhere (90, 91).

Effects of fatty acids and carbohydrates on serum lipids and
lipoproteins

Our results suggest that isoenergetic replacement of SFAs with
carbohydrates does not improve the serum total:HDL cholesterol.
All natural fats contain both SFAs, which do not change this ratio,
and unsaturated fatty acids, which lower it. As a result, even the
replacement of dairy fat and tropical fats with carbohydrates will

bohydrates constituting 1% of energy are replaced isoenergetically with

(18:0). *P < 0.001.

increase the ratio of total to HDL cholesterol (Figure 4). The
products with the most favorable effect on this ratio are oils that
are rich in cis unsaturated fatty acids, such as rapeseed, soy-
bean, sunflower, and olive oils. The effects of the PUFAs, which
in  our  analyses  consisted  mainly  of  linoleic  acid  plus  some
␣-linolenic acid, are more favorable than those of MUFAs such
as oleic acid, but the difference is slight. Our study did not
address the effects of n⫺3 PUFAs from fish. Their major effect
on  plasma  lipids  is  to  lower  triacylglycerols  (12), but  their
favorable effects on CAD mortality may also involve pathways
other than plasma lipoproteins (92).

Apolipoprotein B and LDL particle size

There is evidence that not only the amount of cholesterol trans-
ported by LDL particles but also the size and density of these par-
ticles and their apo B content affect CAD risk (93). Effects of car-
bohydrates on apo B were less favorable than those of unsaturated
fatty acids (Table 1), which may agree with the findings of stud-
ies in which high-carbohydrate diets not only increased triacyl-
glycerol concentrations but also induced a shift toward smaller,
denser LDL particles (93).

Individual saturated fatty acids

Lauric acid markedly increases cholesterol, whereas stearic
acid lowers it somewhat when it is used to replace carbohydrates.
However, the picture reverses if one looks at total:HDL choles-
terol: both lauric and stearic acid are now more favorable than car-
bohydrates. Lauric acid—a major component of tropical oils such
as coconut and palm kernel fat—has the largest cholesterol-rais-
ing effect of all fatty acids, but much of this is due to HDL cho-
lesterol. As a result, lauric acid had a more favorable effect on
total:HDL cholesterol than any other fatty acid, either saturated
or unsaturated.

trans Fatty acids

The  trans MUFAs  were  the  most  harmful  macronutrient  in
terms of the ratio of total to HDL cholesterol. If trans MUFAs
constituting 1% of energy are isoenergetically replaced with a
1:1:1 mix of carbohydrates, cis MUFAs, and cis PUFAs, then the

ratio decreases by 0.04. This is equivalent to replacing SFAs con-
stituting 1.8% of energy with such a mixture. If fat is replaced
exclusively with carbohydrates, then the difference becomes even
larger: isoenergetically replacing trans MUFAs constituting 1%
of energy with carbohydrates has the same effect on this ratio as
isoenergetically replacing SFAs constituting 7.3% of energy with
carbohydrates (Tables 1 and 3). The US diet provides, on average,
2.6% of energy from trans MUFAs and nearly 13% of energy from
SFAs (3), so that the total replacement of trans fatty acids in the
diet with carbohydrates would have a greater effect on total:HDL
cholesterol than would total replacement of SFAs. Therefore, even
low concentrations of trans MUFAs in the diet should deserve
attention as a target for efforts to lower CAD risk.

Consumption of trans fatty acids from partially hydro-
genated oils is associated with the risk of CAD in observational
studies. Unfortunately, the price, mouth-feel, and stability of
such hydrogenated oils make them a favorite of manufacturers
of fast foods (94). Palm oil is an acceptable alternative for the
industry, and, in terms of the effect on total:HDL cholesterol,
palm oil is still better than the partially hydrogenated vegetable
oils used in the food service industry. However, unhydro-
genated vegetable oils produce a much more favorable lipid
profile than do either palm oil or hydrogenated oils, and they
should be preferred.

The intake of trans fatty acids from ruminant fats including
milk and cheese shows a less consistent association with CAD
than does the intake of industrially hydrogenated fats. How-
ever, Oomen et al (95) found that the intakes of both ruminant
and industrially produced trans fatty acids predicted a higher
risk of CAD in the Zutphen Elderly Study. The intake of rumi-
nant trans fatty acids can be kept low by a choice of skimmed
dairy products and lean meat, in accordance with current
guidelines.

Low-fat, high-carbohydrate diets and body weight

The unfavorable effect of carbohydrates on total:HDL choles-
terol might be opposed by a favorable effect of carbohydrates on
body weight, because low-fat diets may promote weight reduction.

FIGURE 4. Predicted changes (⌬) in the ratio of serum total to HDL
cholesterol when mixed fat constituting 10% of energy in the “aver-
age” US diet is replaced isoenergetically with a particular fat or with
carbohydrates.

Isoenergetically replacing fat constituting 10% of energy with car-
bohydrates may reduce weight by 3 kg (96, 97). The data of Lee-
nen et al (98) suggest that a weight loss of 3 kg may lead to a
decrease of 0.24 in total:HDL cholesterol. If a high-carbohydrate
diet reduces energy intake sufficiently to cause a 3-kg weight loss,
then the effect on total:HDL cholesterol would be approximately
equal that of isoenergetic replacement of SFAs constituting 10%
of energy with cis unsaturated oils. This underlines the importance
of weight management in the reduction of CAD risk. Unfortu-
nately, the effects of low-fat diets on body weight over the long
term are uncertain (99). The introduction of low-fat, high-carbo-
hydrate foods in the United States does not appear to have reduced
caloric intake; rather, carbohydrates seem to have been added to
existing intakes. However, further studies on the long-term effect
of high-carbohydrate diets on body weight are urgently needed.

Thus, it is not certain whether weight loss per se is a strong
argument for replacing fat with carbohydrates. Without doubt,
reducing the high prevalence of obesity should be a major
public health target, but increased intakes of carbohydrates
could be shown to be insufficient to counter the effects of low
energy expenditure and high caloric intake that characterize
modern societies.

Dietary fat and other risk factors

High-fat diets lower fasting triacylglycerol concentrations, which
may reduce cardiovascular disease risk (85), but they also increase
postprandial concentrations of triacylglycerol-rich lipoproteins, which
are positively associated with CAD risk (100). In addition, the ele-
vated factor VII coagulant activity that occurs during the postpran-
dial phase of high-fat diets may predispose a person to coronary
thrombosis (101, 102). Whether a high-fat diet or a high-carbohydrate
diet changes insulin sensitivity or leads to the development of type 2
diabetes is still controversial (103). The ﬁnal answer as to the overall
effect of cis unsaturated fatty acids and carbohydrates on CAD risk
can only be decided by long-term controlled clinical trials. Clinical
trials have indeed shown that the replacement of SFAs and trans fatty
acids with polyunsaturated oils reduces the incidence of CAD (104).
The few trials that studied replacement of SFAs with carbohydrates

1152

MENSINK ET AL

were inconclusive (105, 106). Present trial data thus favor cis unsat-
urated fatty acids over carbohydrates.

Extrapolation to specific population groups and long-term
effects

The number of studies of hyperlipidemic subjects who met our
selection criteria was too limited for useful statistical analyses.
We cannot be sure, therefore, whether the predictive coefficients
for the effects of fatty acids will also apply to groups of patients
with hyperlipidemia. However, persons with high baseline cho-
lesterol  concentrations  are  probably  more  sensitive  to  dietary
changes than are persons with normal cholesterol concentrations
(107, 108). Therefore, we think that our coefficients are also appli-
cable  to  hyperlipidemic  patients.  If  anything, the  coefficients
would underestimate the effect in persons with higher cholesterol
concentrations, rather than overestimate it.

In one of our studies, we reported that the responses of total
and LDL cholesterol to SFAs were slightly larger in men than in
women (109). A sex effect could not be examined in the present
meta-analysis because too many studies did not report separate
data for men and women. Therefore, we may have slightly over-
estimated the effects of SFAs in women and underestimated those
in men, and this issue certainly deserves further attention.

The studies included in our meta-analysis lasted between 13
and 91 d. This raises the question of whether the effects observed
are transitory. However, long-term epidemiologic findings support
our findings. For example, a life-long high intake of carbohydrates
is associated with increased triacylglycerol concentrations (110),
whereas the effects on total cholesterol of fatty acids in observa-
tional studies also agree with the trials analyzed here (111). This
gives us conﬁdence that the effects seen in our present meta-analysis
are not transient.

Conclusions

The replacement of trans fatty acids with unsaturated fatty
acids from unhydrogenated oils is the single most effective meas-
ure for improving blood lipid profiles. Even small amounts of
unsaturated fatty acids have a major effect on the ratio of total to
HDL cholesterol. The efficacy of replacing SFAs with carbohy-
drates depends on the effects on body weight in the long term, and
that effect is uncertain.

Our results emphasize the risk of relying on cholesterol alone
as a marker of CAD risk. Replacement of carbohydrates with trop-
ical oils markedly raises total cholesterol, which is unfavorable,
but the picture changes if effects on HDL and apo B are taken into
account. The picture may change again once we know how to
interpret the effects of diet on postprandial lipemia, thrombogenic
factors, and other, newer markers. However, as long as informa-
tion directly linking the consumption of certain fats and oils with
CAD is lacking, we can never be sure what such fats and oils do
to CAD risk.

The situation is much clearer for replacement of SFAs with cis
unsaturated fatty acids. In that case, the effects on surrogate lipid
markers (Tables 1 and 2), the epidemiologic findings (89), and the
results of controlled clinical trials (104) all suggest that replace-
ment of SFAs with cis unsaturated fatty acids reduces CAD risk.
For trans fatty acids, the effect on lipid markers is strongly sup-
ported by prospective epidemiologic findings (95, 112). Studies
such as ours can predict the effects of fats on plasma lipids,
but  they  cannot  determine  whether  a  fat  will  cause  CAD.
Finally, it should be emphasized that our results may apply only

to populationwide issues of lipid management and not to individ-
ual patients, whereas total:HDL cholesterol may not be useful for
subjects with specific lipid abnormalities such as greatly decreased
HDL- or increased LDL-cholesterol concentrations. In fact, this is
true for any population-based study, and only a health care profes-
sional can ultimately determine the most appropriate (dietary)
advice for any person. However, the effect of carbohydrates on
total:HDL cholesterol justifies some caution in the application of
high-carbohydrate diets to the prevention of heart disease.

This study was planned, executed, and reported by RPM, PLZ, and MBK.
ADMK assisted with the statistical analysis and data interpretation. None of
the authors had any financial or personal conflict of interest.

Summary
Background High plasma HDL cholesterol is associated with reduced risk of myocardial infarction, but whether this 
association is causal is unclear. Exploiting the fact that genotypes are randomly assigned at meiosis, are independent 
of non-genetic confounding, and are unmodiﬁ ed by disease processes, mendelian random isation can be used to test 
the hypothesis that the association of a plasma biomarker with disease is causal.

Methods We performed two mendelian randomisation analyses. First, we used as an instrument a single nucleotide 
polymorphism  (SNP)  in  the  endothelial  lipase  gene  (LIPG  Asn396Ser)  and  tested  this  SNP  in  20  studies 
(20 913 myocardial infarction cases, 95 407 controls). Second, we used as an instrument a genetic score consisting of 
14  common  SNPs  that  exclusively  associate  with  HDL  cholesterol  and  tested  this  score  in  up  to  12 482  cases  of 
myocardial infarction and 41 331 controls. As a positive control, we also tested a genetic score of 13 common SNPs 
exclusively associated with LDL cholesterol.

Findings  Carriers  of  the  LIPG  396Ser  allele  (2·6%  frequency)  had  higher  HDL  cholesterol  (0·14  mmol/L  higher, 
p=8×10–¹³) but similar levels of other lipid and non-lipid risk factors for myocardial infarction compared with non-
carriers. This diﬀ erence in HDL cholesterol is expected to decrease risk of myocardial infarction by 13% (odds ratio 
[OR] 0·87, 95% CI 0·84–0·91). However, we noted that the 396Ser allele was not associated with risk of myocardial 
infarction  (OR  0·99,  95%  CI  0·88–1·11,  p=0·85).  From  observational  epidemiology,  an  increase  of  1  SD  in  HDL 
cholesterol was associated with reduced risk of myocardial infarction (OR 0·62, 95% CI 0·58–0·66). However, a 1 SD 
increase in HDL cholesterol due to genetic score was not associated with risk of myocardial infarction (OR 0·93, 
95% CI 0·68–1·26, p=0·63). For LDL cholesterol, the estimate from observational epidemiology (a 1 SD increase in 
LDL cholesterol associated with OR 1·54, 95% CI 1·45–1·63) was concordant with that from genetic score (OR 2·13, 
95% CI 1·69–2·69, p=2×10–¹⁰).

Interpretation Some genetic mechanisms that raise plasma HDL cholesterol do not seem to lower risk of myocardial 
infarction. These data challenge the concept that raising of plasma HDL cholesterol will uniformly translate into 
reductions in risk of myocardial infarction.

Introduction
Cholesterol fractions such as LDL and HDL cholesterol 
are among the most commonly measured biomarkers in 
clinical medicine.1 Observational studies have shown that 
LDL  and  HDL  cholesterol  have  opposing  associations 

with risk of myocardial infarction, with LDL cholesterol 
being  positively  associated  and  HDL  cholesterol  being 
inversely  associated.2,3  However,  observational  studies 
cannot  distinguish  between  a  causal  role 
in  the 
pathological  process  and  a  marker  of  the  underlying

patho physiology.  These  two  possibilities  can  be  distin-
guished in human beings by changes of the cholesterol 
fractions in large-scale randomised trials or by studies of 
inherited DNA variation. For LDL cholesterol, the results 
of  both  randomised  trials  of  LDL-cholesterol-lowering 
treatments4  and  from  human  mendelian  diseases5,6  are 
concordant  and  suggest  that  plasma  LDL  cholesterol  is 
causally related to risk of myocardial infarction. However, 
the  available  evidence  for  the  causal  relevance  of  HDL 
cholesterol from randomised trials or mendelian diseases 
is scarce and inconsistent.7,8

If  a  particular  plasma  biomarker  is  directly  involved 
in  an  underlying  pathological  process,  then  inherited 
variation  changing  plasma  concentrations  of  this  bio-
marker should aﬀ ect risk of disease in the direction and 
magnitude  predicted  by  the  plasma  concentrations. 
Referred  to  as  mendelian  randomisation,9–11  this  ana-
lytical  approach  has  been  previously  applied  to  plasma 
HDL  cholesterol,  albeit  with  restricted  sample  sizes, 
a  small  number  of  single  nucleotide  polymorphisms 
(SNPs) at a few genes, and with SNPs that aﬀ ect multiple 
lipid  fractions.8,12–15  Hence,  these  studies  have  not  been 
able  to  resolve  fully  the  possible  causal  relevance  of 
HDL  cholesterol  concentrations  for  risk  of  myocardial 
infarction.

Recently,  we  have  used  the  genome-wide  association 
approach  to  identify  SNPs  that  aﬀ ect  blood  lipid  con-
centrations.16,17  Additionally,  through  resequencing,  we 
identiﬁ ed a loss-of-function coding SNP at the endothelial 
lipase  gene  (LIPG  Asn396Ser)  that  aﬀ ects  plasma  HDL 
cholesterol  in  isolation.18,19  Here,  we  use  these  SNPs  in 
case-control studies and prospective cohort studies to test 
the  hypothesis  that  genetically  raised  plasma  HDL 
cholesterol might be protective for myocardial infarction.

Methods
Study design
The  study  design  consisted  of  two  components.  First, 
using  a  case-control  design,  we  tested  lipid-associated 
SNPs individually for association with risk of myocardial 
infarction.  Second,  using  a  mendelian  randomisation 
design, we tested two instruments: (1) a single SNP that 
related exclusively to plasma HDL cholesterol (a loss-of-
function coding polymorphism at the endothelial lipase 
gene,  LIPG  Asn396Ser,  rs61755018);  and  (2)  a  genetic 
score  consisting  of  14  common  SNPs  that  exclusively 
associate with HDL cholesterol.

non-fatal myocardial infarction. All participants were of 
self-reported European or South Asian ancestry.

Statistical analysis
In  myocardial  infarction  cases  and  controls,  we  tested 
each  of  25  SNPs  for  association  with  myocardial 
infarction  in  up  to  30  studies.  These  25  SNPs  repre-
sented  the  initial  polymorphisms  mapped  for  plasma 
HDL or LDL cholesterol concentrations with a genome-
wide association approach.16 Each selected SNP has been 
associated  with  either  HDL  or  LDL  cholesterol  at 
p<5×10–⁸. Genotyping details are provided in the appendix 
p 2. We undertook logistic regression with the outcome 
variable of myocardial infarction status, predictor variable 
of  individual  SNP  genotype,  and  covariates  of  age,  sex, 
and  principal  components  of  ancestry.  We  assumed  a 
log-additive  genetic  model.  Overall  association  for  each 
SNP was evaluated with a ﬁ xed-eﬀ ects inverse-variance-
weighted meta-analysis.

Fatal or non-fatal myocardial infarction outcomes were 
ascertained  in  each  of  six  prospective  cohort  studies  as 
described  in  the  appendix  p  10.  We  constructed  logistic 
regression  models  to  examine  the  association  of  LIPG 
Asn396Ser  genotype  with  myocardial  infarction  status, 
excluding participants who had had a previous myocardial 
infarc tion or ischaemic stroke. The predictor variable of 
LIPG  Asn396Ser  genotype  was  modelled  in  an  additive 
model (ie, 0, 1, 2 copies of the 396Ser allele). Covariates in 
the model included age and sex. Overall association for 
each SNP was evaluated across the six studies with ﬁ xed-
eﬀ ects inverse-variance-weighted meta-analysis.

We estimated a predicted risk for LIPG Asn396Ser on 
the  basis  of  the  association  of  this  SNP  with  plasma 
HDL cholesterol (appendix p 21) and the association of 
plasma  HDL  cholesterol  with  myocardial  infarction 
(appendix p 22) in the population. Details are provided in 
the appendix p 2.

We  undertook  instrumental  variable  analysis  using 
LIPG  Asn396Ser  in  six  prospective  cohort  studies  as 
listed  in  the  appendix  p  23.  We  additionally  did  an 
instrumental  variable  analysis  using  multiple  genetic 
variants  as  instruments.20  Details  of  the  instrumental 
variable analysis methods are provided in the appendix 
p  4.  We  regarded  a  two-tailed  p<0·05  as  nominally 
signiﬁ cant.  Heterogeneity  statistics  were  calculated  as 
described.21  SAS  version  9.1,  the  R  package,  STATA,  or 
PLINK software were used for all statistical analyses.22

case-control  studies  (table  1).  For  nine  of  ten  SNPs 
associated with LDL cholesterol, the allele correlated with 
increased  LDL  cholesterol  was  also  associated  with 
increased risk of myocardial infarction (p<0·05; table 1).
Having  established  that  SNPs  related  to  plasma  LDL 
cholesterol  consistently  aﬀ ected  risk  of  myocardial 

infarction,  we  applied  the  same  methodological  frame-
work  in  the  same  samples  to  test  the  hypothesis  that 
genetic modulation of HDL cholesterol would aﬀ ect risk 
of  myocardial  infarction.  Of  15  loci  related  to  plasma 
HDL cholesterol, at six loci (LPL, TRIB1, APOA1-APOC3-

myocardial  infarction  by  13%  (odds  ratio  [OR]  0·87, 
95% CI 0·84–0·91).

To establish whether LIPG 396Ser carriers are indeed 
protected from risk of myocardial infarction, we studied 
the  association  of  LIPG  Asn396Ser  with  incident 
myocardial  infarction  in  50 763  participants  from  six 
prospective cohort studies, the gold standard with respect 
to  epidemiological  study  design.  Of  these  participants, 
4228 developed a ﬁ rst myocardial infarction event. LIPG 
Asn396Ser was not associated with myocardial infarction 
in  any  of  the  six  studies  (ﬁ gure  2).  Combining  these 

the allele correlated with raised HDL cholesterol was also 
associated  with  decreased  risk  of  myocardial  infarction 
(p<0·05; table 2). Of note, at the HNF4A locus, the HDL-
cholesterol-raising allele was surprisingly associated with 
increased risk of myocardial infarction (p=0·0009).

example, 

All six SNPs associated with both HDL cholesterol and 
myocardial  infarction  had  additional  eﬀ ects  on  plasma 
LDL cholesterol or triglycerides, or both (p<5×10–⁸ for the 
additional  eﬀ ects  on  LDL  cholesterol  or  triglycer ides). 
For 
at  APOA1-APOC3-APOA4-APOA5 
rs6589566,  the  allele  associated  with  increased  HDL 
cholesterol  also  relates  to  reduced  LDL  cholesterol  and 
reduced  triglycerides.  The  pleiotropic  eﬀ ects  of  such 
SNPs  undermine  the  ability  to  deﬁ ne  a  causal  role  for 
HDL  cholesterol, 
independent  of  eﬀ ects  on  LDL 
cholesterol or triglycerides.

To  evaluate  plasma  HDL  cholesterol  speciﬁ cally, 
we  undertook  mendelian  randomisation,  a  form  of 
instrumental  variable  analysis.23  We  identiﬁ ed  a  variant 
that  aﬀ ected  only  plasma  HDL  cholesterol  without 
changing  other  lipid  or  non-lipid  cardiovascular  risk 
factors. In the LIPG gene, roughly 2·6% of individuals 
carry a serine substitution at aminoacid 396 (substituted 
for wild-type asparagine). Carrier status for 396Ser was 
associated with signiﬁ cant increases in HDL cholesterol 
in each of four prospective cohort studies, with the eﬀ ect 
size  ranging  from  0·08  mmol/L  to  0·28  mmol/L  per 
copy of the Ser allele (ﬁ gure 1, appendix p 21; p=0·002 in 
FHS, p=0·02 in CCHS, p=5×10–⁶ in MDC, and p=7×10–⁷ 
in ARIC).

In  a  meta-analysis  including  all  four  studies,  carrier 
status  for  396Ser  was  associated  with  an  increase  of 
roughly 0·29 SD units in HDL cholesterol (p=8×10–¹³). 
There was no evidence of heterogeneity across the four 
studies (I²=0·58; Cochran’s heterogeneity p=0·07). LIPG 
Asn396Ser  was  not  signiﬁ cantly  associated  with  other 
risk factors for myocardial infarction including plasma 
LDL  cholesterol,  triglycerides,  systolic  blood  pressure, 
body-mass index, risk of type 2 diabetes, fasting glucose, 
plasma C-reactive protein, waist-to-hip ratio, ﬁ brinogen, 
and small LDL particle concentration (p>0·05 for each; 
appendix  pp  24–26).  Therefore,  LIPG  Asn396Ser 
satisﬁ ed 
for  mendelian 
randomisation analysis—ie, that the genotype should be 
associated  with  an  intermediate  biomarker  (ﬁ gure  1), 
should  not  be  associated  with  confounding  factors 
(appendix pp 24–46), and should exert its eﬀ ect on the 
clinical outcome only through the speciﬁ c intermediate 
biomarker (appendix p 22).24

three  main  criteria 

the 

Under the model that plasma HDL cholesterol causally 
relates to risk of myocardial infarction, individuals with 
an  inherited  increase  in  HDL  cholesterol  (eg,  those 
carrying  the  LIPG  396Ser  allele)  are  expected  to  have 
reduced risk of myocardial infarction. On the basis of the 
associations  between  SNPs  and  HDL  cholesterol,  and 
HDL cholesterol and myocardial infarction, we estimated 
that  carriage  of  LIPG  396Ser  should  decrease  risk  of

studies  in  a  meta-analysis,  LIPG  Asn396Ser  allele  was 
not  associated  with  myocardial  infarction  (OR  1·10, 
95%  CI  0·89–1·37,  p=0·37;  ﬁ gure  2).  There  was  no 
evidence for heterogeneity across the six cohorts (I²=0·17; 
Cochran’s heterogeneity p=0·31).

We  also  studied  LIPG  Asn396Ser  in  case-control 
studies involving an additional 16 685 cases of myocardial 
infarction  and  48 872  controls  and  noted  that  this  SNP 
was not associated with myocardial infarction (OR 0·94, 
95%  CI  0·82–1·09,  p=0·41;  table  2,  ﬁ gure  2),  with  no 
evidence  of  heterogeneity  across  the  14  case-control 
studies 
(I²=0·34;  Cochran’s  heterogeneity  p=0·11). 
Finally, we used meta-analysis to combine the evidence 
from  both  the  prospective  studies  and  case-control 
studies (116 320 participants; 20 913 cases and 95 407 con-
trols).  In  all  available  samples,  LIPG  Asn396Ser 
remained  not  associated  with  risk  of  myocardial 
infarction  (OR  0·99,  95%  CI  0·88–1·11,  p=0·85; 
ﬁ gure 2). There was no evidence for heterogeneity across 
all 20 studies (I²=0·30; Cochran’s heterogeneity p=0·10).
We formally estimated the magnitude of an association 
of  genetically  raised  HDL  cholesterol  with  myocardial 
infarction,  using  LIPG  Asn396Ser  as  the  instrument. 
The  mendelian  randomisation  estimate  was  computed 
from  the  ratio  of  the  coeﬃ  cient  of  the  association 
between genotype and disease to that of the association 
between  genotype  and  plasma  HDL  cholesterol;  this 
instrumental  variable  estimate  reﬂ ects  the  potential 
causal  eﬀ ect  of  plasma  HDL  cholesterol  on  the  risk  of 
myocardial infarction.

Table 3 presents the instrumental variable estimate for 
the  association  of  plasma  HDL  cholesterol  with  risk  of 
myocardial  infarction  in  each  of  six  prospective  cohort 
studies.  In  each  study,  genetically  raised  plasma  HDL 
cholesterol  was  not  associated  with  risk  of  myocardial 
infarction.  In  meta-analysis,  genetically  raised  plasma 
HDL  cholesterol  was  also  not  associated  with  risk  of 
myocardial  infarction  (OR  1·02  per  0·03  mmol/L 

increase 

[1  mg/dL] 
in  HDL  cholesterol,  95%  CI 
0·95–1·09, p=0·64; OR 1·28 per 0·39 mmol/L [15 mg/dL] 
increase in HDL cholesterol, 95% CI 0·46–3·61, p=0·64).
Statistical  power  for  instrumental  variable  analysis 
could  be  increased  if  multiple  genetic  variants  in 
combination  are  used  as  instruments,  according  to  a 
recent  proposal.20  From  our  genome-wide  association 
study  of  plasma  lipid  traits  involving  more  than 
100 000  individuals,17  we  noted  that  13  common  SNPs 
had  statistical  evidence  at  genome-wide 
levels  of 
signiﬁ cance (p<5×10–⁸) for plasma LDL cholesterol and 
no  evidence  for  association  with  triglycerides  (p>0·01) 
or HDL cholesterol (p>0·01). We constructed a genetic 
score 
the  LDL-
cholesterol-raising  alleles  at  each  of  these  13  SNPs 
(appendix p 27).25 We also noted that 14 common SNPs 
had  statistical  evidence  at  genome-wide 
levels  of 
signiﬁ cance (p<5×10–⁸) for plasma HDL cholesterol and 
no  evidence  for  association  with  triglycerides  (p>0·01) 
or  LDL  cholesterol  (p>0·01).  We  constructed  a  genetic 
score  for  HDL  cholesterol  combining 
the  HDL-
cholesterol-raising  alleles  at  each  of  these  14  SNPs 
(appendix p 28). Each SNP was given a weight based on 
the  degree  of  change  in  LDL  or  HDL  cholesterol  as 
estimated in roughly 100 000 individuals.17

for  LDL  cholesterol  combining 

We  tested  the  association  of  genetic  scores  for  LDL 
and  HDL  cholesterol  separately  for  association  with 
myocardial infarction in up to 53 146 cases and controls 
from  the  CARDIoGRAM  study.26  From  observational 
epidemiology,  an  increase  of  1  SD  in  usual  LDL 
cholesterol was associated with raised risk of myocardial 
infarction (OR 1·54, 95% CI 1·45–1·63; appendix p 22). 
In a mendelian randomisation analysis, a 1 SD increase 
in  LDL  cholesterol  due  to  genetic  score  was  also 
associated  with  risk  of  myocardial  infarction  (OR  2·13, 
95% CI 1·69–2·69, p=2×10–¹⁰; table 4). From observational 
epidemiology, a 1 SD rise in usual HDL cholesterol was 
associated  with  lowered  risk  of  myocardial  infarction

Panel: Research in context

Systematic review
Electronic searches of Medline and PubMed, supplemented by 
hand searches of reference lists of other review articles, 
identiﬁ ed reports from three large mendelian randomisation 
studies for plasma HDL cholesterol.7,12,15 In each of these 
previous reports, genetically increased plasma HDL cholesterol 
was not associated with risk of ischaemic heart disease.

Interpretation
The present study tested a naturally occurring loss-of-
function variant in the endothelial lipase gene and, with this 
new instrument, we conﬁ rm that genetically raised plasma 
HDL cholesterol is not associated with risk of myocardial 
infarction. The study further extends previous work by testing 
an instrument consisting of 14 common variants exclusively 
associated with plasma HDL cholesterol. A genetic score 
consisting of these 14 variants was not associated with risk of 
myocardial infarction. These results show that some ways of 
raising HDL cholesterol might not reduce risk of myocardial 
infarction in human beings. Therefore, if an intervention such 
as a drug raises HDL cholesterol, we cannot automatically 
assume that risk of myocardial infarction will be reduced.

Inter vention  in  Metabolic  Syndrome  with  Low  HDL 
Cholesterol/High  Triglyceride  and  Impact  on  Global 
Health  Outcomes  (AIM-HIGH)  trial,31  the  addition  of 
long-acting  niacin  to  background  simvastatin  increased 
HDL  cholesterol  and  lowered  triglycerides  but  did  not 
lower risk of cardio vascular events.

Of note, at the cholesterol ester transfer protein (CETP) 
gene, we did ﬁ nd that common genetic variation reduces 
risk  of  myocardial  infarction  by  4%,  a  result  in  line 
with  an  earlier  meta-analysis.32  However,  the  CETP 
variant both increases HDL cholesterol and lowers LDL 
cholesterol17  in  a  manner  similar  to  pharmacological 
inhibitors  of  CETP.33  As  such,  whether  the  protection 
aﬀ orded  by  the  CETP  variant  is  due  to  the  change  in 
HDL or LDL cholesterol is diﬃ  cult to distinguish.

Third,  biomarkers  that  assay  HDL  function  might 
overcome some limitations of standard HDL cholesterol 
assays.  However,  a  challenge  will  remain—namely,  to 
prove  that  new  functional  HDL  biomarkers  reﬂ ect  a 
causal  association  with  myocardial  infarction  rather 
than  an  indirect  one,  as  seems  to  be  the  case  with 
plasma  HDL  cholesterol.  For  example,  using  a  new 
in-vitro  measure  involving  mouse  macrophages  and 
human  serum,  Khera  and  colleagues34  showed  an 
inverse  correlation  between  a  speciﬁ c  functional 
property of HDL, cholesterol eﬄ  ux capacity, and coro-
nary artery disease status. The present study suggests 
that a fruitful approach to the causal evaluation of such

in mendelian randomisation analysis, a 1 SD increase in 
HDL cholesterol due to genetic score was not associated 
with  risk  of  myocardial  infarction  (OR  0·93,  95%  CI

Discussion
For a biomarker directly involved in disease patho genesis, 
we expect a genetic variant that modulates the biomarker 
to  likewise  confer  risk  of  disease.  We  tested  this 
hypothesis  for  two  plasma  biomarkers:  LDL  and  HDL 
cholesterol.  SNPs  aﬀ ecting  LDL  cholesterol  were 
consistently  related  to  risk  of  myocardial  infarction. 
However, we unexpectedly found that LIPG Asn396Ser, a 
genetic variant that speciﬁ cally and substantially increases 
plasma HDL cholesterol, did not reduce risk of myocardial 
infarction.  A  genetic  score  combining  14  variants 
exclusively  related  to  HDL  cholesterol  also  showed  no 
association with risk of myocardial infarction (panel).

These  results  challenge  several  established  views 
about  plasma  HDL  cholesterol.  First,  these  data 
question  the  concept  that  raising  of  plasma  HDL 
cholesterol  should  uniformly  translate  into  reductions 
in  risk  of  myocardial  infarction.  We  raise  the  strong 
possibility  that  a  speciﬁ c  means  of  raising  of  HDL 
cholesterol  in  human  beings—namely,  inhibition  of 
endothelial  lipase—will  not  reduce  risk  of  myocardial 
infarction. In animal models, inhib ition or deletion of 
the  endothelial  lipase  gene  increases  HDL  cholesterol 
concentrations,27  but  there  has  been  debate  as  to  the 
consequent  eﬀ ect  on  atherosclerosis.  One  report 
suggested  that  mice  deleted  for  Lipg  on  an  Apoe 
knockout  genetic  background  have  decreased  aortic 
atherosclerosis,28  but  a  subsequent  study  showed  no 
eﬀ ect of Lipg deletion on aortic atherosclerosis.29

Second,  these  ﬁ ndings  emphasise  the  potential  limi-
tation of plasma HDL cholesterol as a surrogate measure 
for  risk  of  myocardial  infarction  in  intervention  trials. 
The data presented here using mendelian randomisation 
are  consistent  with  results  from  completed  random-
ised  controlled  trials  focused  on  raising  plasma  HDL

functional measures in human beings might be large-
scale study of relevant inherited DNA variation of HDL 
function.

There  are  inherent  limitations  to  the  mendelian  ran-
domisation  study  design.  Naturally  occurring  genetic 
variation could be a useful instrument to assess causality 
provided that several requirements have been satisﬁ ed.35,36 
First, one needs suitable genetic variants for the study of 
the modiﬁ able exposure of interest (in our case, plasma 
HDL  cholesterol).  Although  many  loci  are  associated 
with plasma HDL cholesterol, we found LIPG Asn396Ser 
to  be  particularly  informative  because  it  is  speciﬁ cally 
associated with substantial increases in HDL cholesterol. 
Additionally,  we  evaluated  a  set  of  14  common  genetic 
variants  that  also  exclusively  aﬀ ected  HDL  cholesterol. 
Both  instruments,  LIPG  Asn396Ser  and  the  genetic 
score, produced similar results.

Second,  reliable  genotype-to-intermediate-phenotype 
and  intermediate-phenotype-to-disease  eﬀ ect  estimates 
are needed. To obtain as precise estimates as possible, we 
derived SNP-to-lipid eﬀ ect estimates from analysis of a 
large  sample  involving  more  than  24 000  participants. 
Estimates of plasma lipid to myocardial infarction were 
derived from meta-analysis of four large cohort studies 
involving more than 25 000 participants.

Third,  there  must  not  be  pleiotropic  eﬀ ects  of 
the  genetic  variants  of  interest.  We  cannot  exclude  all 
potential pleiotropic eﬀ ects of the LIPG Asn396Ser SNP; 
however, we have assessed but did not detect pleiotropic 
eﬀ ects  on  other  cardiovascular  risk  factors  including 
LDL  cholesterol,  small  LDL  particle  concentration,  tri-
glycerides,  body-mass  index,  systolic  blood  pressure, 
plasma C-reactive protein, and type 2 diabetes status.

Finally, the absence of association of individual SNPs 
with myocardial infarction could be due to low statistical 
power.  However,  for  the  crucial  SNP  in  the  mendelian 
randomisation  study  for  plasma  HDL  cholesterol,  we 
had suﬃ  cient power. In this study, LIPG Asn396Ser has 
been  tested  in  20 913  myocardial  infarction  cases  and 
95 407  myocardial-infarction-free  participants.  We  had 
90% power to detect the expected 13% reduction in risk 
of myocardial infarction for the LIPG Asn396Ser variant 
(at a two-sided α of 0·05).

In summary, our results showed that polymorphisms 
related  to  plasma  LDL  cholesterol  were  consistently 
associated  with  risk  of  myocardial  infarction,  whereas 
this was not the case for variants related to plasma HDL 
cholesterol.  A  polymorphism  in  the  endothelial  lipase 
gene  and  a  genetic  score  of  14  common  SNPs  that 
speciﬁ cally raised HDL cholesterol were not associated 
with  myocardial  infarction,  suggesting  that  some 
genetic mechanisms that raise HDL cholesterol do not 
lower  risk  of  myocardial  infarction.  Hence,  inter-
ventions (lifestyle or pharmacological) that raise plasma 
HDL cholesterol cannot be assumed ipso facto to lead 
to  a  corresponding  beneﬁ t  with  respect  to  risk  of 
myocardial infarction.

Abstract
Objective To review systematically the evidence for an effect of
long chain and shorter chain omega 3 fatty acids on total
mortality, cardiovascular events, and cancer.
Data sources Electronic databases searched to February 2002;
authors contacted and bibliographies of randomised controlled
trials (RCTs) checked to locate studies.
Review methods Review of RCTs of omega 3 intake for ≥ 6
months in adults (with or without risk factors for cardiovascular
disease) with data on a relevant outcome. Cohort studies that
estimated omega 3 intake and related this to clinical outcome
during at least 6 months were also included. Application of
inclusion criteria, data extraction, and quality assessments were
performed independently in duplicate.
Results Of 15 159 titles and abstracts assessed, 48 RCTs
(36 913 participants) and 41 cohort studies were analysed. The
trial results were inconsistent. The pooled estimate showed no
strong evidence of reduced risk of total mortality (relative risk
0.87, 95% confidence interval 0.73 to 1.03) or combined
cardiovascular events (0.95, 0.82 to 1.12) in participants taking
additional omega 3 fats. The few studies at low risk of bias were
more consistent, but they showed no effect of omega 3 on total
mortality (0.98, 0.70 to 1.36) or cardiovascular events (1.09, 0.87
to 1.37). When data from the subgroup of studies of long chain
omega 3 fats were analysed separately, total mortality (0.86, 0.70
to 1.04; 138 events) and cardiovascular events (0.93, 0.79 to
1.11) were not clearly reduced. Neither RCTs nor cohort studies
suggested increased risk of cancer with a higher intake of
omega 3 (trials: 1.07, 0.88 to 1.30; cohort studies: 1.02, 0.87 to
1.19), but clinically important harm could not be excluded.
Conclusion Long chain and shorter chain omega 3 fats do not
have a clear effect on total mortality, combined cardiovascular
events, or cancer.

Introduction
Consumption of long chain omega 3 fatty acids (eicosapentae-
noic acid (EPA), docosapentaenoic acid (DPA), and docosahexae-
noic acid (DHA)) found in fatty fish and fish oils has been linked
to the low incidence of coronary heart disease in the Inuit peo-
ple of Greenland1; ♡ linolenic acid (ALA), a shorter chain omega
3 found in some plant oils (and variably converted to eicosapen-
taenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid) may also be protective.2
Omega 3 fats may protect against cardiovascular disease by low-
ering blood pressure
reducing serum
triglycerides, thrombotic tendency, inflammation, and arrhyth-

and heart

rate;

mias; and improving endothelial function, insulin sensitivity,
paraoxonase concentrations, and plaque stability.3–6

fat

Toxic compounds, such as

soluble methylmercury,
dioxins, and polychlorinated biphenyls, are also found in oily fish
and fish oils, but any harm from these compounds would be seen
only after long term supplementation.7 8 Animal intervention
studies and studies of adults after severe inadvertent exposure
indicate that dioxins and polychlorinated biphenyls increase the
risk of cancer.9 10 Methylmercury may increase the risk of
myocardial infarction and cause neurological damage.11 12

Since a meta-analysis of the effect of omega 3 fats on cardio-
vascular morbidity and mortality in coronary heart disease sug-
gested important benefits,13 a large intervention study has been
published.14 Our meta-analysis
included these new data,
balanced protective effects with possible harm, assessed the
effects of plant based omega 3 fats on health, included people
without established cardiovascular disease, and highlighted
important questions about the role of omega 3 fats on cardiovas-
cular disease and mortality. We systematically reviewed the
effects of long chain and short chain omega 3 fats (together and
separately) on mortality, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and
bleeding events and analysed all relevant randomised controlled
trials (RCTs) and prospective cohort studies.

Methods
The study methods have been described in detail elsewhere.15
Search strategy and study selection
the
We searched the Cochrane Library, Medline, Embase,
National Research Register, and SIGLE (to February 2002); we
checked the bibliographies of included studies and contacted the
authors. Articles not in English were translated. We excluded tri-
als if they were not randomised; they had no omega 3 arm; the
participants were children or were critically ill; the duration was
< 6 months; the intervention was multifactorial; or data on
death, cardiovascular disease, or cancer were not available. We
rejected cohort studies if they did not assess the intake of omega
3, follow-up was < 6 months, or the association between the
intake of omega 3 and health was not investigated. Two reviewers
assessed the inclusion of articles
independently, and we
contacted authors for more information on methodological
quality, outcomes, and further studies.

Data extraction and quality assessment
Two reviewers independently extracted the data and assessed the
quality of the studies. For RCTs we assessed the following quality
characteristics: concealment of allocation to the study arms and
the masking of participants, providers, and outcome assessors. We
classed trials as having low risk of bias if allocation to the study
arms was concealed and participants, providers, and outcome
assessors were masked. Quality assessment of cohort studies was
based on control group type, number lost to follow-up, baseline
similarity, adjustment for dissimilarities, and masking.

Data synthesis
For RCTs we extracted the numbers of participants experiencing
each outcome and total numbers randomised for each study
arm, and combined by using relative risks in random effects
meta-analysis.16 For cohort studies we used relative risk or odds
ratio that had been adjusted for the most confounding factors,
and we compared the most exposed quantile with the least
exposed quantile. We used one analysis only for each cohort per
outcome.

We used subgrouping of RCTs to explore the effects on mor-
tality, cardiovascular events, and cancer of long chain versus
short chain omega 3 fats and dietary advice versus supplementa-
tion. We used random effects meta-regression to analyse the
effects of the dose of omega 3 and the duration of the trial. Sen-
sitivity analyses assessed the robustness of RCT results to trial
quality by restricting the analysis to studies with low risk of bias.

Allocation concealment was coded as done, unclear, or not done; blinding of participants, providers, and outcome assessors was coded as yes (where there was a clear and realistic attempt to
blind—success of blinding was rarely checked in the studies), unclear, or no (in consultation with authors of trials where possible).
A trial was considered to be at low risk of bias if allocation concealment was “done” and blinding of participants, providers, and outcome assessors was coded “yes.” All other trials were
considered at moderate or high risk of bias.

cohort studies fulfilled all inclusion criteria (fig 1; for a complete
set of references see bmj.com). Table 1 shows the main
characteristics of the included studies.

Intervention or exposure
Dietary supplements were given in 44 trials (36 as capsules, six as
oil, one each as liquid emulsion and enriched margarine), advice
on eating oily fish in three, and advice on diet and food supple-
ments in one. Supplements were long chain omega 3 fats

(usually whole or concentrated fish oil; one small trial used
refined eicosapentaenoic acid and one used refined docosahex-
aenoic acid), and five studies provided shorter chain omega 3
fats. Doses of long chain omega 3 fats (summing eicosapentae-
noic acid, docosahexaenoic acid, and docosapentaenoic acid)
varied from 0.4 g to 7.0 g per day. Control groups received veg-
etable oils, other fats, “inert” or ill defined substances, different
dietary advice, or nothing. The intervention lasted 6-11 months

in 23 studies, 12-23 months in 16, 24-47 months in eight, and
≥ 48 months in one study.

Intake of omega 3 (varying combinations of eicosapentae-
noic acid, docosahexaenoic acid, docosapentaenoic acid, along
with ♡ linolenic acid, supplemental fish oils, or dietary oily fish)
was assessed by dietary and biochemical means in two cohorts,
dietary means only in 18, and biochemical means only in 10.
Groups with the lowest and highest intake of long chain omega
3 differed by 0.1-0.6 g omega 3 per day.

Methodological quality
Twenty five RCTs were rated as having a low risk of bias (table 2).
Losses to follow-up were unclear in 16 cohort studies. In 15
cohort studies the outcome assessors were blinded to exposure,
in two they were not blinded, and in nine blinding was unclear.

In the seven cohort studies that described omega 3 intake at
baseline (five assessed long chain omega 3 fats only, one short
chain omega 3 fats only, and one assessed both), the characteris-
tics of participants with high and low intake of omega 3 fats dif-
fered. People who consumed most long chain omega 3 at
baseline had an advantage with regard to lifestyle (smoking, diet,
and exercise), interest in health, and social factors (education, liv-
ing in town). Adjustment for these potential confounding factors
may not have been adequate (table 3).

Total mortality
Deaths occurred in 15 RCTs (1995 deaths), and authors of 29
RCTs reported that no deaths occurred. Evidence that risk of
death was reduced in participants randomised to omega 3 (rela-

tive risk 0.87, 95% confidence interval 0.73 to 1.03) was weak, and
inconsistency was moderate (I2 = 42%) (fig 2). When analysis was
restricted to studies at low risk of bias this effect was attenuated
(0.98, 0.70 to 1.36; 138 deaths), and inconsistency between RCTs
was low (I2 = 0%). This sensitivity analysis removed the RCT by
Singh, whose studies have been questioned.18

Results were similar for long chain versus short chain omega
3 (fig 2) and dietary advice versus supplements (data not shown).
Meta-regression indicated that the risk of death increased as the
length of the RCT increased (regression coefficient 0.008, 0.003
to 0.012). This is compatible with omega 3 fats having an early
protective effect
the
association was lost when we removed the large trial by Burr et
al.14 Meta-regression did not suggest a relation between mortality
and the dose of long chain omega 3. Cohort studies suggested
that omega 3 protected against death (0.65, 0.48 to 0.88;
I2 = 36%), but it was unclear whether adjustment for confounders
was adequate.

that

Combined cardiovascular events
Eighteen RCTs provided data on cardiovascular events in 2628
participants. The meta-analysis showed no definite effect of
omega 3 fats on cardiovascular events, but confidence intervals
were wide (0.95, 0.82 to 1.12) and inconsistency was high
(I2 = 65%) (fig 3). Removing studies at moderate or high risk of
bias reduced but did not remove inconsistency (1.09, 0.87 to
1.37; 570 events; I2 = 49%).

Subgrouping by long chain versus short chain omega 3 or by
advice to eat oily fish versus supplements did not generate robust
effects of omega 3 fats on cardiovascular events. Cohort studies
provided no strong evidence that omega 3 fats protect against
cardiovascular events.

Cancer
Ten RCTs reported the incidence of cancer; 391 diagnoses of
cancer or death from cancer occurred in 17 433 participants
(two of the trials reported no cancers). We found no evidence
that omega 3 fats had an effect on the incidence of cancer (1.07,
0.88 to 1.30) and there was no inconsistency (I2 = 0%) (fig 4). Five
trials and seven events remained on sensitivity analysis.

Seven cohort studies provided data on cancer (832 events in
the highest and lowest quantiles), and meta-analysis found no
effect of high versus low intake of omega 3 (1.02, 0.87 to 1.19;
I2 = 21%).

Outcomes related to bleeding
Nine RCTs reported at least one stroke (243 strokes in total), but
little information was available specifically on haemorrhagic
stroke. Omega 3 had no clear effect on the total numbers of
strokes (1.17, 0.91 to 1.51; I2 = 0%), in sensitivity analysis (29
events), or in four cohort studies (0.87, 0.72 to 1.04) (fig 5).

Discussion
Our meta-analysis of RCTs assessing the effects of increased
omega 3 fats on total mortality found substantial variations
between studies. Studies with stronger methodology had more
consistent results, and the pooled relative risk of these studies
was 0.98 (0.70 to 1.36; 138 events). We found no evidence from
RCTs or cohort studies that omega 3 fats have an effect on com-
bined cardiovascular events. Neither RCTs nor cohort studies
showed significantly increased risks of cancer or stroke with
higher intake of omega 3, but there were too few events to rule

Note: Borchgrevink 1966, Natvig 1968, and 120 participants from Singh 1997 received short chain (not long chain) omega 3 fats.
Trials of long chain omega 3 fats only had a pooled relative risk of cardiovascular events of 0.93 (95% CI 0.79 to 1.11), and trials of short chain omega 3 only
had a pooled relative risk of 0.92 (0.58 to 1.45)

Strengths and weaknesses
The largest studies reviewed had greater potential for bias than
some of the smaller ones. We hoped that pooling studies at low
risk of bias might provide enough power to inform us of effects
on health, but this was not the case (only 138 deaths and 570
cardiovascular events). Similarly, analysis of the effects of omega
3 on rarer outcomes such as stroke had insufficient power to
detect clinically important effects. Unlike previous meta-
analyses, we reviewed systematically the effects of omega 3 fats
on mortality, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and bleeding events
and analysed all relevant RCTs and prospective cohort studies.
We also accounted for differences in study quality and examined
the effects of long chain and short chain omega 3 fats in a wide

group of participants; this provides high quality evidence to
guide policy and practice.

Other studies
Our findings differ from those of a recent systematic review by
Bucher et al,13 which reviewed trials assessing the effects of long
chain omega 3 fats over at least six months in patients with coro-
nary heart disease and found significant protection from mortal-
ity (0.8, 0.7 to 0.9) and sudden death (0.7, 0.6 to 0.9). Bucher et al
analysed 11 RCTs (nine included here, two excluded as multifac-
torial interventions) with 15 806 participants and 1335 deaths
but did not include the recent study by Burr et al with 3114 par-
ticipants included in our study.14

disease mentioned only four large trials and did not pool the
results.20

Our inclusion of studies with short chain omega 3 as the
active intervention or with participants who had a lower risk of
cardiovascular disease does not explain the differences between
our results and those of Bucher et al. When we pooled studies in
which participants were given only long chain omega 3 fats or
were at high risk of cardiovascular disease the risk of death was
not significantly reduced. However, when we removed the study
by Burr et al from our meta-analysis, risk of death was similar to
that reported by Bucher et al (0.83, 0.75 to 0.91). The study by
Burr et al (included in our review as an unpublished study, since
published) is the second largest study in terms of deaths reported
(525 deaths; the GISSI-P study reports 1031 deaths).21

Why does the study by Burr et al contradict the other large
studies by not suggesting a benefit of omega 3?14 The first possi-
ble explanation is that this RCT had the longest follow-up of all
RCTs and the harmful effects of methylmercury could be cumu-
lative. Time course analysis of the GISSI-P trial was consistent
with the risk of death rising over the 42 months of the trial, but
the increase in mortality was seen within the first year in the
study by Burr et al.14 22 A second explanation is that the study by
Burr et al was the only RCT that specifically enrolled men
treated for angina. Post hoc subgroup analysis of the GISSI-P
trial indicates that people with heart failure benefited most from
omega 3 supplements (R Marchioli, personal communication,
2004). As heart failure is more common after myocardial infarc-
tion this may explain an attenuation of effect but would not
explain the increase in risk suggested in the study by Burr et al. A
third possibility is that omega 3 from oily fish has a different
effect to fish oil supplements, but this was investigated by Burr et
al and found not to explain the differences. It is therefore not
clear why the results of Burr et al differ from the other large
studies on fish based omega 3. It is possible that performance
bias due to differential care in the intervention and control arms
occurred in trials where the intervention was not masked, includ-
ing GISSI-P and the Burr study,14 21 23 but dietary intake, other
relevant risk factors, and pharmacotherapy appeared similar in
both arms of these trials. It may be that the effect of omega 3 fats
on cardiovascular disease is smaller than previously thought, or
that its beneficial effect is limited to a specific group (such as
patients after myocardial infarction or with heart failure) not
represented in the study by Burr et al.14

Cohort studies or RCTs?
A recent meta-analysis assessed the effects of consumption of
fish on stroke in cohort studies and found that people who ate
white or oily fish at least once a week had a significantly reduced
risk of stroke.24 We excluded cohort studies that assessed only
total fish intake (as this is not clearly related to omega 3 intake).
The web of lifestyle, interest in health, and social factors (health
patterning) seen in the cohort studies included in our review
provides an advantage to people taking most long chain omega
3 fats, and this makes adequate adjustment for confounding dif-
ficult, if not impossible. Thus, we must rely on high quality RCTs
to provide non-confounded answers about the effects of omega
3 fats on health. Some effects of fish on health may be due to
components other than omega 3—for example, selenium or vita-
min D.

Interpretation
It is not clear whether long chain or short chain omega 3 fats
(together or separately) reduce or increase total mortality,
cardiovascular events, cancer, or strokes. Our findings do not rule
out an important effect of omega 3 fats on total mortality, as

What is already known on this topic

A systematic review of randomised controlled trials in
coronary heart disease showed reduced mortality in
patients taking supplemental long chain omega 3 fats
What this study adds

This systematic review assessed the health effects of long
chain and shorter chain omega 3 fats (together or
separately) on total mortality, cardiovascular events, cancer,
and strokes in a wide group of participants and found no
evidence of a clear benefit of omega 3 fats on health

robust trials at low risk of bias reported few deaths. There is no
evidence that the source (dietary or supplemental) and dose of
omega 3 fats affected the effectiveness of long chain omega 3
fats.

UK guidelines encourage the general public to eat more oily
fish, and higher amounts are advised after myocardial infarction
(supported by trials after myocardial infarction).20 25 26 This advice
should continue at present but the evidence should be reviewed
regularly. It is probably not appropriate to recommend a high
intake of omega 3 fats for people who have angina but have not
had a myocardial infarction.

Adjustment for lifestyle factors appeared to be inadequate in
the cohort studies, so policy and lifestyle decisions should be
based on data from RCTs. To understand the effects of omega 3
fats on health, we need more high quality RCTs (with adequate
concealment of allocation and masking of participants and
health providers) of long duration that also report the associated
harms.

Abstract

Greater ﬁsh oil consumption has been associated with reduced CVD risk, although the mechanisms are unclear. Plant-source oil omega-3
fatty acids (ALA) have also been studied regarding their cardiovascular effect. We conducted a systematic review of randomized controlled
trials that evaluated the effect of consumption of ﬁsh oil and ALA on commonly measured serum CVD risk factors, performing meta-analyses
when appropriate. Combining 21 trials evaluating lipid outcomes, ﬁsh oil consumption resulted in a summary net change in triglycerides of
−27 (95% CI −33, −20) mg/dL, in HDL cholesterol of +1.6 (95% CI +0.8, +2.3) mg/dL, and in LDL cholesterol of +6 (95% CI +3, +8) mg/dL.
There was no effect of ﬁsh oil on total cholesterol. Across studies, higher ﬁsh oil dose and higher baseline levels were associated with greater
reductions in serum triglycerides. Overall, the 27 ﬁsh oil trials evaluating Hgb A1c or FBS found small non-signiﬁcant net increases compared
to control oils. Five studies of ALA were inconsistent in their effects on lipids, Hgb A1c or FBS. Four studies investigating the effects of
omega-3 fatty acids on hs-CRP were also inconsistent and non-signiﬁcant. The evidence supports a dose-dependent beneﬁcial effect of ﬁsh oil
on serum triglycerides, particularly among people with more elevated levels. Fish oil consumption also modestly improves HDL cholesterol,
increases LDL cholesterol levels, but does not appear to adversely affect glucose homeostasis. The evidence regarding the effects of omega-3
fatty acids on hs-CRP is inconclusive, as are data on ALA.

1. Background

2. Methods

The relationship between dietary omega-3 fatty acids
and risk of developing CVD began to emerge in the late
1970s [1–3]. Thereafter, a limited number of intervention
trials reported lower rates of CVD mortality and sudden
death, but not stroke, after supplementation with the long-
chain omega-3 fatty acids EPA or DHA; however,
the
data on the shorter-chain omega-3 fatty acid ALA are far
less certain [4]. Potential mechanisms for the cardioprotec-
tive effect of omega-3 fatty acids include anti-arrhythmic
effects, anti-thrombotic effects, anti-inﬂammatory effects,
lowered blood pressure,
improved endothelial function,
hypotriglyceridemic effects in hypertriglyceridemic indi-
viduals and retarded growth of atherosclerotic plaque
[5,6].

EPA and DHA are commonly referred to as very long
chain omega-3 fatty acids. The primary sources in the diet
of humans are ﬁsh, especially dark ﬂeshed ﬁsh, and, if con-
sumed, ﬁsh oil supplements. ALA is a plant form of omega-3
fatty acid. The major dietary sources in the human diet are
soybean and canola oils. In addition, the amounts in ﬂaxseeds
and walnuts and their respective oils are high and when
consumed can provide relatively high levels of intake. The
rate of conversion by humans of ALA to EPA is low, with
estimates ranging from 0.2% to 15%, as is the conversion
of EPA to DHA [7]. However, high intakes of ALA have
been reported to result in signiﬁcant increases in very long
chain omega-3 fatty acids in various body compartments
[8,9].

To better understand how both ﬁsh oil (and dietary ﬁsh)
and ALA consumption exert their effects on clinical CVD,
we systematically reviewed the literature on various car-
diovascular disease risk factors and intermediate markers
[10]. We have previously reported on coronary restenosis,
intima-media thickness, and exercise tolerance [11]. Here we
report on serum markers of CVD risk, including blood lipid
and lipoprotein levels (total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol,
HDL cholesterol, triglyceride), a measure of inﬂammation
(CRP) and measures of glucose homeostasis (FBS and Hgb
A1c).

2.1. Literature search and eligibility criteria

Details of the systematic review and statistical methods
have been reported [11]. Brieﬂy, we conducted a system-
atic review of the English-language literature on omega-3
fatty acids and cardiovascular disease in Medline, Embase,
Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Biolog-
ical Abstracts, and Commonwealth Agricultural Bureau
databases through April 2003. Search terms included the
speciﬁc omega-3 fatty acids, ﬁsh and other marine oils, and
omega-3 fatty acid-rich plant oils. We also reviewed addi-
tional publications found by domain experts.

We evaluated randomized controlled trials of omega-3
fatty acid interventions, as either supplements or dietary com-
ponents. The omega-3 fatty acids of particular interest with
respect to cardiovascular disease include EPA, DHA, and
ALA. To qualify, studies could include only subjects who
were either generally healthy; had diabetes, hypertension, or
dyslipidemia; or had cardiovascular disease. We excluded
studies of omega-3 fatty acid supplementation of >6 g/day or
of <4 weeks’ duration, and studies that did not quantify fatty
acid supplementation or ﬁsh amounts.

A large number of studies met the minimum eligibility
criteria for the various CVD outcomes we investigated (327
articles), we therefore limited eligibility of studies of lipids,
FBS and Hgb A1c to the larger randomized trials, as summa-
rized in Table 1. We determined minimum study size based
on a goal of approximately 20 studies per outcome analyzed.
We accepted all studies of CRP.

2.2. Quantitative analysis

For analysis, we evaluated the relative change of the out-
come compared to placebo – the net difference between the
within-treatment effect and the within-placebo effect. For
ﬁsh oil studies (including dietary ﬁsh) of lipids and glucose
homeostasis we performed meta-analysis with the DerSi-
monian and Laird random effects model, which assigns a
weight to each study that is based on both the within study

variance and the between-study heterogeneity [12]. When
necessary, we estimated the standard error of the net change
from reported variance data. We contacted authors for addi-
tional data when variance data were missing. For two stud-
ies, we made conservative estimates of variance data from
other sources, as described in the legend to Fig. 1. Stud-
ies of ﬁsh oil (or dietary ﬁsh) and of ALA were analyzed
separately.

We also performed multivariate linear regression analy-
ses (meta-regression) to evaluate the effect of ﬁsh oil. In
meta-regression, each data point represents the mean effect
from each study, instead of data from an individual as in tra-
ditional regression. We used the random-effects regression
model described by Berkey et al. and Morris [13,14]. We
evaluated the effects of ﬁsh oil dose, baseline value, study
duration, change of outcome value in the control group, and
study quality (using dummy variables) on net change levels.

2.3. Quality and applicability assessment

All randomized trials were assessed for both study quality
and applicability. Methodological quality refers to the design,
conduct, and reporting of the clinical study. Because studies
with a variety of design types were evaluated, a three-level
classiﬁcation of study quality and applicability was used as
described previously [15]. The quality and applicability clas-
siﬁcations, along with the target populations, are described
in Table 2.

3. Results

The literature search for all studies of omega-3 fatty acids
and cardiovascular disease related conditions yielded 7464
citations. We retrieved and reviewed 807 articles to analyze
cardiovascular events, risk factors or intermediate markers.
Of these we analyzed 123 articles that reported about 23
different cardiovascular disease risk factors and interme-
diate markers. Here, we discuss the 52 randomized con-
trolled trials that reported data on the effect of omega-3 fatty
acid consumption on the predetermined serum markers of
CVD risk.

3.1. Characteristics of all evaluated studies

Fish or other marine oils (EPA and DHA as supplements,
dietary ﬁsh, or oil spreads) were evaluated by 47 of 52 studies;
whereas, six evaluated plant oils (ALA as supplements, veg-
etable oils, nuts or oil spreads), one of which also evaluated
ﬁsh oil. EPA + DHA doses ranged from 0.045 to 5.9 g/day,
ﬁsh diets ranged from 0.9 to 3.8 servings per week, ALA
doses ranged from 1.8 g to about 5 g/day. No study examined
possible correlations between the effect of omega-3 fatty acid
consumption on serum markers and the effect on clinical or
cardiovascular disease.

3.2. Lipid proﬁle

We reviewed the 25 largest randomized trials that con-
tained data on omega-3 fatty acid intake and plasma lipids
(Table 2) [16–40]. Nineteen studies evaluated ﬁsh oil, three
ﬁsh (or Mediterranean) diets, one various combinations of
ﬁsh oil and diet, and three plant oils. These studies repre-
sented about 8000 subjects. Approximately, two-thirds of the
subjects were included in the GISSI study of ﬁsh oil supple-
ments [34]. The studies were generally of fair quality, with
moderate to broad applicability.

3.2.1. Fish and ﬁsh oil

Twenty-one studies included 37 individual study arms of
ﬁsh oil or ﬁsh diet that evaluated any of the lipid proﬁle com-
ponents (Fig. 1 and Table 2) [16–36]. For all four-lipid pro-
ﬁle components, studies were heterogeneous in their results
(P < 0.0001) with wide ranges of net effects—from 6% to
60% net improvements to 6–14% net worsening. However,
in the majority of studies, the net effects on total, LDL, and
HDL cholesterol levels were small (<5%). In contrast, most
studies of triglycerides found at least a 15% net reduction
with ﬁsh oil consumption.

Across the studies, random effects model meta-analyses
found a signiﬁcant net improvement of triglycerides with ﬁsh
oil consumption of −27 (95% CI −33, −20) mg/dL, and of
HDL cholesterol of +1.6 (95% CI +0.8, +2.3) mg/dL, and a
signiﬁcant net worsening of LDL cholesterol of +6 (95% CI
+3, +8) mg/dL. There was no effect on total cholesterol. The

Fig. 1. Meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials of the effect of ﬁsh oil on lipid values. The point estimates of the net changes (change in ﬁsh oil arm
minus change in control arm) and the corresponding 95% CI for individual studies are indicated by circles and bars. The random effects model summary
results are indicated by squares and bars near the bottom. Studies are arranged by dose of ﬁsh oil. Source of omega-3 fatty acid (n-3)− D = DHA, E = EPA,
ED = EPA + DHA, F = Fish, number of subjects consuming ﬁsh oil (N), duration, study quality and applicability (see Table 2), and baseline values for each
lipid are shown. For individual studies, black circles indicate that data came from text or tables; open circles indicate that data were estimated from graphs;
thick solid 95% CI indicates that the standard error (S.E.) of the net change was reported; thin solid 95% CI indicates that S.E. of net change estimated from
either baseline and ﬁnal S.E.s or S.E.s of cohort changes; dashed 95% CI indicates that S.E. of net change estimated from other sources. For Cairns [16], no
S.E. data were provided, so the standard deviations (S.D.) were assumed to be the same as the largest S.D.s among the other studies. For Nilsen [21], S.E. for
triglycerides was estimated based on S.D. for full sample of 120 subjects, and S.E. for total cholesterol was assumed to be the same as the S.E. of the baseline
data. (*) N = 119 for HDL and 75 for total cholesterol. (†) Initial dose given for 2–3 months, followed by lower dose for remainder of studies. (‡) Servings of

effects of ﬁsh oil on triglycerides, HDL and LDL cholesterol
were all highly signiﬁcant (P < 0.001). Despite the hetero-
geneity across studies, the meta-analysis results did not sub-
stantially (or signiﬁcantly) change either with removal of the
GISSI study – which contributed both the majority of sub-
jects and the majority of weight in the meta-analyses – or
with removal of outlier studies.

To further examine the study heterogeneity, meta-
regression was performed (Table 2). Across studies, there
were signiﬁcant, independent associations between the effect
of ﬁsh oil consumption on triglyceride levels and both the
dose of ﬁsh oil used and the baseline triglyceride levels.
Across studies, each increase in ﬁsh oil dose of 1 g/day was
associated with a decrease in triglycerides of approximately
8 mg/dL. Likewise, each 10 mg/dL increase in the mean
baseline triglyceride level was associated with an additional
1.6 mg/dL decrease in triglycerides after ﬁsh oil consump-
tion. However, ﬁsh oil dose and baseline triglyceride levels

interacted with each other, such that in studies with low base-
line triglycerides (e.g., 60 mg/dL) higher ﬁsh oil dose was
predicted to have a small effect (e.g.,−2 mg/dL per additional
g ﬁsh oil), while in studies with high baseline triglycerides
(e.g., 294 mg/dL) higher ﬁsh oil dose was predicted to have
a much larger effect (e.g., −19 mg/dL per additional g ﬁsh
oil). Study duration was not associated with treatment effect
between 4 weeks and 2 years suggesting that once the max-
imal effect was achieved it was maintained throughout the
intervention period. The control rate – the change in triglyc-
eride levels in the control group – and study quality were also
not associated with treatment effect.

The four studies that compared different ﬁsh oil doses
[17,26,33,35] similarly found that the greatest net decreases
in triglycerides occurred among subjects consuming the high-
est doses of ﬁsh oil; although no study reported on the sta-
tistical signiﬁcance of this effect. One study likewise found
larger effects of ﬁsh oil among subjects in successively higher

24

quartiles of baseline triglyceride levels; although, again no
statistical analysis was reported [20]. The effect of duration
of ﬁsh oil consumptions was inconsistent among four studies
that reported outcomes at different time points [21,30,33,35].
Evaluation of the studies that reported HDL cholesterol
suggested that interventions in which the subjects in the con-
trol arms had a greater (positive) change in their HDL levels
from baseline reported a smaller net increase in HDL in the
experimental group after ﬁsh oil consumption. This possi-
bly implies that ﬁsh oil may be most effective at raising (or
stabilizing) HDL levels in people whose HDL levels would
otherwise decrease with time. Of note, in the GISSI study,
the mean HDL level in the control arms rose by 6 mg/dL and
the net effect on HDL was smaller than the meta-analysis
average across studies (see Fig. 1).

Although across studies ﬁsh oil consumption had no sig-
niﬁcant effect on total cholesterol, baseline total cholesterol
was associated with treatment effect, such that each 10 mg/dL
increase in the mean baseline total cholesterol was associated
with an additional 0.8 mg/dL decrease after ﬁsh oil consump-
tion. None of the tested outcomes were associated with the
effect of ﬁsh oil consumption on LDL cholesterol levels. Indi-
vidual studies generally conﬁrmed that lack of association of
either ﬁsh oil dose or duration of ﬁsh oil consumption and
HDL cholesterol effect [17,21,24,26,29,33,36], LDL effect
[17,33,36], or total cholesterol [17,21,24,26,29,30,33,35,36].
Further subgroup analyses and meta-regressions failed to
elicit other sources of heterogeneity among the studies. Qual-
itative review of the studies, which also included speciﬁc
evaluations of age and sex also failed to uncover an explana-
tion for the large range of net effects seen across studies.

An additional set of meta-analyses were performed to
investigate at what point the published randomized trial data
were sufﬁcient to yield the same results as were found by the
current complete analyses. These cumulative meta-analyses
sequentially add studies based on year of publication [41].
Regarding the effect of ﬁsh oil on triglycerides, by 1992,
after the publication of three studies, meta-analysis revealed
a statistically signiﬁcant improvement (P < 0.05). The esti-
mate of the effect size stabilized at −28 mg/dL in 1994 with
six studies. Also by 1994, with the publication of six studies,
the effect of ﬁsh oil on HDL cholesterol was both statisti-
cally signiﬁcant and stable. The effect on LDL cholesterol
was statistically signiﬁcant after publication of the earliest
two studies we reviewed in 1992; however, the estimate of the
effect size was larger at that time (a net increase of 10 mg/dL)
and did not stabilize until the publication of eight studies
by 1997. Notably, all cumulative meta-analyses were statis-
tically signiﬁcant and stable prior to the publication of the
GISSI study, with over 5000 subjects consuming ﬁsh oil, in
1999.

3.2.2. ALA

Five studies reported on the effect of ALA consumption
on lipids (Table 3) [33,37–40]. The studies were mostly of
poor quality, but broad applicability. Three studies used plant

oil supplements or margarine with 4.5 to about 5 g ALA;
two studies used variations on the “Mediterranean diet” with
approximately 2 g/day of omega-3 fatty acids. The only study
to ﬁnd signiﬁcant improvements in all lipids, by Singh et al.,
was a problematic study [39]. Issues related to this study’s
reliability have been examined by several bodies [42,43]. The
remaining studies generally found small effects (≤2 mg/dL
net change) on total cholesterol, LDL, and HDL. An older
study reported a 13 mg/dL (4%) net increase in total choles-
terol, but no statistical analysis was performed. The remain-
ing two studies that reported triglyceride effects both found
non-signiﬁcant changes of at least 10%, but in opposite direc-
tions.

3.3. Glucose homeostasis

We reviewed the 28 largest randomized trials that con-
tained data on omega-3 fatty acid intake and either Hgb A1c
or FBS (Table 2) [23,27,30,33,39,44–66]. Of these, 24 eval-
uated ﬁsh oil, three ﬁsh (or “Mediterranean”) diets, and two
plant oils (one evaluated both ﬁsh oil and plant oil). These
studies represented about 1700 subjects. The studies were
generally of fair to good quality, with moderate applicability.

3.3.1. Fish and ﬁsh oil

Twenty-seven studies included 35 individual study arms of
ﬁsh oil or ﬁsh diet that evaluated either Hgb A1c or FBS (Fig. 2
and Table 2). Among the studies of FBS there was a wide
range of net effects found with ﬁsh oil consumption, from
29 mg/dL net reduction to 25 mg/dL net increase. However, in
the majority of studies, the net effects were small (<5%). With
the exception of two outlier studies [60,65], the net effect of
ﬁsh oil on Hgb A1c was small (<5%, between −0.4% and
0.4%).

Across the studies, random effects model meta-analyses
found a non-signiﬁcant net increase in FBS with ﬁsh oil
consumption of +3 (95% CI −0.2, +6) mg/dL and a simi-
larly non-signiﬁcant net increase in Hgb A1c of +0.1% (95%
CI −0.01%, +0.2%). Removal of outlier studies from meta-
analysis did not substantially affect the results.

Meta-regression (Table 2) found signiﬁcant associations
across studies between both baseline FBS and ﬁsh oil dose
and the net effect of ﬁsh oil on FBS. Across studies, each
increase in ﬁsh oil dose of 1 g/day was associated with an
increase in FBS of approximately 3 mg/dL. Likewise, each

oil consumption. Dose and baseline levels did not interact
with each other; the effects of dose were the same at high and
low baseline FBS, and vice versa. The studies of Hgb A1c
were statistically homogeneous, implying a lack of variation
in ﬁndings across studies.

Seven of the 15 studies of FBS, and 14 of 18 Hgb A1c
studies included only subjects with diabetes. The remaining
studies included subjects with either dyslipidemia or cardio-
vascular disease (some of whom may also have had diabetes).
There were no clear difference in effect of ﬁsh oil on either
FBS or Hgb A1c based on the eligibility criteria of the stud-
ies. Only one FBS study and two Hgb A1c studies compared
different doses of ﬁsh oil and found no differences in effect
[33,59,65]. The studies that measured outcomes at different
time points also found no signiﬁcant differences in net effects
[33,44,46,61].

3.3.2. ALA

Two studies reported on the effect of either plant oil mar-
garine or an “Indo-Mediterranean diet” on FBS; no ALA
study evaluated Hgb A1c. As with lipids, Singh et al. reported
a highly signiﬁcant improvement in FBS, though the validity
of these data are in question [39]. In a good quality study,
Finnegan et al. found a similar, though non-signiﬁcant effect
[33].

3.4. hs-CRP

Four prospective studies evaluated the effect of either
ﬁsh oil or ALA on hs-CRP (Table 4) [67–70]. Two stud-
ies evaluated ﬁsh oil supplements of various doses, one a
“Mediterranean diet”, and one an ALA oil diet. Studies were
of fair or poor quality with a range of applicability. There
was a wide range of mean or median baseline hs-CRP levels
across studies and a wide range of calculated net changes
in hs-CRP. However, all studies found that there was no
signiﬁcant change in hs-CRP level with omega-3 fatty acid
consumption.

4. Discussion

Although the relationship between dietary ﬁsh and ﬁsh oil
and CVD risk has been known for some time, the relation-
ship between omega-3 fatty acids and surrogate circulating
markers of CVD risk has been less clear. This area is of
interest in light of our previous observations that in random-
ized studies, compared to placebo, the summary risk ratio
of coronary artery restenosis was in favor of ﬁsh oil is (0.87
[95% CI 0.73, 1.05]) [11]. However, the data from prospective
and cross-sectional studies on carotid IMT were inconsistent.
Furthermore, small non-signiﬁcant improvements in exercise
capacity have been reported after ﬁsh oil supplementation.
There were insufﬁcient data on which to draw conclusions
about the effect of ALA on these outcomes. A previous sys-
tematic review with meta-regression concluded that increased
consumption of ﬁsh oil resulted in, on average, a 2 mmHg
reduction in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure [5].
Numerous other factors related to CVD, including markers
of thrombosis and endothelial function have been evaluated
by a small number of studies, but these remain inconclusive
[6,10].

The most direct effect of increased intake of omega-3 fatty
acids is an increase in the relative proportion of these fatty
acids throughout the body, most thoroughly documented in
serum, platelet and red blood cell phospholipids, which are
the most accessible tissues for testing [10,17,20,32]. How-
ever, whether this change in phospholipids is a mediator of
CVD is unknown.

The results of this review support the conclusion that the
major and most consistent effect of relatively high doses of
dietary omega-3 fatty acids on plasma markers of CVD risk
was that ﬁsh oil consumption decreases triglyceride levels.
This outcome was dose dependent and inﬂuenced by the
baseline plasma triglyceride level of the study subjects. Prior
work has suggested that this effect is in part attributable
to a decrease in the hepatic production of triglyceride rich
particles (VLDL, the lipoprotein responsible for transporting

E.M. Balk et al. / Atherosclerosis 189 (2006) 19–30

27

triglycerides for subsequent delipidation by lipoprotein
and hepatic lipases by peripheral
tissue and the liver,
respectively) and to an increase in fractional clearance rates
[71–73]. Additionally, there is some evidence that omega-3
fatty acids increase the conversion rate of VLDL to LDL,
similar to ﬁbrate drugs [74].

In both cases, modest decreases in the levels of triglyc-
erides are frequently accompanied by increases in the level
of LDL cholesterol. The summary estimate of the change
in triglyceride levels with increased ﬁsh oil consumption
was 27 mg/dL. On an individual basis it is difﬁcult to pre-
dict the effect of this change on clinical outcomes. How-
ever, triglyceride levels ≥150 mg/dL is one of the compo-
nents when classifying individuals with metabolic syndrome.
Therefore, a change in triglyceride levels as observed with
increased ﬁsh oil intake could potentially result in a reclas-
siﬁcation with regard to metabolic syndrome. Concomitant
with lower triglyceride levels, increased ﬁsh oils resulted in
modestly higher LDL cholesterol (6 mg/dL) and HDL choles-
terol levels (1.6 mg/dL), an effect that is consistent with other
interventions that reduced triglyceride levels [75]. Since the
magnitude of the effect of raising HDL cholesterol levels on
CVD is still unclear, and there are no data on the effect of
raising both LDL and HDL cholesterol levels, the clinical
signiﬁcance of these changes in lipoprotein levels remains
unclear [76]. However, given their modest magnitude, they
are unlikely to have a large independent effect on CHD risk.
Concern has been raised that ﬁsh oils may worsen
glycemic control in diabetic subjects [77,78], although this
concern is by no means universal [79,80]. The results of our
assessment indicate that within the doses of ﬁsh oil provided
to the subjects, there was little effect on FBS or Hgb A1c lev-
els. Although there was a certain level of variability among
studies there was not an indication of adverse effects of ﬁsh
oil on glucose homeostasis.
acids

anti-
inﬂammatory effects [81]. Observational data suggests that
dietary ﬁsh oil and ALA are inversely associated with CRP
level, whereas,
the intervention data are less consistent
[67,82–88]. Intervention studies have also reported an
anti-inﬂammatory effect of ﬁsh and ﬁsh oil supplements on
other inﬂammatory markers [89,90]. Regardless of vehicle,
our analysis indicates that among the few randomized trials
there was no signiﬁcant effect of either ALA, EPA or DHA
on hs-CRP levels. The lack of consistency between the
observational and some of the intervention studies may
be attributable to unidentiﬁed factors that co-varied with
reported intakes of ﬁsh oil that were the responsible agent
and difﬁculties with measuring inﬂammatory markers other
that CRP in large scale observational studies.

have well-established

Omega-3

fatty

The effects of ALA on serum lipids were, for the most
part, not consistent with that reported for the very long chain
omega-3 fatty acids, EPA and DHA. It is likely that the limited
capacity of humans to elongate and desaturate ALA to EPA,
even when ALA is fed at high levels, accounts for this incon-
sistency [8,91,92]. Similarly, it has recently been reported

that not only do humans have a limited capacity to convert
ALA to EPA, but likewise EPA to DHA [8,9]. However, this
latter restriction is unlikely to alter the effect of ﬁsh oil or
very long chain omega-3 fatty acid supplementation on CVD
risk [7].

Overall, while data on the effect of ALA on serum lipids,
Hgb A1c, and FBS are sparse, as are data regarding the
effect of either ﬁsh oil or ALA on CRP, sufﬁcient data have
been reported to conclude that ﬁsh oil consumption lowers
triglyceride levels and has a small beneﬁcial effect on HDL
cholesterol, while raising LDL cholesterol levels by a sim-
ilarly small amount. While questions remain regarding the
optimal dose and type of omega-3 fatty acids, the clinical
signiﬁcance of these changes, and possibly which groups
of people would best be served by increasing ﬁsh oil con-
sumption, it is unlikely that additional studies would change
our conclusions regarding overall treatment effect of ﬁsh oil.
In fact, the publication of the large GISSI study in 1999
did not alter conclusions available in the literature regard-
ing the effect of ﬁsh oil on lipid values had meta-analyses
been performed at that time. Similarly, future studies would
be unlikely to alter the conclusion that ﬁsh oil consumption
has no substantial effect on glucose homeostasis.

ABSTRACT
Objective To systematically review interventional studies
of the effects of alcohol consumption on 21 biological
markers associated with risk of coronary heart disease in
adults without known cardiovascular disease.
Design Systematic review and meta-analysis.
Data sources Medline (1950 to October 2009) and
Embase (1980 to October 2009) without limits.
Study selection Two reviewers independently selected
studies that examined adults without known
cardiovascular disease and that compared fasting levels
of specific biological markers associated with coronary
heart disease after alcohol use with those after a period of
no alcohol use (controls). 4690 articles were screened for
eligibility, the full texts of 124 studies reviewed, and 63
relevant articles selected.
Results Of 63 eligible studies, 44 on 13 biomarkers were
meta-analysed in fixed or random effects models. Quality
was assessed by sensitivity analysis of studies grouped
by design. Analyses were stratified by type of beverage
(wine, beer, spirits). Alcohol significantly increased levels
of high density lipoprotein cholesterol (pooled mean
difference 0.094 mmol/L, 95% confidence interval 0.064
to 0.123), apolipoprotein A1 (0.101 g/L, 0.073 to 0.129),
and adiponectin (0.56 mg/L, 0.39 to 0.72). Alcohol
showed a dose-response relation with high density
lipoprotein cholesterol (test for trend P=0.013). Alcohol
decreased fibrinogen levels (−0.20 g/L, −0.29 to −0.11)
but did not affect triglyceride levels. Results were similar
for crossover and before and after studies, and across
beverage types.
Conclusions Favourable changes in several
cardiovascular biomarkers (higher levels of high density
lipoprotein cholesterol and adiponectin and lower levels
of fibrinogen) provide indirect pathophysiological
support for a protective effect of moderate alcohol use on
coronary heart disease.

INTRODUCTION
Moderate alcohol consumption (up to one drink a day
for women and up to two for men) has been associated
with a decreased risk for certain cardiovascular

diseases, particularly coronary heart disease, in several
studies of diverse populations.1 2 Most of these studies,
however, used an observational design, raising con-
cerns about potential confounding.

Feeding studies (where alcohol is experimentally
administered) free of concerns about confounding
may help to elucidate the mechanisms by which alco-
hol affects cardiovascular disease. In 1999, a systematic
review of experimental studies of alcohol consumption
and changes in lipid levels and haemostatic factors
asserted that the protective association of alcohol on
certain cardiovascular diseases seemed to be mediated
by some of these effects.3 Since that systematic review
was published the breadth of research on this topic has
expanded substantially. Atherosclerosis, the underly-
ing cause of coronary heart disease and ischaemic
stroke, is increasingly understood to be a chronic, low
the arterial wall.4
grade inflammatory disease of
Increased levels of inflammatory markers have been
associated with risk of cardiovascular disease.5 6 New
studies have examined not only the effect of alcohol
on lipid levels and haemostatic factors but also on
other measures of inflammation and endothelial cell
function as well as levels of adipocyte hormones.
Furthermore,
in addition to haemostatic factors,
increased levels of other molecules, such as cellular
adhesion molecules and adipocyte hormones, are
believed to contribute to the development of the sys-
temic
associated with
increased risk of cardiovascular disease.4 7 8

response

A synthesis of

the evidence from experimental
research in this area may inform clinicians trying to
interpret the plausibility of the protective effects of
alcohol on certain aspects of cardiovascular disease
(coronary heart disease) from observational studies.
We therefore systematically reviewed the effect of
experimentally manipulated alcohol consumption
(alcohol use versus a period of no alcohol use) on the
circulating concentrations of selected cellular and
molecular biological markers of atherothrombotic
conditions associated with increased coronary heart
disease

tary, indirect mechanistic evidence to that obtained
from the expanding epidemiological research on the
apparent protective effect of alcohol on certain aspects
of cardiovascular disease.9 10

METHODS
The systematic review was carried out using a prede-
termined protocol and in accordance with published
guidelines for reporting of systematic reviews of rando-
mised controlled trials (PRISMA).

Data sources and searches
We searched for alcohol intervention studies in adults
without pre-existing cardiovascular disease in whom
circulating levels of specific biomarkers were mea-
sured after a specified amount of alcohol had been con-
sumed within a defined timeframe compared with a
period of no alcohol use. We searched Medline (1950
to October 2009) and Embase (1980 to October 2009)
without language restrictions for potentially relevant
articles.

We used a strategy recommended for searching elec-
tronic databases for controlled interventional studies.11
Our search focused on the exposure of interest, rele-
vant outcomes, and study designs. The exposure of
interest was alcohol consumption. The relevant out-
comes were circulating atherothrombotic biological
markers associated with coronary heart disease.
These included lipids (triglycerides, total cholesterol,
high density lipoprotein cholesterol, low density lipo-
protein cholesterol, Lp(a) lipoprotein, and apolipopro-
tein A1), inflammatory markers (C reactive protein,
leucocytes, interleukin 6, tumour necrosis factor α,
and haemostatic factors plasminogen activator inhibi-
tor 1, von Willebrand factor, tissue plasminogen acti-
vator,
fibrinogen, and e-selectin), endothelial cell
function markers (intracellular adhesion molecule 1
and vascular cell adhesion molecule), and adipocyte
hormones (leptin and adiponectin). Our study designs
of interest were experimental studies involving an
intentional alcohol intervention to modify levels of
biological markers with a no alcohol control. We
included randomised controlled trials with two arms,

before and after studies, and crossover studies. Using
the Boolean operator “and” in varying combinations
we then combined the three comprehensive search
themes. See web extra appendix 1 for the complete
Medline search strategy.

In addition to searching the electronic databases we
consulted the bibliography of the only pre-existing sys-
tematic review on this subject.3 One of the authors
(KJM) served as our content expert and provided us
with input on captured literature and direction on per-
tinent studies in the grey literature.

Study selection
Relevant articles were selected using a two phase pro-
cess. Two researchers (SEB and PER) independently
reviewed all
identified abstracts for eligibility. All
abstracts reporting on the effect of alcohol consump-
tion and relevant biomarkers in participants without
pre-existing cardiovascular disease were selected for
full text review. This initial stage was intentionally lib-
eral; we discarded only abstracts that clearly did not
meet
the aforementioned criteria. The inter-rater
agreement for this stage was high (κ=0.80, 95% confi-
dence interval 0.65 to 0.94). Disagreements were
resolved by consensus. Secondly, full text articles
assessed by one reviewer (SEB) were verified by a sec-
ond reviewer (PER) to determine if the study met the
specified intervention, study population, and design
criteria. Specifically, we included studies if they evalu-
ated the circulating blood levels of the specified bio-
markers during a period of intentional, prescribed
alcohol feeding versus a period of no alcohol use. We
excluded studies
if participants had pre-existing
cardiovascular disease or continued to drink “usual
alcohol” in addition to the amounts of intervention
alcohol. Both published and unpublished studies
were eligible for inclusion.

Data extraction and quality assessment
From relevant studies we extracted information on
sample size, population demographics (age, number
of men and women, and mean age or age range, or
both), inclusion and exclusion criteria (pre-existing
health conditions, smoking status, drugs), study design
(crossover, randomised crossover, randomised two
arm, and before and after), characteristics of the alco-
hol intervention (amount, frequency, type, duration),
use of a concomitant diet intervention, biomarkers
sampled, and the mean concentration and error mea-
surements (standard deviation, standard error, or con-
fidence intervals) of specific biomarkers sampled after
the alcohol intervention and after no alcohol use.
When available we extracted information on amount
of alcohol consumed, using grams of alcohol per day as
the common unit of measure. When a study did not
specifically report the grams of alcohol per unit, we
used 12.5 g alcohol per drink for analysis.2 12 For exam-
ple, if a study indicated that the intervention was 30 g of
alcohol a day, we estimated this as 30 g alcohol a day
divided by 12.5 g alcohol a drink equals about 2.5
drinks a day. We standardised portions as a 12 oz
(355 mL) bottle or can of beer, a 5 oz (148 mL) glass
of wine, and 1.5 oz (44 mL) of 80 proof (40% alcohol)
distilled spirits.1 We categorised the volume of alcohol
intake as <2.5 g/day (<0.5 drink), 2.5-14.9 g/day
(about 0.5-1 drink), 15-29.9 g/day (about 1-2.5 drinks),
30-60 g/day (about 2.5-5 drinks), and >60 g/day (≥5
drinks).

We assessed study quality using a previously out-
lined component approach.13 Study design was consid-
ered the most important measure of quality, with
randomised studies (crossover and prospective two
arm controlled studies) judged to have a higher quality
than before and after studies. We carried out sensitivity
analyses based on study design to evaluate the effect of
this aspect of study quality.13 We also reported several

aspects of the quality of studies in meta-analysis: ran-
domisation, assessment of compliance with alcohol
consumption or abstinence, losses owing to attrition,
and relevant confounders, such as smoking, diabetes,
overweight or obesity or dietary controls. We did not
assess blinding of participants to the intervention
because it was uncertain if blinding alcohol use was
effective. We report these study characteristics based
on the quality assessment proposed by Jadad et al.14

Data synthesis and analysis
The common unit of measurement across all studies
was the mean change (standard error) in the level of
each biomarker after alcohol consumption compared
with the no alcohol control. This was calculated as
(mean concentration of biomarker during alcohol con-
sumption)−(mean concentration of biomarker during
no alcohol consumption). To determine the standard
error of the mean change, we used the calculation: stan-
dard error mean change=square
root[(standard

2/sample sizeno alcohol)+(standard
deviationno alcohol
2/sample sizealcohol)]. Not all studies
deviationalcohol
included in the systematic review reported results in
this manner. We converted error measurements
reported as standard errors to standard deviations
using the formula standard deviation=(standard
error)×square root (sample size).15 For studies that did
not report mean concentrations of biomarkers either
before or after the intervention or that reported results
in graphical format only, we contacted the study
authors to obtain data suitable for inclusion in our
study. In all cases the authors failed to supply the neces-
sary data to determine the mean change in biomarker
level, and we therefore excluded these studies from
meta-analyses.

When at least two studies reported the mean change
in level of a specific biomarker we carried out meta-
analyses of the effect of alcohol consumption on bio-
marker concentrations. All analyses were done using
Stata 10.0. To assess heterogeneity of the mean change

a statistically significant effect of alcohol was observed
and five or more studies were meta-analysed.

RESULTS
The literature search identified 4690 articles pertaining
to the relevant exposure, outcomes, and study designs
(fig 1). Two additional articles were added from the
bibliographic search. No additional articles were sug-
gested by the content expert (KJM). After the final
review, 63 articles were deemed eligible for analysis.
Selected studies examined the effect of alcohol con-
sumption on: lipid biomarkers (47 studies), inflamma-
tory markers (13), haemostatic factors (14), endothelial
factors (3), and adipocyte hormones (8). Many of the
studies examined several of the biomarkers (fig 1).

studies used a crossover design and 24 used a before
and after design, whereas three were parallel arm con-
trolled trials. The control beverage was generally
water, fruit juice, or a de-alcoholised drink (wine or
beer), and most studies included a washout period of
no alcohol use that was of similar duration to the period
of alcohol intervention. Several studies included parti-
cipants whose clinical characteristics may have influ-
enced some of the biomarkers (for example, patients
with diabetes, smokers, or those who were overweight
or obese). Twenty eight (44%) studies controlled for an
increase in caloric intake from alcohol consumption
with isocaloric or controlled diets, whereas others
maintained their usual diet. Six studies included peo-
ple who were overweight or obese and three studies
specifically examined inactive people compared with
regular runners.

Meta-analyses
Of the 63 studies, 44 reported adequate data to permit
pooled analyses (see web extra figure). Most com-
monly, studies could not be included because they
did not report data in a format that permitted pooling
(for example, graphically or as percentage change), or
did not report error calculations. The subsets of identi-
fied studies with adequate data dealt with levels of high
density lipoprotein cholesterol (33 of 44), total choles-
terol (26 of 32), triglycerides (31 of 39), low density
lipoprotein cholesterol (24 of 28), apolipoprotein A1
(16 of 22), Lp(a) lipoprotein (3 of 5), C reactive protein
(5 of 8), interleukin 6 (2 of 4), tumour necrosis factor α
(3 of 7), plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (3 of 3), tis-
sue plasminogen activator (3 of 4), fibrinogen (7 of 8),
and adiponectin (4 of 7; see web extra figure). See web
extra appendix 2 for details about exclusion of studies
from meta-analysis.

Lipid biomarkers
The pooled analysis of the effect of alcohol consump-
tion on mean high density lipoprotein cholesterol
showed a consistent increase in these levels but with
significant heterogeneity among studies (fig 2 and
table 2; P=0.005). Pooling of studies stratified by
dose may partially explain this heterogeneity. A signif-
icant dose-response was observed between alcohol

consumption and high density lipoprotein cholesterol
levels (fig 2): 12.5-29.9 g/day (1-2 drinks, n=7), mean
difference of 0.072 mmol/L (95% confidence interval:
0.024 to 0.119); 30-60 g/day (2-4 drinks, n=24), mean
difference of 0.103 mmol/L (0.065 to 0.141); and
>60 g/day (≥5 drinks, n=2), mean difference of
0.141 mmol/L (0.042 to 0.240; P for trend 0.013). Simi-
lar to the effect with high density lipoprotein choles-
terol, apolipoprotein A1 also significantly increased
in a random effects model pooling 16 studies (table 2).
In contrast, alcohol consumption did not signifi-
cantly change levels of total cholesterol, low density
lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, or Lp(a) lipopro-
tein (table 2). The 24 studies reporting on low density
lipoprotein cholesterol were pooled using a random
effects model because heterogeneity was present.
Pooled analyses stratified by dose of alcohol also
showed no significant effects of alcohol on low density
lipoprotein cholesterol. Pooled analysis of the impact
of alcohol by dose on triglycerides showed a significant
increase at the highest dose of alcohol (>60 g/day) in
the two studies reporting alcohol consumption at this
dose: mean difference 0.274 mmol/L (0.043 to 0.505),
test for heterogeneity P=0.763 (fig 3).

Inflammatory markers
The association of alcohol with levels of C reactive pro-
tein, interleukin 6, and tumour necrosis factor α was
not significant (table 2). Only one study reported that
alcohol (in this case beer) increased leucocyte levels in
women (0.51 (SD 0.47)×109/L) but not in men (0.19
(SD 0.31)×109/L).63

Haemostatic factors
Fibrinogen levels significantly decreased after alcohol
consumption (fig 4 and table 2). Meta-analyses of the
remaining haemostatic biomarkers, however, did not
show any significant effect of alcohol, including plas-
minogen activator inhibitor 1 and tissue plasminogen
activator antigens (table 2).

Data were insufficient to permit meta-analysis for
plasminogen, thromboxane, von Willebrand factor,
and e-selectin levels. One study reported a significant
increase in plasminogen levels after red wine con-
sumption in 12 men.60 Another study reported a

reporting on the effect of alcohol on von Willebrand
factor found no significant change in these biomarker

increase after alcohol consumption,81 whereas another
study found no change.38

Endothelial factors
Three studies reported on the impact of alcohol on
intracellular adhesion molecule 1 and two reported
on vascular cellular adhesion molecule levels. How-
ever, only one study reported data suitable for pooling
for each biomarker. Two studies showed no impact of

cellular adhesion molecule 1 after consumption of
red wine but not after gin.38 One study reported no
change in vascular cellular adhesion molecule after
alcohol consumption,37 whereas another found a sig-
nificant decrease after consumption of red wine but
not after gin.38

Adipocyte hormones
Adiponectin levels were consistently significantly
increased after alcohol consumption (fig 4). Only two
studies reported on the effect of alcohol on levels of
leptin; one study found a significant increase after alco-
hol consumption64 and the other no effect.37

Sensitivity analyses
Study quality
Study quality was analysed using the component
approach,13 focusing primarily on study design as the
most important quality factor. Sensitivity analyses
were stratified by the two major study designs in
selected studies (24 crossover studies, 18 before and
after studies), with crossover studies being considered
the more robust study design. The findings of these
stratified sensitivity analyses are in web extra appendix
3 and show generally similar results for both types of

study design from analyses that include a sufficient
number of studies to yield stable pooled estimates—
that is, high density lipoprotein cholesterol, low den-
sity lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, and fibrino-
gen. This sensitivity analysis suggests that, regardless
of the study design, alcohol had consistent effects on
biomarker levels.

See web extra appendix 4 for additional study qual-
ity characteristics. Of the 44 studies meta-analysed, 17
randomised the participants into treatment groups but
only one study described the randomisation process.
Forty three of the 44 studies described the presence
of relevant covariates, such as diet, smoking, and phy-
sical activity. Twenty of the studies measured compli-
ance with alcohol consumption, whereas 24 described
losses to attrition.

Beverage type
Analyses were also stratified by beverage type (wine,
beer, spirits). The results were similar to the combined
analyses of all beverage types (see web extra appendix
3).

Publication bias
Evidence of publication bias was assessed for high den-
sity lipoprotein cholesterol, apolipoprotein A1, and
fibrinogen. No asymmetry was found on visual inspec-
tion of the funnel plot for each biomarker, suggesting
that significant publication bias was unlikely. This was
further confirmed by a non-significant Begg test for
each outcome of interest (high density lipoprotein cho-
lesterol P=0.12, apolipoprotein A1 P=0.064, and fibri-
nogen P=0.88).

DISCUSSION
This meta-analysis shows that moderate consumption
of alcohol (up to one drink or 15 g alcohol a day for
women and up to two drinks or 30 g alcohol a day for
men) has beneficial effects on a variety of biomarkers
linked to the risk of coronary heart disease. The experi-
mental
interventional studies showed that alcohol

consumption significantly increased circulating levels
of high density lipoprotein cholesterol, apolipoprotein
A1, and adiponectin and significantly decreased fibri-
nogen levels, all changes reported to be cardio
protective.4-8

Comparison with other studies
The findings from our review expand on those
reported a decade ago by Rimm et al,3 which focused
only on alcohol’s effect on lipids and haemostatic fac-
tors. Since that review substantial growth has occurred
in research on the effect of alcohol on the more tradi-
tional biomarkers associated with cardiovascular risk
as well as on newer biomarkers such as inflammatory
markers, endothelial factors, and adipocyte hormones.
To identify eligible studies we followed a similar pro-
tocol to that used by the previous reviewers, but we
also required that eligible studies had to compare fast-
ing levels of biomarkers after alcohol consumption
with those from a period of no alcohol use.

Similar to the review by Rimm et al, our updated
meta-analyses found increases in levels of high density
lipoprotein cholesterol and apolipoprotein A1. For
30 g alcohol consumed a day (about two drinks)
Rimm et al reported an increase in high density lipo-
protein cholesterol level of 3.99 mg/dL (0.103 mmol/
L) (95% confidence interval 3.25 to 4.73) and an
increase in apolipoprotein A1 of 8.82 mg/dL (7.79 to
9.86). For a similar dose of alcohol (30 g a day was the
standard dose used by Rimm et al), our results are
nearly the same: an increase in high density lipoprotein
cholesterol level of 3.66 mg/dL (95% confidence inter-
val: 2.22 to 5.13) and an increase in apolipoprotein A1
of 8.67 mg/dL (6.81 to 10.32). In contrast with the
study by Rimm et al, however, we observed that alco-
hol consumption significantly decreased fibrinogen
concentrations. Evidence that alcohol decreases fibri-
nogen levels from experimental studies supports an
important postulated mechanism by which alcohol
consumption protects against certain aspects of cardio-
vascular disease, such as coronary heart disease.3 83

Another finding that varied from the earlier review
was that alcohol consumption did not increase trigly-
ceride levels aside from pooled results from two studies
of heavy alcohol consumption (>60 g/day, or >4
drinks a day). Although the results of the two studies
should be viewed cautiously as they pool two different
study designs (a crossover study32and a before and after
study34), they do indicate an adverse effect of heavy
alcohol consumption on triglyceride levels. At low
levels of alcohol consumption, our findings do not sup-
port the previously reported association of alcohol
consumption and raised triglyceride levels. Further-
more, we also determined that different types of alco-
holic beverage (wine, beer, and spirits) have similar
effects on biomarkers. Inferences on beverage type
should be viewed with some caution, however, as
most of the studies used wine as the alcohol inter-
vention. This preference for using wine, and in most
cases red wine, as the type of alcohol for intervention
may be related to the other chemical components of

red wine, such as polyphenols, which are believed to
have cardioprotective effects.30 38 42 45 50 However, it is
interesting that in many of these studies, comparisons
were made either with a non-red wine alcohol inter-
vention or with de-alcoholised red wine and it was con-
cluded that the effect observed was most likely due to
alcohol rather than to the other components in red
wine.30 42 45

This review also examined results for several other
biomarkers that had not previously been evaluated,
most notably adiponectin, an abundant adipocyte hor-
mone that has been associated with lower risk of both
diabetes84 and coronary heart disease.85 In pooled ana-
lyses, adiponectin levels were significantly increased
by alcohol
these findings
extend previous evidence supporting an apparent cau-
sal role for alcohol consumption in preventing coron-
ary heart disease through favourable effects on levels of
high density lipoprotein cholesterol, fibrinogen, and
adiponectin and limited adverse effects on triglycer-
ides at levels of alcohol consumption that are consid-
ered “not risky.”

intake. Taken together,

Potential biological mechanisms and clinical context
Our results thus implicate reverse cholesterol trans-
port, haemostasis, and insulin sensitivity in the path-
way by which alcohol consumption might prevent
cardiovascular disease. The mechanisms by which
alcohol influences high density lipoprotein choles-
terol, fibrinogen, and adiponectin are not fully under-
stood.
In the case of high density lipoprotein
cholesterol, various mechanisms have been proposed,
including an increased transport rate of lipoproteins36
and increased lipoprotein lipase activity.58 86 The effect
on fibrinogen is also not well understood, although
alcohol seems to influence the conformation and stabi-
lity of fibrinogen molecules.87 For adiponectin, one
study showed that alcohol consumption increases
expression of the ADIPOQ gene in adipose tissue,
but little else is known about this effect.51

Our findings need to be put into a clinical context.
The significant changes in levels of high density lipo-
protein cholesterol, fibrinogen, and adiponectin after
alcohol consumption were well within a pharmacolo-
gically relevant magnitude. In our systematic review,
we determined that alcohol consumption increased
high density lipoprotein cholesterol levels by about
0.1 mmol/L overall and in a dose-response manner
(0.072 mmol/L for 1-2 drinks a day, 0.10 mmol/L for
2-4 drinks a day, and 0.14 mmol/L for ≥4 drinks a day).
This degree of increase is greater than any currently
available single pharmacological therapy, including
fibrates (approved by the Food and Drug Administra-
tion for people with low levels of high density lipopro-
tein cholesterol). For example, a systematic review of
fibrates on high density lipoprotein cholesterol levels
showed an overall increase of 2.6 mg/dL88 compared
with our findings of alcohol increasing high density
lipoprotein cholesterol levels by 3.5-4 mg/dL. Simi-
larly, alcohol consumption decreased fibrinogen levels
by 0.20 g/L. Given that an increase of 1 g/L has been

WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPIC

Observational studies suggest that moderate alcohol intake is associated with lower risk of
various cardiovascular events, particularly coronary heart disease

Interventional studies showed that alcohol favourably influences various biomarkers
associated with risk of coronary heart disease

WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS

Moderate alcohol consumption had favourable effects on levels of high density lipoprotein
cholesterol, apolipoprotein A1, adiponectin, and fibrinogen

These results strengthen the case for a causal link between alcohol intake and reduced risk of
coronary heart disease

associated with a nearly threefold increase in risk of
coronary heart disease in pooled cohort studies,89 this
magnitude of decrease in fibrinogen could account for
a substantial decrease in heart disease among
drinkers.90 The clinical implications of alcohol’s effect
on adiponectin is less certain since this biomarker is
less commonly examined in the clinical setting. An
increase of about 0.6 mg/L represents approximately
1 standard deviation in adiponectin levels in the col-
lected trials, or similar to the effect of thiazolinediones
on this insulin sensitising adipokine.91

Limitations of the study
Our review has some limitations and caveats. We did
not formally search the grey literature, but we are con-
fident that our search of the peer reviewed literature
captured all relevant articles. The studies that we
pooled did lack uniformity. Duration and dosing of
the alcohol interventions were, however, different, as
were the characteristics of the participants. Therefore it
is possible that potential confounders such as smoking,
physical inactivity, body weight, and diet could have
affected our findings.92 Also, none of
the studies
blinded participants to alcohol consumption. How-
ever, owing to the taste and physiological effects of
alcohol, it may not be possible to blind participants to
this intervention. We chose to evaluate stable circulat-
ing cellular and molecular biomarkers associated with
cardiovascular disease, in particular atherothrombotic
and coronary heart disease. More variable measures,
such as blood pressure, can be influenced by alcohol in
complex, biphasic directions after ingestion and hence
are less amenable to being summarised. Our selection
of biomarkers for study was guided by links to cardio-
vascular pathophysiology. Other biomarkers may be
of relevance to alcohol’s effects on other health condi-
tions—for example, cancer.12 Lastly, although we
found that alcohol consumption has favourable effects
on some of the biomarkers associated with coronary
heart disease, this remains indirect evidence for the
mechanisms by which alcohol may cause cardio-
protection.

consumption on biomarkers associated with cardio-
vascular disease, and produces compelling, indirect
evidence in support of a causal protective effect of alco-
hol. Our companion systematic review assessing alco-
hol associations with clinically relevant cardiovascular
end points offers parallel evidence of the protective
effect of alcohol consumption.93 These combined
reviews provide a foundation of knowledge on which
clinical and public health messaging can be discussed.

Fruits and Vegetables Consumption and Risk of Stroke

A Meta-Analysis of Prospective Cohort Studies

Dan Hu, MD; Junqian Huang, MD; Yuchun Wang, MD; Dongfeng Zhang, MD; Yan Qu, MD

Background and Purpose—We conducted a meta-analysis to summarize evidence from prospective cohort studies about the 

association of fruits and vegetables consumption with the risk of stroke.

Methods—Pertinent studies were identified by a search of Embase and PubMed databases to January 2014. Study-specific 
relative risks with 95% confidence intervals were pooled using a random-effects model. Dose–response relationship was 
assessed by restricted cubic spline.

Results—Twenty  prospective  cohort  studies  were  included,  involving  16 981  stroke  events  among  760 629  participants. 
The multivariable relative risk (95% confidence intervals) of stroke for the highest versus lowest category of total fruits 
and vegetables consumption was 0.79 (0.75–0.84), and the effect was 0.77 (0.71–0.84) for fruits consumption and 0.86 
(0.79–0.93) for vegetables consumption. Subgroup and meta-regression showed that the inverse association of total fruits 
and vegetables consumption with the risk of stroke was consistent in subgroup analysis. Citrus fruits, apples/pears, and 
leafy vegetables might contribute to the protection. The linear dose–response relationship showed that the risk of stroke 
decreased by 32% (0.68 [0.56–0.82]) and 11% (0.89 [0.81–0.98]) for every 200 g per day increment in fruits consumption 
(P for nonlinearity=0.77) and vegetables consumption (P for nonlinearity=0.62), respectively.

Conclusions—Fruits and vegetables consumption are inversely associated with the risk of stroke.    (Stroke. 2014;45:00-00.)

Key  Words:  fruit  ◼  meta-analysis  ◼  stroke  ◼  vegetables

During the past 4 decades, age-adjusted stroke incidence 

rate in high-income countries decreased by 42% (from 
163  to  94  per  100 000  person-years),  whereas  the  stroke 
incidence rate more than doubled (from 52–117 per 100 000 
person-years) in low- to middle-income countries.1 The rates 
of  age-adjusted  stroke  mortality  and  disability-adjusted  life 
years lost were also higher in low-income countries than in 
middle-income  or  high-income  countries.2  Stroke  was  also 
the  leading  causes  of  death  in  China  in  2010  (1.7  million 
deaths).3  Improving  diet  and  lifestyle  is  critical  for  cardio-
vascular  disease  risk  reduction  in  the  general  population.3,4 
In particular, a diet rich in vegetables and fruits is highly rec-
ommended, because it meets the micronutrient, macronutri-
ent,  and  fiber  requirements  without  adding  substantially  to 
overall energy consumption.4 However, the prevalence of low 
fruits  and  vegetables  consumption  is  high  worldwide,  and 
especially in low- and middle-income countries.5,6 According 
to  the  bulletin  of  the  World  Health  Organization,  increas-
ing individual fruits and vegetables consumption to ≥600 g 
per day could reduce the burden of ischemic stroke by 19% 
worldwide7 and 10% to 15% among members of the European 
Union.8 In recent years, many prospective cohort studies have 
been conducted to assess the effect of fruits and vegetables 

consumption on the risk of stroke, and both positive9–14 and 
negative15–19  associations  were  found,  and  the  magnitude  of 
association (relative risk [RR] with 95% confidence interval 
[CI])  varied  from  0.35  (0.13–0.96)9  to  1.35  (0.92–1.97).20 
Results  from  the  recent  prospective  cohort  studies9–21  have 
not  been  summarized  with  a  meta-analysis,  and  the  dose–
response relationship as well as the potential threshold effect 
of  fruits  and  vegetables  consumption  on  the  risk  of  stroke 
is  also  unknown.7  In  addition,  studies  with  relatively  small 
number of participants might be underpowered to detect the 
effect, and even small health effects of fruits and vegetables 
consumption  on  the  risk  of  stroke  could  have  considerable 
public  health  consequences  considering  the  popularity  of 
fruits  and  vegetables  consumption;  thus,  we  conducted  a 
meta-analysis to quantitatively assess the effect of fruits and 
vegetables consumption on the risk of stroke.

Methods
Literature Search and Selection

infarction))  AND  ((fruit*)  OR  vegetabl*),  restricting  to  studies 
conducted in humans. We also used information of bibliographies 
from retrieved articles. For inclusion, studies had to fulfill the fol-
lowing  criteria:  a  prospective  cohort  design;  exposure  of  interest 
was fruits or vegetables; outcome of interest was stroke; and RR 
(95%  CI)  was  provided.  If  multiple  published  reports  from  the 
same  study  cohort  were  available,  we  included  the  one  with  the 
largest number of cases.

Data Extraction
Data we collected included the name of first author, year of publi-
cation, geographic location, duration of follow-up, participants’ age, 
sample size, number of cases, methods for the measurement of fruits 
and  vegetables  consumption,  RR  (95%  CI)  for  the  highest  versus 
lowest  fruits  and  vegetables  consumption,  and  adjusted  covariates. 
For  dose–response  analysis,  the  number  of  cases  and  participants 
(person-years) and RR (95% CI) for each category of fruits and veg-
etables consumption were also extracted. For each study, the median 
level of fruits and vegetables consumption for each category was as-
signed to each corresponding RR estimate. If upper boundary of the 
highest category was not provided, we assumed that the boundary had 
the same amplitude as the adjacent category.

Statistical Analysis
Study-specific  logarithms  of  RR  estimates  were  combined  using 
a  random-effects  model,  which  considers  both  within-study  and 
 between-study  variation.  If  the  RRs  for  fruits  and  vegetables  con-
sumption  were  reported  separately  in  a  study,  we  first  fist-pooled 
these  2  RRs  and  used  the  combined  estimate  for  that  study  in  the 
meta-analysis of total fruits and vegetables consumption and the risk 
of stroke. Statistical heterogeneity among studies was assessed using 
I2 statistic, and I2 values of 25%, 50%, and 75% represent low, moder-
ate, and high heterogeneity, respectively.22 We performed a sensitivity 
analysis in which 1 study at a time was removed and the rest analyzed 
to  evaluate  whether  the  results  could  have  been  affected  markedly 
by a single study. Publication bias was evaluated with Egger regres-
sion test. Meta-regression and subgroup analysis were conducted to 
explore potential sources of heterogeneity and perform comparison 
between groups, and the P value from meta-regression was calculated 
with a permutation test of 1000 to control the spurious findings. Study 
quality was assessed using the 9-star Newcastle–Ottawa scale (http://
www.ohri.ca/programs/clinical_epidemiology/oxford.asp).  The  re-
sults  for  both  sexes  were  included  as  2  separate  results  if  the  total 
result was not reported within a cohort.

A  2-stage  random-effects  dose–response  meta-analysis  was  per-
formed to examine a potential nonlinear relationship.23 Briefly, a re-
stricted  cubic  spline  model  with  3  knots  at  percentiles  25%,  50%, 
and 75% of the distribution of fruits and vegetables consumption was 
estimated, and then the 2 regression coefficients (3 knots minus 1) 
and the variance/covariance matrix within each study were combined 
in a multivariate random-effects meta-analysis. The average serving 
was calculated as 77 g for vegetables and 80 g for fruits.24 A P value 
for nonlinearity was calculated by testing the null hypothesis that the 
coefficient of the second spline is equal to 0. Stata 12.0 was used, and 
P<0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Results

Literature Search and Study Characteristics
The  flow  chart  for  study  inclusion  is  shown  in  Figure  I  in 
the  online-only  Data  Supplement.  After  excluding  5  case–
control  studies  and  4  duplicate  publications,  24  results 
from  20  prospective  cohort  studies9–21,25–31  were  included, 
because 2 results (male and female) were reported in 4 stud-
ies.11,16,26,29  Six  studies  were  from  the  United  States,  8  from 
Europe, and 6 from Asia (Japan and China). The mean dura-
tion  of  follow-up  ranged  from  3.09  to  37  years.  Fruits  and 

vegetables  consumption  were  assessed  with  interviewer  or 
self-administered food frequency questionnaire in all studies, 
except for 3 studies (24-hour recall,31 dietary history method,30 
7-day household inventory).21 Most of the studies adjusted for 
known risk factors of cardiovascular diseases such as smoking 
(but  1  study),21  alcohol  (but  3  studies),13,19,21  blood  pressure 
or hypertension (but 5 studies),15,17,20,21,28 physical activity (but 
4 studies),17,21,26,30 and body mass index (but 3 studies).21,28,30 
Two studies did not correct for age.15,27 The included studies 
met the quality score of 6 to 8 stars. Detailed information of 
included studies is shown in Table I in the online-only Data 
Supplement.

Quantitative Synthesis
The main results are summarized in the Table.

Total Fruits and Vegetables Consumption and Risk of 
Stroke
Highest  versus  lowest  levels  of  total  fruits  and  vegetables 
consumption were inversely associated with the risk of stroke 
(0.79  [0.75–0.84];  I2=16.6%;  Figure  1),  and  the  effect  was 
0.79  (0.74–0.83;  I2=11.9%)  after  excluding  the  2  studies15,27 
that did not correct for age. Borderline publication bias was 
found (P=0.05), and small-study effects9,11,21 were found in the 
funnel  plot  (Figure  II  in  the  online-only  Data  Supplement). 
After excluding 3 studies with small-study effects, no publica-
tion bias was found (P=0.77), and the re-estimated effect was 
0.81 (0.77–0.84; I2=0.00%). Sensitivity analysis showed that 
the overall pooled estimate did not vary substantially with the 
exclusion of any 1 study (Figure III in the online-only Data 
Supplement).

Fruits Consumption and Risk of Stroke
Highest  versus  lowest  levels  of  fruits  consumption  were 
inversely associated with the risk of stroke (0.77 [0.71–0.84]; 
I2=52.3%; Figure IV in the online-only Data Supplement), and 
the effect was 0.76 (0.70–0.83; I2=46.2%) after excluding the 
2 studies15,27 that did not correct for age. However, publication 
bias  was  found  (P=0.02),  and  small-study  effects11,20,21  were 
found in the funnel plot. After excluding these 3 studies, no 
publication  bias  was  found  (P=0.27),  and  the  re-estimated 
effect  was  0.80  (0.74–0.87;  I2=45.4%).  Sensitivity  analysis 
showed that the overall pooled estimate did not vary substan-
tially with the exclusion of any 1 study.

For dose–response analysis, data from 8 prospective cohort 
studies10–12,18,19,26,27,30  were  used,  including  9706  stroke  cases. 
We  found  no  evidence  of  statistically  significant  departure 
from linearity (P for nonlinearity=0.78), and the risk of stroke 
decreased by 32% (0.68 [0.56–0.82]) for every 200 g per day 
increment in fruits consumption. RR (95% CI) of stroke was 
0.90  (0.84–0.96),  0.81  (0.72–0.90),  0.73  (0.62–0.86),  0.66 
(0.55–0.82),  0.60  (0.46–0.79),  0.54  (0.34–0.69),  and  0.45 
(0.28–0.74) for 50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, and 400 g per day 
of fruits consumption, respectively (Figure 2).

Vegetables Consumption and Risk of Stroke
Highest versus lowest levels of vegetables consumption were 
inversely associated with the risk of stroke (0.86 [0.79–0.93]; 
I2=40.3%; Figure IV in the online-only Data Supplement), and 
no publication bias was found (P=0.78). The effect was 0.85

of stroke and citrus fruits (0.72 [0.59–0.88]), leafy vegetables 
(0.88  [0.79–0.98]),  and  apples/pears  (0.88  [0.81–0.97]),  but

and berries (1.05 [0.86–1.27]; Figure V in the online-only Data 
Supplement). All P values from  meta-regression were >0.05.

Discussion

In  this  meta-analysis,  fruits  and  vegetables  consumption  was 
found to be inversely associated with the risk of stroke, and this 
inverse association was consistent in subgroup analysis. In addi-
tion, a linear dose–response relationship showed that the risk 
of stroke decreased by 32% and 11% for every 200 g per day 
increment in fruits and vegetables consumption, respectively.

Several  biological  mechanisms  might  explain  the  inverse 
association.  Both  short-term  controlled  intervention  trials 
and prospective cohort studies have shown that an increase in 
fruits and vegetables consumption can lower blood pressure 
and  also  improve  microvascular  function,32,33  and  favorable

For dose–response analysis, data from 6 prospective cohort 
studies10,12,18,26,27,30 were used, including 8854 stroke cases. We 
found no evidence of statistically significant departure from 
linearity  (P  for  nonlinearity=0.62),  and  the  risk  of  stroke 
decreased by 11% (0.89 [0.81–0.98]) for every 200 g per day 
increment in vegetables consumption. RR (95% CI) of stroke 
was  0.97  (0.95–1.00),  0.94  (0.87–1.01),  0.91  (0.81–1.01), 
0.88 (0.77–0.01), 0.86 (0.74–1.00), 0.84 (0.71–1.01), and 0.80 
(0.62–1.02) for 50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, and 400 g per day 
of vegetables consumption (Figure 3).

  Fruits and Vegetables and Stroke

fruits and vegetables should also be considered. Whether the 
association of fruits and vegetables consumption with the risk 
of stroke is stronger among patients with diabetes mellitus still 
needs to be clarified. However, the abovementioned stronger 
effects might also be caused by the relatively small number of 
cases in the studies (small-study effect).

Although  evidence  from  long-term  randomized  trials  is 
ideal,  these  studies  are  difficult  to  implement  on  a  practical 
basis, especially for an exposure such as fruits and vegetables 
consumption.  Although  observational  studies  cannot  prove 
causality, results of our meta-analysis do meet several of the 
Hill  criteria  for  causation44:  (1)  strength—the  magnitude  of 
this association is not negligible; (2) consistency—the inverse 
association was consistent in all subgroup analyses, and low 
between-study  heterogeneity  was  found  in  most  of  the  sub-
group  analyses;  (3)  temporality—results  from  prospective 
cohort studies consist of an appropriate temporal relationship, 
in  which  the  exposure  precedes  the  outcome;  (4)  biological 
gradient—the  linear  dose–response  relationship  meets  with 
the biological gradient; (5) plausibility and coherence—there 
is theoretical biological plausibility for causality in that fruits 
and  vegetables  protect  against  the  stroke.  However,  the  evi-
dence of experiment—Bradford Hill ultimate criteria for cau-
sation—that random allocation to fruits and vegetables realizes 
a reduction in the incidence of stroke compared with random 
allocation to placebo is lacking, and this randomized design, 
whereby participants are randomized to fruits and vegetables 
consumption or not, would also have minimized the residual 
confounding by failing to adjust for differences in the preva-
lence or level of unrecorded and, therefore, unmeasured impor-
tant prognostic factors among participants who consumed and 
did not consume fruits and vegetables. Although these long-
term randomized trials are difficult to implement, randomized 
trials  have  shown  a  beneficial  effect  of  fruits  and  vegetables 
consumption on blood pressure,45,46 which is a major risk fac-
tor and the harbinger for stroke.47,48 In addition, plasma con-
centrations  of  antioxidant  vitamins  (α-carotene,  β-carotene, 
lutein, β-cryptoxanthin, and ascorbic acid) increased more in 
the intervention group than in controls,46 and dietary advice to 
increase fruits and vegetables consumption showed favorable 
effects on low-density  lipoprotein-cholesterol in trials.49

Dietary constituents are not consumed in isolation,50,51 and 
the  existence  of  correlation  and  interaction  between  dietary 
constituents as well as with other healthy behaviors occurring 
in  clusters  such  as  physical  activity  and  smoking  may  con-
found the diet–disease association. In this meta-analysis, we 
extracted the estimates of risk that reflected the greatest degree 
of  control  for  potential  confounders  from  the  original  stud-
ies, and the associations between fruits and vegetables intake 
and  the  risk  of  stroke  were  consistent  in  both  direction  and 
magnitude in the subgroup analysis by the number of adjusted 
confounders  (≥6  of  the  7  confounders:  smoking,  alcohol, 
blood  pressure/hypertension,  serum  cholesterol,  physical 
activity, body mass index, and ≥3 dietary variables, or <6 of 
the above-mentioned confounders). These findings generally 
indicated that the association of fruits and vegetables intake 
with the reduced risk of stroke may not be the result of con-
founding by other health habits. However, the benefit of fruits 
and  vegetables  in  combination  with  other  healthy  behaviors

effects on other cardiovascular risk factors, such as body mass 
index, waist circumference, total cholesterol and low-density 
lipoprotein-cholesterol,34  inflammation,  and  oxidative  stress, 
were  also  found.35,36  Higher  fruits  and  vegetables  consump-
tion increases micronutrient, carbohydrate, and fiber intakes, 
and  possibly  reduces  fat  intake.6  Nutrients  such  as  potas-
sium,37,38 folate,39,40 antioxidants (vitamin C, β-carotene, and 
flavonoids),41,42 and fiber43 have been shown to be significantly 
associated with a reduced risk for stroke.

A  previous  meta-analysis,  based  on  8  prospective  cohort 
studies including 4917 stroke cases, found that the RR of stroke 
was 0.89 (0.83–0.97) for those with 3 to 5 servings per day and 
0.74  (0.69–0.79)  for  those  with  >5  servings  per  day.24  Since 
then, 13 prospective cohort studies9–21 were also included in this 
meta-analysis, and results from 1 cohort were also updated.14 
In addition, some issues arising from the inconsistent results of 
later studies still need to be confirmed, such as whether it is total 
fruits and vegetables intake that protects against cardiovascular 
disease, or fruit or vegetables alone, and whether the associa-
tion is equally strong in both sexes, or is stronger in a particular 
subset of the population,32 and levels of fruits and vegetables 
intake that give the greatest protection remain unknown.7 This 
meta-analysis, based on 20 prospective cohort studies includ-
ing 16 981 stroke cases, should provide a better understanding 
about fruits and vegetables consumption and the risk of stroke 
with subgroup analysis and dose–response analysis.

As shown in Figure 1, inverse (significantly or not) associa-
tion was found in all included studies, whereas stronger effects 
were  found  in  3  studies  (0.359;  male:  0.40,  female:  0.4711; 
0.43).21 A stronger effect was found in a cohort with type 2 dia-
betes mellitus (0.35),9 between citrus fruit consumption and the 
risk of stroke (male: 0.40, female: 0.47),11 and between child-
hood intake of fruits and vegetables consumption and the risk 
of stroke (0.43).21 In this meta-analysis, a stronger risk estimate 
was also found for citrus fruit consumption than other catego-
ries, and for subjects aged ≤55 years than >55 years, although 
the differences were not significant. In addition, the possibility 
that  younger  people  consume  more  fruit  and  vegetables  and 
that their stroke risk is, therefore, lower and not because of the

may have a greater effect. The main characteristics and results 
of prospective cohort studies on healthy behaviors in clusters 
and  the  risk  of  stroke  are  shown  in  Tables  II  and  III  in  the 
online-only  Data  Supplement.  The  effects  of  highest  versus 
lowest  score  of  dietary  patterns,  such  as  Mediterranean  diet 
or alternate Mediterranean diet, recommended food, prudent 
pattern, healthy dietary pattern, vegetable diet pattern, Dietary 
Approaches to Stop hypertension diet, Healthy Eating Index 
or modified Alternative Healthy Eating Index, and Reduced-
Salt Japanese Diet, on the risk of stroke in the included studies 
are not apparently greater than that of fruits and vegetables in 
our  meta-analysis. However, highest versus lowest number of 
healthy behaviors (including physical activity, smoking, alco-
hol, diet, etc) showed a great reduction in the risk of stroke in 
Asians (0.24 [0.11–0.54],52 0.36 [0.22–0.58] and 0.24 [0.16–
0.36],53  0.25  [0.14–0.46]),54  Europeans  (0.33  [0.14–0.46]),18 
and Americans  (0.34  [0.08–1.52],55  0.43  [0.21–0.91],56  0.31 
[0.19–0.53] and 0.21 [0.12–0.36]),57 indicating an interaction 
between healthy behaviors.

Other  limitations  should  also  be  considered.  First,  bias 
such as misclassification of exposure (fruits and vegetables), 
outcome (stroke), and confounding factors is one of the main 
threats  to  the  validity  of  the  results.  Misclassification  of 
fruits  and  vegetables  consumption  could  be  of  concern,  and 
some  participants  might  change  their  dietary  habits  during 
 follow-up. However, similar results were found in self-admin-
istered  dietary  assessment  group  and   interview-administered 
group, and invalidation study showed that the food frequency 
questionnaire  is  a  reasonable  tool  to  assess  intakes  of  fruits 
and  vegetables.58  In  addition,  nondifferential  misclassifica-
tion  at  baseline  should  have  weakened  the  association.  As 
shown in Table I in the online-only Data Supplement, all of the 
cases were ascertained by hospital records, death certificates, 
or  interviewing  their  physicians,  but  the  underlying  cases  of 
stroke might not be detected and might influence the results, 
which could be also influenced by the imprecise measurements 
of confounding factors. Second, although we extracted the RRs 
that reflected the greatest degree of control for potential con-
founders, the extent to which they were adjusted and residual 
confounding by other unmeasured factors, such as coffee59 and 
dairy foods,60 should be considered. Third, results of subgroup 
analysis  by  specific  categories  of  vegetables  and  fruits  were 
based on limited number of studies. Fourth, in a meta-analy-
sis of published studies, publication bias could be of concern 
because small studies with null results tend not to be published. 
After excluding the studies leading to small-study effect in the 
funnel  plot,  no  evidence  of  significant  publication  bias  was 
found in this meta-analysis.

In  summary,  results  from  this  meta-analysis  support  the 
hypothesis  that  consumption  of  vegetables  and  fruits  could 
reduce the risk of stroke.

None.

Green and Black Tea Consumption and Risk of Stroke

A Meta-Analysis

Lenore Arab, PhD; Weiqing Liu, MS; David Elashoff, PhD

Background and Purpose—Experimental models of stroke provide consistent evidence of smaller stroke volumes in
animals ingesting tea components or tea extracts. To assess whether a similar association of black or green tea
consumption with reduced risk is evident in human populations, we sought to identify and summarize all human clinical
and observational data on tea and stroke.

Methods—We searched PubMed and Web of Science for all studies on stroke and tea consumption in humans with original
data, including estimation or measurement of tea consumption and outcomes of fatal or nonfatal stroke. Data from 9
studies involving 4378 strokes among 194 965 individuals were pooled. The main outcome was the occurrence of fatal
or nonfatal stroke. We tested for heterogeneity and calculated the summary effect estimate associated with consumption
of ⱖ3 cups of tea (green or black) per day using random-effects and fixed-effects models for the homogeneous studies.
Publication bias was also evaluated.

Results—Regardless of their country of origin, individuals consuming ⱖ3 cups of tea per day had a 21% lower risk of
stroke than those consuming ⬍1 cup per day (absolute risk reduction, 0.79; CI, 0.73 to 0.85). The proportion of
heterogeneity not explained by chance alone was 23.8%.

Conclusions—Although a randomized clinical trial would be necessary to confirm the effect, this meta-analysis suggests
that daily consumption of either green or black tea equaling 3 cups per day could prevent the onset of ischemic stroke.
(Stroke. 2009;40:1786-1792.)

Key Words: black tea 䡲 Camelia sinensis 䡲 green tea 䡲 ischemic stroke 䡲 theophylline

Globally, cerebrovascular disease causes an estimated 5.4

million deaths per year.1 Stroke can have a profound
influence on the individual and their families.2 Survivors
frequently experience hemiparesis, aphasia, hemianopia, de-
pressive symptoms, dysphagia, incontinence, and difficulty
walking.3 Among noninstitutionalized survivors, stroke has a
significant impact on quality of life, including mental health,
physical health, and subjective perceptions of health.4 The
occurrence of stroke is estimated to be $62.7 billion in 2007
in the United States due to lost productivity, hospital and
nursing home costs, or $140 000 per victim.5 The cost of
stroke between 2005 and 2050 in the United States is
estimated to exceed $2 trillion.6

There are few known preventive strategies to date. Ciga-
rette smoking, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus are the
known actionable risk factors. In a few studies, physical activity
appeared to be associated with lower risk of stroke by approx-
imately 20%.7,8 Preventive approaches have been shown to
powerfully impact disease burden as well as costs.9,10

We have previously conducted meta-analyses of the rela-
tionship between Camelia sinensis consumption as black tea
and cardiovascular disease risk, which suggested heterogene-
ity of results and associated with an overall reduced risk.11 At

that time, little data on stroke in human populations were
available, but the available information, although inadequate
for a meta-analysis, was suggestive of an association with
reduced risk. Further evidence supportive of this hypothesis
comes from preclinical studies in which stroke was induced
in rats, mice, and gerbils. In these experiments, either
epigallocatechin gallate12–14 or tea catechin extracts were
given in doses ranging from 25 to 50 mg/kg intraperitoneally
to rats subjected to cerebral arterial occlusion. They found
reduced brain infarct area and stroke volume in an inverse
dose-dependent fashion. Where studied, neurological deficits
were found to be significantly alleviated among the rats
provided with the catechins.15 The authors of that study
concluded that “daily intake of green tea catechins efficiently
protects the penumbra from irreversible damage due to
cerebral
ischemia, and consequent neurological deficits.”
Treatment of gerbils, in which ischemia was induced by
occlusion of the right common carotid artery for 30 to 90
minutes, with 50 mg/kg epigallocatechin gallate, reduced the
formation of postischemic brain edema and infarct volume.16
Green tea extract functioned similarly in this species.14

This study was undertaken to rigorously examine the
human clinical and epidemiological data available to deter-

Green and Black Tea Consumption and Risk of Stroke

1787

mine whether, within the mix of other contributing factors,
self-selected consumption of black or green tea as an infused
hot beverage has an impact on the risk of stroke in humans.
To examine this, we conducted a systematic literature review
and meta-analysis of all unearthed human data on tea con-
sumption and stroke.

Methodology

Eligibility Criteria
Inclusion criteria were established in advance of the search. The
search strategy was set to include both clinical trials and observa-
tional epidemiological studies. No studies with original data on
stroke as a primary or secondary outcome in humans and its
association to tea consumption were excluded. Authors of studies
published on tea effects that mentioned stroke but did not provide
data were contacted to request the data necessary to include them in
the meta-analysis.

Search Strategy
To identify the studies of interest, we conducted an electronic search
of the PubMed and Web of Science databases though October 2007.
MeSH terms were used and were exploded for narrower subjects and
text words related to tea (tea, theophylline, Camelia sinensis, coffee,
coffea, or caffeine) as well as the search terms “tea,” “green tea,”
“black tea,” “flavonoids,” “Camelia sinensis,” and “stroke” (text
words included cerebrovascular accident, brain ischemia, intracranial
hemorrhages, and cerebral hemorrhage) and search terms “subarach-
noid hemorrhage,” “ischemic stroke,” “hemorrhagic stroke.” The
study was limited to human subjects. Reviews were excluded. No
language restrictions were made. A University of California at Los
Angeles research librarian (R.O.) conducted an independent search
of the same terms to ensure that the search was comprehensive. The
reference lists of the relevant articles were reviewed to identify any
citations that might be related to original human studies on stroke and
tea. In studies in which estimates were not quantified, the authors were
contacted to request the numeric estimates. The interim literature was
assessed for additional publications. One additional study was identified
in June 2008 and added to the analysis.17 The search was conducted
once more in September 2008 with 2 terms added (catechin and cerebral
infarction) to ensure comprehensiveness.

Data Reviews and Statistical Analysis
Two reviewers independently reviewed all of the resulting abstracts
for applicability (L.A. and A.W.). The titles and abstracts were
reviewed to identify those that were relevant and contained any
original data in human populations. Inconsistencies were resolved
through discussion until a consensus was reached. Data were
extracted using a standardized spreadsheet.

Relative risk or risk ratio was used as the primary effect estimate.
This meta-analysis addresses studies in which the outcome was
relative risk of stroke. The STATA (Version 10) module GSLT was
used to estimate the risk ratio and 95% confidence limits for 3 cups
per day. StatsDirect (Version 2.6.6) was used to find the fixed-effect
model estimates and random-effect model estimates for different
combinations of studies.

We assessed the presence of between-study heterogeneity in 2
main ways: by using forest plots to see how well the confidence
intervals overlap and using Hedge’s Q test.18 The test of heteroge-
neity was considered significant if P⬍0.10. The I2 index19(range, 0%
to 100%) was also calculated to measure the degree of inconsistency
in the studies’ results. It describes the percentage of variation in the
estimates of tea effect that is due to heterogeneity between the
studies.

A pooled risk ratio with 95% CIs was calculated across homoge-
neous studies. The pooled risk ratios were estimated using both
fixed- and random-effect models.20 When fixed-effect and random-
effect meta-analyses gave identical results, it is unlikely that there
was important statistical heterogeneity and the fixed-effect models

were presented as the primary outcome. If, however, results varied
across studies, the more conservative option, to use the random-
effect model estimates was undertaken.

The risk estimates used are based on the relative risk of a ⱖ3 cup
per day increase in tea consumption for most studies. For these,
inverse variance-weighted, categorical regression was used to esti-
mate linear exposure–response curves from the reported categories
of consumption using the covariance-corrected method of Greenland
and Longnecker as reported previously.21 STATA Version 10 GSLT
was used to estimate the risk ratios and confidence limits for 3 cups
per day across the reported dose levels. StatsDirect Version 2.6.6
was used to determine estimates from both fixed- and random-effects
models for different combinations of studies.

Exposure values, in cups per day, were estimated for the tea
consumption categories in the original studies as described in our
earlier publication.11 In brief, if medians or means were available for
the tea consumption categories, they were used. Otherwise, category
midranges were applied, and for open-ended response levels, 1.2
times the previous category was applied with one exception in
which, because of skewness a factor, 1.4 times the lower boundary
was applied.

Subgroup analyses were also performed according to the type of
tea (green/black), study type (cohort only), and the study countries
(Asian/non-Asian). Publication bias was evaluated using the funnel
the Egger regression method,22 and the rank correlation
graph,
method of Begg.23

To investigate the impact of various study characteristics on the
study estimates of risk ratio, metaregression analysis was conducted.
The natural logarithm of the risk ratio was the dependent variable;
the number of participants, the number of cancer cases, the type of
tea, and the geographic location were explanatory factors. Weighted
linear regression analysis was conducted weighted to the inverse of
the variance of the logarithm of the risk ratio. Univariable linear
regression was run for each factor first. Then, all factors were
included for a multivariable regression with a backward stepwise
approach to select the significant ones.

All tests were conducted without prior assumption of a protective
effect and thus were 2-tailed. The meta-analysis was performed
using Statsdirect Statistical Software Version 2.6.6.24

Results

The search through PubMed yielded 59 citations, including
one in Chinese that was translated by a Chinese national
(W.L.). Screening of these citations for original human studies
resulted in the identification of 11 studies; 8 cohorts, 2 case–
controls, and one cross-sectional study that could provide
original data on some type of stroke in relationship to tea
consumption. A few studies were identified that associated
flavonoid intake with stroke but did not have separate estimates
for tea consumption and were therefore not included.

Ten studies from 6 different countries contributed to the
meta-analysis: China, Japan, Finland, The Netherlands, Aus-
tralia, and the United States. Mortality from stroke among 35-
to 74-year-old men in these countries ranged from a low of 30
per 100 000 in Australia to a high of 243 per 100 000 men
living in rural China. Finland and Japan had intermediary
mortality rates of 54 and 66, respectively.5 The end points for
the study included and combined both fatal and nonfatal
stroke. All of the cohorts provided stroke mortality data to
which the cohort studies of Hirvonen25 and Keli26 also
included nonfatal strokes. The case– control and cross-
sectional studies included incidence and prevalence of stroke.
Many of the studies had risk estimates for total strokes and
one or more breakdowns for ischemic stroke, cerebral hem-
orrhage, or subarachnoid hemorrhage. One study27 included
only subjects with an intracerebral hemorrhage and another

only included subarachnoid hemorrhage.28 Because these are
minority subsets of total stroke incidence, neither study was
included in the meta-analysis, leaving only one case– control
study in the analysis.

Three of the studies included only women and 3 only men.
For 3 studies, the effect estimates were presented only as
combined across both gender groups. One study presented
risk estimates separately for men and women. In that case,
both estimates were included separately in the analyses. Some of
the studies excluded smokers; others attempted to control for
smoking in the analyses. These studies included 7 populations
that drank primarily or exclusively black tea and 3 that drank
primarily green tea. The studies are presented in Table 1.

As seen in the table and the summary meta-analysis plot
presented as Figure 1, all of the eligible studies had risk point
estimates ⬍1.0. The fixed- and random-effect model esti-
mates from the meta-analyses were extremely similar and
both are presented. Although there are a relatively small
number of studies identified, and none of them were clinical
trials testing the effect of tea, the meta-analytic model was
quite robust. The confidence intervals were narrow and there
was no significant heterogeneity. The Q value for the meta-
analysis involving 10 studies was 11.8. The I2 for the 10
studies in total was 23.8%. There was surprisingly no
indication of significant publication bias on the topic, al-
though an outlier can be seen in the funnel plot presented in
Figure 1. The Forrest plot for these 10 studies along with the
meta-analytic results are presented in Figure 2.

This meta-analysis combines different stroke end points,
different types of tea consumption, and different study types.

To see if more homogeneous combinations came to different
analyses, we conducted the meta-analysis in 5 subsets. The
set of studies that
included only green tea consumption
included only 3 studies, and this combination of studies
showed significant heterogeneity (P⫽0.193). A subset of
Asian-only analyses in which black tea estimates were
included was not significantly heterogeneous. The overall
results from these subgroup analyses showed effect estimates
that were all very similar to the overall effect estimate. That
is, the strong association of tea consumption with reduced
risk could not be attributed to an effect in Asians more than
non-Asians or green tea consumers more than black tea
consumers. The confidence intervals, even for the random-
effect models, were all ⬍1.0, and the ranges, 0.64 to 0.94
seen in Table 2, were statistically significant.

Discussion

Despite different drinking customs and a broad range in risk
of death due to stroke, across the 6 countries studied, a
consistent association is found. The pooled meta-analyses
show tea consumption to be associated with reduced risk for
occurrence of and mortality from stroke. Subjects drinking
ⱖ3 cups of tea per day appear to reduce risk of a fatal or
nonfatal stroke by approximately 21% as compared with
nondrinkers of tea. The effect does not appear to be specific
to green or black tea or to Asian or non-Asian populations.
These findings suggest that tea drinking may be one of the
most actionable lifestyle changes to significantly reduce the
risk of stroke.

Figure 1. Funnel plot of studies of stroke and tea consumption.

The term “stroke” is used in this article despite its
imprecision, because it was the outcome most commonly
reported on in the epidemiological literature. More desirable
would be the incorporation of a more exact diagnosis of the
stroke subtype and mechanism (small versus large vessel,
secondary to atheroma or dissection) based on brain imaging
results as currently recommended,29 which would allow a
better understanding of the mechanism of action. However,
this is not available currently in population-based studies. In
the Western world, the majority of strokes are caused by
cerebral ischemia; in Asia, they have historically been more
commonly hemorrhagic in origin.

Our meta-analysis is consistent with animal research dem-
onstrating that active ingredients in Camelia sinensis can
reduce the damage associated with cerebrovascular accidents
cited at the beginning of this article. It is also consistent with
earlier findings of an association with reduced risk among
drinkers of black tea on cardiovascular disease risk in general,
although the findings from those studies were highly hetero-
geneous. In contrast, these stroke findings are remarkably
homogeneous, suggesting a more consistent effect, a more
homogeneous condition, and perhaps fewer competing mech-
anisms contributing to the etiology.

The results are consistent across green and black tea.
Although, due to their processing difference, the types of
catechins differ between green and black tea;
their total
amounts are comparable because both black and green tea are
derived from the same source: the catechins produced within
the Camelia sinensis plant.30 The findings presented may
seem surprisingly consistent across green and black tea, but
both have demonstrated effects on vascular function.31,32

This meta-analysis is potentially limited by the small
number of studies. However, the total observational pool
encompassed 194 965 individuals and 4378 stroke events.

Furthermore, because the weight of the meta-analysis stems
from the cohort studies, there is little cause for concern that
recall bias may be contributing to the findings. However,
there is random measurement error inherent in measurement
of the exposure of interest, cups of tea. Ideally, dry tea matter
would be assessed and the differences in tea concentration in
different countries taken into account. When we have gone to
those lengths in a study of tea, the risk estimates became
stronger.33

As always the case in meta-analyses,

the results are
susceptible to publication bias such that studies showing an
effect are more likely to be published. However, in most of
the epidemiological studies, unlike the cited animal studies,
stroke was not the primary outcome of interest. The studies
addressed total mortality or cardiovascular disease mortality
or incidence in relation to tea consumption. Because of this,
there is a lower likelihood of publication bias regarding the
stroke events if not the primary events. In fact, 5 of the
contributing studies showed nonsignificant relationships be-
tween tea consumption and stroke, 3 of which had very large
confidence intervals.

Ideally, stroke as an outcome would be separated into
different subcategories without combining ischemic stroke
and hemorrhagic stroke. This would be particularly inter-
esting because animal evidence suggests that tea consump-
tion may reduce the damage of
ischemic stroke but
increase the risk of hemorrhagic.16 However, most of the
studies combine all strokes, and the few addressing strictly
subarachnoid hemorrhage and hemorrhagic stroke are too
limited to meta-analyze. Furthermore, the 3 studies that
break out nonischemic stroke have too few cases to
provide robust estimates. Two of
these were Finnish
studies, one17 of which had 267 ischemic strokes and only
41 hemorrhagic strokes; in the other study,25 only 95 of the

Figure 2. Forest plot of studies of stroke and tea consumption.

831 stroke events were hemorrhagic. The third study was
in a Japanese population34 in which only 34 of the 145
stroke deaths were reported to be hemorrhagic. In each
case, the risk ratios for hemorrhagic stroke were close to
1.0. Thus, the overriding association is likely to be due
primarily to the effect of tea on ischemic stroke. Ischemic
stroke is 10 times more frequent than intracerebral hem-
orrhage and 30 times more frequent than subarachnoid
hemorrhage among 85 year olds in the United States.35
Although hemorrhagic stroke has traditionally been more

frequently experienced in Asia, ischemic stroke is also a
major problem there as evidenced by the low number of
hemorrhagic strokes in Japan.

The mechanism of action by which tea may protect against
stroke remains speculative. Although antioxidant functions
and anti-inflammatory actions are often mentioned, 3 mech-
anisms have some in vivo evidence of effect or lack of it. One
is the relationship between black and green tea and blood
pressure. Both types of tea have been shown to reduce blood
pressure in stroke-prone hypertensive rats at doses equivalent

to 1 L per day in humans.36 Blood pressure control is the
primary strategy to limit risk of stroke in humans. However,
population-based analyses do not support a generalized neg-
ative association between tea consumption and blood
pressure.37

A second mechanism is through an impact of tea or
catechin consumption on nitric oxide formation.38 Catechin
ingestion blocked an increase in serum nitric oxide concen-
tration in rats after reperfusion and tea has a demonstrated
effect on endothelial function. Ingested tea can also enhance
endothelial function, especially among those with compro-
mised functionality.32,39 Because cerebral blood flow is par-
ticularly impaired in elderly with reduced endothelial func-
tion, and vascularization of the brain impacts stroke risk, this
is a possible mechanism.40

The third possibility is through effects of theanine, an
amino acid in high concentrations in and coming almost
exclusively from the tea plant. Theanine is readily bioavail-
able from both green and black tea, crosses the blood– brain
barrier, and has demonstrated effects on brain function.41 The
chemical structure of theanine, which contains the glutamate
molecule, suggests that it might reduce glutamate-related
endothelial damage. Studies of middle cerebral artery occlu-
sion in mice have demonstrated a neuroprotective effect of
␥-glutamylethylamide (theanine) and at dosages of 05 and
1.0 mg/kg, it reduces the size of the cerebral infarct in the
gerbil. In this model, functional ␥-aminobutyric acidA
receptors, present only in the brain, appear to be respon-
sive to theanine.42

An alternative hypothesis, supported by the experiments
with induced focal ischemia, is that regular tea consumption,
instead of preventing overt stroke, may instead reduce the
postischemic damage to a level that results in subclinical
ischemia or hidden strokes. This would result in the diagnosis
of stroke only in individuals with more extensive postische-
mic damage or a greater stroke volume.

In conclusion, the observational epidemiological research
in humans is strongly supportive of the hypothesis that tea
consumption, at the level of ⱖ3 cups per day, either as green
or black tea, reduces the risk of occurrence of stroke, stroke
volume, and mortality from stroke.

Intake of carbohydrates compared with intake of saturated fatty acids
and risk of myocardial infarction: importance of the glycemic index1–3

Marianne U Jakobsen, Claus Dethlefsen, Albert M Joensen, Jakob Stegger, Anne Tjønneland, Erik B Schmidt,
and Kim Overvad

ABSTRACT
Background: Studies have suggested that replacing saturated fatty
acids (SFAs) with carbohydrates is modestly associated with a high-
er risk of ischemic heart disease, whereas replacing SFAs with
polyunsaturated fatty acids is associated with a lower risk of ische-
mic heart disease. The effect of carbohydrates, however, may de-
pend on the type consumed.
Objectives: By using substitution models, we aimed to investigate
the risk of myocardial infarction (MI) associated with a higher en-
ergy intake from carbohydrates and a concomitant lower energy
intake from SFAs. Carbohydrates with different glycemic index
(GI) values were also investigated.
Design: Our prospective cohort study included 53,644 women and
men free of MI at baseline.
Results: During a median of 12 y of follow-up, 1943 incident MI
cases occurred. There was a nonsigniﬁcant inverse association be-
tween substitution of carbohydrates with low-GI values for SFAs
and risk of MI [hazard ratio (HR) for MI per 5% increment of
energy intake from carbohydrates: 0.88; 95% CI: 0.72, 1.07). In
contrast, there was a statistically signiﬁcant positive association
between substitution of carbohydrates with high-GI values for SFAs
and risk of MI (HR: 1.33; 95% CI: 1.08, 1.64). There was no
association for carbohydrates with medium-GI values (HR: 0.98;
95% CI: 0.80, 1.21). No effect modiﬁcation by sex was observed.
Conclusion: This study suggests that replacing SFAs with carbohy-
drates with low-GI values is associated with a lower risk of MI,
whereas replacing SFAs with carbohydrates with high-GI values is

INTRODUCTION

Epidemiologic prospective cohort studies have suggested that
replacing saturated fatty acids (SFAs) with carbohydrates is
modestly associated with a higher risk of ischemic heart disease
(IHD), whereas replacing SFAs with polyunsaturated fatty acids
is associated with a lower risk of IHD (1). The effect of car-
bohydrates, however, may depend on the type consumed.

Epidemiologic prospective cohort studies have shown a posi-
tive association between dietary glycemic index (GI) and risk of
IHD (2). The dietary GI is an indicator of the average quality of the
carbohydrates consumed in terms of glycemic response. The GI,
which was conceived to provide a classiﬁcation of carbohydrate-
containing foods on the basis of their ability to raise blood glu-
cose, was introduced by Jenkins et al (3) in 1981. Blood glucose

concentration is tightly regulated by homeostatic regulatory
systems, but the rapid absorption of carbohydrates after con-
sumption of a high-GI meal challenges these homeostatic
mechanisms (4). A high-GI meal results in a high blood glucose
concentration and a high insulin-to-glucagon ratio, followed by
hypoglycemia, counterregulatory hormone secretion, and ele-
vated plasma free fatty acid concentration (4). These events may
affect the risk of IHD through promoting dyslipidemia, in-
ﬂammation, and endothelial dysfunction (4).

The aim of this study was to investigate the risk of myocardial
infarction (MI) with a higher energy intake from carbohydrates
and a concomitant lower energy intake from SFAs. Carbohydrates
with different GI values were investigated. Furthermore, potential
effect modiﬁcation by sex was investigated because of differences
in the underlying biology such as hormonal differences.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS

vitation, a validated 192-item semiquantitative food-frequency
questionnaire (FFQ) was enclosed (5, 6). At the study center,
participants ﬁlled in a lifestyle questionnaire, and a physical
examination was conducted. The self-administered ques-
tionnaires were scanned and interviewer-checked by laboratory
technicians. In total, 57,053 persons were recruited (35%). A
detailed description of the study design and measurement pro-
cedures has been given by Tjønneland et al (7).

Diet and behavior variables

The 192-item semiquantitative FFQ was designed for the
present study (5) and validated against two 7-d weighed diet
records (6). The participants were asked to report their average
intake of different food and beverage items over the past year
within 12 possible categories, which ranged from “never” to “8
times or more per day.” Calculation of daily nutrient intake
averages was done by the software program FoodCalc (http://
www.ibt.ku.dk/jesper/foodcalc), which is based on Danish food
composition tables (8). Derived exposure measures were gly-
cemic carbohydrates (total carbohydrates minus ﬁber, ie, avail-
able carbohydrates) expressed as percentage of total energy
intake (% energy; not including energy intake from alcohol). A
GI database was compiled by using published GI values. For each
person, the average dietary GI was calculated by summing the
products of the quantity of a given food item consumed (g/d), by
the glycemic carbohydrate content of that food (ie, by the pro-
portion of glycemic carbohydrates), and by its GI value, which
was divided by the total glycemic carbohydrate intake (g/d) (9).
GI was expressed as a percentage of the blood glucose response
with the use of white bread as the reference food.

Information on education, smoking status, and leisure-time
physical activity was obtained from the lifestyle questionnaire.
Length of education was reported in predeﬁned categories (,8,
8–10, and .10 y). Smoking status was reported as “never,”
“former,” or “current”; duration of smoking in years; and the
number of cigarettes, cigars, cheroots (a type of cigar), and to-
bacco pipes smoked per day. Current tobacco consumption was
calculated in grams per day by using conversion factors of 1.0
for cigarettes, 4.5 for cigars, and 3.0 for cheroots and tobacco
pipes. Leisure-time physical activity over the past year was re-
ported as the number of hours per week engaged in walking,
biking, gardening, housework, do-it-yourself work, and sports
during summer and winter. Leisure-time physical activity was
calculated as hours per week spent on biking and sports.

Anthropometric and clinical variables

Height and weight were measured at the physical examination.
Body mass index (BMI) was calculated as weight in kilograms
divided by height in meters squared (kg/m2) and categorized as
BMI of ,25, 25–29, and 30. Information on a history of hy-
pertension and diabetes mellitus was obtained from the lifestyle
questionnaire. History of hypertension was deﬁned as reported
hypertension and/or use of antihypertensive medication.

Identiﬁcation of cases

The outcome measure was incident nonfatal and fatal MI.
Information on the outcome measure was obtained by linkage
with central Danish registries via the unique identiﬁcation

number assigned to all Danish citizens (10). We identiﬁed all
participants registered with a ﬁrst-time discharge diagnosis of MI
or cardiac arrest (International Classiﬁcation of Diseases, 8th
revision, codes 410–410.99 and 427.27, and International
Classiﬁcation of Diseases, 10th revision, codes I21.0-I21.9 and
I46.0-I46.9) in the Danish National Patient Registry (11) from
the date of enrollment into the Diet, Cancer, and Health study
until 31 December 2003. Medical records were retrieved and
reviewed, and patients were classiﬁed according to symptoms,
coronary biomarkers, electrocardiogram, and/or autopsy ﬁnd-
ings in accordance with the criteria of MI as recommended by
the American Heart Association and other major health organ-
izations for use in epidemiologic studies (12). Only patients that
fulﬁlled the criteria of MI were included as cases. The positive
predictive values of MI and cardiac arrest caused by MI in the
Danish National Patient Registry were 81.9% (95% CI: 79.5,
84.2) and 50.0% (95% CI: 34.2, 65.8), respectively (13). By
stratifying on the type of department of discharge, the positive
predictive values were 92.4% (95% CI: 90.4, 94.0) for patients
diagnosed with a MI in a ward and 26.0% (95% CI: 19.6, 33.3)
for patients diagnosed with a MI in an emergency room or in an
outpatient clinic (13). From 1 January 2004 and onward, we
used register information and restricted the case deﬁnition to
patients with MI discharged from wards and patients with a di-
agnosis of cardiac arrest and veriﬁed MI. Furthermore, partic-
ipants registered with MI or cardiac arrest as cause of death in
the Causes of Death Register (14) were included as cases.

Exclusion criteria

Persons with a cancer diagnosis that was not at the time of
invitation registered in the Danish Cancer Registry (due to
processing delay) were later excluded. Furthermore, persons with
incomplete questionnaires were excluded. Finally, persons reg-
istered with a diagnosis of MI or cardiac arrest and persons
registered with a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus or self-reported
diabetes mellitus before enrollment were also excluded. The
rationale for exclusion of persons with diabetes mellitus was
potential effect modiﬁcation and potential changes in dietary
habits as a result of diagnosis and treatment.

Statistical analyses

Analyses were carried out among all participants and sepa-
rately for women and men. Hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% CIs for
the incidence of MI were calculated by using the Cox pro-
portional hazards regression with age as the time metric to ensure
that the estimation procedure was based on comparisons of
participants at the same age. The observation time for each
participant was the period from the date of enrollment in the Diet,
Cancer, and Health study (between December 1993 and May
1997) to the date of a registered diagnosis of MI or cardiac arrest
caused by MI, death from another cause, emigration, or 27 April
2008 (the Cause of Death Register until 31 December 2006),
whichever came ﬁrst.

Two models were used for investigation of the risk of MI with
a higher energy intake from carbohydrates and a concomitant
lower energy intake from SFAs. Model 1 included intake of
carbohydrates, proteins, monounsaturated fatty acids, and
polyunsaturated fatty acids expressed as percentages of total
energy intake,

variables), an indicator variable for alcohol consumption (0 and
.0 g/d), and alcohol consumption (g/d). Adjustment of alcohol
consumption was expanded beyond simple linear or categorical
approaches to include ﬂexible curves via restricted cubic splines
that make use of within-category risk variation (15). Model 2
included variables in model 1 and BMI (,25, 25–29, and 30),
education (,8, 8–10, and .10 y), smoking status (“never,”
“former,” and “currently smoking” 1–14, 15–24, or 25 g to-
bacco/d), leisure-time physical activity (,3.5 and 3.5 h/wk),
and history of hypertension (“yes,” “no,” and “do not know”). In
analyses among all participants, sex was entered into the model
through the strata statement. The estimated HRs for carbohy-
drates may be interpreted as the estimated differences in risk for
a 5% higher energy intake from carbohydrates and a concomi-
tant lower energy intake from SFAs, ie, substitution of 5% of
energy intake from carbohydrates for 5% of energy intake from
SFAs. In further analyses, the type of carbohydrate was taken
into account by investigating carbohydrates with different GI
values. We calculated tertiles of dietary GI based on the distri-
bution of dietary GI among cases. The estimated HRs may be
interpreted as the estimated difference in risk for a 5% higher
energy intake from carbohydrates and a concomitant lower en-
ergy intake from SFAs among persons who consume carbohy-
drates with low-GI values (ie, substitution of 5% of energy
intake from carbohydrates with low-GI values for 5% of energy
intake from SFAs) (ﬁrst tertile), medium-GI values (ie, sub-
stitution of 5% of energy intake from carbohydrates with
medium-GI values for 5% of energy intake from SFAs) (second
tertile), or high-GI values (ie, substitution of 5% of energy in-
take from carbohydrates with high-GI values for 5% of energy
intake from SFAs) (third tertile).

Effect modiﬁcation was tested on the multiplicative scale by
a likelihood-ratio test of nested models with and without cross-
product terms. We tested the continuous variables for non-
linearity in restricted cubic spline regression models and used

a log-rank test based on Schoenfeld residuals to assess the
proportional-hazards assumption. No violations were detected.
Data analyses were performed by using Stata statistical software,

Among the 57,053 women and men recruited, 569 persons
with a cancer diagnosis that was not at the time of invitation
registered in the Danish Cancer Registry (due to processing
delay) were later excluded. Three persons were excluded because
they wanted to be omitted from further studies based on data from
the Diet, Cancer, and Health study. Among the remaining 56,481
participants, persons with incomplete questionnaires (n = 646)
were excluded. Furthermore, persons with a diagnosis of MI
(n = 899) or diabetes mellitus (n = 1292) before enrollment were
also excluded. The ﬁnal population consisted of 53,644 persons
(53% women). Baseline characteristics are shown in Table 1.
Among women and men, the median age was 56 y (80% central
range: 51–63), the median intake of carbohydrates was 45%
energy (80% central range: 38–52), and the median dietary GI
was 87 (80% central range: 80–94) (Table 1).

During a median of follow-up of 12 y, 1943 incident cases of
MI (537 among women and 1406 among men) were identiﬁed.
HRs and 95% CIs for MI for a 5% higher energy intake from
carbohydrates and a concomitant lower energy intake from SFAs
are shown in Table 2. HRs and 95% CIs for MI for a 5% higher
energy intake from carbohydrates with low-, medium-, or high-
GI values and a concomitant lower energy intake from SFAs are
shown in Table 3. Among women and men, substitution of
carbohydrates for SFAs was not associated with risk of MI (HR:
1.04; 95% CI: 0.92, 1.17) (Table 2). The P value for effect
modiﬁcation by sex was 0.21. However,
there was a non-
signiﬁcant inverse association between substitution of carbohy-
drates with low-GI values for SFAs and risk of MI (HR in the

all participants, n = 28,495 for women, and n = 25,149 for men.

2 Model 1 included intake of glycemic carbohydrates, proteins, mono-
unsaturated fatty acids, and polyunsaturated fatty acids expressed as percen-
tages of total energy intake, total energy intake (kcal/d), an indicator variable
for alcohol consumption (0 and .0 g/d), and alcohol consumption (g/d).
Hazard ratios with 95% CIs for the incidence of myocardial infarction were
calculated by using Cox proportional hazards regression with age as the time
metric. In analyses among all participants, sex was entered into the model.
3 Model 2 included variables in model 1 and BMI (in kg/m2; ,25, 25–
29, and 30), education (,8, 8–10, and .10 y), smoking status (never,
former, and currently smoking 1–14, 15–24, or 25 g tobacco/d), physical
activity (,3.5 and 3.5 h/wk), and history of hypertension (yes, no, and do
not know).

tistically signiﬁcant positive association between substitution of
carbohydrates with high-GI values for SFAs and risk of MI (HR
in the third tertile of dietary GI: 1.33; 95% CI: 1.08, 1.64) (Table
3). There was no association for carbohydrates with medium-GI
values (HR in the second tertile of dietary GI: 0.98; 95% CI:
0.80, 1.21) (Table 3). As assessed from the 95% CIs,
the
measures of associations for extreme tertiles of GI were statis-
tically signiﬁcantly different. The P value for effect modiﬁcation
by tertiles of dietary GI was 0.06 in women, 0.29 in men, and
0.16 in all participants. The P value for effect modiﬁcation by
sex was 0.86.

DISCUSSION

The ﬁndings from this study suggest that the effect of sub-
stitution of carbohydrates for SFAs varies depending on the type of
inverse association
carbohydrates. There was a nonsigniﬁcant

between substitution of carbohydrates with low-GI values for SFAs
and risk of MI but a signiﬁcant positive association between
substitution of carbohydrates with high-GI values for SFAs and risk
of MI. In this study, dietary GI was used as an indicator of the
average quality of carbohydrates consumed, but other classi-
ﬁcations of carbohydrates may also be relevant, such as the extent
of processing, which also reﬂects the intake of dietary ﬁber (16, 17).
Selection bias is unlikely to have affected the results. However,
if censoring due to death from other causes is associated with
intake of carbohydrates and risk of MI, then the true associations
between intake of carbohydrates and risk of MI may have been
underestimated. Random measurement error cannot be excluded
from having affected the results. A potential source of random
measurement error arises from dietary self-reporting methods.
Generally, random measurement error leads to underestimation
of the true risk and to loss of statistical power. However, dietary
intake was determined by using a FFQ, which may reﬂect the
habitual eating pattern. Information bias is unlikely to have af-
fected the results because cases were identiﬁed by record linkage
with central Danish registries and diagnoses were established
independently of the FFQs of the participants. We included car-
bohydrates, proteins, monounsaturated fatty acids, and poly-
unsaturated fatty acids expressed as percentages of the total energy
intake and the total energy intake in the models because of po-
tential confounding and extraneous variation. This also allowed us
to estimate the difference in the risk for a higher energy intake from
carbohydrates and a concomitant lower energy intake from SFAs.
Relevant control for established risk factors for IHD did not change
the measures of associations, and thus residual confounding seems
unlikely. However, confounding from other IHD risk factors not
taken into account remains a possible explanation for the observed
associations.

Only 2 epidemiologic studies have investigated the sub-
stitution of carbohydrates for SFAs (1, 18). In the prospective
cohort study by Hu et al (18), substitution of carbohydrates for
SFAs was nonsigniﬁcantly associated with a lower risk of IHD,
whereas in the prospective cohort study by Jakobsen et al (1), in
which data from 11 American and European cohort studies were
pooled, substitution of carbohydrates for SFAs was modestly

associated with a higher risk of IHD. The inconsistent ﬁndings
may be due to differences in the quality of carbohydrates, which
was not taken into account in these previous studies. Findings in
this study suggested that replacing SFAs with carbohydrates with
low-GI values is associated with a lower risk of MI, whereas
replacing SFAs with carbohydrates with high-GI values is as-
sociated with a higher risk of MI. A high-GI meal results in a high
blood glucose concentration and a high insulin-to-glucagon ratio,
followed by hypoglycemia, counterregulatory hormone secre-
tion, and elevated plasma free fatty acid concentration (4). These
events may affect the risk of IHD through promoting dyslipi-
demia, inﬂammation, and endothelial dysfunction (4). In the
Nurses’ Health Study, a nonsigniﬁcant positive association be-
tween dietary GI and risk of IHD was found (19). Furthermore, in
a prospective cohort study in men (20) and in a case-control study
in women and men (21), nonsigniﬁcant positive associations
between dietary GI and MI were found.

The associations between substitution of carbohydrates for
SFAs and risk of MI may be modiﬁed by sex due to differences in
the underlying biology, such as hormonal differences. This study,
however, suggests that, to prevent MI, the type of carbohydrates
should be considered among middle-aged women and men.

The classiﬁcation of carbohydrate-containing foods on the
basis of their ability to raise blood glucose has been shown to
have clinical relevance (2, 4), but the public health application is
not straightforward. However, recommendations of food choices
such as less-reﬁned foods, nonstarchy vegetables, fruit, and
legumes may promote dietary patterns with a low dietary GI.
Indeed, these recommendations would also tend to promote
dietary patterns high in ﬁber and micronutrients, dietary factors
also considered to play a role in the prevention of IHD (22).

In conclusion, this study suggests that replacing SFAs with
carbohydrates with low-GI values is associated with a lower risk
of MI, whereas replacing SFAs with carbohydrates with high-GI
values is associated with a higher risk of MI.

Then and Now

Global nutrition transition and the pandemic of obesity in
developing countries

Barry M Popkin, Linda S Adair, and Shu Wen Ng

Decades ago, discussion of an impending global pandemic of obesity was thought
of as heresy. But in the 1970s, diets began to shift towards increased reliance upon
processed foods, increased away-from-home food intake, and increased use of
edible oils and sugar-sweetened beverages. Reductions in physical activity and
increases in sedentary behavior began to be seen as well. The negative eﬀects of
these changes began to be recognized in the early 1990s, primarily in low- and
middle-income populations, but they did not become clearly acknowledged until
diabetes, hypertension, and obesity began to dominate the globe. Now, rapid
increases in the rates of obesity and overweight are widely documented, from urban
and rural areas in the poorest countries of sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia to
populations in countries with higher income levels. Concurrent rapid shifts in diet
and activity are well documented as well. An array of large-scale programmatic and
policy measures are being explored in a few countries; however, few countries are
engaged in serious eﬀorts to prevent the serious dietary challenges being faced.

INTRODUCTION

Several decades ago, it was heresy to talk about an
impending global pandemic of obesity. However, diets
and activity patterns were clearly changing drastically in
the United States, and by the 1980s it was understood that
dietary quality in the United States was worsening, physi-
cal activity was drastically declining, and obesity was
rising across the United States and Europe. At that point,
only the United States was considered to have an obesity
problem, with more than half of adults in some age-,
gender-, race-, or ethnic-speciﬁc subpopulations being
overweight or obese. Home economics was dying as a
taught art in US schools, consumption of processed food
and prepared meals was increasingly common, eating
away from home, particularly in fast food restaurants, was
becoming a major part of many people’s lives, and
concern about a wider array of health conditions related
to obesity was increasing. In reviewing the early publica-
tions on the nutrition transition published in Nutrition

Reviews, several key themes were found1,2: urbanization
was a major driving force in global obesity, and over-
weight and obesity were emerging in low- and middle-
income countries. Changes in edible oil production had
created cheap vegetable oils that allowed people in low-
and middle-income countries to increase their energy
consumption at very low levels of income.1 However, at
that point in history, it was assumed that global hunger
and malnutrition were the dominant concerns in low-
and middle-income countries; it was thus very diﬃcult to
draw attention to the important roles being played by
shifts in diet and physical activity, which were increasing
the threat of obesity in these settings.

Over the past several decades, a dramatic shift has
occurred, in stages, regarding the way the entire global
population eats, drinks, and moves, and these changes
have clashed with human biology to create major changes
in body composition. The primary mismatches between
human biology and modern society that we have identi-
ﬁed in our research are highlighted in Table 1.3–12

Data from references 3–12.

In 2008, overweight and obesity were estimated to
aﬄict nearly 1.5 billion adults worldwide. One estimate,
which a recent analysis of new data shows is an underes-
timate, predicted that in 2030 an estimated 2.16 billion
adults worldwide will be overweight and 1.12 billion will
be obese.13 Below, trends data are provided from repeated
surveys conducted over the 1990–2010 period in over 40
countries using the same methods; these data suggest that
2 or more billion people are possibly already overweight
or obese today. The implications of these trends for
health, quality of life, productivity, and healthcare costs
are staggering. The burden is greater for much of Asia,
Latin America, the Middle East, and Africa due to diﬀer-
ences in fat patterning and body composition and the
cardiometabolic eﬀects of body mass index (BMI) at
levels far below the standard BMI cutoﬀ of 25 for over-
weight.14,15 For example, these results are seen in India in
relation to the prevalence of diabetes and impaired
fasting glucose and in China in the prevalence of hyper-
tension and diabetes.

This review documents the changes that have been
and are occurring in global obesity and describes what
some countries are doing in response; a focus is placed on
the potential options being considered by low- and
middle-income countries. This review also provides a
comprehensive examination of the current state of the
science on the diet-related changes occurring in the low-
and middle-income countries of the world.

OBESITY IN LOW- AND MIDDLE-INCOME COUNTRIES

Recent studies have used data from a large number of
countries to estimate current prevalence rates and to
project increases in obesity in all regions of the world.13,16
However, little detailed information exists on longitudi-
nal trends for low- and middle-income countries, aside
from Brazil, China, India, and Mexico.17,18 In addition,
none of the recent studies have focused on within-
country trends related to urban-rural or income/wealth
diﬀerences. The general impression has been that in

higher-income countries greater obesity rates are often
found in rural areas and among the poor, which is the
reverse of what
is seen in lower-income countries.
However, new evidence suggests that these patterns are
changing, and the increasing rate of obesity among the
poor has important implications for the distribution of
health inequalities.19 In the past three decades, the age-
standardized mean BMI, the most widely used metric for
deﬁning overweight and obesity, has increased by 0.4–0.5
kilograms/meter2/year.13

The major gaps in this literature relate to lack of data
and superﬁcial examinations of patterns and trends
without suﬃcient attention to the extant literature and the
dynamics of change, rather than simplistic cross-sectional
perspectives.For example,in recent papers,Subramanium
et al.,16 using just one wave of data and ignoring dynamics,
point out that the rich are far more likely than the poor to
be obese. This is a very diﬀerent conclusion from that
reached by Jones-Smith et al.,20,21 who use similar data but
longitudinal analysis. Jones-Smith et al. studied repeated
cross-sectional data from women between the ages of 18
and 49 years in 37 developing countries to assess within-
country trends in overweight/obesity inequalities by
socioeconomic status (SES) between 1989 and 2007
(n = 405,550). Meta-regression was used to examine the
associations between gross domestic product (GDP) and
disproportionate increases in overweight prevalence by
SES with additional testing for modiﬁcation by country-
level income inequality. In 27 of 37 countries, higher SES
(versus lower) was associated with higher gains in over-
weight prevalence; in the remaining 10 countries, lower
SES (versus higher) was associated with higher gains in
overweight prevalence. GDP was positively related to a
faster increase in overweight prevalence among the lower
wealth groups.Among countries with a higher GDP,lower
income inequality was associated with faster growth in
overweight prevalence among the poor.

Another limitation of current research is the focus on
women of childbearing age and preschoolers.This reﬂects
the availability of data from multiple countries that have
relied on demographic and health surveys,which focus on
women of childbearing age and their children. A few
studies, particularly some national surveys from Mexico
and Brazil and a few large-scale longitudinal studies
including the China Health and Nutrition Survey, the
Indonesia Family Life Survey, and the Mexico Family Life
Survey, cover all age and gender groups.19 Using inclusive
data, one sees quite diﬀerent gender-speciﬁc patterns of
change and diﬀerentials by SES. According to the limited
research and data available, men with higher SES have
higher rates of overweight and obesity than men with
lower SES.22 These ﬁgures for men contrast with the
trends found among women as highlighted by the two
Jones-Smith et al. papers described above.20,21

While we know obesity prevalence appears to be
rising across all low- and middle-income countries, it is
not clear what urban-rural diﬀerence may exist. This
review brings together some comprehensive data that
were recently published elsewhere.19,20 These data are
from repeated nationally representative cross-sectional
surveys of 441,916 rural and 364,267 urban (806,183
total) adult women (18–49 years old) from 42 countries
in Asia, the Middle East, Africa (East, West, central, and
southern), and Latin America. The absolute and relative
changes in prevalence of overweight and obesity for
women in these countries and regions are shown in the
supporting information for this article available online as
Table S1. The combined prevalence of overweight and
obesity (overweight = BMI ⱖ 25, obesity = BMI ⱖ 30;
called overweight/obesity hereafter), grew for all 42 coun-
tries at about 0.7 percentage points per year on average.
Using population weights, it is estimated that 19% of rural
women and 37.2% of urban women are overweight or
obese.

Urban versus rural diﬀerences and the shifting burden
of obesity toward the poor

Figure 1 and Figure S1 in the supporting information
online summarize the weighted absolute annual change

and relative annual change in the prevalence of
overweight/obesity and obesity only, respectively, among
rural versus urban women by region. On average, urban
women have higher baseline prevalence and larger
increases in prevalence of overweight/obesity compared
to rural women in the 42 countries surveyed (0.8 versus
0.5 percentage points for overweight; 0.4 versus 0.2 per-
centage points for obesity). However, there are regional
diﬀerences, with rural women in Latin America, the
Middle East, and North Africa having much higher
increases in prevalence compared to their urban counter-
parts. The relative annual change in weighted prevalence
is higher for rural (3.9%) than urban (2.5%) women. In
other words, women in rural areas are quickly catching
up to their urban counterparts. Figure S1 (available in the
supporting information online) shows the statistics for
obesity prevalence, and the results are consistent. The
higher relative annual rates of change for obesity com-
pared to overweight suggest that obesity prevalence, in
particular, is changing very quickly.

We also looked at the data for each of the 42 coun-
tries in our study ranked by GDP per capita (see Figure S2
in the supporting information online). There appears to
be little association between residence type and preva-
lence of overweight or obesity in countries with higher
GDP. Among lower-GDP countries, urban women are

more likely to be overweight or obese, and countries
around the middle and the bottom of the GDP distribu-
tion range have a higher proportion of urban women who
are overweight or obese compared to rural women. Sta-
tistical analyses show that increased per-capita GDP is
associated with increases in the absolute annual change in
prevalence of overweight and obesity only in rural areas.

KEY FACTORS EXPLAINING INCREASED OBESITY:
POTENTIAL ROLE IN FUTURE PROGRAMMATIC AND

POLICY MEASURES

Ultimately, obesity reﬂects energy imbalance, so the
major areas for intervention relate to dietary intake and
energy expenditure, for which the main modiﬁable com-
ponent is physical activity. It is clear that large shifts in
access to technology have reduced work-related energy
expenditure in the more labor-intensive occupations,
such as farming and mining, as well as in the less energy-
intensive sectors such as service and manufacturing.23
Changes in transportation,24 leisure, and home produc-
tion (cooking, cleaning, child care, etc.)25 have also led to
reduced physical activity. In addition, the complex inter-
play between biological factors operating during fetal and
infant development and the related energy imbalances
exacerbate many health problems.26 Such changes have
been well documented for China and are also found in
varying manifestations in many countries.

Finding ways to increase physical activity across all
age groups is important for public health, but options for
increasing energy expenditure through physical activity
may be limited in low- and middle-income countries. For
instance, to oﬀset any increase of about 110 kcal of food
or beverage in average daily energy intake, a woman
weighing 54 kg must walk moderately fast for 30 min and
a man weighing 82 kg for about 25 min. Such levels of
physical activity may be too much to expect, so dietary
modiﬁcation is a key approach to lowering obesity preva-
lence, particularly with the ongoing decline in physical
activity and increase in sedentary time (unpublished
data). The dietary dynamics represent a major set of
complex issues. On the global level, new access to tech-
nologies (e.g., cheap edible oils, foods with excessive
“empty calories,” modern supermarkets, and food distri-
bution and marketing) and regulatory environments
(e.g., the World Trade Organization and freer ﬂow of
goods, services, and technologies) are changing diets in
low- and middle-income countries. Accompanying this
are all the critical issues of food security and global access
to food suﬃcient to meet adequate levels of nutrient
intake. Many populations focus on basic grain and
legume food supplies, while the overall transition has
shifted the structure of prices and food availability and
created a nutrition transition linked with obesity as well

as hunger. We have used detailed data on time use along
with data on energy expenditures and other factors to
examine past patterns and trends in order to predict, until
2020 and 2030, patterns of physical activity and sedentary
behavior in the United States, the United Kingdom, Brazil,
China, and India.27

Prior to exploring the dietary dimension, we con-
sider an important biological factor aﬀecting obesity and
chronic diseases in rapidly developing countries in Asia
and Africa. This factor is the biological insults suﬀered
during fetal and infant development that may inﬂuence
susceptibility to the changes described above, thus inﬂu-
encing trends in the development and severity of chronic
disease in these countries.

Developmental origins of health and disease: Special
concerns for low- and middle-income countries

The patterns of change in dietary intake and energy
expenditure related to the global nutrition transition are
particularly important in the context of current theories
of the developmental origins of adult disease. Based on
three decades of research, it is now recognized that sus-
ceptibility to obesity and chronic diseases is inﬂuenced by
environmental exposures from the time of conception to
adulthood. An extensive body of literature demonstrates
that fetal nutritional insuﬃciency triggers a set of ana-
tomical, hormonal, and physiological changes
that
enhance survival in a “resource-poor” environment.28
However,
in a postnatal environment with plentiful
resources, these developmental adaptations may contrib-
ute to the development of disease. Some of the strongest
evidence on the long-term eﬀects of moderate to severe
nutrition restriction during pregnancy comes from
follow-up of infants born after maternal exposure to
famine conditions, such as those experienced in parts of
Europe during World War II. For example, AC Ravelli
et al.29 found higher rates of obesity in 50-year-old men
and women whose mothers were exposed to the Dutch
famine in the ﬁrst half of their pregnancies, and GP
Ravelli et al.30 found obesity among 19-year-old men
whose mothers experienced famine during their preg-
nancies. Similarly, a follow-up of Hmong refugee immi-
grants revealed higher rates of central obesity among
those raised in a war zone, with the eﬀects ampliﬁed
in those who migrated to the United States compared to
those living in a traditional rural setting.31

The developmental origins theory of mismatch ﬁts
closely with the broader issues of mismatch discussed
below, which emerged in our early research1,2 and later
work.32–34 The mismatch theory of early nutritional
deﬁcits followed by later excesses35 may be particularly
important in low- and middle-income countries under-
going rapid social and economic changes, because

6

Nutrition Reviews® Vol. 70(1):3–21

economic progress ampliﬁes mismatch. Much of the lit-
erature on the developmental origins of health and
disease focuses on chronic diseases. However, given the
strong association between chronic diseases and obesity,
particularly central obesity, this evidence is highly rel-
evant and provides a strong rationale for obesity preven-
tion eﬀorts
that have experienced
dramatic changes in the nutritional environment as a
consequence of nutrition transition.

in populations

Mechanisms may include eﬀects on the number of
nephrons in the kidney,36 glucocorticoid exposure subse-
quent to maternal stress, or poor nutritional status poten-
tially programming the insulin and hypothalamic-
pituitary axes for high levels of metabolic eﬃciency28 and
epigenetic changes. Maternal stress and speciﬁc aspects of
diet (for example, intake of folate and other methyl
donors)
can aﬀect DNA methylation and gene
expression.37–39 Ongoing studies in places such as India
are examining the role of maternal micronutrient intake
on epigenetic changes that aﬀect child adiposity.39,40
Research in India has provided other important insights.
For example, Indian infants with poorly nourished
mothers are born with weight deﬁcits, but in relative
terms the deﬁcits in lean mass are greater than those in
adiposity. In later life, when modern high-energy and
high-fat diets are consumed, the previously “thin-fat”
babies also have greater central adiposity.41,42

It is apparent from studies of the developmental
origins of disease that there is a strong intergenerational
component to health.While much of the literature on the
early origins of obesity and associated risk has focused on
undernutrition, there is also substantial evidence that
maternal overweight and obesity in pregnancy inﬂuence
disease risk among oﬀspring. For example, gestational
diabetes is related to oﬀspring body composition and
increased risk of insulin resistance and diabetes in oﬀ-
spring.43,44 Thus, there is concern about an intergenera-
tional ampliﬁcation of diabetes risk. Women who were
malnourished as children are at increased risk of being
centrally obese and having impaired glucose tolerance as
adults.If these conditions aﬀect a woman’s pregnancy,her
oﬀspring will be at increased risk of early development of
obesity and diabetes. As obesity develops at younger and
younger ages, the likelihood that adolescents and young
women who become pregnant will experience complica-
tions associated with gestational diabetes and hyperten-
sion will increase dramatically. There is growing evidence
that maternal obesity, even without gestational diabetes, is
a risk factor for child obesity through a pathway related to
fetal overnutrition (see the review by Fall45).

On the other end of the nutrition spectrum, short
maternal
stature acts as a physical constraint on
fetal growth,46,47 and stunting in oﬀspring may, in turn,
relate to increased obesity risk.48

Beyond the fetal period,nutrition and other contribu-
tors to health in infancy, childhood, and adolescence are
important determinants of adult body composition and
obesity risk. In light of the large increases in overweight
and obesity in children as well as adults, attempts have
been made to determine the ages at which faster weight
gain relates to later obesity. A large body of literature
relates “rapid growth” during infancy to risk of obesity in
later childhood and into adulthood.49 In addition, rapid
weight gain, particularly from mid-childhood onwards, is
related to increased risk of elevated blood pressure or
impaired fasting glucose in young adulthood in low- and
middle-income countries.50 Concerns have been raised
about the promotion of rapid weight gain in children who
are malnourished. In low-income countries catch-up or
compensatory growth following a period of faltering
growth is desirable, because it is associated with reduced
morbidity and improved survival51–53 as well as better cog-
nitive development.54 A key concern, however, is whether
the beneﬁts of faster growth in these settings outweigh the
possible long-term risks.Based on the COHORTS analysis
of children from ﬁve low- and middle-income countries,
faster weight gain in the ﬁrst 2 years of life has a number of
beneﬁts.It is associated with the development of lean body
mass but not with increased risk of impaired fasting
glucose or diabetes in young adulthood (data submitted
for publication: e.g., Kuzawa et al.55). In light of observa-
tions that patterns of child growth have important conse-
quences for the development of obesity and chronic
diseases, another line of research focuses on factors that
contribute to or protect against early development of adi-
posity. In this regard, the potential programming roles of
early diet have been explored,including the roles of breast-
feeding and high intakes of dietary protein, fat, and
sodium.These topics are important in light of the dramatic
changes in diet composition that characterize many popu-
lations in the developing world.

Of course, early feeding issues are important. Some
studies show a protective eﬀect of breastfeeding on later
development of obesity and chronic diseases,56,57 while
other studies show no eﬀects.58 Similarly, consistently
high protein intake during complementary feeding in the
ﬁrst 2 years of life has been associated with a higher mean
BMI and body fat percentage at 7 years of age in cohort
studies of German children,59 and other researchers have
suggested a strong link between high protein intake and
obesity.60

Dietary fat (both the amount and the composition)
may also play a role in the development of non-
communicable diseases. The STRIP study in Finland
demonstrated that lower total and saturated dietary fat
intake in infancy results in lower serum cholesterol,
LDL cholesterol, and triglyeride levels (as well as
lower blood pressure) in children up to 14 years of age,

Nutrition Reviews® Vol. 70(1):3–21

7

even without eﬀects on height, weight, or BMI.61,62
Worldwide, the increase in plant-oil consumption has
increased the intake of n-6 fatty acids and the ratio of
n-6 to n-3 fatty acids. This is a concern, because high
intake of n-6 fatty acids is associated with altered
immune function, diﬀerentiation of preadipocytes into
mature fat cells, and changes in fat deposition patterns.
Another study relates high sodium intake from infant
formula and weaning foods to increased blood pressure
in adulthood.63

Dietary changes

The knowledge emerging from developmental origins
research addresses only one dimension of
the shift
toward greater obesity. While early life exposures and
biological insults appear to enhance the adverse eﬀects of
dietary change, in the end, shifts in energy balance and the
entire structure of the diet have played major concomi-
tant and separate roles. Here, we will speak ﬁrst of broad
trends and then return to the issues of poverty and avail-
ability. These link the set of dynamic changes in our food
supply with food security.

It is useful to understand how vastly diets have
changed in low- and medium-income countries to con-
verge on what is often termed the “Western diet.” This is
broadly deﬁned by high intakes of reﬁned carbohydrates,
added sugars, fats, and animal-source foods. Data avail-
able for low- and middle-income countries document
this trend in all urban areas and, increasingly, in rural
areas. Diets rich in legumes, other vegetables, and coarse
grains are disappearing in all regions and countries, and
some major global developments in technology are asso-
ciated with this shift.

Edible oil and vegetable oil revolution. Fats have major
beneﬁts in terms of improving the ﬂavor of food. Some
scientists suggest that the selection of fat-rich, as opposed
to carbohydrate-rich, foods is primarily determined by
brain mechanisms that may include central levels of neu-
rotransmitters, hormones, or neuropeptides.1 In the
1950s and 1960s in the United States and Japan, technol-
ogy was developed to cheaply remove oils from oilseeds
(e.g., corn, soybean, cottonseed, and red palm seeds).1
Breeding techniques to increase the oil content of these
seeds accompanied the processing shifts, and higher-
income countries saw a large increase in the availability of
cheap vegetable oils. This was followed by the removal of
erucic acid from rapeseed oil to create healthier canola
oil, which was accompanied by extensive research on the
good and bad components of each edible oil (e.g., trans
fats and speciﬁc fatty acids). By 2010, inexpensive oils
were available throughout the developing world. Between
1985 and 2010,
intakes of vegetable oils

individual

increased between three- and sixfold in the developing
world, depending on the subpopulation studied. In
China, which has moderate, but not high, vegetable oil
intake, persons aged 2 years and older consumed, on
average, almost 300 calories and more than 30 grams of
vegetable oil daily in 2006.64

Caloric sweeteners. Diets around the world are much
sweeter today than heretofore.65 For example, 75% of
foods and beverages bought in the United States contain
added caloric sweeteners and the average American aged
2 years and older consumes about 375 kcal/day.66,67 In the
United States, one of the few countries in which the
amount of added sugar in the diet is estimated,68 research
has shown remarkable stability in the amount of added
sugar intake from food over the last 30 years, while the
amount of added sugar from beverages has increased
signiﬁcantly.66 In 1977–78, two-thirds of added sugar in
the US diet came from food; today, two-thirds comes
from beverages.66 However, this may be an underesti-
mate, since the added-sugar estimates from the US
Department of Agriculture exclude fruit juice concen-
trate, which is a source of sugar that has seen major
increases in consumption in the last decade and is now
found in over 10% of US foods (unpublished data).
Mexico, which experienced a doubling of caloric beverage
intake to more than 21% of the kilocalories/day for all age
groups from 1996 to 2002 is one of the few developing
countries with data on caloric beverage patterns and
trends.32,69,70 While individual dietary intake data are not
available for most low-income countries, national aggre-
gate data on sugar available for consumption (food dis-
appearance or food balance data) suggest this is a major
concern in all regions of the world.65

Shift toward increased animal-source food intake. Earlier
research by Delgado71 and others at the International
Food Policy Research Institute found the beginning of a
livestock revolution in the developing world. Subsequent
research has shown major increases in the production of
beef, pork, dairy products, eggs, and poultry across low-
and middle-income countries.72,73 Most of the global
increases in animal-source foods have been in low- and
middle-income countries. For example, India has experi-
enced a major increase in consumption of dairy products
and China in pork and eggs.

Increased consumption of animal-source food prod-
ucts has both positive and adverse health eﬀects. On the
one hand, for poor individuals throughout the developing
world, a few extra grams of animal-source foods can
signiﬁcantly improve the micronutrient proﬁle of the
diet. On the other hand, excessive consumption of
animal-source foods is linked with excessive saturated fat
intake and increased mortality.74,75

8

Nutrition Reviews® Vol. 70(1):3–21

Reduced intake of legumes, coarse grains, and other vegeta-
bles. While signiﬁcant systematic research on the reduced
consumption of these nutritionally important foods has
not been undertaken, it is clear from case studies that
consumption of beans, a vast array of bean products, and
what are often termed “coarse” grains, such as sorghum
and millet, has declined signiﬁcantly.6,76,77 This occurred
from the 1960s through the 1980s in the United States and,
more recently, across Asia and the rest of the Americas.78
Understanding the reasons underlying the trend
toward increased consumption of animal-source food,
oils, and caloric sweeteners and the reduced consumption
of legumes, coarse grains, and other vegetables begins
with understanding the relative shifts in price structure
that have occurred since World War II. Most of these
changes are purposeful and relate to agricultural policies
around the world.6,79

Food system changes

In the past 10–15 years, several factors have inﬂuenced
the food supplies of individual countries. The food system
characterizing most urban, and an increasing proportion
of rural, areas across low- and middle-income countries
has changed drastically with 1) the globalized distribution
of technology related to food production, transportation,
and marketing, 2) mass media, and 3) the ﬂow of capital
and services. Access to many new foods and beverages
with empty calories relates to current economic and
social development. Modern food technology has pro-
vided enormous and myriad beneﬁts including reducing
food waste, enhancing sanitation, and reducing many
adverse eﬀects of seasonality. The same is true for the
modern supermarket. While the critical beneﬁts of these
important changes to producers and consumers are
acknowledged, highlighted here are some of the potential
adverse eﬀects.

A key component of food system changes is modern
food distribution and sales. This is reﬂected in the enor-
mous penetration of super- and megamarket companies
throughout the developing world.80 Most countries also
have large convenience store chains. The fresh market
(wet or open public market) is disappearing as the major
source of food in the developing world and is being
replaced by large regional and local supermarkets, which
are usually part of multinational chains (e.g., Carrefour or
Walmart) or, in countries such as South Africa and China,
by domestic chains that function and look like the global
chains. Increasingly, hypermarkets (megastores) are the
major force driving changes in food expenditures in any
country or region. In Latin America, for example, super-
markets’ share of all retail food sales increased from 15%
in 1990 to 60% by 2000. In comparison, supermarkets in
the United States accounted for 80% of retail food sales

in 2000. This process is also occurring at varying rates in
Asia, Eastern Europe, the Middle East, and all urban areas
of Africa. We will undertake a national survey of diet and
related factors in India in 2012.

the modern food environment has

One report of a study performed in Guatemala sug-
gests that shifts in the food environment might enhance
intake of processed, lower-quality foods.81 Carlos Mon-
teiro has been particularly clear in expressing his concern
that
impacted
diets.4,5,82 Indeed, his concern regarding food processing
meshes well with the vast shift away from consumption of
legumes and coarse grains to consumption of reﬁned
grains purchased at modern supermarkets and conve-
nience stores, which have penetrated urban Africa and
Asia and most of the Middle East and Latin America.

The potential adverse eﬀects of these trends are asso-
ciated with increased access in developing countries to
cheaper, processed foods that are high in fat, added sugar,
and salt. At the same time, the trends provide some ben-
eﬁts. For example, supermarkets were instrumental in the
development of ultra-heat treatment for the pasteuriza-
tion of milk, giving it a long shelf life (not requiring
refrigeration) and providing a safe source of milk for all
income groups. Supermarkets were also key players in
establishing food safety standards.83 Most importantly,
they solved the cold chain problem and,in many instances,
brought higher-quality produce to the urban consumer
throughout the year. Other factors include the liberaliza-
tion of direct foreign investment, trade liberalization, and
the saturation of Western markets that has pushed
growing companies into other locales. Improvements in
the logistics and procurement systems used by supermar-
kets have allowed them to compete,on cost,with the more
typical outlets in developing countries – the small mom-
and-pop stores and wet markets (fresh or open public
markets) for fruits, vegetables, and all other products.

Another result of the global changes in food con-
sumption is the freer ﬂow of food trade linked with the
World Trade Organization. For instance, barriers to
imports of edible oil have been reduced, and vegetable oil
production has been centralized to compete with imports
and to signiﬁcantly lower the prices of vegetable oil in
countries such as China.

These changes, along with global investments in agri-
culture over the last half century, have produced a large
shift in relative prices to favor animal-source foods, edible
oils, and other key global commodities, including sugar.79
In the supporting information for this article available
online, Figure S3, reproduced from research at the Inter-
national Food Policy Research Institute, highlights some
of the global trends that have resulted from the vast
investment in the animal foods sector and feed crops
across the globe.71,79 Also in the supporting information,
Figure S4 highlights the real shifts in China in terms of

the relative costs of selected foods, based on data from
330 communities and their food markets.84

Food security and the dual burden of undernutrition
and obesity

This rapid transition in income and diet and the large
shift toward animal-source food consumption creates
major demands for basic grains to feed livestock, disre-
garding the needs of the poor for the same food supply.
While drought, climate change, and increased demand for
ethanol have contributed to global
food prices, the
longer-term structural shift relates to demand for animal-
source food and its impact on corn, rice, and wheat prices.
Alongside the real need for basic foods for the poor, the
marketing, desirability, and availability of such items as
low-cost edible oils and empty-calorie foods have encour-
aged the urban poor to consume lower-quality foods that
are obesogenic; these are widely believed to most likely be
the more heavily processed foods, but this has not yet
been documented. These complex changes are reﬂected
in the emergence of obesity alongside hunger, even in the
same households.

Families faced with an inability to grow food or inad-
equate income to purchase food will likely opt for the
cheapest cost per calorie from the available choices.When
food prices for basic grains double or triple, the pressures
to adjust food purchases increase.Among the most salient
issues are the vulnerability of poor, female-headed house-
holds85 and the combination of price increases and vola-
tility in global food markets (linked also with climate
change issues). It is also important to note that the relative
price changes matter most. If the prices of fatty foods, oils,
sugar, and animal-source foods go down relative to
legumes, fruits, and other vegetables, the latter items
become less attractive.

Despite substantial economic growth, large inequali-
ties remain in many low- and middle-income countries,
and it is common to see problems of underweight, stunt-
ing, and micronutrient deﬁciencies side by side with
increasing rates of obesity. This dual burden of undernu-
trition and obesity exists not only within countries and
communities,86 but also within households87,88 and even
in some individuals, who may have excess adiposity along
with micronutrient deﬁciencies, such as iron deﬁciency
anemia,87–90 or stunting and overweight. Dual-burden
households are most common in countries undergoing
nutrition transition,87,88 and the circumstance may be a
reﬂection of diﬀerences in food allocation related to
social norms based on gender or generation. For example,
high-quality foods may be given preferentially to adult
males rather than to children. But other patterns may
exist as well. In China, for example, it is common for
parents to indulge their children in the wake of the coun-

try’s one-child strategy for population control.91,92 Indi-
viduals of diﬀerent generations may also respond
diﬀerently to social and economic changes, with the
younger generation adopting new dietary patterns more
quickly, while the elderly continue to eat in more tradi-
tional (and sometimes healthier) ways.

A challenge for food programs and policies is the
need to address food insecurity and hunger without
adding to the burden of overweight and obesity. This is
particularly challenging given the relatively low cost and
high availability of foods that are energy-dense but low in
micronutrient content. Again, it is relative prices that
matter. The lack of focus on coarse grains, legumes, and
other vegetables and the vast attention to sugar crops,
oilseeds, vegetable oil technologies, and cheaper animal-
source foods have contributed to the global shift in diets.
In countries such as Mexico, Brazil, Chile, and China,
where great strides have been made to minimize acute
malnutrition through programs targeting vulnerable sub-
populations, hunger and malnutrition have been reduced.
One example is Oportunidades, the conditional cash
transfer program in Mexico that provides a stipend and
complementary food for preschoolers.93,94 It is recognized
that such programs must be tailored to address malnutri-
tion while not accelerating energy imbalance and obesity
among the recipients, as has occurred in some pro-
grams.93,95 For instance, Chile continued to feed young
children in its various feeding programs even when most
were adequately nourished; the programs were not revised
to deal with energy imbalance issues for some time after
undernutrition was successfully reduced.95 To address
child obesity in Mexico, the Mexican government found it
necessary to reduce the fat content of the milk distributed
in its feeding programs, along with other changes.

CURRENT EXPERIENCES AND MAJOR INITIATIVES

One of the major gaps in the area of large-scale, health-
related interventions that needs to be ﬁlled is rigorous
evaluation of existing programs and initiatives followed
by reﬁnements to enhance their eﬃcacy. In fact, with one
exception, across the globe there have been no rigorous
evaluations or reviews of interventions in terms of their
impact on diet or obesity. The one exception is Mexico,
where the eﬀects of welfare and feeding programs on
obesity were evaluated.93,95 The evaluation was designed
as part of a large quasi-experimental study of welfare in
Mexico and was not designed to examine the food com-
ponent. Thus, it is impossible to highlight in any unbiased
manner what might and might not work. In essence, no
funding has existed for evaluation activities across the
low- and middle-income world.

The lack of appropriate technology and environ-
ments to foster beneﬁcial change is a critical health issue.

10

Nutrition Reviews® Vol. 70(1):3–21

In many ways, it would be ideal to refocus attention on
these points and away from what is often perceived as
irrational behavior and ignorance governing individual
and household consumption patterns. Across the globe,
the major focus is on education. This focus is identical to
the way agriculture systems assisted farmers across the
globe. Ignoring environmental determinants, outsiders
assumed the poor were ignorant, lazy, illiterate peasants
who would never change without technology, and the
programs suﬀered from problems associated with the
approach. With an understanding of appropriate versus
inappropriate technologies and the rationale behind the
decisions made by farmers and others, the development
approach to agriculture changed completely96 and an
appreciation of the interplay of literacy and education
with technology and extension developed.97 However, in
the health sector and in public health education there
remains a perception that set goals will be met by provid-
ing the buildings and the technologies.

Institutional and large-scale feeding programs

As described earlier in this article, most of the large-scale
initiatives to systematically address obesity, such as those
in Brazil, Mexico, and Chile, have focused on schools.98
Brazil, for example, requires that a signiﬁcant portion of
expenditures come from local food. Some large-scale
feeding systems have focused on low-income areas such as
those providing low-cost food via community kitchens in
Peru.99 Surprisingly, few examples of large-scale feeding
have focused on providing a healthful diet that addresses
concerns of obesity that exist in low- and middle-income
countries.

Education: Labeling and front-of-package initiatives

Front-of-package labeling provides information that
helps consumers make healthier food choices and stimu-
lates product reformulation. This began globally with a
desire to reduce saturated and trans fats, added salt, and
added sugar in so-called empty-calorie foods and to
enhance fruit, vegetable, and whole-grain intake while
limiting energy intake. The most common approach is
that promoted by an international program led by scien-
tists at
the Choices International Foundation. This
product-speciﬁc nutrient-proﬁling approach has devel-
oped food categories, revised them to meet unique
country- and region-speciﬁc dietary needs, and created
food group-speciﬁc nutrition criteria to show what items
represent a healthy choice.100 Recently, the US Institute of
Medicine recommended a single front-of-package design
somewhat similar to the Choices’ approach, but the delib-
erations are still in process.101,102

Underlying this system is the need to reformulate a
vast array of products to enhance their healthfulness. For
instance, there are at least 200,000 packaged foods and
beverages in the United States with unique formulations.67
Reducing their energy content and enhancing their quality
is linked with this front-of-package labeling eﬀort.

Regulations regarding beverages and food marketing

The World Health Organization (WHO) and other orga-
nizations have called for regulations to minimize or
eliminate the marketing of less healthy foods and to con-
sider ways to control consumption of sugary beverages.
Brazil and Chile have initiated controls over the mar-
keting of unhealthful foods with an oﬃcial national code
of marketing. A second initiative relates to the control of
sugar-sweetened beverages. A large number of global
health groups (such as those concerned with diabetes,
heart disease, and cancer) have called for reductions in
sugar-sweetened beverage intake. In some cases, this has
included 100% fruit juice, and in all cases it has included
carbonated sugar-sweetened beverages,
fruit drinks,
energy drinks, sports drinks, and vitamin waters. More
than 20 countries have prohibited vending machines in
schools and prohibited sales of these less healthful foods
by outside vendors on school grounds.

Mexico is one of the few low- or middle-income
countries to aggressively move against sugar-sweetened
beverages and other high-calorie, less healthful bever-
ages (e.g., full-fat whole milk versus 1% reduced-fat
milk). In Mexico, the Ministry of Health created a set of
beverage guidelines that the government used to change
procedures in their feeding and welfare programs and in
schools.32 An as yet unaddressed area is foods high in
saturated fats and added sugars. Called “junk foods” or
foods with excessive amounts of “empty calories,” these
represent an increasing portion of diets across the
globe.4,5,82,103 There is very limited research to show what
increasing the costs of such foods might do to diets
overall.104 Would people just substitute other reﬁned
carbohydrates or fried foods? Would calories be cut?
Could this lead to healthier food choices? There is a
great need for well-monitored and -evaluated small- and
large-scale studies of such activities prior to promoting
them, and there is a need for research using extant data
to understand how price shifts might aﬀect the structure
of diets.

Schools

As noted above, countries throughout the world have
focused on school feeding and vending policies. Examples
as simple as providing potable water along with water
education show that even small eﬀorts with an initial

Nutrition Reviews® Vol. 70(1):3–21

11

investment and small marginal costs can have an
impact.105

Country-speciﬁc initiatives

While there are unique issues in many countries, Mexico
is focused on here due to space constraints. Mexico expe-
rienced one of the world’s largest increases in obesity,
diabetes, and cardiometabolic diseases in the 1990–2010
period.106–108 It is one of the very few countries aggres-
sively pursuing a full-scale eﬀort to slow down and
reverse the obesity trend. First, the government addressed
calories consumed from beverages, including excessive
calories from whole milk, sugar-sweetened beverages,
and heavily sweetened agua frescas (fruit juice, water, and
added sugar).32 Among the major actions recommended
by the government’s Beverage Guidance Panel was the
removal of all whole milk from government programs
and replacement with 1.5% milk. This was followed in
2010 by development of an Obesity Prevention Strategy
signed by all ministers and the president. More recently,
an agreement between the major Mexican food compa-
nies and the Ministries of Health and Education removed
most foods and beverages with high sugar and high satu-
rated fat content from schools. The government also
established a front-of-package initiative to provide Min-
istry of Health-approved healthy food labels for foods
with reduced sodium, sugar, and saturated fats along with
more healthful components.

In comparison, Asian countries have generally done
little, but Singapore and Thailand are exceptions. In Thai-
land, eﬀorts have been led by key nutritionists and Prin-
cess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn. The government has
started a number of infant feeding and school initiatives
related to obesity prevention. They have revised food
labeling, increased promotion of fruits and vegetables,
and worked on reducing the fat and oil content of foods,
but they have not yet invested signiﬁcant resources or
developed a comprehensive program.

In Latin America, Brazil and Chile are initiating a
number of measures; however, the eﬀorts have and will
continue to come up against food industry concerns, as
highly processed and unhealthful foods are found in
schools and elsewhere.109

FUTURE OPTIONS AT THE COMMUNITY AND

LARGE-SCALE LEVELS

If we are to prevent obesity and reduce the rapid increases
in global obesity, the prime focus must be on the food
supply and improving the quality of diets while reducing
total caloric intake. From the intervention, program-
matic, and policy perspectives, this is the area with most
potential. Will interventions in pregnancy and infancy

represent the key to preventing future overweight? Can
such interventions work without major shifts in energy
imbalance and thus in diets in later life?

A second and equally important set of questions
relates to improving diets at all ages. Can we recover all
the healthful elements of diets lost over the last half
century (e.g., beans or legumes from many countries,
coarse grains and whole-grain products from others, veg-
etables from many)? How do we reduce the excessive
consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages, fatty, salty
and sugary reﬁned carbohydrate foods termed ultra-
processed foods by Monteiro, junk foods by some, and
empty-calorie foods by others.4,5,68,110,111 Are measurement
methods in the current food systems adequate to address
our concerns about diet quality and quantity67? While
changes in food systems are linked with dietary shifts, the
changes in the overall global food systems are so pro-
found for low- and middle-income countries that they are
discussed brieﬂy as a third concern. A fourth area relates
to the health sector and its role in addressing these food
and nutrition issues. Is its role to advocate and work for
regulations or to work with others to educate the public?
Fifth, we ﬁnd food insecurity, major constraints on the
poor, and many of the issues of poverty and low educa-
tion aﬀecting obesity just as they aﬀect diﬀerentially the
problems of hunger and malnutrition. What can the food
insecurity literature suggest about addressing obesity in
the developing world?

Direct feeding, care, and prevention interventions at
the community level

What options emerge from the developmental origins
theory? Consideration of the developmental origins of
obesity and chronic diseases is important because 1) there
is strong evidence to support a role for early-life expo-
sures in the development of later disease risk, 2) there is
potential for intergenerational ampliﬁcation of risk, and
3) prevention eﬀorts can capitalize on the same develop-
mental plasticity that alters susceptibility to disease to
intervene early to prevent obesity. As stated by Peter
Gluckman, the “greatest leverage in terms of reduction of
risk can be achieved through a timely intervention in the
developmentally plastic phase.”35

The ﬁrst 1,000 days. Current focus for child survival and
healthy growth and development in resource-poor set-
tings is on the ﬁrst 1,000 days.112 This begins with preg-
nancy, with attention needed to ensure high dietary
quality, including micronutrient adequacy, and to opti-
mize pregnancy weight gain, avoiding inadequate as well
as excessive gains.113 However, since early pregnancy
matters, it is vital that interventions optimize the health
and nutritional status of young women prior to preg-

12

Nutrition Reviews® Vol. 70(1):3–21

nancy. This implies a need to focus on the period from
childhood to adolescence as well in order to promote
linear growth, minimize excess gains in adiposity, and
establish healthy patterns of diet and physical activity.
Recent attention has focused on young girls as an impor-
tant target for improving health (e.g., Center for Global
Development, Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Start
with a Girl: A New Agenda for Global Health [http://
www.cgdev.org/content/publications/detail/1422899/],
and Girls Count:A Global Investment and Action Agenda
[http://www.cgdev.org/content/publications/detail/
15154]). This focus is also important in light of the fact
that in several low- and middle-income countries, such as
South Africa and Guatemala, obesity increases sharply in
girls in the years following menarche,114 putting young
women at risk for pregnancies complicated by obesity as
well as micronutrient deﬁciencies.

Some adverse eﬀects related to feeding deserve
careful consideration in program and policy work.
Limited evidence from randomized clinical trials in high-
income settings shows that a higher protein content in
infant formula is associated with higher weight in the ﬁrst
2 years of life but has no eﬀect on linear growth115 and
that feeding a nutrient-enriched formula to infants who
are small for their gestational age is related to higher fat
mass in mid-childhood.116 In Finland, a randomized
study of individualized dietary and lifestyle counseling to
reduce intake of saturated fat decreased the prevalence of
overweight in school-age girls.117 These studies demon-
strate the potential for dietary modiﬁcation to inﬂuence
obesity risk. Experimental evidence from low- and
middle-income settings on dietary interventions to
reduce obesity in infancy and childhood is lacking. Most
nutrition intervention trials have been geared toward the
amelioration of stunting and enhancement of growth of
malnourished children.

Research is needed to deﬁne an optimal weaning and
early childhood diet that promotes linear growth and lean
body mass while minimizing excess adiposity. An exten-
sive body of literature has explored whether breastfeeding
reduces the risk of child obesity and it generally ﬁnds only
small or minimal protective eﬀects. However, breastfeed-
ing is well known to contribute to healthy growth and to
reduce stunting, which is, in turn, associated with later
overweight in low-income populations.118 Thus, the pro-
motion of breastfeeding has value in the context of
obesity prevention in low- and middle-income countries.
the potential
importance of intervening in pregnancy and infancy to
prevent later obesity,119 there is a lack of speciﬁcity about
the components of potentially successful interventions.
This reﬂects a lack of knowledge relevant to early obesity
prevention in low- and middle-income countries. More-
over, investigators are just now beginning to assess the

While there is an appreciation of

relative importance and potential
impact of prenatal
versus postnatal eﬀects and the relative importance of
diﬀerent periods
(infancy, childhood, adolescence).
Owing to the relatively recent acceptance of the premises
put forth to support the developmental origins of adult
disease risk and the need for long-term cohort studies to
test interventions, there is, as yet, no empirical evidence to
support such eﬀorts as a means to inﬂuence obesity and
chronic disease risk. However, several trials have been
initiated, but have yet to be published. For example, in
Pune, India, Yajnik and colleagues have begun to provide
nutritional supplements to adolescent girls prior to and
during pregnancy.

Clearly, there is a large and presently unmet need to
explore the implications of interventions based on devel-
opmental origins concepts, but it is essential to include a
life-course perspective that recognizes intergenerational
risks and the importance of infant and young child nutri-
tion. Given the persistent problems of poor nutrition
(stunting, impaired intellectual development, increased
morbidity) that coexist with the development of child
obesity, it is critical that interventions be geared to opti-
mize nutritional status through careful attention to diet
quality and composition with the aim of enhancing linear
growth, eliminating micronutrient deﬁciencies, and pre-
venting obesity.

Focus on the food supply

The question that arises repeatedly is, why can’t we just
return to earlier, healthier components of traditional
diets in Asia, Africa, and other transitional regions of the
world? Here, a set of options is grouped in a manner
consistent with that used by the International Obesity
Task Force.

Food-related ﬁscal measures. Are there ways to shift diets
towards (or back to) healthier components? Can we alter
relative prices? Can we learn ways to promote legumes
and other vegetables that link naturally with food system
development? A major area of concern across the globe is
the loss of overall healthy dietary patterns and the
removal of key components of the diet. The thinking is
that since dietary patterns shifted greatly in a span of 10
to 20 years, they can shift again just as readily.

The ﬁrst problem relates to the relative prices of
foods consumed as basic staples prior to the major dietary
changes of the past 20–50 years. These include whole
grains, legumes, other vegetables, and fruits that many
scholars felt were part of the healthier components of
diets across the globe before the 1960s. Relative prices
globally have reduced the cost of animal-source foods,
oils, sugar, and related products.79 Removal of subsidies in
the United States and Europe might not appreciably alter

Nutrition Reviews® Vol. 70(1):3–21

13

the relatively lower prices of animal-source foods, oils,
and sweeteners, among others.120,121 In contrast, there is
no research on the role subsidies play in the shift in the
overall structure of diets in low- and middle-income
countries. Such work is needed to fully understand if
government interventions, which are numerous in most
Asian, African, and Latin American countries, adversely
aﬀect the quality of the diet and are linked with excessive
caloric intake. In 1989, a conference was held in China
that discussed the future problems with obesity, the large
subsidies of fatty pork, and the reduced intake of legumes,
especially soy and soy products, in China. The Chinese
Ministry of Agriculture subsequently made a small eﬀort
to reduce the pork subsidy. (It should be noted that the
conference was a joint endeavor of the Chinese Academy
of Medical Sciences and Chinese Academy of Agricul-
tural Sciences, and the Ministries of Health, Rural Devel-
opment, and Agriculture were also involved).78,120,121 It is
presently unclear if it is possible to adjust relative pricing
and preferences in favor of more healthful foods, but this
represents one key global long-term goal.

One of the major targets of eﬀorts to rapidly improve
public health has been the taxation of select foods and
beverages, particularly sugar-sweetened beverages. Many
countries have initiated discussions about implementing,
or have attempted to add, sugar-sweetened beverage taxa-
tion, and some global organizations, such as the World
Cancer Research Fund and the World Heart Federation,
have made this a central cause in their work. Mexico
provides a prime example of how a government initiative
has been implemented to control sugar-sweetened bever-
age consumption in schools and thereby reduce the
number of calories consumed from beverages.32,69,70
Worldwide, over 20 countries have banned all sugary bev-
erages from schools, and about 12 have banned 100%
fruit juice as well. Limited literature supports the poten-
tial beneﬁts of taxation of sugary beverages.7,12,122–125

Monteiro has raised the controversial question of
whether it is possible to remove some of the heavy reliance
on ultraprocessed food.He deﬁnes ultraprocessed foods as
basically confections of processed foods,typically with the
sophisticated use of additives to make them edible, palat-
able,and habit-forming.He feels this leaves the food prod-
ucts with no real resemblance to regular food (e.g.,
commodities such as produce or meat), even though they
may be shaped, labeled, and marketed to seem wholesome
and fresh.4,5,82 Monteiro claims that ultraprocessed foods
are a problem because they readily induce overeating and
are a major source of empty calories. In many ways, this
argument echoes the desire of Michael Pollan and other
authors around the globe who want to see a return to the
consumption of basic commodities like fruits, vegetables,
poultry, and other meat but no ultraprocessed foods (or
very limited use of such foods).126

Given the dominance of a large and complex chain of
food handling from farm to consumer, with varying
degrees of processing aﬀecting all foods, it is hard to know
what to label as an ultraprocessed food. Further, the prac-
ticality of these initiatives from both a global hunger and
an environmental perspective has yet to be examined. In
the case of ultraprocessed food, the question of whether
or not we can we actually provide healthier food for large
populations across the globe remains. For elites, income,
time, and price constraints may not be as restrictive as for
other socioeconomic groups, and there are indications
that shifts towards more natural foods may be occurring
in this group. Evidence of this includes the rebirth of
farmers markets (wet markets) across the United States
and other high-income countries, growth of the Slow
Food movement, and even the growing availability of
organic food in the global food supply. However, global-
ization of the food supply, technological advances in pro-
cessing and preservation, and the ultraprocessing of food
may be so far along that it is impossible to return to
simpler, more traditional ways of obtaining food and pre-
paring it.

Private sector voluntary initiatives. Is it possible to work
with global and national food companies to enhance the
quality and reduce the caloric content of processed foods?
Will voluntary initiatives work? Will food companies
promote regulatory and other policy changes that address
global obesity? And, can we succeed in improving diets if
global companies (many of which are bigger than some
nations in income and assets) do not cooperate? These are
complex questions that are almost impossible to answer,
and history has shown that cooperation is only possible in
some cases. Many use the example of the battle against
smoking behavior and tobacco use as the approach to be
used in addressing the “bad” elements of the food sup-
ply.127,128 However, the scope and reach of the food com-
panies is far greater than that of the tobacco companies,
and the need for all consumers to eat food leads to
complex issues when focus is sharpened on what many
feel is an essential point – there are “good” foods to
encourage and “bad” foods to discourage and it is no
longer possible to rely on consumers to eat a “healthful”
diet voluntarily.
Currently,

initiatives are
underway. The one that seems most promising is the
potential reduction of total calories proposed by 17
leading food companies. Their commitment
in the
United States is to remove 1.5 trillion calories from the
total US supply of the processed foods they sell by 2015.
They have made no explicit agreements with other
countries on the exact amount of calorie reduction;
however, they are negotiating a similar arrangement in
Australia. The US arrangement is under the umbrella of

several major global

14

Nutrition Reviews® Vol. 70(1):3–21

the Healthy Weight Commitment Foundation (http://
www.healthyweightcommit.org/). The University of
North Carolina (UNC) Food Research Program team is
the oﬃcial outside evaluator of the eﬀort. Even in the
United States, these global giants control only about
25–30% of the total calories consumed. Therefore, there
are questions not only about the true eﬀectiveness of the
changes in the companies’ own sales models and prod-
ucts but also about consumer substitutions of other
packaged and processed food and beverage products
and other sources of calories.

Walmart is leading a second initiative in the United
States in which it has pledged to cut the amount of calories
sold, albeit without specifying a solid exact amount or a
strong external evaluation plan. Furthermore, it is unclear
how Walmart will translate this pledge to its global stores.
There is no clear evidence that these voluntary
pledges will be linked with reduced energy intake,
improve diet quality, or reduce obesity, even for the global
companies.129,130 To date, studies on topics such as control
of mass media marketing to children provide little evi-
dence of any noticeable decline in marketing of empty
calorie foods.131 Furthermore, these voluntary eﬀorts
seem to be focused on the United States, Europe, or other
high-income countries and not the low- and middle-
income world.

There is a key additional element. Global food com-
panies are responsible for the major portion of sales of
certain categories of foods, such as sugar-sweetened bev-
erages, in low- and middle-income countries. However,
there are numerous local food preparers, processors, and
distributors. Even if global food companies reduce the
caloric content of their products, it is unclear whether
those products would simply be replaced by those of local
competitors with higher caloric content. Our group is
attempting to determine if we can even measure the reach
of global food companies in countries as diverse as the
United States and China. In higher-income countries,
where governance is open, it is relatively simple to do;
however, across the globe, the roles of global companies
become much murkier and are often impossible to gauge
accurately as information on ownership is not publicly
obtainable. Further, there is the indirect impact of these
companies on how foods are produced, processed, and
distributed and even the types of products that compa-
nies want to market as food and drink.132 A publication by
JL Watson showed how the introduction of McDonald’s
into Hong Kong, China, Taiwan, Japan, and other Asian
countries aﬀected the entire culture of food service and
preparation in other restaurants.132

The United States and Western Europe have imple-
mented food safety and labeling controls and careful
monitoring of many components of marketed food, but
what will happen as global food and agribusiness compa-

nies become active in low- and middle-income transi-
tional economies? As with tobacco, will “junk food” and
unethical marketing be focused on low- and middle-
income countries? Our team at the University of North
Carolina has found some evidence of this in the sugar-
sweetened beverage arena.3 We conducted a case study of
the two largest and most inﬂuential producers of sweet-
ened beverages, the Coca-Cola Company and PepsiCo,
who, together, control 34% of the global soft drink market
and 69% of the carbonated soft drink market. We exam-
ined how they adjusted their product portfolios globally
and in three critical markets (the United States, Brazil,
and China) in 2000–2010. On a global basis, total rev-
enues and calories sold per capita increased. In the United
States, both total calories per capita and calories per
ounce sold decreased, while the opposite was true in the
developing markets of Brazil and China. Total calories per
capita increased greatly in China and, to a lesser extent, in
Brazil.3 It is quite possible that such shifts will cross into
many other categories of food. It is clear that the declines
in kcal/ounce in the United States reﬂects a shift toward
greater marketing of low-calorie options. It might also
reﬂect the increased demand for low-calorie beverages,
but it is impossible to untangle supply and demand. In
Brazil, despite the increased attention to obesity and large
declines in obesity among women, there is no evidence of
a shift in consumption patterns (unpublished data).

Healthy public policies

Where does the public health system ﬁt into this? In many
countries, the modern medical sector represents a major
contact point for individuals during critical times in the
life cycle (pregnancy, infancy, and aging). Also, modern
medical practitioners are held in high esteem. The public
health sector thus has a particularly important role to play
through its contact with individuals and families in many
countries. At the same time, when it comes to guidance
related to obesity,
the
provincial/state or national levels in which this sector has
been mobilized and used eﬀectively to prevent obesity.
Rarely is there evidence that nurses, physicians, and other
medical professionals raise and discuss intelligently the
issues of proper diet and physical activity patterns.

there are few examples at

Negative eﬀects of current programs focused traditionally
on undernutrition. As the experiences in Mexico and
Brazil show, traditional poverty alleviation and food pro-
grams can have unforeseen consequences, especially in
environments in which activity patterns have become
more sedentary. Are there current food and nutrition
programs that actually increase the risk of obesity in Asia,
the Middle East, and Africa? What about other macroeco-
nomic policies? This, again, is an under-researched area.

Nutrition Reviews® Vol. 70(1):3–21

15

As noted in reports of studies performed in Chile
and Mexico, there is the potential that current feeding
programs can be focused on reducing hunger and mal-
nutrition, but instead of requiring additional calories,
their target populations may need higher-quality foods.
The outcome may otherwise be increased weight gain and
obesity.93,95,133 Little is known about this issue globally,
since the focus has been primarily on the prevention or
treatment of undernutrition, and data have not been sys-
tematically evaluated for potential eﬀects on excess
weight gain and obesity. As countries make the transition
from reduced hunger and poverty toward less con-
strained food supplies, increased incomes, and modern
infrastructure, there is a concomitant reduction in physi-
cal activity and in the quality of foods consumed – factors
that are clear contributors to overweight and obesity.

Can schools promote change? Globally, there has been a
large shift toward consumption of precooked and prepre-
pared, highly processed, empty-calorie food. In many
countries, knowledge about food and skills in food prepa-
ration and cooking are being lost as new generations
grow increasingly reliant on food prepared in locations
outside the home.6,134 To combat this problem, the United
Kingdom built kitchens to teach cooking to boys and girls
in middle schools throughout the entire country over the
2000–2010 period.135–138 Can school gardens and teaching
exercises that enhance understanding of food and food
preparation encourage the next generation to cook and
consume healthier food? Little is known about this
option.

A few studies suggest that such options might work,
but rigorous evaluations do not yet exist. Nevertheless, in
South Korea, a generation of young housewives was
trained to cook traditional low-fat and healthy vegetable
dishes. This was linked to high vegetable intake and low
fat intake.139,140 Similarly, there is some evidence that
training several generations of women in France to cook
with portion controls might have been important for
reduced portion sizes in France.6,141,142

Trade. Globalization and the World Trade Organization
are often credited with opening the globe to free trade in
food and services.143 There are eﬀects such as reduced
edible-oil prices and increased intake of these oils in
China that can be linked to speciﬁc agreements, such as
those addressing trade barriers to imports. However,
modernization and increased trade go hand in hand with
improvements in the quality of living that no country
would willingly forego. The gap lies in our knowledge of
speciﬁc components of trade agreements that might
adversely aﬀect diet and the eﬀects of trade and economic
policies on dietary patterns.

Marketing of unhealthy food to children. A prime area of
concern is how food marketing to children contributes to
an obesogenic environment. The role of media – televi-
sions, computers, notebooks, or cell phones – has
expanded in use and impact. The media have ready access
to the consumer, and the global penetration is such that
not a household, village, or urban sector is missed. At the
same time, product placement in movies, on billboards,
and elsewhere has created an environment in which chil-
dren and adults are assaulted with visions of eating and
drinking that are creating global shifts in food demand.
Thus, a prime target for combating obesity is media
control, though all initiatives to date have focused only on
marketing to children and not on the total marketing
environment, as occurred with early eﬀorts to control
tobacco advertising.127,128,144,145 Control of advertising rep-
resents a major aspect of tobacco control in countries that
have seriously reduced tobacco use. There may, thus, be
important lessons from the tobacco story that are relevant
for food.

Public sector healthy food service policies. The public
sector feeds enormous numbers of individuals in schools,
hospitals, and government departments. Improving the
quality of
food served in these institutions remains
another key measure.98 As with the marketing of foods,
only minimal evaluations of initiatives in this sector as
they relate to diet and body composition have been
completed.

Food and nutrition labeling. Food labeling is emerging
as a major global initiative. In Latin America, Asia, and
Africa the focus is not only on providing “nutrition
facts” panels on foods but also on developing systems
for identifying which foods and beverages are deemed
healthy according to the food customs of each country
and global initiatives to reduce added sugar, trans fats,
other saturated fats, and added sodium while encourag-
ing consumption of whole grains, fruits, legumes, and
other vegetables.100 India, China, Brazil, Mexico, South
Africa, and Chile are all considering such initiatives.
This is a very promising option as the global food
supply increases in complexity, and consumers across
the globe increasingly shift consumption to processed
and packaged foods and to shopping in commercial
chains, be they convenience stores, grocery stores, super-
markets, or megamarts.

CONCLUSION

In the past half century, there have been vast shifts in how
humans eat and drink, the incidence of energy imbalance,
overweight, and obesity, and the vast array of other

16

Nutrition Reviews® Vol. 70(1):3–21

nutrition-related cardiometabolic problems. Unfortu-
nately, we do not have the data to document precisely
how these changes compare with others over the course
of human evolution. However, from our perspective, as
individuals concerned with attaining a healthy diet and
healthier body composition, it appears as if many adverse
changes have accelerated in the past several decades
across the globe. This does not mean that all of the
changes that have occurred are perceived as harmful. In
contrast, the improvements to food convenience and
safety, the increasingly fatty, sweet, and salty diets, and the
new and interesting beverages with great ﬂavors bring
many beneﬁts. However, it is critical to evolve toward a
healthier diet, and in many cases, a less processed diet
with more nutrient-dense and healthier foods. To prevent
future problems and to provide for those with nutrition-
related noncommunicable diseases, be they obesity, dia-
betes, a cancer, or others, it is imperative to improve
dietary patterns around the world. Focusing on medical
treatments, smoking reduction, and regulating sodium in
the diet will not halt the rising epidemic of obesity and
many other cardiometabolic problems or all of the related
economic, health, and other consequences facing low-
and middle-income countries, in particular. Eﬀective
action requires evidence-based, carefully evaluated pro-
grams and policies. This review summarizes a great deal
of work that has occurred over the past half century in
response to concerns about the rapid dietary shifts occur-
ring in stages around the world.

Abstract
Background: Observational studies have suggested a complex relationship between alcohol consumption and stroke, 
dependent on sex, type of stroke and outcome (morbidity vs. mortality). We undertook a systematic review and a 
meta-analysis of studies assessing the association between levels of average alcohol consumption and relative risks of 
ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes separately by sex and outcome. This meta-analysis is the first to explicitly separate 
morbidity and mortality of alcohol-attributable stroke and thus has implications for public health and prevention.
Methods: Using Medical Subject Headings (alcohol drinking, ethanol, cerebrovascular accident, cerebrovascular 
disorders, and intracranial embolism and thrombosis and the key word stroke), a literature search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, 
CINAHL, CABS, WHOlist, SIGLE, ETOH, and Web of Science databases between 1980 to June 2009 was performed 
followed by manual searches of bibliographies of key retrieved articles. From twenty-six observational studies (cohort 
or case-control) with ischemic or hemorrhagic strokes the relative risk or odds ratios or hazard ratios of stroke 
associated with alcohol consumption were reported; alcohol consumption was quantified; and life time abstention 
(manually estimated where data for current abstainers were given) was used as the reference group. Two reviewers 
independently extracted the information on study design, participant characteristics, level of alcohol consumption, 
stroke outcome, control for potential confounding factors, risk estimates and key criteria of study quality using a 
standardized protocol.
Results: The dose-response relationship for hemorrhagic stroke had monotonically increasing risk for increasing 
consumption, whereas ischemic stroke showed a curvilinear relationship, with a protective effect of alcohol for low to 
moderate consumption, and increased risk for higher exposure. For more than 3 drinks on average/day, in general 
women had higher risks than men, and the risks for mortality were higher compared to the risks for morbidity.
Conclusions: These results indicate that heavy alcohol consumption increases the relative risk of any stroke while light 
or moderate alcohol consumption may be protective against ischemic stroke. Preventive measures that should be 
initiated are discussed.

Background
Stroke is an international health problem with high asso-
ciated human and economic costs. Among adults, it is the
second-leading  cause  of  death  worldwide,  and  ranks
fourth  in  overall  disease  burden.  Recent  trend  analysis
showed  that  stroke  incidence  and  associated  deaths
appears to be rising, particularly in economically emerg-

ing countries [1,2]. Recent projections suggest that, with-
out intervention, the number of deaths from stroke will
continue rising, to 6.5 million in 2015 and 7.8 million by
2030, with the vast bulk/majority in poor countries [3].
Risk factor identification and analysis is therefore a high
priority  in  various  fields  of  stroke  research  and  will  be
important in containing and reducing this heavy disease
burden.

It is well accepted that heavy alcohol consumption has
been  linked  to  an  increased  risk  of  ischemic  stroke  [4]

and hemorrhagic stroke [4-6]. However, some studies of
moderate alcohol and stroke reported a protective effect
of alcohol at these doses [4,7-9] while others have found
that  moderate  consumption  increases  the  overall  risk
[5,10]. What's more, the only meta-analyses on the sub-
ject  only  focus  on  mortality  from  stroke,  even  though
morbidity is much more common for this event and alco-
hol  may  have  a  differential  role  in  fatal  and  non-fatal
events [11,12]. This study will attempt to systematically
estimate  the  impact  of  alcohol  for  stroke  separately  by
event outcome and provide estimates by level of alcohol
consumption via meta-analysis.

Methods
Search Strategy
We  conducted  a  systematic  literature  search  of  MED-
LINE,  EMBASE,  CINAHL,  CABS,  WHOlist,  SIGLE,
ETOH, and Web of Science for relevant original papers
from January 1980 to first week of June 2009. We used the
following  keywords  and  medical  subject  headings  to
identify relevant articles in electronic databases: (alcohol
or ethanol) AND (stroke* or cerebrovascular* or intracra-
nial  embolism  or  thrombosis)  AND  (case  or  cohort  or
ratio  or  risk*  or  prospective*  or  follow*).  No  language
restrictions were applied. Generally, studies were eligible
for  inclusion  if  they  were  original  publications  (we
excluded letters, editorials, conference abstracts, reviews,
and  comments)  of  case-control  and  cohort  studies
reporting incidence, hazard ratio (HR), relative risk (RR)
or odds ratio (OR) of alcohol consumption in comparison
to no alcohol consumption. In addition, bibliographies of
key retrieved articles, relevant reviews and meta-analyses
were hand searched.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria
To  be  included  in  our  meta-analysis,  a  published  study
had to meet the following criteria: (1) had to be an origi-
nal research study (not a review); (2) cohort or case-con-
trol  study  in  which  medically  confirmed  ischemic  or
hemorrhagic  stroke  were  end  points  (i.e.,  not  self-
reported endpoint); (3) reporting of RRs or ORs or HRs
(or data to calculate these risks) of stroke associated with
alcohol consumption compared to abstention; (4) having
three  or  more  alcohol  drinking  exposure  groups  (i.e.,
dose-response information was required).

Data Extraction
All  data  were  independently  abstracted  by  means  of  a
standardized  protocol.  Study  characteristics  recorded
were as follows: title, lead author name, year, and source
of  publication,  country  of  origin,  study  design  (cohort
study or case-control study), characteristics of the study
population (sample size; sampling methods; and distribu-
tion  of  age,  average  age  at  baseline,  sex,  and  ethnicity),

measures of outcome and exposure (the number of cases
at each exposure level, the total population at risk at each
exposure  level),  duration  of  follow-up  (for  prospective
cohort  studies),  confounding  factors  controlled  for  by
matching or adjustment, and the RR (or OR or HR) and
the corresponding lower and upper 95% confidence inter-
vals  of  stroke  types,  assessment  of  current  or  life  time
abstention, and level of alcohol consumption. RRs were
abstracted by sex, subtype of stroke (ischemic or hemor-
rhagic),  end  point  incidence  (mortality,  morbidity),  and
level  of  alcohol  consumption.  If  studies  only  reported
results  for  both  sexes  combined,  the  same  results  were
applied  to  both  female  and  male  datasets.  Similarly,  if
combined results were reported for mortality and mor-
bidity studies, the same results were applied to both mor-
tality and morbidity datasets.

To  ensure  accuracy  in  data  abstraction,  five  included
and  five  excluded  studies  were  randomly  chosen  to  be
abstracted independently by a co-author (HI). There was
a  93.6%  overall  agreement  between  the  2  independent
raters. For data abstraction the raters agreed on 92.0% of
possible  data  points,  and  95.2%  with  respect  to  quality
scoring (data not shown). Where disagreements existed,
both authors discussed the discrepancy until a consensus
was reached.

Standardization of alcohol consumption
Where  consumption  was  reported  in  drinks  and  not
grams, the gram pure alcohol equivalent described in the
article was used as a conversion factor if stated, and if not,
conversion  from  standard  drinks  was  based  on  geogra-
phy: for Canada 13.6 grams, the UK 8 grams, the USA 12
grams and in both New Zealand and Australia 10 grams
of pure alcohol were assumed based on the literature [13].
For all other countries without clear standard drink spec-
ifications 12 grams pure alcohol was used. For those stud-
ies  [4,6,9,10,14-18]  that  did  not  report  measures  of
association separately by sex, the estimates were used for
men as well as women. Information on alcohol consump-
tion was extracted. When ranges of alcohol consumption
were given, the midpoint was taken. In cases where no
upper bound for the highest category was given, 3/4 of
the length of the immediate previous category range was
added to the lower bound and was used as the measure.

Correction for lifetime abstention
If a study only reported RR relative to current abstention,
the  risk  estimate  and  95%  confidence  intervals  were
adjusted to  lifetime  abstention. Studies reporting RR of
ex-drinkers  relative  to  lifetime  abstainers  [14,15,19-24]
were  grouped  together  by  sex  and  a  pooled  RR  for  ex-
drinkers  was  determined.  In  addition,  the  ratio  of  ex-
drinkers relative to lifetime abstainers in this pooled esti-
mate was calculated. For those studies only reporting cur-

rent abstention, the proportion of lifetime abstainers and
ex-drinkers was estimated based on the ratio of ex-drink-
ers previously calculated and the RRs in each article were
adjusted based on the pooled RR. This was done to avoid
the  "sick-quitter  effect",  a  situation  where  previously
heavy  drinkers  who  had  stopped  drinking  because  of
health  reasons  confound  the  true  RR  for  abstainers  by
artificially inflating the lifetime abstainers' RR for stroke,
although people might have stopped drinking for other
reasons as well [25].

[26] 

to  estimate 

Statistical Analysis
The  dose-response  relationship  between  alcohol  con-
sumption and risk of strokes was assessed with random
effects meta-regression models. Based on previously pub-
lished  research,  the  association  between  alcohol  con-
sumption and stroke was expected to be both linear and
non-linear, depending on the subtype. Alcohol consump-
tion was modeled as a continuous variable using the frac-
tional  polynomial  method 
the
relationship between alcohol consumption and the loga-
rithmized RR of stroke subtypes. In order to be flexible in
fitting the best model, we conducted the meta-regression
using linear as well as first-order and second-order frac-
tional polynomials with powers of -2, -1, -0.5, 0, 0.5, 1, 2,
and 3 to estimate a best fitting curve to the data. All mod-
els were fitted in STATA using the GLST function sepa-
rately for sex and outcome. Best-fit curves or lines were
assessed using standard goodness-of-fit statistics with an
emphasis on reduced deviance (gain) compared with the
quadratic  model.  Comparisons  of  curves  to  determine
the best fit were made using a Chi-square distribution, as
recommended by Royston [27].

Statistical  heterogeneity  among  studies  was  assessed
using both the Cochrane Q test and the I2 statistic. For
the Q-statistic, a p-value of < 0.10 was considered to be
representative of statistically significant heterogeneity. I2
ranges between 0% and 100% and describes the percent-
age of total variation across studies that is due to hetero-
geneity.  A  value  of  zero 
indicates  no  observed
heterogeneity, and larger values show increasing hetero-
geneity  [28,29].  Publication  bias  was  assessed  by  visual
inspection of Begg's funnel plot [30] and by applying two
statistical  tests:  Begg-Mazumdar  adjusted  rank  correla-
tion  test  [31],  and  the  Egger regression  asymmetry  test
[30]. A p-value of < 0.10 was considered to be representa-
tive of statistically significant publication bias.

All  analyses  were  conducted  using  STATA  software

version 10.1 [32].

Results
We  identified  26  studies  that  met  the  inclusion  criteria
outlined in Figure 1. There were 17 cohort studies [5,14-
16,19-24,33-39]  and  9  case-control  studies 
[4,6,8-

10,17,18,40,41] (See Figure 1). Four previous systematic
reviews [12,42-44] and seven meta-analyses [45-51] were
identified and excluded; some meta-analytic studies were
published either as an iteration [46] or as an update [43]
from past studies.

Study Characteristics
The characteristics of the study subjects and design of the
studies  are  presented  in  Additional  files  1  and  2.  The
number  of  subjects  in  the  cohort  studies  ranged  from
1621 in the study by Kiyohara et al [16] to 107,137 in the
study by Klatsky et al [19]. Among all cohort studies, 13
studies 
ischemic
stroke,  and  12  studies  [5,15,16,19,22-24,33,34,36,38,39];
reported  hemorrhagic  stroke  as  the  outcome.  Similarly,
15 studies [5,15,16,20-24,33-39] had mortality as the end
point;  whereas  11  studies  [5,14,16,19-21,23,33,34,36,37]
had morbidity as end point. The follow-up period ranged
from 4 to 30 years.

[14,16,19-21,23,24,34-38] 

The  number  of case  subjects  enrolled  in  case-control
studies ranged from 82 in the study by Henrich & Hor-
witz [40] to 677 in the study by Sacco and colleagues [18]
and the corresponding number of control subjects ranged
from 153 in the study by Palomaki & Kaste [41] to 1139 in
the  study  by  Sacco  and  colleagues  [18].  Seven  studies
[4,8-10,18,40,41] collected data on ischemic stroke and 4
studies  [4,6,9,17]  collected  data  on  hemorrhagic  stroke.
Three studies [6,17,18] had mortality as the end point and
9 studies [4,6,8-10,17,18,40,41] had morbidity as an end
point.

Heterogeneity assessment by stroke type
Hemorrhagic stroke
For both men and women morbidity datasets, there was
significant heterogeneity between studies (men: Q-statis-
tic  (df)  =  87.7  (39),  p  =  0.000;  I2 =  56,  95%  CI:  37-69;
women: Q-statistic = 34.0, p = 0.005; I2 = 53, 95% CI: 18-
73) (See Figures 2). Publication bias was not detected by
either  Begg's  (p  >  0.05)  or  Egger's  (p  >  0.05)  tests  for
either  men  or  women.  Moreover,  the  "trim  and  fill"
method did not produce any additional studies, further
corroborating that there was no publication bias.

Similarly,  in  the  mortality  datasets,  there  was  signifi-
cant heterogeneity (Q-statistic = 63.5(38), p = 0.006; I2 =
40,  95%  CI:  12-59)  among  men  but  not  among  women
(Q-statistic = 21.0 (16), p = 0.179; I2 = 24, 95% CI: 0-58)
(See Figure 3). No publication bias was detected by either
Begg's (p > 0.05) or Egger's (p > 0.05) tests or the "trim
and fill" method.
Ischemic stroke
In terms of morbidity, there were significant heterogene-
ities found among both men (Q-statistic(df) = 84.3(55), p
=  0.0067;  I2 =  35,  95%  CI:  9-53)  and  women  (Q-statis-
tic(df) = 45.5(26), p = 0.0104; I2 = 43, 95% CI: 10-64) (See

detected by any methodology. For ischemic stroke mor-
tality,  there  were  no  significant  heterogeneities  found
among men (Q-statistic(df) = 40.0(36), p = 0.2966; I2 = 10,
95% CI: 0-40) or women (Q-statistic(df) = 15.5(14), p =
0.3436; I2 = 10, 95% CI: 0-47) (See Figures 5). Again, there
was no publication bias.

Dose-response relationship
A total of 44 models (8 first-order models and 36 second-
order  fractional  polynomials),  were  examined  for  each

stroke (ischemic and hemorrhagic) by sex and outcome.
Figures  6  and  7  show  the  fitted  curves  of  the  dose-
response  relationship  between  alcohol  and  stroke  sub-
types by sex and by end point.
Haemorrhagic stroke
The  overall  results  indicated  a  positive  association
between  heavy  alcohol  consumption  and  RR  of  hemor-
rhagic-stroke  mortality,  irrespective  of  sex  (Figure  6).
Compared to the reference group of lifetime abstainers,

Figure 3 Forest plot of risk estimates for alcohol consumption related to haemorrhagic stroke of women by endpoint (8 studies).

2.47-8.20) were calculated for men and women, respec-
tively. Similarly, the risk of hemorrhagic-stroke morbidity
for men also resulted in a monotonic relationship, almost
linear on a logarithmized scale (RR = 2.52 at 10 drinks per
day,  95%  CI:  1.74-3.64).  For  women,  the  curve  was  J-
shaped; there was a protective effect of moderate drink-
ing up to 36 grams of pure alcohol or about 3 drinks a day.
The nadir was reached at less than 1 drink per day (RR:
0.69, 95% CI: 0.54-0.89) (also see Additional file 3).
Ischemic stroke
On  the  other  hand,  an  overall  nonlinear  association
between alcohol consumption and RR of ischemic-stroke
was  observed.  The  association  between  alcohol  con-
sumption  and  RR  of  ischemic-stroke  mortality  had  a  J-
shaped relationship irrespective of sex or end points (Fig-
ure  7).  Relative  to  the  lifetime  male  abstainers,  alcohol
consumption  of  less  than  35  grams/day,  or  less  than  3

drinks per day based on US conversions, was significantly
associated with a decreased RR of ischemic-stroke. The
risk  curve  had  a  global  minimum  (RR  =  0.86,  95%  CI:
0.81-0.93) for 12 grams or pure alcohol or 1 drink per day.
For women, the lowest risk of mortality was among those
consuming less than 12 grams/day, or about 1 drink/day.
Protective  effects  were  evident  up  to  44  grams/day
(almost 4 drinks per day) (RR of 5.61, 95% CI: 3.12-10.09
for 12 standard drinks a day) (also see Additional file 3).
Similarly, the risk of ischemic-stroke morbidity for both
sexes resulted  in  a J-shaped  curve  as  well. There was  a
protective effect up to 37 grams/day (about 3 drinks/day)
among  men  and  46  grams/day  (or  about  4  drinks/day)
among  women  observed.  For  12  drinks/day,  the  risk  of
ischemic-stroke morbidity was highest at RR = 1.60 (95%
CI: 1.38-1.86) among men and RR = 2.15 (95% CI: 1.62-
2.86) among women.

Figure 4 Forest plot of risk estimates for alcohol consumption related to ischemic stroke of men by endpoint (18 studies).

To  assess  whether  the  heterogeneity  of  study  results
may have been due to differences in the study's endpoint
of stroke mortality or morbidity, we created an interac-
tion (product) term between the type of endpoint under
consideration (1 for mortality and 0 for morbidity) and
the dose variable (alcohol consumption), and included it
in  the  model  for  each  sex.  The  interaction  term  for
women was significant in both hemorrhagic (X2 = 6.06, df
= 1, p = 0.0138) and ischemic stroke (X2 = 8.52, df = 1, p =
0.0141), suggesting that the effect of alcohol consumption
was different in mortality compared with morbidity stud-
ies (See Figures 6a and 7a). However, the interaction term
was not significant among men.

The findings from the sensitivity analyses based on dif-
ferent exclusion criteria are presented in Additional file 4.
Risk estimates changed very little after the exclusion of: a)
studies  without  computed  tomography  (CT)  scans  or
other imaging measures; b) studies that did not adjust for
important confounders (age, smoking and hypertension);
c) or studies fulfilling criteria a) or b).

Discussion
Overall, the present findings suggest a consistent associa-
tion between heavy drinking and risk for stroke subtypes,
whereas the evidence linking moderate consumption (1-2
drinks/day) appears to have mixed results.

Figure 5 Forest plot of risk estimates for alcohol consumption related to ischemic stroke of women by endpoint (11 studies).

The curvilinear relationship for ischemic stroke resem-
bles the dose-response relationship between alcohol and
ischemic  heart  disease  [52]  with  the  same  postulated
underlying  biological  mechanisms  [53-55].  For  hemor-
rhagic stroke, hypertension plays a more prominent role
in the etiology. Alcohol, already operant at low doses, has
been  identified  as  a  major  risk  factor  for  hypertension
[56], and might explain the different dose-response rela-
tionship [45,48].

One of the main results of this study is the difference
between  mortality  and morbidity  as  an  endpoint,  espe-
cially for women. While higher effects of alcohol on mor-
tality compared to morbidity have been demonstrated for
other chronic disease (e.g., liver cirrhosis [57] and injury
[50], most meta-analyses in this area do not differentiate

between these endpoints. Both for questions of etiology
and prevention, however, such a distinction is necessary.
We conducted a meta-regression as a sensitivity analy-
sis for each stroke type to measure the impact of study
type (case control vs. cohort) as a potential covariate on
the shape of the curve. We found that the shape of associ-
ation  remained  unchanged  for  both  hemorrhagic  (p  =
0.170) and ischemic stroke (p = 0.589) (data on RR not
shown).

This analysis is subject to general strengths and limita-
tions of meta-analyses, in addition to some subject-spe-
cific issues. Of the former, a major limitation is that the
quality of our study depends on data from original publi-
cations  included  in  our  analysis.  Our  study  may  thus
inherit some problems of potential bias and confounding

effects associated with observational studies. However, a
randomized controlled trial of alcohol consumption and
stroke has not been performed and is highly unlikely to
be  conducted  in  the  future  for  ethical  reasons.  Conse-
quently, we must rely on data from observational studies
to draw conclusions and make recommendations.

Of  the  latter,  a  limitation  is  that  CT  scans  and  other
imaging  techniques  were  not  available  for  some  of  the

studies [5,14,19,22,35,36,38,58]. At present, a CT scan is
the most reliable method of distinguishing between hem-
orrhagic and ischemic strokes [59,60], but unfortunately
these studies primarily used autopsy report, death certifi-
cates, or death registry data to make diagnoses and deter-
mine  the  outcome  of  stroke  subtypes.  However,  given
that the dose-response curve differed by type of stroke,
any bias introduced would dilute such a difference. Addi-

tionally, our sensitivity analysis showed little difference as
the shape of association remained unchanged.

Second, the selection of the reference group may vary
among studies [61]. For instance, some studies used the
lowest  consumption  level  as  the  reference  group  while
others  used  abstainers.  It  has  been  suggested  that  the
non-linear  association  of  between  alcohol  consumption
and mortality from cardiovascular diseases could be due
to  the  inclusion  of  ex-drinkers  in  the  referent  group  of
abstainers  [25,62,63].  To  avoid  combining  studies  that
were not comparable, we chose to correct the RR from
studies  based  on  current  abstention  by  introducing  the
effect for former drinkers based on a meta-analyses of the
studies where former drinkers were separated from life-
time  abstainers.  We  calculated  this  correction  for  fatal
and non-fatal outcomes combined to achieve more stable
results, which may have biased the current results. How-
ever,  our  estimates  of  about  21%  of  males  and  4%  of
females being ex-drinkers falls in line with the literature,
and may even be an underestimate, meaning the results
of this study would be conservative.

Finally,  assessment  methods  for  alcohol  consumption
may vary among studies. Alcohol consumption is usually
measured by self-reported alcohol drinking habits. Such
data are subject to recall bias. For example, heavy drink-
ers may be more likely to underreport their alcohol con-
sumption  or  respondents  simply  forget  about  their
consumption  in  retrospective  recalls,  which  tends  to
result in an underestimation of alcohol consumption [64-
66].

Conclusions
Overall, our study showed differential impact of alcohol
consumption  on  both  type  and  outcome  of  stroke.
Clearly, to reduce the risk of stroke, any heavy consump-
tion of alcohol should be avoided. With respect to moder-
ate consumption of up to 3 drinks, the results are mixed:
moderate  consumption  seem  to  be  protective  for  isch-
emic stroke only, but slightly detrimental or at best neu-
tral for hemorrhagic stroke. In line with the results on the
cardio-protective effect of alcohol including the evidence
on biological pathways [53,67], it seems reasonable that
the protective effect on ischemic stroke is limited to peo-
ple who not only on average drink moderately, but who
also avoid heavy drinking occasions [55].

Finally, we would like to point out the implications of
our  findings  for  global  public  health.  With  stroke  cur-
rently being one of the most important causes of death
and burden of disease (see above), and with the exposure
to alcohol projected to increase proportionately to/with
increases in wealth [68], alcohol-attributable stroke bur-
den will continue to increase globally without an effort to
increase effective alcohol control measures [69]. Overall,
we  recognize  that  total  abstention,  while  beneficial  for

some stroke subtype, is advocated to reduce total mortal-
ity and morbidity, including that from injury. For the car-
dio-protective  effects,  however,  we  recommend  that
drinking alcohol be limited to 2 or less drinks per day.

Abstract
Introduction: Cardiovascular disease remains the commonest health problem in developed countries, and residual risk after implementing all
current therapies is still high. The use of marine omega-3 fatty acids (DHA and EPA) has been recommended to reduce cardiovascular risk by
multiple mechanisms. Objectives: To update the current evidence on the inﬂuence of omega-3 on the rate of cardiovascular events. Review
Methods: We used the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases to identify clinical trials and randomized controlled trials of omega-3 fatty acids
(with quantiﬁed quantities) either in capsules or in dietary intake, compared to placebo or usual diet, equal to or longer than 6 months,
and written in English. The primary outcome was a cardiovascular event of any kind and secondary outcomes were all-cause mortality,
cardiac death and coronary events. We used RevMan 5·1 (Mantel-Haenszel method). Heterogeneity was assessed by the I2 and Chi2 tests.
We included 21 of the 452 pre-selected studies. Results: We found an overall decrease of risk of suffering a cardiovascular event of any
kind of 10 % (OR 0·90; [0·85 – 0·96], p ¼ 0·001), a 9 % decrease of risk of cardiac death (OR 0·91; [0·83 – 0·99]; p ¼ 0·03), a decrease of coronary
events (fatal and non-fatal) of 18 % (OR 0·82; [0·75 – 0·90]; p , 1 £ 1024), and a trend to lower total mortality (5 % reduction of risk; OR 0·95;
[0·89 –1·02]; p ¼ 0·15. Most of the studies analyzed included persons with high cardiovascular risk. Conclusions: marine omega-3 fatty acids
are effective in preventing cardiovascular events, cardiac death and coronary events, especially in persons with high cardiovascular risk.

Key words: omega 3: n3: cardiovascular disease

Out of all the proposed beneﬁcial effects on health of long
chain omega-3 fatty acids, those affecting cardiovascular dis-
ease are, nowadays, those that receive more attention in clini-
cal medicine. Evidence from epidemiological, observational
and clinical trial studies have led the American Heart Associ-
ation (AHA) to recommend their consumption, and thus
omega-3 fatty acids have emerged as real players in the pre-
(mainly coronary) events(1,2).
vention of cardiovascular
These recommendations include two servings of blue ﬁsh a
week for the general population (to achieve a mean of
500 mg/d), and 1 g/d of marine omega-3 (EPA and DHA) in
patients with coronary disease. As
the contribution of
omega-3 in the diet of many Western countries is far below
the recommended ﬁgures, there is a clear need to increase
their consumption. Although the inclusion of novel agents
in the therapeutic guidelines of the AHA scientiﬁc committee
is reserved for those interventions whose effectiveness and
safety is beyond all doubt, controversial results have been
published in recent
reviews and meta-analysis reporting
both positive and negative ﬁndings on the effectiveness of
omega-3 fatty acids(3 – 6).

Research into omega-3 fatty acids has evolved from studies
where their activity was tested, to a more complex scenario,
where authors look for the potential underlying mechanisms
that may be causing these effects. In other words, authors
have switched from a perspective in which they treated to
show the effects of omega-3 to another in which they aim to
show how they work. Furthermore, this may lead to a bias
when trying to evaluate the efﬁcacy of
the intervention,
which is theoretically yet to be proven. Scientists may well
think that journals are not very eager to include articles that
show ‘again’ that omega-3 fatty acids are effective, instead
of why they are so. Actually, research in this ﬁeld is extremely
active in this moment. A prior examination of the studies
reported in PubMed regarding omega-3 fatty acids and cardio-
vascular disease or cardiovascular risk factors accounted for
more than seventy thousand items. Over the last four years,
the production of such studies has doubled (Fig. 1). In this
extremely active context,
is therefore not surprising that
those studies that summarize the overall scientiﬁc information
available at a given moment tend to modify their opinion
depending on the articles included.

Fig. 1. Published items: Clinical trials, reviews and meta-analysis, involving studies on omega-3 fatty acids and cardiovascular events or cardiovascular risk fac-
tors, based on the 494 items (452 clinical trials and 42 reviews and meta-analysis) found pertinent for this review (pre-selected).

In the present review, we will summarize the information
available as of January 20th, 2012, on the effects of omega-3
fatty acids on cardiovascular events, evaluating the evidence
from clinical
trials and randomized controlled trials. With
this purpose in mind, we will conduct a search for recent
reviews and meta-analysis, and a primary search for original
clinical trials and randomized controlled trials.

Types of outcome measurements

Primary outcome. Odds
ratio of cardiovascular events
(deﬁned as stroke, coronary events, myocardial infarction or
angina, peripheral limb disease event or death from cardiovas-
cular causes).

Secondary outcomes. Odds ratio for total mortality, car-
diac death or total coronary events (both fatal and non-fatal).

Material and methods

Search methods for identiﬁcation of studies

The research question applied to the systematic review was
‘Are marine omega-3 fatty acids useful for reducing the inci-
dence of total death, cardiovascular death coronary events
or cardiovascular events?’ This article is limited to long chain
(also called marine) omega-3. We did not review the effects
of other omega-3 fatty acids. We focused only on clinical
trials and randomized controlled trials. We limited our search
to trials with a follow-up of 6 months or more.

The search strategy for the identiﬁcation of the studies is sum-
marized in Fig. 2. The review included articles written in Eng-
lish, and published before January 20th, 2012. We used the
two most commonly used electronic databases (Medline via
PubMed and EMBASE), and combined search terms for
omega-3 fatty acids (Omega-3 OR omega 3 OR polyunsatu-
rated fatty acid OR pufa OR eicosapentanoic acid OR EPA
OR ethyl eicosapentaenoic acid OR eepa OR docosahexanoic

OR coronary OR stroke OR peripheral limb disease OR per-

for reviews and meta-analysis
articles (published after January 1st, 2000).

Study selection

When analyzing reviews and meta-analyses,
the authors
decided whether the item was pertinent or not, based on
the title and abstract reading. If pertinent,
the referenced
articles included in the item (review or meta-analysis) were
passed to the list of potential articles to include in this
review. When evaluating the clinical trials and randomized
controlled trials, the authors made an initial decision on the
pertinence of the article and whether it should remain on
the list based on the title and abstract reading, with the follow-
ing inclusion and exclusion criteria:

(1) Inclusion criteria. Randomized controlled trials and
clinical trials which directly assessed the impact of the intake
of measured quantities of marine omega-3 fatty acids (either
in the form of foods or supplements or capsules) on any of
the MeSH terms used for deﬁning clinical outcomes, for at
least 6 months.

Studies which reported total deaths and, at least, one of the
following: Cardiovascular mortality, acute (fatal and/or non-
fatal) myocardial infarction (AMI), angina, revascularization,
stroke (fatal and/or non-fatal), left ventricle function.

pertinent, a third author (F. P-J) rated the article, and decided
on the pertinence.

Study analysis

Statistical analysis was performed using Review Manager
5·017 (Cochrane Collaboration, Oxford, UK). We assessed
heterogeneity between studies using Chi2 indicating signiﬁ-
cant heterogeneity and I2 with suggested thresholds for low
(25 % – 49 %), moderate (50 % – 75 %), and high (.75 %)
values. We used the ﬁxed effects model as default, and the
random effects model when heterogeneity between studies
was high for the end point of interest. For all analyses, we
considered p # 0·05 (2-sided) as signiﬁcant. Summary effect
estimates are presented as an odds ratio (OR) with 95 % con-
ﬁdence intervals (CI). Overall effect was assessed by the Z test.
We used the Mantel-Haenszel statistical methods for analysis.
For cardiovascular events, we considered all components of
coronary events, stroke, cardiac death, or peripheral vascular
disease events, when available from the articles, irrespective
of whether the article included all or some of them.

Self-quality assessment

We used the Quality of Reporting of Meta-Analyses
(QUOROM) guidelines to perform the self-quality assessment
of the present work. This ﬁle can be located in the manuscript
(Supplementary Table 1).

(2) Exclusion criteria. Articles written in languages other

Results

than English.

Sub-studies of other studies that qualify for inclusion.
Studies in which a-linolenic acid (ALA) was present as an

active means of treatment.

Studies in which the methodology described in the title/

abstract showed critical concerns.

Studies in which the omega-3 fatty acids were part of
another concomitant treatment, not applied to the group not
receiving omega-3.

Studies in which another active treatment was tested in

synergy with omega-3.

Studies in which the intake of omega-3 was not measured or

estimated in g/d.

Studies limited to populations with ophthalmologic, obste-
tric, oncological, gynecologic, renal, neurological or psychia-
tric disorders.

(3) Eligibility. Eligible patients were men and women
aged 18 years or older who were involved in any of the
studies which met the inclusion criteria and did not fulﬁll
any exclusion criteria.

The two authors who validated the studies that appeared in
the ﬁrst search (J. D-L and P. P-M) rated all the articles as per-
tinent or non-pertinent. Pertinent articles were measured
against the Jadad Scale for quality score(7). A score equal or
lower to 2/5 in the Jadad score led to the article’s withdrawal
from the list. Where only one of the authors rated the article as

The search for clinical trials and randomized controlled trials
resulted in 3246 articles, of which 332 were found pertinent.
The search for reviews and meta-analysis in omega-3 resulted
in 691 articles, of which 42 were found pertinent. The evalu-
ation of the references of these articles led to the inclusion
of 120 additional references. A total of 452 articles passed
the ﬁrst evaluation stage on pertinence. Further evaluation
of these articles, submission to inclusion and exclusion criteria
and to the Jadad Scale led to the ﬁnal number of 21 articles
that are included in the analysis(8 – 28). This is illustrated as a
ﬂow-chart in Fig. 2.

(A1) Effects on cardiovascular events

Cardiovascular events were reported in 14 of the selected
studies, involving 45 285 participants. Cardiovascular events
were lower in the omega-3 group, with 3902 events in
22 669 participants in the omega-3 arm and 4102 events in
22 616 participants in the control group (OR 0·90;
[0·85 –
0·96]); Z ¼ 3·28, p ¼ 0·001 (Fig. 3). We found medium hetero-
geneity in this group (Chi2 ¼ 27·77; I2 ¼ 53 %). Two studies,
Burr 2003 and Nodari 2011, caused the largest part of the het-
erogeneity, accounting for 29 % and 14 % of the I2 index,
respectively. Furthermore, excluding these 2 studies resulted
in an I2 ¼ 0 %.

(A2) Effects on total mortality

Seventeen studies described at least one death and reported
total mortality (50 468 participants). Pooled total mortality of
all studies reported 2205 deaths in 25 288 participants in the
omega-3 group and 2283 deaths in 25 180 participants in the
control group, resulting in an OR of 0·95 (0·89 – 1·02) with a
trend towards lower mortality for the Omega-3 group (Z for
overall effect 1·45, p ¼ 0·15) (Fig. 4). There was no evidence
of signiﬁcant heterogeneity of results (Chi2 ¼ 22·17; p ¼ 0·14;
I2 ¼ 28 %). Again, the Burr 2003 study showed a divergence
of results, accounting for 18 % of the 28 % of the I2 index.

(A3) Effects on cardiac death

Of the 21 articles included in the present review, 13 reported
cardiac deaths, of a total of 46 737 participants. The number of
cardiac deaths reported was 1108 in 23 409 persons in the
omega-3 group and 1198 in 23 328 in the control group.
This yielded an OR of 0·91 indicating a lower cardiac death
in the omega-3 group (CI 0·83 – 0·99; Z for overall effect
2·13; p ¼ 0·03) (Fig. 5). Evidence of heterogeneity was not
found (Chi2 ¼ 17·62; p ¼ 0·13). I2 index (32 %) was mainly
inﬂuenced by the GISSI-Prevenzione 1999 (15 %), and the
Burr 2003 (32 %) studies.

(A4) Coronary events

Coronary events were reported in 12 studies, from a total of
41 560 patients. These studies reported a total of 889 coronary
events (in 20 792 persons) in the omega-3 group and 1066
events in the control group (in 20 768). These numbers

Discussion

In the present article we reviewed the evidence from random-
ized controlled trials and clinical trials involving the use of
omega-3 fatty acids for at
least six months until January
20th, 2012. In total, of 452 initial potential items, 21 studies
matched the inclusion and exclusion criteria and ranked 3/5
or higher on the Jadad Scale(8 – 28) (Table 1). As a primary out-
come, we observed that the use of omega-3 results in a fall of
approximately 10 % in cardiovascular events (OR 0·90; [0·85 –
0·96]); Z ¼ 3·28, p ¼ 0·001). We also observed lower frequency
of cardiac death (OR 0·91; [0·83 – 0·99]; Z for overall effect 2·13;
p ¼ 0·03), and coronary events (OR of 0·82 (0·75 – 0·90),
Z ¼ 4·17; p , 1 £ 1024). Although we did not ﬁnd differences
in total mortality, there was a trend towards a lower mortality
in omega-3 users (OR of 0·95 [0·89 – 1·02], Z ¼ 1·45, p ¼ 0·15).
We did not stratify the populations according to risk, and
included all participants in the same equation, which implies
that,
in fact, a greater effect of omega-3 could have been
obtained if the population is reduced to secondary prevention
only. However, we wanted to include the as much information
available from the current data as possible.

We excluded from the present study a recent study by
Kromhout et al, which evaluated the effect of marine
omega-3, ALA or placebo on the incidence of cardiovascular
events after AMI(29). The study was well designed and con-
ducted, but used ALA as an active arm, which we excluded
from this study. Furthermore, the methodology of the statisti-
cal approximation made it impossible to compare directly the
effects of marine omega-3 versus placebo, when ALA is
excluded from the analysis.

Most of the studies analyzed in the present work showed an
intriguing uniformity in the direction of their results. The
divergent results of one study (Burr et al, 2003)(19) are particu-
larly interesting, as they served as a mirror image for nearly all
the outcomes. In fact, all
the studies
showed a low rate of inter-assay heterogeneity I2 (below
25 %), when this study was excluded. Actually, we performed
an alternative examination of
the results excluding this
study, and as well as increasing all the signiﬁcant ﬁndings

the outcomes of all

on cardiovascular events, cardiac death and coronary events,
we found a signiﬁcant change in the total mortality outcome,
by lowering the OR to 0·93, 0·87 – 0·99, Z ¼ 2·18; p ¼ 0·03). It
is not easy to work out the explanation for this fact. Some
authors have recently reported methodological issues during
this study(3,30 – 33), such as a transient cessation of the study
for a year due to lack of funds, or the fact that participants
were not uniformly randomized to omega-3 supplements,
and that these were only given to the participants who entered

the study after a one-year break, which could have created a
bias. Some of the authors who recently conducted meta-ana-
lyses even excluded the Burr study(3,30,32). We agree that
such issues place limitations on the article, but do not go as
far as to discredit it: hence, we have included it. We excluded
just one study on methodological grounds, on the light of pre-
vious reports(34 – 36).

All the results coming from reviews and meta-analyses (and
so the ones coming from this work) have to be accepted with
caution, due to the fact that the number of studies included
are hardly ever designed with the same type of patients,
under the same conditions, or with the same intervention.
The present study offers results from studies coming from
different sets of patients (primary, secondary prevention,
spanning over a large range of ages, some of them only
accepting men, others only involving persons about
to
undergo revascularization. . .), and with remarkable differ-
ences in the treatment doses (ranging from 0·3 to 6·9 g)
(Table 1). Thus, pooling all the participants together may
make it difﬁcult to discriminate effects in subgroups. Further-
more, the size of the study is a critical factor when evaluating
the results of a systematic review or meta-analysis. The fact
that the two GISSI studies are the largest ever conducted
(comprising about 20 000 patients) mean that
the present
article is clearly inﬂuenced by the great difference in size, as
are most of the other studies included. Another fact to be
noted is that the differences in the medication given to the
patients in the different groups may have conditioned the
results of the meta-analysis. For example, the GISSI preven-
zione study was performed in 1999, when some of the current
protocols for the treatment of coronary disease had not been
initiated. The Rauch study, on the other hand, used state-of-
the-art treatment (in 2010) alongside the omega-3 allocation,
and failed to ﬁnd differences in the outcomes depending on
omega-3. This may suggest that the improvements in the clini-
cal outcomes provided by current medication could minimize

the positive effects of omega-3 (Table 1). Nevertheless, the
other recent studies (from 2007 on) showed a similar trend
to the GISSI-prevenzione study, despite including most of
the medication currently used.

intake made by the participants. Moreover,

to be considered
when dealing with the effects of a certain nutrient (or a sub-
stance that may be ingested, such as omega-3 fatty acids) in
health or disease is the possibility that the effects of the ‘con-
trolled’ intake of the nutrient (in this case, omega-3) may be
inﬂuenced by the background diet, and the ‘uncontrolled’
additional
the
average intake of the given nutrient in the different popu-
lations studied may also inﬂuence the results. The effects of
omega-3 in populations where its mean consumption is low
may be higher than in those populations where the dietary
habits include the use of blue ﬁsh as a habitual food. For
example, even ‘control’ subjects, randomized to not receive
supplements of omega-3 in populations like Japan (where
usual diet
than in western
countries(37)), probably have good average omega-3 intake,
when compared to populations with western dietary models,
and, hence, there may be an underestimation of the effects
of omega-3 due to the fact that even ‘control’ subjects are
receiving a good dose of omega-3 via diet. In this sense,
omega-3 supplements for people who have a high dietary
omega-3 intake fail to reduce triglycerides or modify other
plasma lipids(38). In contrast, populations with low average
omega-3 consumption would be theoretically better able to
study the effects of the ‘regulated’ intake of omega-3, given
that
the consumption in normal subjects would be more
sporadic. However, these other models could, on the other
hand, inﬂuence the results of the quantiﬁcation of the effects
of omega-3. In populations with a very low omega-3 intake,
it could occur
that even with the supplementation of
omega-3 (either by dietary or pharmacological means),
omega-3 concentration in plasma would not reach a certain

level, or, furthermore, that the effects of a simple intervention
with a certain amount of omega-3 would not be enough to
counteract the deleterious effects of the global diet. Although
the information provided in many of the studies included in
the present review do not allow us to estimate the omega-3
intake, we included the dietary advice given in these studies
in Table 1. The dietary advice given (when available) does
not seem to inﬂuence the results of the intervention with
omega-3.

Another possible concern when evaluating this particular
topic is the fact that the generalized opinion that omega-3 is
good for health (and in particular cardiovascular disease)
may be inﬂuencing the intake of omega-3 (in the form of
ﬁsh) in the general population, and, more accurately,
in
those persons that suffer from coronary or other cardiovascu-
lar disease. This way, even ‘control’ subjects in randomized
control studies may have a higher ﬁsh consumption than
matched healthy persons in their respective populations, and
subsequently, a lower difference between the ‘active’ and
the ‘placebo’ group would show that even the ‘placebo’
group are receiving (at least partially) the beneﬁcial effects
of their intake of ﬁsh.

Adherence may be an important factor when analyzing the
results, and, in modern studies, persons at secondary preven-
tion receive a large number of medications, especially in the
immediate period following the cardiac event. For example,
in the OMEGA trial(27), which failed to show any effect of
1 g/d of omega-3 in clinical outcomes, more than the 80 %
of the patients were taking over 5 different drugs a day,
apart from the omega capsules. In a recent sub-study from
the JELIS study, adherence was an important determinant of
outcomes(39). The rate of adherence was in itself a determinant
of the clinical outcomes, even within the treatment arm, and
the poor responders had an 80 % possibility of receiving the
the OMEGA investigators
omega-3 pills. Nevertheless,
reported a compliance of 70 % or more in 93 % of
the
it is also worth
omega-3 group. Regarding this last study,
noting also that data from the randomization table shown in
the article allow us to infer an OR for the combined risk of
stroke, previous AMI, previous revascularization, previous
by-pass, or moderate (35 % – 44 %) and severe (, 35 %)
reduction of the ejection fraction of 1·12 (1·04 – 1·20) for the
active treatment (omega-3) versus control. In other words,
the patients allocated to omega-3 were persons at higher
risk (12 %) for the combined items of these conditions(27),
which may have inﬂuenced the ‘negative’ results.

When evaluating the effects of omega-3 fatty acids on clini-
cal outcomes, we are very limited by the time of exposure, the
statistical power and the dosage used in the studies. In fact,
most of the studies ‘designed’ to discriminate clinical end-
points in a short time (less than six months) fail to ﬁnd differ-
ences - probably because the effects would not become
evident until much later. In addition, some of the studies
used doses lower than 0·5 g EPA/DHA, which may not allow
the trigger plasma concentration required for omega-3 effects
to be reached. In other words, some of the beneﬁcial effects
of omega-3 may require a prolonged period (up to years)
at a certain dose.
It has been suggested that although

antithrombosis effects may appear with low doses and a low
time of exposure (weeks), others, like blood pressure regu-
lation,
lowering of triglycerides or lowering of heart rate,
could take anything up to a few years(40). Another important
factor to be pointed is that some of recent studies calculated
their sample size according to expected event rates that
were not achieved. For example, in the recent OMEGA trial
investigators had a statistical power of 19 % to detect differ-
ences of risk reduction of 25 %. As the risk reduction shown
in the omega-3 intake for the clinical outcomes covered in
the present study ranges from 5 – 18 %, the probability of this
study discriminating such differences was extremely low(27).
As an example of the possible infra-treatment and/or low
follow-up, in the GISSI-HF trial, allocation to marine omega-
3 (1 g/d) required a follow-up of at least 3·9 years to ﬁnd
differences in total mortality or cardiovascular events(24). In
our opinion, only the evaluation of clinical events from
long-term exposure to omega-3 fatty acids (up to ten years)
with amounts of at least 1 g EPA/DHA would answer this
question.

Another issue to take into account when evaluating the
apparent disparity of results between studies is population
genetics. It is true that genetic background plays an important
role in many cardiovascular risk factors, like lipid metabolism,
both in fasting and postprandial states(41,42). It is precisely in
the modulation of the lipid proﬁle caused by the intake of
omega-3 that leads some authors to justify the favorable effects
of
these products. Recently, Pishva et al showed how a
mutation in the FABP gene may account for up to 70 % of
the effect of the omega-3 fatty acids on triglyceride levels(43).
Furthermore, Olano-Martin found that the carriers of another
gene mutation at the ApoE locus show an increase in LDL
levels when exposed to a high DHA intake(44). This gene-
diet interaction was also previously published by Caslake(45).
Thus, a different prevalence of gene variations in the popu-
lations submitted to each study may lead to different results
when evaluating outcomes related to the lipid effects of
omega-3.

Although this review is limited to cardiovascular events in
randomized controlled trials and clinical
trials, we also
wanted to remind the reader that many reviews and meta-ana-
lyses have included evidence on the efﬁcacy of omega-3
coming from observational and cohort studies, and most of
them report a much closer inverse relationship between
omega-3 consumption (whether from dietary intake or in
the form of supplements) and cardiovascular disease(4,33,46).
The exact mechanisms by which omega-3 performs its
the main mechanisms
functions are still
lipid proﬁle(48), anti-
proposed are plaque stabilization(47),
failure(24,51), or
inﬂammatory(49), blood pressure(50), heart
anti- arrhythmic properties(20,52,53). It is precisely over this
last effect where major controversy exists today. Initial data
from the GISSI-Prevenzione found that most of the decrease
in mortality associated with the intake of omega-3 could be
due to a decrease in the frequency of sudden death, which
leads to the theory that these fatty acids could have anti-
arrhythmic properties(15). Nevertheless, the evolution of the
study on this topic has shed more controversy than light on

into debate, but

the issue. Although it seems, in the view of some observa-
tional and cohort studies, that omega-3 may have the effect
of lowering the appearance of atrial ﬁbrillation, especially in
the type linked to atrial remodelling associated with age(52)
(but not in the type associated with cardiac surgery)(54), the
impact of omega-3 in ventricular arrhythmias is much more
debatable. Both pro- and anti-arrhytmic effects of these fatty
acids have been reported(20,21,22,55) and, perhaps, both really
exist. From the different in vitro and in vivo studies, it has
been established that omega-3 shortens the action’s potential
duration and slows down impulse conduction(56,57). These
actions may reduce the appearance of a triggered activity
and subsequent ventricular ﬁbrillation to those usually present
in the recent post-infarct state, and, on the other hand, facili-
tate the appearance of re-entry induced ventricular ﬁbrillation,
such as those provoked by other clinical or anatomical
causes(33).

Regarding the safety of using omega-3, a recent work
revised the incidence of side effects. The only adverse effect
that reached statistical signiﬁcance were gastrointestinal side
effects (mainly nausea)(6), which occur more frequently at
4 g/d or higher doses, in up to 20 % of the patients (or 4 %
of the patients below 3 g/d)(58), which may be accompanied
by a ﬁshy taste when belching and may be minimized by
taking the supplements with meals or freezing the capsule(59).
The most severe potential adverse effect studied regarding
omega-3 is the potential risk of bleeding, by their effects on
platelet metabolism(60,61). However, studies which evaluated
the safety of using omega-3 up to 4 g/d in takers of anti-plate-
lets and anticoagulants, reported no increased risk on minor
or major bleeding events(62,63), which has been also conﬁrmed
in a recent meta-analysis(6). Another potential side effect of the
consumption of omega-3 from a dietary source (ﬁsh) is the
mercury intake that may be involved, especially in big ﬁshes
(blue ﬁn tuna, shark, tileﬁsh, swordﬁsh, or king mackerel).
Although mercury intake has been related to cardiovascular
disease,
this relationship is still not yet clearly proven,
especially in the amounts that can be derived from eating
the net health beneﬁts of overall ﬁsh
ﬁsh, and to date,
consumption in adults are clear
review,
please see(64)).

(for a recent

In vitro and animal studies suggest that PUFA are more
prone to become oxidized than other sources of fatty acids,
such as MUFA(65). Furthermore, it has been shown that diets
rich in omega-3 fatty acids cause an increased susceptibility
of lipids to oxidation(66). Nevertheless, other studies have
not found such results(68 – 70), and a recent study did not ﬁnd
any differences in the different markers of oxidative stress in
over 400 patients with metabolic syndrome who consumed
four dietary models for 12 weeks, one of which enriched in
1·24 g/d of long chain omega-3 fatty acids(71). In conclusion,
although omega-3 fatty acids have been shown to increase
the susceptibility to oxidation of circulating lipids, studies
have not proved that they are linked to an increase in markers
of oxidative stress. Further studies are needed to clarify this
question.

In conclusion, we have reviewed the effects of marine
omega-3 fatty acids on cardiovascular events from randomized

in supplements for at

controlled trials and clinical trials. The accumulated evidence,
as of January, 2012,
indicates that marine omega-3, when
administered as food or
least 6
months,
reduces cardiovascular events by 10 %, cardiac
death by 9 % and coronary events by 18 %, while showing a
trend for a lower total mortality (5 %, p ¼ 0·13). These results
are based in the evaluation of studies that included mainly
persons with high cardiovascular risk, and in studies which
are highly heterogenic in the dose administered, although
there is no evidence of dose-dependent protection. Our
results, along with the existing evidence on the myriad of
physiological effects of omega-3 on human health (coagu-
lation, heart rate, heart rhythm, blood lipids, etc), reinforce
the AHA recommendations for the intake of omega-3 in the
prevention of cardiovascular disease, especially in persons
with high cardiovascular risk and secondary prevention.

Abstract
Objective To clarify associations of fish consumption and long chain
omega 3 fatty acids with risk of cerebrovascular disease for primary and
secondary prevention.
Design Systematic review and meta-analysis.
Data sources Studies published before September 2012 identified
through electronic searches using Medline, Embase, BIOSIS, and
Science Citation Index databases.
Eligibility criteria Prospective cohort studies and randomised controlled
trials reporting on associations of fish consumption and long chain omega
3 fatty acids (based on dietary self report), omega 3 fatty acids
biomarkers, or supplementations with cerebrovascular disease (defined
as any fatal or non-fatal ischaemic stroke, haemorrhagic stroke,
cerebrovascular accident, or transient ischaemic attack). Both primary
and secondary prevention studies (comprising participants with or without
cardiovascular disease at baseline) were eligible.
Results 26 prospective cohort studies and 12 randomised controlled
trials with aggregate data on 794 000 non-overlapping people and 34
817 cerebrovascular outcomes were included. In cohort studies
comparing categories of fish intake the pooled relative risk for
cerebrovascular disease for 2-4 servings a week versus ≤1 servings a
week was 0.94 (95% confidence intervals 0.90 to 0.98) and for ≥5
servings a week versus 1 serving a week was 0.88 (0.81 to 0.96). The
relative risk for cerebrovascular disease comparing the top thirds of

baseline long chain omega 3 fatty acids with the bottom thirds for
circulating biomarkers was 1.04 (0.90 to 1.20) and for dietary exposures
was 0.90 (0.80 to 1.01). In the randomised controlled trials the relative
risk for cerebrovascular disease in the long chain omega 3 supplement
compared with the control group in primary prevention trials was 0.98
(0.89 to 1.08) and in secondary prevention trials was 1.17 (0.99 to 1.38).
For fish or omega 3 fatty acids the estimates for ischaemic and
haemorrhagic cerebrovascular events were broadly similar. Evidence
was lacking of heterogeneity and publication bias across studies or within
subgroups.
Conclusions Available observational data indicate moderate, inverse
associations of fish consumption and long chain omega 3 fatty acids
with cerebrovascular risk. Long chain omega 3 fatty acids measured as
circulating biomarkers in observational studies or supplements in primary
and secondary prevention trials were not associated with cerebrovascular
disease. The beneficial effect of fish intake on cerebrovascular risk is
likely to be mediated through the interplay of a wide range of nutrients
abundant in fish.
Introduction
Fish consumption is considered one of the key components of
a cardioprotective diet.1 Current cardiovascular guidelines2 3 for
healthy individuals encourage consumption of a variety of fish,
preferably oily types, at least twice a week. Cold water oily fish

and fish oil are also the most common dietary sources of long
chain omega 3 fatty acids, a group of polyunsaturated fats that
primarily include eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic
acid.4 Studies show that regular consumption of both these fats
as supplements may reduce arrhythmias, endothelial dysfunction,
circulating triglyceride levels, and inflammation.5 6 Such findings
have prompted clinical guidelines to recommend the use of
these nutrients in people with pre-existing coronary heart disease
or high blood levels of triglycerides.7 8 Whether, or to what
extent, current recommendations for consumption of fish or
long chain omega 3 fatty acids may apply to cerebrovascular
diseases is, however, unclear. Observational evidence on
consumption of fish and omega 3 fatty acid is inconsistent for
cerebrovascular outcomes.9 Likewise, despite a growing body
of experimental evidence on eicosapentaenoic acid and
docosahexaenoic acid supplements, the results for cardiovascular
prevention are conflicting. Whereas earlier trials reported
moderate protective effects on coronary heart disease and sudden
cardiac death outcomes,10 11 recent large scale primary and
secondary prevention trials failed to show the efficacy of
supplementation with long chain fatty acids in reducing
cardiovascular diseases.12 13 Therefore, whether supplementing
with long chain omega 3 fatty acids could specifically help
prevent stroke, remains elusive.
Several studies have investigated the intake of fish and long
chain omega 3 fatty acids in relation to cerebrovascular
disease.14-21 However, these studies varied in methodology (for
example, self reported dietary intake of omega 3 fatty acids
versus circulating biomarkers versus supplements), scientific
rigour (for example, sufficient power and duration of follow-up),
or the ability to evaluate associations in greater detail (for
example, by stroke subtypes). Furthermore, previous
meta-analyses22-24 dealing with these hypotheses did not assess
important differences in the exposure type, such as white versus
fatty fish consumption, within clinically relevant subgroups (for
example, average intake or stroke subtypes); and did not
systematically compare observational evidence in the context
of experimental data in a single investigation.
We systematically reviewed and meta-analysed available studies
to quantify the associations of fish consumption with total and
cause specific cerebrovascular disease in prospective cohort
studies; examined associations of dietary and circulating levels
of long chain omega 3 fatty acids with cerebrovascular diseases
in observational studies; and evaluated the potential effects of
their supplementations on future cerebrovascular events in
randomised controlled trials.
Methods
We carried out an electronic search using primarily Medline,
supplemented by searches of Embase, BIOSIS, and the Science
Citation Index databases, for studies published before September
2012, without any language restriction (see supplementary file
for details of the search strategy). Potentially eligible studies
were those that had reported associations of fish (defined as fish
and other seafood) or omega 3 fatty acids consumption,
circulating omega 3 fatty acids, and omega 3 fatty acid
supplements or dietary fish interventions with cerebrovascular
disease (defined as any fatal or non-fatal ischaemic stroke,
haemorrhagic stroke, cerebrovascular accident, or transient
ischaemic attack). In the computer based searches we combined
search terms related to the exposure (for example, fish, fatty
acids, omega 3 fatty acids) and outcomes of interest (stroke,
cerebrovascular disorders, etc). We considered prospective
cohort studies to be eligible for inclusion if they had at least

one year of follow-up and involved either general populations
(participants not selected on the basis of pre-existing disease)
or people at high risk of cardiovascular disease (those selected
on the basis of high risk factors for cardiovascular disease or
pre-existing cardiovascular disease, or both). Randomised
intervention studies were eligible for inclusion if they assessed
the effects of long chain omega 3 fatty acids supplements or
dietary fish consumption in adults; collected “hard”
cerebrovascular disease endpoints, such as fatal or non-fatal
ischaemic stroke, or fatal or non-fatal haemorrhagic stroke; and
followed participants for at least one year. Two independent
reviewers screened the titles, abstracts, and full texts of the
initially identified studies to determine eligibility. Disagreements
were resolved through consensus or consultation with a third
author. To identify additional publications we searched the
reference lists of all retrieved studies.
Data collection process and data items
Two independent reviewers used a predesigned data abstraction
form to extract relevant information from the selected studies.
The form included questions on study size, study design,
baseline population (general populations or those at high risk
of cardiovascular disease), geographical location, year of
baseline survey, age range of participants at baseline, duration
of follow-up, reported degree of adjustment for potential
confounders (defined as “+” when relative risks were adjusted
for age and sex, “++” after further adjustment for conventional
vascular risk factors (for example, smoking status, history of
diabetes, and hypertension), and “+++” when further adjusted
for other additional variables (for example, social class or total
energy intake), type and numbers of cerebrovascular disease
outcomes, and reported relative risks for each outcome. Where
appropriate we extracted information on type of fish (white or
fatty), amount consumed daily, dietary assessment tool (dietary
questionnaire, defined as food frequency or diet history
questionnaires; diet records, defined as all open ended
instruments such as 24 hour recall and food diaries), blinding
status, and type and composition of supplement or placebo. In
the case of multiple publications, we abstracted the most up to
date or most comprehensive information.
Quality evaluation assessment
Two independent investigators evaluated the quality of the
included studies by using a modified scoring system based on
MOOSE, QUATSO, and STROBE guidelines.25-27 This allowed
a total score from 0 to 6 points (6 representing the highest
quality), with 1 point allocated if a study provided a study
rationale; used appropriate selection criteria; employed a
validated questionnaire (dietary studies) or assay method (blood
based studies), or involved adequate blinding (randomised
controlled trials); collected outcomes not solely based on self
report; reported findings adjusted for age, sex, body mass index,
and smoking status; and additionally adjusted for other
covariates, such as social status and other nutrients.
Statistical analysis
To limit potential biases, the analyses involved only comparisons
within studies (participants being directly compared only within
each cohort). To enable a consistent approach to analyses, where
appropriate, we transformed risk estimates from each prospective
cohort study to enable comparisons between the top and bottom
third of the population’s baseline distribution of exposure values,
using methods previously described.28 Briefly, we transformed
log risk estimates assuming a normal distribution, with the

comparison between top and bottom thirds being equivalent to
2.18 times the log risk ratio for a 1 standard deviation increase
(or equivalently as 2.18/2.54 times the log risk ratio for a
comparison of extreme quarters). We calculated standard errors
of the log risk ratios using published confidence limits and then
standardised them in the same way. Hazard and odds ratios were
assumed to approximate the same measure of relative risks.
Using a random effects model that included between study
heterogeneity, we calculated summary relative risks by pooling
the study specific estimates. Where studies reported relative
risks with differing degrees of adjustment for other risk factors,
we used the maximum adjusted estimate. Dose-response
meta-analysis of fish consumption and cerebrovascular risk was
done using methods previously reported,24 29 which facilitated
the calculation of a pooled relative risk across studies with a
common unit of comparison within studies (the relative risk
associated with a two incremental serving a week in this review),
assuming a linear dose-response relation. Assessments for
standardised categories of fish consumption (2-4 times a week
and ≥5 times a week) and cerebrovascular risk compared with
a reference category (≤1 a week) were based on combining
comparable relative risk estimates across studies using random
effects meta-analyses.22 As reference groups of the included
studies varied (that is, from 0 to ≤1 times/week), in this analysis,
we defined “≤1/week” as the reference category assuming that
all reported reference exposures represent an equally low level
of intake. Consistency of findings across studies was assessed
by standard χ2 tests and the I2 statistic.30 Heterogeneity was
quantified by comparing results from studies grouped according
to prespecified study level characteristics using metaregression.
Evidence of publication bias was assessed using funnel plots
and the Egger test.31 All statistical tests were two sided and used
a significance level of P<0.05. Analyses were done using Stata
release 11.
Results
The search strategy identified 4343 unique citations. After the
initial screening, based on titles and abstracts, 447 articles
remained for further evaluation. Following detailed assessments,
402 articles were excluded (fig 1⇓). Overall, 45 articles based
on 38 unique studies met the inclusion criteria and were included
in the meta-analysis (see supplementary file). All relevant
studies identified were published in the English language. In
aggregate, the included studies comprised 794 000 unique
participants and 34 817 incident cerebrovascular disease
outcomes from 15 countries (table⇓ and supplementary tables).
Fish consumption and cerebrovascular risk
Information on fish consumption and cerebrovascular disease
were available in 21 prospective cohort studies, totalling 675
048 participants and 25 320 incident cerebrovascular events
(see supplementary table 1). All 21 studies were based on
general populations. Seven involved participants from Europe,
seven from North America, and seven from the Asia-Pacific
region. Six studies included only men, three only women, and
the rest both sexes. The relative risk of cerebrovascular disease
for standardised categories of fish intake, typically adjusted for
several conventional risk factors, for 2-4 versus ≤1 servings a
week was 0.94 (95% confidence interval 0.90 to 0.98) and for
≥5 versus ≤1 servings a week was 0.88 (0.81 to 0.96) (based
on 18 and eight studies, respectively; fig 2⇓ and supplementary
figs 1 and 2). There was no evidence of heterogeneity across
studies (I2=20-22%, P>0.05 for both, see supplementary figs 1
and 2). In the dose-response meta-analysis (18 studies), an

increment of two servings a week of any fish was associated
with a 4% (95% confidence interval 1% to 7%) reduced risk of
cerebrovascular disease (fig 2 and supplementary fig 3). For all
21 studies the relative risk when comparing participants in the
highest with the lowest category of fish intake was 0.88 (0.84
to 0.93, see supplementary fig 4). In a subset of studies (62 799
participants) the corresponding relative risk for white fish types
was 1.03 (0.90 to 1.19) and for fatty fish types was 0.84 (0.72
to 0.98, see supplementary fig 5).
Comparison with evidence from long chain
omega 3 fatty acid studies
Fourteen prospective studies reported on long chain omega 3
fatty acids in relation to risk of cerebrovascular disease,
involving 305 119 participants and 5374 cerebrovascular
outcomes recorded during an average follow-up ranging from
four to 30 years (see supplementary table 2). Ten studies
reported on intake of dietary long chain omega 3 fatty acid,
whereas four were based on circulating blood compositions of
omega 3. Five studies involved participants from Europe, four
from North America, and five from the Asia-Pacific region.
Seven studies concerned both sexes, five only men, and two
only women. All cohorts included healthy populations at
baseline. Fig 3⇓ and supplementary figs 6 and 7 present the
relative risks for cerebrovascular disease for participants in the
top compared with bottom third of baseline long chain omega
3 fatty acid and fish consumption. Relative risks for long chain
omega 3 fatty acids measured as circulating biomarkers and self
reported dietary exposures were 1.04 (95% confidence interval
0.90 to 1.20) and 0.90 (0.80 to 1.01), respectively. The
corresponding relative risk in the top compared with bottom
third of baseline fish consumption (11 studies; 366 787
participants) was 0.91 (0.86 to 0.97). Similar results were
obtained for ischaemic and haemorrhagic stroke events (fig 3
and supplementary figs 8 and 9).
Effects of long chain omega 3 fatty acid
supplements on cerebrovascular risk
Twelve randomised controlled trials totalling 62 040 participants
reported on long chain omega 3 fatty acids supplementation and
cerebrovascular disease (see supplementary table 3). No study
assessed the effects of any dietary fish interventions. Most of
these randomised controlled trials (nine out of 12) were done
in Europe. Ten trials included participants with previous
cardiovascular disease, whereas two concerned populations
without any pre-existing cardiovascular disease at baseline.
Participants in the intervention arm on average consumed 1.8
g of long chain omega 3 fatty acids daily (range 0.4-6.0 g/day),
where an oil capsule was the principle form of supplementation.
After an average follow-up of 3.0 (range 1.0-4.7 years) years,
a total of 800 cerebrovascular events occurred among
participants in the intervention group compared with 763 events
in the control group, with a pooled relative risk of 1.03 (95%
confidence interval 0.94 to 1.12; fig 4⇓). No evidence of
heterogeneity was found among these randomised controlled
trials (I2=3.5%, P=0.41, also see supplementary fig 10). The
corresponding pooled relative risk for primary prevention trials
(two studies) was 0.98 (0.89 to 1.08) and for secondary
prevention trials (10 studies) was 1.17 (0.99 to 1.38, fig 4 and
supplementary fig 10). The relative risks were broadly similar
across baseline population and for cause specific cerebrovascular
outcomes based on studies with available data (fig 4 and
supplementary fig 10).

Stratified and sensitivity analyses
The overall associations observed in prospective studies for
consumption of fish and long chain omega 3 fatty acids remained
broadly consistent when these studies were grouped by several
characteristics at study level. For instance, the overall relative
risk of cerebrovascular disease when comparing the highest
with the lowest category of fish intake was 0.87 (95%
confidence interval 0.82 to 0.92) and for studies with higher
and lower average fish consumption was 0.89 (0.78 to 1.01) (P
for heterogeneity >0.05; see supplementary fig 11). Similarly,
comparing studies with higher versus lower average
consumption of long chain omega 3 fatty acids yielded relative
risks of 0.93 (0.81 to 1.07) and 0.85 (0.72 to 1.01), respectively
(P for heterogeneity >0.05, also see supplementary fig 12a). For
consumption of both fish and omega 3 fatty acids in cohort
studies, the magnitude of the relative risks of cerebrovascular
disease for women seemed larger than those for men. In the
randomised controlled trials there was also no clear evidence
of heterogeneity according to several trial characteristics (for
example, amount and type of intervention, blinding status, trial
size, or duration of follow-up), except for some evidence that
larger studies tended to yield more extreme relative risks (see
supplementary fig 12b). In both observational and experimental
studies, subgroup analyses indicated no geographical variation
for the associations.
Analysis of publication bias
There was no evidence of publication bias across prospective
cohort studies of fish or long chain omega 3 fatty acid
consumption and the randomised controlled trials included in
this review (P>0.05 in Egger’s asymmetry test for all, also see
supplementary fig 13).
Discussion
This review found that higher fish consumption is moderately
but significantly associated with a reduced risk of incident
cerebrovascular disease. By contrast, dietary, circulating
biomarkers and supplements of long chain omega 3 fatty acids
were not significantly associated with risk of cerebrovascular
disease. The combined estimates remained similar for cause
specific cerebrovascular events. The associations for long chain
omega 3 fatty acids were consistent across people with and
without pre-existing cardiovascular disease—indicating a
potential lack of benefit for either primary or secondary
prevention of cerebrovascular disease. These findings therefore
suggest that single nutrients may have limited effects on chronic
disease outside of their original food sources.
The results observed in our review for fish consumption and
cerebrovascular risk may have several alternative explanations.
Firstly, it is possible that the potential benefit of fish
consumption could in addition to long chain omega 3 fatty acids
be attributed to a wider array of nutrients (and their interaction)
that are abundant in fish. For example, fish are also a good
source of vitamins D and B complex, which have been linked
to inverse cerebrovascular risk.32 33 In addition, essential amino
acids and trace elements in fish (for example, taurine,34 35
arginine,36 selenium,37 calcium,38 magnesium,39 40 potassium,41
and iodine42) may have potentially favourable vascular effects.
Secondly, the positive impact of fish could be explained by a
concomitant reduction in intake of foods detrimental to
cerebrovascular health, such as red meat. Adjustment for
confounding by other dietary factors is often inadequate and
rarely accounts for such “protein substitution effect.”43 None
the less, in a recent analysis based on two large cohorts in the

United States, a 17% reduction in cerebrovascular risk was
observed when red meat intake was replaced with fish.43 Thirdly,
higher fish consumption may simply be an indicator of a
healthier dietary pattern or higher socioeconomic status, which
themselves are associated with conventional vascular
determinants and outcomes.16 44 Although our subgroup analyses
by levels of adjustment were consistent with the overall
estimates, this may not fully address the potential issue of
residual confounding, as individual characteristics such as
baseline vascular drug use (antihypertensives, statins, aspirin,
etc) or level of adherence (for instance for omega 3 supplements
in randomised controlled trials) were generally unavailable in
the studies included in the meta-analysis. The differences
observed for the associations between white and fatty fish may
be explained by the distinct ways in which the two foods are
typically prepared. Studies that contributed to these analyses
were exclusively based on the United Kingdom,17 where dietary
questionnaires for the white fish items usually include battered
and deep fried white fish; and in Sweden, where frying is the
most common cooking method for white fish.15 This systematic
difference in the preparation of white fish, in contrast with that
of oily fish, could explain the null effect because potentially
detrimental fats (such as trans fatty acids) are added during the
cooking process.45
The discordant results observed for long chain omega 3 fatty
acids compared with overall fish intake may also have various
potential explanations. Firstly, food composition tables are often
incomplete such that the long chain omega 3 fatty acid content
of foods is unknown, which may lead to underestimation of the
true intake of long chain omega 3 fatty acids. For example, only
65% of all foods in the US Department of Agriculture food
composition database reportedly have a value for their omega
3 fatty acid content.46 Additionally, these databases may not
account for all variations in the omega 3 fatty acid content of
fish from different environments47 (for example, cooking
methods, dietary patterns, or farm raised food versus wild
sources).7 Secondly, self reported dietary questionnaires typically
seek information on fish group rather than on specific fish types
(for instance, oily fish versus salmon). Considering the
substantial differences in quantity of omega 3 fatty acids
between marine species,48 this inaccurate grouping of fish may
lead to potential poor allocation of nutrient composition to food
and overall misclassification of omega 3 fatty acid intake, which
may attenuate the associations. Thirdly, although fish intake
generally correlates highly with circulating blood omega 3 fatty
acid levels, in the general Western population only 20-25% of
the variation in such levels might be explained by fish
consumption alone.49 This may be responsible, at least in part,
for the inconsistent results between observational studies
concerning fish and long chain omega 3 fatty acids. Fourthly,
in our analyses circulating biomarkers of long chain omega 3
fatty acids were not associated with cerebrovascular disease.
Although blood fatty acid levels are not affected by limitations
in the dietary instruments or composition databases, these
biomarkers only reflect exposures over the previous few weeks
compared with a prolonged assessment that is more relevant to
predict chronic disease risk.50 Finally, none of the randomised
controlled trials were designed to investigate cerebrovascular
disease as the primary outcome of interest. Therefore, competing
risk events such as coronary heart disease may have altered the
probability of cerebrovascular outcomes and impeded many
subsequent events being considered thus limiting sufficiently
powerful analyses. Furthermore, discrepant findings on omega
3 fatty acids in observational studies and randomised controlled
trials may be partly explained by the inherent differences

between baseline populations in the two designs—that is,
generally healthy people compared with people with previous
vascular disease or higher cardiovascular disease risk factors,
respectively.
Comparison with previous studies
Findings of this updated meta-analysis generally concur and
further extend the findings of previous reviews in several
important ways. Our meta-analysis reinforces earlier results by
including several recently published large scale prospective
cohort studies. Our analyses on prospective dietary fish studies,
for example, involved twice as many cerebrovascular events as
the two previous reviews combined.22 24 Similarly, analyses on
long chain omega 3 fatty acids based on data from observational
studies and trials had about 10 times as many stroke events as
the previous analysis.23 The current review also evaluates the
potential effects of long chain omega 3 supplements on
cerebrovascular risk by comparing observational evidence in
the context of experimental data, systematically in a single
investigation. Additionally, it comprehensively records a wide
range of clinically relevant subgroups to carry out the most
detailed exploration of potential heterogeneity than previously
reported.
Implications of findings
Our findings may have several implications. They reinforce a
potentially modest beneficial role of fish intake in the cause of
cerebrovascular disease. Such an advantage was less evident
for long chain omega 3 fatty acids in both observational studies
and interventions targeting primary and secondary stroke
prevention. Our findings are in line with current dietary
guidelines (that is, to encourage fish consumption for all; and
intake of fish oils, preferably from oily fish, to people with
pre-existing or at high risk of coronary heart disease) and favour
propositions that the future nutritional guidelines should be
principally “food based.”51 They also underscore scientific gaps
in the experimental evidence, specifically the lack of studies
involving healthy populations and interventions targeting fish
intake rather than using supplements, which may have different
mechanistic effects. Additionally, adequately powered data from
trials will be essential to investigate reliably the apparent higher
risk of cerebrovascular disease observed in the secondary
prevention trials of long chain omega 3 fatty acid supplements,
and potential sex specific associations across observational
studies.
Strengths and limitations of this review
The strengths and limitations of this review merit consideration.
We included data from almost 800 000 participants from 15
countries. There was limited evidence of heterogeneity and
publication bias across studies or within subgroups. In the
absence of individual patient level data, we used standardised
risk estimates to allow consistent comparisons and we examined
several clinically relevant characteristics to reduce potential
heterogeneity. However, the current review was limited by an
overall lack of available data on the cause specific
cerebrovascular outcomes. For example, only a few studies
reported more than 1000 ischaemic stroke events, whereas most
involved analyses primarily on composite cerebrovascular
events. Furthermore, even in aggregate, fewer than 2000
cerebrovascular events were available in the randomised
controlled trials and none of them were based on healthy
populations.

Conclusions
Available observational data demonstrate moderate, inverse
associations of fish and long chain omega 3 fatty acids
consumption with risk of cerebrovascular events. However,
there was no evidence for similar inverse associations with
cerebrovascular disease for long chain omega 3 fatty acids
measured as circulating biomarkers in observational studies, or
supplements in primary and secondary prevention trials. The
beneficial effect of fish intake on cerebrovascular risk might be
mediated through a complex interplay among a wide range of
nutrients commonly found in fish.

What is already known on this topic

Consumption of fish and long chain omega 3 fatty acids has been associated with a reduced risk of coronary heart disease and sudden
cardiac death
However, observational and experimental evidence supporting a similar benefit for cerebrovascular disease remain conflicting

the risk of cerebrovascular diseases
However, currently available evidence from long chain omega 3 fatty acid supplementation trials, based on both primary and secondary
prevention studies, do not support the observational evidence
The beneficial effect of fish intake on cerebrovascular risk might be mediated through a complex interplay among a wide range of

Abstract
Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are growing contributors to global disease burdens,
with epidemics of CVD advancing across many regions of the world which are
experiencing a rapid health transition. Diet and nutrition have been extensively
investigated as risk factors for major cardiovascular diseases like coronary heart
disease (CHD) and stroke and are also linked to other cardiovascular risk factors like
diabetes, high blood pressure and obesity. The interpretation of evidence needs to
involve a critical appraisal of methodological
issues related to measurement of
exposures, nature of outcome variables,
types of research design and careful
separation of cause, consequence and confounding as the basis for observed
associations.
from studies conducted within and across
Adequate evidence is available,
populations, to link several nutrients, minerals, food groups and dietary patterns
with an increased or decreased risk of CVD. Dietary fats associated with an increased
risk of CHD include trans-fats and saturated fats, while polyunsaturated fats are
known to be protective. Dietary sodium is associated with elevation of blood
pressure, while dietary potassium lowers the risk of hypertension and stroke. Regular
frequent intake of fruits and vegetables is protective against hypertension, CHD and
stroke. Composite diets (such as DASH diets, Mediterranean diet, ‘prudent’ diet) have
been demonstrated to reduce the risk of hypertension and CHD. Sufﬁcient
knowledge exists to recommend nutritional interventions, at both population and
individual levels, to reduce cardiovascular risk. That knowledge should now be
translated into policies which promote healthy diets and discourage unhealthy diets.
This requires coordinated action at
international
organizations, civil society and responsible sections of the food industry.

The second half of the 20th century witnessed major health
transitions in the world, propelled by socio-economic and
technological changes that profoundly altered life expect-
ancy and ways of living, while creating an unprecedented
human capacity to use science to prolong and enhance
life. The most globally pervasive change among these
health transitions has been the rising burden of non-
communicable diseases (NCDs). Epidemics of NCDs are
presently emerging, or accelerating, in most developing
countries1. Cardiovascular diseases (CVD), cancers,
diabetes, neuropsychiatric ailments and other chronic
diseases are becoming major contributors to the burden of
disease, even as infections and nutritional deﬁciencies are
receding as leading contributors to death and disability.

Global dimensions of the CVD epidemic

CVD is a major contributor to the global burden of disease
among the NCDs. Coronary heart disease (CHD) is likely

to be the most common cause of DALY loss in 2020 as
compared with its ﬁfth position in 1991. The World Health
Organization attributes 30% of all global deaths (i.e. 15.3
million) as well as 10.3% of the total DALYs lost in 1998 to
CVD2. The low- and middle-income countries, because of
their much larger population, accounted for 78% of all
deaths and 86.3% of DALYs lost—attributable to CVD—
world-wide in 1998.

According to the Global Burden of Disease Study, a 55%
rise would occur in DALY loss attributable to CVD
between 1990 and 2020 in the developing countries3. This
would be in contrast
to a 14.3% reduction in the
proportion of DALY loss attributable to CVD during
the same period in the developed countries. Thus, the
increasing burden of CVD would be borne mostly by the
developing countries in the next two decades (Fig. 1).

The global burden of CVD affects all sections of the
society. Cardiovascular deaths in 1998 contributed to 34%
of global mortality in women and 28.2% of all deaths in

men2. Such a scenario also exists within the developing
countries, where women are increasingly affected by
hypertension, stroke and CHD. In developing countries,
where epidemiological transition has advanced, there is
evidence of a progressive reversal of the social gradient,
with the poor becoming the most vulnerable victims4. This
parallels the pattern of the cardiovascular epidemics in the
developed countries. Risk behaviours, risk factors and
disease burdens in the developed countries were initially
higher in the ‘early adopters’ (the higher social classes).
However, these factors later become a mass phenomenon
as the mediators of risk were abundantly produced for
mass consumption and ultimately imposed the highest
burdens of disease on the ‘late adopters’ (lower social
classes), as the early adopters reduced their risk in
response to new knowledge and new technologies.
Evidence of such a reversal of social gradient is available
from recent studies in several developing countries5,6.

In addition to the increasing incidence of CVD, the early
age at which it manifests in these populations is also
contributing to the high CVD burden. Thus in 1990, 46.7%
of CVD-related deaths in developing countries occurred
below the age of 70 years, in contrast to only 22.8% in the
high-income industrial countries4. The Global Burden of
Disease Study projected that 6.4 million deaths would
occur due to CVD in the developing countries in 2020, in
the age group of 30– 69 years3.

Diet and CVD: methodological issues in the study of
causal associations

Issues related to study design
Studies investigating the inﬂuence of diet on CVD or
cardiovascular risk factors have employed a wide variety
of study designs—ecological studies within and across
populations, cross-sectional surveys, case– control studies
(de novo or nested), cohort studies, community based
demonstration projects randomised clinical
trials and
before – after type of metabolic studies. These differ widely

in terms of their ability to (a) identify, avoid and adjust for
confounding, (b) establish a temporal relationship of
cause preceding the effect, (c) minimise bias, (d) provide a
wide range of exposure, (e) ascertain composite end-
points, including fatal outcomes, (f) evaluate population
attributable risk and (g) yield generalisable results.

they do confer

While ecological studies are highly vulnerable to the
effects of multiple confounders,
the
advantage of enabling comparisons of populations across
time and habitat. Cross-sectional surveys and case – control
studies are mostly unsuited to study the temporal
sequence and usually suffer from a ‘survival bias’ resulting
from an inability to study fatal outcomes. They do,
however, offer an early opportunity to examine associ-
ations and identify potential avenues for intervention
related research. Observational cohort studies have the
advantage of being able to evaluate long-term effects of
dietary exposures and often provide a wide range of
exposure, but are vulnerable to unknown confounders
which cannot be adjusted for as well as possible
measurement errors in dietary ascertainment. Effects of
changes in dietary exposures occurring during the long
period of observation are also difﬁcult
to evaluate.
Demonstration projects provide a population laboratory
to evaluate dietary interventions in real life settings but
face methodological challenges from limited sample size,
contamination and confounding. Clinical trials,
if well
designed, provide the best
framework for studying
associations, as free from the effects of bias and
confounding as possible. However, they often evaluate
interventions which are relatively short-term and intro-
duced late in the natural history of disease and may not
replicate the effects of
long-term dietary exposures.
Genetics now offers a possible alternative to clinical trials
through ‘Mendelian randomisation’. This approach takes
into account that genotypic differences in the metabolism
of food ingredients may cause lifelong differences in
exposure to food components and their metabolites or to
purported risk factors. It is a powerful way to establish
causality without the need for prolonged follow-up7.

These issues related to study design become relevant
when interpreting the results of reported studies on diet
and CVD and assessing their public health implications.
Frequently, conclusions from studies employing weak
designs are negated by the results emerging from
methodologically stronger studies. Public policy and
clinical practice must both be judiciously guided by
credible evidence provided by scientiﬁcally stronger
studies and not be misled by controversial
results
emerging from feeble study designs.

A related issue is the use of experimental animals.
Although these are often referred to as ‘animal models’ their
validity in predicting outcomes in humans is unclear. Lipid
metabolism especially is species-speciﬁc, as exempliﬁed
by the inefﬁcacy of cholesterol-lowering statin drugs in
many animal species including monkeys8. Experiments in

Diet, nutrition and prevention of hypertension and CVD

animals are,
therefore, best reserved for elucidating
mechanisms, and cannot be used to argue that a particular
food will have a particular effect on CVD in humans.

Issues involving outcome variables
Ideally, disease related endpoints are preferable since they
clearly demonstrate the beneﬁts or
risks of dietary
exposures. In an exposure such as diet, effects may
extend beyond cardiovascular outcomes. The need to
evaluate impact of diet on total mortality and major co-
morbidities, therefore, becomes an imperative. It must also
be recognised that dietary exposures which inﬂuence
thrombotic pathways may have different effects on the risk
of haemorrhagic stroke and thrombotic stroke, often in
opposite directions. The need to differentiate the types of
stroke in outcome evaluation is, therefore, clear and has
important implications for populations, which differ in
their stroke proﬁles. Similarly, selective beneﬁts limited
only to non-fatal outcomes, as in the case of CHAOS study
which reported a beneﬁt of vitamin E administration on
non-fatal myocardial infarction9, strain scientiﬁc credulity,
are seldom replicated and cannot inﬂuence either public
health policy or clinical practice.

The ascertainment of disease related endpoints, as the
primary outcome, has most often been attempted in large
and long-term cohort studies, or in clinical trials conducted
in population groups in whom high event rates were
anticipated in a short or medium time frame. Thus,
observational cohort studies investigating the long-term
impact of diet on primary prevention of CVD frequently
compete with secondary prevention trials. If the results are
discordant,
the
differences are due to methodological
reasons of
confounding or due to the fact that exposures occurred
at different times and for variable periods in the natural
history of the disease. It must, however, be recognised that
pathological processes such as endothelial dysfunction,
plaque instability, thrombosis and cardiac arrhythmias can
be inﬂuenced even by short-term exposures.

to interpret whether

it

is difﬁcult

Intermediate variables have been frequently utilised in
studies evaluating the association of dietary constituents or
dietary patterns to CVD. Most often, these are risk factors
like blood pressure or plasma lipids. While the effects of
diet on blood pressure constitute an acceptable basis for
estimating potential
impact on future cardiovascular
events10, such an extrapolation may not be equally valid
in the case of a variable like total plasma cholesterol.
Similar changes in total plasma cholesterol may be
associated with variable effects on levels of LDL and
HDL cholesterol and on the ratio of
to HDL
cholesterol. The impact on risk of atherosclerotic CVD
may thus vary. The 25-year follow-up experience of the
Seven Countries Study revealed that while the increase
in relative risk of CHD for comparable levels of plasma
cholesterol elevation was
similar across diverse
populations, the absolute risk of CHD varied widely at

total

169

the same level of plasma cholesterol, possibly due to other
dietary inﬂuences11. Even the effect on LDL cholesterol
level may not sufﬁce to conﬁdently project the down-
stream impact on CVD. Dietary changes may inﬂuence
LDL particle size differentially, as also the level of plasma
triglycerides, with variable net effects on the atherogeni-
city of the plasma lipid pool. Simple extrapolations to
beneﬁts on coronary artery disease may not be possible in
the complex area of diet related plasma and tissue lipid
changes. Plasma lipids, as intermediate variables, could
not also explain the degree of cardiovascular protection
conferred by the Mediterranean diet in the Lyon Diet Heart
Study14. While studies of intermediate variables are useful
in identifying mechanistic pathways of dietary harm or
beneﬁt and plasma cholesterol has served well so far to
explain much of the coronary risk associated with certain
diets, there is a need for methodologically strong studies
which relate dietary patterns or dietary interventions to
hard end points such as total mortality, cardiovascular
mortality and combined fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular
events.

Issues involving the exposure variables
The types of dietary exposure assessed for associations
with CVD, have varied from speciﬁc nutrients (such as
saturated fat) to dietary items (such as ﬁsh) to food groups
(such as fruits and vegetables) to dietary patterns (such as
‘Mediterranean’ diet or ‘Adventist’ diet) and composite
dietary interventions (e.g. the DASH diet). The scientiﬁc
method often emphasises a reductionist approach to
investigations of causality. Such an approach has inherent
limitations
in the area of diet, because multiple
interactions among many nutrients are likely to determine
the physiological effects and pathological outcomes much
more than the individual effects of an isolated nutrient.
The failure of anti-oxidants, when administered as pills, to
favourably inﬂuence cardiovascular outcomes in clinical
trials does not negate a protective role for their primary
food sources, as suggested by ecological and observa-
tional studies. On the other hand, identiﬁcation of active
components is often the way to extrapolate from one
particular study and population to another, since the
deﬁnition and pattern of ‘vegetable’ intake may vary from
one country to another.

The strengths and limitations of various methods of
collecting accurate food consumption data are well
recognised12. Questionnaire methods of ascertaining
information related to habitual food intake pose problems
of validity and reproducibility even within well deﬁned
populations but these problems are likely to be magniﬁed
when such instruments are applied across different
cultures. Even if the nutrient composition of self-reported
diets is accurately estimated, different cooking methods
may alter the ﬁnal bioavailability of those nutrients as
actually consumed. The need for valid and reproducible
biomarkers is,
important when studies of

therefore,

170

speciﬁc nutrients are proposed. For example, adipose
tissue fatty acid composition is a suitable biomarker for
habitual type of dietary fat intake13. There may, however,
be technical and ﬁnancial constraints which limit the use
of such biomarkers in large epidemiological studies.

A casual enquiry needs to recognise the lag time effect,
wherein a long period of exposure to dietary variables is
required before effect is evident on outcome variables
(especially disease related end points of atherosclerotic
vascular disorders). Short-term studies may be incapable
of identifying true effects even when they exist. This is
clearly illustrated by trials evaluating the effect of sodium
restriction on blood pressure, where beneﬁt was demon-
strated only in trials in which the duration of exposure was
at least 5 weeks14. The dose of exposure is another critical
variable in an area like diet, where many of the nutrients
are physiological requirements at a certain level but may
pose risk of cardiovascular dysfunction and disease at
other levels. The relationships may vary from linear to
J-shaped or threshold, for different variables. Ascertain-
ment of dose-related effects is essential, whether the
exposure is salt, alcohol or ﬁsh.

Issues related to diet as an independent variable
Unhealthy dietary behaviours often occur in association
with other unhealthy behaviours such as physical
inactivity and smoking. Furthermore, unhealthy dietary
practices such as high consumption of saturated fats, salt
and reﬁned carbohydrates as well as low consumption of
fruit and vegetables tend to cluster together. In contrast,
persons who habitually adopt one healthy dietary practice
are more likely to adopt other healthy dietary habits as
well as practice regular physical activity and abstinence
from smoking. Dietary behaviours may also reﬂect
patterns inﬂuenced by social class and may be inﬂuenced
by stress levels. Dissociating the speciﬁc effects of
individual dietary components from other dietary com-
ponents, physical activity levels and other behaviours
becomes difﬁcult outside the setting of a carefully
controlled clinical
the
question arises whether some dietary practices are merely
a surrogate for other dietary practices or for a composite of
multiple health behaviours. Whether diet should be
considered in dissociation from physical activity or should
preferably be studied in combination is also an issue for
observational research.

In observational studies,

trial.

The effects of diet on multiple cardiovascular risk
factors, ranging from body weight to blood lipids and
blood pressure to thrombotic mechanisms, also poses the
question of when and how far to adjust for these variables
in evaluating the relationship of diet to CVD. Since many of
these are intermediate variables linking diet
to CVD,
adjustment to exclude their effect would underestimate the
effect of diet. However, such variables are also inﬂuenced
by factors other than diet. In such cases, the decisions
related to adjustment should be carefully considered.

Nutrients and CVD

Dietary fats
The relationship between dietary fats and CVD, especially
CHD has been extensively investigated, with strong and
consistent associations emerging from a wide body of
evidence accrued from animal experiments, as well as
observational studies, clinical trials and metabolic studies
conducted in diverse human populations. This relation-
ship was initially considered to be mediated mainly
through the atherogenic effects of plasma lipids (total
cholesterol, lipoprotein fractions and triglycerides). The
effects of dietary fats on thrombosis and endothelial
function as well as the relationship of plasma and tissue
lipids to the pathways of inﬂammation have been more
recently understood13. Similarly, the effects of dietary fats
on blood pressure have also become more evident
through observational and experimental research.

The association of plasma total cholesterol and its low-
density lipoprotein sub fraction (LDL cholesterol) has
been consistently demonstrated across several popu-
lations, with the Seven Countries Study offering strong
evidence through within-population cohort experience
and inter-population ecological comparisons14. The
protective association of high-density lipoprotein (HDL)
fraction of plasma cholesterol has also been well identiﬁed
and the ratio of total to HDL cholesterol has emerged as a
strong predictor of the risk of CHD. Plasma triglycerides
too have been directly associated with the risk of
atherosclerotic vascular disease and thrombotic events.
The effect of various dietary fats on these plasma lipids has
constituted the key link in the causal pathway that
connects diet to CVD15.

Cholesterol in the blood and tissues is derived from two
sources: diet and endogenous synthesis. Dairy fat and
meat are major sources. Egg yolk is particularly rich in
cholesterol but unlike dairy and meat does not provide
saturated fatty acids (SFAs). Dietary cholesterol raises
plasma cholesterol levels16. Although both HDL and LDL
increase,
the effect on the total/HDL ratio is still
unfavourable17, but small. Observational evidence on an
association of dietary cholesterol
intake with CVD is
contradictory10,11. The upper limit for dietary cholesterol
intake has been prescribed,
in most guidelines, to be
300 mg/d. However, there is no requirement for dietary
cholesterol and it is advisable to keep the intake as low as
possible. If intake of dairy fat and meat are controlled then
there needs to be no severe restriction of egg yolk intake,
although some limitation remains prudent.

Fatty acids are grouped into three classes—SFAs,
monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) and polyunsatu-
rated fatty acids (PUFAs). While such a classiﬁcation is
useful
tends to
oversimplify the effects of dietary fats. Individual fatty
acids, within each group, are now known to have differing
effects on lipids,
lipoproteins and platelet-vascular

homeostasis. SFA and MUFA can be synthesised in the
body and hence are not dietary essentials. PUFA can be
subdivided into n-6 and n-3 PUFA, derived from linoleic
acid (LA) and a-linolenic acid (ALNA), respectively. These
are essential fatty acids, since they cannot be synthesised
in the body18,19.

171

to HDL cholesterol

ratio but

Saturated fatty acids
SFAs as a group raise total and LDL cholesterol, but
individual SFAs have different effects. Myristic and lauric
acids have greater effect than palmitic acid, but the latter is
more abundant in food supply. The plasma cholesterol
raising effects of
these three SFAs is higher when
combined with high cholesterol diets. Stearic acid has
not been shown to elevate blood cholesterol and is rapidly
converted to oleic acid (OA) in vivo. Metabolic (feeding)
studies demonstrate a marked elevation of both HDL and
LDL cholesterol induced by SFA diets18 – 20. Replacement of
saturated fatty acids by polyunsaturated fat reduces the
total
replacement by
carbohydrates does not. Also, tropical fats rich in lauric
acid (C12) raise total cholesterol strongly, but because of
their speciﬁc effect on HDL, the ratio of total to HDL
cholesterol falls. Thus, effects on blood lipids can be
variable, depending on which blood lipids are studied,
and we need data on actual outcomes to determine the
true effects of fats on CHD. The relationship of dietary
saturated fat to plasma cholesterol levels and to CHD was
graphically demonstrated by the Seven Countries Study
involving 16 cohorts,
intake
explained 73% of the total variance in CHD across these
cohorts14. In the Nurses Health Study19,
the effect of
saturated fatty acids was much more modest, especially if
saturates were replaced by carbohydrates. The most
effective replacement for saturated fatty acids in terms of
CHD outcome is by PUFAs, i.e. LA. This agrees with the
outcome of large randomised clinical
in which
replacement of saturated and trans fats by polyunsatu-
rated vegetable oils effectively lowered CHD risk20 – 22.

trials,

Trans-fatty acids (t-FAs)
t-FAs are geometrical isomers of unsaturated fatty acids
that assume a saturated fatty acid-like conﬁguration.
Partial hydrogenation, the process used to create t-FA, also
removes essential
fatty acids such as LA and ALNA.
Metabolic studies have demonstrated that t-FAs render the
plasma lipid proﬁle even more atherogenic than SFA, by
not only elevating LDL cholesterol to similar levels but also
decreasing HDL cholesterol23,24. As a result, the ratio of
LDL cholesterol to HDL cholesterol is signiﬁcantly higher
with a t-FA diet (2.58) than with a SFA diet (2.34) or an OA
diet (2.02). This greatly enhances the risk of CHD (Fig. 2).
Evidence that intake of t-FA increases the risk of CHD
initially became available from large population based
cohort studies in US25,26 and has recently been corrobo-
rated in an elderly Dutch population27. Levels of t-FA in a

rates by other fats: Nurses Health Study19

biochemical analysis of replicated baseline food compo-
sites correlated with the risk of coronary death in the
cohorts of the Seven Countries Study. Most
t-FAs are
contributed by industrially hardened oils, but the dairy and
meat fats of ruminants are also a source. Whether these
two sources have the same effect on CHD risk is unclear,
but reductions in ruminant fats are already advisable for
other reasons. Eliminating t-FAs from the diet would be an
important public health strategy to prevent CVD. Since
these are commercially introduced agents into the diet,
policy measures related to the food industry would be
required along with public education. t-FAs have been
eliminated from retail fats and spreads in a large part of the
world, but deep-fat fried fast foods and baked goods are a
major and increasing source28.

Monounsaturated fatty acids
The only nutritionally important MUFA is OA, which is
abundant in olive and canola oils and also in nuts. The
epidemiological evidence related to MUFA and CHD is
derived from studies on the Mediterranean diet, as well as
from the Nurses Health Study and other similar studies,
which investigated the association and control of
confounding factors29. MUFAs have been shown to
lower blood glucose and triglycerides in type II diabetics
and may decrease susceptibility of LDL to oxidative
modiﬁcation.

Polyunsaturated fatty acids
PUFAs are derived from Dietary LA (n-6 PUFAs) and
dietary ALNA (n-3 PUFAs). The important n-6 PUFAs are
arachidonic acid (AA) and dihomogammalinolenic acid
(DHGLA), while the important n-3 PUFAs are eicosapen-
taenoic acid (EPA) and docasahexaenoic acid (DHA).
Eicasanoids derived from AA have opposing metabolic
properties to those derived from DHA. A balanced intake
of n-6 and n-3 PUFAs is, therefore, essential for health.

The biological effects of n-3 PUFAs are wide ranging
involving lipids and lipoproteins, blood pressure, cardiac
function, arterial compliance, endothelial function, vas-
cular reactivity and cardiac electrophysiology as well as
potent anti-platelet and anti-inﬂammatory effects includ-
ing reduced neutrophil and monocyte cytokine pro-
duction13,30. Recent data have also shown that EPA and
DHA have differential effects on many of these. DHA

in
comparison to EPA, while a mixture of DHA and EPA
signiﬁcantly reduced platelet aggregation in comparison
to ALNA in vitro13,31. The very-long chain n-3 PUFAs
powerfully lower serum triglycerides, but they raise LDL
cholesterol32. Therefore, their effect on CHD is probably
mediated through pathways other than cholesterol.

Much of the epidemiological evidence related to n-3
PUFAs is derived from the study of ﬁsh consumption in
populations or
interventions involving ﬁsh diets in
clinical trials. Fish oils were, however, used in the GISSI
study of 11,300 survivors of myocardial infarction33. In
this factorial design, ﬁsh oil
(1 g/d) and vitamin E
(300 mg/d) were compared, alone and in combination, to
placebo. After 3.5 years of follow-up, the ﬁsh oil group
had a statistically signiﬁcant 20% reduction in total
mortality, 30% reduction in cardiovascular death and 45%
decrease in sudden death. While most published studies
do not indicate that dietary n-3 PUFA prevent restenosis
after percutaneous coronary angioplasty or
induce
regression of coronary atherosclerosis, one study
reported that occlusion of aortocoronary venous bypass
grafts was reduced after 1 year by daily ingestion of 4 g
ﬁsh oil concentrate34.

The Lyon Heart Study incorporated an n-3 fatty acid
(ALNA) into a diet altered to develop a ‘Mediterranean
intervention9. In the experimental group, plasma
diet’
ALNA and EPA increased signiﬁcantly and the trial
reported a 70% reduction in cardiovascular mortality at
5 years in its initial report. Total and LDL cholesterol were
identical
in the experimental and control groups,
suggesting that thrombotic and perhaps arrhythmic events
may have been favourably inﬂuenced by n-3 PUFA. Since
the diet altered many other variables, such as ﬁbre and
anti-oxidants (by increasing fruit and vegetable consump-
tion), direct attribution of beneﬁts to n-3 PUFA becomes
difﬁcult to establish.

The effect of different fatty acids on cardiac arrhythmias
has been an area of great interest. Diets rich in saturated
fatty acids increase the risk of ventricular ﬁbrillation and
sudden cardiac death in primates. A recent population
based case – control study, using biomarkers, revealed a
modest association of
t-FAs in general and a strong
association of trans isomers of LA in particular, with
primary cardiac arrest in humans35. Several studies in
different animal models, primate and rodent, have shown
that n-3 PUFA are protective against cardiac arrhythmias,
especially ventricular ﬁbrillation36. It has been suggested
that the fall in CHD mortality in USA and Australia, since
1967,
is probably attributable to an increase in poly-
unsaturated fat consumption in both countries since
196037. The decline in CHD mortality in the Zutphen
cohort has similarly been attributed to a decreased
consumption, over time, of t-FAs27.

KS Reddy and MB Katan

The proportions of SFA, MUFA and PFA as constituents
of total fat intake and total energy consumption have
engaged active attention, in view of the strong relationship
of these fatty acids to the risk of CVD, especially CHD. The
reduction of SFA in the diet has been widely rec-
ommended, but its replacement remains an area of debate
as to whether the place of reduced SFAs should be taken
by MUFA, PUFA or carbohydrate. Both MUFA and PUFA
improve the lipoproteins proﬁle, although PUFAs are
somewhat more effective. In view of this, recent US dietary
recommendations, suggested that SFA should be reduced
to 7 – 8%, MUFA should be increased to 13– 15% and PUFA
raised to 7 – 10% of daily energy, with the total
fat
contributing to no more than 30% of all calories
consumed29,38. These may need to be adjusted for
populations who consume less quantities of total fat, so
as to ensure an adequate intake of MUFA and PUFA even
under those circumstances.

The total quantity of fat consumed, as a proportion of
daily energy intake, has not shown a relation to CVD that is
independent of the SFA content. It has now generally been
agreed that the type of fats consumed in diet is more
important than the total amount of fat consumed39. The
compatibility of high-fat Mediterranean diets (with total fat
contributing . 30% of calories) with coronary protection
has been cited as supportive evidence. While the emphasis
on the type of fat is well placed, it must be recognised that
high-fat diets are also high in energy. Whether this
contributes substantially to overweight
is a subject of
much debate40. While the emphasis in dietary recommen-
dations should be on using the healthier fats in preference
to unhealthier fats, the total fat may be restricted to , 30%
of all energy in most populations and individuals.
However, individuals who regularly undertake vigorous
physical activity may consume higher levels of fat in their
daily diets (up to 35%).

Enhancing the nutritional quality of dietary fat
consumption, to provide greater cardiovascular protec-
tion, may be attempted by decreasing the sources of
saturated fats and eliminating t-FAs in the diet, increasing
the consumption of foods containing unsaturated fatty
acids (both MUFA and PUFA) and decreasing dietary
cholesterol consumption. Modiﬁcation of cooking oils
either through appropriate admixture of different oils41 or
through genetic modiﬁcation of oilseed crops42 may
provide methods for improving the quality of dietary fat
consumed through edible oils.

Carbohydrates
The relationship of dietary carbohydrates to CVD appears
to be mediated through indirect mechanisms: contribution
to total energy and its effect on overweight and obesity;
inﬂuence on central obesity; effects on plasma lipids,
especially triglycerides and effects on glycaemic control.
The balance between carbohydrates and fat as sources of
energy as well as the ﬁbre component of the diet are also

Diet, nutrition and prevention of hypertension and CVD

areas of interest while considering this relationship. In
feeding experiments, an increase in dietary energy from
carbohydrates is usually associated with a moderate
increase in fasting plasma triglyceride levels in the ﬁrst few
weeks but these return to near original levels in the ﬁrst
few weeks. Epidemiologically, high-carbohydrate intakes
are associated with low plasma cholesterol and variable
plasma triglyceride concentrations43.

The effect of a high-carbohydrate diet on HDL
cholesterol and thereby on the total to HDL cholesterol
ratio as well as on the particle size of LDL are matters of
interest while considering the inﬂuence on vascular
function and risk of CVD. High-carbohydrate diets appear
to reduce HDL cholesterol levels and increase the fraction
of small dense LDL, both of which may impact adversely
on vascular disease. This dyslipidemic pattern is consistent
with the elevation of plasma triglycerides. There is as yet
no clear evidence that
the risk of CVD is altered
independently by the carbohydrate levels in the diet.
The glycaemic index of foods might also be a determinant
of the extent to which carbohydrates can inﬂuence the
glycaemic status. Carbohydrate diets with high-glycaemic
index might adversely impact on glucose control, with
associated changes in plasma lipids44,45.

Dietary ﬁbre
Dietary ﬁbre is a heterogenous mixture of polysacchar-
ides and lignin that cannot be degraded by the
endogenous enzymes of vertebrate animals46. Water-
soluble ﬁbres include pectins, gums, mucilages and some
hemicelluloses. Insoluble ﬁbres include cellulose and
other hemicelluloses. Most soluble ﬁbres reduce plasma
total and LDL cholesterol concentrations, as reported by
several trials47. Pectins, psyllium, gums, mucilages, algal
polysaccharides and some hemicelluloses lower total and
LDL cholesterol levels without affecting HDL cholesterol,
the reductions in total cholesterol being usually in the
range of 5 – 10%. Human experiments have clearly shown
that oat ﬁbre tends to lower plasma total and LDL
cholesterol but wheat ﬁbre does not. Rice bran and
barley may also lower cholesterol48. Fibre consumption
predicted insulin levels, weight gain and cardiovascular
risk factors like blood pressure, plasma triglycerides, LDL
and HDL cholesterol and ﬁbrinogen more strongly than
other dietary components in the CARDIA cohort study of
young adults49. However, ﬁbre intake may be con-
founded with many other determinants of cardiovascular
health.

Between 1996 and 2001, ﬁve very large cohort studies in
the USA, Finland and Norway have all reported that
subjects consuming relatively large amounts of whole
grain cereals have signiﬁcantly lower rates of CHD48,50.
High intake of ﬁbre from cereal sources was associated
with a reduced risk of CHD in the Nurses Health Study50
and was inversely associated with the risk of hypertension
in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study51. Available

173

evidence supports a recommendation for consumption of
about 15 g/1000 kcal of ﬁbre47. Since some of the reported
beneﬁts may have risen from other dietary components
occurring in association with ﬁbre in natural foods, dietary
consumption of high-ﬁbre rather than isolated ﬁbre foods
should be recommended. Addition of wheat or cereal bran
may be considered, where necessary,
to supplement
natural foods in order to attain the recommended dietary
intake.

Anti-oxidants
The oxidation of LDL by oxygen free radicals results in the
unregulated uptake of modiﬁed LDL by macrophages in
arterial walls, accelerating the atherosclerotic process.
Anti-oxidant nutrients, which can directly scavenge free
include a-tocopherol (vitamin E isomer) and
radicals,
ascorbic acid (vitamin C), which have shown anti-oxidant
activity both in vitro and in vivo, as well as b-carotene
(a provitamin A carotenoid) which has displayed anti-
oxidant activity in vitro52. These mechanisms suggested
that increased dietary intake or supplementation of these
nutrients would be protective against atheroslerotic
vascular disorders. This was supported by evidence from
observational studies for vitamin E and b-carotene, but
results of clinical trials employing supplements have been
disappointing.

Observational cohort data suggest a protective role for
carotenoids. In a meta-analysis, the pooled relative risk
reduction for cardiovascular death, in those who ate diets
rich in b-carotene, was 31% (95% CI: 41– 20%), when
dietary and blood carotene levels were measured to
compare high and low consumers. The randomised trials,
in contrast,
reported a moderate adverse effect of
b-carotene supplementation, with a relative increase in
the risk of cardiovascular death of 12% in a meta-analysis
of four trials53. Cancer risk was also increased.

Several

studies

large cohort

showed signiﬁcant
reductions in the incidence of cardiac events in men and
women taking high-dose vitamin E supplements52.
However, The HOPE trial, a deﬁnitive clinical trial relating
vitamin E supplementation to cardiovascular outcomes,
revealed no effect of vitamin E supplementation (at
400 IU/d, for a mean follow-up of 4.5 years) on MI, stroke
or death from cardiovascular causes in men or women54.
Other trials too failed to demonstrate a cardioprotective
effect of vitamin E supplements55.

The conﬂict between diet based observational studies
trials employing supplements may arise
and clinical
because of one or more explanatory factors: confounding,
interactions/synergistic activity (among anti-oxidants; with
other nutrients), isomers with differing activity in food
compared to supplements, other associated protective
elements in natural foods (e.g. ﬂavonoids, phytoestro-
gens) and/or temporal dissociation of anti-oxidant blood
levels from fat intake in meals, when administered as once
a day pills. While the failure of pill supplementation does

174

not necessarily exclude protective effects of dietary anti-
oxidants, current evidence does not support supplemen-
tation of any of these anti-oxidant vitamins for prevention
of CHD. However, intake of their primary food resources,
especially fruit and vegetables, may be encouraged.

Folate
The relationship of
folate to CVD has been mostly
explored through its effect on homocysteine, which has
been incriminated as an independent risk factor for CHD
and probably stroke56 – 59. Folic acid is required for the
methylation of homocysteine to methionine. Reduced
plasma folate has been strongly associated with plasma
elevated plasma homocysteine levels and folate sup-
plementation has been demonstrated to decrease those
levels60. However,
the role of homocysteine as an
independent risk factor for CVD has been subject
to
debate,
in view of the data from several prospective
studies which did not ﬁnd this association to be
independent of other risk factors61. It has also been
suggested that elevation of plasma homocysteine is a
consequence and not a cause of atherosclerosis, wherein
impaired renal
function due to atherosclerosis raises
plasma homocysteine levels62.

Whether homocysteinaemia is the cause or consequence
of atherosclerosis, its role in promoting thrombosis makes
an intervention with folate appear attractive. There is also
recent evidence that suggests that homocysteinaemia
results in endothelial dysfunction, an effect that is reversed
by oral folate supplementation63,64. An independent anti-
oxidant role for folate has also been postulated82. Data
from the Nurses’ Health Study showed that folate and
vitamin B6,
from diet and supplements, conferred
protection against CHD (fatal and non-fatal events
combined) and suggested a role for their increased intake
as an intervention for primary prevention of CHD65. Food
grain fortiﬁcation with folate and cyancobalamin has also
been recommended as a cost-effective measure for CHD
prevention66.

Recommendations related to folate supplementation
must, however, await the results of ongoing clinical trials.
Dietary intake of folate through natural food sources may
be encouraged in the meanwhile, especially in individuals
at a high risk of arterial or venous thrombosis and elevated
plasma homocysteine levels67.

Flavonoids and other phytochemicals
Flavonoids are polyphenolic anti-oxidants which occur in
a variety of foods of vegetable origin, such as tea, onions
and apples. Data from several prospective studies
indicate an inverse association of dietary ﬂavonoids
with CHD68. A beneﬁt on stroke risk has also been
reported69. However, confounding may be a major
problem and may explain conﬂicting results of observa-
tional studies on ﬂavonoids and CHD. Fruits and

have protective properties, including isothiocyanates and

indoles (found in cruciferous vegetables), sulphides
(found in onions and garlic), terpenes (found in citrus
oils) and phytoestrogens47. While their role in relation to
CVD risk is not clearly established and trial evidence
related to garlic supplements is generally not supportive,
their consumption in the natural food form may have
beneﬁts, which need to be evaluated.

Minerals: blood pressure and CVD

Sodium
High blood pressure (HBP) is a major risk factor for CHD
and both forms of stroke (ischaemic and haemorrhagic).
The relative risk of CVD for both systolic and diastolic
blood pressures, operates in a continuum of increasing
risk for rising pressure but the absolute risk of CVD is
considerably modiﬁed by co-existing risk factors70.

Of the many risk factors associated with HBP, the dietary
investigated has been daily sodium
exposure most
consumption. It has been studied extensively in animal
experimental models,
in epidemiological studies, con-
trolled clinical trials and in population studies on restricted
sodium intake70. Salt or sodium intake has been directly
correlated with mean blood pressure levels and preva-
lence of hypertension in many populations. Comprehen-
sive epidemiological evidence was provided by the
INTERSALT Study71,72 which investigated the relationship
of 24 hr urinary electrolyte excretion to blood pressure in
52 population groups across 32 countries, using standar-
dised methodology to provide comparable data. In adults
aged 20 – 59 years,
there was a signiﬁcant positive
relationship between urinary sodium excretion and
blood pressure across the 52 population samples. Further,
it was also observed that in four of these populations in
whom the mean 24 hr urinary sodium excretion was lower
than 100 mmol/d, systolic blood pressure did not rise with
age73.

The consequences of increased sodium consumption
accompanying urbanization, on blood pressure levels,
was demonstrated in the Kenyan Luo Migration Study
wherein rural farmers who traditionally consumed a low
salt diet were observed to have an elevation of blood
pressure when they migrated to an urban environment.
These migrants exhibited blood pressure levels higher
than rural controls and comparable to levels observed in
western populations74. This rise in blood pressure was
related to an increase in salt consumption and a reduced
dietary intake of potassium. An overview of observational
data in populations suggested that a difference in sodium
intake of 100 mmol/d could be associated with average
differences in systolic blood pressure of 5 mmHg at age
15– 19 years and 10 mmHg at age 60 – 69 years75. Diastolic
blood pressures are reduced by about half as much, but
the association increases with age and the magnitude of
the initial blood pressure. It was estimated that a universal
reduction in dietary intake of salt by 50 mmol/d would

Diet, nutrition and prevention of hypertension and CVD

lead to a 50% reduction in the number of people requiring
anti-hypertensive therapy, a 22% reduction in number of
deaths due to strokes and a 16% reduction in number of
deaths from CHD75.

A recently reported cohort study in Finland prospec-
tively followed up 1173 men and 1263 women aged 25 – 64
years, with complete data on 24 hr urinary sodium
excretion and cardiovascular risk factors76. The hazard
ratios for CHD, CVD and all cause mortality, associated
with a 100 mmol increase in 24 urinary sodium excretion,
were 1.51 (95% CI 1.14 – 2.00), 1.45 (1.14– 1.84) and 1.26
(1.06 – 1.50), respectively, in both men and women. The
frequency of acute coronary events, but not acute stroke
events,
rose signiﬁcantly with increasing sodium
excretion. Disaggregated analyses revealed signiﬁcant
risk ratios in men only and revealed that sodium predicted
mortality in men who were overweight. Despite the
limitations of such subgroup analyses,
the overall
increasing sodium excretion with CVD
association of
and all cause mortality further support
the evidence
linking increased sodium intake to adverse cardiovascular
health outcomes.

limited size, short duration and deﬁcient

Several clinical intervention trials, conducted to evaluate
the effects of dietary salt reduction on blood pressure
levels in hypertensive and normotensive individuals, have
been systematically reviewed14,77. Many of the earlier trials
were of
in
statistical power. Based on an overview of 32 methodo-
logically adequate trials (22 in hypertensive subjects and
12 in normotensive persons), Cutler et al.14 concluded that
a daily reduction in intake of sodium by 70 – 80 mmol was
associated with a lowering of blood pressure both in
hypertensive and normotensive individuals, with systolic
and diastolic blood pressure reductions of 4.8/1.9 mmHg
in the former and 2.5/1.1 mmHg in the latter. Clinical trials
have also demonstrated the sustained blood pressure
lowering effects of sodium restriction in infancy78, as well
as in the elderly in whom it provides a useful non-
pharmacologic therapy79.

The results of low sodium—DASH diet trial80 further
strengthen the conclusion that reduction of daily sodium
intake, through salt restricted diets, lowers blood pressure
effectively and is additive to the beneﬁts conferred by the
DASH diet. This trial revealed that low sodium diets, with
24 hr sodium excretion levels around 70 mmol/d, are
effective and safe. Sodium consumption has also been
linked to the presence of left ventricular hypertrophy81,82
and restricted sodium intake has been demonstrated to
result
indicator of
cardiovascular risk81,82.

in regression of

this important

Of three population studies on restriction of salt, two
(the Portuguese Salt Trial and the Tianjin trial in China)
revealed signiﬁcant reductions in blood pressure in the
intervention group, while the third (the Belgian Salt
Intervention Trial) did not reveal success because of
difﬁculties in reducing salt consumption83 – 85. Animal

175

models as well as ecological associations derived from the
INTERSALT suggest a direct relationship between sodium
consumption and the risk of stroke,
though the
methodology employed in these studies is not strong86,87.
Based on the observational and trial data so far
available, it would be justiﬁed to recommend a daily salt
intake of less than 5 g/d80. Such an advice would be
appropriate even in tropical climates, as sodium homeo-
stasis regulates sodium excretion in sweat and urine
without adverse effects under such conditions.

Potassium
Cardioprotective effects of dietary potassium have been
hypothesised as the basis for low CVD rates in populations
consuming ‘primitive’ diets and in vegetarians in
industrialised cultures88. The INTERSALT study provided
evidence of an inverse association between urinary
potassium excretion and blood pressure levels, across
diverse populations71. Migrant studies too revealed a rise
in blood pressure when diets changed to a lower
potassium and higher sodium intake74.

A protective effect of potassium on blood pressure was
suggested by clinical studies reporting that severe short-
term potassium restriction induces salt sensitivity in
normotensive humans89, well as the blood pressure
lowering effect of potassium supplements to the diet
(ranging from 24 to 104 mmol/d)
in hypertensive
subjects88. Whelton et al. concluded, from a meta-analysis
of
that potassium sup-
plements reduced mean blood pressures (systolic/dias-
tolic) by 1.8/1.0 mmHg in normotensive subjects and
4.4/2.5 mmHg in hypertensive subjects90. An increase in
dietary intake of potassium,
from approximately 60 –
80 mmol/d was shown to be inversely and signiﬁcantly
related to the incidence of stroke mortality in women91.

randomised controlled trials,

While dietary potassium has been shown to have
protective effects on blood pressure and CVD, there is no
evidence to suggest
long-term potassium sup-
plements should be administered for cardiovascular
protection. The beneﬁcial effects of fruit and vegetables
recommend their regular use in daily diets at a level that
should assure an adequate intake of dietary potassium.

that

Calcium and magnesium
A meta-analysis of studies involving calcium supplements
reveal modest effects on blood pressure. The estimated
blood pressure reduction was 2.1 mmHg for systolic blood
pressure and 1.1 mmHg for diastolic blood pressure92.
A review of 29 studies of magnesium was inconclusive due
to methodological problems but suggested that there was
no negative association of blood pressure with mag-
nesium93. There is presently no evidence to recommend
public health or clinical interventions involving the use of
these minerals for cardiovascular protection in popu-
lations or individuals, other than in the form of a balanced
diet providing an adequate daily intake.

176

Food items and food groups

Fruits and vegetables
While the consumption of fruit and vegetables has been
widely believed to promote good health, evidence related
to their protective effect has only been presented in recent
years94 – 96. A systematic review reported that nine of ten
ecological studies, two of three case – control studies and
six of sixteen cohort studies found a signiﬁcant protective
association for CHD with consumption of
fruit and
vegetables or surrogate nutrients96. For stroke, three of
ﬁve ecological studies and six of eight cohort studies
found a signiﬁcant protective association96.

A 5-year follow-up study of 39,876 female health
professionals97, observed a signiﬁcant inverse association
between fruit and vegetable intake and CVD risk. For
increasing quintiles of total fruit and vegetable intake, the
relative risks were 1.0, 0.78, 0.72, 0.68 and 0.68. After
excluding participants with a self-reported history of
diabetes, hypertension or high cholesterol at baseline, the
multi-variate adjusted relative risk was 0.45 when extreme
quintiles were compared (95% CI: 0.22, 0.91). In a 12-year
follow-up of 15,220 male physicians in United States98,
men who consumed at least 2.5 servings of vegetables per
day were observed to have an adjusted relative risk of 0.77
for CHD, compared with men in the lowest category
(, 1 serving per day).

Combining analyses of data from two large prospective
cohort studies of women and men, respectively, Joshipura
et al.6 reported that overall fruit and vegetable consump-
tion were inversely related to the risk of ischaemic stroke
after adjusting for confounders99. Assessed as a continuous
trend, an increment of 1 serving per day was associated
with 6% lower risk of ischaemic stroke among men and
women combined. When analysed separately for the type
of fruit and vegetables, the lowest risks were observed for
high consumption of cruciferous vegetables such as
Brussels sprouts, cabbage and cauliﬂower, green leafy ve-
getables, citrus fruits, vitamin C-rich fruits and vegetables.
The effects of increased fruit and vegetable consump-
tion on blood pressure alone or in combination with a
low-fat diet, were assessed in the DASH trial100. While the
combination diet was more effective in lowering blood
pressure, the fruit and vegetable diet too lowered the
blood pressure in comparison to the control diet
(2.8 mmHg systolic and 1.1 mmHg diastolic). Such
reductions, while seeming modest at the individual level,
would result in a substantial reduction in population wide
risk of CVD by shifting the blood pressure distribution.

Fish
Most, but not all, population studies have shown that ﬁsh
consumption in populations is associated with a reduced
risk of CHD101 – 103. A systematic review concluded that the
discrepancy in the studies may be due to differences in the
populations studied, with only high-risk individuals

KS Reddy and MB Katan

beneﬁting from increasing their ﬁsh consumption103. It
was estimated that, in high-risk populations, an optimum
ﬁsh intake estimated at 40 – 60 g/d would lead to
approximately a 50% reduction in death from CHD. In
the diet and reinfarction trial, 2 year mortality was reduced
by 29% in survivors of a ﬁrst myocardial infarction in
persons receiving advice to consume fatty ﬁsh at least
twice a week104. While the protective effects of ﬁsh on
CHD are principally mediated by n-3 PUFA,
the
contribution of other constituents of ﬁsh cannot be ruled
out. The effect of dietary ﬁsh on the risk of stroke has been
investigated in cohort studies, with conﬂicting results on
the risk of ischaemic stroke105,106. A recent study reported
that ﬁsh consumption is associated with a reduced risk of
death from all causes as well as CHD and stroke mortality,
using data from 36 countries107.

Nuts
Five large epidemiological studies have, thus far, demon-
strated that frequent consumption of nuts was associated
with decreased risk of CHD, the best known among them
being the Adventist Health Study108 – 111. The relative risk
ranged from 0.43 to 0.82 for subjects who consumed nuts
more than 5 times/week compared to those who never
consumed nuts. An inverse dose – response relationship
was demonstrated between the frequency of nut
consumption and the risk of CHD, in men as well as in
women. Most of these studies considered nuts as a group,
combining many types of nuts.

The effect of speciﬁc nuts on lipid and lipoprotein
endpoints were evaluated in several clinical studies. The
nuts studied to date include walnuts, almonds, legume
peanuts, macadamia nuts, pecans and pistachio nuts108.
Collectively, these clinical studies indicate that inclusion of
nuts in a lipid-lowering diet has favourable effects, but do
not provide unequivocal evidence of an additive effect of
nuts to the effects of a low saturated fat diet per se. The
fatty acid proﬁle of nuts (high in unsaturated fatty acids
and low in saturated fatty acids) contributes to cholesterol
lowering by altering the fatty acid composition of the diet
as a whole. Nuts are also a rich source of dietary ﬁbre. It
must, however, be recognised that the high-fat content of
nuts makes them high in calorie content and advice to
include nuts in the diet must be tempered in accordance
with the desired energy balance. While further research is
needed to characterise the independent protective effects
of nuts against CVD and identify the mechanisms of such
protection, available evidence suggests that nuts should be
recommended as part of an energy appropriate healthy
diet which is intended to reduce the risk of CHD.

Soy
Several trials indicate that intake of soy has a beneﬁcial
effect on plasma lipids112,113. A composite analysis of 38
clinical trials found that an average consumption of 47 g of
soy protein a day led to a 9% decline in total cholesterol

Diet, nutrition and prevention of hypertension and CVD

and a 13% decline in LDL cholesterol in subjects free of
CHD112. The beneﬁt of soy consumption was associated
with baseline cholesterol levels, such that those with the
highest cholesterol levels derived the maximum beneﬁt
(subjects with total cholesterol .335 mg/dL showed a 19%
reduction in total and 24% reduction in LDL cholesterol).
Cholesterol lowering of this magnitude could potentially
reduce the risk for CAD by 20 – 40%.

Soy is rich in isoﬂavones, compounds that are
structurally and functionally similar to estrogen. Several
animal experiments suggest that intake of these isoﬂa-
vones may provide protection against CHD114, but human
data on efﬁcacy and safety are still awaited. Naturally
occurring isoﬂavones, isolated with soy protein, reduced
the plasma concentrations of total and LDL cholesterol
without affecting the concentrations of triglycerides or
HDL cholesterol in mildly hypercholesterolemic individ-
uals, in a casein-controlled clinical trial115.

Dairy products
Milk and milk products are important contributors to
dietary fat and can be high in saturated fat and cholesterol.
They are also sources of minerals like potassium,
magnesium and calcium. Milk protein has been implicated
in a study reporting elevated levels of antibodies to milk
protein in patients of myocardial infarction in comparison
with healthy controls116. Dairy consumption has been
correlated positively, in an ecological study, with blood
cholesterol as well as coronary mortality. Milk consump-
tion correlates positively with coronary mortality rates in
43 countries and with myocardial mortality in 19 regions of
Europe117,118. In contrast, a population based study in men
of Japanese ancestry in Honolulu reported a reduced risk
of ischaemic stroke in older middle-aged men, which could
not be explained by the intake of dietary calcium119.

On the basis of presently available evidence, reduced
intake of high-fat dairy foods should be recommended for
cardiovascular protection. Whether milk or milk products
modiﬁed to substantially lower the content of saturated fat
are associated with an increase or decrease in cardiovas-
cular risk cannot be commented upon at present. They
formed a component of the DASH diet which signiﬁcantly
lowered blood pressure and may be considered as part of
a composite dietary advice.

Alcohol
The relationship of alcohol
to overall mortality and
cardiovascular mortality has generally been J-shaped,
when studied in western populations in whom the rates of
atherothrombotic vascular disorders are high120 – 124. The
protective effect of moderate ethanol consumption is
primarily mediated through its effect on the risk of CHD, as
supported by more than 60 prospective studies121. A
consistent coronary protective effect has been observed for
consumption of 1 – 2 drinks per day of an alcohol
containing beverage but heavy drinkers have higher total

177

mortality than moderate drinkers or abstainers, as do binge
drinkers. Moderate alcohol consumption (upto two drinks
per day) has also been associated with a reduced risk of
ischaemic stroke in men and women125. Long-term heavy
alcohol consumption (. 60 g/d) increases an individual’s
risk for all stroke subtypes.

Several mechanisms for the cardioprotective effects of
increase in plasma HDL
alcohol have been proposed:
cholesterol;
reduced platelet aggregation or clotting;
enhanced ﬁbrinolysis; phenolic constituents of some
alcoholic beverages acting as anti-oxidants or platelet
inhibitors126. Genetic variations which slow alcohol
metabolism have been shown to increase HDL cholesterol
and reduce the risk of myocardial infarction3. Based on
current evidence,
the beneﬁt of moderate alcohol
consumption seems to be a generic effect regardless of
the type of beverage127. While the speciﬁc advantages of
red wine over other alcoholic beverages is unproven, the
claimed beneﬁcial effects of ﬂavonoids on lipoprotein
oxidation are available from grape juice as from wine128.
The possible beneﬁcial effects of moderate ethanol
consumption must be weighed against the deleterious
effects of high intake,
including increased risk of
hypertension, cardiomyopathy and hemorrhagic stroke.
Alcohol consumption, in excess of three drinks per day, is
associated with a rise in blood pressure and plasma
triglyceride levels. Reduction or cessation of alcohol
consumption is a widely recommended measure for non-
pharmacologic therapy of hypertension, in many inter-
national guidelines. The recommendations related to
alcohol should be made in accordance with the cultural
practices of the populations and the clinical proﬁle of
individuals, with advice to avoid excess in all cases. The
optimal intake, for cardiovascular protection, depends on
age, gender, presence of other risk factors or associated
diseases and on the intake of folic acid. However, it is
generally recommended to be about two drinks a day for
men and one a day for women.

Eggs
They are unique because of their high-cholesterol content.
Major effects on atherosclerosis are observed in exper-
imental animals but extrapolation to humans is doubtful.
A large observational study suggested that there was no
increase in the risk of CHD up to one egg per day (except
in a diabetic subgroup), in the US population129. In terms
of global recommendations, it may still be prudent to limit
the intake to 3 – 4 eggs per week.

Dietary patterns and composite dietary
interventions

The Mediterranean diet
The traditional Mediterranean diet has been described to
have eight components: (i) high monounsaturated-to-
saturated fat ratio, (ii) moderate ethanol consumption,

178

(iii) high consumption of legumes, (iv) high consumption
of cereals (including bread), (v) high consumption of fruits,
(vi) high consumption of vegetables, (vii) low consump-
tion of meat and meat products and (viii) moderate
consumption of milk and dairy products130. Most of these
are found in many diets. The characteristic component is
olive oil, and many equate a Mediterranean diet with
consumption of olive oil.

Based on ecological comparisons, Keys et al.131
hypothesised that traditional Mediterranean diet conferred
protection against CVD and several other disorders,
principally because of a low saturated fat content. Three
prospective population studies in Greece, Denmark and
Australia provided supportive evidence of protective
effects on overall mortality132. However, this traditional
form of
‘Mediterranean diet’ has not been tested in
controlled clinical trials.

A secondary prevention trial of dietary intervention in
survivors of a ﬁrst recent myocardial infarction, which
aimed to study the cardioprotective effects of a ‘Mediterra-
nean type’ of diet, actually left out its most characteristic
component, olive oil133. This diet was designed to supply
, 35% of energy as fat, , 10% of energy as saturated fat,
, 4% of the energy as LA (n-6) and . 0.6% of energy as
ALNA (n-3). The main fat source was rapeseed oil.
Vegetables and fruits were also increased in the diet. Two
major biological factors were modiﬁed by the intervention:
plasma levels of a-tocopherol and ascorbic acid were
elevated and plasma n-3 fatty acids increased along with a
decrease in n-6 fatty acids. Other biological mediators of
altered risk,
folate and minerals like
potassium were probably altered but not measured. While
the initial publication reported a 70% reduction in
recurrence of myocardial infarction and cardiac death,
the 4-year follow-up study reported a 72% reduction in
cardiac death and non-fatal myocardial infarction. The risk
of overall mortality was lowered by 56%11.

like ﬂavonoids,

Vegetarian diets
A reduced risk of CVD has been reported in populations of
vegetarians living in afﬂuent countries134 – 136 and in case–
control comparisons in developing countries137. Reduced
consumption of animal fat and increased consumption of
fruit, vegetables, nuts and cereals may underlie such a
protective effect. However, vegetarian diets per se need
not be healthful136. If not well planned, they can contain a
large amount of reﬁned carbohydrates and t-FAs while
being deﬁcient
in the levels of vegetable and fruit
consumption. The composition of the vegetarian diet
should,
its cardio
protective constituents rather than use or endorse the
‘vegetarian’ label as an omnibus category.

therefore, be deﬁned in terms of

‘Prudent’ vs. ‘western’ patterns
Using factor analysis on a 131-item food frequency
questionnaire, Hu et al.
identiﬁed two major dietary

KS Reddy and MB Katan

patterns at baseline in 44,875 men followed up for 8 years
in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study138. The
‘prudent’ pattern was characterised by higher intake of
vegetables, fruit, legumes, whole grains, ﬁsh and poultry
whereas the ‘western’ pattern was characterised by higher
intake of red meat, processed meat, reﬁned grains, sweets
and dessert, French fries and high-fat dairy products. After
adjustment for age and other coronary risk factors, relative
risks, from the lowest
to the highest quintiles of the
prudent pattern score, were 1.0, 0.87, 0.79, 0.75 and 0.70.
In contrast, the relative risks, across increasing quintiles of
the western pattern, were 1.0, 1.21, 1.36, 1.40 and 1.64.
These associations persisted in subgroup analyses
according to cigarette smoking, body mass index and
parental history of myocardial infarction.

DASH Diets
The effects of composite dietary interventions on blood
pressure levels,
in ‘normotensive’ and ‘hypertensive’
individuals, were studied in well designed clinical
trials80,100. The initial dietary intervention, used in the
dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) trial
involved a diet that emphasised fruits, vegetables and low-
fat dairy products and included whole grains, poultry, ﬁsh
and nuts while reducing the amounts of red meat, sweets
and sugar containing beverages. Two variants of the
intervention diet were used: a fruit and vegetables (F – V)
diet and a low-fat F– V (DASH) diet. The latter was
designed to lower the intake of total and saturated fat as
well as dietary cholesterol. In comparison with a ‘typical’
diet in the United States, both intervention diets lowered
blood pressure but the DASH diet was more effective in
substantially reducing systolic and diastolic blood press-
ures, both in people with hypertension and in those
without hypertension80. The DASH diet was also demon-
strated to be effective as ﬁrst-line therapy in individuals
with stage I isolated systolic hypertension (i.e. with a
systolic blood pressure of 140 – 159 mmHg and a diastolic
blood pressure below 90 mmHg), with 78% of the persons
on the DASH diet reducing their systolic blood pressure to
, 140 mmHg,
in comparison to 24% in the control
group139. The DASH diet resulted in lowering plasma
levels of total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol but these
changes were also accompanied by a reduction in HDL
levels140. While the Framingham risk score
cholesterol
improved as a result of the impact on total and LDL
cholesterol as well as blood pressure, the impact of the
associated reduction in HDL cholesterol needs to be
assessed.

The DASH trial was followed by a well designed
factorial
trial combining the DASH diet with high,
intermediate and low levels of sodium consumption
and measuring the effects on blood pressure,
in
comparison to a control diet typical of the United States,
administered with similar graded variations in the sodium
content100. Within each assigned group (DASH vs.

Diet, nutrition and prevention of hypertension and CVD

typical), participants ate foods with high intermediate and
low levels of sodium for 30 consecutive days each, in
random order. Reduction in sodium intake, at each level,
resulted in signiﬁcant lowering of systolic and diastolic
blood pressures in both DASH and control groups. The
fall was, however, maximal when the DASH diet was
modiﬁed to reduce the sodium content. As compared
with the control diet with a high sodium level, the DASH
diet with a low sodium level led to a mean systolic blood
pressure that was 7.1 mmHg lower in participants without
hypertension and 11.5 mmHg lower in participants with
hypertension. There was also a 2 4.5 mmHg difference in
the mean diastolic pressure level, between the low
sodium-DASH diet phase and the high sodium-control
diet phase of the trial.

The effects of the low sodium-DASH diet have a great
potential for application in both population based and
individual focused strategies for prevention and control
of HBP and associated CVD. Adoption of
the low
sodium-DASH diet, by populations at large, is likely to be
safe and beneﬁcial in shifting the population distributions
of blood pressure (and plasma cholesterol) towards
lower
levels of cumulative risk of CVD in those
populations. Similarly,
this diet will also provide an
effective non-pharmacological therapeutic intervention in
the clinical management of individuals identiﬁed to be at
an increased risk of CVD because of HBP and associated
risk factors.

Japanese diet
The traditional Japanese diet has attracted much attention
because of the highest life expectancy and low CHD
mortality rates among the Japanese141, 142. This diet is low
in fat and sugar and includes soy, seaweeds, raw ﬁsh and a
predominant use of rice. It has been high in salt, but salt
consumption has recently been declining in response to
Japanese Health Ministry guidelines. There is also recent
trend towards increased fat consumption and plasma
cholesterol levels have risen, and their effects on CHD and
CVD mortality rates need to be watched.

Implications for policy

The rising global burden of CVD requires a rapid response
that integrates policies and programmes which enable
effective prevention and control in diverse geographical
and resource settings. Diet and nutrition play a critical role
in the causation of major CVDs and, along with physical
activity,
inﬂuence many of the biologic variables that
mediate the risk of those diseases. There is, therefore, an
opportunity to alter the direction and dimensions of
the global CVD epidemic through policy interventions
(at the local, national and global levels), which promote
the availability, affordability and acceptability of health
promoting diets and restrain the marketing and consump-
tion of unhealthy foods.

179

Currently available evidence strongly indicates that
cardiovascular health is strongly inﬂuenced by the quality
of dietary fat and the quantity of fruits and vegetables as
well as salt consumed daily. While several other food items
also contribute to enhanced or decreased risk of CVD,
these remain the principal determinants of diet related
CVD risk. Whether
the evidence is derived from
demonstration projects, controlled clinical
trials or an
ecological study of reasons for sharp decrease in coronary
mortality in Poland since 1991, the evidence suggests that
dietary changes can substantially alter the risk of CVD143.
Policies must,
therefore, address these directly and
decisively.

These measures must encompass a wide range of
educational as well as regulatory measures, acting through
price and non-price mechanisms. That success in reducing
CVD risk factor
levels as well as CVD mortality is
achievable through such measures that inﬂuence usual
diet patterns is clear from the experience of developed
countries144. Developing countries like Mauritius too have
shown that population levels of CVD risk factors can be
altered by a combination of community education and
regulatory interventions related to the price of edible
oils145. Measures to inﬂuence the quality of dietary fat (as
well as the total quantity) consumed must address the
elimination of trans-fats and reduction of saturated fats
from the daily diet. Governments must work with the food
industry to inﬂuence production, processing, pricing and
labelling of food products so that these goals can be met.
Consumer education must be enhanced so that informed
choices can be made, even as the availability of healthier
foods is promoted through such measures. As market
economy becomes a globally pervasive economic model,
it must be recognised that markets are not autonomous
entities and should be moulded, for public good, by
consumer consciousness as well as enlightened regulatory
measures.

Edible oil production and pricing is a case where such
policy measures are strongly indicated. Global nutrition
transition is being propelled by the increasing availability
and utilisation of vegetable oils
in developing
countries146. The production of oils for mass consump-
tion, with respect to SFA, MFA and PUFA content as well
as preferential pricing of low-SFA oils are areas of policy
which need early attention and action. Mixture of edible
oils for marketing and genetic modiﬁcation of crops, for
attainting optimal
fatty acid ratios are options to
consider42,147. The production, preservation, processing,
distribution and pricing of fresh fruits and vegetables
(especially green leafy vegetables) require agricultural
and trade policies that ensure their availability for
universal consumption in adequate quantities. The
ambit of policy change has to encompass and integrate
a variety of local and global responses, from community
based programmes for increasing local production and
self-sufﬁciency to national programmes that usher in a

180

‘rainbow revolution’ to global trade policies that do not
promote polarised consumption of these essential foods
only in some countries.

The goals of cardiovascular health need to be reconciled
with other public health objectives, as in the case of salt.
Reduced salt consumption must be promoted through a
combination of community education, altered production
practices in food manufacturing and labelling of marketed
food products for their salt content. At the same time, it
must be recognised that salt is now being widely used and
advocated as a vehicle for iodine delivery through diet.
There is a clear need for ensuring that these two public
health programmes do not collide in their intent and
operations, perhaps by increasing the iodine concen-
tration in salt or choosing alternate modes of iodine
delivery.

Globalisation offers a formidable challenge to the
implementation of nutritional policies at the national level,
as relevant to the needs of cardiovascular health. From
documented evidence of the extensive diversion of fruits
from domestic to export markets148 to the recent UNEP
caution on the consequences of selling ﬁshing rights149, it
is a matter of concern that developing countries are
increasingly losing nutrient rich food resources, which
adversely affect local consumption. At the same time, the
growth of the global fast food industry and the rapid
penetration of high-salt, high-SFA, high-energy processed
foods into developing country markets is promoting the
consumption of

health. Global and national policies, in agriculture and
trade, must speedily address these concerns and ﬁnd
sustainable solutions.

Even in clinical practice, the role of diet as an effective
instrument of primary and secondary prevention of CVD
must be emphasised. National and international guide-
lines must accord this component due prominence and
provide clarity of content. In terms of implementation of

Table 1 Evidence for diet and risk of CVD

these guidelines, health professionals must be trained to
comprehend and communicate dietary advice through
counselling contacts with individuals and groups.
Dietary advice must not be regarded merely as a
‘politically correct’ adjunct to a pharmacologic prescrip-
tion but must be treated as an effective pathway to risk
reduction. Food-based dietary guidelines too need to be
developed, as appropriate to local, regional or national
context
to enable people, patients, professionals and
policy makers to clearly identify the practical dietary
measures required to promote cardiovascular health.

Such proactive policy and programme initiatives to
promote and protect global cardiovascular health through
diet and nutrition need to be brought onto the national and
global health agenda through multi-institutional collabor-
ation and implemented through inter-sectoral coordi-
nation. It would require wide ranging public – private
partnerships as well as a strong participation by the
voluntary sector to advance this agenda. WHO and FAO are
best positioned to inform and invigorate such global and
national action, through their Member States and partners.

Diet and CVD: summary of evidence and
recommendations

Based on the experimental and observational evidence
reviewed in the foregoing sections, the risk associations of
dietary constituents with CVD (CHD/HBP/stroke/arrhyth-
mias) may be summarised as follows (Table 1).

Dietary recommendations

sition of fats in the diet, strongly inﬂuences the risk of
CVDs like CHD and stroke, through effects on blood

chloride intake of 4 g/d) is beneﬁcial in reducing blood
pressure and is not associated with adverse effects.

For promoting cardiovascular health, diets should

should be achieved by:

. A low intake of SFAs: less than 7% of daily energy intake
(within these limits, intake of foods rich in myristic and
palmitic acids should be especially reduced).

. A very low intake of t-FAs (hydrogenated oils and fats):

less than 1% of daily energy intake.

. Adequate intake of PUFAs: 6 – 10% of daily energy
intake, with an optimal balance of n-6 and n-3 PUFA at
5 – 8% and 1 – 2% levels of daily energy intake,
respectively.

. Intake of MUFA to make up the rest of daily energy
intake from fats, with daily total fat intake ranging
between 15 and 30% of daily energy intake (this may be
based on current levels of population consumption in
different regions and modiﬁed in accordance with age,
activity and goals of body weight).

. While there is no evidence that links the quantity of
dietary fat to CVD, independent of the effects of fat
composition and unhealthy weight gain,
there are
concerns over potential excess energy consumption
associated with an unrestricted fat intake. These support
a recommendation that fat intake should not exceed
30% of daily energy intake. However, in very active
groups with healthy dietary practices and stable healthy
weight, fat intake may go up to 35% of energy.

. Dietary cholesterol consumption should be restricted to
less than 300 mg/d, mainly through the restriction of
dairy fats.

. These dietary goals can be met by limiting the intake of
fat from dairy and meat sources, avoiding the use of
hydrogenated oils and fats in cooking and manufacture
of food products, using appropriate edible vegetable
oils in moderation, regular intake of ﬁsh (1 – 2 times per
week) and/or plant sources of ALNA. Practices of food
preparation should preferentially employ non-frying
methods.

Fruits and vegetables
Fruits and vegetables contribute to cardiovascular health
through a variety of phyto-nutrients, potassium and ﬁbre.
Daily intake of
fresh fruit and vegetables (including
berries, green leafy and cruciferous vegetables and
legumes),
in an adequate quantity (400 – 500 g/d) is
recommended to reduce the risk of CHD, stroke and HBP.

Sodium
inﬂuences
Dietary intake of sodium, from all sources,
blood pressure levels in populations and should be limited
so as to reduce the risk of CHD and both forms of stroke.
Current evidence suggests that an intake of 70 mmol or
1.7 g of sodium per day (equivalent to a daily sodium

. Restricting daily salt (sodium chloride) intake to less
than 5 g/d. This will enable many populations to move
towards the goal of around 4 g/d, from their current
high intakes. This should take into account total sodium
intake from all dietary sources.

. Minimising other forms of sodium consumption such as
through food additives or preservatives, such as
monosodium glutamate (MSG).

Potassium
Dietary intake of potassium lowers blood pressure and
is protective against stroke and cardiac arrhythmias.
Potassium intake should be at a level which will keep the
sodium:potassium ratio close to 1, i.e. at daily potassium
intake levels of 70 – 80 mmol/d. This may be achieved
through adequate daily consumption of
fruits and
vegetables. Such a balance may also be obtained through
use of potassium enriched low sodium salt substitutes.

Non-starch polysaccharides (commonly referred to as
ﬁbre)
Fibre is protective against CHD and has also been used in
blood pressure lowering diets. Adequate intake may be
achieved through fruits, vegetables and whole grain
cereals.

Fish
Regular ﬁsh consumption, as consumed on a weekly basis,
is protective against CHD and ischaemic stroke and is
recommended for persons whose cultural beliefs do no
prohibit the consumption of ﬁsh. The consumption of ﬁsh
and other marine foods should provide over 200 mg/d of
DHA and EPA.

Alcohol
While regular low to moderate consumption of alcohol
is protective against CHD, concerns about other
cardiovascular and health risks associated with alcohol
consumption (including stroke, hypertension and some
cancers) do not favour a general recommendation for
its use.

Research recommendations

i. Clinical trials using composite dietary interventions
(such as the low sodium-DASH diet or a low
sodium-Lyon diet) to evaluate the impact on:

. comprehensive (absolute) cardiovascular

risk
incorporating multiple cardiovascular

proﬁle,
risk factors

182

. cardiovascular events (fatal and non-fatal MI,

stroke and sudden cardiac death)

. total mortality.

ii. Clinical trials to evaluate the impact of ALNA, as a
sole dietary intervention, on cardiovascular end-
points and total mortality.

iii. Demonstration projects, in developing countries, to
evaluate the impact of culturally appropriate
interventions incorporating principles of healthy
diets and regular physical activity on cardiovascular
risk factors distributions in populations. This should
also incorporate research into the factors that
determine and inﬂuence change in health beha-
viours related to dietary intake and physical activity.
iv. Policy research to evaluate the impact of current
agricultural and trade practices on dietary patterns in
different national/regional settings.

Recommendations to national governments

i. Develop and implement

food and agriculture
policies, which will enable adequate production
and domestic supply of fruits, vegetables and whole
grain cereals, at affordable prices to all segments of
the population.

ii. Develop and implement policies related to edible oil
production and domestic supply, which will enable
consumers to exercise healthier choices, in accord-
ance with the nutrient recommendations made in
this report.

iii. Employ regulatory measures to restrict the hydro-
genation of oils and fats intended for dietary
consumption or manufacture of food products.

iv. Enact and enforce measures for labelling of food
products, with respect to their sodium and fatty acid
content, with clear codes, which will enable
consumers to readily identify products with high
sodium and/or fatty acid content.

v. Develop and implement policies, which will enable
adequate sustainable supply of ﬁsh in domestic
markets.

vi. Facilitate the development of national food based
dietary guidelines through consultation with nutri-
tion experts and community representatives.

vii. Develop and implement policies involving urban
planning and transport
to create facilities for
supporting regular physical activity by all people
of all ages.

viii. Develop national standards for manufacture and

marketing of fats and oils.

ix. Utilise mass communication channels to promote
national and community-based nutrition education.

Recommendations to UN/bilateral agencies

i. Facilitate the development of global trade policies
which will ensure adequate supply of health

promoting foods to all population groups of the
world,
through appropriate measures related to
production subsidies, pricing and transnational
movement (WTO, WHO, FAO).

ii. Facilitate the development of national food based

dietary guidelines,
agencies (WHO, FAO).

iii. Assist in developing and testing models of commu-
nity empowerment,
involving local production,
nutrition education and enhanced consumer con-
sciousness (WHO, UNDP, UNICEF).

iv. Support research for developing and testing culture-
speciﬁc interventions for promoting population-
wide changes in dietary preferences and practices as
well as regular physical activity (WHO, FAO,
Bilateral Agencies).

v. Undertake country case-studies of the effects of
agricultural and trade practices on nutrition and
health (WHO, FAO).

Recommendations to industry

i. Make low sodium and low fat foods widely available
in the market, through appropriate manufacturing
practices and lower the sodium content of regularly
consumed foods like breads and cereals.

ii. Implement effective food labelling practices that will
help consumers exercise informed choice with
respect
to sodium and fatty acid content of
purchased foods.

Abstract

Background—There have been discrepant findings on the association between coffee
consumption and risk of incident heart failure.
Methods and Results—We conducted a systematic review and a dose-response meta-analysis
of prospective studies that assessed the relationship between habitual coffee consumption and the
risk of heart failure. We searched electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cinahl) from
January 1966 through December 2011 with the use of a standardized protocol. Eligible studies
were prospective cohort studies that examined the association of coffee consumption with incident
heart failure. Five independent prospective studies of coffee consumption and heart failure risk,
including 6,522 heart failure events and 140,220 participants were included in the meta-analysis.
We observed a statistically significant J-shaped relationship between coffee and heart failure.
Compared to no consumption, the strongest inverse association was seen for 4 servings/day, and a
potentially higher risk at higher levels of consumption. There was no evidence that the relationship
between coffee and heart failure risk varied by sex or by baseline history of MI or diabetes.
Conclusions—Moderate coffee consumption is inversely associated with risk of heart failure,
with the largest inverse association observed for consumption of 4 servings per day.

consumption, the risk of hospitalization or death from heart failure was 17% higher (95%
confidence interval 1.05-1.30) among men who consumed 5 or more cups of coffee per day.
This finding served as the basis for the suggestion in the most recent statement from the
American Heart Association on heart failure prevention,2 stating that coffee may increase
heart failure risk. However, the Wilhelmsen analysis did not adjust for any potential
confounders. Subsequent studies have shown that coffee may protect against heart failure
incidence3 or that no association exists.4, 5 One study6 found an inverse association that was
statistically significant among women, but not men. However, most of these studies did not
have sufficient power to detect modest results.

Since the results have been inconsistent and the prior studies had limited power, we
conducted a systematic review and a dose-response meta-analysis of prospective studies that
assess the relation between habitual coffee consumption and the risk of heart failure.

We followed the Meta-Analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology7 protocol
throughout the design, implementation, analysis, and reporting for this study.

Literature Search Strategy

We performed a literature search of the CINAHL, Embase and PubMed databases from
January 1966 through December 2011 using the key words “coffee” and “heart failure”
without restrictions. We also reviewed the reference lists of retrieved articles. We reviewed
all articles with an abstract suggesting that it was relevant. Prospective cohort studies were
included if they reported odds ratios (ORs) or incidence rate ratios (IRRs) with 95%
confidence intervals (CI) of heart failure incidence or mortality.

Data extraction

The following details were recorded for each study: author, year of publication, cohort/study
name, geographic location of study, study period, participants' sex, age range at baseline,
health at baseline (no prior MI, prior MI, history of diabetes) and outcome (nonfatal or fatal,
primary or secondary cause). For each study, we obtained information about the levels of
coffee intake, the number of cases and the total population or person-time at risk at each
exposure level, the adjusted estimates of the odds ratio or incidence rate ratio compared with
abstention for each exposure level, and the corresponding lower and upper 95% confidence
intervals (95% CI) of the adjusted IRRs.

We extracted the relative risks for the models with the greatest degree of adjustment for
potentially confounding variables, but if an additional model was reported that further
adjusted for potential intermediates of the association between coffee and heart failure, we
used the data from the model that did not include the intermediates. Data abstraction was
conducted independently by two investigators (EM, MSR), with disagreements adjudicated
by a third reader (MAM). For articles that did not include all of the necessary data for the
meta-analysis, we contacted authors for additional information.

Statistical analysis

Since some studies used different categories of coffee consumption, we conducted a dose-
response meta-analysis to assess the pooled dose-response relation between coffee
consumption and risk of heart failure for studies that considered at least three levels of
coffee consumption including the reference category. For every study, the median or mean
coffee intake for each category was assigned to each corresponding odds ratio or incidence
rate ratio. When the median or mean intake per category was not provided by the study

authors, we assigned the midpoint of the upper and lower boundaries in each category as the
average intake. If the lower or upper boundary for the lowest and highest category
respectively was not reported, we assumed that the boundary had the same magnitude as the
closest category.

We used the method described by Greenland and Longnecker8 to compute study-specific
odds ratios or incidence rate ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CI) from the natural
logarithms of the relative risks and confidence intervals across categories of coffee
consumption. To examine a potential nonlinear relationship between coffee intake and heart
failure risk, we performed a 2-stage random-effects dose–response meta-analysis, as
summarized recently.9 At the first stage, we constructed study-specific restricted cubic
spline models with 4 knots at fixed percentiles (5% 35% 65% 95%) of the exposure
distribution10 assuming the fixed effects model. At the second stage, we combined the
study-specific estimates and the variance/covariance matrix that had been estimated within
each study using a random-effects model for meta-analysis.11 We conducted a test for the
overall significance of the curve by testing the joint impact of the spline transformations. We
examined whether a nonlinear relationship exists by testing the null hypothesis that the
regression coefficients of the spline transformations are all equal to zero. We assessed
whether our results were different for men and women and for results based on people with
versus without a prior myocardial infarction or diabetes at baseline. We did not have
sufficient statistical power to formally assess differences between these subgroups, so we
conducted stratified analyses and reported a qualitative assessment of any differences. We
carried out sensitivity analyses excluding one study at a time to explore whether the results
were driven by a single large study.

Statistical heterogeneity among studies was assessed using the I2 statistic.12 Possible
publication bias was evaluated with Egger's regression asymmetry test.13 All statistical
analyses were conducted using SAS 9.2 (SAS Institute, Inc., 2003) and the metadose macro9
with 2-tailed α set at p≤0.05 for statistical significance.

The search identified 116 publications, and after excluding 27 duplicates, an additional 84
articles were excluded after review of the title or abstract (Figure 1). The meta-analysis
included five1, 3-6 independent prospective studies of coffee consumption and heart failure
risk published between 2001 and 2011 (Table). Combined, these studies included 6,522heart
failure events among 140,220 participants. Four of the studies were conducted in
Sweden1, 3-5 and one was conducted in Finland.6 Three of the studies consisted of
participants with no history of myocardial infarction (MI),1, 5, 6 one consisted of participants
with a history of MI,3 and one included separate analyses for people with and without a
history of diabetes or MI.4 Two of the studies included men,1, 4 one included women5 and
two included both men and women.3, 6

We found a nonlinear association between coffee consumption and heart failure risk (p for
nonlinearity =0.02; p for overall significance of curve=0.02) (Figure 2a). Compared with no
coffee consumption, the pooled relative risk for heart failure was 0.96 (95% CI 0.90 -0.99)
for 1-2 servings/day, 0.93 (95% CI 0.86 to 0.99) for 2-3 servings/day,0.90 (95% CI
0.82-0.99) for 3-4 servings/day, 0.89 (95% CI 0.81-0.99) for 4-5 servings/day, 0.91 (95% CI
0.83-1.01) for 5-6 servings/day, 0.93 (95% CI 0.85-1.02) for 6-7 servings/day, 0.95 (95% CI
0.87-1.05) for 7-8 servings/day, 0.97 (95% CI 0.89-1.07) for 8-9 servings per day, 0.99
(95%CI 0.90-1.10) for 9-10 servings/day, 1.01 (95%CI 0.90-1.14) for 10-11 servings/day
and 1.03 (95% CI 0.89-1.19) for 11 servings/day.

The relationship between coffee consumption and heart failure incidence did not vary by sex
or by history of myocardial infarction or diabetes. The results were not meaningfully altered
in sensitivity analyses excluding one study at a time. In a sensitivity analysis excluding the
one study that did not adjust for potential confounders,1 the curve is shifted slightly to the
right, indicating that the inverse association exists for most levels of observed coffee
consumption. There was moderate between-study heterogeneity among study-specific
estimates (I2=37.5%). Egger's regression test provided no evidence of substantial publication
bias (p=0.17), but since we had a small number of studies, formal assessment of publications
bias may not be appropriate.

Discussion

The results of this meta-analysis of five independent prospective studies indicate that there is
a statistically significant J-shaped relationship between coffee and heart failure, with the
strongest inverse association observed for 4 servings per day (11% lower risk) and returns to
baseline beyond 10 cups of coffee per day. In stratified analyses, there was no evidence that
the relationship varied by sex or by baseline history of MI or diabetes.

While heart failure shares many risk factors with other cardiovascular diseases, such as
hyperlipidemia, obesity and increasing age, elevated blood pressure and diabetes mellitus
are particularly strong risk factors for heart failure.2 Experimental studies have consistently
shown that coffee and caffeine are associated with acutely raised blood pressure,14, 15
circulating concentrations of (nor)epinephrine, increased arterial stiffness and impaired
endothelium dependent vasodilation.16 For instance, Noordzij15 reported that for every cup
of coffee consumed, systolic pressure increased by 2.04 mmHg (95% CI 1.10 to 2.99) and
diastolic pressure by 0.73 mmHg (95% CI, 0.14 to 1.31). Findings from studies of habitual
consumption and heart disease have been inconsistent16, 17 with reports from case-control
studies showing increased risk and prospective studies showing either an increased risk, no
association or that coffee is protective against cardiovascular disease.18 A recent meta-
analysis reported that habitual light to moderate coffee consumption (1 to 3 cups/day)
increased the risk of developing hypertension, but more frequent consumption (>3 cups/day)
posed no increased risk.19 These findings are concordant with trials showing that one
develops a tolerance to the acute hemodynamic effects of caffeine in response to habitual
moderate consumption.16 There is also consistent evidence that frequent coffee consumption
is associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes, with most studies showing greater
reductions in diabetes risk with higher levels of coffee consumption.20, 21

Despite the small number of studies included in the meta-analyses, it consisted of high
quality prospective studies with large samples, many cases and a long duration of follow-up.
Our meta-analysis cannot address any confounding that may remain in the adjusted analyses
of the original studies, though all but one1 of the studies included in our meta-analysis
accounted for important confounders such as age, body mass index, alcohol consumption
and smoking status. The studies relied on self-reported coffee consumption, which may
involve misclassification of coffee intake. This may impact the location of the nadir in our
risk curve and make it difficult to detect statistically significant associations. However, since
these studies were prospective, the misclassification of coffee consumption is unlikely to
vary by the future incidence of heart failure. In all of the studies, coffee consumption was
measured at a single time point, which does not allow for examination of the effect of
changing consumption. Because there is a common belief that coffee is harmful, people with
health conditions may lower their coffee consumption, but most of the studies included in
this analysis were restricted to people with no MI or diabetes at baseline, and in a sensitivity
analysis, the results were similar when we excluded the studies that enrolled people with a
history of MI or diabetes.

The studies included in this meta-analysis may have involved consumption of different types
of coffee (e.g., caffeinated vs. decaffeinated coffee). However, in Sweden22 and Finland,23
most of the coffee consumed is caffeinated. Although we cannot examine whether heart
failure risk varies by coffee type, prior studies did not find differences in the risk of
hypertension for caffeinated versus decaffeinated coffee24, 25, and since hypertension is a
strong risk factor for heart failure, it is possible that protection against heart failure would
not differ between caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee. The included studies may have
involved different methods of coffee preparation (e.g., filtered, boiled, espresso). The impact
of boiled coffee, which contains the higher concentrations of cholesterol-raising oils,14
should be examined in future research. All of the included studies involved participants from
Nordic countries with high consumption of caffeinated coffee; future research in other
countries and populations that drink decaffeinated coffee would help elucidate whether
decaffeinated coffee impacts heart failure risk.

The findings are reported in terms of servings per day, but coffee intake is determined by the
strength of the brew and the size of the coffee serving. Stronger brews may have higher
levels of caffeine, antioxidants and other compounds that in turn impact cardiovascular
health. The brew is usually weaker in the US than in Europe, but the size of a standard
serving of coffee is larger in the US (250 mL) than in Europe (125-150 mL).20 In the
Swedish nutrition database, a standard cup of coffee is 150 mL and in the Finnish study, a
serving was defined as 100 mL. Therefore, our finding of a nadir of risk for 4 cups of coffee
per day may seem like a large amount, but based on the current US serving size, this is only
slightly more than two cups of coffee at popular coffee chains, where a standard serving size
varies from 295 to 590 mL, and this does not take into account the strength of the brew.

There is some suggestion that baseline history of hypertension may modify the impact of
coffee on cardiovascular risk26-28 and there is substantial evidence that the CYP1A2
genotype modifies the association between coffee consumption and cardiovascular risk,29 so
it seems plausible that the relationship between coffee consumption and heart failure risk
varies by genotype. Further research is necessary to examine these potential modifiers of the
coffee-heart failure relationship. There are several aspects of the relationship between coffee
and heart failure which we were not able to explore, such as the potential heart failure risk
from different types of coffee and brewing methods, the associations in non-European
populations and the relationship between coffee consumption and heart failure prognosis.

In summary, the results of this meta-analysis indicate that there is a J-shaped relationship
between coffee consumption and heart failure incidence with a modest inverse association
with moderate consumption. These results were robust to sensitivity analyses excluding
studies that may include participants with different baseline risk of heart failure. In light of
these findings, the current heart failure prevention guidelines2 suggesting that coffee poses
harmful effects may warrant revision to reflect the research showing that coffee may in fact
provide moderate protection against heart failure incidence.

The most recent statement on heart failure prevention from the American Heart
Association states that coffee may increase heart failure risk, but the results from prior
studies have yielded inconsistent results and these studies did not have sufficient power
to detect modest associations. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review and a dose-
response meta-analysis of prospective studies that assessed the relationship between
habitual coffee consumption and the risk of heart failure. The results of this meta-analysis
indicate that there is a J-shaped relationship between coffee consumption and heart
failure incidence with a modest inverse association with moderate consumption. In light
of these findings, the current heart failure prevention guidelines suggesting that coffee
poses harmful effects may warrant revision to reflect the research showing that coffee
may in fact provide moderate protection against heart failure incidence.

Does Tea Affect Cardiovascular Disease? Peters et al.
ORIGINAL CONTRIBUTIONS

Does Tea Affect Cardiovascular Disease? A Meta-Analysis

Ulrike Peters,1,2 Charles Poole,1 and Lenore Arab1

This  meta-analysis  of  tea  consumption  in  relation  to  stroke,  myocardial  infarction,  and  all  coronary  heart
disease is based on 10 cohort studies and seven case-control studies. The study-specific effect estimates for
stroke and coronary heart disease were too heterogeneous to be summarized (homogeneity p < 0.02 for stroke,
p < 0.001 for coronary heart disease). Only the relative risk estimates for myocardial infarction (seven studies)
appeared  reasonably  homogeneous  (homogeneity  p =  0.20). The  incidence  rate  of  myocardial  infarction  is
estimated to decrease by 11% with an increase in tea consumption of 3 cups per day (fixed-effects relative risk
estimate  =  0.89,  95%  confidence  interval: 0.79,  1.01)  (1  cup  =  237  ml). However,  evidence  of  bias  toward
preferential publication of smaller studies that suggest protective effects urges caution in interpreting this result.
The geographic region where the studies were conducted appeared to explain much of the heterogeneity among
coronary heart disease, myocardial infarction, and probably stroke results. With increasing tea consumption, the
risk increased for coronary heart disease in the United Kingdom and for stroke in Australia, whereas the risk
decreased in other regions, particularly in continental Europe. Am J Epidemiol 2001;154:495–503.

cardiovascular diseases; cerebrovascular accident; coronary disease; meta-analysis; myocardial infarction; tea

Tea  is  the  second  most  common  drink  in  the  world.
Because of the high consumption of tea, even small effects
in persons could have a large impact on public health. The
polyphenolic flavonoids in tea are thought to have a protec-
tive effect on cardiovascular disease. Oxidized low density
lipoproteins occur in atherosclerotic plaques in the vascular
system and heart (1). Flavonoids have antioxidative proper-
ties  that  prevent  oxidation  of  low  density  lipoproteins  in
vitro  and,  as  recently  shown,  in  vivo  as  well  (2–6).  High
concentrations of autoantibodies against oxidized low den-
sity  lipoproteins  have  been  found  in  patients  with  athero-
sclerosis (7, 8). Nevertheless, the relevance of these labora-
tory findings for a hypothetically protective effect of tea on
cardiovascular  disease  remains  unknown.  Therefore,  the
goal of the present study was to analyze the estimated effect
of  tea  consumption  on  cardiovascular  disease  in  all  pub-
lished epidemiologic studies.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

To search for observational studies of tea consumption in
relation to cardiovascular disease, we conducted a literature

search in MEDLINE for papers published from January 1,
1966,  to  October  14,  2000.  The  keywords  for  the  search
were tea, coffee, caffeine, or flavonoids together with one of
the  following  outcomes:  cardiovascular  disease,  coronary
heart disease, stroke, myocardial infarction, ischemic heart
disease, cerebrovascular disease, or cardiovascular risk. We
included references listed in the recovered articles as well as
in  review  articles.  We  examined  all  observational  studies
directly, because some studies did not report results for tea
and  cardiovascular  disease  as  the  main  result  and  did  not
mention these results in the abstracts of the articles.

Four  reports  on  three  early  case-control  studies  (9–11)
were excluded because they did not include sufficient infor-
mation to compute an estimate of relative risk or its standard
error. (Throughout this paper, the term “relative risk” is used
for incidence rate ratios estimated directly in cohort studies
and by the exposure odds ratio in case-control studies.) In
addition,  two  cross-sectional  studies  that  measured  serum
levels  and  included  undiagnosed  cases  (12,  13)  were
excluded.  However,  data  from  the  latter  cohort  (13)  were
included as drawn from a separate publication (14). A report
by Klatsky et al. (15) was replaced by a more recent analy-
sis of the same cohort (16). In the report by Sato et al. (17),
results from the prospective part of the study were used. We
contacted the authors of 11 studies (14, 16–25) for informa-
tion not included in their papers, such as variance estimates,
numbers of subjects in categories of tea consumption, and
typical  tea  cup  sizes  in  specific  locales.  Nine  authors
responded to our request (see Acknowledgments).

The  studies  addressed  a  diversity  of  cardiovascular  dis-
eases  (International  Classification  of  Diseases,  Ninth

Revision, codes 390–459), which were combined in differ-
ent ways (appendix table 1). We included the three outcome
categories  (myocardial  infarction,  stroke,  and  the  broader
category of coronary heart disease), which were examined
in at least three studies. If a study provided more than one
effect estimate for a single outcome category (14, 16), only
one estimate was used.

The following paragraphs in this section pertain to statis-
tical methods. The statistical analyses included 1) extracting
or computing a common, comparable relative risk estimate
from  each  study;  2)  searching  for  evidence  of  publication
bias;  3)  analyzing  interstudy  variation;  and  4)  computing
summary effect estimates as indicated. Evidence of publica-
tion  bias  and  heterogeneity  was  taken  to  contraindicate
reliance on overall summaries (23). In the presence of het-
erogeneity of effect, the main purpose of the meta-analysis
became the identification of sources of interstudy variation.
We attempted to place the studies on a common footing by
estimating the relative risk of a 3 cups per day increase in tea
consumption  (e.g.,  from  no  tea  consumption  to  3  cups  per
day)  (1  cup  ⫽ 237  ml).  For  studies  reporting  relative  risk
estimates in categories of tea consumption, we used inverse
variance-weighted  categorical  regression  to  estimate  linear
exposure-response  curves.  These  analyses  were  conducted
on the incidence rate scale for cohort studies and on the logit
scale  for  case-control  studies. We  used  the  covariance-cor-
rected method of Greenland and Longnecker (26) for studies
that provided the relative risk of tea consumption for more
than two categories of tea consumption and provided the per-
son-time per number of all subjects and cases per category of
tea  consumption  (18,  20,  21,  25,  27–30).  For  other  studies
(14, 17, 19, 22, 23, 33, 34), we used the method described by
Berlin et al. (31) and Greeland (32) or the relative risk for tea
consumption as continuous (16, 24).

We assigned exposure values, in cups per day, to the tea
consumption  categories  in  the  original  studies  as  follows.
For case-control studies, we used the tea consumption of the
control  groups.  The  various  measures  of  tea  consumption
(cups,  grams,  milliliters)  were  transformed  to  a  common
measure  of  cups  per  day  (1  cup  ⫽ 8  ounces  ⫽ 237  ml).
When  category  medians  (14,  20)  or  means  (29,  33)  were
available, they were used. Category midranges were applied
for  the  remaining  closed-ended  categories  if  they  were  no
broader than 2 cups per day. If the highest, open-ended cat-
egory  included  no  more  than  20  percent  of  the  study  sub-
jects, we assigned that category a value equal to 1.2 times its
lower  boundary  (18,  21–23,  25,  27).  For  the  study  by
Stensvold  et  al.  (19),  more  detailed  data  from  an  earlier
report (35) on the same cohort were used to assign values to
the  tea  consumption  categories.  Some  of  the  closed-ended
categories were wider than 2 cups per day in the studies by
Rosenberg  et  al.  (30),  Jick  et  al.  (34),  and  the  Boston
Collaborative  Drug  Surveillance  Program  (28).  For  these
studies,  we  assigned  category  medians  from  the  National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey I Epidemiologic
Followup  Study  (36).  In  the  Japanese  study  by  Sato  et  al.
(17), 41 percent of the subjects were in the highest, open-
ended category. For this study, we used category midranges
for the closed-ended categories. We used the factor 1.4 times

the lower boundary of 7 cups per day for the highest, open-
ended category instead of 1.2, because we expected the dis-
tribution to be skewed to the right, given the large propor-
tion of people in the highest category.

The log-rank test of Begg and Mazumdar (37) was used
for evidence of publication bias, with low p values suggest-
ing the presence of bias. In addition, funnel graphs in which
the study-specific effect estimates are displayed in relation
to the reciprocals of their estimated variances were created
(38). In the absence of publication bias, these graphs resem-
ble a funnel with the estimates from the larger studies in the
center, flanked symmetrically on either side by the less pre-
cise estimates.

To  explore  sources  of  heterogeneity  among  the  studies,
we  performed  stratified  and  meta-regression  analyses  (32,
39). The meta-regressions were fit using inverse variance-
weighted, linear regression. The dependent variable was the
log  relative  risk,  and  the  independent  variables  were  the
study characteristics suspected of being sources of hetero-
geneity. After transformation back to the original ratio scale,
the meta-regressions estimate the ratio of the average rela-
tive risk estimates reported by studies with one characteris-
tic to the average estimates reported by studies with another
characteristic. In this way, these models quantify the degree
to  which  characteristics  of  the  studies  are  associated  with
their  results.  The  fit  of  the  meta-regression  models  was
checked by calculating the residual sum of squares (32).

We  examined  the  following  study  characteristics  in  the
stratified and meta-regression analyses: study design (cohort,
case-control); mortality or morbidity data; geographic region
(United  States,  United  Kingdom,  continental  Europe, Asia,
Australia);  gender;  adjustment  for  potential  confounders  by
modeling, restriction, or stratification (sex and/or age, socio-
economic  status,  smoking,  other  nondietary  risk  factors  for
cardiovascular  disease  including  alcohol,  dietary  factors);
publication year (before or during 1980, 1981–1990, during
or after 1991); age of subjects (<50 years, ≥50 years, all ages);
participation rate (among the controls in case-control studies
if separately reported); frequency of tea drinking in the study
population  (<50  percent,  ≥50  percent  drinking  ≥1cup  per
day); and years of follow-up (cohort studies only). We were
not able to investigate whether differences in dietary assess-
ment  methods  accounted  for  heterogeneity  because  of  the
lack of description of the dietary assessment methods applied.
Study  characteristics  were  initially  examined  one  by  one,
because of the lack of power to run them jointly due to the
small  number  of  studies. An  attempt  was  made  to  examine
jointly those characteristics that appeared in these analyses to
be appreciably associated with the study-specific effect esti-
mates.

To examine the effect of differences in the strength of tea
in  different  regions  quantitatively,  we  multiplied  the
assigned categorical dose by 0.5 and recalculated the sum-
marized  risk  estimate  for  studies  conducted  in  the  United
States  on  coronary  heat  disease  or  myocardial  infarction.
According to this calculation, we assume that the tea in the
United States is half as strong as that in Europe. All analy-
ses were conducted with Statistical Analysis System (SAS)
software (40).

RESULTS

We  identified  and  included  10  cohort  studies  and  seven
case-control studies (table 1, Appendix). Most studies sug-
gested a decrease in the rate of cardiovascular disease out-
comes with increasing tea consumption. Results from coro-
nary  heart  disease  or  myocardial  infarction  are  shown  in
figure 1. Two studies from the United Kingdom (14, 27) and
two  studies  from  the  United  States  (21,  23)  indicated  an
increased risk with increasing tea consumption, whereas the
other studies indicated a decrease in risk. In table 1, the risk
estimates were standardized for measuring the effects per 3
cups of tea per day. In the four studies showing an increased
risk of coronary heart disease or myocardial infarction, the
risk increased by 4–126 percent with each 3 cups/day (14,
21, 23, 27). In the other studies on coronary heart disease or
myocardial infarction, the risk decreased between 1 and 75
percent per each 3 cups/day. For stroke, one of six studies
showed an increased risk of 51 percent with each 3 cups/day
(25), whereas the other studies indicated a decrease in risk
of 26–66 percent with each increment of 3 cups per day.

The analyses of publication bias are summarized in figure
2. The small numbers of studies limit the interpretation, but
the funnel graphs and the Begg-Mazumdar test both suggest
the  presence  of  publication  bias  for  myocardial  infarction
and  particularly  for  stroke.  Specifically,  it  appears  that
smaller  studies  producing  results  inconsistent  with  the
hypothesis of a preventive effect for myocardial infarction
may have a very low probability of becoming published.

Does Tea Affect Cardiovascular Disease? 497

The  results  for  cardiovascular  disease  categories  were
very  heterogeneous  (p <  0.02).  The  characteristic  most
strongly associated with the study-specific effect estimates
was geographic region (table 2). Studies on coronary heart
disease and myocardial infarction conducted in continental
Europe reported much stronger inverse associations than did
studies  conducted  elsewhere.  On  average,  the  relative  risk
estimates from continental Europe were about one third to
one fourth of the magnitude of the estimates from the United
States, with the exception of the two studies (14, 27) in the
United Kingdom that reported a moderately strong positive
association between tea intake and coronary heart disease.
Neither the basic study design nor any other characteristic of
the studies mentioned appeared to explain the heterogeneity
of  their  results  for  coronary  heart  disease  or  myocardial
infarction to any appreciable degree.

For studies on stroke, the follow-up time in cohort studies
appeared  to  explain  the  heterogeneity  among  the  studies.
With  each  year  of  follow-up  time  the  risk  estimates
decreased by 5 percent. In addition, the geographic region or
study design explained heterogeneity. Because the one study
from Australia  showing  a  very  different  effect  (increasing
risk with increasing tea consumption) from the other studies
from other geographic regions is also the only case-control
study, it is not possible to determine if the geographic region
or the study design explained heterogeneity.

The test for heterogeneity of the effect of tea on myocar-
dial infarction showed no strong evidence of heterogeneity
(p ⫽ 0.20) (table 3). The fixed-effects summary suggests a

associated with an increment of 3 cups of tea per day (sum-
mary  relative  risk  ⫽ 0.89,  95  percent  confidence  interval:
0.79, 1.01) (table 3). The evidence of publication bias, how-
ever, urges caution in interpreting this result.

Results stratified by region and study design are shown
in  table  3.  For  the  broader  outcome  in  which  myocardial
infarction  is  considered  together  with  coronary  heart  dis-
ease,  the  results  from  the  three  studies  in  continental
Europe are homogeneous (p ⫽ 0.95) and suggest that drink-
ing an additional 3 cups of tea per day can reduce incidence
by  two  thirds,  an  immense  preventive  effect.  The  eight
studies  conducted  in  the  United  States  were  less  homo-
geneous (p ⫽ 0. 30) with a beneficial effect, if any, being a
reduction in incidence of only about 5 percent for each 3
cups/day. An increasing risk with increasing tea consump-
tion  was  indicated  for  the  two  studies  from  the  United
Kingdom  on  coronary  heart  disease. These  estimates  also
did  not  indicate  strong  evidence  of  heterogeneity  (p ⫽
0.30) with an increase in risk of 62 percent with each incre-
ment of 3 cups/day.

Additionally, we calculated the summarized risk estimate
for studies conducted in the United States on coronary heart
disease  or  myocardial  infarction,  assuming  that  tea  in  the
United States is half as strong as that in Europe. In this case,
the  summarized  risk  estimate  for  studies  conducted  in  the
United States for coronary heart disease or myocardial infarc-
tion is 0.90 (95 percent confidence interval: 0.81, 1.01) with
each increment of 3 cups/day rather than 0.95 (table 3).

The geographic stratified risk estimates of coronary heart
disease  alone  were  fairly  similar  to  the  risk  estimates  of
coronary heart disease or myocardial infarction combined,
although  the  results  of  the  three  studies  from  the  United
States were too heterogeneous (p ⫽ 0.16) to be summarized.
For myocardial infarction, the effect estimates from stud-
ies in the United States were reasonably homogeneous and
suggested  little  or  no  effect.  The  fixed-effects  summary
from  these  six  studies  from  the  United  States  was  almost
identical to the estimate from the one study from Italy that
was included (relative risk ⫽ 0.89 vs. relative risk ⫽ 0.91).

the United States, continental Europe, or Asia did not indi-
cate strong evidence of heterogeneity (p ⫽ 0.21) with a sig-
nificant  reduction  in  stroke  incidence  of  12  percent  per  3
cups  of  tea/day.  The  protective  effect  of  tea  on  stroke
increased in cohort studies by 5 percent with each year of
follow-up (4–15 years).

DISCUSSION

The main purpose of this study was to examine the pub-
lished literature on tea consumption and cardiovascular dis-
ease  for  evidence  of  publication  bias  and  heterogeneity  of
effect  and  to  summarize  the  effect  estimates  as  indicated.
Evidence of publication bias in the literature was apparent
for  myocardial  infarction  and  particularly  for  stroke.  The
relative  risk  estimates  for  studies  of  myocardial  infarction
appeared  homogeneous  overall,  although  publication  bias
urges caution in interpreting this result. For coronary heart
disease  or  myocardial  infarction  other  than  geographic
region, no characteristic of the studies appeared to explain
the  heterogeneity  or  to  be  strongly  associated  with  the
study-specific  results.  Three  studies  from  continental
Europe  were  consistent  in  suggesting  a  strong  preventive

Am J Epidemiol Vol. 154, No. 6, 2001

effect,  whereas  eight  studies  from  the  United  States  were
consistent in suggesting little or no effect for coronary heart
disease or myocardial infarction. Heterogeneity of risk esti-
mates for stroke could be explained by length of follow-up
together with study design and/or geographic region. Cohort
studies not conducted in Australia indicated a decreased risk
of  stroke  with  increasing  tea  consumption.  However,  evi-
dence of publication bias suggests extreme caution in inter-
pretation of these data.

The  small  number  of  published  studies  for  any  specific
cardiovascular disease outcome severely limited the ability
to detect publication bias or heterogeneity. Tests of homo-
geneity  are  well  known  to  have  low  power.  Begg  and
Mazumdar (37) stated that their test for publication bias has
moderate  power  with  25  studies  and  high  power  with  75
studies. It is impressive, therefore, that the p values from the
tests for heterogeneity and publication bias were so low for
stroke, despite the small number of studies in the published
literature on the topic at hand. It would be of considerable
interest to learn if epidemiologic researchers have examined
results  for  tea  and  myocardial  infarction  and  stroke  and
refrained  from  publishing  them  because  they  were  not
indicative  of  pronounced  preventive  effects.  Only  one  of
many possibilities is that publication bias on this question

has been stronger in Europe, where more people drink tea,
than in the United States.

If  studies  with  positive  associations  have  not  been  pub-
lished, as suggested by the tests of publication bias and fun-
nel graphs, the central tendency would be closer to the null
value.  One  cannot  predict  what  the  stratified  and  meta-
regression analysis of study characteristics would show if a
sizable number of unpublished studies were brought to light.
The  evidence  of  publication  bias  did  not  disprove  the
hypothesis  of  a  protective  effect,  but  it  tempered  the
strengths of the conclusion regarding preventive potential.
The  outcomes  investigated  in  the  studies  had  different
definitions and were combined in more or less broad cate-
gories.  If  tea  has  different  effects  on  different  aspects  of 
cardiovascular diseases, a combined estimate from various
outcomes may minimize a tea effect. The results of the pres-
ent meta-analysis suggest this possibility because the study
results  were  less  heterogeneous  for  myocardial  infarction
alone than for any less specific outcome. These results sug-
gest  that  a  more  precise  definition  of  the  outcome  might
improve the homogeneity among studies and the precision
in the effect estimate.

Case-control  studies  tend  to  have  a  higher  potential  for
recall and selection bias. Nevertheless, we saw little or no
difference in results between cohort studies and case-control
studies for coronary heart disease or myocardial infarction.
For stroke, it remains unclear if the differences were due to
regional differences or differences in study design. The low
number  of  studies  limited  the  power  to  detect  differences
among  the  studies.  If  we  expected  the  differences  to  be
small,  as  possibly  for  differences  in  adjustment  for  con-
founding, we have limited ability to detect small differences
in the meta-analysis.

For cohort studies on stroke, we found an increased pro-
tective effect with increasing length of follow-up between 4
and 15 years, which might indicate the importance of early
prevention.

The findings from the United Kingdom and Australia of a
positive association were unique. One possible explanation
involves  the  polyphenolic  antioxidant  flavonoids  hypothe-
sized to be one mechanism by which tea might reduce car-
diovascular  disease  incidence  (1–7).  In  the  United
Kingdom, milk commonly is added to tea. Hertog et al. (27)
reported  that  more  than  99  percent  of  tea  drinkers  added
milk and argued that this difference might explain why they
did not find evidence of a protective effect of tea. Hasalam
(41) showed that flavonoids are bound to protein. Further,
indirect evidence suggested by Serafini et al. (42) showed
that adding milk to tea abolished its in vivo plasma antioxi-
dant  potential.  In  contrast  to  these  findings,  however,
Hollman et al. (43) and van het Hof et al. (44) did not find
different flavonoid plasma concentrations in subjects given
tea with or without milk. The hypothesis has been stated for
the findings from the United Kingdom studies on coronary
heart  disease.  This  is  also  a  possible  explanation  for  the
findings for stroke in Australia, a population that is strongly
influenced by immigrants from the United Kingdom. In any
event, the hypothesis of Hertog et al. (27) and Hasalam (41)
might explain why an inverse association would not be seen
in  the  United  Kingdom  and Australia,  but  that  hypothesis
would not explain why a positive association was seen. The
amount of fat in the milk that is added to the tea would seem
woefully insufficient to increase cardiovascular disease risk.
Sesso  et  al.  (20)  suggested  that  higher  tea  consumption
might be a surrogate for a healthier lifestyle. Weak inverse
associations  of  tea  consumption  with  smoking,  body  mass
index, and dietary risk factors have been reported (16, 19,
29). Residual confounding and lack of control for lifestyle
factors might explain why some studies appear to suggest a
protective  effect  of  tea  on  cardiovascular  disease.  These
problems  may  also  explain  regional  differences.  In  the
United  Kingdom  and  in  continental  Europe,  tea  consump-
tion is very common and therefore may not be restricted to
people with healthier behaviors. Perhaps residual confound-
ing  and  lack  of  control  for  lifestyle  factors  are  especially
pronounced in the United States, where fewer people drink
tea and where weaker associations between tea and cardio-
vascular disease have been reported.

An important limitation of the studies was imprecision of
the  exposure  measurement.  Only  the  study  from  Japan
investigated green tea. All other studies referred simply to

It  is  to  be  expected  that  study  subjects  give  a  summary
answer for any kind of tea if they are asked only about their
tea consumption without more detailed questions. Different
kinds  of  tea  differ  in  the  kind  and  quantity  of  substances
and,  even  within  the  same  kind  of  tea,  differences  exist.
According to the analysis of Prior and Cao (45), the phenol
content and antioxidant capacity of black, green, and herbal
or  berry  teas  can  vary  more  than  twofold. The  mean  total
phenol content of black tea is 129.3 mg/g, of green tea, 71.7
mg/g,  and  of  herbal/berry  tea,  51.7  mg/g.  In  addition,  the
method of preparation affects the content of tea.

The information available was insufficient for us to address
the kinds of tea, the methods of preparation, or the differences
in  tea  strength.  These  factors  might  help  to  explain  the
regional differences we found, however. For instance, it might
be expected that the kind of tea, method of preparation, and
preference of tea strength differ among the regions and that
there might be more similarity within a region than between
regions. It is likely that the varying characteristics of tea have
different  effects  on  cardiovascular  disease.  If,  for  instance,
Europeans tend to drink stronger tea than North Americans
do, the effect per cup of tea could be higher in the European

Am J Epidemiol Vol. 154, No. 6, 2001

studies.  We  examined  this  hypothesis  by  recalculating  the
summarized  risk  estimate  for  coronary  heart  disease  or
myocardial  infarction  in  the  way  that  the  tea  in  the  United
States is assumed to be only half as strong as that in Europe.
In  this  case,  the  risk  estimate  for  studies  conducted  in  the
United States decreased only from 0.95 to 0.90 with each 3
cups/day and is still very different from the summarized risk
estimate in continental Europe of 0.27. It appears, therefore,
that differences in tea strength may explain only a small frac-
tion of the regional differences.

Because of the high consumption and distribution of tea
worldwide,  hypothetical  health  effects  of  tea  are  important
public  health  issues.  It  appears  worthwhile  to  address  the
regional differences in future research, while improving con-
trol for potential confounders and measurement of the many
characteristics of tea and its preparation and consumption. Of
greatest  and  most  immediate  importance  would  be  for  all
investigators who have unpublished results on tea and car-
diovascular disease to bring those results forward.

Soda consumption and the risk of stroke in men and women1–3

Adam M Bernstein, Lawrence de Koning, Alan J Flint, Kathryn M Rexrode, and Walter C Willett

ABSTRACT
Background: Consumption of sugar-sweetened soda has been as-
sociated with an increased risk of cardiometabolic disease. The re-
lation with cerebrovascular disease has not yet been closely
examined.
Objective: Our objective was to examine patterns of soda consump-
tion and substitution of alternative beverages for soda in relation to
stroke risk.
Design: The Nurses’ Health Study, a prospective cohort study of
84,085 women followed for 28 y (1980–2008), and the Health Pro-
fessionals Follow-Up Study, a prospective cohort study of 43,371
men followed for 22 y (1986–2008), provided data on soda con-
sumption and incident stroke.
Results: We documented 1416 strokes in men during 841,770 per-
son-years of follow-up and 2938 strokes in women during 2,188,230
person-years of follow-up. The pooled RR of total stroke for 1
serving of sugar-sweetened soda/d, compared with none, was 1.16
(95% CI: 1.00, 1.34). The pooled RR of total stroke for 1 serving
of low-calorie soda/d, compared with none, was 1.16 (95% CI: 1.05,
1.28). Compared with 1 serving of sugar-sweetened soda/d, 1 serv-
ing of decaffeinated coffee/d was associated with a 10% (95% CI:
1%, 19%) lower risk of stroke and 1 serving of caffeinated coffee/
d with a 9% (95% CI: 0%, 17%) lower risk. Similar estimated
reductions in risk were seen for substitution of caffeinated or de-
caffeinated coffee for low-calorie soda.
Conclusions: Greater consumption of sugar-sweetened and low-
calorie sodas was associated with a signiﬁcantly higher risk of
stroke. This risk may be reduced by substituting alternative bever-
ages for soda.

Am J Clin Nutr 2012;95:1190–9.

INTRODUCTION

Consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages, including sodas,
vitamin water, and energy drinks, has increased in the United
States over the past 3 decades. Per capita consumption in 2009
was estimated at 45 gallons/y, or nearly half of the total beverage
intake (1). Sodas, or carbonated soft drinks, are consumed more
than any other sugar-sweetened beverage and, despite a recent
report that intake of sugar-sweetened soda in the United States
may be declining, soda remains the largest source of added sugar
in the diet (2).

Sugar-sweetened beverages have been linked with weight
gain, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, gout, and coronary
artery disease (CAD)4 (3–7). The associations with cardiome-
tabolic disease appear to be independent of BMI and energy intake,
which suggests that other mechanisms, such as hyperglycemia,
dyslipidemia, inﬂammation, or endothelial dysfunction, underlie
the association (6). Low-calorie sodas are less-well studied than

are sugar-sweetened sodas. Although intake of these beverages
was recently linked with the metabolic syndrome, reverse cau-
sality or residual confounding could explain the association (8),
and a recent prospective study found no association between
low-calorie soda intake and diabetes risk (9). Intake of low-
calorie soda has been associated with progression of kidney
disease (10).

Given the associations between soda consumption, car-
diometabolic risk factors, and CAD, we sought to evaluate the
relation between sodas and stroke risk. This relation has not been
closely examined, yet stroke remains a signiﬁcant cause of
morbidity, mortality, and health care expenditures in the United
States (11, 12) and shares many of the same risk factors as CAD
(13). We therefore examined patterns of soda consumption and
the substitution of alternative beverages for soda in relation to
stroke risk in 2 large prospective cohorts of men and women.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS

Study populations

The Nurses’ Health Study (NHS) began in 1976, when 121,700
female registered nurses aged 30–55 y residing in the United
States provided information on their medical history and lifestyle.
The Health Professionals Follow-Up Study (HPFS) began in
1986, when 51,529 male dentists, pharmacists, optometrists,
osteopaths, podiatrists, and veterinarians aged 40–75 y and re-
siding in the United States provided information on their medical
history and lifestyle. Every 2 y, follow-up questionnaires have
been sent to both populations to update their information. In

SODA AND STROKE RISK

1191

1980, a 61-item food-frequency questionnaire (FFQ) was in-
cluded to assess intake of speciﬁc foods in the NHS. Expanded
questionnaires updated dietary intake in 1986, 1990, 1994, 1998,
2002, and 2006. In 1986, a 131-item FFQ assessed intake of
speciﬁc foods in the HPFS, and similar questionnaires were used
to update dietary intake in 1990, 1994, 1998, 2002, and 2006. As
in our previous analyses, we excluded participants who left
excessive items blank on their baseline FFQ, those who reported
implausibly low or high energy intakes, and those with previously
diagnosed cancer, diabetes, angina, myocardial infarction, stroke,
or other cardiovascular disease [including a history of percuta-
neous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass
grafting (CABG)] (14–18). The ﬁnal 1980 baseline population
consisted of 84,085 women, and the ﬁnal 1986 baseline pop-
ulation consisted of 43,371 men. This study was approved by the
Committee on the use of Human Subjects in Research at Brigham
and Women’s Hospital. Return of a questionnaire was considered
to imply consent.

Assessment of soda intake

The types of sodas on the FFQs included low-calorie cola with
caffeine (eg, Diet Coke, Tab with caffeine), low-calorie cola
without caffeine (eg, Pepsi Free), other low-calorie carbonated
beverages (eg, Diet 7-Up, Fresca, Diet Mountain Dew, diet ginger
ale), sugar-sweetened cola with caffeine (eg, Coke, Pepsi), sugar-
sweetened cola without caffeine (eg, caffeine-free Coke, caffeine-
free Pepsi), and other carbonated beverages with sugar (eg, 7-Up,
Mountain Dew, Surge, Dr Pepper). We categorized soda as sugar-
sweetened or low-calorie (diet or artiﬁcially sweetened). Colas
are a type of soda, or carbonated soft drink, originally made with
kola nuts to add caffeine. To calculate each participant’s soda
intake, the participant was asked how often on average during the
previous year he or she had consumed one glass, bottle, or can.
Nine responses were possible, ranging from “never or almost
never” to “more than 6 times per day.” The reproducibility and
validity of the FFQs in measuring beverage intake were pre-
viously described (19–23): the Pearson correlation coefﬁcient,
corrected for within-person variation, between the FFQ and di-
etary records was previously reported as 0.84 for cola and 0.36–
0.40 for noncola soda (21).

Ascertainment of incident stroke cases

The primary endpoint for this study was incident stroke oc-
curring after the return of the 1980 FFQ but before 1 June 2008 in
the NHS and after the return of the 1986 FFQ but before 31
January 2008 in the HPFS. After report of a stroke, permission to
obtain medical records was requested, and these were reviewed
by study physicians with no knowledge of the subjects’ self-
reported risk factor status. Stroke was classiﬁed as ischemic
(thrombotic, embolic, or nonhemorrhagic), hemorrhagic (intra-
parenchymal hemorrhage or subarachnoid hemorrhage), or of
unknown type, as per criteria in the National Survey of Stroke
(24). Nonfatal strokes for which conﬁrmatory information was
obtained by interview or letter but no medical records and no
neuro-imaging (computerized tomography or magnetic reso-
nance imaging) were available, were designated as probable [225
of 1111 (or 20%) of cases in men and 737 of 2379 (or 31%) of
cases in women]. Deaths were identiﬁed from state vital records

or the National Death Index or were reported by next of kin or the
postal system. Follow-up for deaths was shown to be .98%
complete (25). Stroke was conﬁrmed as fatal only if conﬁrmed
by medical records or autopsy report. Fatal stroke was desig-
nated as probable if stroke was reported on the death certiﬁcate
or reported by next of kin, but no medical records were avail-
able. These cases constituted 98 of 305 (or 32%) cases in men
and 236 of 560 (or 42%) cases in women. We included all
conﬁrmed and probable cases in our report because results were
similar after probable cases were excluded.

Statistical analysis

We ﬁrst assessed whether a report of intermediate outcomes
(diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia,
angina, or
CABG/PCI), myocardial infarction, or cancer were associated
with a subsequent change in sugar-sweetened or low-calorie soda
intake (see online supplementary material under “Supplemental
data” in the online issue). These associations were weak; thus,
these diagnoses could not be important time-dependent con-
founders. Therefore, to avoid misclassiﬁcation of participants’
long-term soda intake, we continued updating each participant’s
intake throughout follow-up using data from all repeated FFQs.
To reduce within-person variation and best represent long-term
diet, participants were divided into categories of cumulative
average intake of sugar-sweetened and low-calorie soda con-
sumption. The categories included none, up to once per week,
once per week up to once per day, and once per day or more.
Cumulative averages were calculated by taking the mean of all
reported FFQ intakes up to the beginning of a follow-up interval.
The cumulative average intake was then associated with stroke
incidence from the time of the last returned questionnaire until
the next follow-up cycle. If dietary data from a particular FFQ
was missing, then that cycle’s cumulative average was the last
cumulative average carried forward.

We evaluated the associations between sugar-sweetened and
low-calorie soda consumption and total stroke incidence (is-
chemic,
intraparenchymal hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemor-
rhage, and unknown type) and the incidence of hemorrhagic and
ischemic strokes. Because the American Heart Association and
American Stroke Association have developed guidelines for the
primary prevention of stroke (inclusive of both ischemic and
hemorrhagic subtypes), and because of the recognized overlap of
risk factors and prevention strategies, we evaluated the associ-
ation between soda consumption and total stroke (26). In the
NHS, person-years of follow-up were calculated from the return
of the 1980 FFQ to the date of the ﬁrst stroke event, death, or 1
June 2008, whichever came ﬁrst. In the HPFS, person-years of
follow-up were calculated from the return of the 1986 FFQ to the
date of the ﬁrst stroke event, death, or 31 January 2008,
whichever came ﬁrst. The RR was computed by using a multi-
variable Cox proportional hazards regression model, with the
incidence rate in a speciﬁc category of cumulative average soda
intake divided by that in the lowest category (none). All models
were mutually adjusted for the other beverage type; ie, the sugar-
sweetened soda analysis adjusted for low-calorie soda and vice
versa. The ﬁrst multivariate model was stratiﬁed on age (mo) and
calendar time (2-y time intervals) and included red meat, poultry,
ﬁsh, whole-fat dairy products, low-fat dairy products, and nuts
(all in servings/d) and simultaneously controlled for intakes of

cereal ﬁber (g/d), alcohol (g/d), fruit and vegetable intake
(servings/d), and trans unsaturated fatty acids (g/d) and other
potential nondietary confounding variables. These variables
were updated biennially and included physical exercise (,3, 3
to ,9, 9 to ,18, 18 to ,27, or 27 metabolic equivalent tasks/
wk), cigarette smoking [never, past, or current (1–14, 15–24, or
25 cigarettes/d)], menopausal status in women (premenopausal,
postmenopausal with no history of hormone replacement, post-
menopausal with a history of hormone replacement, or post-
menopausal with current hormone replacement), parental history
of early myocardial infarction (before age 60 y), years of multi-
vitamin use, vitamin E supplement use (yes or no), and aspirin use
at least once per week (yes or no). The last value was carried
forward for one 2-y cycle to replace missing values. If partici-
pants left excessive items blank on a follow-up questionnaire, or
reported implausibly high or low energy intakes, they were con-
sidered to be missing data from that particular questionnaire, and
their most recent value (of physical exercise, for instance) was
carried forward. If the last value was missing, a missing value
indicator was created. The median value for each category of
intake was used to test for a linear trend across categories.
Neither a diagnosis of diabetes, angina, hypertension, hyper-
cholesterolemia, CABG/PCI, or myocardial infarction nor the
use of the medications prescribed to treat these diseases (in-
cluding statins and b-blockers) was included, because all of
these may be considered intermediate outcomes on the causal
pathway between diet and stroke. In a second multivariate
model, we included the above covariates as well as total energy
(kcal) and BMI (in kg/m2; ,22, 22–24, 24–25, 25–27, 27–29,
29–30, 30–32, 32–35, 35–40, or .40), both of which may be
considered either confounders or intermediates on the causal
pathway between soda consumption and stroke. RRs and SEs
for each category of intake from each cohort were then pooled
in ﬁxed-effects models to arrive at summary estimates as the Q
statistic P value for between-study heterogeneity was not sta-
tistically signiﬁcant (null hypothesis is that there is no het-
erogeneity between the HPFS and the NHS). To estimate the
absolute risk of total stroke by category of soda intake, we
multiplied the multivariable RRs by the incidence rates in the
referent groups (cases/per 100,000 person-years) (27).

In sensitivity analyses, to assess whether metabolic changes
related to excess body weight before the onset of cohort follow-
up inﬂuenced potential low-calorie soda–stroke associations, we
adjusted our multivariate models for weight change (increase or
decrease) in the 5 y before 1986 for men and in the 4 y before
1980 for women. We evaluated the relation between soda intake
and subarachnoid hemorrhage in a multivariate model. To evaluate
whether a soda-stroke association was mediated or confounded by
the presence of hypertension or diabetes, we adjusted our multi-
variate models for these diseases. Separately, we stratiﬁed our
multivariate model on the presence of diabetes (yes or no) or
hypertension (yes or no) to assess for effect modiﬁcation of soda
intake by one of these diagnoses. We tested the signiﬁcance of the
interaction with a likelihood ratio test by comparing a model with
the interaction terms to a model with only the main effects.

We also estimated the RR of stroke associated with substituting
caffeinated coffee, decaffeinated coffee, water, tea, skim milk, or
orange juice for either sugar-sweetened or low-calorie soda. To do
so, we ﬁt multivariable Cox proportional hazards models, which
included the covariates from our multivariable model with energy

intake and BMI, plus the above beverages entered as continuous
variables rather than as categorical variables (cumulative av-
erage servings/d). The cumulative average intakes of caffein-
ated coffee, decaffeinated coffee, water, tea, skim milk, or
orange juice were calculated in the same way as for soda.
Decaffeinated coffee was ﬁrst asked about in the NHS in 1984,
and water was ﬁrst asked about in 1986. The difference in the
coefﬁcients of 2 beverages, plus their covariance, was used to
estimate the RR and variance for the substitution (28, 29). RRs
and variances for each substitution from each cohort were then
pooled in ﬁxed-effects models to arrive at a summary estimate
of the effect of substituting one beverage for another in relation
to total stroke risk. All P values are 2-sided, with P values
,0.05 considered statistically signiﬁcant.

RESULTS

Cohort characteristics

During 2,188,230 person-years of follow-up from 1980 through
2008 in the NHS and during 841,770 person-years of follow-up
from 1986 through 2008 in the HPFS, we documented 2938 strokes
in women (1513 ischemic, 267 intraparenchymal hemorrhages,
252 subarachnoid hemorrhages, and 906 unspeciﬁed) and 1416
strokes in men (843 ischemic, 163 intraparenchymal hemorrhages,
54 subarachnoid hemorrhages, and 356 unspeciﬁed). Our follow-
up rate through 2006 (deﬁned as person-years contributed by study
participants until their last returned FFQ or death divided by
person-years contributed by study participants until death) was
96% in men and 97% in women. Characteristics of the study
participants during follow-up, averaged according to the pro-
portion of person-time in each category of soda intake, are shown
in Tables 1 and 2. Compared with men and women who did not
consume sugar-sweetened soda, those who consumed 1 serving/
d had higher rates of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia and
lower physical activity. More frequent consumption of sugar-
sweetened soda was associated with more frequent consumption
of red meat and whole-fat dairy products. A higher consumption
of low-calorie soda consumption was also associated with higher
rates of chronic disease and a higher BMI.

Soda intake and total incident stroke

In multivariable analyses adjusted for dietary and nondietary
cardiovascular disease risk factors, higher intakes of both sugar-
sweetened and low-calorie soda were associated with a higher
risk of overall stroke (Table 3). In men, 1 serving sugar-
sweetened soda/d, compared with none, was associated with
a statistically nonsigniﬁcant RR of total stroke of 1.08 (95% CI:
0.82, 1.41); in women, the statistically signiﬁcant RR was 1.19
(95% CI: 1.00, 1.42). These risks corresponded to absolute risk
differences of 14 and 24 cases/100,000 person-years. In men,
1 serving low-calorie soda/d, compared with none, was asso-
ciated with an RR of total stroke of 1.10 (95% CI: 0.92, 1.32); in
women, it was 1.18 (95% CI: 1.05, 1.33). These RRs corre-
sponded to absolute risk differences of 17 and 21 cases/100,000
person-years. Pooled multivariable risk of stroke among men
and women was 1.12 (95% CI: 1.02, 1.24) for 1 serving sugar-
sweetened soda/d and 1.09 (95% CI: 1.04, 1.15) for 1 serving
low-calorie soda. Risk of stroke with consumption of either
sugar-sweetened or low-calorie soda was greater in women than
in men, but the results of formal tests of heterogeneity comparing the

(all in quintiles of servings/d); cereal ﬁber (quintiles of g/d); alcohol intake (quintiles of g/d); trans fat intake (quintiles of g/d); cigarette smoking [never, past, or

consumption and stroke risk in men, but did not materially change
the associations in women or with sugar-sweetened beverages.

Soda intake and ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke
In women, greater consumption of sugar-sweetened soda was
associated with a higher risk of ischemic stroke (RR per 1

serving/d: 1.19; 95% CI: 1.01, 1.39), whereas greater con-
sumption of low-calorie soda was associated with a greater risk
of hemorrhagic stroke (RR per 1 serving/d: 1.31; 95% CI:
1.15, 1.51) (Table 4). There were only 8 cases of hemorrhagic
stroke among men with a cumulative average intake of sugar-
sweetened soda of once per day or more (Table 4). The asso-
ciation between low-calorie soda and hemorrhagic stroke risk
remained when results for men and women were pooled
(RR per 1 serving/d: 1.27; 95% CI: 1.12, 1.43). Given the
potential for unstable estimates from the few cases in men,

a multivariate model including BMI and energy intake, we
observed that a greater intake of low-calorie soda was asso-
ciated with a signiﬁcantly higher risk of subarachnoid hem-
orrhage (RR per 1 serving/d: 1.37; 95% CI: 1.13, 1.65),
whereas sugar-sweetened soda was not (RR per 1 serving/d:
0.89; 95% CI: 0.62, 1.89).

Risk modiﬁcation by diabetes and hypertension

Controlling for hypertension and diabetes during follow-up
in multivariate models each attenuated our results. The asso-
ciations were further attenuated when controlled for both: the
RRs of stroke in women across quartiles of sugar-sweetened
soda intake were 1.00, 1.00, 1.09, and 1.14 (P-trend = 0.08) and
across quartiles of low-calorie soda intake were 1.00, 0.99,
1.06, and 1.11 (P-trend = 0.07); the RRs in men across quar-
tiles of sugar-sweetened soda intake were 1.00, 0.93, 0.99, and
1.05 (P-trend = 0.52) and across quartiles of low-calorie soda
intake were 1.00, 0.91, 0.99, and 1.03 (P-trend = 0.42) (see

supplementary Table 1 under “Supplemental data” in the on-
line issue). We did not observe a signiﬁcant interaction be-
tween sugar-sweetened or low-calorie soda intake and a history
of either diabetes or hypertension (see supplementary Tables 2
and 3 under “Supplemental data” in the online issue).

Substitution of alternative beverages for soda with stroke
risk

Compared with 1 serving of sugar-sweetened or low-calorie
soda per day, 1 serving of either caffeinated or decaffeinated
coffee per day was associated with a signiﬁcantly lower risk of
stroke (Figure 1, A and B). When compared with 1 serving
sugar-sweetened soda/d, 1 serving decaffeinated coffee/d was
associated with a 10% (95% CI: 1%, 19%) lower risk of stroke
and 1 serving caffeinated coffee/d with a 9% (95% CI: 0%,
17%) lower risk. When compared with 1 serving low-calorie
soda/d, 1 serving decaffeinated coffee/d was associated with
a 13% (7%, 18%) lower risk of stroke and 1 serving caffeinated
coffee/d with an 11% (95% CI: 7%, 16%) lower risk. Skim milk
was associated with an 11% (95% CI: 5%, 16%) lower risk
when substituted for low-calorie soda. When substituted for

FIGURE 1. Pooled RRs and 95% CIs associated with substitution of alternative beverages for sugar-sweetened soda (A) and low-calorie soda (B) among
43,371 men and 84,085 women (1 serving/d). RRs and variances for each substitution from each cohort were derived from a Cox proportional hazards
multivariate model and then pooled in a ﬁxed-effects model to arrive at a summary estimate of the effect of substituting one beverage for another in relation to
total stroke risk; the Q statistic P value for between-study heterogeneity (null hypothesis is that there is no heterogeneity between Health Professionals Follow-
Up Study and Nurses’ Health Study) for estimate of effect of substitutions is .0.05.

sugar-sweetened or low-calorie soda, tea and orange juice were
associated with a trend toward reduced risk.

intake and hypertension, which suggests that constituents in soda
other than caffeine affect blood pressure (34).

DISCUSSION

In these large prospective cohort studies of men and women,
we observed that a higher consumption of sugar-sweetened and
low-calorie sodas was associated with a higher risk of stroke. The
risks appeared higher in women than in men. The associations
were independent of established dietary and nondietary cardio-
vascular disease risk factors, including BMI and energy intake.
Multiple mechanisms may explain these ﬁndings. In sugar-
sweetened sodas, the sugar load may lead to rapid increases in
blood glucose and insulin, which over time lead to glucose in-
tolerance, insulin resistance, and inﬂammation; these physiologic
changes in turn inﬂuence atherosclerosis, plaque stability, and
thrombosis—a risk factor for ischemic stroke (3). Fructose can be
converted to visceral and hepatic fat (30) and enhances lipo-
genesis and triglyceride synthesis (31). Fructose can also increase
serum uric acid, which can reduce endothelial nitric oxide and
increase blood pressure—a risk factor for ischemic and hem-
orrhagic stroke (32). Because intake of sugar-sweetened bever-
ages is not regulated by the body in the same manner as foods,
their consumption may lead to excess caloric intake (33);
however, this mechanism is unlikely to explain our ﬁndings
because control for energy intake in our models did not alter our
results. The caramel coloring in sugar-sweetened and low-calorie
colas has advanced-glycation end products, which have been
linked with inﬂammation, and which in turn has been linked with
the initiation, growth, and destabilization of atherosclerotic le-
sions (3, 26). Whereas an inverse U-shaped association has been
reported between caffeine intake and incident hypertension,
a linear association has been reported between increasing soda

In comparison with soda, coffee contains chlorogenic acids,
lignans, and magnesium, which act as antioxidants and mediators
of glucose metabolism and may reduce stroke risk (35). Higher
intakes of potassium, magnesium, and calcium have been as-
sociated with a reduced stroke risk (36): one or more of these
nutrients may help explain the reduction in risk seen when skim
milk or orange juice is substituted for soda. Although a modest
beneﬁt with substitution of water for soda cannot be excluded
because the CI for the substitution includes a modest beneﬁt, the
signiﬁcant substitutions for soda were with beverages that appear
to have inherently positive beneﬁts for stroke reduction.

We did not observe a strong association between a diagnosis of
hypertension or diabetes and a subsequent change in soda intake.
We also did not ﬁnd a signiﬁcant interaction between soda intake
and hypertension or diabetes. However, when we controlled for
these diagnoses in our multivariate model, the strength of the
associations between both sugar-sweetened and low-calorie soda
intakes and stroke risk was attenuated. These ﬁndings suggest
that hypertension and diabetes may be intermediates, rather than
confounders or effect-modiﬁers, of the soda-stroke association.
Our work builds on previous research on the relation between
sugar-sweetened beverages and incident chronic disease. Other
studies have evaluated the relation between soda consumption
and metabolic disorders (3, 4, 9, 37–39), yet few have examined
soda consumption and incident cardiovascular disease (6, 40, 41).
A case-crossover study with only 209 men and 181 women
reported no increase in stroke risk in the hour after cola con-
sumption (RR: 1.0; 95% CI: 0.4, 2.4; P = 0.95) (40), and intake
was not associated with total mortality or cardiovascular mortality
among 1900 men and women followed for an average of 3.8 y
after an acute myocardial infarction (41). Of the sugar-sweetened
beverages, cola was recently reported to be associated with the

greatest risk of CAD (RR per a 2-serving/d increase: 1.35; 95%
CI: 1.15, 1.57) (6), whereas low-calorie beverages were not as-
sociated with risk (6).

Our analysis had strengths and limitations. The prospective
collection of data on soda consumption and lifestyle factors
minimized the potential for recall bias or reverse causation. The
high rate of follow-up reduced bias due to loss to follow-up.
Repeated dietary intake data served to reduce random mea-
surement error, and any residual random error would likely lead
to an underestimate of the true effect of exposures with outcome.
The ability to measure for known cardiovascular disease risk
factors permitted control for possible confounders in multivar-
iable models. Adjustment for the presence of behaviors, such as
regular exercise and taking a daily multivitamin, reduces the
likelihood that lifestyle characteristics confound the associations
observed between substituting alternative beverages for soda.
Nevertheless, because of the observational nature of this study,
we cannot exclude the possibility of residual and unmeasured
confounding. Our ﬁnding of an association between low-calorie
soda intake and stroke risk should be interpreted with caution,
because we previously did not ﬁnd an association between low-
calorie beverages and weight gain (42), diabetes (9), or CAD (6),
and there is not a clear biologic mechanism between low-calorie
soda consumption and incident stroke. Finally, there were few
cases of hemorrhagic stroke among men, especially among men
consuming 1 sugar-sweetened soda/d; therefore, our analysis
of the association between sugar-sweetened soda consumption
and hemorrhagic stroke among men must also be interpreted
cautiously.

In conclusion, in these large studies of US men and women, we
found that greater consumption of sugar-sweetened and low-
calorie sodas was associated with a higher risk of stroke.
Compared with the same number of servings of soda, con-
sumption of caffeinated or decaffeinated coffee was associated
with a lower risk. Stroke burden may therefore be reduced by
changing patterns of beverage consumption in the United States.

Epidemiology

Mediterranean Diet and Incidence of and Mortality From

Coronary Heart Disease and Stroke in Women

Teresa T. Fung, ScD; Kathryn M. Rexrode, MD; Christos S. Mantzoros, MD;

JoAnn E. Manson, MD, DrPH; Walter C. Willett, MD, DrPH; Frank B. Hu, MD, PhD

Background—Several studies have documented an inverse association between adherence to the Mediterranean diet and risk of
coronary heart disease (CHD), but few data are available on the relationship between Mediterranean diet and risk of stroke.
Methods and Results—For the present study, 74 886 women 38 to 63 years of age in the Nurses’ Health Study, a cohort
study of female nurses, without a history of cardiovascular disease and diabetes were followed up from 1984 to 2004.
We computed an Alternate Mediterranean Diet Score from self-reported dietary data collected through validated food
frequency questionnaires administered 6 times between 1984 and 2002. Relative risks for incident CHD, stroke, and
combined fatal cardiovascular disease were estimated with Cox proportional-hazards models adjusted for cardiovascular
risk factors. During 20 years of follow-up, 2391 incident cases of CHD, 1763 incident cases of stroke, and 1077
cardiovascular disease deaths (fatal CHD and strokes combined) were ascertained. Women in the top Alternate
Mediterranean Diet Score quintile were at lower risk for both CHD and stroke compared with those in the bottom
quintile (relative risk [RR], 0.71; 95% CI, 0.62 to 0.82; P for trend⬍0.0001 for CHD; RR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.73 to 1.02;
P for trend⫽0.03 for stroke). Cardiovascular disease mortality was significantly lower among women in the top quintile
of the Alternate Mediterranean Diet Score (RR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.49 to 0.76; P for trend⬍0.0001).

Conclusion—A greater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by a higher Alternate Mediterranean Diet Score,

was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and stroke in women. (Circulation. 2009;119:1093-1100.)

Key Words: coronary disease 䡲 diet 䡲 nutrition 䡲 stroke

The traditional Mediterranean diet is characterized by a

high intake of monounsaturated fat, plant proteins, whole
grains, and fish; moderate intake of alcohol; and low con-
sumption of red meat, refined grains, and sweets.1 An
intervention trial has recently shown that the Mediterranean
diet is more effective in promoting weight loss and lowering
the ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in
obese individuals than a low-fat diet.2 Previously, the Lyon
Heart Study showed that the Mediterranean diet was more
effective than a low-fat diet in the secondary prevention of
cardiac events.3,4 Since then, the Mediterranean diet pattern
has been shown in several prospective studies from around
the world to be inversely associated with total and cardiovas-
cular (CVD) mortality.5,6 However, data are limited for its
relationship with nonfatal cardiovascular events. To the best
of our knowledge, no studies have specifically focused on the
incidence of stroke or stroke mortality. In addition,
in
investigating the association between diet and disease with a
slow progression such as coronary heart disease (CHD) and
stroke, the availability of multiple dietary measurements over
time provides a better estimate of overall diet over the
follow-up period.

Clinical Perspective p 1100

We have previously constructed a Mediterranean diet
adherence score for the Nurses’ Health Study (NHS)7 based
on a prior scoring system developed for Greek populations.8
This Alternate Mediterranean Diet Score (aMed) focuses on
higher consumption of plant foods, including plant proteins,
monounsaturated fat, and fish and lower consumption of
animal products and saturated fat. In the present analysis, we
used data from multiple dietary assessments to prospectively
examine the association between the aMed and risk of incident
CHD and stroke, as well as CVD mortality, in women. We also
combined nonfatal and fatal CHD and stroke incidence to assess
the association of aMed with major CVD events.

Methods

Study Population
The NHS is a cohort study of 121 700 female nurses 30 to 55 years
of age living in 11 US states at the time of inception (1976). The first
questionnaire regarding medical, lifestyle, and other health-related
information was sent at that time.9 Since then, questionnaires have
been sent biennially to update this information. Follow-up was

complete for ⬎95% of the potential person-time up to 2004. In 1980,
the participants completed a 61-item food frequency questionnaire
(FFQ). In 1984, the FFQ was expanded to 116 items. Similar FFQs
were sent in 1986, 1990, 1994, 1998, and 2002.

For this analysis, we included women who completed the 1984
FFQ with ⬍70 missing items and total energy intake (as calculated
from the FFQ) between 500 and 3500 kcal/d.10 At baseline, we
excluded those with a history of CHD, stroke, or diabetes because
diagnoses of these conditions may lead to changes in diet. Thus, 76 522
women with follow-up from 1984 through 2004 were included in the
analyses. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of
the Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Boston, Mass.

Dietary Assessment
Self-reported FFQs were designed to assess average food intake over
the preceding year. A standard portion size and 9 possible frequency
of consumption responses, ranging from “never or less than once per
month” to “ⱖ6 times per day” were given for each food. Total
energy and nutrient intake was calculated by summing energy or
nutrients from all foods. Previous validation studies in this cohort
revealed good correlations between nutrients assessed by the FFQ
and multiple weeks of food records completed over the preceding
year.10 For example, correlation coefficients between the 1986 FFQ
and 4 weeks of diet records obtained in 1986 were 0.68 for saturated
fat and 0.78 for crude fiber. The mean correlation coefficient
between frequencies of intake of 55 foods assessed by 2 FFQ 12
months apart was 0.57.10,11

The aMed score was adapted from the Mediterranean diet scale by
Trichopoulou et al.8 Our components include vegetables (excluding
potatoes), fruits, nuts, whole grains, legumes, fish, ratio of monoun-
saturated to saturated fat, red and processed meats, and alcohol.
Participants with intake above the median intake received 1 point for
these categories; otherwise, they received 0 points. Red and pro-
cessed meat consumption below the median received 1 point. We
assigned 1 point for alcohol intake between 5 and 15 g/d. This
represents approximately one 12-oz can of regular beer, 5 oz of wine,
or 1.5 oz of liquor. The possible score range for aMed was 0 to 9,
with a higher score representing closer resemblance to the Mediter-
ranean diet. Table 1 shows the intake of aMed components during
the follow-up periods. Consumption of each food group was stable
across time except for a trend toward a decrease in alcohol and
red/processed meat intake.

End-Point Ascertainment
For these analyses, we ascertained incident cases of CHD (nonfatal
myocardial infarct [MI] or fatal CHD) and stroke that occurred after
the return of the 1984 questionnaire but before June 1, 2004. We
requested permission to review medical records from women who
reported having a nonfatal MI or stroke on each biennial question-

naire. Physicians unaware of the self-reported risk factor status
reviewed the records. For each case, the year and month of diagnosis
were recorded as the diagnosis date. For MI, we noted whether it was
fatal or nonfatal. MI was classified as confirmed if the criteria of the
World Health Organization were met, specifically, symptoms and
either echocardiogram changes or elevated cardiac enzyme levels.12
If medical records were not available, the case was considered
probable. We included confirmed and probable cases for the analy-
ses. Fatal CHD events were confirmed by hospital records, by
autopsy, or by CHD listed as the cause of death on the death
certificate, if it was listed as an underlying and the most plausible
cause of death, and if evidence of previous CHD was available.

Strokes were confirmed by medical record review using National
Survey of Stroke criteria,13 which require a constellation of neuro-
logical deficits, sudden or rapid in onset with a duration of at least 24
hours or until death. We classified strokes as ischemic (embolic or
thrombotic), hemorrhagic (subarachnoid or intracerebral), or unde-
termined according to medical record evidence and computed
tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, or autopsy findings.
Deaths were identified from state vital statistics records and the
National Death Index or reported by the families and the postal
system. Strokes for which medical records were not available were
considered probable. In our cohort, ⬇17% of all strokes and 24% of
MIs were classified as probable. Confirmed and probable cases were
combined in our analyses.

Assessment of Covariates
Body mass index (BMI) was calculated from weight reported on
each biennial questionnaire and height reported in 1976. In each
biennial questionnaire, we also assessed smoking status (including
number of cigarettes), frequency and number of aspirin tablets used,
multivitamin intake, and menopausal status and use of postmeno-
pausal hormone. Leisure-time physical activity was measured bien-
nially beginning in 1986 with a validated questionnaire asking about
average time spent on 10 common activities. The information was
then summed and calculated as metabolic equivalent hours.14

Statistical Analysis
We used Cox proportional-hazard modeling to assess the association
between the aMed score and risk of CHD and stroke, including
separate models for fatal and nonfatal CHD and ischemic and
hemorrhagic stroke because the cause of subtypes may differ. We
combined all CHD and stroke cases as total major CVDs and fatal
CHD and fatal stroke as fatal major CVDs. For individuals with
confirmed diagnoses of stroke and CHD on the same year and
month, we included both end points in the CHD or stroke analyses.
However, these individuals contributed to only 1 end point in the
total major CVD analysis.

To reduce random within-person variation and to best represent
long-term dietary intake, we calculated cumulative averages of the
aMed score from our repeated FFQs.15 For example, the aMed score
in 1984 was used to predict CHD and stroke occurrence from 1984
to 1986, and the average score from 1984 and 1986 was used to
predict CHD and stroke risk from 1986 to 1990, and so forth. An
overall risk ratio for the entire follow-up period was then computed
with the Cox proportional-hazards model. We adjusted for the
following potential confounders, which were updated at each 2-year
cycle: age (continuous), smoking (never, past, or current with
cigarette use of 1 to 14, 15 to 24, ⱖ25 per day or missing), BMI
(⬍22, 22.1 to 23.0, 23.1 to 24.9, 25.0 to 29.9, ⱖ30 kg/m2),
menopausal status and postmenopausal hormone use (premeno-
pausal, never, past, current hormone use), energy intake (quintiles),
multivitamin intake (yes/no), alcohol intake (0, up to 5, 5 to 15, ⬎15
g/d), family history (yes/no), physical activity (quintiles), and aspirin
use (⬍1, 1 to 2, 3 to 6, 7 to 14, ⱖ15 per week). Statistical analysis
was conducted with SAS version 9 (SAS Institute, Inc, Cary, NC).
In secondary analyses, we additionally adjusted for use of choles-
terol-lowering and antihypertensive medications, history of hyper-
tension, hypercholesterolemia, and diabetes diagnosed during
follow-up. We also stratified by major risk factors at baseline to
evaluate potential interactions between these factors and the aMed in
relation to CHD and stroke risk. In addition, we assessed the

association between changes in aMed score between 1984 and 1990
and risk of CHD and stroke from 1990 to 2004.

The authors had full access to and take responsibility for the integrity
of the data. All authors have read and agree to the manuscript as written.

Results

During up to 20 years of follow-up, we ascertained 2391
cases of CHD, of which 1597 were nonfatal and 794 were
fatal. We also ascertained 1763 cases of stroke, of which 959
cases were ischemic, 329 cases were hemorrhagic, and 475
cases could not be clearly classified. Of all strokes, 1480 cases
were nonfatal and 283 cases were fatal. At baseline, women
with higher aMed score tended to exercise more and were less
likely to be smokers (Table 2). They also consumed more
calories and fiber but less saturated fat.

After adjusting for potential confounders, we observed a
significant inverse association between aMed and risk of
CHD. Women in the top quintile of aMed score had a relative
risk (RR) of 0.71 (95% CI, 0.62 to 0.82; P for trend⬍0.0001)
compared with those in the bottom quintile (Table 3). The
association appears somewhat stronger for fatal CHD, with an

follow-up for both CHD and stroke.

In stratified analyses, we observed consistent results accord-
ing to all covariates except for BMI (Tables 5 and 6). The inverse
association between aMed and CHD was stronger among women
with BMI ⬍25 kg/m2 (RR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.46 to 0.71; P for
trend⬍0.0001) than those with BMI ⱖ25 kg/m2 (RR, 0.84; 95% CI,
0.69 to 1.02; P for trend⫽0.08; P for interaction⫽0.005). However,
such an interaction was not found for stroke.

Women who remained in the highest quintiles (fourth or fifth
quintile; 294 CHD cases) between 1984 and 1990 had an RR of
0.72 (95% CI, 0.61 to 0.84; P⬍0.0001) for developing CHD
during follow-up from 1990 to 2004 compared with those who
remained in the lowest quintiles (first or second quintile; 410
cases). Risk for CHD for women who changed from low to high
score (126 cases) or from high to low score (118 cases) was not
significantly different from those who remained low.

When we evaluated total CVD (combined CHD and stroke
incidence), we noted a 22% risk reduction comparing extreme
quintiles of aMed score (P for trend⬍0.0001) after multivariate

adjustment (Figure, A). Fatal CVD (fatal CHD and fatal stroke
combined) risk also was lower among women in the top quintile
of the aMed score (RR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.49 to 0.76; P for
trend⬍0.0001) compared with those in the lowest quintile
(Figure, B).

Discussion

In the present large cohort of women with 20 years of follow-up,
greater adherence to a Mediterranean dietary pattern, as mea-
sured by a higher aMed score, was significantly associated with
lower risk of incident CHD and stroke. We also observed lower
CVD mortality with higher aMed score.

Previous studies generally support an inverse association
between adherence to the Mediterranean dietary pattern and
risk of CHD. Among middle-aged American, a high aMed
score (ⱖ6) was associated with a 22% reduction in cardio-
vascular mortality in men and a 19% reduction in mortality in
women compared with those with a low score (ⱕ3).6 Elderly
Europeans with no history of cardiovascular disease who
adhered to the Mediterranean diet more closely had a lower
risk of CHD mortality.8 However, we are unaware of any

prior reports that specifically examined the association be-
tween Mediterranean diet and stroke incidence.

A Mediterranean dietary pattern shares components with
several other healthy eating patterns that have previously been
shown to reduce cardiovascular disease risk. The Alternate
Healthy Eating Index, emphasizing plant foods and unsaturated
oils, was shown to reduce CVD mortality in both men and
women.16 In addition, the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hyper-
tension diet pattern, which also emphasizes high intake of plant
foods, low intake of animal protein, and low intake of sweets,17
was associated with lower risk of CHD and stroke in this
cohort.18

The Mediterranean diet has been linked to beneficial
effects on inflammatory markers, lipids, and blood pressure.
In cross-sectional analyses, adherence to the Mediterranean
diet as measured by various indexes was associated with
lower levels of C-reactive protein19 and interleukin-620 and
markers of endothelial function.19,21 A 2-year randomized
trial with a Mediterranean-style diet was effective in reducing
C-reactive protein and interleukin-6 in individuals with met-
abolic syndrome.22 A higher Mediterranean diet score was
associated with more favorable levels of adiponectin,23 an
adipocytokine linked to CHD risk.24 In a Greek population
without hypertension, a higher Mediterranean diet score was
associated with lower systolic and diastolic blood pressures.25
In another 3-month randomized trial, the traditional Mediter-
ranean diet was more effective in reducing oxidized low-

density lipoprotein levels26 and blood pressure than a low-fat
diet.27 In a 2-year randomized trial, the Mediterranean diet
has resulted in significant weight loss and a more favorable
ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and was
more effective than a low-fat diet.2

The association between Mediterranean dietary pattern
appeared even stronger for fatal than nonfatal CHD. Fatal
CHD events are generally characterized by either more severe
disease or arrhythmia. This may reflect
that higher fish
intake, an important component of the aMed, has been
strongly associated with lower risk of CHD deaths.28,29 A
stronger association with fatal CVD events is consistent with
the idea that the Mediterranean dietary pattern not only is
beneficial for prevention of nonfatal CVD events but also can
improve survival among patients with existing CVD.3,4

The aMed is based on the literature and our a priori
hypotheses. A score always involves some level of arbitrary
decision in the type and number of foods to be included and
assignment of points to different levels of intake. Although
our score is largely similar to those reported in the literature
in the choice of food groups, there are some differences. The
score used by Pitsavos et al30 and that developed by Tricho-
poulou et al8 awarded points for potato intake, but ours did
not. The Trichopoulou et al score included a dairy compo-
nent; the aMed did not. In addition, several dietary factors
that have been demonstrated to be important for CHD risk
such as trans fat,31 n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids,32 and
glycemic load33,34 were not included in any of the Mediter-
ranean diet scores. However, the omitted dietary components
are likely to be associated with foods that are included in the
score; thus, the score does account for them to a certain
extent. For example, in our cohort, women with high aMed
score appeared to have lower trans fat intake.

Another difference between scoring systems is the assignment
of points. The score used by Pitsavos et al30 classified adherence
by assigning 0 to 5 points for each food component, whereas the
scoring by Trichopoulou et al8 and aMed used dichotomous
points. However, results from different studies generally showed
more favorable health outcomes in individuals with a higher
Mediterranean diet score regardless of the scoring criteria. The
aMed score assignment depends on intake relative to the level in
the population. Therefore, when the scoring algorithm is applied
to different populations, individuals from these populations may
have the same score, but actual intake of each component could
vary substantially.

The major sources of monounsaturated fat differ between the
United States and other countries, especially Mediterranean
countries, and by time period. In the first half of the follow-up
period, the major sources (⬎30%) of monounsaturated fat in our
cohort were beef and other meats. In the second half of
follow-up, the contribution of beef and other meats dropped to
⬇18%. At the same time, olive oil consumption increased
considerably, but it still contributed only ⬇10% of all monoun-
saturated fat intake. In contrast, in traditional Mediterranean
diets of the 1960s, olive oil, along with other plant foods, is the
primary source of monounsaturated fat intake.1

The long follow-up period in this study allowed us to assess
long-term associations between the aMed score and CVD. The
prospective assessment of diet and lifestyle information in this

Fung et al

analysis reduces the probability of recall bias. A high rate of
follow-up reduced potential selection bias caused by systematic
loss to follow-up. We used repeated measurements of diet to
obtain a better assessment of long-term overall diet and to reduce
measurement error, and CVD ascertainment was not influenced
by risk factor or dietary intake of the cases. Confounding is
always a concern in observational studies, and some level of
residual confounding is unavoidable. Given our detailed and
updated adjustment for potential confounders, it is unlikely that
this would account for the observed results. Because this
analysis is conducted in women and because it is the first report
on the effects of Mediterranean diet on stroke, our results need
to be replicated in other populations, especially men.

Conclusion

A greater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, as reflected by
a higher aMed score, was associated with a lower risk of
incident CHD and stroke in women.

CLINICAL PERSPECTIVE

The present study examined the association between the Alternate Mediterranean Diet Score (aMed) and risk of CHD and
stroke in the Nurses’ Health Study. A higher score represents higher intake of vegetables (excluding potatoes), fruits, nuts,
whole grains, legumes, fish, and ratio of monounsaturated to saturated fat; lower intake of red and processed meats; and
alcohol intake between 5 and 15 g/d. Although a number of studies on various scores have measured adherence to the
Mediterranean diet, most of them focused on total or CHD mortality, and none examined stroke as a separate outcome. This
study differs by examining the incidence of CHD and stroke, which includes both fatal and nonfatal events. After
adjustment for known risk factors for cardiovascular disease and energy intake, women in the highest 20% of the Alternate
Mediterranean Diet Score had a lower risk for both CHD and stroke. Therefore, greater adherence to the Mediterranean
diet, as reflected by a higher Alternate Mediterranean Diet Score, was associated with a lower risk of incident CHD and
stroke in women.

Background & aims: The association between coronary heart disease (CHD) and dietary ﬁber intake is not
consistent, especially for the subtypes of dietary ﬁber. The aim of our study was to conduct a meta-
analysis of existing cohort published studies assessing the association between dietary ﬁber intake
and risk of CHD, and quantitatively estimating their doseeresponse relationships.
Methods: We searched PubMed and EMBASE before May 2013. Random-effect model was used to
calculate the pool relative risk (RRs) for the incidence and mortality of CHD. Doseeresponse, subgroup
analyses based on ﬁber subtypes, heterogeneity and publication bias were also carried out.
Results: Eighteen studies involving 672,408 individuals were ﬁnally included in the present study. The
pooled-adjusted RRs of coronary heart disease for the highest versus lowest category of ﬁber intake were
0.93 (95% conﬁdence interval (CI), 0.91e0.96, P < 0.001) for incidence of all coronary events and 0.83
(95% CI, 0.76e0.91, P < 0.001) for mortality. Further subgroup analyses based on ﬁber subtypes (cereal,
fruit, and vegetable ﬁber), indicated that RRs were 0.92 (95% CI, 0.85e0.99, P ¼ 0.032), 0.92 (95% CI, 0.86
e0.98, P ¼ 0.01), 0.95 (95% CI, 0.89e1.01, P ¼ 0.098) respectively for all coronary event and 0.81 (95% CI,
0.72e0.92, P ¼ 0.001), 0.68 (95% CI, 0.43e1.07, P ¼ 0.094), 0.91 (95% CI, 0.74e1.12, P ¼ 0.383) for mor-
tality. In addition, a signiﬁcant doseeresponse relationship was observed between ﬁber intake and the
incidence and mortality of CHD (P < 0.001).
Conclusions: Our results indicate that consumption of dietary ﬁber is inversely associated with risk of
coronary heart disease, especially for ﬁber from cereals and fruits. Besides, soluble and insoluble ﬁbers
have the similar effect. A signiﬁcant doseeresponse relationship is also observed between ﬁber intake
and CHD risk.

1. Introduction

Coronary heart disease (CHD) is a major cause of death world-
wide [1,2] With the global aging of populations, the prevalence of
CHD is increasing rapidly. Although treatment such as the percu-
taneous coronary intervention is usually available and effective, the
growing need for CHD therapy still imposes a heavy personal and

societal economic burden [3,4]. Therefore, prevention through
modifying potential risk factors appears to be excellent nonsurgical
strategies for preventing CHD.

Various risk factors including age, gender, hypercholesterole-
mia, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity and diet play critical
roles in atherosclerosis of coronary artery, which is the main cause
of CHD [5e7]. Reports of studies have strongly suggested that di-
etary ﬁber intake might provide protection against coronary heart
disease [8e11] and the potential mechanisms include that ﬁber can
modify blood lipid proﬁles, lower blood pressure, as well as reduce
blood glucose concentrations by slowing intestinal absorption.
Mark A, etc [12] reported a pooled analysis of the association be-
tween dietary ﬁber and risk of CHD in 2004, which showed that
higher dietary ﬁber intake was inversely associated with CHD
incidence and mortality (pooled RR was 0.86 for all CHD events, and

0.73 for CHD mortality). Although the association of those studies
[8e11] between total ﬁber and risk of CHD in humans were
consistent, the results of subtypes (cereal, fruit, vegetable, soluble
and insoluble ﬁber) were not [12]. Therefore, it's necessary to
conduct a more timely study to assess that association, because
there have been many new independent studies completed since
2004. Thus, much larger sample size and more accurate subgroups
and doseeresponse analysis were available in our present research.
The aim of our study was to systematically reevaluate the evi-
dence from these studies on ﬁber quantity and type and the risk of
CHD by summarizing it quantitatively with a meta-analysis
approach.

2. Methods

original articles were also scanned for potential studies missed in
the primary searches. Titles and abstracts of articles identiﬁed from
the initial search were ﬁres scanned, and then full papers of po-
tential eligible studies were reviewed. This meta-analysis was
designed, conducted and reported according to PRISMA and
MOOSE statements [13].

We included articles if they met all the following criteria: (1)
cohort study published as an original article; (2) the study of in-
terest was the dietary ﬁber intake; (3) the outcome of interest was
coronary heart disease, and (4) relative risk (RR) or hazard ratios
(HR) estimates and their 95% conﬁdence intervals (95%CI) adjusted
for age, sex, smoking, alcohol, BMI, exercise, blood pressure
(Table 1) were available or could be calculated. Only the most
recent information was include when data was duplicated.

2.1. Data sources, search strategy and section criteria

2.2. Data extraction

Systematic literature searches were conducted of 2 databases:
PubMed, and EMBASE up to May 2013. “Fiber” OR “ﬁbre” was used
as search terms together with “coronary heart disease” OR “CHD”
OR “CVD” OR “CAD” OR “IHD”, and “risk” OR “morbidity” OR
“incidence” OR “mortality”. Coronary heart disease is a narrowing
of the small blood vessels that supply blood and oxygen to the heart
including angina, myocardial infarction, latent coronary heart dis-
ease, ischemic heart disease and sudden death according to World
Health Organization. The references of relevant reviews and

Two reviewers (Y.Q. and Y.P.) independently extracted data us-
ing a standardized data extraction form. Any discrepancy was
resolved by a third reviewer (P.L.). Information extracted from each
article included the following items: ﬁrst author, year of publica-
tion, country of origin (continent), type of study design, sample
size, mean age, sex, outcomes deﬁnitions and grading, relative risk
(RR) or hazard ratios (HR), and corresponding 95% conﬁdence in-
tervals (CIs) for “the highest versus the lowest category of ﬁber
intake”.
If a study provided several risk estimates, the most

completely adjusted estimate was extracted. The study quality was
assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale [14].

2.3. Statistical analysis

The association between dietary ﬁber intake and CHD risk was
estimated by calculating pooled relative risk (RRs) and 95% CIs by a
random-effect model. The extent of heterogeneity across studies
was checked using the Q statistic and I2 test [15]. P  0.05 in
combination with I2>50% indicates signiﬁcant heterogeneity.
Moreover, we performed subgroup analyses to evaluate potential
effect modiﬁcation of variables including ﬁber subtypes (cereal,
fruit, vegetable, soluble and insoluble), country, sex, sample size,
study quality. Besides, subgroup analysis and sensitivity analysis
were adopted to explore potential heterogeneity.

We analyzed the doseeresponse relationship between dietary
ﬁber intake and CHD risk using linear, ﬁrst-order, and second-order
fractional polynomial regression of the inverse variance-weighted
data to estimate a curve of best ﬁt [15]. Best-ﬁt curve was
selected using decreased deviance compared with the reference
model. Comparisons of curves to determine best ﬁt were done
using a chi-square distribution [16]. We used generalized least
squares (GLST) for trend estimation of summarized doseeresponse
data [17].

To assess the publication bias, funnel plots (ie, plots of study
results against precision) were constructed. The Egger's regression
test was adopted to test the asymmetry of funnel plots (P < 0.1 was
considered representative of statistically signiﬁcant publication
bias) [18]. All analyses were conducted using Stata software
(version 11.0; StatCorp, College Station, TX, USA), and the signiﬁ-
cance level was set to P < 0.05.

3. Results

3.1. Literature search

After searching PubMed and EMBASE, we identiﬁed 532 articles,
502 of which were excluded after review of abstracts and titles.
After full-text review of the remaining 30 articles, 12 articles were
excluded for the following reasons: 3 articles were not cohort ar-
ticles studies, and 9 articles provided insufﬁcient data. The
remaining 18 cohort studies [1,19e35], were included in our meta-
analysis. Particularly the Nurses' Health Study (NHS) [20] was
divided into two parts: NHSa and NHSb, which the follow-up pe-
riods were 1980e1986 and 1986e1996. Their data analysis fol-
lowed the consistent standards and conducted independently.

3.2. Study characteristics

Eighteen cohort studies with 672,408 participants were
included in our meta-analysis, as detailed in Table 1. All articles
were published between 1992 and 2013. Of these eighteen studies,
eight were conducted in the USA, two in Finland, Japan, and UK,
respectively, one in Denmark, Sweden, and Netherland, respec-
tively, and one is international collaborative study with many
different populations. Among the overall studies which reported

the correlation between dietary ﬁber intake and CHD risk, sixteen
studies evaluated the incidence of CHD, and ﬁfteen evaluated the
mortality of CHD as shown in Table 2. Most studies had reported the
risk estimation adjusted for age (18 studies), sex (15 studies),
smoking (18 studies), alcohol (15 studies), BMI (17 studies), exercise
(16 studies), blood pressure (17 studies).

3.3. Association between dietary ﬁber intake and the incidence of
CHD

The multivariable-adjusted RRs for each study and combination
of all studies for the highest versus lowest category of ﬁber intake
were shown in Fig. 1. We found that higher ﬁber intake was sta-
tistically signiﬁcant associated with decreased incidence of CHD
(pooled RR ¼ 0.93, 95% CI, 0.91e0.96; P < 0.001; I2 ¼ 0.0%). In
subgroup analyses, results from these studies on different dietary
ﬁber (cereal, fruit, vegetable) intake in relation to CHD were
analyzed. As show in Fig. 2, ﬁve studies were included in the
analysis of the association between these three categories of ﬁber
intake and incidence of CHD [20,28,30e32], The pooled analysis in
Table 2 demonstrated a signiﬁcant association between both higher
cereal ﬁber and fruit ﬁber intake and decreased CHD incidence
(pooled RR ¼ 0.92, 95% CI, 0.85e0.99, P ¼ 0.032; pooled RR ¼ 0.92,
95% CI, 0.86e0.98, P ¼ 0.01, respectively); however, higher vege-
table ﬁber intake was not signiﬁcantly associated with CHD inci-
dence (pooled RR ¼ 0.95 (95% CI, 0.89e1.01, P ¼ 0.098). We also
examined the associations between soluble and insoluble ﬁber
intake and incidence of CHD [19,25,30,31], as shown in Fig. 3. The
results indicated that both types of ﬁber intake were inversely
associated with CHD incidence (for soluble ﬁber, pooled RR ¼ 0.84,
95% CI, 0.75e0.93, P ¼ 0.002; for insoluble ﬁber, pooled RR ¼ 0.85,
95% CI, 0.72e1.00, P ¼ 0.044, respectively).
Statistically signiﬁcant heterogeneity existed among the studies
assessing cereal ﬁber intake and incidence of CHD (I2 ¼ 54.1%,
P ¼ 0.053), but not existed among the studies of fruit ﬁber
(I2 ¼ 0.0%; P ¼ 0.892) and vegetable ﬁber (I2 ¼ 0.0%; P ¼ 0.88). A
sensitivity analysis was conducted to ﬁnd the source of heteroge-
neity, which might be explained by a sex difference due to positive
associations in 1 cohort of women-NHSb [20]. Removing this study
from our study, no signiﬁcant heterogeneity existed (I2 ¼ 20.2%,
P ¼ 0.286), and a borderline signiﬁcant association was found be-
tween cereal intake and CHD incidence (pooled RR ¼ 0.95, 95% CI,
0.91e1.01, P ¼ 0.07).

3.4. Association between dietary ﬁber intake and the mortality of
CHD

A total of ﬁfteen studies assessed the association between di-
etary ﬁber and the mortality of CHD. The multivariable-adjusted
RRs for each study and combination of all studies for the highest
versus lowest category of ﬁber were shown in Fig. 4. We found that
higher ﬁber intake was signiﬁcantly associated with decreased

ﬁber subtype [2,23,27,31]. As shown in Fig. 5, the pooled analysis
also showed a signiﬁcant association between higher cereal intake

and decreased CHD mortality (pooled RR ¼ 0.81, 95% CI, 0.72e0.92,
P ¼ 0.001); however, CHD mortality was not signiﬁcantly correlated
with fruit or vegetable ﬁber (pooled RR ¼ 0.68, 95% CI, 0.43e1.07,
P ¼ 0.094; 0.91, 95% CI, 0.74e1.12, P ¼ 0.383, respectively).
Statistically signiﬁcant heterogeneity existed among the studies
exploring fruit ﬁber intake and mortality of CHD (I2 ¼ 71.7%,
P ¼ 0.007), but not existed among the studies of cereal ﬁber
(I2 ¼ 0.0%; P ¼ 0.799) and vegetable ﬁber (I2 ¼ 0.0%; P ¼ 0.997).
Initially, we considered that gender, publication country, number of
participant and method might contribute to the heterogeneity.
However, meta-regression analysis indicated that above variables
were not the sources of heterogeneity. Sensitivity analysis found
that the meta-analysis was inﬂuenced obviously by individual
study. For example, if the data of ATBC was removed, no signiﬁcant
heterogeneity was found among remained studies (I2 ¼ 8.1%,
P ¼ 0.353). Only 3 studies reported the association between soluble
ﬁber and mortality of CHD [2,19,31], and 2 studies assessed insol-
uble ﬁber [2,31], As shown in Fig. 3, signiﬁcant associations with
CHD mortality were indicated for both two categories (pooled
RR ¼ 0.73 (0.61e0.88), P ¼ 0.001; 0.75 (0.58e0.96), P ¼ 0.024
respectively).

The remaining subgroup analyses based on the geographic re-
gion, sex, sample size, dietary questionnaire and study quality be-
tween ﬁber intake and CHD risk were shown in Table 3. In the
subgroup of geographic region, the pooled RRs of association of
incidence and mortality were signiﬁcant both for Asian (pooled
RR ¼ 0.79; 0.72) and Caucasian (pooled RR ¼ 0.94; 0.84). The
subgroup based on sex showed Female had a stronger association
than male. Besides, the dietary questionnaire might be another
factor to inﬂuent the association between ﬁber and CHD, the RRs

were 0.89 versus 0.95 for FFQ and dietary history in incidence, and
0.81 versus 0.84 in mortality.

Nine studies were available for our doseeresponse analysis of

[19,20,23e26,30e32], and four studies for mortality [2,19,23,31].
We identiﬁed a signiﬁcant doseeresponse relationship between
ﬁber intake and the incidence and mortality. Best-ﬁt curves were
shown in Fig. 6, which showed each 10-g/d increment of total di-
etary ﬁber was associated with an 8% (pooled RR ¼ 0.92; 95% CI,
0.87e0.97) decrease in risk of all coronary events and a 24% (pooled

4. Discussion

The current meta-analysis summarized the results of 18
population-based cohort studies [1,19e35], with a total of 672,408
participants. Higher ﬁber intake had a signiﬁcantly inverse associ-
ation with CHD risk, both of incidence (7% reduction) and mortality
(17% reduction). Besides, subgroup analyses suggested that the
protection effect of ﬁber against CHD might be inﬂuenced by ﬁber
types. For types of cereal, fruit and vegetable ﬁber, a signiﬁcantly
inverse association was found between high cereal and fruit ﬁber
intake and incidence of CHD, while the inverse association between

high cereal ﬁber and the mortality was statistically signiﬁcant. As for
types of soluble and insoluble ﬁber, both of them had a signiﬁcant
inverse association with incidence and mortality. Furthermore, a
signiﬁcant doseeresponse relationship was observed between ﬁber
intake and the CHD risk, both for incidence and mortality.

Interestingly, although cereal and fruit ﬁber had strong inverse
associations with CHD risk, no such associations were observed for
vegetable ﬁber. There is a possibility that the common vegetables
may lead to high glycemic load, which is been shown to increase
the risk of CHD [36]. Besides, both soluble and insoluble ﬁber
showed a protection effect against CHD in our study. Previous
studies [30e32] also supported this possibility. However, these
results should be interpreted with caution, because among inci-
dence and mortality studies, no more than 4 studies were included.
More studies are needed to clarify this issue.

Dietary ﬁber intake may play a critical role in the coronary heart
disease [8,20,37]. The inverse relationship between dietary ﬁber

intake and CHD risk could be explained by many mechanisms. First,
ﬁber can modify blood lipid proﬁles, such as reducing serum total
cholesterol,
triglyceride and oxidized low-density lipoprotein
(oxLDL), which plays a critical role in the formation and progression
of atherosclerotic plaques [38]. Second, ﬁber can reduce blood
glucose concentrations by slowing intestinal absorption and
improving the sensitivity of insulin [39e42], thereby reducing
inﬂammation [43], enhancing antioxidant processes [44]. Further-
more, ﬁber can also lower blood pressure and increasing viability of
coronary artery endothelial cells and reducing intracellular ROS
generation [45]. These ﬁndings supported our results that higher
ﬁber intake might decrease CHD incidence and mortality. In addi-
tion, a strong correlation with CHD risk was observed for soluble
and insoluble ﬁbers, their characteristic might explain these ﬁnd-
ings: both soluble and insoluble ﬁber could possibly lower blood
pressure and slow intestinal absorption through increasing intra-
luminal viscosity, which has been shown to improve glucose

control by decreasing insulin secretion, reduce serum cholesterol to
inhibit hepatic cholesterol synthesis by fermenting in the large
bowel and producing short-chain fatty-acid [42,46,47]. This
founding recommends us that both of soluble and insoluble ﬁber
types-rich food might be beneﬁcial.

Furthermore, we identiﬁed a signiﬁcant doseeresponse rela-
tionship between ﬁber intake and risk of CHD; it is conceivable that
higher ﬁber intake might have more protection of coronary from
atherosclerosis than lower ﬁber intake.

Our study has several strengths. First,

this meta-analysis
included more prospective studies (eighteen cohort studies) and
much more participants than other relevant studies, which pro-
vided us more detailed and reliable data to analysis. Second, this
meta-analysis has a doseeresponse analysis of association between
ﬁber and CHD risk, which further strengthened the association.
Third, more detailed subgroup analysis based on ﬁber subtypes
(cereal, fruit, vegetable, soluble and insoluble) was also assessed in
our study, which could provide us more recognition about the ef-
fect of different ﬁber. Fourth, most of the included studies were of
high methodological quality. Finally, no publication bias was
observed, which indicates that the entire pooled results may be
unbiased.

However, this meta-analysis was limited in some aspects as
well. First, the number of studies with subgroup involved in the
meta-analysis was not large enough, especially in ﬁber of soluble or
insoluble. Second, the included studies were limited to Caucasian
and Asian, therefore the conclusions should be taken cautiously for
other ethnic populations. Third, the studies differed in their
method for assessing the dietary Questionnaire (Table 1). Fourteen
studies used the food frequency questionnaire (FFQ), the other four
studies used diet history. Thus, this may have introduced consid-
erable variability in the studies included for the meta-analysis.
Fourth, different cutoff points were adopted among some
included studies, which might also impact the current analysis
partly. Finally, heterogeneity could not be completely explained.

5. Conclusion

The present meta-analyses conﬁrmed that dietary ﬁber may be
inversely associated with CHD risk, especially for ﬁber from cereals
and fruits. As for soluble and insoluble ﬁbers, they had a similar
effect.
In addition, a signiﬁcant doseeresponse relationship is
observed between ﬁber intake and CHD risk. These ﬁndings are
conﬁrmed by the results of previously published cohort studies.

Sweetened Beverage Consumption Is Associated
with Increased Risk of Stroke in Women and Men1,2

Abstract

The consumption of sweetened beverages such as soft drinks has been associated with adverse effects on markers of

cardiovascular risk. We examined the hypothesis that high consumption of sweetened beverages increases the risk of
stroke. We followed 32,575 women aged 49283 y and 35,884 men aged 45279 y without cardiovascular disease, cancer,

or diabetes at baseline. The consumption of sweetened beverages, including sugar-sweetened and artiﬁcially sweetened

soft drinks and juice drinks, was assessed by using a food-frequency questionnaire. Stroke cases were ascertained by

linkage to the Swedish Inpatient Register and the Swedish Cause of Death Register. The data were analyzed by using a

Cox proportional hazards regression model. We ascertained 3510 incident cases of stroke, including 2588 cerebral

infarctions, 349 intracerebral hemorrhages, 156 subarachnoid hemorrhages, and 417 unspeciﬁed strokes, during a mean

follow-up of 10.3 y. Sweetened beverage consumption was signiﬁcantly positively associated with risk of total stroke and
cerebral infarction but not with hemorrhagic stroke. The multivariable RRs comparing $2 (median: 2.1) servings/d (200

mL/serving) with 0.1 to <0.5 (median: 0.3) servings/d were 1.19 (95% CI: 1.04, 1.36) for total stroke and 1.22 (95% CI:

1.04, 1.42) for cerebral infarction. These ﬁndings suggest that sweetened beverage consumption is positively associated

with the risk of stroke. J. Nutr. 144: 856–860, 2014.

Introduction

The consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages such as soft drinks
has been linked to adverse alterations in TG and cholesterol con-
centrations, markers of inﬂammation, leptin, and blood pressure
(1–4). Moreover, soft drink consumption has been associated with
increased risk of developing the metabolic syndrome (5), type 2
diabetes (5), and coronary heart disease (1,6). Given the observed
adverse effects of soft drink consumption on cardiometabolic
risk factors, high consumption of soft drinks may increase the
risk of stroke. However, prospective studies of the consumption of
sweetened beverages or soft drinks in relation to the risk of stroke
are limited and the results are inconsistent (7–9).

We used data from 2 prospective cohort studies in Swedish
women and men to evaluate the hypothesis that high consump-
tion of sweetened beverages, including soft drinks and sweet-
ened juice, is associated with an increased risk of stroke.

the present study. In late autumn of 1997, 39,227 women (Swedish
Mammography Cohort) and 48,850 men (Cohort of Swedish Men) who
lived in 3 counties (Uppsala, Va¨ stmanland, and O¨ rebro) of Sweden
completed a 350-item questionnaire that solicited information on diet
and other lifestyle factors. We excluded women and men with an
erroneous or a missing National Registration Number (n = 243 women
and n = 297 men), those with cancer (n = 1811 women and n = 2592
men) or cardiovascular disease (stroke, ischemic heart disease, angina,
heart failure, and atrial ﬁbrillation; n = 2827 women and n = 6512 men)
at baseline, those who died before the start of follow-up (n = 26 women
and n = 55 men), and those with implausible energy intakes (i.e., 3 SDs
from the loge-transformed mean total energy intake; n = 400 women and
n = 434 men). Moreover, participants were excluded if they had a history
of diabetes (self-reported in the questionnaire or with a diagnosis of
diabetes recorded in the Swedish National Inpatient Register or the
Swedish National Diabetes Register; n = 1345 women and n = 3076 men)
because they may have changed their consumption of sweetened
beverages after the diagnosis. After these exclusions, 68,459 participants
(32,575 women aged 49283 y and 35,884 men aged 45279 y) remained
for analysis. The study was approved by the Regional Ethical Review
Board at Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm, Sweden.

Baseline data collection. Information on education, body weight,
height, physical activity, cigarette smoking, aspirin use, history of
hypertension, family history of myocardial infarction before 60 y of age,
alcohol consumption, and diet was obtained through a self-administered
questionnaire. BMI was calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the
square of height in meters. Participants reported their activity level at
work, at home/doing housework, walking/bicycling, and performing
other exercise as well as inactivity (watching television/reading) and
hours per day of sitting/lying down and sleeping. The time per day

reported by the participant to have engaged in each activity was
multiplied by the activityÕs typical energy expenditure requirement (10)
expressed in metabolic equivalents. The metabolic equivalent-hours for
all activities were combined to create a metabolic equivalent-hours per
day (24-h) score (11). We calculated pack-years of smoking history by
multiplying the number of packs of cigarettes smoked per day by the
number of years of smoking.

Assessment of diet and beverages. Diet and beverage consumption
was assessed in 1997 with a semiquantitative FFQ, designed to assess the
Swedish diet, on which participants reported their average consumption
of 96 foods and beverages during the past year. For most food items, the
FFQ had 8 predeﬁned frequency categories. For commonly consumed
beverages, such as sweetened beverages (1 question), coffee, tea, and
milk, participants indicated their usual frequency of consumption per
day or per week of a standard 200 mL (1 glass) serving. The question
about sweetened beverages was ‘‘How many soft drinks or sweetened
juice drinks do you drink per day or per week?’’ We deﬁned sweetened
beverage consumption on the basis of
that single question. No
distinction was made between sugar-sweetened and low-calorie drinks.
According to national consumption data, in 1997, low-calorie drinks
represented 19.2% and 9.9% of total soft drink and sweetened juice
drink consumption for women and men, respectively (12).

In a validation study in a subsample of 129 women from the study
population, the Pearson correlation coefﬁcient between a similar FFQ
and four 1-wk diet records was 0.6 for sweetened beverage consumption
(A. Wolk, unpublished results). The FFQ used in the present study has
been validated for nutrient intake, and the Spearman correlation
coefﬁcients between estimates from the FFQ and the mean of fourteen
24-h recall interviews ranged from 0.44 (protein) to 0.81 (alcohol) for
macronutrients, with a mean value of 0.65 (13).

Case ascertainment and follow-up. Incident stroke cases that occurred
in the cohort during follow-up were ascertained by linkage of the study
population to the Swedish Inpatient Register and the Swedish Cause of
Death Register. Stroke cases were classiﬁed as cerebral infarction (Interna-
tional Classiﬁcation of Diseases, 10th revision, code I63), intracerebral
hemorrhage (code I61), subarachnoid hemorrhage (code I60), and unspec-
iﬁed stroke (code I64). Information on dates of death for deceased
participants was obtained from the Swedish Cause of Death Register.

Statistical analysis. Participants accrued follow-up time from 1 January
1998 until the date of diagnosis of stroke, date of death, or end of follow-
up (31 December 2008), whichever came ﬁrst. We categorized partic-
ipants into 5 groups of sweetened beverage consumption. This was done
by grouping those who consumed $0.1 servings/d into quartiles and then
ﬁnding the closest whole or half serving to create more interpretable
categories. Hence, the categories were 0, 0.1 to <0.5 (reference), 0.5 to
<1.0, 1.0 to <2.0, and $2.0 servings/d. We treated missing information
as no consumption. We conducted a sensitivity analysis in which we
excluded those with missing information on sweetened beverage
consumption, and results did not change. RRs with corresponding
95% CIs of total stroke, cerebral infarction, and hemorrhagic stroke
were estimated by using Cox proportional hazards regression models,
stratiﬁed by age (in months) and sex. All multivariable models were
further controlled for education (less than high school, high school, or
university) and known risk factors for stroke, including family history of
myocardial infarction before 60 y of age (yes or no), cigarette smoking
(never; past: <20, 20–39, or $40 pack-years; or current: <20, 20–39, or
$40 pack-years), total physical activity (metabolic equivalent-h/d,
quintiles), BMI (<20, 20–24.9, 25–29.9, or $30 kg/m2), history of
hypertension (yes or no), aspirin use (never, 1–6 tablets/wk, $7 tablets/
wk), total energy intake (continuous, kcal/d), and alcohol consumption
(quartiles, g/d). In a second multivariable model, we further adjusted for
beverages and foods that are associated with risk of stroke in this study
population, including coffee (14), tea (15), dairy products (16), fruits
and vegetables (17), chocolate (18,19), ﬁsh (20), and unprocessed and
processed red meat (21,22) (all in quartiles). The results did not change
materially after additional adjustment for sucrose-rich foods, including
buns/cookies, cakes/confections, and candy. Therefore, these foods were

not included in the multivariable model. In a sensitivity analysis, we
adjusted for waist circumference (sex-speciﬁc quartiles) instead of BMI.
A test for trend across categories of sweetened beverage consumption
was performed by assigning the median value for each category and
modeling this variable as a continuous variable. We used the likelihood
ratio test to test for interaction between sweetened beverage consump-
tion and smoking, history of hypertension, overweight (BMI $25 kg/m2),
and sex. The statistical analyses were conducted in SAS (version 9.3;
SAS Institute). All statistical tests were 2-tailed, and P values <0.05 were
considered signiﬁcant.

Results

Over a mean follow-up of 10.3 y (699,354 person-years) in
68,459 women and men free from cardiovascular disease,
cancer, and diabetes at baseline, 3510 incident stroke cases
(n = 1544 in women and n = 1966 in men) were ascertained. The
strokes included 2588 cerebral infarctions, 505 hemorrhagic
strokes (349 intracerebral hemorrhages and 156 subarachnoid
hemorrhages), and 417 unspeciﬁed strokes. Baseline character-
istics of the study population according to sweetened beverage
consumption are presented in Table 1. Compared with women
and men with low consumption of sweetened beverages (0.1 to
<0.5 servings/d), those who consumed $2 servings/d were less
likely to have a postsecondary education and more likely to be
overweight. They consumed slightly less fruits and vegetables
but had a higher total energy intake and consumed more dairy
products, unprocessed red meat, and processed meat.

Among women and men combined, the consumption of $2
(median: 2.1) servings/d of sweetened beverages was associated
with a statistically signiﬁcant increased risk of total stroke and
cerebral infarction but not of hemorrhagic stroke (Table 2).
After adjustment for other risk factors for stroke as well as for
dietary factors, women and men who consumed $2 servings/d
of sweetened beverages had a 19% (95% CI: 4%, 36%) and
22% (95% CI: 4%, 42%) increased risk of total stroke and
cerebral
infarction, respectively, compared with those who
rarely consumed these beverages (0.1 to <0.5 servings/d). Results
did not change when we adjusted for waist circumference
instead of BMI. We observed no signiﬁcant interaction between
sweetened beverage consumption and smoking (P-interaction =
0.92), history of hypertension (P-interaction = 0.77), or
overweight (P-interaction = 0.11) in relation to total stroke
risk. Furthermore, the association between sweetened beverage
consumption and stroke did not differ signiﬁcantly by sex
(P-interaction = 0.81 for total stroke, P-interaction = 0.94 for
infarction, P-interaction = 0.60 for hemorrhagic
cerebral
stroke), although the results for total stroke and cerebral
infarction were statistically signiﬁcant in men only (Table 3).

Discussion

This prospective study suggests that high consumption of
sweetened beverages, such as soft drinks, may increase the risk
of stroke, especially cerebral infarction. Those who consumed
$2 servings/d of sweetened beverages had a 22% higher risk of
cerebral infarction compared with those who consumed, on
average, ;2 servings/wk.

Our ﬁndings are consistent with those from a prospective
study in U.S. nurses and health professionals, which showed an
increased risk of stroke associated with both sugar-sweetened
and low-calorie soda (8). In that study in 84,085 women (n = 2938
stroke cases) and 43,371 men (n = 1416 stroke cases), the RRs of
total stroke comparing $1 servings/d with no consumption were

interaction by sex were 0.81 for total stroke, 0.94 for cerebral infarction, and 0.60 for hemorrhagic stroke.

energy intake, and alcohol consumption.

but not hemorrhagic stroke (corresponding RR: 0.70; 95%
CI: 0.40, 1.20) in women; no association was observed in
men (7). No association of regular soft drink or light soft drink
consumption with total stroke risk was found in the Northern
Manhattan Study in 2564 men and women (n = 225 stroke
cases) (9). However, daily consumption of diet soft drinks was
associated with a nonsigniﬁcant 28% increased risk of stroke.

There are several potential mechanisms whereby sweetened
beverage consumption may increase the risk of stroke. Sweetened
beverage consumption has been positively associated with the
metabolic syndrome (5) and its components (1,2). Findings from a
randomized, controlled crossover trial
in healthy young men
showed harmful effects of low to moderate consumption of
sugar-sweetened beverages on LDL particles, fasting glucose, and

high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (2). Furthermore,
in the
Health Professionals Follow-Up Study, sweetened beverage
consumption was positively associated with plasma TGs,
C-reactive protein, IL-6, and TNF receptors 1 and 2 and
inversely associated with HDL cholesterol, lipoprotein(a), and
leptin (1). Sugar-sweetened beverage consumption has been
found to increase blood glucose and insulin concentrations (23)
and has been positively associated with weight gain (24) and the
risk of developing type 2 diabetes (5). Overweight and obesity as
well as type 2 diabetes are well-established risk factors for
cerebral infarction (25,26) but are not clearly associated with
risk of hemorrhagic stroke (25,27). It has been suggested that
sugar-sweetened beverages promote weight gain by their high
added-sugar content, low satiety, and incomplete compensation

for total energy (28). The effect of liquid sugar intake on body
weight may also depend on dietary behavior, the mode of use,
availability, and the cost of sweetened liquids (29).

A potential explanation for the lack of association of sweetened
beverage consumption with hemorrhagic stroke may be that the
metabolic alterations (e.g., increased TGs, glucose, and inﬂamma-
tory factors) caused by sweetened beverage consumption do not
increase the risk of hemorrhagic stroke. Another possibility is the
relatively few cases of hemorrhagic stroke. The CIs for the relation
between sweetened beverage consumption and hemorrhagic stroke
were broad and we cannot exclude a possible association.

Strengths of this study include its prospective design, large
number of incident stroke cases, and the completeness of follow-
up of participants through linkage to population-based Swedish
registries. A limitation is its observational design. Hence, we
cannot exclude the possibility of residual confounding due to
unmeasured or imprecise measurement of other risk factors for
stroke. Another limitation is that sweetened beverage consump-
tion was assessed with a self-administered questionnaire and was
measured only once. This will inevitably lead to some measure-
ment error in the assessment of sweetened beverage consumption.
Because of the prospective design, any measurement error would
be expected to be nondifferential and most likely lead to an
attenuation of the true association. Sweetened beverage consump-
tion in Sweden declined slightly during the follow-up period (30).
Our study is further limited by the lack of information on whether
the sweetened beverages consumed were sweetened with sugar
(sucrose is the sweetener used in soft drinks in Sweden) or with
artiﬁcial (low-calorie) sweeteners such as aspartame. According to
food consumption data from a national survey conducted in
Sweden in 1997 (12), of the total consumption of soft drinks and
sweetened fruit drinks, low-calorie drinks represented 19.2% and
9.9% of consumption in women and men, respectively. A previous
study showed that both sugar-sweetened and low-calorie sodas
were associated with increased risk of stroke (8).

In conclusion, ﬁndings from this prospective cohort study suggest
that high consumption of sweetened beverages is associated with an
increased risk of stroke, particularly cerebral infarction. This ﬁnding
warrants conﬁrmation by other large studies.

OBJECTIVE
Despite their independent cardiovascular disease (CVD) advantages, effects of
a-linolenic acid (ALA), monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA), and low-glycemic-
load (GL) diets have not been assessed in combination. We therefore determined
the combined effect of ALA, MUFA, and low GL on glycemic control and CVD risk
factors in type 2 diabetes.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
The study was a parallel design, randomized trial wherein each 3-month treat-
ment was conducted in a Canadian academic center between March 2011 and
September 2012 and involved 141 participants with type 2 diabetes (HbA1c 6.5%–
8.5% [48–69 mmol/mol]) treated with oral antihyperglycemic agents. Participants
were provided with dietary advice on either a low-GL diet with ALA and MUFA
given as a canola oil–enriched bread supplement (31 g canola oil per 2,000 kcal)
(test) or a whole-grain diet with a whole-wheat bread supplement (control). The
primary outcome was HbA1c change. Secondary outcomes included calculated
Framingham CVD risk score and reactive hyperemia index (RHI) ratio.

RESULTS
Seventy-nine percent of the test group and 90% of the control group completed
the trial. The test diet reduction in HbA1c units of 20.47% (25.15 mmol/mol) (95%
CI 20.54% to 20.40% [25.92 to 24.38 mmol/mol]) was greater than that for the
control diet (20.31% [23.44 mmol/mol] [95% CI 20.38% to 20.25% (24.17 to
22.71 mmol/mol)], P = 0.002), with the greatest beneﬁt observed in those with
higher systolic blood pressure (SBP). Greater reductions were seen in CVD risk
score for the test diet, whereas the RHI ratio increased for the control diet.

CONCLUSIONS
A canola oil–enriched low-GL diet improved glycemic control in type 2 diabetes,
particularly in participants with raised SBP, whereas whole grains improved vas-
cular reactivity.

New pharmacological treatments for di-
abetes are required to be tested for car-
diovascular safety before licensing (1)
due to concerns over possible increased
cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in
some studies (2). Dietary strategies,
although less effective in improving
glycemic control, may have the advan-
tage of actually reducing CVD risk (3,4).
Low-glycemic-load (GL) diets have
been associated in cohort studies
with a reduction in both diabetes inci-
dence and CVD events (3–5), especially
in overweight individuals (3), and have
been recommended by many diabetes
associations (6–8). Monounsaturated
fatty acids (MUFAs) and short-chain-
length n-3 fatty acids (a-linolenic acid
[ALA]) reduced CVD risk in randomized
controlled trials (9,10). Furthermore,
high ALA and MUFA intake may also
lower the GL of the diet. An increased
proportion of vegetable oil calories in
the meal would be expected to reduce
postprandial glycemia both by decreas-
ing the carbohydrate content of the
meal and by delaying gastric emptying,
whereas the increase in vegetable oil
over the longer term would predict a re-
duction in serum lipids. This combined
dietary approach may therefore beneﬁt
both glycemia and CVD risk in diabetes.
Despite these possible advantages, the
effects of ALA and MUFA as part of a
low-GL diet have not been tested in
type 2 diabetes.

To determine the possible advantages
of this combination, we tested the effect
of a commonly used oil, canola oil, con-
taining both ALA (9.1%) and MUFA (63%)
when used as part of a low–glycemic in-
dex (GI) diet. This dietary intervention
was compared with a high-whole-grain–
cereal diet. Such whole-grain diets have
invariably been associated with a reduced
risk of diabetes (11,12) and CVD in cohort
studies (12–14), despite generally having
no effect on conventional CVD risk fac-
tors (15).

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
Participants
Participants were recruited from news-
paper, public transportation, and hospi-
tal clinic advertisements. One hundred
and forty-one participants were eligible
and randomized (Fig. 1). Recruitment
took place from 28 March 2011 to 17
September 2012, with the last study
visit on 4 December 2012. Eligible

participants had at least a 6-month his-
tory of type 2 diabetes based on clinical
criteria, were taking a stable dose of oral
antihyperglycemic agents for at least
the previous 2 months, and had HbA1c
values between 6.5% (48 mmol/mol)
and 8.5% (69 mmol/mol) both at the
initial screening and at the visit 1 week
before randomization (Fig. 1). No partic-
ipants had clinically signiﬁcant cardio-
vascular, renal (creatinine .150 mmol/L),
or liver (alanine aminotransferase level
more than three times the upper limit of
normal) disease or a history of cancer.
None were smokers, and alcohol intake
was two or fewer drinks a day for men
and one or fewer drinks a day for
women. Participation rate and reasons
for exclusion are given in Fig. 1.

Protocol
The study followed a randomized, parallel
design with two treatment arms of 3
months duration as follows: 1) a low-GL
diet with a canola oil–enriched bread pro-
vided as a supplement (test) or 2) a high
wheat-ﬁber diet emphasizing whole-
wheat foods (control). After stratiﬁcation
by sex and HbA1c .7.1% or #7.1% (54
mmol/mol) but without a predetermined
block size, participants were randomized
in a blinded fashion by a statistician who
was geographically separate from the
study center. The dietitians and partici-
pants could not be blinded, but equal
emphasis was placed on the potential
importance of both diets for health.
The analytical technicians, statistician,
and study investigators were blinded to
treatment up to and including the anal-
ysis of the primary outcome.

Participants attended the Risk Factor
Modiﬁcation Centre of St. Michael’s
Hospital, a teaching hospital of the Uni-
versity of Toronto, for screening and
weeks 21, 0, 2, 4, 8, 10, and 12 of the
study. They were weighed at each visit;
waist circumference was measured
while standing at the level of the umbi-
licus, and fasting blood samples were
taken at all visits except week 2. Seated
blood pressure was measured in tripli-
cate with an automatic sphygmoma-
nometer (Omron HEM 907 XL; Omron
Healthcare Inc., Burlington, ON, Canada)
and the mean taken. Seven-day food re-
cords covering the week before each
visit were discussed with the dietitian.
No speciﬁc exercise advice was given,
but participants were asked to keep

exercise constant. Baseline exercise rou-
tine was recorded and any subsequent
change noted. The study conformed to
the same general principles as other
studies of this duration run from the
center (16).

The study was approved by the re-
search ethics board of St. Michael’s
Hospital and the University of Toronto,
and written consent was obtained from
all participants. The study was regis-
tered with ClinicalTrials.gov (identiﬁer:
NCT01348568).

Dietary Interventions
The test diet included 4.5 slices of ca-
nola oil–enriched whole-wheat bread
(500 kcal/day) provided as a supple-
ment. The supplement delivered 31 g
canola oil or 14% of total dietary calories
of a 2,000-kcal diet (Supplementary Ta-
ble 1). The control diet included 7.5
slices of whole-wheat bread without ca-
nola oil per day (500 kcal) (Supplemen-
tary Table 1). Dietary advice on the test
diet emphasized low-GI foods, including
legumes, barley, pasta, parboiled rice,
and temperate-climate fruit, as outlined
in previous studies (17). For the con-
trol diet, participants were instructed
to avoid white-ﬂour products and re-
place them with whole-wheat breakfast
cereals, study breads, brown rice, and
so forth.

Dietary Assessment
Participants provided 7-day food re-
cords covering the previous 7 days be-
fore clinic visits. These records were
discussed with the dietitians for clariﬁ-
cation for future formal dietary analyses
and to indicate where further dietary
advice was required. The different na-
ture of the diets precluded blinding;
however, the advantages of both diets
were emphasized with reference to
their beneﬁts as recorded in the litera-
ture (11–14). Adherence to the diet was
assessed from the 7-day food records;
106 participants provided complete di-
etary records for the 3-month study.
Participants ranked their level of satiety
on a scale of 24 (starved/feeling weak)
to +4 (painfully full) and palatability of
study breads and diets at each visit on a
scale of 1–10 (1 = strongly dislike, 10 =
like very much).

Biochemical and Dietary Analyses
HbA1c, blood glucose, and serum lipids
were measured in the hospital routine

analytical laboratory by techniques as
previously described (17). The reactive
hyperemia index, as a marker of ﬂow-
mediated vasodilatation, was measured
with the EndoPAT system (Itamar Med-
ical Ltd., Franklin, MA), which assesses
the capillary blood reﬁll to ﬁnger tips
after a 5-min occlusion of the forearm
with a cuff inﬂated to 50 mmHg above the
participant’s resting systolic blood pres-
sure and expressed as a ratio of the blood
ﬂow in the opposite arm (18). Diet records
were analyzed using a computer program
(ESHA Food Processor SQL version 10.9;
ESHA, Salem, OR) based on U.S. Depart-
ment of Agriculture data (19) and interna-
tional GI tables (20) using the bread scale
(where bread = 100; for the glucose scale,
bread scale values were multiplied by
0.71) (21) (Supplementary Table 1).

Statistical Analyses
Results are expressed as mean 6 SEM
or 95% CI. Both the absolute and the

relative CVD risk score were calculated
using the Framingham risk equation for
total 10-year cardiovascular events (22),
in which only systolic blood pressure
and total and HDL cholesterol (HDL-C)
changed during the study. All patients
who met the inclusion criteria were in-
cluded in the analysis (n = 141). Week
0 HbA1c was taken as baseline, and
weeks 8, 10, and 12 were selected as
end of study to allow for stabilization
of HbA1c as the main outcome. Treat-
ment differences in physical and bio-
chemical measures were assessed from
all available data. The analysis of treat-
ment effect within a repeated-measures
study design used the mixed (random-
effects) linear model, with change from
baseline over time as the response vari-
able and diet (low-GL canola vs. wheat
bran) and time (weeks 8, 10, and 12) as
the main effects. Neither baseline nor
other covariates were used in the pri-
mary analysis, which was performed

with SAS 9.2 software (23). Within-
treatment changes for all variables were
estimated by the least squares means
technique within the mixed model.

Changes in medication use were as-
sessed either by two-tailed Fisher exact
test in the case of 2 3 2 tables or by the
Mantel-Haenszel test for larger contin-
gency tables. For the values used in Fig.
2 and associated Supplementary Table
2, multiple imputation using ﬁve sets
of randomly imputed values for missing
data was generated by PROC MI and ana-
lyzed by PROC MIXED, and the ﬁve sets of
results were pooled by PROC MIANALYZE
in SAS 9.2 (23).

We also assessed the interactions be-
tween the effect of diet on HbA1c and
the baseline measures of components of
the metabolic syndrome (waist circum-
ference, systolic and diastolic blood
pressure, HDL-C, fasting triglyceride
level, and blood glucose level) together
with the additional components of the

metabolic syndrome components (24) or
the median for CVD risk factor compo-
nents of the Framingham risk score (22).
The HbA1c data for upper and lower sys-
tolic blood pressure cut points are also
presented in graphic form (Fig. 2). The

for both raw and multiply imputed
data. To determine whether any baseline
measures affected the HbA1c response by
.10% and might thus be considered
a modiﬁer of the effect size, we under-
took a bivariate regression analysis of
HbA1c change (repeated measures) in-
volving baseline measures of predictors
suggested by the metabolic syndrome di-
agnostic criteria (6) and Framingham CVD
risk factors (3) by using one predictor at
a time.

Initially, we planned to recruit 120
participants. However, because of a
larger-than-expected dropout at the
start and to capture smaller effect sizes
seen in our more-recent studies, partic-
ipant recruitment numbers were in-
creased to 140 (16,25). On the basis of
data from a 12-week study in type 2 di-
abetes (16) from an ANCOVA model, we
would require 116 completers to
detect a treatment difference in HbA1c

change of 0.15% with an SD of 0.48%
[assuming a = 0.05, 1 2 b = 0.8, using
r = 0.8 to account for the high degree
of correlation between successive
measures (26)].

RESULTS
Fifty-ﬁve of 70 participants (79%) com-
pleted the test diet (i.e., provided at
least one blood sample in the ﬁnal
month), compared with 64 of 71 (90%)
on the control diet (Fig. 1). Of the 119
participants with data in the last month
(completers), 3 on the test diet and 7 on
the control diet were missing one or two
of the three ﬁnal values. The attrition
rates were not signiﬁcantly different be-
tween treatments (Fig. 1). No baseline
differences were seen (Table 1) except
for a higher baseline dietary GI in the
test group compared with the control
group (3 GI units [95% CI 1.1–4.9], P =
0.003) (Supplementary Table 3). The
test bread was rated more palatable
than the control bread, as was the over-
all test diet compared with the control
diet (Supplementary Table 3).

By design, the test diet resulted in
signiﬁcantly greater increases in MUFA
and ALA intake and corresponding lower
carbohydrate intake, and hence GL, rel-
ative to the control diet (Supplementary
Table 3). The relative GI and GL reduc-
tions for the test diet compared with the
control diet were 219 GI units (95% CI
220 to 217, P , 0.0001) and 252 GL
units (95% CI 259 to 245, P , 0.0001),
respectively, and compliance with the
test bread was 89% (95% CI 86%–93%)

versus the control bread 77% (95% CI
74%–80%) (P , 0.0001).

Glycemic Control and Body Weight
Oral antihyperglycemic medication dos-
ages increased in one and were reduced
in ﬁve participants on the test diet. They
decreased in four participants on the
control diet, with no signiﬁcant treat-
ment differences.

The mean HbA1c change was 20.47%
(25.15 mmol/mol) absolute HbA1c units
(95% CI 20.54% to 20.40% [25.92 to
24.38 mmol/mol], P , 0.001) for the
test diet and 20.31% (23.44 mmol/mol)
absolute HbA1c units (95% CI 20.38% to
20.25% [24.17 to 22.71 mmol/mol],
P , 0.001) for the control diet. The rel-
ative HbA1c reduction for the test diet
was 20.16% (21.71 mmol/mol) (95%
CI 20.25% to 20.06% [22.77 to 20.65
mmol/mol], P = 0.002) (Table 2) and re-
mained statistically signiﬁcant after ad-
justment for body weight change (P =
0.010). The body weight reductions
were similar at 22.1 kg and 21.6 kg
for both the test and the control diets,
respectively (Table 2). There was no sig-
niﬁcant treatment difference in waist cir-
cumference, although, as with body
weight, both treatments were associ-
ated with a reduction (waist circumfer-
ence 21.8 vs. 22.4 cm for test and
control diets, respectively) (Table 2).

Serum Lipids
Lipid-lowering medications were de-
creased in one participant on the test
diet and three on the control diet, with
no signiﬁcant treatment difference in

Data are mean 6 SD or n (%). RHI, reactive hyperemia index. *No signiﬁcant differences in baseline

medication use (P = 0.620). The test pro-
duced signiﬁcant falls within treatment
in total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol
(LDL-C), triglycerides, and the ratios of
total cholesterol:HDL-C and LDL-C:HDL-C
(Table 2). Relative to the control diet,
the test diet resulted in signiﬁcant reduc-
tions in total cholesterol (20.34 mmol/L
[95% CI 20.46 to 20.23], P , 0.0001),
LDL-C (20.25 mmol/L [95% CI 20.34

to 20.15], P , 0.0001), triglycerides
(20.14 mmol/L [95% CI 20.26 to
20.03], P = 0.018), and HDL-C (20.03
mmol/L [95% CI 20.06 to 0.00], P ,
0.041), albeit with still signiﬁcant reduc-
tions in the ratios of total cholesterol:
HDL-C (20.21 [95% CI 20.32 to 20.11],
P , 0.0001) and LDL-C:HDL-C (20.16
[95% CI 20.24 to 20.07], P = 0.001)
(Table 2).

Blood Pressure, Heart Rate, and
Reactive Hyperemia Index
No signiﬁcant treatment differences
were seen in blood pressure or heart
rate (Table 2). There was a nonsigniﬁ-
cant reduction in vascular reactivity for
the test diet but a nearly signiﬁcant rise
for the control diet, resulting in a rela-
tive increase in the reactive hyperemia
index for the control diet (20.24 [95% CI
20.42 to 20.06], P = 0.009) (Table 2).

CVD Risk
The Framingham risk score for CVD was
reduced for both treatments but signif-
icantly more for the test diet (20.6 [95%
CI 21.1 to 20.2], P = 0.008) (Table 2).

Effect of Baseline Metabolic Syndrome
Components and Framingham Risk
Score Components on HbA1c
Response
To determine whether participants at
higher risk beneﬁted more or less from
the intervention, we assessed the HbA1c
treatment effect for those with higher
versus lower baseline measures for
components of the metabolic syndrome
and Framingham risk score. In general,
the effect size and degree of signiﬁcance
was greatest in those whose baseline
measures were elevated (Supplemen-
tary Table 2). However, by multiple im-
putation for missing data, only for those
with higher systolic blood pressure
($130 mmHg) was the treatment differ-
ence signiﬁcantly different from those
with lower systolic blood pressure
(,130 mmHg). In participants with sys-
tolic blood pressure .130 mmHg, the
test diet HbA1c reduction was substan-
tial at 20.62% (26.79 mmol/mol) (95%
CI 20.77% to 20.47% [28.40 to 25.19
mmol/mol], P , 0.001) (Fig. 2 and Sup-
plementary Table 2). The treatment dif-
ference in HbA1c in those with systolic
blood pressure .130 mmHg (20.41%
[24.45 mmol/mol] [95% CI 20.62% to
20.19% (26.80 to 22.09 mmol/mol)],
P = 0.001) was more than ﬁve times the
treatment difference (P = 0.003) seen in
those with systolic blood pressure ,130
mmHg (20.07% [20.81 mmol/mol]
[95% CI 20.20% to 0.06% (22.22 to
0.60 mmol/mol)], P = 0.253) (Supple-
mentary Table 2).

To identify possible confounders, bi-
variate regression of HbA1c change on
baseline components of the metabolic
syndrome and Framingham risk score in-
dicated that only age was a signiﬁcant

independent predictor of HbA1c change
(P = 0.024), but the effect of the diet on
HbA1c remained signiﬁcant after con-
trolling for age. No baseline measures
contributed .10% to the HbA1c effect.

Adverse Events
There were no serious adverse events
that required hospitalization. Five par-
ticipants (three on the test diet and
two on the control diet) were examined
either by their family physician or at a
local hospital emergency department
for events unrelated to the diet. Five
subjects had repeated HbA1c values
.8.5% (69 mmol/mol) (three on the
control diet and two on the test diet).
Five participants (three on the control
diet and two on the test diet) reported
experiencing hypoglycemic episodes.

CONCLUSIONS
Increased MUFA and ALA (canola oil)
consumption as part of a canola low-GL
diet modestly lowered HbA1c but to a clin-
ically signiﬁcant extent in participants
with raised blood pressure. Together
with the reduction in Framingham risk
score, these data support the use of ca-
nola oil in type 2 diabetes.

This study is the ﬁrst to our knowl-
edge to combine three dietary strate-
gies (n-3 [ALA], MUFA, and low-GL
diets) to manage diabetes that in the
longer term have been associated with
reduced CVD risk both in people with
and without diabetes (3,4,9,10,27).

Previous meta-analyses of low-GI
studies in type 2 diabetes have dem-
onstrated a 0.43% reduction in HbA1c
(28), and large studies have reported
0.4%–0.5% (4.4–5.5 mmol/mol) HbA1c
reductions in their low-GI or -GL arm
(25) similar to that seen in the cur-
rent study. Recently, a major Spanish
trial demonstrated a 30% CVD risk
reduction after monounsaturated fat
or nut (including n-3 [ALA]–rich wal-
nuts) supplementation in high-risk trial
participants, including those with type
2 diabetes (27). Furthermore, three
meta-analyses of cohort studies indi-
cated cardioprotective properties of
low-GL diets in women without diabe-
tes (4,29,30). In other studies, partici-
pants with increased BMI and insulin
resistance but without diabetes demon-
strated greater effects of low-GL diets on
cardiovascular outcomes and weight loss,
respectively (3,31). The current study also

1812

Canola Oil and Glycemic Control in Diabetes

Diabetes Care Volume 37, July 2014

supports the concept of a greater effective-
ness of low-GL diets in insulin-resistant
states, including central adiposity, low
HDL-C, and hypertension (24).

Despite the relatively low statin-
treated LDL-C baseline concentrations
of 2.17–2.22 mmol/L, canola oil con-
sumption was associated with a signiﬁ-
cant additional reduction in LDL-C.
According to statin dose-response stud-
ies, the observed LDL-C reduction could
translate into an extra 7% reduction in
CVD events or an additional 20 mg ator-
vastatin (32). Earlier studies demon-
strated reduced triglyceride and VLDL
cholesterol levels with increased MUFA
intake in type 2 diabetes (33). To our
knowledge, the current study is one of
the ﬁrst to assess the effect on serum
lipids and glycemic control of an ALA-
rich oil in type 2 diabetes. The effects
of walnuts, as sources of ALA, have
been studied in type 2 diabetes, and de-
spite no effect on HbA1c, they were
shown to reduce LDL-C (34) and improve
vascular reactivity (35). In nondiabetic
study participants, walnut consumption
has also been associated with a reduc-
tion in LDL-C (36).

Increased whole-grain intake has con-
sistently been associated with reduced
CVD events in cohort studies (12,13)
without a clear mechanism for this ben-
eﬁt. Whole-wheat ﬁber is nonviscous,
and unlike viscous ﬁbers from oats, bar-
ley, and other sources, it does not lower
serum cholesterol (15,37) or reduce
postprandial glycemia (38). However,
there is evidence that whole-wheat
products may reduce insulin resistance
(39). Thus, this ﬁnding together with the
possible improvement in vascular reac-
tivity seen here after wheat bran intake
may be part of the explanation for the
reduced CVD risk among whole-grain
consumers (11–14,40).

A study limitation is the relatively
small effect size of HbA1c, the primary
outcome, of 0.5% (5.1 mmol/mol) com-
pared with the larger than previously
seen reduction for the control diet of
0.3% (3.4 mmol/mol). However, in par-
ticipants at increased risk for adverse
outcomes, a clinically signiﬁcant effect
was observed, especially in those with
hypertension, where the HbA1c reduc-
tion for the test diet was 0.62% (6.79
mmol/mol) and the relative HbA1c re-
duction was 0.41% (4.45 mmol/mol)
and, therefore, in the range of 0.3%–

0.4% and above that set by Food and
Drug Administration guidelines for dia-
betes drug development (1). Further-
more, the study participants were
already taking one or more oral antihy-
perglycemic agents, and 40% of the par-
ticipants had HbA1c levels at the clinical
target of #7.0% (53 mmol/mol).

The strengths of this study include the
participant numbers and frequency of
blood sampling that allowed small treat-
ment differences to be detected. Fur-
thermore, because the baseline HbA1c
and blood lipid levels were close to tar-
get, it is likely that there may be greater
reductions in participants with higher
levels commonly seen in clinical practice.
The signiﬁcance of differences have
been provided for both the raw data,
using repeated measures in the mixed
model, and also where missing values
have been derived by multiple imputa-
tion. Both approaches were similar in
identifying signiﬁcant differences. The
raw data, however, also show signiﬁcant
treatment differences, favoring higher
HDL-C, lower triglycerides, and lower
absolute coronary heart disease risk
for the test diet and indicate that older
and more centrally obese (increased
waist circumference) individuals re-
sponded better to the high-canola–
low-GL diet. These data support the
view that patients at greatest risk bene-
ﬁt most (3,24,31). The assessment using
multiply imputed data failed to reach
signiﬁcance for these differences.

In conclusion, the reduction of GL by
increasing the intake of MUFA and ALA
(e.g., canola oil) to displace dietary car-
bohydrates and reduce the GL improved
glycemic control, particularly in partici-
pants at high risk for diabetes complica-
tions, and reduced LDL-C, a feature not
seen with similar low-GI diets (25). By
contrast, whole-grain cereals appear to
improve vascular reactivity, possibly
helping to explain their beneﬁt in CVD
risk reduction.

Effects on Coronary Heart Disease of Increasing
Polyunsaturated Fat in Place of Saturated Fat: A
Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized
Controlled Trials

Abstract

Background:Reduced saturated fat (SFA) consumption is recommended to reduce coronary heart disease (CHD), but there
is an absence of strong supporting evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of clinical CHD events and few
guidelines focus on any specific replacement nutrient. Additionally, some public health groups recommend lowering or
limiting polyunsaturated fat (PUFA) consumption, a major potential replacement for SFA.

MethodsandFindings: We systematically investigated and quantified the effects of increased PUFA consumption, as a
replacement for SFA, on CHD endpoints in RCTs. RCTs were identified by systematic searches of multiple online databases
through June 2009, grey literature sources, hand-searching related articles and citations, and direct contacts with experts to
identify potentially unpublished trials. Studies were included if they randomized participants to increased PUFA for at least 1
year without major concomitant interventions, had an appropriate control group, and reported incidence of CHD
(myocardial infarction and/or cardiac death). Inclusions/exclusions were adjudicated and data were extracted independently
and in duplicate by two investigators and included population characteristics, control and intervention diets, follow-up
duration, types of events, risk ratios, and SEs. Pooled effects were calculated using inverse-variance-weighted random
effects meta-analysis. From 346 identified abstracts, eight trials met inclusion criteria, totaling 13,614 participants with 1,042
CHD events. Average weighted PUFA consumption was 14.9% energy (range 8.0%–20.7%) in intervention groups versus
5.0% energy (range 4.0%–6.4%) in controls. The overall pooled risk reduction was 19% (RR = 0.81, 95% confidence interval
[CI] 0.70–0.95, p = 0.008), corresponding to 10% reduced CHD risk (RR = 0.90, 95% CI = 0.83–0.97) for each 5% energy of
increased PUFA, without evidence for statistical heterogeneity (Q-statistic p = 0.13; I2 = 37%). Meta-regression identified
study duration as an independent determinant of risk reduction (p = 0.017), with studies of longer duration showing greater
benefits.

Conclusions: These findings provide evidence that consuming PUFA in place of SFA reduces CHD events in RCTs. This
suggests that rather than trying to lower PUFA consumption, a shift toward greater population PUFA consumption in place
of SFA would significantly reduce rates of CHD.

Introduction

Reduction in saturated fatty acid (SFA) consumption is
traditionally a major focus of dietary recommendations to reduce
coronary heart disease (CHD) risk. However, effects of such a
strategy on clinical CHD events are surprisingly poorly established
in both randomized controlled trials (RCTs) [1–8] and prospective
cohort studies [9]. Prior meta-analyses of RCTs have either
studied the effects of very heterogeneous dietary fat interventions
on very heterogeneous combinations of cardiovascular outcomes
[10], or studied effects of dietary fat interventions on intermediate
risk markers, such as blood lipids [11]. Furthermore, although
dietary guidelines often recommend reduction in SFA consump-
tion, such guidelines often do not highlight any specific nutrient as
preferable for replacing SFA in the diet [12–14], implying that any
macronutrient replacement (unsaturated fats, carbohydrate, or
protein) will produce similar effects.

(TC:HDL-C)

Consumption of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) lowers the
total:high-density lipoprotein cholesterol
ratio,
perhaps the best single lipid predictor of CHD risk [15], to a
greater extent than carbohydrate or any other major class of fatty
acids
[11]. PUFA consumption may also improve insulin
resistance [16,17] and reduce systemic inflammation [18–20].
These effects on risk factors suggest that PUFA may be an ideal
replacement for SFA in the population. However, surprisingly,
some scientists and organizations argue that consumption of n-6
PUFA, by far the predominant dietary PUFA, will actually
increase CHD risk and have recommended reduced consumption
[21–23], and the Institute of Medicine recommends only a
relatively modest range of 5%–10% energy (%E) consumption
from PUFA [24],
limiting its plausibility as a meaningful
replacement for SFA. Several controlled intervention trials have
evaluated whether increasing PUFA consumption, as replacement
for SFA, impacts risk of CHD events but results of these trials have
been inconsistent, with the majority of studies demonstrating no
significant benefits [1–8]. Thus, the demonstration of whether
replacing SFA with PUFA affects CHD outcomes and, if so, the
direction and magnitude of this effect are surprisingly understud-
ied matters of
scientific and public health importance. To
investigate and quantify this effect, we performed a systematic
review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled clinical trials
that assessed the impact of
increased PUFA consumption, as
replacement for SFA, on CHD endpoints.

Search Strategy

We searched for all RCTs that randomized adults to increased
total or n-6 PUFA consumption for at least 1 year without other
major concomitant interventions (e.g., blood pressure or smoking
control, other multiple dietary interventions, etc.), had an
appropriate control group without this dietary intervention, and
reported (or had obtainable from the authors) sufficient data to
calculate risk estimates with standard errors
for effects on
occurrence of ‘‘hard’’ CHD events (myocardial infarction, CHD
death, and/or sudden death). Studies were excluded if they were
observational or otherwise nonrandomized;

endpoints; or were commentaries, reviews, or duplicate publica-
tions from the same study. We did not restrict to primary or
secondary prevention trials, but included this as a prespecified
factor for assessment of heterogeneity. We included both feeding
trials and trials that utilized dietary advice; for both designs, the
average change in PUFA consumption was assessed. Searches
were performed of literature published through June 2009 using
MEDLINE, Embase, AGRIS, AMED, HMIC, PsycINFO,
Cochrane library, Web of Knowledge, CABI, CINAHL, confer-
ence abstracts (Zetoc), Faculty of 1,000, grey literature sources
(SIGLE), related articles, and hand-searching of reference lists.
Authors and experts were also directly contacted to identify
potentially unpublished trials and, when necessary, request missing
data or clarify methods or results.

A full list of search terms for all databases is available (see Text
S2 for Protocol). For example, for MEDLINE, search terms were
(‘‘Fatty Acids, Omega-6’’[Mesh] OR ‘‘unsaturated fatty acid’’

limited to humans, adults, and
clinical trials or RCTs; through June 2009 without other date or
language limitations. For other databases, search terms followed
similar concepts with variations based on the database structure.

Selection of Articles

Of 346 identified articles, 290 were excluded based upon review
of the title and abstract (Figure 1). Full texts of the remaining 54
manuscripts were independently assessed in duplicate by two
investigators to determine inclusion/exclusion. Forty-six studies
were excluded because they did not meet inclusion and exclusion
criteria (Table S1). The independent duplicate inclusion/exclusion
adjudications were 96% concordant on initial comparison. The
rare differences were resolved by group consultation among all
investigators, with unanimous consensus.

the latter were not available, they were directly calculated using
binomial tests of proportions, given that most studies reported RRs
rather than incidence rates; stronger findings were seen if SEs were
directly calculated using person-time at risk for two reports using
incidence rates (unpublished data). Differences in data extracted or
quality assessment scores between investigators were very unusual
and were resolved by consensus. Several different criteria have

been proposed for judging quality of randomized trials in meta-
analyses, although the validity and utility of different quality scores
has been debated [26]. We assessed study quality using the
validated Jadad scale [27], which includes criteria relating to
randomization, blinding, and withdrawals and dropouts that are
together summed to generate an overall quality score between 0
and 5. Following prior precedent [27], quality scores of 0–2
indicated lower-quality trials, and quality scores of 3–5 indicated
higher-quality trials.

Statistical Analysis

The overall pooled effect was calculated using random effects
meta-analysis, which accounts for heterogeneity in treatment
effects among studies, using the methods of Dersimonian and
Laird [28] with inverse-variance (SE) weighting. Heterogeneity
between studies was evaluated using the Dersimonian and Laird
Q-statistic, the I2 statistic, and meta-regression [28,29]. Potential
for publication bias was assessed by visually inspecting a funnel
plot of the treatment effect versus SE [30] and statistically using
the Begg adjusted-rank correlation test [31]. Prespecified potential
sources of heterogeneity were explored using stratified inverse-
variance weighted random effects meta-analysis and inverse-
variance weighted metaregression, including trial duration (, or
$ median for all
study population (primary versus
secondary prevention), and overall quality score (0–2 versus

trials),

3–5). We also performed post-hoc secondary analyses for CHD
mortality alone and total mortality, as well as based on selected
study characteristics, such as enrollment design (excluding trials
with open enrollment), extent of blinding, and type of dietary
intervention (provision of meals versus dietary advice). Analyses
were performed using STATA 10.1 (College Station, TX), with
two-tailed alpha ,0.05.

Results

The identified RCTs included a total of 1,042 CHD events
among 13,614 participants (Table 1) [1–8,32–34]. Average PUFA
consumption ranged from 4.0%E to 6.4%E (weighted mean 5.0%E)
in the control groups and from 8.0%E to 20.7%E (weighted mean
14.9%E)
in the intervention groups. Diet was assessed in the
majority of trials by either direct analysis of provided foods or by
multiple-day weighed diet records. Four trials evaluated secondary
prevention populations, three trials evaluated primary prevention
populations, and one trial evaluated a mixed population of
individuals with and without established CHD. Many of the trials
had design limitations,
inclusion of
electrocardiographically defined clinical endpoints, or open enroll-
ment. All trials utilized blinded endpoint assessment. Quality scores
were in the modest range and relatively homogeneous: all trials had
quality scores of either 2 or 3. Combining all trials, the pooled risk

reduction for CHD events was 19% (RR = 0.81, 95% CI 0.70–0.95,
p = 0.008) (Figure 2). Statistical evidence for substantial between-
study heterogeneity was not present (Q-statistic p = 0.13; I2 = 37%).
In evaluating potential for publication bias, the trial by Watts et al.
[8] was clearly a potential outlier both in terms of sample size and

overall pooled result: RR = 0.82, 95% CI 0.70–0.95; p heterogene-

Discussion

In this meta-analysis of RCTs, increasing PUFA consumption
as a replacement for SFA reduced the occurrence of CHD events
by 19%; each 5%E greater PUFA consumption reduced CHD risk
by 10%. Whereas nearly all these trials were insufficiently powered
to detect a significant effect
the pooled results
demonstrate a significant benefit of replacing PUFA for SFA on
clinical CHD events. Thus,
this is only the second dietary
intervention, together with consumption of long-chain omega-3
fatty acids
that has now been clearly
demonstrated to reduce cardiovascular events in RCTs.

without an appreciable reduction in HDL-C, producing a
lowering of the TC:HDL-C ratio by 0.16; this can be compared
to no significant change in the TC:HDL-C ratio when SFA is
replaced by carbohydrate [11]. In observational studies of adults
aged 40–59 y, each 1 unit lower TC:HDL-C is associated with
44% lower risk of CHD [15]. Based on these two sets of data, a
5%E increase in PUFA replacing SFA would be predicted, based
on TC:HDL-C effects alone, to reduce occurrence of CHD by 9%
(Figure 3). Thus, the 10% risk reduction for a 5%E increase in
PUFA replacing SFA demonstrated in the present meta-analysis of
RCTs of clinical CHD outcomes is remarkably consistent with

demonstrated lipid changes in short-term intervention trials to
epidemiologic associations between TC:HDL-C and CHD risk. A
slightly greater risk reduction in studies of CHD events, compared
with predicted effects based on lipid changes alone (Figure 3), is
consistent with potential additional benefits of PUFA on other
nonlipid pathways of risk such as insulin resistance [16,17] and
systemic inflammation [18–20]. Indeed,
these
additional benefits may be underestimated—the inevitable non-
compliance in long-term dietary trials would attenuate true
benefits, suggesting that
the 10% risk reduction for a 5%E
increase in PUFA in the present analysis may underestimate the
full effects. Additionally, our analysis of heterogeneity indicates

TC:HDL-C ratio in short-term trials (e.g., each 5%E of PUFA replacing SFA lowers TC:HDL-C ratio by 0.16) [11] coupled with observed associations
between the TC:HDL-C ratio and CHD outcomes in middle-aged adults (each 1 unit lower TC:HDL-C is associated with 44% lower risk of CHD) [15].
Evidence for effects of dietary changes on actual CHD events comes from the present meta-analysis of eight RCTs for PUFA replacing SFA and from
the Women’s Health Initiative RCT for carbohydrate replacing SFA (n = 48,835, ,3%E reduction in SFA over 8 years) [39]. Evidence for observed
relationships of usual dietary habits with CHD events comes from a pooled analysis of 11 prospective cohort studies [38].

that longer-term trials showed greater benefits, suggesting that
benefits of increasing PUFA consumption accrue over time.

the ranges of ages

When all trials were pooled, CHD risk was reduced by 24% for
each 1 mmol/l reduction in TC (95% CI 7%–38%). This finding
is consistent with results of observational studies of usual TC levels
and CHD risk. In a pooled analysis from 61 prospective cohort
studies including nearly 900,000 adults, each 1 mmol/l lower TC
was associated with 28% lower risk of CHD death in adults aged
60–69 (RR = 0.72, 95% CI 0.69–0.74) and 42% lower risk of
CHD death in adults aged 50–59 (RR = 0.58, 95% CI 0.56–0.61)
[15],
trials. A
long-term prospective
comparison of our findings to those of
observational studies of PUFA consumption is also informative.
The most robust evidence to date comes from a recent report of
pooled individual-level data from 11 cohort studies in America,
Europe, and Israel,
including 344,696 adults and 5,249 CHD
events [38]. Each 5%E of greater PUFA consumption, as a
replacement for SFA, was associated with 13% lower risk of CHD
(RR = 0.87, 95% CI 0.77–0.97) (Figure 3). Our finding in RCTs of
10% lower risk of CHD for each 5%E of greater PUFA
consumption, as a replacement for SFA, strongly supports both
the causality and magnitude of these observational findings.

included in the present

Because each of the RCTs in this meta-analysis tested the effects
of consuming PUFA in place of SFA, the present findings cannot
distinguish between potentially distinct benefits of
increasing
PUFA versus decreasing SFA. Thus, the present evidence alone
is insufficient to conclude that increasing PUFA in place of any
other nutrient will reduce CHD events. Notably, this evidence is
similarly insufficient to conclude that decreasing SFA in place of
any other nutrient will reduce CHD events. However, our findings
indicate that a strategy of replacing SFA with PUFA is likely to
reduce the occurrence of CHD.

(MUFA)

Other lines of evidence—in particular, findings from RCTs of
lipid risk factors and prospective cohort studies of CHD events—
can provide insights into whether benefits may be more strongly
related to reduced SFA, increased PUFA, or both. Based on either
the predicted effects on TC:HDL-C, the results of a large RCT
[39], or a pooled analysis of 11 prospective cohort studies [38],
replacement of SFA with carbohydrate does not lower CHD risk
(Figure 3). Evidence for CHD effects of replacing SFA with
monounsaturated fatty acids
is mixed (Figure 3);
randomized trials have not tested the effects of replacing SFA
with MUFA. Thus, the evidence is most consistent and robust for
CHD benefits when SFA is replaced with PUFA, rather than with
MUFA or carbohydrate, suggesting that lower risk may be more
strongly related to increased PUFA rather than decreased SFA
consumption. Recent ecological studies across nations over time
also support this contention, with changes in population CHD
mortality being most strongly related to increased consumption of
vegetable oils that contained PUFA, particularly the n-3 PUFA
alpha-linolenic acid, rather than decreases in animal
fats or
increases in overall vegetable consumption [40]. Further studies
are needed to evaluate the role of MUFA or protein as a
replacement for other macronutrients on risk of CHD.

The eight trials in this meta-analysis were performed and reported
with a relatively regular distribution over nearly three decades
between 1968 and 1992. This broad time span could increase
generalizability, and there is likely little reason to believe that the
biologic effects of PUFA have changed in recent years. The use of
random-effects meta-analysis allowed the pooling and estimation of
overall variance of different trials that may also each be estimating a
different ‘‘true’’ effect. All of these RCTs had blinded endpoint
ascertainment that would limit the magnitude of potential differential
(biased) assignment of types of events or causes of death.

Meta-analysis: PUFA Intake and CHD

Many of the identified randomized trials in our meta-analysis had
important design limitations (Table 1). For example, some trials
provided all or most meals, increasing compliance but perhaps
limiting generalizability to effects of dietary recommendations
alone; whereas other trials relied only on dietary advice, increasing
generalizability to dietary recommendations but likely underesti-
mating efficacy due to noncompliance. Several of these trials were
not double-blind, raising the possibility of differential classification
of endpoints by the investigators that could overestimate benefits of
the intervention. One trial used a cluster-randomization cross-over
design that intervened on sites rather than individuals; and two trials
used open enrollment that allowed participants to both drop-in and
drop-out during the trial. The methods for estimating and reporting
PUFA and SFA consumption in each trial varied, which could cause
errors in our estimation of
the quantitative benefit per %E
replacement. One of the trials also provided, in addition to the
main advice to consume soybean oil, sardines to the intervention
group [3], so that observed benefits may be at least partly related to
marine omega-3 PUFA rather than total PUFA consumption.
Several of the trials specified use of vegetable oils containing, in
addition to omega-6 PUFA, small amounts of the omega-3 PUFA
alpha-linolenic acid [2–5,8], although additional benefits of this
plant-derived omega-3, compared with seafood-derived omega-3,
are not yet clearly established [41].

Given these limitations of each individual trial, the quantitative
pooled risk estimate should be interpreted with some caution.
Nevertheless, this is the best current worldwide evidence from
RCTs for effects on CHD events of replacing SFA with PUFA,
and, as discussed above, the pooled risk estimate from this meta-
analysis (10% lower risk per 5%E greater PUFA) is well within the
range of estimated benefits from randomized controlled feeding
trials of changes in lipid levels (9% lower risk per 5%E greater
PUFA) and prospective observational studies of clinical CHD
events (13% lower risk per 5%E greater PUFA). The consistency
of the findings across these different lines of evidence provides
substantial confidence in both the qualitative benefits and also a
fairly narrow range of quantitative uncertainty.

As

in any meta-analysis, publication bias

is a potential
limitation. It seems unlikely that large dietary clinical trials would
have been performed and not reported without any knowledge of
the community of experts, and if smaller trials were performed and
unpublished, their addition would be unlikely to substantially alter
the pooled risk estimate given the numbers of subjects and events
currently included. Additionally, our direct contact with experts
minimized the possibility of missing unpublished studies. The
findings of this meta-analysis cannot be extrapolated to effects of
replacing SFA with carbohydrate or MUFA (Figure 3), which were
not evaluated in the present trials. Results should also not be
extrapolated to effects of increasing PUFA as replacement for
carbohydrate, although based on changes in TC:HDL-C in
feeding studies [11], and observed relationships with clinical events
in cohort studies [38,42], one would predict CHD benefit from
such replacement. Future trials should investigate these other
dietary interventions, in particular increasing PUFA consumption
as a replacement for carbohydrate and also MUFA.

This current meta-analysis of RCTs of clinical CHD events,
together with consistent findings from both prospective cohort
studies of clinical CHD events and RCTs of intermediate risk
factors, provides strong concordant evidence that consumption of
PUFA, in place of SFA, lowers CHD risk. Our findings have
several immediate implications. First, our results, together with
data from other research paradigms discussed above, indicate that
evidence-based population- and individual-level recommendations
to reduce SFA consumption should specify the importance of

replacement with PUFA. Second, because many of these trials
used vegetable oils containing small amounts of plant-derived n-3
PUFA in addition to omega-6 PUFA, our findings as well as those
of ecologic studies [40] would support
focus on n-3 PUFA-
containing vegetable oils, such as soybean or canola, to increase
population PUFA intake. For example, daily consumption of 20 g
soybean oil or 30 g canola oil, as an isocaloric replacement for
other macronutrients, would increase PUFA consumption by

findings
demonstrate reductions in CHD events, and no evidence for
increased risk, in long-term trials utilizing PUFA consumption at
very high levels (mean = 14.9%E, range 8.0%E –20.7%E). This
suggests that current recommendations for an upper limit of
PUFA consumption at 10%E [12–14] need to be revisited,
particularly as PUFA appears to be the primary evidence-based
replacement for SFA. Finally, whereas on a population-level even
a small shift from SFA to PUFA consumption would produce

the relatively modest
(,10% lower risk for 5%E

replacement) indicates a need for substantial policy focus on other
dietary risk factors for CHD [44], in particular high consumption
of salt and low consumption of seafood, whole grains, fruits, and
vegetables.

Editors’ Summary

Background. Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the leading
cause of death among adults in developed countries. It is
caused by disease of the coronary arteries, the blood vessels
that supply the heart with oxygen and nutrients. With age,
inflammatory deposits (atherosclerotic plaques) coat the
walls of these arteries and restrict the heart’s blood supply,
causing angina (chest pains that are usually relieved by rest),
shortness of breath, and, if these plaques rupture or break,
heart attacks (myocardial infarctions), which can reduce the
heart’s function or even be fatal. The key risk factors for CHD
are smoking, physical
inactivity, and poor diet. Blood
cholesterol
levels are altered by consuming dietary fats.
There are three main types of dietary fats—‘‘saturated’’ fatty
acids (SFA) and unsaturated fatty acids; the latter can be
‘‘mono’’ unsaturated (MUFA) or ‘‘poly’’ unsaturated (PUFA).
Eating SFA-rich foods (for example, meat, butter, and cheese)
increases the amount of LDL-C in the blood but also
increases HDL-C (the ‘‘good’’ cholesterol) and decreases
triglycerides. Eating foods that are rich in unsaturated fatty
acids (for example, vegetable oils and fatty fish) decreases
the amount of LDL-C and triglycerides in the blood and also
raises HDL-C.

Why Was This Study Done? Because of the connection
between eating SFA and high blood LDL-C levels, reduced
SFA consumption is recommended as a way to avoid CHD.
However, the evidence from individual randomized controlled
trials that have studied CHD events (such as heart attacks and
CHD-related deaths) have been mixed and could not support
this recommendation. Furthermore, dietary recommendations
to reduce SFA have generally not specified any replacement,
i.e., whether SFA should be replaced with carbohydrate,
protein, or unsaturated fats. Because of their beneficial effects
on blood LDL-C and HDL-C levels, PUFA could be one
important
for SFA, but, surprisingly, some
experts argue that eating PUFA could actually increase CHD
risk. Consequently, some guidelines recommend that PUFA
consumption should be limited or even reduced.
In this
systematic review (a study that uses predefined criteria to
identify all the research on a specific topic) and meta-analysis
(a statistical method for combining the results of several
studies) of randomized controlled trials, the researchers assess
the impact of increased PUFA consumption as replacement
for SFA on CHD events.

replacement

What Did the Researchers Do and Find? The researchers’
search of the published literature, ‘‘grey’’ literature (doctoral
dissertations, technical reports, and other documents not
printed in books and journals), and contacts with relevant
experts identified eight trials in which participants were

Meta-analysis: PUFA Intake and CHD

randomized to increase their PUFA intake for at least a year
and in which CHD events were reported. 1,042 CHD events
were recorded among the 13,614 participants enrolled in
these trials. In their meta-analysis, the researchers found that
on average the consumption of PUFA accounted for 14.9% of
total energy intake in the intervention groups compared with
only 5% of
total energy intake in the control groups.
Participants in the intervention groups had a 19% reduced
risk of CHD events compared to participants in the control
groups. Put another way, each 5% increase in the proportion
of energy obtained from PUFA reduced the risk of CHD events
by 10%. Finally, the researchers found that the benefits
associated with PUFA consumption increased with longer
duration of the trials.

What Do These Findings Mean? These findings suggest
that the replacement of some dietary SFA with PUFA reduces
CHD events. Because the trials included in this study looked
only at replacing SFA with PUFA, it is not possible from this
evidence alone to distinguish between the benefits of
reducing SFA and the benefits of
increasing PUFA.
Furthermore, the small number of trials identified in this
study all had design faults, so the risk reductions reported
here may be inaccurate. However, other lines of evidence
(for example, observational studies that have examined
associations between the fat intake of populations and their
risk of CHD) also suggest that consumption of PUFA in place
of SFA reduces CHD risk. Thus, in the light of these findings,
future recommendations to reduce SFA in the diet should
stress the importance of replacing SFA with PUFA rather than
with other forms of energy, and the current advice to limit
PUFA intake should be revised.

Meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies evaluating the association
of saturated fat with cardiovascular disease1–5

Patty W Siri-Tarino, Qi Sun, Frank B Hu, and Ronald M Krauss

ABSTRACT
Background: A reduction in dietary saturated fat has generally
been thought to improve cardiovascular health.
Objective: The objective of this meta-analysis was to summarize
the evidence related to the association of dietary saturated fat with
risk of coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke, and cardiovascular
disease (CVD; CHD inclusive of stroke) in prospective epidemio-
logic studies.
Design: Twenty-one studies identiﬁed by searching MEDLINE and
EMBASE databases and secondary referencing qualiﬁed for inclu-
sion in this study. A random-effects model was used to derive
composite relative risk estimates for CHD, stroke, and CVD.
Results: During 5–23 y of follow-up of 347,747 subjects, 11,006
developed CHD or stroke. Intake of saturated fat was not associated
with an increased risk of CHD, stroke, or CVD. The pooled relative
risk estimates that compared extreme quantiles of saturated fat in-
take were 1.07 (95% CI: 0.96, 1.19; P = 0.22) for CHD, 0.81 (95%
CI: 0.62, 1.05; P = 0.11) for stroke, and 1.00 (95% CI: 0.89, 1.11;
P = 0.95) for CVD. Consideration of age, sex, and study quality did
not change the results.
Conclusions: A meta-analysis of prospective epidemiologic studies
showed that there is no signiﬁcant evidence for concluding that
dietary saturated fat is associated with an increased risk of CHD
or CVD. More data are needed to elucidate whether CVD risks are
likely to be inﬂuenced by the speciﬁc nutrients used to replace
saturated fat.

INTRODUCTION

Early animal studies showed that high dietary saturated fat and
cholesterol intakes led to increased plasma cholesterol concen-
trations as well as atherosclerotic lesions (1). These ﬁndings were
supported by associations in humans in which dietary saturated
fat correlated with coronary heart disease (CHD) risk (2, 3). More
recent epidemiologic studies have shown positive (4–10), inverse
(11, 12), or no (4, 13–18) associations of dietary saturated fat with
CVD morbidity and/or mortality.

A limited number of randomized clinical interventions have
been conducted that have evaluated the effects of saturated fat on
risk of CVD. Whereas some studies have shown beneﬁcial effects
of reduced dietary saturated fat (19–21), others have shown no
effects of such diets on CVD risk (22, 23). The studies that
showed beneﬁcial effects of diets reduced in saturated fat
replaced saturated fat with polyunsaturated fat, with the impli-
cation that the CVD beneﬁt observed could have been due to an
increase in polyunsaturated fat or in the ratio of polyunsaturated

fat to saturated fat (P:S), a hypothesis supported by a recent
pooling analysis conducted by Jakobsen et al (24).

The goal of this study was to conduct a meta-analysis of well-
designed prospective epidemiologic studies to estimate the risk of
CHD and stroke and a composite risk score for both CHD and
stroke, or total cardiovascular disease (CVD), that was associated
with increased dietary intakes of saturated fat. Large prospective
cohort studies can provide statistical power to adjust for cova-
riates, thereby enabling the evaluation of the effects of a speciﬁc
nutrient on disease risk. However, such studies have caveats,
including a reliance on nutritional assessment methods whose
validity and reliability may vary (25), the assumption that diets
remain similar over the long term (26) and variable adjustment
for covariates by different investigators. Nonetheless, a summary
evaluation of the epidemiologic evidence to date provides im-
portant information as to the basis for relating dietary saturated
fat to CVD risk.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS

Study selection

Two investigators (QS and PS-T) independently conducted
a systematic literature search of the MEDLINE (http://www.ncbi.
nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/) and EMBASE (http://www.embase.com)
databases through 17 September 2009 by using the following
search terms: (“saturated fat” or “dietary fat”) and (“coronary” or
“cardiovascular” or “stroke”) and (“cohort” or “follow up”).

SIRI-TARINO ET AL

Studies were eligible if 1) data related to dietary consumption of
saturated fat were available; 2) the endpoints were nonfatal or
fatal CVD events, but not CVD risk factors; 3) the association of
saturated fat with CVD was speciﬁcally evaluated; 4) the study
design was a prospective cohort study; and 5) study participants
were generally healthy adults at study baseline. The initial
search yielded 661 unique citations, of which 19 studies met the
inclusion criteria and were selected as appropriate for inclusion
in this meta-analysis (Figure 1) (4–6, 8–11, 14–16, 18, 27–34).
All 4 investigators participated in the selection process (PS-T,
QS, FBH, and RMK). Additional reference searches were per-
formed by conducting a hand review of references from re-
trieved articles, and 3 more studies were identiﬁed (13, 17, 35).
Of the 22 identiﬁed studies, 10 studies provided data appropriate
to the constraints of this meta-analysis, speciﬁcally, relative risk
(RR) estimates for CVD as a function of saturated fat intake (10,
14–16, 28, 30–34). Where such data were not provided (n = 12),
data requests were made to investigators. Investigators from 6 of
the studies (4, 5, 8, 18, 29, 35) responded with the requested
data. A data set of the Honolulu Heart Study (9), obtained from
the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (36), was used to
derive the RR estimates for this study. Investigators from 5 studies
either did not respond or could no longer access data sets (6, 11,
13, 17, 27). However, 4 of 5 of these studies provided data for
saturated fat intake as a continuous variable (6, 11, 13, 17). For
these studies, we derived RR estimates (see Statistical analysis)
for categorical saturated fat intake and CHD and/or stroke. The
study by Boden-Albala et al (27) was excluded because the RR
estimate published did not correspond to the values given for the
upper and lower bounds of the CI, ie, using these values to
derive the SE resulted in different estimates, and the authors did
not respond to our attempts to obtain the correct data.

Altogether, this meta-analysis included data from 21 unique
studies, with 16 studies providing risk estimates for CHD and
8 studies providing data for stroke as an endpoint. Data were de-
rived from 347,747 participants, of whom 11,006 developed CVD.

Data extraction

Two authors (PS-T and QS) independently extracted and tab-
ulated data from each study using a standard extraction form.
Discrepancies were resolved via review of the original articles and
group discussion. From each study, we extracted information on
ﬁrst author, publication year, disease outcome, country of origin,
method of outcome ascertainment, sample size, age, sex, average
study follow-up time, number of cases, dietary assessment method
and the validity of the method, number of dietary assessments,
covariates adjusted, unit of measurement, RR of CVD comparing
extreme quantiles of saturated fat intake or per unit of saturated fat
intake, and corresponding 95% CIs, SEs, or exact P values.

Statistical analysis

RRs and 95% CIs were log transformed to derive corre-
sponding SEs for b-coefﬁcients by using Greenland’s formula
(37). Otherwise, we used exact P values to derive SEs where
possible. To minimize the possibility that the association for
saturated fat intake may be inﬂuenced by extreme values, we
contacted the authors of studies in which RRs were presented as
per-unit increments of saturated fat intake and requested RRs
comparing extreme quantiles. For studies for which we did not
receive responses, we used the published trend RRs comparing
the 25th and 75th percentiles to estimate RRs comparing high
with low dichotomized saturated fat intakes (38).

Meta-analyses were performed by using STATA 10.0 (Stata-
Corp, College Station TX) and Review Manager 5.0 (The Nordic
Cochrane Centre, The Cochrane Collaboration, Copenhagen,
Denmark; http://www.cc-ims.net/RevMan). P , 0.05 was con-
sidered statistically signiﬁcant. Random-effects models taking
into account both within-study and between-study variability
were used to estimate pooled RRs for associations of dietary
saturated fat with CHD risk. Relative to ﬁxed-effects models,
random-effects models were more appropriate for the current
study because test statistics showed evidence of heterogeneity
among these studies. When several RRs were given for subgroup
analyses within a single study, random-effects models were used
to pool the RRs into one composite estimate.

We used the STATA METAINF module to examine the in-
ﬂuence of an individual study on the pooled estimate of RR by
excluding each study in turn. We used the STATA METAREG
module to examine whether the effect size of these studies
depended on certain characteristics of each study, including age,
sex, sample size, duration of follow-up, whether disease out-
comes were conﬁrmed by medical record review, and a score
evaluating overall study quality. This quality score was derived
from the following information: dietary assessment method
(where 5 points were given for diet records, 4 for validated FFQs,
3 for FFQs that were not formally validated, 2 for diet history, and
1 for 24-h recall), number of dietary assessments, and number of
adjusted established risk factors for CVD. Points were totaled to
construct a composite quality score for each study.
We further conducted secondary analyses to examine age- and
sex-speciﬁc effects (ie, age ,60 y compared with 60 y and

male compared with female) of saturated fat on CVD risk. These
secondary analyses were performed with only those studies that
provided stratiﬁed data according to these variables.

To examine the effects of replacing saturated fat with car-
bohydrate or polyunsaturated fat, we performed secondary meta-
analyses with studies that provided pertinent and extractable data.
Because energy from carbohydrate intake was excluded in fully
adjusted models (including adjustments for total energy and
energy from protein and fats other than saturated fat) in 6 of 21
studies, the regression coefﬁcients of saturated fat could be
interpreted as the effects of isocalorically replacing carbohydrate
intake with saturated fat (25). Similarly, there were 5 studies (4, 9,
29, 31, 33) in which the regression coefﬁcients of saturated fat
could be interpreted as the effects of isocalorically replacing
polyunsaturated fat intake with saturated fat. Finally, because
consideration for total energy intake has been shown to be rel-
evant in the evaluation of nutrient-disease associations (39), we
also performed a subanalysis of studies (n = 15) that provided
total energy intake data (4, 6, 8–11, 15, 16, 18, 29–31, 33). Begg
funnel plots were used to assess potential publication bias (40).

RESULTS

The study design characteristics of the 21 studies identiﬁed by
database searches and secondary referencing that were included
in this meta-analysis (4–6, 8–11, 13–18, 28–35) are shown in

Table 1. Altogether, there were 16 studies that considered the
association of saturated fat with CHD and 8 studies that evalu-
ated the association of saturated fat with stroke. Dietary as-
sessments included 24-h recalls, food-frequency questionnaires
(FFQs), and multiple daily food records. The duration of follow-
up ranged from 6 to 23 y, with a mean and median follow-up of
14.3 and 14 y, respectively.

The baseline characteristics of the study participants are
provided in Table 2. The number of subjects in each study
ranged from 266 to 85,764. The age of participants ranged from
’30 to 89 y. There were 11 studies conducted exclusively in
men, 2 studies conducted exclusively in women, and 8 studies
that enrolled both men and women. There were 12 studies that
were conducted in North America, 6 in Europe, 2 in Japan, and
1 in Israel.

The level of adjustment for covariates varied according to
study (Table 3). Wherever possible, risk estimates from the
most fully adjusted models were used in the estimation of the
pooled RR. Studies that reported positive associations be-
tween saturated fat and CVD risk included the Lipid Research
Clinics Study (6), the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study
(4), the Health and Lifestyle Survey (5), the Strong Heart Study
(10), and studies by Mann et al (32) and Jakobsen et al (8).
Notably, these positive associations were speciﬁc to subsets of
the study population, ie, younger versus older (6, 8, 10), women
versus men (5, 8), or for some, but not all, CHD endpoints (4).

META-ANALYSIS OF SATURATED FAT AND CVD

543

Although the Strong Heart Study reported a positive association
between saturated fat and CVD in younger than in older in-
dividuals (ie, RR = 5.17; 95% CI: 1.6, 16.4), the fully adjusted
model that included adjustment for polyunsaturated fatty acids,
trans fats, and monounsaturated fatty acids was not statistically
signiﬁcant (RR = 2.98; 95% CI: 0.66, 13.6).

In contrast, a number of studies did not show signiﬁcant
associations of dietary saturated fat intake with CHD, including
the Western Electric Study (17), the Honolulu Heart Study (9),
the Ireland Boston Diet Heart Study (13), the Caerphilly Study
(28), the Framingham Heart Study (16), the Israeli Ischemic
Study (35), the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Study (15), the
Nurses’ Health Study (33), the Malmo Diet and Cancer Study
(14), and the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (18).

With respect to stroke, although inverse associations of sat-
urated fat intake with hemorrhagic stroke were reported in 2
studies (11, 30), no association between saturated fat and stroke
was found in 6 other studies (9, 14, 29, 31, 34, 35). The relation
of saturated fat with ischemic versus hemorrhagic stroke may
differ given their different biological mechanisms, and consid-
eration of these 2 disease states as distinct endpoints may be
important.

Individual study estimates as well as the overall estimate for
CHD, stroke, and CVD are shown in Figure 2. Saturated fat
intake was not associated with an elevated risk of CHD, stroke,
or CVD as a composite outcome. The RRs (95% CIs) were 1.07

(0.96, 1.19) for risk of CHD, 0.81 (0.62, 1.05) for risk of stroke,
and 1.00 (0.89, 1.11) for overall CVD risk. Two of the 8 studies
included in the meta-analysis related to stroke examined hem-
orrhagic stroke exclusively (30, 31). When these 2 studies were
excluded from the meta-analysis, the pooled RR (95% CI) was
0.86 (0.67, 1.11).

We documented heterogeneity among studies that examined
saturated fat in relation to CHD (P = 0.04) or stroke (P = 0.01).
However, age (P = 0.16 for CHD, 0.40 for stroke), sex (P = 0.52
for CHD, 0.25 for stroke), sample size (P = 0.44 for CHD, 0.71
for stroke), duration of follow-up (P = 0.53 for CHD, 0.42 for
stroke), medical record review for CVD outcome conﬁrmation
(P = 0.17 for CHD, 0.30 for stroke), and study quality as as-
sessed by a quality score (P = 0.62 for CHD, 0.70 for stroke)
could not explain this heterogeneity. Quality scores for each
study are provided in Supplementary Table 1 (see “Supple-
mental data” in the online issue).

No individual study had a particularly large inﬂuence on the
pooled estimate of RR for CVD, although Gillman et al’s (11) and
Boniface and Tefft’s (5) studies had relatively stronger effects on
the overall RR estimate than did other studies. The pooled RRs
for CVD were 1.03 (95% CI: 0.93, 1.14) after excluding Gillman
et al and 0.97 (95% CI: 0.88, 1.08) after excluding Boniface and
Tefft. When these 2 studies were excluded simultaneously, the
pooled RRs (95% CI) were 1.02 (0.94, 1.11) for CHD, 0.86 (0.65,
1.14) for stroke, and 1.00 (0.92, 1.10) for CVD, respectively.

SIRI-TARINO ET AL

Subgroup analyses evaluating the association of saturated fat
with CVD by sex or age (, or  60 y) showed no signiﬁcant
associations (see Supplementary Figures 1 and 2, respectively,
under “Supplemental data” in the online issue). In men, the
pooled RR (95% CI) of CVD in relation to saturated fat intake
was 0.97 (0.87, 1.08), whereas in women this ﬁgure was 1.06
(0.86, 1.32). The associations for saturated fat
intake were
similar between participants who were younger than 60 y at
baseline and those who were older: the pooled RRs (95% CIs)
were 0.98 (0.84, 1.13) and 0.98 (0.86, 1.10), respectively. Fur-
ther stratiﬁcation by both age and sex (ie, men or women
younger than 60 y and men or women older than 60 y) also
showed no signiﬁcant associations between saturated fat and
CHD risk, although sample size may have been inadequate for
these analyses (see Supplementary Figures 3 and 4, respectively,
under “Supplemental data” in the online issue). The limited
number of studies excluded our ability to further stratify the
analysis by study outcome.

Of 21 studies, 15 studies adjusted for total energy intake in the
fully adjusted model. Secondary analyses conducted within these
studies showed results largely similar to the primary analysis (see
Supplementary Figure 5 under “Supplemental data” in the on-
line issue). Six studies further adjusted for energy from other
fats and protein, but left energy from carbohydrate out of the
fully adjusted model. In these studies, the pooled RR (95% CI)
was 0.98 (0.86, 1.13) for CHD, 0.93 (0.71, 1.21) for stroke, and
0.97 (0.86, 1.10) for overall CVD (see Supplementary Figure 6
under “Supplemental data” in the online issue). Similarly, 5
studies adjusted for energy from carbohydrate, protein, and fats
but not polyunsaturated fat. The pooled RR (95% CI) for these
studies was 1.07 (0.91, 1.25) for CHD, 0.95 (0.81, 1.13) for
stroke, and 1.02 (0.92, 1.14) for overall CVD (see Supplemen-
tary Figure 7 under “Supplemental data” in the online issue).

A funnel plot of the 21 studies that evaluated the association of
saturated fat with CVD is provided in Figure 3. The larger
studies at the top of the plot were somewhat more symmetrically
distributed than were the smaller studies at the bottom. This
suggests the heterogeneity of the study estimates as well
as possible publication bias favoring studies with signiﬁcant
results.

DISCUSSION

This study sought to evaluate the effects of dietary saturated fat
on CVD risk by summarizing the data available from informative
epidemiologic studies and including, where possible and rele-
vant, supplementary information that had been provided on
request from investigators of the component studies. The con-
glomeration of data from 16 studies with CHD as an endpoint and
8 studies with stroke as the endpoint showed no association of
dietary saturated fat on disease prevalence after adjustment for
other nutrients wherever possible. Evaluation of the subset of
studies (n = 15) that adjusted for total energy, which has been
shown to be relevant in evaluating nutrient-disease relations
(39), yielded similar ﬁndings. This study had several strengths,
including the selection of prospective epidemiologic studies that
statistically adjusted for relevant covariates and the inclusion of
large studies with a signiﬁcant number of incident cases. Fur-
thermore, the use of the random-effects model in our analyses
allowed for the heterogeneity of variance between studies.

A caveat of this study was its reliance on the accuracy of the
dietary assessments of the component studies, which may vary
depending on the method used (25). Underreporting of calories
has often contributed to the error associated with dietary
assessments, particularly in overweight individuals. Generally, 4-
to 7-d food records are considered to be the most accurate means
of dietary assessment, but such methods are generally not feasible
in large cohort studies. A single 24-h recall is relatively easy to
collect, but the information does not reﬂect long-term dietary
patterns. FFQs have become the method of choice in large ep-
idemiologic studies because they are inexpensive and can assess
long-term diets (25); however, this method is also subject to
random and systematic errors.

As part of a quality score, the method of nutrient assessment
was taken into account, and the risk estimates that each study
contributed were adjusted based on this quality score, which also
considered whether the dietary assessment method had been
validated or repeatedly performed as well as the number of
covariates included in the model. The latter criterion assumed
that investigators included all relevant covariates in their re-
gression models. Evaluation of the studies on the basis of this
quality score did not change the ﬁndings of this meta-analysis.
Only a limited number of studies provided data that enabled
the evaluation of the effects of isocalorically replacing saturated
fat with carbohydrate or polyunsaturated fat, and, as such, the
statistical power was diminished for the secondary analyses
restricted to these studies. Most recently, however, an analysis
conducted in a pooled cohort of studies showed a lower CHD risk
when saturated fat was replaced with polyunsaturated fat and
increased nonfatal myocardial infarction, but not fatal CHD, risk
when saturated fat was replaced with carbohydrate (24).

Inverse associations of polyunsaturated fat and CVD risk have
previously been reported (41, 42). Replacement of 5% of total
energy from saturated fat with polyunsaturated fat has been
estimated to reduce CHD risk by 42% (43). Notably, the amount
of dietary polyunsaturated fat in relation to saturated fat (ie, the P:
S ratio) has been reported to be more signiﬁcantly associated with
CVD than saturated fat alone, with a reduced CHD risk found
with P:S ratios  0.49 (44). Only 1 of the 21 studies that met
criteria for inclusion in this meta-analysis evaluated the relation
of the P:S ratio with CHD (14). No effect was seen in this study,

in which the average P:S ratio was ’0.4, nor was there an as-
sociation of P:S ratio with CVD in the Israeli Ischemic Heart
Study (U Goldbourt, personal communication, 2008). However,
these studies were relatively small.

Of note, in intervention trials that have shown protective
effects of reducing saturated fat, ie, the Veteran Affairs (19), Oslo
Diet Heart (20), and Finnish Mental Hospital (21) studies, the
calculated P:S ratios ranged from 1.4 to 2.4—values that are
much higher than the threshold of 0.49 above which CHD risk has
been reported to be reduced (44). Relatively high P:S ratios
(1.25–1.5) were also observed in the Anti-Coronary Club Study,
an early trial that showed beneﬁcial effects of a lower fat diet (30–
32% of total energy) (45). The presumed beneﬁcial effects of
diets with reduced saturated fat on CVD risk may therefore be
dependent on a signiﬁcant increase in polyunsaturated fat in the
diet. Existing epidemiologic studies and clinical trials support
that substituting polyunsaturated fat for saturated fat is more
beneﬁcial for CHD risk than exchanging carbohydrates for
saturated fat in the diet, as described further elsewhere (46).

With respect to dietary carbohydrate, the type of carbohydrate
(ie, a high or low glycemic index) that replaces saturated fat is
likely important in inﬂuencing dietary effects on CVD risk
(47). However, there was insufﬁcient information in the com-
ponent studies of this meta-analysis to permit examination of
this issue.

Our results suggested publication bias, such that studies with
signiﬁcant associations tended to be received more favorably for
publication. If unpublished studies with null associations were
included in the current analysis, the pooled RR estimate for CVD
could be even closer to null. Furthermore, despite several indi-
cations in the published literature that sex and age may modify
the association of saturated fat with CHD (5, 6, 8, 10), we did not
observe effects of these variables on CHD risk. The lack of an
association may have been related to limited statistical power.
Although an inverse association of saturated fat with stroke
risk has been previously described (48), saturated fat intake was
not signiﬁcantly associated with risk of stroke in the current meta-
analysis. The exclusion of 2 studies conducted in Japan (30, 34),
where saturated fat intake is known to be signiﬁcantly lower than
in Western populations, did not substantially change the RR
estimate (RR = 0.90; 95% CI: 0.70, 1.15). The exclusion of 2
studies that evaluated hemorrhagic stroke speciﬁcally (30, 31)
also did not alter the RR estimate; however, these ﬁndings were
likely limited by statistical power.

In conclusion, our meta-analysis showed that there is in-
sufﬁcient evidence from prospective epidemiologic studies to
conclude that dietary saturated fat is associated with an increased
risk of CHD, stroke, or CVD. However, the available data were
not adequate for determining whether there are CHD or stroke
associations with saturated fat in speciﬁc age and sex subgroups.
Furthermore, there was insufﬁcient statistical power for this
meta-analysis to assess the effects on CVD risk of replacing
speciﬁc amounts of saturated fat with either polyunsaturated fat
or carbohydrate. Finally, nutritional epidemiologic studies pro-
vide only one category of evidence for evaluating the relation of
saturated fat intake to risk for CHD, stroke, and CVD. An overall
assessment requires consideration of results of clinical trials as
well as information regarding the effects of saturated fat on
underlying disease mechanisms, as discussed elsewhere in this
issue (46).

The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to summarize the evidence from observational studies assessing the
association between intake of trans fatty acids (TFA) and the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD), with a specific emphasis on
distinguishing between TFA of industrial and ruminant origin. By searching five bibliographic databases, analyses from six
published and two unpublished prospective cohort studies, assessing the association of intake of TFA with fatal and/or non-fatal
CHD, were identified. Four and three studies reported separate associations for intake of ruminant or industrial-TFA, respectively.
The pooled relative risk estimates for comparison of extreme quintiles of total-TFA intake (corresponding to intake
increments ranging from 2.8 to B10 g/day) were 1.22 (95% confidence interval: 1.08–1.38; P¼ 0.002) for CHD events and
1.24 (1.07–1.43; P¼ 0.003) for fatal CHD. Ruminant-TFA intake (increments ranging from 0.5 to 1.9 g/day) was not significantly
associated with risk of CHD (risk ratio (RR)¼ 0.92 (0.76–1.11); P¼ 0.36), and neither was industrial-TFA intake, although there
was a trend towards a positive association (RR¼ 1.21 (0.97–1.50); P¼ 0.09). In conclusion, our analysis suggests that industrial-
TFA may be positively related to CHD, whereas ruminant-TFA is not, but the limited number of available studies prohibits any
firm conclusions concerning whether the source of TFA is important. The null association of ruminant-TFA with CHD risk may be
due to lower intake levels.

Introduction

Dietary trans fatty acids (TFA) have long been suspected
of increasing the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD),
especially at high intake levels (Willett et al., 1993). No
randomized intervention studies evaluating the effect of
dietary TFA on hard end points for CHD have been
conducted. However, as several epidemiological studies have
shown a strong positive association between the intake of
TFA and risk of CHD (Pietinen et al., 1997; Oomen et al.,
2001; Oh et al., 2005), the suspicion of a harmful effect of
TFA seems justified. It has been estimated that a 2% increase

in energy intake from TFA is associated with a 23% increased
risk of CHD in a previous pooled analysis of four prospective
cohort studies with nearly 140 000 subjects (Mozaffarian
et al., 2006).

However, TFA is not just TFA. TFA in food originate from
two main sources; industrial partial hydrogenation of edible
oils, and bacterial hydrogenation of unsaturated fatty acids
in the rumen of ruminants. Today, the industrially produced
TFA (IP-TFA) are primarily found in snacks and fast food
products whereas the ruminant-TFA (R-TFA) constitute a part
of the fat in meat and dairy products. The isomer distri-
bution of the TFA from these two sources is dissimilar.
In R-TFA the predominant isomer is vaccenic acid (t18:1n-7),
whereas IP-TFA generally has a Gaussian distribution of
t18:1 isomers with highest levels of elaidic acid (t18:1n-9)
(Wolff et al., 1998).

There has been debate as to whether R-TFA is equally
harmful as IP-TFA. Some results from epidemiological studies
of intake of R-TFA and risk of CHD have indicated that intake

of R-TFA is innocuous or even protects against CHD
(Jakobsen et al., 2008).

We found it fitting and timely to conduct a systematic
review and meta-analysis to assess the empirical evidence of
an association between intake of TFA and the risk of fatal
and/or non-fatal CHD, with a specific emphasis on stratify-
ing results according to industrial or ruminant origin of the
TFA. We aimed for inclusion of all the available prospective
cohort studies, which have assessed the association between
intake of TFA and incident CHD in adult populations.

Subjects and methods

We conducted this review in accordance with the PRISMA
Statement for Reporting Systematic Reviews and Meta-
Analyses of Studies That Evaluate Health Care Interventions
(Liberati et al., 2009) on the basis of a predefined protocol,
which was made publicly available and distributed among
interested parties.

Study selection

With this work, we aimed to review all prospective cohort
studies describing the association between intake of TFA
(industrial and/or ruminant) and the incidence of fatal and
non-fatal CHD. We conducted a systematic literature search
of MEDLINE via Pubmed from 1950 to March 2010; EMBASE
via Ovid from 1980 to March 2010; Food Science and
Technology Abstracts via Ovid from 1969 to March 2010;
Web of Science from 1900-14 to March 2010, and SciFinder
Scholar for studies describing the association between TFA
intake and incidence of CHD. Two search themes were
combined: TFA intake and CHD mortality and morbidity
(for detailed description of the search strategy please refer
to Supplemental Appendix A). The search strategy had no
language or study design restrictions. Instead, prospective
cohort studies were identified from titles and abstracts of the
retrieved references. Additionally, we screened the reference
lists of all identified relevant studies, and of review articles,
in order to identify possible studies of interest. We contacted
authors of included studies for references to studies not
identifiable by our other searches, including unpublished
studies.

(NTB,

investigator, and EMB, Senior
Researcher in Biophysics and Research Librarian DB) inde-
pendently identified articles eligible for further review by
screening of identified titles and abstracts. Articles were
considered for inclusion in the meta-analysis if they reported
data from an original prospective cohort study with an
assumed healthy study population of adult men and/or
women at study baseline. Studies had to assess intake of one
or all of IP-TFA, R-TFA and TFA from any source (total-TFA),
and one of the outcomes had to be the incidence of fatal
myocardial infarction, non-fatal myocardial infarction or

total CHD-related deaths. Studies were included for further
screening if one or both reviewers decided the study to
be possibly eligible. The second screening was based on
reading of the full-text versions. Any disagreement between
reviewers was resolved by consensus.

Data extraction

The included studies were scrutinized and reviewed without
blinding of reviewers. One investigator (NTB) was respon-
sible for the extraction of data, which was then checked by
another reviewer (RC). Data were extracted using a custo-
mized data extraction form. Relevant data included the first
author’s name, year of publication, baseline year, name of
cohort, country of origin, number of participants (men and
women) at baseline, participant eligibility criteria, age of
participants, duration of
follow-up, dietary assessment
method and validity of the method, number of dietary
assessments, TFA mean or median intake and extreme
quantiles of intake, outcome assessment method, number
of events, unit of measurement, confounders adjusted for in
the statistical analysis, relative risks of CHD (from the most
adjusted analysis) comparing extreme quantiles of TFA
intake or per unit of TFA intake, and corresponding 95%
confidence intervals (CIs).

Statistical analysis

The most adjusted risk ratio (RR) was used as a measure of the
association between TFA and CHD. Summary estimates were
obtained using inverse variance random-effects meta-analy-
sis, with the DerSimonian and Laird estimate of the variance
t2 as a measure of heterogeneity between trials (Dersimonian
and Laird, 1986). We applied random-effects, rather than
fixed-effects models to estimate pooled RRs in order to
take into account the heterogeneity, however small, of the
risk estimates and thereby be more conservative. Meta-
analyses were performed by using Review Manager 5.0
(The Nordic Cochrane Centre, The Cochrane Collaboration,
Copenhagen, Denmark; http://www.cc-ims.net/RevMan). We
assessed homogeneity of effects across studies using the Q-test
and quantified by I2 index (Higgins and Thompson, 2002),
which represents the percentage of total variation across
studies that is attributable to inconsistency (heterogeneity)
rather than chance (Higgins et al., 2003).

In accordance with the protocol, we performed secondary
analyses for intake of R-TFA and IP-TFA, respectively. Sample
size was inadequate for analyses stratifying for sex.

We examined the influence of an individual study on
the pooled estimate of RR by excluding each study in turn.
We specified sensitivity analyses with the aim to evaluate
the influence of study quality on effect estimates as follows:
(1) an analysis stratifying for the dietary assessment tool
(diet records, validated food frequency questionnaire (FFQ),

non-validated FFQ, diet history, 24-h recall) where the
former was rated as better; (2) a meta-regression-analysis to
examine if the number of confounders adjusted for in each
study affected the effect size; and (3) a meta-regression-
analysis to examine if the number of stars obtained in
the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale quality assessment affected the
effect size. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale is one of the more
comprehensive instruments for assessing the quality of
non-randomized studies in meta-analyses (Wells et al.,
2009). The eight-item instrument consists of three subscales,
namely, selection of subjects (four-item), comparability of
subjects (one-item) and assessment of outcome/exposure
(three-item). For each item, each study got a score of zero,
one or two stars, with a maximal total score of nine stars.

Results

A total of 257 unique references were identified through the
literature search and an additional 12 from reference lists,
giving a total of 269. Of these, only eight met the selection
criteria as shown in Figure 1. Three publications presented

results from the Nurses’ Health Study (NHS) after 8, 14 and
20 years of follow-up, respectively (Willett et al., 1993;
Hu et al., 1997; Oh et al., 2005). Since only the first
publication (Willett et al., 1993) presented analysis of the
association of IP-TFA and R-TFA intake with CHD, we
extracted these data from this publication. For results on
the association of total-TFA intake with CHD, we extracted
data from the publication with the longest follow-up of
20 years (Oh et al., 2005). One of the selected studies, the
Strong Heart Study (SHS) included subjects who were diagnosed
with diabetes at baseline and adjusted for diabetes status in
the statistical analyses (Xu et al., 2006). We contacted the
authors of all the selected studies to request updated analysis
or additional information. The author of one study was able
to respond to our request (Jakobsen et al., 2008).

In addition, we contacted the principal investigators of
five prospective cohort studies who had not published data
on the association between TFA intake and CHD despite
having collected relevant data. The principal investigators of
the Va¨sterbotten Intervention Program (Hallmans et al., 2003)
and the Womens’ Health Study (Liu et al., 2002) could not
accommodate our request and the reporting of TFA intake
data was judged to be of inadequate quality by the principal
investigators of the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study
(Folsom et al., 1997). The Iowa Womens’ Health Study (IWHS)
performed a relevant analysis on our request (Personal
Communication with Dr Kim Robien) and the principal
investigators of the Finnish Mobile Clinic Health Examination
Survey (FMC) provided us with the results of an unpublished
analysis (Personal Communication with Dr Paul Knekt).
Thereby, data from seven peer-reviewed articles were
included in this review (Willett et al., 1993; Ascherio et al.,
1996; Pietinen et al., 1997; Oomen et al., 2001; Oh et al.,
2005; Xu et al., 2006; Jakobsen et al., 2008) as well as
unpublished data from two prospective cohort studies.

The study design characteristics of the nine studies are
presented in Table 1. Seven studies evaluated the association
of total-TFA intake with fatal and/or total CHD (Ascherio
et al., 1996; Pietinen et al., 1997; Oomen et al., 2001; Oh
et al., 2005; Xu et al., 2006) (IWHS and FMC, unpublished);
four examined the association of R-TFA with fatal or total
CHD (Willett et al., 1993; Pietinen et al., 1997; Oomen et al.,
Jakobsen et al., 2008) and three considered the
2001;
association of IP-TFA with fatal or total CHD (Willett et al.,
1993; Pietinen et al., 1997; Oomen et al., 2001). The studies
included from 667 to 78 778 participants who were followed
for periods ranging from 6 to 21 years. Three studies
included only men, three studied only women and three
studies both men and women. The published studies’ quality
was given a rating of 6 to 8 (out of 9) when assessed by the
Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (Supplementary Table 1). Different
methods for assessing dietary TFA were applied in the
included studies: five used validated FFQs, one used 7-day
weighed food records, two used the dietary history method,
and one study used single 24-h recalls. Only one study
performed repeated dietary assessments (Oh et al., 2005).

The risk estimates for the most fully adjusted analysis
for the individual studies are presented in Table 2, and the
covariates adjusted for in Table 3. The number of covariates
ranged from 8 to 22.

individual

risk estimates for
We pooled the individual studies’
comparison of extreme quintiles of
total-TFA intake
(Figure 2a) and found that total-TFA intake was associated
with an increased risk of CHD events of 22 % (RR¼ 1.22; 95%
CI: 1.08, 1.38; P¼ 0.002) and an almost similar risk of fatal
CHD (RR¼ 1.24; CI: 1.07, 1.43; P¼ 0.003). The risk estimates
for
corresponded to variable
intake spans of total-TFA ranging from 2.8 g/day to 4 E%
(or B10 g/day). Yet, there was no indication of heterogeneity
between the studies; the I2-value was below 15% for both
analyses. When omitting the two unpublished studies, the
risk estimate for fatal CHD changed to RR¼ 1.37 (95% CI:
1.13, 1.68; P¼ 0.002), and when omitting the study that
included subjects diagnosed with diabetes at baseline
(Xu et al., 2006), the effect estimates increased modestly
to 1.25 (CI: 1.09–1.45; P¼ 0.002) and 1.26 (CI: 1.09–1.47;
P¼ 0.003) for total and fatal CHD, respectively.

for

reported estimates

(RR¼ 0.93; CI: 0.74–1.18; P¼ 0.56;

There was no significant association between R-TFA intake
and risk of CHD events when pooling all available estimates
for risk associated with increasing R-TFA intake (one study
compared extreme quintiles of intake (Willett et al., 1993),
and two studies
increments of
0.5 g/day (Jakobsen et al., 2008) or 0.5 E% (Oomen et al.,
2001))
Figure 2b).
Inclusion of one study evaluating the risk of fatal CHD
(comparing extreme intake quintiles (Pietinen et al., 1997))
did not change this estimate (RR¼ 0.92; CI: 0.76–1.11;
P¼ 0.36). The test for heterogeneity was not significant and
the risk estimates for the individual studies corresponded to in
R-TFA intake increments ranging from 0.5 to 1.9 g/day (Table 2).
Only three studies assessed the CHD risk associated with
intake of IP-TFA. The pooled effect estimate suggested that
IP-TFA intake increases the risk of CHD, although this
association did not reach statistical significance (RR¼ 1.21;
CI: 0.97–1.50; P¼ 0.09; Figure 2c). There was an indication of
heterogeneity between the studies in this analysis (I2¼ 66%;
P¼ 0.05), which was reduced when omitting the study of
women only (I2¼ 29%; P¼ 0.23) whereby also the effect
estimate changed (RR¼ 1.09; CI: 0.98–1.22; P¼ 0.12). The
risk estimates for the individual studies corresponded to
IP-TFA intake increments ranging from B1.3 g/day (0.5 E%)
to 5.0 g/day (Table 2).

To address whether one single study carried most of
the effect, we examined the influence of an individual study
on the pooled RR estimate by excluding each study in
turn. When the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer
Prevention Study (AT/BC) was omitted from the pooled
analysis of the risk of fatal CHD associated with intake of
total-TFA, the risk estimate decreased and was no longer
significant, RR¼ 1.16 (95% CI: 0.97–1.38; P¼ 0.10), whereas
no other study had considerable influence on the pooled
estimate.

European Journal of Clinical Nutrition

When restricting the analysis to studies assessing TFA
intake by means of validated FFQs or food records, the effect
estimate for the association of total-TFA intake with CHD
events or fatal CHD did not change considerably (RR¼ 1.21;
95% CI: 1.07–1.37; P¼ 0.002 and RR¼ 1.28; 95% CI:
1.09–1.49; P¼ 0.002 for total and fatal CHD, respectively),
neither did the association of R-TFA with CHD (RR¼ 0.88;
95% CI: 0.71–1.09; P¼ 0.25). Due to the limited number of
identified studies, the relatively low degree of heterogeneity
and the fact that the studies were rated almost equally by
means of the New-Castle-Ottawa Scale, we did not find the
data suitable for further sensitivity analysis.

Discussion

The present systematic review addresses the question of
whether we today have enough available evidence from
prospective cohort studies to evaluate if intake of IP-TFA and
R-TFA, respectively, affects the risk of CHD. Our comprehen-
sive literature search of published and unpublished results
identified limited new data, whereby data from a total of
only eight prospective cohort studies could be pooled.

In accordance with a previous analysis (Skeaff and Miller,
2009), we found that total-TFA intake is associated with an
fatal and total CHD of 420% when
increased risk of
comparing extreme quintiles of intake. Inclusion of unpub-
lished data from two cohort studies resulted in a slightly
lower risk estimate of fatal CHD (RR¼ 1.24), compared with
that found previously (RR¼ 1.32) (Skeaff and Miller, 2009).
We did not calculate a risk estimate for CHD events
associated with incremental TFA intake, since our literature
search did not identify new data that would complement
recent meta-analyses estimating that an increased TFA intake
of 2 E% is associated with an RR of CHD events of 1.23
(1.11–1.37) based on data from NHS, the Health Professionals’
Follow-up Study, the Zutphen Elderly Study (ZES) and AT/BC
(Mozaffarian et al., 2006; Skeaff and Miller, 2009).

Our pooled analyses of the risk associated with R-TFA and
IP-TFA intake, respectively, were compromised by a very
limited number of available studies, which indeed prohibits
any firm conclusions about whether the source of TFA is
important. The pooled estimates suggested that while dietary
IP-TFA may increase the risk of CHD, R-TFA intake does not.
Two studies showed strong positive association of total-TFA
with CHD: the ZES which included elderly men with a very
high TFA intake (Oomen et al., 2001) and the NHS (Oh et al.,
2005). Whereas the association could be ascribed to IP-TFA
intake in the NHS, the ZES did not indicate that R-TFA is less
harmful than IP-TFA.

The validity of any meta-analysis highly depends on
the quality of the included studies. Both the quality of the
dietary assessment and the confounders adjusted for in the
statistical analysis are central features. The lack of an effect in
the SHS and the FMC (unpublished) could be due to the fact
that blood lipids were adjusted for in the analyses from these

foods (Willett, 2006).

In epidemiological studies, the assessment of intake of TFA
is potentially affected by substantial random measurement
error due to a number of factors, such as (1) participant recall
bias; (2) insufficiently updated values in food composition
tables; and (3) substantial changes in the TFA content of
foods over time (L’Abbe et al., 2009). During the 1960s,
margarine became viewed as the healthy alternative to butter
because it was lower in saturated fatty acids (Willett, 2006)
and many food manufacturers and restaurants replaced
tallow and lard with TFA-based products. However, during
the 1990s, the food industry in many countries made efforts
to reduce the TFA content of margarines and shortenings
and in recent years a drastic decline in the industrial-TFA
content of most foods in Western countries has been
reported (Craigh-Schmidt and Rong, 2009). These changes
can only be accounted for by performing repeated assess-
ment of dietary intake.

Also, a problem of confounding by indication may arise in
dietary surveys, and this is difficult to correct for. A subject
with symptoms of CHD or family history of myocardial
infarction may be more aware of consuming a healthy diet,
which in the 1970s meant replacing butter with margarine.
Thereby, subjects at higher risk may have increased their
margarine and with this their IP-TFA consumption while
reducing their butter, and R-TFA, consumption.

Considering the difficulties in assessing TFA intake and the
fact that very few prospective cohort studies have investi-
gated the association between R-TFA or IP-TFA intake and
CHD, data from other types of studies may add important
evidence. The results from a case–control study (Ascherio
et al., 1994) are in support of the results from the pooled
analyses of cohort studies by indicating that IP-TFA was
associated with increased risk, but only at intake levels above
3.3 g/day, whereas R-TFA was neutral
(when comparing
intakes up to 1.8 g/day).

Whereas IP-TFA intake has consistently been shown to
adversely affect risk markers for CHD in controlled trials
(Mozaffarian et al., 2006), very few intervention studies have
examined the effect of R-TFA on cardiovascular risk markers.
One study showed that when men consumed R-TFA in high
amounts (3.7 E% or 10.2 g/day), the effect on blood lipids
was comparable to the effects of
IP-TFA by increasing
the low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol and decreasing
the high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol concentrations in
plasma. However, when R-TFA was consumed in moderate
amounts (1.5 E% or 4.2 g/day), the effect on blood lipids was
not significantly different from that of a control diet with
low TFA content (0.8 E% or 2.2 g/day from any source)
(Motard-Belanger et al., 2008). Recently, an intervention
study also found no difference in the effect of IP-TFA and

European Journal of Clinical Nutrition

R-TFA on blood lipids or insulin sensitivity at low intake
levels (5 g/day) in overweight women (Tardy et al., 2009).
A third intervention study suggested that R-TFA intake
could affect women and men differently. Among women,
both high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol and low-density
lipoprotein-cholesterol were higher after intake of 5 E%
(B11–12 g/day) R-TFA compared with equivalent intakes of
IP-TFA,
whereas only minor differences were observed in men
(Chardigny et al., 2008).
In accordance, no significant
difference between the effects of TFA from the two sources
on the low-density lipoprotein/high-density lipoprotein-
cholesterol ratio (P¼ 0.37) was found in a recent quantitative
review (Brouwer et al., 2010), which compiled the evidence
from 29 and 6 treatments with IP-TFA and R-TFA intake,
respectively.

In summary, the observational evidence suggests that in
contrast to dietary IP-TFA, R-TFA intake does not affect the
risk of CHD or may even be slightly protective. However, this
could be ascribed to the fact
that R-TFA generally is
consumed (1) in much lower quantities than IP-TFA and
(2) together with dairy products, which may be heart
protective (Warensjo et al., 2010). Alternatively, the weak
tendency for a risk reduction seen with R-TFA, may relate to
the fact that vaccenic acid may be converted endogenously to
the conjugated linoleic acid isomer c9,t11-18:2 (Turpeinen
et al., 2002), the adipose tissue content of which has been
shown to be inversely associated with myocardial infarction
risk (Smit et al., 2010).

Denmark introduced legislation, effective from 1 January
2004, restricting the use of TFA to a maximum of 2% in oils
and fats destined for human consumption. R-TFA was
excluded from this legislation. The results of this systematic
review support the notion that TFA intake is detrimental to
the heart. However, the limited number of available studies
prohibits any firm conclusions concerning whether the
source of TFA is important. Any legislative discrimination
between TFA from the two sources must therefore be the
result of a pragmatic decision based on: (1) the low risk of
achieving high daily intakes of R-TFA when consuming
normal foods vs the risk of consuming considerable amount
of IP-TFA with high intakes of certain food products such as
fast food and snacks (or with hydrogenated vegetable oil in
non-Western countries (Singh et al., 1996)); (2) the difficul-
ties in removing R-TFA from natural food sources vs the
achievable elimination of IP-TFA from most foods (Leth
et al., 2006); and (3) the belief that R-TFA-containing foods
are often otherwise healthy, whereby the consumption of
these should not be restricted vs the notion that IP-TFA are
nutritionally unnecessary.

Abstract
Background: Fat content of dairy foods is diverse, potentially leading to varying effects on cardiovascular risk. We
studied relationships of low- and high-fat dairy products with lipids and level of cardiovascular risk (assessed by the
SCORE equation), in a cross-sectional population survey conducted in three French areas.
Subjects and methods: A sample of 3078 participants aged 35–64 years underwent a standardized cardiovascular risk
assessment. Subjects were asked to record the types and amounts of foods and beverages they consumed over a three-
consecutive-day period. Dairy products were separated into two groups: the low-fat group comprised milk (including
milk in desserts and beverages), yogurts and cottage cheese, whereas other cheeses formed the high-fat group.
Results: After adjustment (including physical activity and a diet quality score), the probability of an increased cardio-
vascular mortality score (1%) decreased from the lowest to the highest quartile (Q) of low-fat dairy intake: odds ratio
(OR) ORQ1¼ 1; ORQ2¼ 0.89 (95% confidence interval: 0.73–1.10), ORQ3¼ 0.78 (0.63–0.97) and ORQ4¼ 0.68
(0.55–0.85) for the first, second, third and fourth quartile, respectively. Results were notably different for high-fat
dairy intake: ORQ2¼ 1.02 (0.82–1.25); ORQ3¼ 0.90 (0.73–1.11); ORQ4¼ 1.07 (0.86–1.32). Intake of low-fat dairy prod-
ucts was inversely associated with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), but no significant independent relation-
ship was found with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) or triglycerides. None of the lipid parameters was
significantly associated with the consumption of high-fat dairy products.
Conclusion: Participants with the highest intake of low-fat dairy products had the lowest mortality risk score and
exhibited the best LDL-C profile. Such favourable associations were not observed with cheese consumption.

Introduction

Nutrition promotes the development of numerous dis-
eases, in particular chronic diseases such as cancers1 or
cardiovascular diseases (CVDs).2 Through obesity, it is
also strongly related to most major cardiovascular risk
factors (CVRFs): high blood pressure (HBP), dyslipi-
daemia and diabetes. Dairy products several times a
day are recommended as part of a healthy diet.3,4
However, dairy products are heterogeneous, in particu-
lar with regard to their fat, salt or calcium content,
thus potentially leading to various eﬀects on cardiovas-
cular risk.

Dairy products were ﬁrst suspected to increase risk
of coronary heart disease mortality due to their content
of saturated fatty acids.5 More recent studies have
demonstrated a favourable association between dairy
product consumption and several CVRFs. HBP,6
hypercholesterolemia,7 incidence of type 2 diabetes8–10
and metabolic syndrome11–13 have been inversely asso-
ciated with dairy product consumption.

The aim of this study was to assess the relationships
of low- and high-fat dairy products with lipids and level
of cardiovascular risk in three French areas.

Material and methods

Population

The 2005–2007 MONA LISA multicentre
cross-
sectional population survey was designed to estimate
the prevalence of CVRFs in three French regions:
Lille, Toulouse and Strasbourg areas.14 The sample
was randomly selected from electoral rolls. A total of
4827 men and women aged 35–74 years participated in
the survey (response rate was 50% for men and 51%
for women). The MONA LISA-NUT sub-sample on
which the present analysis is based has been constituted
from the 3490 participants aged 35–64 years.15 Among
them, 88% accepted participation in the nutritional
sub-study.

This study was approved by an ethics committee, in
accordance with the French law on biomedical
research. Written informed consent was obtained
from all participants.

Data collection

Questionnaires were administered by trained physicians
or nurses, who also carried out standardized clinical
examinations. Body mass index (BMI) was computed
as follows: weight (kg)/height (m2). Blood pressure was
measured twice with a standard sphygmomanometer, in
a sitting position, after a 5-min rest, at least, and the
mean of the two measures was used for statistical ana-
lyses. A blood sample was collected after a 10-h fast.
Biological analyses were centralized at the Institut
Pasteur de Lille and included, as previously described:15
glycaemia, total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG),
and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol
(HDL-C).
Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) was com-
puted using the Friedewald formula.

Food record

Food intakes were recorded during three consecutive
days
and one week-end day).
Participants were given oral and written instructions

(two weekdays

on how to note down their consumptions in a diary.
All foods and beverages (types, amounts, cooking tech-
niques and recipes when necessary) were written down,
as well as time,
length, place and circumstances of
lunch. In the days following the record, the food
diary was controlled by a dietician in the presence of
the participant, looking for errors or omissions and
checking food amounts that were declared. Data were
encoded in terms of nutrients, using the 2008 version of
the CIQUAL French food composition table16 com-
pleted by the SU.VI.MAX table.17 Food groups were
constituted thus: dairy products; fruits and vegetables;
starchy food; meat, poultry and eggs; ﬁshery products;
added fats; sweetened food. Dairy products were
divided into two categories:
low-fat dairy products
(milk and milk in desserts, yogurts, cottage cheese)
and high-fat dairy products
(other cheeses). The
food intakes were expressed in g or
amounts of
mg/1000 kJ, corresponding to the daily amount of a
given food ingested by a subject per 1000 kJ of total
daily energy intake.

The Programme National Nutrition Sante´ – Global
Score (PNNS-GS)18 was used to assess participants’
adherence to the French recommendations on several
behaviours. This score consists in 13 items. Eight of
them measure adherence to French serving recommen-
dations (consumption of fruits and vegetables; bread,
cereals, potatoes; vegetables; whole-grain food; milk
and dairy products; meat and poultry, seafood and
eggs; non-alcoholic beverages; alcohol
intake). Four
of them refer to limited consumptions (added fats;
added fat ratio; sweetened food; salt). The ﬁnal item
estimates physical activity. Because
recording of
whole-grain food consumption was not available in
our study, only 12 items were used to assess the score
and the maximal score was 14 points instead of 15.
A higher score indicates a higher adherence to the
recommendations.

Definitions of CVRFs

Only CVRFs potentially inﬂuenced by nutrition habits
were considered in the analyses. The following deﬁn-
itions were used:
HBP: systolic blood pressure (SBP) 140 mmHg and/
or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) 90 mmHg or drug
treatment.
Diabetes: glycaemia 7.0 mmol/l (126 mg/dl) or drug
treatment.
High LDL-C: LDL-C 4.1 mmol/l (160 mg/dl) or drug
treatment.
Low HDL-C: HDL-C 1.0 mmol/l (40 mg/dl).
Hypertriglyceridaemia (hyperTG): TG 1.7 mmol/l
(150 mg/dl).

on Epidemiology

Overweight: BMI 25.0 kg/m2.
Metabolic syndrome was deﬁned according to the
joint deﬁnition from the National Cholesterol
Education Program – Adult Treatment Panel III
(NCEP ATP III) and the International Diabetes
Federation Task Force
and
Prevention (IDF).19
Ten-year risk of cardiovascular mortality was estimated
by the SCORE equation20 and was considered as low if
<1%, moderate if 1–5%, high if 5–10% and very high
if 10%.21 Participants with any of the following were
also considered at high risk:21 markedly elevated blood
pressure (SBP 180 mmHg and/or DBP 110 mmHg);
familial dyslipidaemias; diabetes mellitus without
CVRF or target organ damage; moderate chronic
kidney disease (estimated glomerular ﬁltration rate
(eGFR) of 30–59 ml/min per 1.73 m2). Participants
were at very high risk if they presented one of the fol-
lowing:21 documented CVD (previous myocardial
infarction, acute coronary syndrome, coronary revascu-
larization or other arterial revascularization proced-
ures,
ischaemic stroke, peripheral artery disease);
diabetes with one or more CVRF and/or target organ
damage; severe chronic kidney disease (eGFR < 30 ml/
min per 1.73 m2).

Statistical analyses

Statistical
analyses were performed using Stata
(StataCorp, 2011. Stata Statistical Software: Release
12. College Station, TX: StataCorp LP).

Variables are summarized as percentages or median
with interquartile range. Dairy intakes (total, low- and
high-fat dairy intake) were categorized into quartiles.
The reference group was the lowest (ﬁrst) quartile.
Crude associations between studied variables were
assessed with the 2 test, ANOVA or Kruskal–Wallis
test.

Independent relationships between CVRFs (as cited
above) and dairy intakes (total, low- and high-fat dairy
products) were assessed using binary logistic regression
which was systematically adjusted for region, gender,
age, education level, physical activity, alcohol intake,
smoking habits, diet (following or not following a diet
for either HBP, dyslipidaemia or diabetes), diet quality
score (PNNS-GS) and total daily energy intake. Then,
adjustment for PNNS-GS was replaced by adjustment
for individual food groups (level of consumption of
fruits and vegetables; starchy food; meat, poultry and
eggs; ﬁshery products; added fats; sweetened food;
wine). Models exploring the risk of having a moderate
to very high 10-year risk of cardiovascular mortality
were adjusted for
for
gender, age and smoking habits, as these variables are
considered to estimate the probability of 10-year

the same variables except

cardiovascular mortality. Linear trends were tested
using orthogonal polynomial contrasts.22 Interactions
between centre (region), gender, age and dairy intakes
were tested. The level of signiﬁcance was set at p < 0.05.
Tests were two-sided.

Results

Three thousand and seventy-eight men and women
took part in the nutritional survey. Characteristics of
the participants are presented in Table 1, together with
daily energy intake and quartiles of dairy intakes.
Compared with national French statistics (National
Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies, INSEE,
http://www.insee.fr/), a slightly higher socioeconomic
status was observed in our sample.

Crude associations with intake of dairy products

Total and low-fat dairy intakes were signiﬁcantly
higher among women, participants who did not
smoke and those who were on a diet (p < 0.001).

Intakes of low-fat dairy products were positively
associated with fruits and vegetables, and ﬁshery prod-
ucts, and negatively with starchy food, meat, poultry
and eggs, and wine (Table 2). On the other hand, higher
consumptions of high-fat dairy products were asso-
ciated with lower intakes of fruits and vegetables,
meat, poultry and eggs and ﬁshery products, but a
higher wine consumption (Table 2).

Total and low-fat dairy intakes were signiﬁcantly
and negatively associated with SBP, DBP, LDL-C,
TG and glucose levels, frequency of HBP, high LDL-
C, hyperTG, diabetes
(low-fat only), metabolic
syndrome and score of 10-year risk of cardiovascular
mortality (Tables 2 and 3). They were positively asso-
ciated with HDL-C levels. High-fat dairy intake was
positively associated with SBP, overweight and score
of 10-year risk of cardiovascular mortality, before
adjustment (Tables 2 and 3).

CVRFs remaining associated with dairy intake
after adjustment (Table 4)

Presenting with high LDL-C and having a moderate to
very high 10-year risk of cardiovascular mortality were
signiﬁcantly and inversely associated with low-fat dairy
intake, after adjustment. Higher consumers also had a
lower risk of metabolic syndrome.

No CVRF was signiﬁcantly associated with high-fat
dairy intake after adjustment (a trend was observed,
however,
for a higher risk of overweight among
higher consumers of high-fat dairy products).

not shown).

Discussion

Low-fat dairy intake was inversely associated with high
LDL-C and moderate to very high 10-year risk of car-
diovascular mortality. It was also associated with a
healthier diet, characterized by higher consumptions
of fruits and vegetables and ﬁsh products, and less
wine intake. High-fat dairy intake tended to be posi-
tively associated with overweight, with no signiﬁcant
independent relationship with lipid proﬁle, metabolic
syndrome or 10-year risk score of cardiovascular
mortality.

Agreement with previous studies
Unlike several other studies,8–10 diabetes was not inde-
pendently associated with dairy consumption in the
present analysis. This discrepancy might be explained
by the inclusion of subjects younger than 65, and con-
sequently a relatively low prevalence of diabetes in our
sample.

While Benatar et al. found no eﬀect of a one-month
change in dairy intake on CVRFs,23 an inverse associ-
ation between metabolic syndrome, its components and
dairy consumption has been found in previous stu-
dies.11–13 In the CARDIA study,11 after 10 years of
follow-up, a strong inverse association was observed
between dairy consumption and incident metabolic syn-
drome, although only among 18–30-year-old over-
weight men. The Caerphilly study12
found that

increased dairy consumption was associated with a
markedly reduced prevalence of metabolic syndrome
among men. The DESIR study, conducted in the
French population,13 came to the same conclusions.
Possible mechanisms have been summarized by
Tremblay and Gilbert:24 calcium could increase fat oxi-
dation, lipolysis and faecal fat loss and could help in
appetite control. Calcium also exhibits a blood pressure
lowering eﬀect by decreasing vascular resistance and
sodium retention.25 Moreover, whey proteins may inhi-
bit the angiotensin-converting enzyme,26 the role of
which in blood pressure management has already
been proven. Finally, Pal et al.27 found that a supple-
mentation with whey protein for 12 weeks in over-
weight and obese individuals decreased TC, LDL-C
and TG levels compared with the control group (with-
out supplementation).

The Rotterdam prospective study28 found that HBP
was not associated with cheese consumption while it
was negatively associated with milk and other dairy
products. Conversely to our results, signiﬁcant associ-
ations remained after adjustment. This diﬀerence could
be explained by the fact that our study included sub-
jects younger (35–64 years old) than those included in
the Rotterdam study, where participants were aged
over 55. Diﬀerences in the adjustment of the statistical
models may also have accounted for diﬀerences in
adjusted results.

Beyond CVRFs, it was important to also study over-
all cardiovascular risk in regard to dairy product con-
sumption. Higher total and low-fat dairy intakes were
associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular mortal-
ity, assessed by the SCORE equation. Results were

similar when the Framingham equation was used (data
not shown). Several meta-analyses29 conﬁrmed these
results. Soedamah-Muthu et al.30 showed that milk
intake and risk of overall cardiovascular disease were,
modestly, inversely associated. Elwood et al.31 showed
that subjects with the highest total milk and dairy
intakes had lower odds of vascular events (ischaemic
heart disease and ischaemic stroke) compared with sub-
jects with the lowest intakes.

In our study, no signiﬁcant association was found
between high-fat dairy intake (comprising all cheeses
except cottage cheese) and lipid proﬁle or risk score
of cardiovascular mortality. Likewise, cheese intake
was not associated with all-cause or cardiovascular
mortality in a cohort of Australian adults32 or with
ischaemic heart disease mortality in the Netherlands
cohort study.33

which score calculation is based. Accordingly, results
regarding cardiovascular risk score in the present
study mainly reﬂect the link observed between dairy
intake and high LDL-C. Typically, saturated fatty
acids (SFAs) increase LDL-C, whereas mono- and
poly-unsaturated do not, thus explaining that whole
milk has been shown to increase plasma cholesterol in
clinical studies.34 On the other hand, calcium has been
associated in animal and human studies with decreased
cholesterol levels, mainly through formation of intes-
tinal insoluble fatty acid soaps and subsequent increased
faecal fat excretion.34 One can therefore hypothesize
that the beneﬁcial impact of calcium on cholesterol
level may be counterbalanced by the deleterious
impact of saturated fat contents in whole-fat dairy prod-
ucts. When fat content is lower, as it is in low-fat dairy
products, the beneﬁcial impact of calcium may be more
obvious, thus potentially leading to lower LDL-C levels.

Differences between low- and high-fat dairy
products, and cardiovascular risk score

Strengths and limitations

The estimation of cardiovascular risk with the SCORE
equation clearly depends on the levels of CVRFs on

One strength of this study is the quantitative three-
consecutive-day recording of
food consumptions,

which allowed us to precisely quantify micronutrients,
macronutrients and foodstuﬀ intakes, while numerous
studies use food frequency questionnaires. Another
strong point is that we were able to evaluate relation-
ships of dairy intake with the overall cardiovascular risk.
The main limitation is the impossibility of establish-
ing causality due to the cross-sectional design of the
study. Indeed, we cannot determine whether changes
in diet preceded or followed risk factor onset (for
instance, people could have altered their diet after
being diagnosed with a CVRF). Another major diﬃ-
culty is that interpretation of nutrition studies can be
complicated by the intricate relationship between feed-
ing behaviour and lifestyle.35 In our study, high con-
sumptions of low-fat dairy products were signiﬁcantly
associated with better dietary habits. Although models
were adjusted for diet quality, remaining confounding
may have persisted. Finally, although a large sample
was enrolled in the study, only three French regions
were covered.

Conclusion

Participants with the highest low-fat dairy intakes
exhibited the lowest risk scores of cardiovascular mor-
tality and presented with the best lipid proﬁle, whereas
no signiﬁcant independent association was found for
high-fat dairy intake. Long-term intervention studies
are needed to investigate the association between over-
all cardiovascular risk and dairy consumption.

Consumption of low-fat dairy foods for 6 months
improves insulin resistance without adversely
affecting lipids or bodyweight in healthy adults:
a randomized free-living cross-over study

Abstract

Background: Given the highly debated role of dairy food consumption in modulating biomarkers of metabolic
syndrome, this study was conducted to examine the influence of long-term (6 month) dairy consumption on
metabolic parameters in healthy volunteers under free-living conditions without energy restriction.
Methods: Twenty-three healthy subjects completed a randomized, crossover trial of 12 months. Participants
consumed their habitual diets and were randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups: a high dairy
supplemented group instructed to consume 4 servings of dairy per day (HD); or a low dairy supplemented group
limited to no more than 2 servings of dairy per day (LD). Baseline, midpoint, and endpoint metabolic responses
were examined.
Results: Endpoint measurements of body weight and composition, energy expenditure, blood pressure, blood
glucose, and blood lipid and lipoprotein responses did not differ (p > 0.05) between the LD and HD groups. HD
consumption improved (p < 0.05) plasma insulin (−9%) and insulin resistance (−11%, p = 0.03) as estimated by
HOMA-IR compared with the LD group.
Conclusions: Study results suggest that high dairy consumption (4 servings/d) may improve insulin resistance
without negatively impacting bodyweight or lipid status under free-living conditions.

Background
Dairy has been an important component of the human
diet, mainly valued for its superior amino acid compos-
ition, high protein quality, and a source of calcium [1]. Be-
yond it’s macronutrient composition, low fat dairy foods

consumption of low fat dairy products is associated with
a low incidence of type 2 diabetes compared with low

studies by Tong et al. [11] suggests that increased con-
sumption of total and low fat dairy products may reduce
the risk of type 2 diabetes by 5 and 10%, respectively.
This disease reduction potential may be linked with the

dairy products is associated with a lower probability of
insulin resistance (odds ratio 0.67) [13].

Alternatively,

it has been suggested that long-term
high fat dairy consumption may underlie the pathogen-
esis of type II diabetes by promoting β-cell apoptosis
[14] and increase CVD risk by contributing to hyperlip-
idemia. These negative health responses may be linked
with increased intake of insulin-like growth factors (1 & 2)
[3] and saturated fat of dairy foods [15-17]. Inconsistent
data from different studies on the health benefits of dairy
may be attributed to differences in experimental design
(study population, health status, ethnicity, and gender)
[18] and differential health effects of specific dairy prod-
ucts [19]. Furthermore, it has been suggested that the
health promoting effects of increased dairy consumption,
particularly with respect to weight loss, may be associated
with an energy restricted diet [20]. Additional long-term
randomized controlled trials are needed to resolve the
current controversies
in-
creased dairy consumption on risk factors for type 2
diabetes,
in addition to other metabolic health re-
sponses. Therefore, the aim of the present study was
to examine the long-term (6 months) effects of high
dairy consumption (4 servings per day) on metabolic
parameters in healthy volunteers under free-living
conditions without energy restriction or other lifestyle
modifications. The primary aim of this study was to
observe the effect of dairy consumption on metabolic
parameters including blood lipids, glucose, and insu-
lin. Secondary endpoints were body weight and com-
position, and energy expenditure.

Methods
The study was conducted at the Clinical Nutrition Re-
search Unit at the Richardson Centre for Functional
Foods and Nutraceuticals (RCFFN), University of Mani-
toba between April 2009 – May 2011. Subjects were
recruited from the Winnipeg area via newspaper and
radio endorsements, poster advertisements, and flyer
distributions.

Inclusion/exclusion criteria
Male and female subjects (18–75 years of age) were eli-
gible for study participation if they had a BMI between
18.5-35.0 kg/m2 and were assessed to be healthy based
on a pre-study screening examination including medical,
diet, and lifestyle history. Age and BMI inclusion ranges
were wide-ranging in anticipation of difficulty
in
recruiting subjects for a 1-year intervention. Subjects
were excluded if pregnant; diagnosed with diabetes or
cardiovascular,
liver, or renal disease; reported regular
use of appetite suppressants or Orlistat (Xenical) or ir-
regular use of other treatments which might interfere
with the outcomes of the study (e.g. anti-hypertensives,
statins, thyroxine, omega-3 supplements); reported ha-
bitual consumption of more than 1 ½ servings of dairy
per day; or were unable to consume 4 servings of low fat
dairy per day for 6 months due to known allergy or dairy
intolerance. To confirm individual health status and eli-
gibility, all subjects underwent a complete physical
examination conducted by the study physician.

Study design and protocol
The study protocol was approved by the Joint Faculty
Research Ethics Board (JFREB) at
the University of
Manitoba. All subjects signed informed consent to par-
ticipate in the study.

The study was a randomized, crossover trial of 12
months with no washout period due to the length of
each study phase (Figure 1). At the onset of the study,
eligible participants (n = 39) were instructed to consume
their habitual diets and randomly assigned to one of two
treatment groups for 6 months using a random number
generator: a high dairy supplemented group instructed
to consume 4 servings dairy per day (HD); or a low dairy
supplemented group limited to no more than 2 serving
dairy per day (LD). At the end of the initial 6-month
phase, subjects initially randomized to the HD group
were switched to the LD treatment and vise versa for
the remainder of the study. The LD and HD serving
sizes were based on Canada’s Food Guide, which recom-
mends 2–3 servings of low fat dairy products per day

depending on age and sex. However,
it has been
reported that 65-80% of Canadian adult consume less
than 2 servings per day [21]. Subjects assigned to the
HD group were regularly provided (every 2 weeks) with
standard servings of low fat dairy products (eg. 250 mL
milk, 175 g yogurt) for dietary incorporation as indicated
in Canada’s Food Guide. Subjects were instructed to
consume only those dairy products that were provided
by the research staff. During the HD phase, subjects
were asked to incorporate dairy products into their diets
by substitution so as not to increase their normal energy
intake. During the LD phase, subjects were instructed to
consume their normal diets but to not exceed more than
2 servings of dairy per day. Nutrient composition of the
low fat dairy products is presented in Table 1. Subjects
were instructed to maintain their normal diet and level
of physical activity for the duration of the study periods.
Beyond instructions as to how to incorporate dairy into
their daily diet, the subjects received no dietary counsel-
ing throughout the study period.

Data collection time points
At two separate points during each phase (4 and 6
months of each intervention phase), subjects were asked
to complete a food frequency questionnaire (adapted
from the National Institutes of Health Diet History
Questionnaire), physical activity diary, and 3-day mid-
week food record. To monitor compliance, subjects were
provided with a logbook and asked to record the num-
ber of dairy servings consumed each day. At baseline
and the end of each 6-month period, fasting measure-
ments of body weight, blood pressure, DEXA, and indir-
ect calorimetry were obtained. Furthermore, 12-h fasted
blood draws were collected for blood biochemistry
measurements at baseline, midpoint, and endpoint as
outlined in Figure 1. Subject anthropometric and meta-
bolic measurements taken prior to the start of the study
are provided in Table 2.

Procedures
Blood collection and blood pressure
Twelve-hour fasting serum and plasma blood samples
were collected at the beginning and end of each study
phase. Blood was centrifuged at 3000 × g for 20 minutes
at 4°C to separate serum and plasma from erythrocytes,
which were then stored at −20°C for future analyses.
Resting blood pressure and heart rate (average of two
measurements) were recorded by automated oscillo-
metry with the subject in supine position.

Body composition protocol
Body composition, including percentage of total fat mass
(%TFM), TFM and total lean mass, as well as percentage
android and gynoid fat, were assessed at the start and

Rideout et al. Nutrition Journal 2013, 12:56

end of each study phase using fan beam dual-energy
X-ray absorptiometry (LunarProdigy Advance; GE Health-
care, Madison, WI, USA). Body composition data
including %TFM, TFM, and total lean mass were deter-
mined using Encore 2005 software version 9.30.044 (GE
Healthcare).

Energy expenditure
At the beginning and end of each study phase, fasting
energy expenditure was determined using open circuit
indirect calorimetry (Vmax Encore, Summit Technolo-
gies Inc, Burlington ON Canada) fitted with a ventilated
canopy. The flow sensor and gas sensors were calibrated
daily prior to initiating respiratory measurements. The
flow sensor was calibrated using a calibration syringe.
Gas sensors were automatically calibrated by Vmax En-
core software (Cardinal Health, Maple, ON Canada)
using two reference gasses with the first containing 16%
O2, 4% CO2 and 80% N2 and the second containing 26%
O2, 0% CO2 and 74% N2. All indirect calorimetry data
was collected using Vmax Encore software. Commence-
ment of pre-menopausal women into the study was
planned such that they did not undergo indirect calor-
imetry measurements during their menstrual cycle. In-
direct calorimetry measurements were taken for 30 min.
The first 15 min acted as a stabilization period, while
data from the latter 15 min was used to determine
fasting energy expenditure, fat oxidation and carbohy-
drate oxidation. The methodologies used to calculate
these measures are discussed elsewhere [22]. As subjects
were fasting, the constant 0.829 L O2/g glycogen was
used to calculate carbohydrate oxidation [23,24].

Blood biochemistry analyses
Plasma total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein
cholesterol
triglycerides (TG), and glucose
were determined by automated enzymatic methods
on a Vitros 350 chemistry analyzer (Ortho-Clinical
Diagnostics, Markham, Ontario, Canada). LDL-C con-
centrations were estimated by the difference method
using the Friedewald formula. Apolipoproteins were
measured by immunoturbidometric assay on a Pentra
400 autoanalyzer according to manufacturer’s instruc-
tions (Kamiya Biomedical Company, Seattle, WA, USA;
kits: ApoB, KAI-004; ApoE KAI-007; CII, KAI-005; Lp
(a), KAI-044). Serum insulin was analysed by ELISA
(EZHIASF-14K, Millipore, Billerica, MA). Insulin home-
ostasis modeling assessment (HOMA) was utilized as an
estimate for insulin resistance (IR). HOMA values were
calculated using previously outlined methods [25].

Statistical analysis
The study was powered based on previously reported
lipid responses
following 21 weeks of high dairy

consumption [26,27]. A sample size of 20 subjects was
anticipated to detect a 19% reduction in blood TG
(alpha 0.05; 0.80 power). In anticipation of a large drop-
out rate due to the long study duration, 39 subjects were
recruited to begin the trial. Data were analyzed with a
linear mixed model ANOVA with subject as a random
factor. Baseline measurements of each phase were used
as covariates for endpoint measurements. Data were fur-
ther analyzed as percent change from baseline responses
for LD vs. HD phases. Macronutrient intake data col-
lected from mid-week 3-day food records were analyzed
with Food processor (Food processor, Salem, OR). All
data are presented as means ± SD and statistical signifi-
cance was set at p < 0.05 for all analyses. Data were ana-
lyzed using IBM SPSS software version 19.0 (SPSS, Inc.,
Chicago, IL, USA).

cardiometabolic risk factors. Of these 144 respondents,
51 individuals were screened and deemed eligible for the
trial, and 39 subjects agreed to participate. Of the initial
39 subjects that began the study, 23 completed both
study phases (n = 23 for both LD and HD). Subjects pro-
vided several reasons for dropping out of the study in-
cluding an inability to consume the required daily
amount of dairy (n = 2), personal family obligations (n =
13), and relocation (n = 1) (Figure 2). Baseline character-
istics of dropout subjects were not different (p > 0.05)
than those who completed the study (data not shown).

Macronutrient intake during the two periods did not
(p > 0.05) between the LD and HD groups
differ
(Table 3). Calcium intake in the HD group tended to be
higher (p = 0.10) than the LD group whereas there was
no difference (p > 0.05) in vitamin D intake between
groups (Table 3).

Endpoint and percent change adjusted whole-body
and metabolic responses between the LD and HD
phases are presented in Table 4. Although no difference
(p > 0.05) was observed in blood glucose between the LD
and HD groups, HD consumption reduced (p < 0.05)
plasma insulin and improved (p < 0.05) insulin resistance
as estimated by HOMA-IR, (endpoint and percent change
Table 4). Endpoint and percent change variables in body
weight and body composition, energy expenditure, blood
pressure, and blood lipid and lipoprotein responses did
not differ (p > 0.05) between the LD and HD phases.

fasting plasma insulin (9%) and improved insulin resist-
ance (11%) in overweight and obese adults. Although the
long-term clinical implications of these results are un-
clear, fasting insulin and HOMA-IR have been shown to
be sensitive predictive markers of diabetes,
ischemic
stroke, and coronary heart disease risk in the general
population as well as in at-risk subjects [28-32]. Previous
data from the Verona Diabetes Complications Study sug-
gest that every 1-unit increase in HOMA-IR is associ-
ated with an odds ratio of CVD incidence of 1.56 in
Type II diabetics [33]. This improvement in insulin re-
sistance may be protective in this population of over-
weight and obese individuals.

Our results are supported by dairy intervention studies
under both controlled feeding and free-living conditions.
Compared to a low dairy diet (<0.5 servings/d), a 12-
week study by Stancliffe et al. (2011) reported reductions
in fasting insulin and insulin resistance in a similar
population of overweight and obese subjects consuming
dairy as milk and yogurt (3.5 serving/d) [6]. Similar re-
sults were recently reported by Nikooyeh et al. (2011)
[34] in type 2 diabetics consuming 250 mL/day of plain,
vitamin D-fortified, or a vitamin D + calcium-fortified
yogurt drink. Moreover, results from a recent meta-
analysis and previous observational and prospective

cohort studies support long-term dairy consumption in
lowering the incidence of type II diabetes and metabolic
syndrome [11,35-37].

Alternatively, a recently published 12-month cross-
over study examining the cardiometabolic health re-
sponses to increased dairy consumption by Crichton
et al. [38] did not observe an insulin sensitizing response
to HD vs. LD intake. This study was similar to the
present study in terms of design (crossover), length (6
month), dairy servings (HD, 4 servings/d vs. LD, ≤ 1
servings/d), and study population (overweight and
obese). However, while our study limited dairy products
to low fat milk and yogurt, the study design by Crichton
et al. was more inclusive by incorporating low fat fla-
vored milk and yogurt, vanilla custard, and a limited
amount
(no more than 7 servings/week) of cheese
(sliced, cottage, ricotta, cream), ice cream, butter, and
margarine. We deliberately utilized milk and yogurt as
treatments because these dairy products have reasonably
long expiration dates, are easily portable, and can be
readily incorporated into the diet. Depending on ingredi-
ent
and manufacturing
process, dairy products have a broad range of textural
and physiochemical properties. These differences greatly

composition,

formulation,

influence the bioavailability of dairy-derived nutrients
and bioactive compounds and may ultimately affect the
magnitude and direction of health responses following
their consumption. Although our results suggest that
consumption of dairy foods in the form of milk and
yogurt may have beneficial cardiometabolic effects, it is
difficult to speculate if similar responses would be ob-
served in response to the consumption of other dairy
foods. Ivey et al. (2011) [19] recently reported that, com-
pared to milk and cheese, yogurt consumption decreased
carotid artery intima-media thickness in elderly women.
Thus, studies designed to specifically examine health re-
sponses to different whole dairy foods and isolated dairy
food bioactive components are clearly warranted.

Numerous milk-derived bioactive compounds may
contribute to the insulin-sensitizing effects of dairy in-
cluding calcium, vitamin D, whole whey protein, and
fractionated peptides [39,40]. Vitamin D is well recog-
nized in sensitizing insulin responses through multiple
purported mechanisms which include regulation of insu-
lin receptor expression and stimulation of insulin release
by pancreatic β-cells [41,42]. Although both milk and
yogurt products used in the present study were vitamin
D fortified as stipulated under Canadian federal law, we

Rideout et al. Nutrition Journal 2013, 12:56

observed no difference in vitamin D intake between the
LD and HD phases, suggesting that the insulin sensitiz-
ing response to increased dairy intake was independent
of vitamin D consumption. However, as this study was
designed as free-living and assessed nutrient intake using
food records, it is subject to design limitations including
poor dietary recall [43,44]. Limitations of dietary recall
during the 3-day food record may also be responsible for
the tendency (p = 0.1) observed in calcium intake be-
tween the HD (1222 mg) and LD (1024 mg) groups.

Given that the present study was designed to examine
the combined health response to low-fat milk and yogurt
whole foods, we cannot partition the effects of the spe-
cific dairy foods or identify the particular bioactive com-
ponent(s) that may be responsible for the protective
effects against increased insulin resistance. The vast ma-
jority of studies examining the influence of dairy con-
sumption on biomarkers of metabolic syndrome have
been conducted with whole dairy foods with very few
studies designed to partition the specific health effects of
isolated dairy components. One notable exception is a re-
cent study by Palacios et al. (2011) [26] who reported no
change in body composition or serum lipids in obese sub-
jects instructed to consume low calorie diets providing
~1200 mg/d calcium from dairy or calcium supplements.

Concerns have been raised that high dairy consump-
tion may be associated with an increased risk of
dyslipidemia and obesity [3]. However, the results of this
study lend further support to a growing clinical trial
database suggesting that low fat dairy foods can be in-
corporated into diets without adversely raising blood
lipids [38,45-47]. Similarly, there is no clear consensus of
the long-term effects of dairy consumption on body
weight and body composition, with reports of both in-
creased [48], decreased [49-51], and neutral [52,53] body
weight changes following dairy consumption. A recent
systematic literature review by Kratz et al. examining 16
studies [54] found little support for the hypothesis that
increased dairy fat or high fat dairy food consumption
contributes to increased adiposity. Similarly, a meta-
analysis from Chen et al. [55] using 29 RCT recently ex-
amined the effects of dairy consumption on body weight
and body fat mass. Their results suggest that dairy con-
sumption may not be associated with weight gain, but
may have a modest effect in facilitating weight loss in
energy restricted and short-term (<1 yr)
intervention
studies. Results from the present 6 month study demon-
strate that, under free-living conditions and without en-
ergy restriction,
long-term low-fat dairy consumption
does not alter body weight, body composition or energy
expenditure. These results further suggest that the insu-
lin sensitizing effects of dairy consumption are not re-
lated to body fat loss or factors that modulate energy
metabolism.

There are several

limitations to this study. First,

it
proved difficult to sustain volunteer interest over such a
long trial duration and only 23 subjects of the original
39 fully completed each of
the study phases (41%
dropout rate); however, we were able to retain our de-
sired target of 20 subjects. Interestingly, the previously
discussed study by Crichton et al. [38] with a similar de-
sign to ours also had a high drop-out rate (49%), which
suggests that future studies involving high dairy con-
sumption may benefit from a parallel arm design. Until a
similar study is repeated with a larger study population,
our results should be interpreted with caution. Second,
although volunteers were given log books to record their
daily dairy intake, these records were not reviewed by
the study staff until the end of the study, at which point
it was determined that they were incomplete. Therefore,
the lack of a compliance evaluation and actual dairy in-
takes are a major limitation of the current study. Third,
subjects were provided with dairy products during the
HD phase but were not provided with dairy-free foods
of comparable macronutrient composition during the
LD phase. This could have resulted in differences in food
intake and/or macronutrient balance between the two
phases beyond the sensitivity of
the dietary analysis
conducted.

Conclusions
In conclusion, the current study suggests that under
free-living conditions, consumption of 4 servings/d of
low-fat dairy milk and yogurt products for 6 months
may improve
insulin resistance without negatively
impacting bodyweight or lipid status. These results re-
quire verification from additional long-term studies with
appropriate measures to increase subject retention. Fu-
ture studies should also be designed to further examine
the metabolic effects of specific dairy products and/or
dairy-derived bioactive components.

Trans Fatty Acids 

and Cardiovascular Disease

Dariush Mozaffarian, M.D., M.P.H., Martijn B. Katan, Ph.D., 

Alberto Ascherio, M.D., Dr.P.H., Meir J. Stampfer, M.D., Dr.P.H., 

and Walter C. Willett, M.D., Dr.P.H.

T rans  fats,  unsaturated  fatty  acids  with  at  least  one  double 

bond in the trans configuration (Fig. 1), are formed during the partial hydro-
genation of vegetable oils, a process that converts vegetable oils into semi-
solid  fats  for  use  in  margarines,  commercial  cooking,  and  manufacturing  pro-
cesses. From the perspective of the food industry, partially hydrogenated vegetable 
oils are attractive because of their long shelf life, their stability during deep-frying, 
and  their  semisolidity,  which  can  be  customized  to  enhance  the  palatability  of 
baked goods and sweets. The average consumption of industrially produced trans 
fatty acids in the United States is 2 to 3 percent of total calories consumed.1 Major 
sources of trans fats are deep-fried fast foods, bakery products, packaged snack 
foods, margarines, and crackers (Table 1). Naturally occurring trans fats are con-
sumed in smaller amounts (about 0.5 percent of total energy intake) in meats and 
dairy products from cows, sheep, and other ruminants; these trans fats are pro-
duced by the action of bacteria in the ruminant stomach.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) ruled that, effective January 1, 2006, 
the nutrition labels for all conventional foods and supplements must indicate the 
content of trans fatty acids.2 This ruling represents the first substantive change to 
food labeling since the requirement for the listing of basic per-serving nutritional 
information was added in 1990. The Department of Agriculture made a limited in-
take of trans fatty acids a key recommendation of the new food-pyramid guidelines,3 
subsequent to the recommendations of the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee 
that the consumption of trans fatty acids be kept below 1 percent of total energy 
intake.4 The New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene has asked 
20,000  restaurants  and  14,000  food  suppliers  to  eliminate  partially  hydrogenated 
oils from kitchens and to provide foods and food products that are free of industri-
ally produced trans fatty acids.5 Denmark has enacted, and Canada is considering, 
legislation to eliminate industrially produced trans fats from food supplies.6,7

Each of these actions was prompted by evidence that consumption of trans fatty 
acids increases the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD). This article reviews the 
evidence of physiological and cellular effects of trans fatty acids, the relations be-
tween the intake of trans fat and CHD, sudden death from cardiac causes, and dia-
betes; and the feasibility and potential implications of reducing or eliminating the 
consumption of trans fatty acids from partially hydrogenated vegetable oils in the 
United States.

Cis double bond

Trans double bond

Figure 1. Structure of Cis and Trans Fatty Acids. 
Both oleic acid and elaidic acid are 18-carbon fatty acids with a single double 
bond. However, oleic acid has a cis double bond (hydrogen atoms are on 
the same side of the bond), which causes a bend or kink in the fatty acid 
chain, whereas elaidic acid has a trans double bond (hydrogen atoms are 
on opposite sides of the bond), which straightens the fatty acid chain. The 
trans bond imparts a structure more similar to that of saturated fats, alter-
ing the physiological properties and effects of the fatty acid. In elaidic acid, 
the double bond occurs at the ninth carbon atom (trans-18:1n−9). Partially 
hydrogenated oils contain mixtures of isomers in which the trans bond may 
occur anywhere between the 4th and the 10th carbon; smaller amounts of 
isomers with a second trans double bond (trans, trans-18:2) are also present.

PHYSIOLOGICAL EFFECTS 
OF TR ANS FAT T Y ACIDS

Serum Lipids
The main effects of trans fatty acids on serum 
lipid levels have been evaluated in controlled di-
etary trials. The effect on serum lipid levels of 
isocaloric replacement of saturated fat or cis un-
saturated fats with trans fat was calculated from 
a meta-analysis of 12 randomized, controlled tri-
als  of  trans  fatty  acid  consumption  published 
through November 2005 (Fig. 2). These data were 
derived  from  524  subjects  in  39  separate  study 
groups or study periods8-19 with the use of previ-
ously  described  methods20  (Mensink  R,  Maas-
tricht  University:  personal  communication)  and 
established effects of saturated and cis unsatu-
rated fats on serum lipid levels.20 As compared 
with  the  consumption  of  an  equal  number  of 

calories from saturated or cis unsaturated fats, 
the consumption of trans fatty acids raises levels 
of  low-density  lipoprotein  (LDL)  cholesterol,  re-
duces  levels  of  high-density  lipoprotein  (HDL) 
cholesterol, and increases the ratio of total cho-
lesterol to HDL cholesterol, a powerful predictor 
of the risk of CHD.21 Trans fats also increase the 
blood levels of triglycerides as compared with the 
intake of other fats,20 increase levels of Lp(a) li-
poprotein,22 and reduce the particle size of LDL 
cholesterol,23 each of which may further raise the 
risk of CHD. Thus, trans fatty acids have mark-
edly adverse effects on serum lipids. Although 
these effects would be expected to increase the 
risk of CHD, the relation between the intake of 
trans fats and the incidence of CHD reported in 
prospective studies has been greater than that pre-
dicted by changes in serum lipid levels alone,20,22 
suggesting that trans fatty acids may also influ-
ence other risk factors for CHD.

Systemic Inflammation
Recent evidence indicates that trans fats promote 
inflammation. In women, greater intake of trans 
fatty acids was associated with increased activity 
of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) system; among 
those with a higher body-mass index, greater in-
take of trans fatty acids was also associated with 
increased levels of interleukin-6 and C-reactive 
protein.24 In a study of overweight women, great-
er intake of trans fat was again associated with 
increased activity of the TNF system and increased 
levels of interleukin-6 and C-reactive protein.25 
In patients with established heart disease, mem-
brane levels of trans fatty acids (a biomarker of the 
dietary intake of trans fats) were independently 
associated with activation of systemic inflamma-
tory responses, including substantially increased 
levels of interleukin-6, TNF-α, TNF receptors, and 
monocyte chemoattractant protein 1.26

Inflammatory effects have also been reported 
in randomized, controlled trials. In patients with 
hypercholesterolemia, the production of interleu-
kin-6 and TNF-α by cultured mononuclear cells 
was greater after one month of a soybean-mar-
garine diet (6.7 percent of energy from trans fatty 
acids) than after one month of a soybean-oil diet 
(0.6 percent of energy from trans fatty acids); the 
production of interleukin-1β was not significantly

plasma levels of interleukin-6 and C-reactive pro-
tein.28 In these trials, the inflammatory effects 
of trans fatty acids did not differ significantly from 
those of saturated fat.27,28

Because the presence of inflammation is an 
independent risk factor for atherosclerosis, sud-
den death from cardiac causes, diabetes, and heart 
failure,29-32 the inflammatory effects of trans fats 
may account in part for their effects on cardio-
vascular health. For example, on the basis of the 
positive association between C-reactive protein 
levels and the risk of cardiovascular disease,33 the 
difference in C-reactive protein levels seen with a 
median intake of trans fat of 2.1 percent, as com-
pared with 0.9 percent, of the total energy in-
take25 would correspond to an increase in risk of 
approximately 30 percent.

Endothelial-Cell Function
Several studies suggest that trans fats cause en-
dothelial dysfunction. After adjustment for other 
risk factors, greater intake of trans fatty acids was 
associated with increased levels of several mark-
ers of endothelial dysfunction, including soluble 
intercellular adhesion molecule 1, soluble vascu-
lar-cell adhesion molecule 1, and E-selectin.25 This 
observed increase in E-selectin levels was similar 
to findings in a randomized trial when oleic acid 
or carbohydrate was replaced isocalorically with 
trans fat.28 In another trial, consumption of trans 
fatty acids impaired endothelial function, as re-
flected by a reduction in brachial artery flow-medi-
ated vasodilatation by 29 percent, as compared 
with intake of saturated fat.34

Other Effects
Trans fatty acids may influence other risk factors 
for cardiovascular disease. In controlled trials, con-
sumption  of  trans  fat  reduced  the  activity  of 
serum paraoxonase,35 an enzyme that is closely as-
sociated with HDL cholesterol,and impaired the 
postprandial activity of tissue plasminogen acti-
vator.36 Trials evaluating the effects of the con-
sumption of trans fatty acids on insulin sensi-
tivity  have  shown  variable  results.18,37-41  Such 
variability may be due to differences in the popu-
lation or the measure of insulin resistance exam-
ined and may depend on the duration of intake 
(short-term trials may not detect an effect). Fur-
ther investigation is needed to elucidate the pos-
sible effects of trans fatty acids on these and other 
physiological pathways.

POTENTIAL MOLECUL AR 

MECHANISMS

Far  from  being  inert  carriers  of  calories,  fatty 
acids are powerful modulators of cell function, 
altering membrane fluidity and responses of mem-
brane receptors by means of their incorporation 
into the phospholipids in cellular membranes.42-44 
Fatty acids also bind to and modulate nuclear re-
ceptors that regulate gene transcription, such as 
peroxisome-proliferator–activated receptors, liver 
X receptor, and sterol regulatory element-binding 
protein-1.45 Fatty acids may also directly or indi-
rectly modulate metabolic and inflammatory re-
sponses of the endoplasmic reticulum.46 By means 
of such effects, trans fatty acids may thereby af-
fect the function and responses of many types of 
cells (Fig. 3).

Trans fats appear to affect lipid metabolism 
through several pathways. In vitro, trans fatty acids 
alter the secretion, lipid composition, and size of 
apolipoprotein  B-100  (apoB-100)  particles  pro-
duced by hepatic cells.47,48 Such alteration is paral-
leled in studies in humans by decreased rates of 
LDL apoB-100 catabolism,49 reductions in the size 
of LDL cholesterol particles,23 increased rates of 
apoA-I catabolism,49 and changes in serum lipid 
levels.20,22 Trans fatty acids also increase the cel-
lular accumulation and the secretion of free cho-
lesterol and cholesterol esters by hepocytes in 
vitro.47 In humans, the consumption of trans fat 
increases plasma activity of cholesteryl ester trans-
fer protein,50 the main enzyme for the transfer 
of cholesterol esters from HDL to LDL and very-
low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol. This 
increased activity may explain decreases in the 
levels of HDL and increases in the levels of LDL 
and  VLDL  cholesterol  seen  with  intake  of  trans 
fatty acids.20,22

The cellular mechanisms relating trans fats to 
inflammatory pathways and other, nonlipid path-
ways  are  not  well  established.  Monocytes  and 
macrophages,  endothelial  cells,  and  adipocytes 
may each play a role. Trans fatty acids modulate 
monocyte and macrophage responses in humans, 
increasing the production by monocytes of TNF-α 
and  interleukin-627  and  possibly  also  levels  of 
monocyte chemoattractant protein 1.26 Trans fats 
also affect vascular function. Trans fats have been 
shown to increase circulating biomarkers of en-
dothelial dysfunction25,28 and to impair nitric ox-
ide–dependent arterial dilatation.34 Trans fatty

acids also influence fatty acid metabolism of adi-
pocytes, resulting in reduced triglyceride uptake, 
reduced esterification of newly synthesized choles-
terol, and increased production of free fatty ac-
ids.51 The effects of adiposity on the relations 
between intake of trans fat and circulating inter-
leukin-6 and C-reactive protein levels suggest that 
the inflammatory effects of trans fats may be 
partially mediated by adipose tissue.24 In studies 
of animals, the consumption of trans fat alters the 
expression in adipocytes of genes for peroxisome-
proliferator–activated receptor-γ, resistin, and lipo-
protein lipase,52 compounds with central roles in 
the metabolism of fatty acids and glucose.45 Thus, 
there are several possible mechanisms whereby 
trans fats may affect both lipid and nonlipid risk 
factors for cardiovascular disease. Each of these 
pathways warrants additional investigation, par-
ticularly the potential influence of trans fatty ac-
ids on nuclear receptors, membrane receptors, and 
membrane fluidity.

INTAK E OF TR ANS FAT 

AND CAR DIOVASCUL AR DISE ASE

In our opinion, conducting randomized long-term 
trials to test the effects of trans fat intake on the 
incidence of cardiovascular events would be un-
ethical, given the adverse effects of trans fats on 
serum lipid levels and inflammation. Therefore, 
in addition to short-term randomized trials of in-
termediate end points, carefully performed obser-
vational studies provide a reasonable approach for 
evaluating the effects of trans fat on cardiovascu-
lar health.

CHD
On a per-calorie basis, trans fats appear to increase 
the risk of CHD more than any other macronutri-
ent, conferring a substantially increased risk at 
low levels of consumption (1 to 3 percent of total 
energy intake).22,53-55 In a meta-analysis of four 
prospective cohort studies involving nearly 140,000

* Values are based on national brands that contain partially hydrogenated vegetable oils and that were sold in the United 

States in 2002. These same foods will contain little or no trans fatty acids if produced or prepared with other fats or 
oils, such as unhydrogenated vegetable oils or fully (not partially) hydrogenated vegetable oils. Very small amounts of 
trans fatty acids (less than 2 percent) may be formed during deodorization of vegetable oil, a process unrelated to par-
tial hydrogenation. Dairy and meat products from cows, sheep, and other ruminants contain small amounts (1 to 8 percent 
of total fatty acids) of naturally occurring trans fatty acids produced by the action of bacteria in the ruminant stomach. 
Data are from the Harvard Food Composition Database.

† For french fries and margarines, the top national brands were analyzed individually for fatty acid composition with the 
use of gas chromatography (Harvard Biomarker Laboratory, Dr. Hannia Campos); the ranges are shown. For the other 
foods, the top national brands were combined into one sample for analysis. The proportion of the total sample that 
each brand constituted was determined by the brand’s percent market share in the national marketplace, as determined 
from market-share and consumption statistics (TableBase, Responsive Database Services) and from Harvard cohort 
 pilot consumption data representing a national sample.

‡ The contents and types of partially hydrogenated oils were determined from recipe information (Harvard Food Com po-
sition Database, based on packaging and USDA sources), and the trans fatty acid content of these oils was calculated 
on the basis of gas-chromatography analysis of similar foods. For the fast or frozen foods, the trans fat content of the 
oils was calculated from the fatty acid composition of the oils in french fries; for granola bars, from a mix of partially hydro-
genated soybean oil and household vegetable shortening; and for breakfast bars, from household vegetable shortening.

subjects,53-56 including updated analyses from the 
two largest studies, a 2 percent increase in ener-
gy intake from trans fatty acids was associated 
with a 23 percent increase in the incidence of CHD 
(pooled relative risk, 1.23; 95 percent confidence 
interval, 1.11 to 1.37; P<0.001) (Fig. 4).

The relation between trans fatty acid levels in 
adipose tissue, a biomarker of the dietary intake 
of trans fats, and the risk of nonfatal myocar-
dial infarction has also been evaluated in three 
retrospective case–control studies58-60 (Fig. 4). The 
addition of these studies to the meta-analysis in-
creased the magnitude of the association between 
trans fatty acids and the risk of CHD (pooled rela-
tive risk in prospective and retrospective studies, 
1.29; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.11 to 1.49; 
P<0.001). Clifton et al. showed that the positive 
association between levels of trans fat in adipose 
tissue and the risk of nonfatal myocardial infarc-

tion was mitigated after 1996, when trans fats 
were eliminated from margarines sold in Australia 
and trans fat levels decreased in both case patients 
and controls.60

Sudden Death from Cardiac Causes
Some data suggest that trans fatty acids may in-
crease the risk of sudden death from cardiac causes. 
In a study that compared adipose tissue obtained 
at autopsy from 66 patients with sudden death 
from cardiac causes with that obtained from 286 
healthy age- and sex-matched controls, levels of 
trans fat were not found to be associated with 
sudden death from cardiac causes.61 In contrast, 
in a larger, community-based case–control study 
(179 cases), levels of trans fatty acids in erythro-
cyte membranes were associated with an increase 
in the risk of sudden cardiac death (odds ratio for 
interquintile  range,  1.47;  95  percent  confidence

interval, 1.01 to 2.13), after adjustment for other 
risk factors.62 When different trans-isomers were 
evaluated separately, the increased risk appeared 
to be related to the 18-carbon isomers (trans-18:1 
and especially trans-18:2); similar isomer-specific 
relations were seen in studies evaluating system-
ic  inflammation.24-26  After  adjustment  for  the 
levels of other membrane fatty acids, higher trans-
18:2 levels were associated with a tripling of the 
risk of sudden death from cardiac causes (odds 
ratio for interquintile range, 3.05; 95 percent con-
fidence interval, 1.71 to 5.44).62

Diabetes
Three prospective studies have investigated the 
relation between the intake of trans fatty acids 
and the incidence of diabetes. Consumption of 
trans fat was not significantly associated with the 
risk of diabetes in two of these studies — among 
male health professionals63 and among women 
in Iowa.64 However, the intake of trans fatty acids 
was significantly related to the risk of diabetes 
among 84,941 female nurses who were followed 
for 16 years and in whom self-reported diabetes 
was validated and information on dietary intake 

was periodically updated.65 After adjustment for 
other risk factors, trans fat intake was positively 
associated with the incidence of diabetes (P<0.001 
for trend), with a risk 39 percentage points great-
er in the highest quintile (relative risk, 1.39; 95 per-
cent confidence interval, 1.23 to 1.56) than in the 
lowest quintile. 

What might account for the different results of 
these studies? The intake of trans fat was relatively 
low among the male health professionals (overall 
median intake was 1.3 percent of energy, equal to 
the median intake in the lowest quintile among the 
nurses)55; the smaller range of intake may have 
limited the ability to detect a difference in the risk 
of diabetes. In the Iowa cohort, a validation study 
suggested that the self-reported diagnosis of dia-
betes was incorrect in 36 percent of subjects, and 
diet was assessed only at baseline and may have 
changed over time.64 Misclassification of both the 
exposure and outcome variables would bias the 
results toward a null association. Alternatively, 
the intake of trans fat may not be an important 
risk factor for new-onset diabetes; additional stud-
ies are needed. Molecular mechanisms that might 
account for an effect of trans fatty acids on the

Figure 3. Potential Physiological Effects of Trans Fatty Acids. 
Changes in hepatocyte production, secretion, and catabolism of lipoproteins, together with effects on plasma cholesteryl ester transfer 
protein (CETP), probably account for adverse effects of trans fatty acids on serum lipid levels (Panel A). The effect on CETP is probably 
not direct but mediated through effects on membrane or nuclear receptors (dashed line). Trans fatty acids also alter fatty acid metabolism 
and, possibly, inflammatory responses of adipocytes. In addition, nitric oxide–dependent endothelial dysfunction and increased levels of circu-
lating adhesion molecules (soluble intercellular adhesion molecule 1 [sICAM-1] and soluble vascular-cell adhesion molecule 1 [sVCAM-1]) 
are seen with trans fat intake. Trans fatty acids also modulate monocyte and macrophage activity (Panel D), as manifested by increased 
production of inflammatory mediators. Each of these effects has been seen in controlled studies in humans and may, individually or in 
concert, increase the risk of atherosclerosis, plaque rupture, sudden death from cardiac causes, and diabetes. The subcellular mechanisms 
for these effects are not well established, but they may be mediated by effects on membrane receptors that localize with and are influenced 
by specific membrane phospholipids (Panel B), such as endothelial nitric oxide (NO) synthase or toll-like receptors; by direct binding of 
trans fatty acids to nuclear receptors regulating gene transcription, such as liver X receptor (Panel C); and by direct or indirect effects on 
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) responses, such as activation of Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). Such hypothesized subcellular pathways — 
which have been shown to exist for other fatty acids — require further investigation. TNF-α denotes tumor necrosis factor α, ROS reac-
tive oxygen species, NF-κB nuclear factor κB, and mRNA messenger RNA.

In the prospective studies,53-56 the risk of CHD is shown for the isocaloric substitution of 2 percent of the total energy 
intake of carbohydrates with trans fatty acids. Among the retrospective studies, the risk of nonfatal myocardial infarc-
tion was evaluated for extreme quartiles of adipose trans fatty acid levels (approximately equal to a 1.5 to 2 percent 
difference in energy intake) in the European Community Multicenter Study on Antioxidants, Myocardial Infarction 
and Cancer [EURAMIC]58 and in the Costa Rican study59 or for a difference of 1 SD in adipose trans fatty acid levels 
in the Australian study.60 Pooled relative risks were calculated with use of random effects meta-analysis with inverse-
variance weighting.57 The original analysis of the Health Professionals Follow-up study was published in 199656 and 
now has been updated to include more than 14 years of follow-up and updated dietary information. The relative risk 
in EURAMIC was 1.44 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.94 to 2.20) after the exclusion of two Spanish centers in 
which adipose trans fat levels were extremely low (P<0.05 for the interaction with center)58; the use of this result 
did not greatly affect the overall pooled estimate (relative risk, 1.32; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.15 to 1.51; 
P<0.001). Arrowheads on 95 percent confidence intervals indicate that the intervals extend beyond the x-axis values 
shown.

incidence of diabetes are not well established, but 
evidence of effects of trans fatty acids on metabo-
lism in adipocytes52 and on systemic inflamma-
tion24-28 suggests plausible pathways.

TR ANS FAT T Y ACIDS 
FROM RUMINANTS 

Most trans fats in the U.S. diet are produced in-
dustrially during the partial hydrogenation of veg-
etable oils. However, smaller amounts are pres-
ent in dairy products and in meat from cows, 
sheep, and other ruminants, produced by bacte-
ria in their stomachs. The predominant trans-iso-
mer in ruminants is vaccenic acid, from which con-
jugated linolenic acid (another trans fatty acid) can 
be formed. It is possible to change the trans fatty 
acid content of ruminant products to some degree 

by altering the animals’ feed,66 although levels of 
trans fat in milk and meats are already relatively 
low (1 to 8 percent of total fats).

In fact, most efforts have focused on increas-
ing, rather than decreasing, the levels of conju-
gated linolenic acid in ruminant products, owing 
to its hypothesized health benefits for humans. 
However, the evidence of such benefits is incon-
clusive. For example, dietary trials indicate that 
consumption of conjugated linolenic acid reduces 
insulin sensitivity, increases lipid peroxidation, 
and has mixed effects on markers of inflamma-
tion and immune function.40,41,67,68

Of four prospective studies evaluating the rela-
tion between the intake of trans fatty acids from 
ruminants and the risk of CHD, none identified 
a significant positive association, whereas three 
identified nonsignificant trends toward an in-

verse association.53,54,69,70 The absence of a higher 
risk of CHD associated with the intake of trans 
fatty acids from ruminants as compared with the 
intake of industrially produced trans fatty acids 
may be due to lower levels of intake (typically less 
than 0.5 percent of total energy intake), different 
biologic  effects  (ruminant  and  industrial  trans 
fats share some, but not all, isomers), or the pres-
ence of other factors in dairy and meat products 
that balance any effects of the small amount of 
trans fats they contain. Although each of these 
potential explanations deserves further investiga-
tion, the sum of the  current  evidence  suggests 
that the public health implications of consuming 
trans fats from ruminant products are relatively 
limited.

R EDUCING INTAK E 

OF TR ANS FAT T Y ACIDs

Optimal Levels
To determine the optimal level of intake for a nu-
trient, both the risks and benefits should be con-
sidered. Given the adverse effects of trans fatty 
acids on serum lipid levels, systemic inflamma-
tion, and possibly other risk factors for cardiovas-
cular disease and the positive associations with the 
risk of CHD, sudden death from cardiac causes, 
and possibly diabetes, the potential for harm is 
clear. The evidence and the magnitude of adverse 
health effects of trans fatty acids are in fact far 
stronger on average than those of food contami-
nants or pesticide residues, which have in some 
cases received considerable attention.71 Further-
more, trans fats from partially hydrogenated oils 
have no intrinsic health value above their caloric 
value. Thus, from a nutritional standpoint, the 
consumption of trans fatty acids results in con-
siderable potential harm but no apparent benefit. 
In addition, adverse effects are seen even at low 
levels of intake: 1 to 3 percent of total energy in-
take, or approximately 20 to 60 calories (2 to 7 g) 
for a person consuming 2000 calories per day. 
Thus, complete or near-complete avoidance of in-
dustrially produced trans fats — consumption of 
less than 0.5 percent of the total energy intake 
— may be necessary to avoid adverse effects and 
would be prudent to minimize health risks.

Consumers’ Choices
The intake of trans fat can be reduced by con-
sumers’ decisions to choose foods free of trans 

fatty acids, assisted by advice from health care 
providers  about  how  to  avoid  the  main  foods 
containing trans fats (Table 1). Physicians and oth-
er health care providers can also support insti-
tutional changes to reduce the use of trans fat in 
food  services  at  schools,  hospitals,  and  other 
work sites. 

The  amounts  of  trans  fat  in  foods  can  vary 
widely depending on the content of partially hy-
drogenated oils, with some foods containing little 
or no trans fatty acids and other, similar foods 
containing high levels.72 The mandatory specifi-
cation of trans fat content on the nutrition labels 
of foods2 should facilitate the avoidance of trans 
fatty acids, but only if consumers read the labels 
and base their decisions on what they read. How-
ever,  the  producers  of  foods  that  contain  less 
than 500 mg of trans fatty acids per serving will 
be allowed to list the content of trans fatty acids 
as 0 on the packaging, so even consumers who 
read the labels might unwittingly consume sub-
stantial amounts of trans fats in multiple serv-
ings (for example, several pats of margarine or 
several cookies per day). Inspection of the ingre-
dients list for the content of partially hydroge-
nated oils will be the only way to identify these 
foods. (Fully hydrogenated oils are typically listed 
simply  as  “hydrogenated”  and  do  not  contain 
trans fatty acids.) More important, food labels are 
not obligatory (and are rarely seen) in restau-
rants, bakeries, and many other retail food out-
lets. Avoidance of trans fats at these sites will de-
pend on consumers’ knowledge of the type and 
quantity of oils used in food preparation. Acquir-
ing this knowledge is a potentially daunting but 
important task, because as trans fatty acids are 
increasingly  eliminated  from  packaged  foods, 
most trans fats will be consumed from food ob-
tained at these sites.

Industry Alternatives
Trans  fat  intake  could  also  be  reduced  if  food 
manufacturers and restaurants choose to use al-
ternatives to partially hydrogenated oils. To max-
imize  health  benefits,  such  alternatives  should 
be low in both trans and saturated fats. Although 
concerns have been raised that decreasing the 
use of partially hydrogenated oils would increase 
the cost of certain foods and reduce their palat-
ability, recent experience in European countries 
suggests that such concerns are overstated.6,73-75 
For example, in 2004, Denmark mandated that

Reduction by half
Near-elimination
Population Change in Trans Fatty Acid Intake

Figure 5. Estimated Effects of Reducing the Consumption of Industrially 
Produced Trans Fatty Acids on the Incidence of CHD (Nonfatal Myocardial 
Infarction or Death from CHD) in the United States. 
Population attributable risks were calculated for a reduction by approxi-
mately half in the percent of energy intake (from 2.1 percent to 1.1 percent) 
or the near-elimination (from 2.1 percent to 0.1 percent) of trans fatty acid 
intake. Three effects were estimated: based on the effects of isocaloric re-
placement of trans fats with cis mono- or polyunsaturated fats (averaged 
effect) on the ratio of total to HDL cholesterol in controlled trials (as shown 
in Fig. 2) and the relation of this ratio to the incidence of CHD21; based on 
the reported relation of trans fatty acid intake, substituted for carbohydrate 
intake, with the incidence of CHD in a pooled analysis of prospective stud-
ies (as shown in Fig. 4); and based on the additional potential benefits if 
trans fats were replaced with cis mono- or polyunsaturated fats (averaged 
effect), as calculated from the pooled analysis of the prospective studies 
and the difference in relative risk resulting from trans fats being replaced 
by carbohydrates as compared with cis unsaturated fats in updated 2005 
analyses from two cohorts.55,56

all oils and fats used in locally made or imported 
foods must contain less than 2 percent industri-
ally produced trans fatty acids. This legislation 
essentially eliminated the use of partially hydro-
genated vegetable oils in Denmark.6 Comparisons 
of foods before and after the legislation demon-
strated that partially hydrogenated oils were re-
placed mostly with cis unsaturated fatty acids in 
soft margarines, packaged snacks, and fast foods, 
with some saturated fatty acids from tropical oils 
or fully hydrogenated vegetable oils used in cer-
tain cookies and bakery products.6 Overall, the 
consumption  of  saturated  fat  did  not  increase. 
Both government and industry representatives 
agreed that these changes did not appreciably af-
fect the quality, cost, or availability of food.6,73,74 
Thus, french fries and chicken nuggets from U.S. 

fast-food restaurants located in Denmark contain 
virtually no trans fatty acids, whereas the same 
foods in the United States contain 5 to 10 g of 
trans  fatty  acids  per  serving  (as  discussed  by 
Stender et al. elsewhere in this issue of the Jour-
nal 75). In Norway, Finland, and the Netherlands, 
cooperative efforts between government agencies 
and food industries have also resulted in substan-
tial reductions in the use and consumption of 
trans fat without notable increases in the cost of 
foods or reductions in the quality or availability 
of foods.76

Some food manufacturers in the United States 
have voluntarily reduced their use of partially hy-
drogenated vegetable oils.77,78 Many products that 
contained trans fatty acids in the past are now 
available  in  formulations  that  are  free  of  trans 
fatty acids. The mandated labeling of trans fat 
content2 may provide an additional impetus for 
such changes. It has been noted that the FDA ac-
knowledges the potential harm of consumption 
of any amount of industrially produced trans fat, 
yet it also maintains that partially hydrogenated 
oils are basically safe.79 A petition to the FDA calls 
for a removal of partially hydrogenated oils from 
the “generally regarded as safe” category80 — that 
is, “generally recognized, among qualified experts, 
as having been adequately shown to be safe un-
der the conditions of its intended use.”81 Doing 
so would effectively eliminate the consumption 
of industrially produced trans fatty acids in the 
United States. On the basis of experience in Eu-
rope, substantial reduction in the use of partially 
hydrogenated oils appears to be a feasible goal in 
the United States and could be effected through 
either  legislation  or  voluntary  efforts  by  food 
manufacturers.

Potential Benefits of Reducing Intake
We calculated the potential effect of reducing the 
intake of industrially produced trans fatty acids 
on the incidence of CHD in the United States 
(Fig. 5). On the basis of the predicted changes in 
total and HDL cholesterol levels alone (Fig. 2),21 
a  meaningful  proportion  of  CHD  events  (3  to 
6 percent) would be averted. However, we believe 
that this reduction is an underestimate, since trans 
fats may also influence the risk of CHD through 
other mechanisms, such as inflammatory or en-
dothelial effects. On the basis of reported rela-
tions between trans fat intake and CHD events in 
prospective studies (Fig. 4), which may account

more satisfactorily for the total effects of trans 
fatty acids, 10 to 19 percent of CHD events in the 
United States could be averted by reducing the 
intake of trans fat. Thus, given the 1.2 million 
annual myocardial infarctions and deaths from 
CHD in the United States,82 near-elimination of 
industrially produced trans fats might avert be-
tween  72,000  (6  percent)  and  228,000  (19  per-
cent) CHD events each year. 

These estimates are based on the replacement 
of trans fats with carbohydrates. In practice, how-
ever,  trans  fats  in  partially  hydrogenated  oils 
would most commonly be replaced with unhydro-
genated (cis) unsaturated fats,6 which may have 
additional  potential  benefits  as  compared  with 
carbohydrates. If such additional potential ben-
efit  is  considered,  greater  proportions  of  CHD 
events (12 to 22 percent) might be averted (Fig. 
5). Partial hydrogenation also largely destroys α-
linolenic  acid,  the  plant-based  n−3  fatty  acid. 
Although the cardiovascular benefits of α-lino-
lenic  acid  are  not  established  conclusively,83  the 
replacement of partially hydrogenated fats with 
unhydrogenated oils containing α-linolenic acid 
(such  as  soybean  oil)  may  further  reduce  the 
risk of CHD by increasing the population intake 
of n−3 fatty acids.

Conclusions

On the basis of evidence from in vitro experimen-
tal studies, dietary trials, and prospective obser-

vational studies, the consumption of trans fatty 
acids from partially hydrogenated oils provides 
no apparent nutritional benefit and has consider-
able potential for harm. Although the elimina-
tion of partially hydrogenated oils from foods may 
be challenging for restaurants and food manu-
facturers in the United States, experience in other 
countries indicates that such fats can largely be 
replaced by cis unsaturated fats without increas-
ing the cost or reducing the quality or availability 
of foods. Health care providers should advise con-
sumers about how to minimize the intake of trans 
fats, consumers should recognize and avoid prod-
ucts containing trans fats and restaurants and food 
manufacturers should choose to use alternative 
fats in food production and preparation. These 
steps should help reduce the consumption of trans 
fatty acids, possibly resulting in substantial health 
benefits such as averting thousands of CHD events 
each year in the United States.
