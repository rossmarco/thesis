                       Background:   Preclinical and observational studies suggest a 
relationship between dietary fat intake and breast cancer, 
but the association remains controversial. We carried out a 
randomized,  prospective,  multicenter  clinical  trial  to  test 
the  effect  of  a  dietary  intervention  designed  to  reduce  fat 
intake  in  women  with  resected,  early-stage  breast  cancer 
receiving  conventional  cancer  management.    Methods:    A 
total  of  2437  women  were  randomly  assigned  between 
February  1994  and  January  2001  in  a  ratio  of  40  :  60  to 
dietary intervention (n = 975) or control (n = 1462) groups. 
An interim analysis was performed after a median follow-
up of 60 months when funding for the intervention ceased. 
Mean differences between dietary intervention and control 
groups  in  nutrient  intakes  and  anthropometric  variables 
were compared with   t   tests. Relapse-free survival was exam-
ined using Kaplan – Meier analysis, stratiﬁ ed log-rank tests, 
and Cox proportional hazards models. Statistical tests were 
two-sided.   Results:   Dietary fat intake was lower in the inter-
vention  than  in  the  control  group  (fat  grams/day  at  12 
months, 33.3 [95% conﬁ dence interval {CI} = 32.2 to 34.5] 
versus 51.3 [95% CI = 50.0 to 52.7], respectively;   P  <.001), 
corresponding  to  a  statistically  signiﬁ cant  (  P    =  .005), 
6-pound lower mean body weight in the intervention group. 
A total of 277 relapse events (local, regional, distant, or ipsi-
lateral breast cancer recurrence or new contralateral breast 
cancer) have been reported in 96 of 975 (9.8%) women in 
the  dietary  group  and  181  of  1462  (12.4%)  women  in  the 
control  group.  The  hazard  ratio  of  relapse  events  in  the 
intervention  group  compared  with  the  control  group  was 
0.76 (95% CI = 0.60 to 0.98,   P   = .077 for stratiﬁ ed log rank 
and   P   = .034 for adjusted Cox model analysis). Exploratory 
analyses suggested a differential effect of the dietary inter-
vention based on hormonal receptor status.   Conclusions:   A 
lifestyle intervention reducing dietary fat intake, with mod-
est inﬂ uence on body weight, may improve relapse-free sur-
vival of breast cancer patients re ceiving conventional cancer 
management.  Longer,  ongoing  nonintervention  follow-up 
will address original protocol design plans, which called for 
3 years of follow-up after completion of recruitment.   [J Natl 
Cancer Inst 2006;98: 1767  –  76 ]   

  The  question  of  the  inﬂ uence  of  dietary  fat  on  breast 
cancer has been controversial. Whereas preclinical and human 

ecologic studies have suggested an association of higher di-
etary  fat  intake  with  breast  cancer  risk   ( 1 , 2 ) ,  cohort  studies 
have reported less consistent effects  ( 3  –  5 ) . Similarly, observa-
tional studies of dietary fat inﬂ uence on breast cancer recur-
rence have had mixed results  ( 6 , 7 ) , with some suggesting that 
higher fat intake is associated with higher risk of recurrence, 
especially in postmenopausal women  ( 8  –  10 ) . The varying as-
sociations may be due to the modest range of fat intake seen 
and the difﬁ culty in accurately measuring fat intake with cur-
rent methods  ( 11 , 12 ) . 

 Feasibility trials have demonstrated that dietary fat reduction 
can  be  achieved  within  the  context  of  standard  multimodality 
breast  cancer  management  (  13 , 14  ). The Women’s  Intervention 
Nutrition Study (WINS) was subsequently designed to test the 
hypothesis  that  a  dietary  intervention  targeting  fat  intake

sected breast cancer. 

  P ATIENTS  AND  M ETHODS  

  Study Overview 

 In this phase III multicenter randomized trial, the effect on 
relapse of a dietary intervention designed to reduce fat intake 
was compared with that of a control condition with minimal 
 dietary counseling in women with early-stage, resected breast 
cancer receiving conventional cancer management. Patients in 
this  study  were  accrued  in  approximately  7  years,  between 
February  1994  and  January  2001.  This  report  represents  an 
interim analysis after a median of 60 months of follow-up. The 
WINS trial protocol is available online as supplementary data 
at    http://jncicancerspectrum.oxfordjournals.org/jnci/content/
vol98/issue24  .  

  Study Population 

 Women  were  recruited  from  39  clinical  centers.  Eligibility 
criteria  included  histologically  conﬁ rmed,  resected,  unilateral 
invasive breast carcinoma; lymph node evaluation; age between 
48 and 79 years; life expectancy of at least 10 years excluding 
the cancer diagnosis; acceptable adjuvant systemic therapy (see 
below);  at  least  20%  of  calories  obtained  from  fat;  medically 
able to accept either randomization assignment; and trial entry 
within 365 days of surgery. Exclusion criteria included inﬂ am-
matory carcinoma; chest wall or skin involved; tumor size less 
than 1 cm with negative nodes; tumor size greater than 5 cm with 
positive nodes; 10 or more nodes positive; preoperative chemo-
therapy; or any previous neoplasm other than carcinoma in situ 
of the cervix or basal cell skin carcinoma. Eligibility was con-
ﬁ rmed by central review of medical records and pathology re-
ports.  The  Institutional  Review  Board  of  each  participating 
institution approved the study protocol. All patients gave written 
informed consent.  

  Standard Breast Cancer Management 

 Standard  breast  cancer  management  was  protocol  de  ﬁ ned, 
including adequate surgery and radiotherapy. Estrogen receptor 
(ER)  and  progesterone  receptor  (PgR)  status  (positive  or 
negative) was deﬁ ned by local laboratory standards. Women with 
ER-positive  tumors  received  tamoxifen  (20  mg  per  day)  for  5 
years. Chemotherapy with a protocol-approved regimen (adria-
mycin plus cyclophosphamide; cyclophosphamide plus metho-
trexate  plus  5-ﬂ uorouracil  in  two  schedules;  5-ﬂ uorouracil 
plus  adriamycin  plus  cyclophosphamide  in  two  schedules  [5-
 ﬂ uoruracil – adriamycin – cyclophosphamide or cyclophosphamide
 – adriamycin – fluorouracil]; or adriamycin – cyclophosphamide 
followed by paclitaxel) was required for women with ER- negative 
tumors  and  optional  for  those  with  ER-positive  tumors. As  an 
eligibility  criterion,  chemotherapy  had  to  be  initiated  within  4 
months  after  diagnosis  for  women  given  chemotherapy,  and 
tamoxifen had to be initiated within 6 months after diagnosis for 
those  given  only  tamoxifen.  Recommended  drug  dosages  and 
schedules paralleled those in use by cooperative group trials at 
the time  ( 15  –  17 ).   

  Randomization 

 Adaptive randomization was carried out at the Statistical Co-
ordinating Unit of the WINS study using a random stratiﬁ ed per-
muted block design. The trial was designed with an unbalanced 
randomization (60% control subjects, 40% dietary intervention 
subjects) to facilitate resource allocation to the dietary interven-
tion. Women  were  initially  stratiﬁ ed  according  to  lymph  node 
status  (negative  or  positive)  and  systemic  adjuvant  therapy 
 received  (tamoxifen  alone,  tamoxifen  plus  chemotherapy,  or 
 chemotherapy  alone). An  additional  stratum  for  sentinel  node 
evaluation (yes or no) was introduced in 1999 to reﬂ ect clinical 
practice trends.  

  Dietary Intervention and Study Assessments 

 The goal of the dietary intervention was to reduce percentage 
of  calories  from  fat  to  15%  while  maintaining  nutritional 
adequacy. Feasibility studies had indicated that this goal would 
result in a sustained reduction in fat intake to approximately 20% 
of calories  ( 14 ) , which was the basis for the sample size calcula-
tion.  Women  in  the  dietary  intervention  group  were  given  an 
individual fat gram goal and counseled by registered dieticians 
who  implemented  a  previously  developed  low-fat  eating  plan 
 ( 14  –  18 ) .  Study  dieticians  were  trained  centrally  on  diet  inter-
vention and dietary and anthropometric data collection. Training 
continued with annual workshops incorporating training on mo-
tivational interviewing and with monthly conference calls. 

 The low-fat eating plan, which was based on nutritional and 
behavioral science principles  ( 18 ) , incorporated social cognitive 
theory and included self-monitoring (fat gram counting and re-
cording), goal setting, modeling, social support, and relapse pre-
vention and management. Individual fat gram goals were based 
on energy intake needed to maintain weight, and no counseling 
on weight reduction was provided. The low-fat eating plan was 
initiated during eight biweekly individual, in-person counseling 
sessions, each lasting approximately 1 hour. Subsequent dietician 
contacts (visits or calls) occurred every 3 months, with available, 
optional monthly dietary group sessions. Women in the dietary 
intervention group were instructed to keep a written record of 
their fat gram intake daily throughout the trial using a previously 
developed  “ keeping score ”  book  ( 18 ) . Control subjects had one 
baseline  dietician  visit  and  contacts  with  a  dietician  every  3 
months  subsequently.  They  received  written  information  on 
general  dietary  guidelines  and  were  counseled  on  nutritional 
adequacy for vitamin and mineral intake only. 

 Questionnaires administered at baseline were used to collect 
information on demographic characteristics; medical, reproduc-
tive,  and  family  history;  personal  habits  such  as  smoking  and 
alcohol use; prior use of menopausal hormone therapy and oral 
contraceptives;  and  current  use  of  medications  and  dietary 
supplements. Weight and height were measured at baseline and 
annually using standardized techniques on calibrated scales/stadi-
ometer  ( 19 ) . Body mass index (BMI) was calculated as weight (in 
kilograms) divided by height (in meters) squared. 

 Unannounced telephone calls were used to estimate dietary 
intakes. Trained interviewers who were blinded to randomization 
status collected dietary information; the information was entered 
into the Nutrition Data System for Research interactive software 
as  previously  described   ( 18 ) .  A  multilayered  quality  control 
process was used to maintain nutrition data quality  ( 20 ) . Data on

dietary  intakes  from  three  follow-up  calls  (including  one  on  a 
weekend day) were collected over 2 weeks for eligibility deter-
mination regarding dietary fat intake. Two additional follow-up 
calls (including one on a weekend day) were made annually to 
collect updated data on dietary intakes for all women. 

 Recurrence  information  was  solicited  during  the  every-3-
month dietician contacts. Recurrences were conﬁ rmed initially 
by medical record and pathology report review by the clinical 
director  (RTC)  and  subsequently  by  the  WINS  Pathology 
 Committee, both of whom were blinded to random assignment.  

  Outcome Deﬁ nitions 

 The primary study endpoint was relapse-free survival, deﬁ ned 
as the time from random assignment to breast cancer recurrence 
at any site. Relapse events included local, regional, and distant 
recurrence; ipsilateral breast recurrence after lumpectomy; and 
contralateral breast cancer. Overall survival, deﬁ ned as the time 
from randomization to death from any cause, was a secondary 
endpoint. For comparability to other adjuvant trials  ( 15 , 21  –  24 ) , 
disease-free  survival  and  recurrence-free  survival  were  also 
examined. Disease-free survival events included any secondary 
invasive  cancers,  excluding  basal  and  squamous  skin  cancers, 
and  death  without  breast  cancer  recurrence.  Recurrence-free 
survival  events  included  local,  regional,  distant,  or  ipsilateral 
breast  recurrence  after  lumpectomy  but  excluded  contralateral 
breast cancer. Breast cancer size and nodal status were used to 
calculate tumor size – node – metastasis stage  ( 25 )  at baseline.  

  Termination of the Dietary Intervention 

 WINS  was  supported  by  a  multicenter  RO1  grant  from  the 
National Cancer Institute, with continued funding dependent on 
ongoing  peer  review.  Funding  for  the  clinical  centers  and  the 
active dietary intervention ended in May 2004, even though the 
protocol-deﬁ ned follow-up period had not been completed and 
even  though  secular  trends  in  therapy  had  reduced  recurrence 
events compared with the number of events projected at the time 
the study was designed. The WINS External Advisory Commit-
tee reviewed results of the last (November 2003) interim analysis 
(which incorporated nutrient data through August 31, 2003, and 
all  available  efﬁ cacy  data  through  October  31,  2003),  after  a 
median  follow-up  of  60  months.  Based  on  the  change  in  trial 
status,  both  the  WINS  External  Advisory  Committee  and  the 
WINS  Executive  Committee  supported  reporting  the  available 
results but recognized the need for additional follow-up. These 
results were presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncol-
ogy annual meeting  ( 26 )  on May 17, 2005, and were provided to 
study participants by mail. This interim efﬁ cacy report provides 
details of that dataset. The protocol design called for 3 years of 
follow-up after completion of recruitment through January 2004. 
Currently  ongoing  nonintervention  follow-up  will  address  the 
original design plans.  

  Statistical Analysis 

 Sample size was based on a model that generated power esti-
mates via simulation. Using published information from cooper-
ative group trials involving tamoxifen  ( 27 , 28  ), we calculated a 
total sample size of 2502 under assumptions of 6 years of ac-
crual,  3  years  of  follow-up  after  completion  of  accrual,  and  a 

7.5% increase in relapse-free survival with a drop-in (deﬁ ned as 
control group women with intake <20% of calories from fat at 
any interval while on study) rate of 10% and a drop-out rate of 
30% for 84% power at a two-sided alpha level of .05. 

 The primary efﬁ cacy analysis was a stratiﬁ ed log-rank test. 
Exploratory  Cox  proportional  hazards  models  for  relapse-free 
survival  were  investigated,  as  were  various  Cox  models  for 
prognostic  factors  in  addition  to  those  used  in  the  stratiﬁ ed 
randomization. The ﬁ nal Cox model included randomized group, 
stratiﬁ cation  factors  (ER  status  [positive  versus  negative]  and 
tumor size [<2 versus  ≥ 2 cm]), and surgery type (mastectomy 
versus  lumpectomy)  based  on  their  established  inﬂ uences  on 
breast cancer outcomes. The cumulative incidence method was 
applied for Cox model analyses. Model assessment suggested a 
reasonable data ﬁ t. The assumption of proportionality for Cox 
models was veriﬁ ed by graphical and numerical methods of Lin 
et al.  ( 29 ) . The  P  value for the Kolmogorov-type supremum test 
(for group) based on 1000 simulations was 0.5170, supporting 
the proportional hazards assumptions. 

 Analyses included all randomly assigned patients, following 
the intent-to-treat paradigm. All  P  values were derived from a 
two-sided  test  for  signiﬁ cance.  The  95%  conﬁ dence  interval 
(CI) for the hazard ratio (HR) was obtained for each term in the 
ﬁ nal Cox model, with particular attention to the interaction be-
tween treatment and other factors in the model. The  P  values and 
conﬁ dence intervals are exploratory. Five protocol-planned in-
terim  analyses  were  carried  out  between  February  2000  and 
November 2003. The Haybitle – Peto approach to the  α -spending 
function  was  used  to  account  for  interim  analyses   ( 30 ) .  The 
Kaplan – Meier method was used to calculate probability estimates 
for  relapse-free  and  overall  survival.  In  exploratory  analyses, 
which were not deﬁ ned prospectively, dietary effects on relapse-
free survival in subgroups based on BMI, hormone receptor sta-
tus, and nodal status were examined using the Cox model. Tests 
for interaction used Cox models and a likelihood ratio test. Dif-
ferences in baseline variables between and within groups were 
analyzed using  t  tests or paired  t  tests or the appropriate tests 
with categorical variables. The  t  tests were performed to com-
pare  differences  in  the  nutrient  intakes  and  anthropometric 
variables, and corresponding 95% conﬁ dence intervals are reported.   

  R ESULTS  

 A  total  of  2437  apparently  eligible  women  were  randomly 
 assigned, 975 to the dietary intervention group and 1462 to the 
control  group  ( Fig.  1 ).  Thirty-four  women  (12  in  the  dietary 
group and 22 in the control group) were subsequently found to 
be ineligible, most commonly based on a longer interval from 
diagnosis and/or use of other chemotherapy (n = 10), pagetoid 
nipple  involvement  (n  =  9),  or  size  or  margin  issues  (n  =  5). 
However, all randomly assigned patients are included in the pre-
sented analyses.     

 The  characteristics  of  the  participants  were  well  balanced 
across the two groups ( Table 1 ). The characteristics of the breast 
cancers  of  study  participants  and  the  therapy  given  for  these 
cancers by treatment group are provided in  Table 2 . Breast can-
cer characteristics were closely comparable in the two groups. 
Breast cancer therapy was also closely comparable in the two 
groups, except for the type of primary surgery. More women in 
the dietary intervention compared to control group had mastec-
tomy rather than breast-conserving therapy ( P  = .004).

 As of October 31, 2003, 95% of the women in the dietary in-
tervention group and 94% of those in the control group were be-
ing  followed  as  part  of  the  study  or  had  experienced  a  study 
event, with 84% of women in the dietary intervention group and 
89% of those in the control group contacted within 12 months of 
October  31,  2003  ( Fig.  1 ).  The  median  interval  between  last 
contact and the analysis closeout date was 2.6 months for women 
in the  dietary intervention group and 3.1 months for those in the 
control group. 

and supplement use. No adverse events were associated with 
the dietary intervention.     

 Body  weight  was  not  an  intervention  target.  However, 
there was a modest but statistically signiﬁ cant ( P  = .005) weight 
difference  of  about  6  pounds  between  groups,  with  dietary 
 intervention women weighing less through 5 years of observa-
tion. Changes in BMI in both groups reﬂ ect the weight changes 
observed ( Table 3 ).  

  Adherence to Dietary Intervention 

  Efﬁ cacy 

 The  dietary  intervention  adherence  results  are  based  on 
telephone  follow-up  calls. The  reported  dietary  intake  differ-
ences by randomization group over time are outlined in  Table 3 . 
In all, 80% of women provided dietary data for at least three 
time periods after baseline. After 1 year, mean daily fat gram 
intake was slightly reduced in the control group (from 56.3 g at 
baseline  to  51.3  g  at  12  months,  mean  difference  =   − 5.09  g, 
95% CI =  − 6.5 to  − 3.7,  P <.0001) but was reduced to a statisti-
cally  signiﬁ cantly  greater  extent  in  the  dietary  intervention 
group (from 57.3 g at baseline to 33.3 g at 12 months, mean 
difference  =   − 24.4  g,  95%  CI  =   − 26.1  to   − 22.6,   P <.0001; 
 P <.001 comparing the mean difference between groups). The 
difference in fat gram intake was maintained through 5 years 
(difference in fat grams per day in dietary versus control groups 
of  − 18.0 g [95% CI =  − 19.9 to  − 16.1] at 12 months and  − 19.0 g 
[95% CI =  − 22.1 to  − 16.0] at 60 months [both  P <.0001]). Sim-
ilar differences were seen for all fat categories and in percent-
age  of  calories  from  fat  ( Table  3 ).  In  addition,  energy  intake 
was somewhat lower and ﬁ ber intake slightly higher in inter-
vention  group  participants  ( Table  3 ).  Nutrient  adequacy  was 
maintained  in  both  groups,  with  the  exception  of  calcium, 
 vitamin  D,  and  vitamin  E,  for  which  intakes  were  somewhat 
below recommended levels at baseline and throughout the trial 
in both groups, a situation that was addressed with counseling 

 After  a  median  of  60  months,  277  relapse-free  survival 
events  and  389  disease-free  survival  events  were  reported 
( Table 4 ). Recurrence events were conﬁ rmed by central review 
in  99.5%  of  cases.  For  relapse-free  survival — the  primary 
 endpoint — the hazard ratio of an event in the dietary interven-
tion compared with the control group was 0.76 (95% CI = 0.60 
to 0.98) ( Fig. 2 ,  P  = .077 for stratiﬁ ed log rank and  P  = .034 for 
adjusted  Cox  model  analysis).  For  recurrence-free  survival 
(i.e., excluding contralateral breast cancers), the HR was 0.71 
(95% CI = 0.53 to 0.94; stratiﬁ ed log rank  P  = .050). For dis-
ease-free survival, the HR was 0.81 (95% CI = 0.65 to 0.99; 
stratiﬁ ed log rank  P  = .078). There was no difference in overall 
survival comparing women receiving the dietary intervention 
with control group women (HR = 0.89; 95% CI = 0.65 to 1.21; 
stratiﬁ ed log rank  P  = .56). Based on the effects on the pri -
mary endpoint, 38 women would need to adopt a lifestyle inter-
vention  reducing  dietary  fat  intake  to  prevent  one  additional 
breast cancer recurrence.             

 Dietary  intervention  effects  were  examined  based  on  BMI, 
hormone  receptor,  and  nodal  status  in  subgroup  analyses  by 
using  adjusted  Cox  model. A  total  of  eight  subgroup  analyses 
were performed, and none of the interactions tested were statisti-
cally signiﬁ cant. However, the dietary intervention had a greater 
effect  on  relapse-free  survival  in  women  with  ER-negative

  *  Relapse-free survival events include local, regional, and distant recurrence, 

ipsilateral breast recurrence after lumpectomy, and contralateral breast cancer.  

   †   Disease-free survival events include those for relapse-free survival and also 
include any secondary invasive cancer, excluding basal and squamous skin can-
cer, and death without breast cancer recurrence.  

  D ISCUSSION  

 WINS is, to our knowledge, the ﬁ rst large-scale randomized 
trial to test whether a dietary intervention can improve the clinical 
outcome of women with breast cancer. The WINS results indi-
cate that a lifestyle intervention designed to reduce dietary fat 
intake  can  be  successfully  implemented  in  women  with  early-
stage, resected breast cancer receiving conventional cancer man-
agement in a multicenter clinical trial setting. After approximately 
5 years of follow-up, women in the dietary intervention group 
had a 24% lower risk of relapse than those in the control group 
(HR  =  0.76;  95%  CI  =  0.60  to  0.98).  Although  these  results 
are suggestive of beneﬁ t for the dietary intervention, given the 
level of statistical signiﬁ cance ( P  = .034 for adjusted Cox model 
 analysis),  the  higher  relapse-free  survival  seen  in  the  dietary 
group could also be a result of chance.

   Fig. 3.     Kaplan – Meier estimates of relapse-free survival. ( A ) Estrogen receptor –
 positive  subjects.  ( B )  Estrogen  receptor – negative  subjects.  Number  of  events/
number of patients in the dietary intervention and control groups are indicated. 
Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% conﬁ dence intervals (CIs) were calculated from 
adjusted  Cox  proportional  hazard  model  comparisons  of  control  to  dietary 
intervention groups through the 60-month median follow-up period.  P  values are 
two-sided. Numbers of patients at risk are indicated below the graph.     

 Secondary analyses suggested a stronger effect for dietary fat 
reduction on breast cancer recurrence in women with hormone 
receptor – negative cancers compared with women whose cancers 
were  hormone  receptor  positive;  however,  the  interaction  be-
tween dietary intervention and hormone receptor status was not 
statistically signiﬁ cant. These ﬁ ndings are consistent with trends 
suggestive of a differential dietary inﬂ uence by hormone receptor 
status  on  breast  cancer  incidence  recently  described  in  the 
Women’s Health Initiative randomized primary prevention trial 
and in a Nurse’s Health Study cohort  ( 31 , 32 ) . A differential inﬂ u-
ence of dietary fat on breast cancer recurrence based on hormone 
 receptor  status  will  require  conﬁ rmation.  However,  some  of 
the most active adjuvant breast cancer interventions, including 
aromatase  inhibitors   ( 21  –  24 )   and  trastuzumab   ( 33  –  35 ) ,  are 
effective only in biologically deﬁ ned subgroups, and interactions 
have been observed between ER status and adjuvant chemother-
apy effect  ( 36 ) . Thus, it would not be surprising to ﬁ nd that a 
lifestyle  intervention  has  an  effect  on  only  some  categories  of 
breast cancer. 

 Because ER-positive cancers are under estrogen inﬂ uence, a 
predominant inﬂ uence of diet on ER-negative cancers would im-
plicate factors other than estrogen  ( 37 , 38 )  as mediators. Other 
potential  mechanisms  include  reduced  insulin  levels   ( 39 , 40 ) , 
reduced  insulin  resistance   ( 41 ) ,  reduced  insulin-like  growth

factor 1  ( 42 , 43 ) , or reduced inﬂ ammation markers — all factors 
that may be inﬂ uenced by dietary fat decrease and/or weight loss 
 ( 44 , 45 ) . Planned analyses of serial fasting blood samples in the 
two groups will address these issues. 

 The most appropriate endpoint for breast cancer adjuvant tri-
als is controversial, and even the deﬁ nitions of these endpoints 
are  inconsistent   ( 46 ) .  Endpoints  from  recent  selected  adjuvant 
therapy trials are compared to the relapse-free survival endpoint 
of the WINS trial in  Table 6 . Collectively, these reports deﬁ ne 
the  endpoint  of   “ disease-free  survival ”   in  four  different  ways 
 ( 21  –  24 , 27 ) . We deﬁ ned relapse-free survival, the prospectively 
identiﬁ ed primary study endpoint in WINS, in the same way that 
Goss et al.  ( 22 )  recently deﬁ ned a disease-free survival endpoint. 

To facilitate comparison of our study with others, we included 
death without breast cancer recurrence and second primary can-
cers  as  events  in  additional  analyses;  all  results  led  to  similar 
conclusions  regarding  the  effects  of  the  dietary  intervention. 
Establishment of a common terminology for breast cancer adju-
vant trial endpoints should be a future priority of the research 
community.     

 This study has several potential limitations. One is the imbal-
ance  of  surgical  treatments  between  the  groups:  5.6%  more 
women in the control group than in the intervention group had 
breast-conserving  therapy. As  a  result,  55  more  women  in  the 
control group with  such surgery were at risk for an ipsilateral 
recurrence. However, considering all 1018 control group women 
with breast-conserving surgery, only 2.1% experienced ipsilat-
eral  recurrence.  Consequently,  only  about  one  additional  in-
breast  recurrence  would  be  anticipated  based  on  the  surgical 
distribution. Thus, the modest imbalance in surgical management 
is unlikely to explain the difference in clinical outcome that we 
observed.  In  addition,  in  a  large  National  Surgical  Adjuvant 
Breast  and  Bowel  Project  Cancer  randomized  trial  comparing 
mastectomy with lumpectomy plus radiation, women with mas-
tectomy had a similar rate of local and regional recurrences after 
approximately 5 years of follow-up, even when ipsilateral breast 
recurrences were included (45 such recurrences were seen in the 
mastectomy  group  compared  with  43  in  the  lumpectomy  plus 
 radiation group)  ( 47 ) . Moreover, our adjustment for surgery type 
(mastectomy versus lumpectomy) in the Cox proportional haz-
ards models should have controlled for the effect of the differ-
ences in surgical management. 

 A  second  limitation  of  the  study  is  its  reliance  on  self-
report of dietary intake because no validated  “ gold standard ”  
exists  for  assessing  dietary  fat  intake   ( 48 ) .  However,  body 
weight  was  statistically  signiﬁ cantly  lower  in  the  dietary 
group,  providing  biologic  plausibility  that  a  dietary  change 
did occur in women on the low-fat eating plan. Although the 
dietary intervention focused on reducing fat intake, intake of 
other nutrients changed, as did body weight. Thus, it is possi-
ble  that  weight  change   ( 49 , 50 )   and/or  dietary  factors  other 
than fat intake inﬂ uenced the breast cancer outcome. Planned 
future analyses will examine time trends and associations of 
changes in body weight and other dietary factors with breast 
cancer recurrence. 

 Study strengths include the randomized study design, closely 
comparable  anticancer  systemic  therapies  provided  to  women 
in  the  two  randomization  groups,  and  the  degree  of  dietary 
 adherence  achieved  by  study  participants.  The  reduction  in

 dietary fat intake seen in the WINS trial is similar to or greater 
than  that  reported  in  other  trials  evaluating  breast  cancer  and 
diet associations either for primary prevention  ( 31 , 51 )  or recur-
rence  ( 52 ) . 

 Replication in clinical practice of this dietary intervention will 
likely  require  on-going  counseling  with  a  dietician  trained  in 
these techniques. The WINS low-fat eating plan was intensive, 
individualized, and delivered using a standardized protocol by 
registered dieticians who had received centralized training which 
included motivational interviewing techniques. 

 In summary, an interim efﬁ cacy analysis suggests that a life-
style intervention reducing dietary fat intake with modest body 
weight loss may improve the relapse-free survival of postmeno-
pausal  breast  cancer  patients.  Ongoing  follow-up  will  address 
original protocol design plans calling for 3 years of follow-up 
after completion of recruitment.
