White button mushrooms are a widely consumed food contain-
ing phytochemicals beneﬁcial to cancer prevention. The purpose
of this research was to evaluate the effects of white button mush-
room extract and its major component, conjugated linoleic acid
(CLA) on prostate cancer cell lines in vitro and mushroom extract
in vivo. In all cell lines tested, mushroom inhibited cell prolifer-
ation in a dose-dependent manner and induced apoptosis within
72 h of treatment. CLA inhibited proliferation in the prostate can-
cer cell lines in vitro. DU145 and PC3 prostate tumor size and
tumor cell proliferation were decreased in nude mice treated with
mushroom extract, whereas tumor cell apoptosis was increased
compared to pair-fed controls. Microarray analysis of tumors iden-
tiﬁed signiﬁcant changes in gene expression in the mushroom-fed
mice as compared to controls. Gene network analysis identiﬁed
alterations in networks involved in cell death, growth and prolif-
eration, lipid metabolism, the TCA cycle and immune response.
The data provided by this study illustrate the anticancer potential
of phytochemicals in mushroom extract both in vitro and in vivo
and supports the recommendation of white button mushroom as
a dietary component that may aid in the prevention of prostate
cancer in men.

BACKGROUND

The majority of common dietary constituents do not have
an acute biological effect immediately after ingestion. How-
ever, when eaten daily over a lifetime, subtle, long-term effects
may be observed. For this reason, cancer of the prostate, which
requires many years to develop, is a prime target for preven-
tion strategies utilizing daily factors such as dietary intake. It
is estimated that the time required for the clonal outgrowth of
a prostate cancer cell to develop into a 1 cm3 primary prostate
cancer would be 39.4 yr, with the mean age at diagnosis occur-
ring at 72 yr of age (1). Epidemiologic studies have suggested

that changes in lifestyle, including dietary modiﬁcations, could
prevent a signiﬁcant number of cancers (2–4). Of the environ-
mental factors that affect prostate cancer development, diet has
been identiﬁed as an important inﬂuence (5,6). Therefore, incor-
porating foods into the diet that are known to have chemopreven-
tive properties could reduce cancer incidence and subsequently
cancer-related deaths.

Several mushroom species such as Ganoderma lucidum,
Lentinus edodes, Grifola frondosa and Agaricus blazei have
been shown to exhibit anticancer effects such as the inhibition of
cell proliferation in prostate (7,8), colon (9–11), and breast can-
cer cell lines (10,12). Mechanisms attributed to the anticancer
activity of mushrooms include the induction of apoptosis; the
inhibition of angiogenesis and prosurvival signaling pathways
such as protein kinase B (AKT), extracellular-regulated
kinase (ERK), nuclear factor kappa-B (NF6-B) and activating
protein-1 (AP-1) (7,13,14) and modulation of the cell cycle
control protein retinoblastoma (pRb) (8). Although much study
has been completed on the medicinal varieties of mushroom
mentioned above, studies into the anticancer effects of the com-
mon white button mushroom (Agaricus bisporus) are limited.
Much of the research has focused on the anticancer effects
of carbohydrate fractions of this species. For example, lectins
isolated from the white button mushroom have been shown to
increase the sensitivity of lung, colon, and glioblastoma cancer
cells to chemotherapeutic drugs (15), inhibit colon cancer cell
proliferation (16), and enhance cellular antioxidant defense
mechanisms (17).

Previous studies in our laboratory investigated the antiaro-
matase activity of common vegetables that may suppress breast
cancer cell proliferation. Of the 7 vegetable extracts tested, the
extract of white button mushrooms was the most effective in-
hibitor of human placental aromatase activity (18). Our labora-
tory has focused on an ethyl acetate extract of the white button
mushroom, which contains mainly C-18 fatty acids and simple
organic and phenolic acids (19). We have previously reported
that this extract effectively decreased the proliferation of breast
cancer cells through the inhibition of aromatase enzyme activity.

We also identiﬁed CLA as a major component of the mushroom
extract and also an active inhibitor of breast cancer cell prolif-
eration and aromatase activity (18,19).

To determine the anticancer potential of mushroom extract
in prostate cancer cell lines, the current study investigated the in
vitro effects of this extract on the androgen sensitive LNCaP and
androgen insensitive PC3 and DU145 prostate cancer cell lines.
We also studied the in vivo chemopreventive potential of mush-
room extract in two separate studies utilizing male athymic mice
injected with either DU145 or PC3 prostate cancer cell lines.
The information gained from this study gives us future direc-
tion for investigation into the active ingredients of mushrooms
as well as their mechanisms and to the overall understanding
of how inclusion of mushrooms into the diet may contribute to
more effective prostate cancer prevention strategies.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Cell Culture

LNCaP, PC3, and DU145 cell lines were obtained from
American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Rockville, MD) and
grown in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal bovine serum in the
presence of 100 U/ml penicillin and 0.1 g/l streptomycin. Cells
◦
C with 95% air and 5% carbon dioxide.
were incubated at 37
All cells were kept below passage 20 and used in experiments
during the linear phase of growth.

Production of Mushroom Extract

Mushroom extract was produced by chopping 60 g of fresh
white button mushroom (Agaricus bisporus) and boiling it in
water. The broth was ﬁltered and then applied to 5 g/60 ml
capacity polyamide columns (Discovery DPA-6S SPE; Supelco,
Bellefonte, PA). Fractions were eluted by a step gradient (50
ml of each step) of increasing methanol to water. The 20%
methanol–water fraction was rotor evaporated to dryness and
then redissolved in 1 ml of water to produce the 6× mushroom
extract. Therefore, 6 g of mushroom can produce 100 µl of 6 ×
fraction.

Real-Time Proliferation Assay

Cells were plated in 16 well plates at a density of 10,000 cells/
well and treated with either medium containing ethanol as ve-
hicle control (<0.1% total) or CLA (Cayman Chemical, Ann
Arbor, MI; 0–200 µM). Cell growth was monitored automat-
ically via the ACEA RT-CES real-time proliferation machine
(ACEA Biosciences, Inc., San Diego, CA), which swept the
plates once an hour for up to 96 h. The machine measures elec-
trical impedance through sensors on the bottom of the 16 well
plates. Increase in impedance correlates with an increase in cell
density. Media and treatments were changed after 48 h. Data are
expressed as ratio of treated to untreated cells mean ± SE for 3
replications.

Apoptosis ELISA

Apoptosis was assessed utilizing the Cell Death Detection
ELISAPLUS Assay (Boehringer Mannheim, Indianapolis, IN).
This assay is a photometric enzyme-linked immunoassay that
quantitatively measures the internucleosomal degradation of
DNA, which occurs during apoptosis. The assay is a quanti-
tative sandwich-enzyme-immunoassay utilizing monoclonal
mouse antibodies directed against DNA and histones that
detect speciﬁcally mononucleosomes and oligonucleosomes.
Quantitative measurement of the amount of internucleosomal
degradation is measured photometrically at 405 nm with ABTS
as substrate. Cells were plated in 60 mm dishes (Falcon, BD
Biosciences, San Jose, CA) at a density of 100,000 cells/dish
and allowed to attach for 24 h. Cells were treated with media
control (mushroom extract is water soluble) or mushroom
extract at a concentration of 20 µl/ml for 48 and 72 h. Following
treatments, nonadherent cells were collected and pelleted at
200 g for 10 min. The supernatant was discarded; the cell pellet
was washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 137
mmol/l sodium chloride, 1.5 mmol/l potassium phosphate, 7.2
mmol/l sodium phosphate, 2.7 mmol/l potassium chloride, pH
7.4) and recentrifuged. Adherent cells were washed with cold
PBS, trypsinized, collected, and combined with nonadherent
cells. Both live and dead cells were then counted via Trypan
Blue (Pierce, Rockford, IL) exclusion, and 10,000 cells were
added to the microtiter plate for all treatment groups; and
apoptosis assay was performed according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Absorbance was read on a SpectraMax M5
plate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) at 405 nm.
Background values were subtracted from readings (media plus
reagent, no cells) and expressed as absorbance of dye bound to
antibodies bound to mononucleosomes and oligonucleosomes
at 405 nm of each treated sample divided by media controls.

Annexin V Assay

Cells were plated in 100 mm dishes (Falcon, BD Biosciences,
San Jose, CA) at a density of 50,000 cells/dish and allowed to
attach for 72 h. Cells were treated with media control (mushroom
extract is water soluble) or mushroom extract at a concentration
of 20 µl/ml for 48 and 72 h. Following treatments, adherent
cells were trypsinized, nonadherent cells were collected, and
all cells were pelleted at 200 g for 10 min and then washed
twice with cold 1 × PBS and resuspended in 1 ml of 1 ×
binding buffer (10 mM HEPES/NaOH pH 7.4, 140 mM NaCl,
2.5 mM CaCl2) at a concentration of 1 × 106 cells/ml. 1 × 105
cells were stained with Annexin V-FITC; BD Pharmingen, San
Jose, CA) and propidium iodide (PI; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis,
MO) for 15 min at room temperature in the dark. After adding
400 ml of 1 × binding buffer to each tube, cells were analyzed
by ﬂow cytometry within 1 h on a CyAnTM ADP 9color-UV
ﬂow cytometer(Dako, Inc., Carpinteria, CA). Controls included
unstained cells, cells stained with Annexin V-FITC only, and
cells stained with PI only.

Animal Experiments

Five-week-old, male BALB/c Nu-Nu, athymic mice were
purchased (Charles River Laboratories). Mice were randomly
divided into 6 groups with 8 mice per group. At 6 wk of age,
mice were gavage fed with either 100 µl water control or 100 µl
mushroom extract (in water). The third group was gavaged with
100 µl water and pair fed to the 6X mushroom group (the
food consumed by the 6X mushroom group was weighed and
the same amount provided to the pair-fed group) to control
for differences in caloric intake. Each animal received daily
gavage treatment for the duration of the experiment. At 7 wk
of age, mice were given two subcutaneous injections of either
DU145 or PC3 cells in Matrigel (BD Biosciences, San Jose,
CA). These cells were grown in RPMI 1640 with nonessential
amino acids, sodium pyruvate, and Earle’s salts in 10% fetal calf
serum. The cells were harvested and resuspended in an equal
volume of Matrigel (BD Biosciences) to a ﬁnal concentration of
1 × 107 cells/0.2 ml. Body weights were monitored weekly as
an indicator of the animal’s overall health. At the end of 7 wk
of gavage treatment, mice were euthanized; blood samples were
collected; and tumors were removed, weighed, and sent for
hematoxilin and eosin (H & E) histological staining through
the City of Hope Pathology Department Core Facility. Tumor
specimens were also stained using cleaved-caspase-3 antibody
(Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA) for apoptosis and
Ki-67 antibody (Dakocytomation, Carpinteria, CA) staining for
cell proliferation by the City of Hope Pathology Department
Core Facility. Data are expressed as mean ± SEM (n ≥ 5).

Microarray Analysis

For microarray analysis, total RNA was extracted from 3
DU145-derived tumors from each treatment group using TRI-
zol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Synthesis and labeling
of cRNA targets, hybridization of GeneChips, and signal de-
tection were carried out by the Microarray Core Facility at the
City of Hope. Brieﬂy, biotinylated cRNA was generated using
5 µg total RNA using T7 RNA polymerase. The Affymetrix
GeneChip Human Genome U133A v2.0 array (HGU133A2)
(Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) was used to deﬁne gene expres-
sion proﬁles from tumor samples. For microarray hybridization,
the GeneChip arrays were hybridized with 15 µg of fragmented
cRNA targets and then washed. The staining was performed with
streptavidin-PE. Affymetrix GeneChip images were scanned at
11-µm resolution using a high resolution GeneChip Scanner
3000 (Hewlett-Packard).

Statistical Processing of Microarray Data

Quality assessment and statistical analysis of gene expression
data was performed using the R/Bioconductor packages. To en-
sure the high quality of the microarray process, a set of quality
assessment steps implemented in Bioconductor package “Affy-
Express” were applied to the data. Raw intensity measurements

of all probe sets were converted into expression measurements
using the “GCRMA” package. The “LIMMA” package was
then used to identify the genes differentially expressed between
mushroom-fed and water-fed samples. The genes showing al-
tered expression were categorized on the basis of their cellular
components, biological processes, molecular functions, and sig-
nal pathways using the Ingenuity Pathways Analysis (Ingenuity,
Mountain View, CA) software. Signiﬁcant genes were selected
with a cutoff of P < 0.01 and log2 ratio of 1 (twofold change).

Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA)

IPA is a Web-based software program that identiﬁes the bio-
logical functions, pathways, and mechanisms most relevant to a
given data set of genes. Information on individual genes is drawn
from a large knowledge base of biological networks created
from millions of publications (full-text articles published in sci-
entiﬁc journals), and the networks are drawn by the Functional
Analysis feature of IPA based on the connectivity of the genes.

RESULTS

Effects of Mushroom Extract on Prostate Cancer Cell
Proliferation

The antiproliferative activity of mushroom extract was as-
sessed in the LNCaP, DU145, and PC3 prostate cancer cell lines.
Cells were treated with mushroom extract (20 µl/ml) for 96 h.
Results from this assay showed that exposure to mushroom ex-
tract resulted in a signiﬁcant, dose-dependent inhibition of cell
proliferation (P ≤ 0.01) in all cell lines tested. The magnitude

of mushroom extract. Readings were taken every hour up to 96 h by the ACEA

represent means ± SE (n = 3); * indicates signiﬁcant difference from media

of response to mushroom extract was similar between cell lines
(Fig. 1).

Induction of Apoptosis by Mushroom Extract

To determine whether the observed decrease in cell num-
ber after treatment with mushroom extract was due to the in-
duction of apoptosis, the formation of mononucleosomes and
oligonucleosomes was quantiﬁed using the Cell Death Detection
ELISAPLUS assay (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany)
and Annexin V/PI staining. Following treatment with mushroom
extract (20µl/ml) for 48 h, a signiﬁcant twofold increase in DNA
fragmentation was detected in the LNCaP cells (P ≤ 0.01) com-
pared to untreated controls (Fig. 2A). The PC3 and DU145 cell

lines showed no increase in the production of mononucleosomes
and oligonucleosomes with mushroom treatment compared to
untreated controls at 48 h (Fig. 2A). However, after 72 h of
treatment, mushroom extract signiﬁcantly induced DNA frag-
mentation 4.4-fold in the PC3 cells (P ≤ 0.001) and 1.8-fold in
the DU145 cells (P ≤ 0.001; Fig. 2B).

The translocation of phosphatidylserine (PS) to the outer
leaﬂet of the plasma membrane was determined using Annexin
V-FITC/PI staining and ﬂow cytometry. Changes in the location
of cell surface markers, such as PS, are the earliest detectable
features of apoptotic cells. As such, PS detection in intact cells
(PI negative cells) represent an early stage of apoptosis in the
cell lines tested following exposure to mushroom extract. In
the LNCaP cells, Annexin V positive cells increased 4.4-fold
with mushroom treatment after 48 h compared to untreated
controls (P = 0.025). In PC3 cells treated with mushroom
extract, Annexin V staining increased threefold (P ≤ 0.01),
whereas the DU145 cells exhibited a 1.4-fold increase compared
to untreated controls (Fig. 3A). After 72 h of treatment with
mushroom extract, PC3 cells had a twofold increase in Annexin
V staining (P ≤ 0.02), whereas DU145 cells had a 1.6-fold
increase in Annexin V staining (P ≤ 0.02; Fig. 3B). These
results illustrate that the LNCaP cell line is more sensitive to
the proapoptotic effects of mushroom extract compared to the

was not statistically signiﬁcant (Fig. 5B). Histological exam-
ination of the PC3 tumors showed that cell proliferation was
signiﬁcantly decreased 45% in the mushroom group compared
to controls (P ≤ 0.01; Fig. 4C), and the level of apoptosis in-
creased 200% (P ≤ 0.001; Fig. 5C). The LNCaP cell line did
not reliably form tumors when implanted into the athymic mice,
therefore we chose not to utilize that cell line for this study. The
DU145 and PC3 data illustrates the ability of mushroom extract
to decrease the growth and induce apoptosis of prostate cancer
cells in vivo.

In addition, the DU145 cell line showed only a mild response to
mushroom extract and is therefore more resistant than the other
two cell lines. Additionally, this shows that the antiproliferative
activity is distinct from the proapoptotic activity of mushroom,
as all three cell lines responded equally in the proliferation
assay.

Inhibition of Tumor Growth In Vivo

To evaluate the prostate cancer protective effects of white
button mushroom in vivo, our laboratory investigated the ability
of mushroom extract to inhibit PC3 and DU145-derived tu-
mor growth in male, athymic (nu/nu) mice. The results of these
animal experiments showed that the oral intake of mushroom
extract signiﬁcantly decreased DU145 tumor weight 44.5%
(P ≤ 0.05) (Fig. 4A) and PC3 tumor weight 68.6% (P ≤
0.01; Fig. 5A) compared to pair-fed control mice. There was no
difference in mouse weight between treatment groups. Histolog-
ical examination of DU145 tumors revealed that cell prolifera-
tion was signiﬁcantly decreased 25.3% in the mushroom group
compared to controls (P ≤ 0.05; Fig. 4B), whereas the level
of apoptosis between tumors from the control and mushroom
extract-fed animals was increased, although this observation

Through GC analysis, we previously identiﬁed conjugated
linoleic acid isomer 9Z, 11E as a major component in the 6X
mushroom fraction (an average of 45.7% of the total extract).
We also showed that 9Z, 11E CLA alone inhibits breast cancer
cell proliferation through inhibition of the activity of the aro-
matase enzyme (19). Therefore, we tested the ability of the two
common isoforms of CLA (9Z, 11E and 10E, 12Z) to inhibit
prostate cancer cell proliferation. The results indicate that both
isoforms of CLA signiﬁcantly inhibited prostate cancer cell pro-
liferation in a dose dependent manner (9Z, 11E with a P value
≤0.01 and 10E, 12Z with a P value ≤0.05; Figs. 6A–6F), sug-
gesting that CLA may be one of the major active components
in mushroom extract. However, in natural products, it is gener-
ally accepted that the overall combination of components can
be more potent than any one component singled out. Further, it
is possible that one of the minor components could be as active
as CLA; however, in our breast cancer studies, the ethyl acetate
fraction was the most potent fraction, and the major constituent
was found to be CLA.

Validation of Microarray Results by Real-Time PCR

Microarray analysis results were validated by real-time PCR
using primers for three of the most highly regulated and in-
teresting genes (KIT, FAS, and FH) in tumor samples. Results
showed a signiﬁcant decrease in KIT expression and signiﬁ-
cant increases in the expression of FAS and FH (Figs. 7A–7C),
which is in agreement with the microarray analysis results.

Network Analysis of Mushroom Responsive Genes

Genes that were regulated by mushroom extract in DU-145
tumor samples were analyzed for their functional grouping us-
ing IPA. Six networks of genes were signiﬁcantly altered by
mushroom extract identiﬁed by IPA in our data set (Table 1). Of
these networks, 2 were of prime interest to this investigation:
those grouping genes important to cell death, cellular growth
and proliferation, and cellular morphology and those group-
ing genes important to cellular growth and proliferation, lipid
metabolism, and small molecule biochemistry. An illustration
of these gene networks can be found as supplemental Data 1
and 2, respectively.

control or 100 µl mushroom extract (in water). Each animal received daily gavage treatment for 7 wk. After 1 wk of gavaging, mice were given 2 subcutaneous
injections of DU145 cells in Matrigel (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). 6 wk after injection, mice were euthanized and A: tumor weights, B: Ki-67 antibody
staining for cell proliferation, and C: cleaved-caspase-3 antibody for apoptosis were evaluated. Data represent mean in each group (n ≥ 5 ± standard error of the
mean). * indicates statistical signiﬁcance from control group (P ≤ 0.05).

Within the gene networks, speciﬁc biological functions such
as apoptosis, lipid metabolism, and immune response were al-
tered by mushroom extract. These groupings suggest possible
mechanisms of action for the effects of mushroom extract ob-
served in the prostate tumors. Table 2 shows the gene symbol,
Entrez Gene number, fold change from controls, and description
of these gene groupings.

DISCUSSION

The aim of this research was to test the anticancer activity
of phytochemicals in the common white button mushroom
(Agaricus bisporus) in prostate cancer in vitro and in vivo.
Our results show that mushroom extract decreased the prolif-
eration of the prostate cancer cell lines in a dose-dependent
manner compared to untreated control cells. It is important to
note that mushroom extract had a similar antiproliferative effect
on all three cell lines despite their differing status with regard

to androgen responsiveness. Therefore, we can conclude that
the antiproliferative action of mushroom extract is mediated
through an androgen-independent mechanism.

As seen in Figs. 2 and 3, differing levels of sensitivity to
apoptosis induced by mushroom extract exist between the three
cell lines, with the LNCaP being the most sensitive, the PC3 less
sensitive, and the DU145 the least responsive to the proapoptotic
effects of mushroom extract. A similar result was seen in a study
utilizing an extract of Phellinus linteus (PL) mushroom in which
LNCaP cells underwent apoptosis to a larger degree than PC3
cells after treatment with PL. This study showed that caspase 2
expression was upregulated in LNCaP cells but not PC3 cells,
and inhibition of caspase 2 abolished the proapoptotic effect of
PL in LNCaP cells. The proapoptotic proteins caspase 8, caspase
3, and BID were activated equally in both LNCaP and PC3 cells
(20), suggesting that although apoptosis may be induced along
similar pathways in DU-45, PC3, and LNCaP prostate cancer
cell lines, the modulation of additional pathways in androgen

FIG. 5.
In vivo effect of mushroom extract on PC3 prostate tumor growth. 6-wk–old, athymic, nude male mice were gavage fed with either 100 µl water control
or 100 µl mushroom extract (in water). Each animal received daily gavage treatment for 7 wk. After 1 wk of gavaging, mice were given 2 subcutaneous injections
of PC3 cells in Matrigel (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). 6 wk after injection, mice were euthanized and A: tumor weights, B: Ki-67 antibody staining for cell
proliferation, and C: cleaved-caspase-3 antibody for apoptosis were evaluated. Data represent mean in each group (n ≥ 5 ± standard error of the mean). * indicates

responsive, LNCaP cells may sensitize them further and make
them more susceptible to apoptosis. Future studies will be done
to determine the mechanisms behind the differing response from
each cell line.

Our in vivo studies illustrated that oral intake of mushroom
extract suppresses the growth of androgen-independent prostate
tumors in mice. This shows that the phytochemicals present in
mushroom are active after oral ingestion. Further, the suppres-
sion of growth was due to inhibition of cell proliferation as mea-
sured by Ki-67 antibody staining, and induction of apoptosis was
observed. This result is in agreement with the in vitro results.
Our previous study (19) did not show apoptosis as a mechanism
of mushroom extract in breast cancer cells lines and tumors,
whereas in the current study in prostate cancer, apoptosis was
observed in the prostate cell lines. It is well known that distinct
cell lines within the same cancer family can respond differently
to treatment (as was seen in the current study); therefore, it is

reasonable to expect that results in two different cancer types
could also be dissimilar.

Results from microarray analysis suggest several mecha-
nisms for the effect of mushroom on prostate cancer cell prolif-
eration and apoptosis. Although the expression of many genes
was affected, two genes of primary interest are FAS/APO-1
and KIT. FAS/APO-1 is a member of the tumor necrosis fac-
tor receptor superfamily. This receptor contains a death do-
main and plays a central role in the physiological regulation of
programmed cell death (apoptosis). This gene was upregulated
2.84-fold in tumors from the mushroom group compared to pair-
fed controls (P = 0.035). KIT encodes the human homolog of
the proto-oncogene c-kit, and the protein product plays a role
in the proliferation and survival of the cell. KIT gene expres-
sion was downregulated fourfold in tumors from the mushroom
group compared to pair-fed controls (P = 0.043). These results
suggest that mushroom extract may have a favorable effect on

FIG. 6. CLA inhibits proliferation of prostate cancer cell lines. Cells were plated in the ACEA 16-well plate (5,000 cells/well) in media alone or treated with
indicated concentrations of CLA; A: LNCaP, 9Z, 11E CLA; B: LNCaP, 10E, 12Z CLA; C: DU145 9Z, 11E CLA; D: DU145, 10E, 12Z CLA; E: PC3, 9Z, 11E

the proliferation and survival of prostate cancer cells in vivo
through increased expression of FAS and decreased expression
of KIT.

Microarray analysis results also indicate that the net effect of
mushroom extract on lipid metabolism in tumor tissues could
result in a decrease of diacylglycerol (DAG) and prostaglandin
E2 (PGE2) production/release while increasing ceramide and
arachidonic acid release. Both ceramide and arachidonic acid are
involved in proapoptotic signaling (21–23) in cancer cells. DAG
production leads to the activation of PKC and the subsequent in-
hibition of ceramide-mediated apoptosis (24). Therefore, mush-
room could also increase apoptosis through increased produc-
tion of arachidonic acid (an eicosanoid) and ceramide, which
is facilitated by inhibition of DAG production. Additionally, a

study by Ochoa et al. (25) found that the 9Z, 11E isomer of CLA,
which was found to be prominent in mushroom extract, had
signiﬁcant effects on cell proliferation and apoptosis through
modulation of eicosanoid biosynthesis in PC3 prostate cancer
cells. Speciﬁcally, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) protein expres-
sion and 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) mRNA expression were both
decreased in cells treated with 9Z, 11E CLA, suggesting that
modulation of eicosanoid biosynthesis may be one mechanism
by which CLA inhibits prostate cell proliferation (25). This data
is in agreement with the observed effects in the current study of
CLA-rich mushroom extract in prostate cancer cells.

Arachidonic acid is converted to PGE2 through the (COX-
2) pathway, and PGE2 production is commonly increased
in tumor tissues. PGE2 itself has been shown to promote

downregulated threefold (P = 0.017), whereas FH expression
was upregulated 4.3-fold (P = 0.009) in the mushroom-treated
group compared to pair-fed controls. This is of interest due to
the unique nature of normal prostate epithelial cells to secrete
citrate rather than utilize it in the TCA cycle for the produc-
tion of ATP. Prostate cancer cells, however, alter this balance
by upregulating the citric acid cycle to produce more energy
through increased ATP production (27). Therefore, mushroom
extract may normalize the TCA cycle in prostate cancer cells by
downregulation of isocitrate dehydrogenase expression. Citrate
is converted to acetyl co-A, which is an instrumental compo-
nent in fatty acid synthesis, leading back to the above-mentioned
effects of mushroom treatment on this process.

With regard to FH, the expression of this enzyme was upreg-
ulated in mushroom-treated mice, showing that the citric acid
cycle is not entirely inhibited; and therefore, fumarate is still
produced and in need of conversion to malate. Fumarate has
been shown to activate the angiogenic factor HIF1α, therefore
augmenting the cancer’s ability to sustain and spread through
increasing its blood supply (27). Upregulation of FH expres-
sion by mushrooms would inhibit fumarate buildup in the cell
and downregulate the angiogenic response. Additionally, en-
dothelin 1, which is a gene that is commonly upregulated in
hypoxia (28), was downregulated threefold in tumor specimens
from mushroom-treated mice. Therefore, through analysis of
the microarray data, we can further hypothesize that mush-
room decreased tumor size, tumor cell proliferation, and in-
creased tumor cell apoptosis through its effects on the TCA
cycle and fatty acid metabolism. Future studies will address this
hypothesis.

Several studies have demonstrated that several mushroom
species can enhance immunity through activation of natural
killer (NK) cells (29) and modulation of lymphocyte number and
activity (30). Studies have also shown that mushroom treatment
can induce both Type 1 and Type 2 immune response (31).
Evasion of the immune response is one way in which tumor cells
survive; therefore, the effect of mushroom on the expression of
genes important to immune function, such as was seen in the
microarray analysis (Table 2), is another mechanism that could
contribute to its anticancer action in vivo.

Identiﬁcation of the phytochemicals present in mushroom
extract is important to understanding its mode of action and
could facilitate future studies by enabling the use of puriﬁed
compounds from the extract. Similar to our previous ﬁnd-
ings in breast cancer, the current study showed that CLA in-
hibited the proliferation of prostate cancer cell lines. Much
research has been published illustrating the antiproliferative
(25,32,33) and proapoptotic (34–36) activity of CLA. CLA
has also been shown to have signiﬁcant effects on the immune
system such as increased T-cell responsiveness and splenocyte
IL-2 production in mice fed 1% CLA in the diet (37). Thus,
the presence of this compound in white button mushrooms
likely signiﬁcantly adds to the biological activity of the whole
extract.

FIG. 7. Relative expression levels of c-KIT, FAS, and FH in tumor sam-
ples. mRNA expression of A: c-Kit, B: FAS, and C: FH in tumor samples
was determined by quantitative, real-time PCR, and the expression of β-actin

cancer progression by increasing angiogenesis through vas-
cular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) activation, blocking
apoptosis through activation of the phosphatidylinositor 3-
kinase (PI3K)/AKT/peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor
(PPAR) signaling pathway, increasing tumor cell proliferation
through activation of the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK signaling path-
way and affecting immune suppression by increasing inter-
leukin 10 (IL10) production (23,26). Therefore, the suppression
of PGE2 is one way in which mushroom extract may inhibit
prostate tumor cell growth in vivo.

These effects on lipid metabolism are complimented by the
inhibition of isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (IDH2) and increased
expression of FH, 2 key tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle pro-
teins, which have also been shown to play a role in fatty
acid metabolism and tumor angiogenesis. IDH2 expression was

Taken together with research from other laboratories, our
results support the recommendation of white button mush-
room as a dietary component that may aid in the prevention
of prostate cancer in men. The in vivo studies demonstrate

that oral intake of the extract is effective in the inhibition of
prostate tumor growth in mice. Importantly, the dosage used
in the in vivo studies is considered physiologic, as the com-
mon conversion factor from murine to human dosage is 25,

calculated on body surface area (38). In addition to the in-
clusion of whole mushrooms into the diet, our work with the
extract and isolation of CLA from the extract suggests that
puriﬁed compounds or mixtures of compounds from mush-
room may have efﬁcacy as potential dietary supplements. Fu-
ture study into the mechanisms of action of mushroom extract
will help us to further delineate possible roles of mushroom
phytochemicals in the prevention and treatment of prostate
cancer.
