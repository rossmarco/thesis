Background: Fruit and vegetable intake has been associated with lower risk for cardiovascular diseases, but
data on congestive heart failure (CHF) are inconsistent. The association of serum carotenoids, biomarkers
reﬂecting fruit and vegetable intake, with the risk of CHF has not been well documented in previous studies.
We therefore examined the association between carotenoid levels and the risk of CHF.
Methods: Data were available for 1031 males aged 46 to 65 years participating in the Kuopio Ischaemic Heart
Disease Risk Factor Study (Finland). Baseline data for the present study were collected between 1991 and
1993. The association between serum concentrations of carotenoids and the risk of CHF was examined by
using Cox proportional hazard models.
Results: During the median of 17.8 follow-up years, CHF occurred in 72 patients. Age and examination year
adjusted risk (hazard ratio, HR) for CHF among men within the lowest quartile of serum β-carotene was
4.08 (95% CI, 1.90–8.78, p b0.001) as compared to men in the highest quartile of serum β-carotene. After further
adjustment for many potential confounders, men with the lowest quartile of β-carotene had almost 3-fold in-
creased risk of CHF (HR=2.78, 95% CI, 1.23–6.25, p=0.014). However, serum concentrations of lycopene and
α-carotene were not related to the risk of CHF.
Conclusions: The present study suggests that low concentrations of serum β-carotene may be associated with an
increased risk of CHF.

1. Introduction

Congestive heart failure (CHF) is a leading cause of cardiovascular
mortality and morbidity in the Western world [1] that affects over 15
million patients in Europe [2]. There is emerging evidence that oxida-
tive stress and inﬂammation are involved in the pathophysiology of
CHF [3], but the role of serum carotenoids, and the risk of heart failure
is not well known. The incidence and prevalence of CHF increases
with age and is estimated to rise in the next decade due to increasing
average age of the population [4,5]. The prognosis of advanced CHF is
poor in the elderly population [2]. Major causes of CHF are hypertension
and coronary heart disease (CHD) [6]. Other identiﬁed risk factors for
CHF include left ventricular hypertrophy, valvular heart disease, diabetes
mellitus, smoking, obesity and dyslipidemia [6].

Some previous case-control studies have shown a relationship
between antioxidant levels and the severity of CHF [7,8]. It may be

possible that antioxidants, such as β-carotene that eliminate free rad-
icals, are important factors reducing oxidative stress and inﬂammation
[7,9]. However, there is only one previous population-based study that
has shown low serum levels of β-carotene predicting a higher risk of
heart failure (HF) independently of risk factors [3]. The aim of the present
study was to examine whether carotenoids are associated with the risk
of CHF in Finnish men. This study cohort has been followed prospectively
for >17 years to ascertain the incidence of CHF.

2. Methods

2.1. Study population

The analyses were carried out among the participants of the Kuopio Ischaemic Heart
Disease Risk Factor (KIHD) Study, a longitudinal population based study designed to in-
vestigate risk factors for cardiovascular disease, atherosclerosis and related outcomes
[10]. The study population is a representative sample of men living in the city of Kuopio
and its surrounding rural communities, who were 46 to 65 years of age at baseline. The
baseline examinations of the present study were performed between 1991 and 1993. Of
1229 potentially eligible men, 1038 (83%) volunteered to participate at baseline examina-
tions, 107 declined to participate, and 52 were not able because of illness, relocation or
death. There were 473 subjects who had arterial hypertension and 191 subjects ischemic
heart disease at the baseline. Participants without history of CHF at the baseline examina-
tion were eligible for the present study, whereas men with history of CHF during the study
recruitment period were excluded. Women were not included in this cohort, because the

1842

follow-up study was based on men who were previously studied. Thus, complete data on
concentrations of carotenoids was available for 1031 men. The study protocol conforms to
the ethical guidelines of the 1975 Declaration of Helsinki as reﬂected in a priori approval
by the institution's human research committee. The KIHD study was approved by the
Research Ethics Committee of the University of Kuopio, and each participant gave written
informed consent. The authors of this manuscript have certiﬁed that they comply with the
Principles of Ethical Publishing in the International Journal of Cardiology.

2.2. Biochemical analyses

2.2.1. Blood sampling

Blood specimens were collected in Terumo Venoject vacuum tubes (10 mL) (Terumo,
Tokyo) from the antecubital vein without tourniquet after an overnight fast. Subjects had
rested in a supine position for 30 min before blood sampling. Subjects were instructed to
abstain from consuming alcohol for three days and from smoking for 12 h before blood
collection. Serum for carotenoids and other biochemical measurements were frozen
immediately after separation at −80 °C.

2.2.2. Measurement of carotenoids

Lycopene, α-carotene and β-carotene serum concentrations were measured from
frozen serum that had been stored at −80 °C for 4–36 months by using a modiﬁcation
of the high-performance liquid chromatographic method of Thurnham et al. [11]. Brieﬂy,
200 μL of serum was extracted with 5 mL of hexane and 1 mL of ethanol. The hexane layer
was separated and evaporated to dryness under nitrogen at room temperature and the
residue was dissolved in 200 μL of the mobile phase (acetonitrile-methanol-chloroform
47:47:6, v/v/v). Samples were injected in a C18 analytical column at room temperature.
Peaks were detected at wavelengths of 470 nm for lycopene, at 454 nm for other carotenoids
by a diode array detector (Model 168; Beckman Instruments, San Ramon, CA, USA). The
limits of detection for carotenoids were 0.03–0.07 μmol/L. Values below the limit of detection
of the assay were marked as 0.00 in the statistical analysis. The inter-assay coefﬁcients of
variation (CV) varied from 11.0 to 16.2% [12].

2.2.3. Other biochemical measurements

Concentrations of serum LDL (low-density lipoprotein) cholesterol and triglycerides
were analyzed with enzymatic methods (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc, Vantaa, Finland).
Serum HDL (high-density lipoprotein) cholesterol was measured after magnesium chlo-
ride dextran sulfate precipitation from the supernatant with enzymatic method (Thermo
Fisher Scientiﬁc). Serum high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) was measured by
the chemiluminescence-immunoassay method using Immulite 2000 analyzer (DPC, Los
Angeles, USA). Samples for measuring plasma concentrations of natriuretic propeptides
were collected into tubes at room temperature and then frozen. NT-proBNP was deter-
mined with radioimmunoassay utilizing antisera directed to NT-proBNP10–29, as described
in detail previously [13].

2.3. Other measurements

Resting blood pressure was measured in the morning by two trained nurses with a
random-zero mercury sphygmomanometer (Hawksley, Lancing, United Kingdom).
Blood pressure at rest was measured by a nurse with a random 0 mercury sphygmo-
manometer (Hawksley, United Kingdom; from 8:00 to 10:00 a.m). The measuring
protocol included, after a supine rest of 5 min, 3 measurements in the supine position, 1
measurement in the standing position, and 2 measurements in the sitting position at
5-minute intervals. The mean of 6 systolic and diastolic pressures was used in these analyses
[14]. Presence of hypertension was deﬁned as systolic blood pressure >165 mmHg and/or
diastolic blood pressure >95 mmHg with current use of antihypertensive medication.
Diabetes mellitus was deﬁned as a fasting blood glucose level ≥6.7 mmol/L or as a clinical
diagnosis of diabetes with dietary, oral or insulin treatment. Body mass index (BMI) was
computed as the ratio of weight (kilograms) to the square of height (meters). Alcohol con-
sumption was assessed with a structured quantity-frequency method on drinking behaviour
over the previous 12 months. Information on chronic diseases was checked during a medical
examination by the internist. Data on education, current medications and smoking status
were collected with a self-administered questionnaire and checked by the interviewer.
Education was coded into three categories based on years of education (b6, 7–11, and
12 or more years). Subjects were grouped, based on educational levels high school or
less, high school and college or post graduate [15]. Physical activity was assessed by
using a 12-month leisure-time history based on self-reported information on frequency
per month over the preceding year, average duration per occasion, and intensity level. A
subject was deﬁned a smoker if he had ever smoked on a regular basis and had smoked
cigarettes, cigars, or a pipe within the past 30 days. The lifelong exposure to smoking
was estimated as the product of the number of smoking years and the number of tobacco
products smoked daily at the time of examination.

2.4. Ascertainment of follow-up events

Every resident of Finland has a unique personal identiﬁer that is used in registers. There
were no losses to follow-up. Incidence of CHF cases that occurred between March 1991 and
December 2010 were included in the study. The diagnostic classiﬁcation of CHF cases were
coded according to the International Classiﬁcation of Disease ICD 9 (428) and ICD10 (I50)
codes.

The sources of information on heart failure (HF) were based on interviews, hospital
documents, death certiﬁcates, autopsy reports and medico-legal reports (ICD codes).
The classiﬁcation of HF was based on a previous history of heart disease, physical exami-
nation by a doctor, laboratory investigations including the determination of NT-proBNP,
echocardiography as well as electrocardiographic ﬁndings. Diastolic dysfunction was de-
ﬁned by using multiple echocardiographic parameters including mitral inﬂow velocity
patterns, pulmonary vein ﬂow patterns, the ratio between early (E) and late (atrial-A)
ventricular ﬁlling velocity (E:A reversal), tissue Doppler measurements, and M-mode
echo measurements (i.e. of left atrial size) with the use of an elevated NT-proBNP level
in the presence of normal ejection fraction.

2.5. Statistical analysis

Continuous variables were presented as means (standard deviations in parentheses)
and categorical variables as percentages. Normal distributions of carotenoids were tested
by Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Means of the continuous variables were compared using the
ANOVA and χ2 tests were used for categorical variables. Tests of linear trend were
conducted by assigning the median values for each category of exposure variable and
treating those as a single continuous variable. Subjects were classiﬁed into quartiles
according to their serum concentrations of carotenoids. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% con-
ﬁdence intervals (CIs) for CHF in quartiles of serum concentrations of carotenoids were
estimated by using Cox proportional hazard's models. Covariates were selected on the
basis of their previously established role as a predictive factor on the basis of overall evi-
dence and available data [3]. Thus, risk factors or covariates were chosen based on their
clinical relevance. Three different sets of covariates were used: 1) age and examination
year; 2) Model 1+BMI, years of education, smoking (yes vs. no), alcohol consumption,
physical activity, serum hs-CRP and serum LDL cholesterol; 3) Model 2+diabetes, arterial
hypertension with the use of antihypertensive medication (none vs. any β-blockers, ACE
inhibitors or angiotensin II antagonists and any calcium channel blockers or other), HF at
baseline examination and prevalent CHD. Kaplan-Meier curves were constructed using
the date of the baseline measure of carotenoids until CHF or censoring. Comparison of
the groups deﬁned by the carotenoid levels was assessed by the log-rank test. Tests for
statistical signiﬁcance were two sided and differences with pb0.05 were considered

3. Results

3.1. Baseline characteristics

Baseline characteristics in men with or without CHF during the
follow-up are shown in Table 1. The mean age of the subjects was
56.2 years (range 46.4–65.4 years). Subjects with CHF were older,
less educated, had higher systolic blood pressure, plasma NT-pro
BNP levels, BMI, lower levels of serum lycopene, β-carotene and HDL
cholesterol, and used more drugs for hypertension than CHF free sub-
jects. They were more likely to have prevalent CHD, diabetes and HF
at baseline examination. Table 2 shows the baseline characteristics of
the subjects categorized by quartiles of serum β-carotene. BMI, systolic
blood pressure, smoking, alcohol consumption, drugs for hypertension,
prevalence of hypertension, CHD, concentrations of serum lycopene,
α-carotene, LDL cholesterol, trigcerides and high sensitivity CRP differed
signiﬁcantly between the subjects in different quartiles of β-carotene
concentration.

Serum lycopene concentrations correlated inversely with age
(r=−0.30, pb0.001). However, serum α- and β-carotene concentra-
tions correlated positively with age (r=0.075, p=0.016 and r=0.072,
p=0.012). Carotenoids correlated inversely with arterial hypertension
(p b0.001) and in the lowest quartile of carotenoid levels including
β-carotene, the proportion of hypertensive patients was highest
(p b0.001) (data not shown).

3.2. Numbers of outcome events during follow-up

The median follow-up time from baseline to CHF, or the end of fol-
low up was 17.8 years (range 0.10–19.8 years, 18352 person-years).
There were identiﬁed 72 CHF patients in the cohort during follow-up

period. Log-rank test described the survival curves of patients whether
quartiles of plasma β-carotene concentrations affect the risk of CHF.
Kaplan–Meier analysis showed that the risk of CHF was signiﬁcantly
higher in subjects with the lowest quartile of β-carotene (log-rank,
p = 0.014) as compared with the highest quartile (Fig. 1).

3.3. Strongest risk predictors for congestive heart failure

In the multivariable or univariate model, the strongest statistically
signiﬁcant risk factors for CHF were age (HR=1.14), AF (HR=3.66),
diabetes (HR=4.33), HF at baseline examination (HR=3.08), preva-
lent CHD (HR=3.15), use of antihypertensive drugs (HR=3.09), arte-
rial hypertension with the use of antihypertensive drugs (HR=2.47)
and serum triglycerides (HR=1.29) after adjustment for age and exam-
ination year. Serum HDL cholesterol seems to be a strong protective fac-
tor against CHF (HR=0.14) (Table 3).

3.4. Concentrations of carotenoids and risk of congestive heart failure

Trend was linear across the quartiles of β-carotene (p=0.004) and
CHF cases. Age and examination year adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of
CHF among men within the lowest quartile of serum β-carotene was
4.08 (95% CI: 1.90–8.78, p b0.001) (Model 1). After further adjusting
for potential confounders in Model 2, including BMI, years of education,
smoking, alcohol consumption, physical activity, serum hs-CRP and
serum LDL cholesterol, men with the lowest quartile of β-carotene had
a 3-fold increased risk of CHF (HR=3.20; 95% CI: 1.43–7.15, p=0.005).
Results slightly changed, when diabetes, hypertension with the current
use of antihypertensive medication, HF at baseline examination and
prevalent CHD were included in Model 3 (HR=2.78; 95% CI: 1.23–6.25,
p=0.014) (Table 4). With serum β-carotene treated as continuous
variables, the adjusted HR was 0.12 (95% CI: 0.24–0.60, p=0.010) for
the risk of CHF. Moreover, low levels of β-carotene increased the risk
of CHD death (HR=2.13, 95% CI: 1.11–4.11, p=0.024).

The subjects with CHF during the follow-up were different in almost
all baseline characteristics from those without baseline HF. In our study,
subjects with CHF during the follow-up had more arterial hypertension
and CHD than other men at the baseline. Men with new CHF episode
used more drugs for hypertension, had a higher BMI and the prevalence
of diabetes. Hypertension and CHD are major risk factors for the inci-
dence and progression of HF [16]. These two risk factors frequently
coexist, and have synergistic effects that may promote both left ventric-
ular remodeling and the progression of HF in the general population.
The prevention of hypertension and coronary artery disease is impor-
tant for preventing HF [16]. In the present study, subjects with the
highest level of blood pressure were more common in the lowest quar-
tile of β-carotene levels and, on the other hand, the lowest levels of
β-carotene increased the risk of CHD death, which may explain ﬁndings
for the risk of CHF. Large population studies have shown that CHF is
approximately 4-fold more prevalent in diabetics than non-diabetics
and pre-diabetic disorders are associated with an intermediate preva-
lence [17,18].

There is only one previous cohort study showing that serum
β-carotene decreased the risk of HF in middle-aged men [3]. However,
some prior case-control studies have examined the relationship be-
tween carotenoid concentrations and CHF [7,8]. Mean plasma concen-
trations of retinol, α-tocopherol, lutein and lycopene were observed
to be signiﬁcantly lower in patients with severe CHF (the New York
Heart Association, NYHA class III) as compared to patients with moder-
ate CHF (NYHA class II) [8]. In another clinical study, concentrations of
plasma β-carotene were not different between HF patients and con-
trols, but concentrations tended to decrease in patients with HF [7].

It is suggested that oxidative stress and inﬂammation are involved
in the pathophysiology of HF. Some case-control studies have ob-
served a relationship between antioxidant levels and the severity of
HF [7,8]. Experimental studies have shown that antioxidants, such
as β-carotene, may lower the levels of free radicals [19], which are
important mediators of oxidative stress and inﬂammation. Several
studies have shown that patients with HF have increased levels of
serum of inﬂammatory cytokines [20,21]. Data suggest that carotenoids
also exhibit anti-inﬂammatory activity through induction of programmed
cell death in activated immune cells [22,23]. Previous studies have
shown that inﬂammation could be important in the development of
HF, and found a relationship between various inﬂammatory markers
and HF [9,24,25]. However, in our study, inﬂammation (hs-CRP) was
not a predictive risk factor for CHF. A previous report from The Uppsala
Longitudinal Study of Adult Men (ULSAM) cohort has shown that con-
centrations of serum β-carotene predict left ventricular diastolic func-
tion during the 20 year follow-up period [26].

It has been shown a decreasing trend (40% reduction) in death at-
tributed to HF over the past two decades in Europe including Finland
[27]. The changes in the Finnish diet and lifestyle, due to changes in
culture over the past 20 years, may have affected decreased incidence
of HF. On the basis of lycopene levels, we observed that older men
consume less tomatoes and tomato-based products than younger men,
respectively. However, the consumption of fruits and vegetables rich in
α- and β-carotene has increased over the years, as serum levels of
α-carotene and β-carotene were directly related to age in our study.
This may conversely explain the results of the present study. The diet
in Finland has changed greatly since the early 1970s until these days
[28]. Nowadays Finnish Health and Nutrition organization recommends
minimum 400 g of vegetables a day [29]. According to the previous ﬁnd-
ings from this study [30], it is apparent that Finnish men do not achieve
that recommendation as it was reported that the daily intake of fruits,
berries and vegetables was below 300 g/day in middle-aged men.

Strengths of the present study are the use of serum carotenoid
concentrations instead of dietary intakes for estimating the impact
of these carotenoids on CHF. Serum concentration of carotenoids is
a good direct marker for the intake and bioavailability of carotenoids
from fruits and vegetables, whereas the assessment of dietary

concentrations. Log-rank (Mantel–Cox) χ2=10.684, p=0.014.

Concentrations of lycopene and α-carotene were not associated
with the risk of CHF after adjustment for age, examination year
and other confounders, although the trend was linear for lycopene
(p = 0.001). However, low levels of lycopene (HR = 2.23, 95% CI:
1.12–4.46, p = 0.023) increased the risk of CHD death.

4. Discussion

The main result of our population-based study was that low serum
concentrations of β-carotene were associated with an increased risk of
CHF in middle-aged men. The low serum concentration of β-carotene
may indicate poor diet and lifestyle habits, which could increase the
risk of CHF regardless of the possible antioxidant activity of β-carotene.

questionnaires may cause variation due to their completeness for
inclusion of carotenoid-containing foods and may affect bias by
misclassiﬁcation [31]. Other strengths of the study are its population-
based recruitment, prospectively collected data, and extensive exami-
nations of potential risk factors. There were also no losses during
follow-up.

There are also some limitations in this study. A major limitation of
this study is the single measurement of β-carotene which can change
or ﬂuctuate over time and to predict an outcome within the next
20 years of follow up. The observed values of β-carotene are reliable
representatives of actual values over time. Serum concentrations of
β-carotene demonstrate short-term dietary intake, because the half-life
of β-carotene in blood circulation is shown to be approximately one
month [32]. Multiple-time point measurements would have resulted in
a more precise estimate. The limitation was that only men could be in-
cluded in our study. The follow-up study may be biased as the subjects
may have received advices about their lifestyle changes and medications,
which included the limitation of population-based follow-up study.
There is no information whether patients developed ﬁrstly clinically
manifest ischemic heart disease that eventually could lead to HF. We
evaluated the effect of carotenoids on hospitalization diagnosed CHF, al-
ways when ICD code was reported. However, relying on ICD9 codes for
the diagnosis may lead an underestimation of the incidence of heart
failure. A self-reported physical activity is also a limitation as it reports
physical activity over a 12 month period leading to possible errors. In
addition, the sample size was relatively small and nutrient intake data
was not available.

In conclusion, the present study suggests that low concentrations
of serum β-carotene may be associated with the increased risk of CHF
independently of established risk factors, including prevalent CHD, AF
and HF at the baseline examination, in population-based study of
middle-aged men. The clinical implication of presented results is that
the consumption of fruits and vegetables rich in β-carotene may be
beneﬁcial against arterial hypertension and CHD, and delay the devel-
opment of CHF, which may decrease costs of health care in public health
at the population level.
