Randomised controlied trialofcardioprotective dietinpatientswith recentacutemyocardialinfarction: resultsofoneyearfollowup/( Ram B&ingh, Shanti SjRastogi, RakeshLyerma, B axmi, Reematpgh, Sjhosh, Mohammad A)Niaz Abstract Objective-To testwhethera fatreduced diet rich in soluble dietary fibre, antioxidant vitamins, and minerals reduces complications and mortality after acute myocardial infarction. Design-Randomised, single blind, controiled trial. Setting-Primary and secondary care research centre for patients with myocardial infarction. Subjects-505 patients with suspected acute myocardial infarction. Those with definite or possible acute myocardial infarction and unstable angina based on World Health Organisation criteria were assigned to diet A (n=204) or diet B (n=202) within 24-48 hours ofinfarction. Interventions-Bothgroupswereadvisedtofollow a fatreduced diet.GroupAwas alsoadvisedto eat more fruit, vegetables, nuts, and grain products. Main outcome measures-Mortality from cardiac disease and other causes. Serum lipid concentrations and compliance with diet. Results-Blood lipoprotein concentrations and bodyweight feli significantlyinpatientsingroupA compared with those in group B (cholesterol feli by 0-74mmol/l ingroupAv0-32mmol/lingroupB,95% confidence interval of difference 0*14 to 070, and weightby 7-1v3-0kg, 0-52 to 7.68). Theincidence of cardiac events was significantly lower in group A thangroupB (50v82 patients, p<0-001).GroupA also had lower total mortality (21 v 38 died, p<0-01) than group B. Conclusions-Comprehensive dietary changes in conjunction withweight loss immediately afteracute myocardial infarction may modulate blood lipoproteins and significantly reduce complications and mortality afterone year. Introduction Epidemiological studies showthat diet has a definite correlation with coronary heart disease' and that the risks associated with a high fat diet remain even after the occurrence of disease and acute myocardialinfarction.2 There is evidence that hypercholesterolaemia can inhibit the secretion of endothelial dependent relaxant factor3 and predisposes to thrombosis and atherosclerosis.4 Reduction in blood lipid concentration has been shown to be associated with a significant decrease in the rate of non-fatal infarctions."8 Recently, patients having an increased intake offish afteracutemyocardialinfarctionwereshownto have a 29% decrease in all cause mortality compared with the control group after two years' follow up.9 There is consistent evidence that common Indian foods, such as onion; garlic; guava; star gooseberry;fenugreek seeds; mushrooms; black, red, and Bengal grams;trichosanthes; bittergourd;soyabeans;ground nut, soya bean, and sunflower oils; and almonds and walnuts can modulate blood concentrations of lipids and glucose and fibrinolytic activity leading to reductions in atherosclerosis.'0-'8 The clinical effects of diet rich in these foods may be the same as that of taking 180mgaspirin daily.'9Wehavepreviouslyshownthat a diet rich in fibre, antioxidant vitamins, and minerals given to patients with acute myocardial infarction significantly reduced cardiovascular events over six weeks.20Wereport the results ofaoneyear followupof patients in this experiment. Patients andmethods Detailsofmethods, baseline findings,anddesignof the study have been described.20 In brief, all patientsadmitted to our centre with a clinical diagnosis of suspected myocardial infarction (n=505) within the past 24 hours were considered for the study. Diagnosisof acute myocardial infarction was based on World Health Organisation criteria.2' Patients were included iftheyhadacutemyocardial infarction,possibleacute myocardial infarction, or unstable angina pectoris.Exclusion criteria were disliking the intervention BMJ VOLUME 304 18 APRIL 1992 1015 diet (12 patients); presence of cancer, diarrhoea, or dysentery and blood urea concentration more than 400mg/l (25); death before randomisation (20); and non-cardiac chest pain (42). Patients were kept under surveillance for 24 hours after the clinical diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction, duringwhich time dietary intake, drug treatment, and complications were recorded. Clinical, electrocardiographic, radiological, andbiochemical data werealso obtained on the patients during the first 24 hours of surveillance. Details of blood pressure measurement and criteria for presence of risk factors have been described.20 All participating patients gave written informed consent. STUDY DESIGN  and arrhythmias were diagnosed based on criteria describedearlier.20Heartfailure, left ventricularstrain, heart enlargement, and diagnosis of cardiovascular events was based on criteria described earlier.202' Information from the questionnaires was quantified by a formula. A total score of 1 indicated 100% adherence to the recommended changes in the diet, smoking, alcohol intake, and weight and 0 indicated no adherence. Patients who consumed more than our minimum recommendation of 400g/day of fruit and vegetables scored greater than 1. The scores were multiplied by 100 to convert into percentages. Biochemical data were obtained at entry to study,after six weeks, and then after one year in all the participants. A venous blood sample was drawn  Patients with suspected clinical diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction wereindividually randomised by the dietitian and pharmacists and assigned a diet by blindly selecting a precoded sequence of cards designated diet A or diet B from a stack with an equal number in each. The doctor was blind to the assigned diet. All the patients remainedin the hospital for 10-30 days. In both diets meat, eggs, hydrogenated oils, butter, and clarified butter were replaced with vegetarian meat substitutes and soya bean, sunflower, and ground nut oils so as to provide a prudent diet reflecting the recommendations ofthe American Heart Association. Group Apatients were also advised to eat fruit, vegetables, pulses, nuts, and fish.20 The goal was to provide at least 400g/day of fruits and vegetables. These foods are known for their high contents of soluble dietary fibre; free radical inhibitors vitamins A, C, E, and carotene; and minerals selenium copper, etc." 22 Inbothgroups, patients hada mainlyvegetarian diet, eating eggs 4-5 times a week and meat 1-2 times a week. Other health related advice, such as stopping sMOKMlg,reaucmigaiconou intaKe, counseoiong oreilleve mental stress and on physical activity, was given to both groups. However, though patients in groupAhad the advice regularly reinforced, those in group B were left to usual care after the initial advice. The dietitian giving the advice was not blinded. Dietary intake before admission to hospital was estimated in both groups by taking a detailed history of prestudy food intake from spouses. All the patients completed records of symptoms of angina pectoris, including daily doses oftrinitrate and other drugs, and also dietary diaries with the help of the dietitian on days 3, 6, and 10 after infarction and then every week for six weeks and finally every one to 12 weeks. Dietary compliance was checked and reinforced daily during admission to hospital (10-30 days) by a dietitian and later one to 12 weekly, depending on the seriousness ofthe infarction and frequency ofclinic visits, by showing food models and food portions and asking probing questions on diet. Each patient was counselled regularly at separate counselling sessions and asked to complete a questionnaire about dietary intake, smoking, alcohol intake, and drug intake to enforce drug and dietary compliance and to stop or reduce smoking and alcohol intake in both groups. Drug compliance was checked by counting tablets. Nutrient intakes were calculated from Indian food composition tables22 based on the results questionnaires (and weight of fruits and vegetable) completed at one year. Body weights after removing clothes and shoes were recorded by the pharmacist to the nearest 0-1 kg. DATA COLLECTION Clinical data, comnplications, drug treatment, morbidity, and mortality were regularly recorded for one year by the doctor blinded to dietary regimens. Blood pressure, heart rate, and a 12 lead electrocardiogram were recorded at frequent intervals and Whenever indicated at a visit to clinic. Angina pectoris  in a fasting state and analysed for blood counts and haemoglobin, urea, glucose, cardiac enzyme, total cholesterol,23 high and low density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglyceride,24 and electrolyte concentrations. High density lipoprotein cholesterol was measured after precipitation of very low density lipoprotein and low density lipoprotein by an enzymatic method.23 In all patients with higher blood lipid concentrations measurements were repeated to confirm the results. Cardiac enzymes were assayed as reported earlier.20 Data were analysed on the basis ofintention to treat, and in all outcome analyses during follow up last available clinical or laboratory data were incorporated for patients lost to follow up or who had died. Those patients admitted with chest pain whoshowedno signsof definite or possible acute myocardial infarction but whohad unstable angina pectoris werealso included in the analysis. Only p values <0 05 by the two tailed test were considered significant. We used Student's t test and the two sample t test to compare changes in the two groups and the Z score test to compare proportions. Results Over three years 505 patients with suspected acute myocardial infarction were considered for entry to the study, and 406 ofthem were randomly assigned to diet A or diet B. Details of baseline findings have been described.20 Ofthe 406 patients who entered the trial, 204 (mean age 50 5 (SD 9 3) years, body mass index 24-3 (1 1) kg/M2) received diet A (cardiovasoprotective) and 202 (mean age 52-0 (8 3) years, body mass index 23-3 (0-8) kg/mi2) diet B. At entry to the studyrisk factors such as male sex (180 (88%) group Av 185 (92%) group B), mean blood pressures (132-5/85-3 v 134'2/88-4mmHg), and lipoprotein concentrations, were comparable in the two groups. There were slightly more smokers (74 (36%) v 70 (35%)) and a slightly loweralcoholintake (45 (22 0%)v50 (24 7%)g/day) in group A than in group B. Sites of acute myocardial infarction as determined by electrocardiography, and initial cardiac enzymes concentrations were similar in both groups. Drug treatment, which includeddailydosesofpropranolol40-240 mg(95(46%) v88(44%)patients), verapamil 20-60mg(50'(25%) v 55 (27%)), nitrates 60-180 mg (200 (98%) v 196 (97%)),frusemide 20-80 mg (29 (14%) v 36 (18%)), and aspirin 175-355 mg (185 (91%) v 197 (98%)), was not significantly different inthetwogroups. Allthepatientsentered the trial within 24 to 48 hours of an acute myocardial infarction. The numbers ofpatients with a diagnosis of possible acute myocardial infarction (28(14%) v 36 (18%)) and unstable angina (10 (5%) v 9 (4%)) were also comparable between the two groups.Most patients had left hospital by the 11th day in both group A(165 (81%)) and group B (168(83%)).Although the nutrient intakes before entry were similar in the two groups, after one year patients in group A received a significantly higher precentage of energy from vegetable proteins; complex carbohy 1016  11BMJ  VOLUME 304  18 APRIL 1992  drates;polyunsaturatedfattyacids;fibreintheformof Bloodlipidsandglucoseconcentrations-Although fruits, vegetables, nuts; fish; and soya bean, sunflower, lipid concentrations before the trial were similar in and ground nut oils.

Despite a beneficial influence on reinfarction, none showed anyreductionindeaths. Incontrastwithourstudyinthese studies intervention was not initiated until six to eight weeks after acute myocardial infarction, and the diets didnotaimatincreasing intake ofwater soluble dietary fibre, antioxidant vitamins, and minerals.689 There is epidemiological2829 and experimental evidence that soluble dietary fibre, vitamins, and minerals may protect against coronary artery disease by decreasing blood lipids concentrations as well as by inhibiting formationoflipidperoxides,whichdamagemyocardial arterial cells."28 Both of these mechanisms are also knowntodecrease free radical generation, decrease cell acidosis, inhibitsodiumand calcium ion influx into the cell, and prevent structural and functional disorders of cell.41' Recently diets rich in fruit and vegetables have beenadvisedbytheWHOandUnited States Depart-mentofHealthandHuman Servicesforpreventionof chronic diseases.' 31 Restriction of energy intake can reduce atherosclerosis and coronary deaths32 and weight reduction may be associated with reduction in coronary artery disease and all of its risk factors.233 Weight reduction may also reduce cardiac enlargement, left ventricular strain, postexercise electrocardiographic changes, and arrhythmias,2 possibly by reducing myocardial oxygenrequirement and having other beneficial effects on cardiac indices.33 Thus thedecrease in complications in the intervention group may be due to weight loss as wellasto lipidchanges.Adecreasedintakeofclarified butter,34 adecrease inhyperinsulinaemiadue to dietarychanges, and a reduction in obesity induced coronary disease (as observed in Indian migrants35) are other possible causes for the reduction in cardiac events. Indietary trialstheissueofcompliancetoadvice isa problem because patients in the intervention group may not eat exactlywhat they are advised. The control group may also follow some intervention programme.Monitoring of dietary compliance through questionnaires is again open to bias because subjects may have simply learnt to answer what the dietitian wants to hear. However, the seriousness of illness in acute myocardial infarction tends to motivate the patients to eat and follow what they are advised and respond truthfully to questions. In conclusion, we have shown that a diet in which fruits, vegetables, cereals, nuts, and oil substitute for clarified butter, eggs, and meat together with weight reduction can significantly reduce the number of cardiac events and all cause mortality. An additional finding is the significant decrease in non-fatal acute myocardial infarction in the intervention groupcompared with the control group. A longer follow up would be necessary to confirm these observations. 1 Shakelle RB, Stamler J. Dietary cholesterol and ischaemic heart disease.
