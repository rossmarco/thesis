ELEVATED LOW-DENSITY LIPOPRO-

tein (LDL) cholesterol is a ma-
jor risk factor for coronary heart
disease (CHD).1 Dietary choles-
terol raises LDL cholesterol levels and
causes atherosclerosis in numerous
animal models.2 In controlled meta-
bolic studies conducted in humans, di-
etary cholesterol raises levels of total and
LDL cholesterol in blood,3,4 but the ef-
fects are relatively small compared with
saturated and transfatty acids.5,6 Studies
have found that individuals vary widely
in their responses to dietary cholesterol
based on monitoring their plasma lev-
els.7,8 Prospective cohort studies on the
relationship of dietary cholesterol with
risk of CHD have been inconsistent, with
a significant association found in some,9,10
but not in most studies.11-17

Context Reduction in egg consumption has been widely recommended to lower blood
cholesterol levels and prevent coronary heart disease (CHD). Epidemiologic studies on
egg consumption and risk of CHD are sparse.
Objective To examine the association between egg consumption and risk of CHD
and stroke in men and women.
Design and Setting Two prospective cohort studies, the Health Professionals Fol-
low-up Study (1986-1994) and the Nurses’ Health Study (1980-1994).
Participants A total of 37 851 men aged 40 to 75 years at study outset and 80 082
women aged 34 to 59 years at study outset, free of cardiovascular disease, diabetes,
hypercholesterolemia, or cancer.
MainOutcomeMeasures Incidentnonfatalmyocardialinfarction,fatalCHD,andstroke
corresponding to daily egg consumption as determined by a food-frequency questionnaire.
Results We documented 866 incident cases of CHD and 258 incident cases of stroke
in men during 8 years of follow-up and 939 incident cases of CHD and 563 incident cases
of stroke in women during 14 years of follow-up. After adjustment for age, smoking,
and other potential CHD risk factors, we found no evidence of an overall significant as-
sociation between egg consumption and risk of CHD or stroke in either men or women.
The relative risks (RRs) of CHD across categories of intake were less than 1 per week (1.0),
1 per week (1.06), 2 to 4 per week (1.12), 5 to 6 per week (0.90), and $1 per day (1.08)
(P for trend = .75) for men; and less than 1 per week (1.0), 1 per week (0.82), 2 to 4 per
week (0.99), 5 to 6 per week (0.95), and $1 per day (0.82) (P for trend = .95) for women.
In subgroup analyses, higher egg consumption appeared to be associated with increased
risk of CHD only among diabetic subjects (RR of CHD comparing more than 1 egg per
day with less than 1 egg per week among diabetic men, 2.02 [95% confidence interval,
1.05-3.87; P for trend = .04], and among diabetic women, 1.49 [0.88-2.52; P for
trend = .008]).
Conclusions These findings suggest that consumption of up to 1 egg per day is un-
likely to have substantial overall impact on the risk of CHD or stroke among healthy
men and women. The apparent increased risk of CHD associated with higher egg con-
sumption among diabetic participants warrants further research.

besides cholesterol, including unsatur-
ated fats, essential amino acids, folate,
and other B vitamins. In addition, con-
sumption of eggs instead of carbohy-
drate-rich foods may raise high-density
lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol lev-
els19,20 and decrease blood glycemic and
insulinemic responses.21 For these rea-
sons, it is useful to study directly the re-
lationship of egg consumption with risk
of CHD, but few epidemiologic studies
have addressed this association.22-24 In
this article, we examine prospectively the
association between egg consumption
and risk of CHD and stroke in 2 large co-
horts of men and women.

METHODS
The Health Professionals
Follow-up Study
The Health Professionals Follow-up
Study (HPFS) began in 1986 when
51 529 men who were US health pro-
fessionals (dentists, optometrists, phar-
macists, podiatrists, and veterinar-
ians), aged 40 to 75 years, answered a
detailed questionnaire that included a
comprehensive diet survey and items
on lifestyle practice and medical his-
tory. Follow-up questionnaires were
sent in 1988, 1990, 1992, and 1994 to
update information on potential risk
factors and to identify newly diag-
nosed cases of cardiovascular and other
diseases. We excluded from the analy-
sis men who did not satisfy the a priori
criteria of reported daily energy in-
take between 3360 and 17 640 kJ or
who left blank more than 70 items of
the 131 total food items in the diet ques-
tionnaire (n = 1152). We also excluded
men with prior diagnoses of cardiovas-
cular disease (n = 5182) or cancer
(n = 1644) at baseline. In the primary
analyses, we also excluded men who re-
ported diabetes mellitus (n = 1187) or
hypercholesterolemia (n = 4458) at
baseline because these diagnoses could
have led to changes in diet. Incidence
of CHD and stroke during the sub-
sequent 8 years was monitored for
37 851 men during follow-up. The fol-
low-up rate for nonfatal events was 97%
of the total potential person-years of
follow-up.

The Nurses’ Health Study
The Nurses’ Health Study (NHS) co-
hort was established in 1976 when
121 700 women who were registered
nurses residing in 11 large states, aged
30 to 55 years, provided detailed infor-
mation about their medical history and
lifestyle characteristics.25 Every 2 years,
follow-up questionnaires have been sent
to update information on potential risk
factors and to identify newly diag-
nosed cases of CHD, stroke, and other
diseases. In 1980, a 61-item food fre-
quency questionnaire was included to
assess intake of specific fats and other
nutrients. In 1984, the food frequency
questionnaire was expanded to in-
clude 116 items. Similar question-
naires were used to update diet in 1986
and 1990. The reproducibility and va-
lidity of the food frequency question-
naires have been described in detail else-
where.26,27

After up to 4 mailings, 98 462 women
returned the 1980 diet questionnaire.
We excluded those who left 10 or more
items blank, those with implausibly
high or low scores for total food in-
take or energy intake (ie, ,2100 kJ/d
or .14 700 kJ/d) (n = 5994), and those
with previously diagnosed cancer
(n = 3526), cardiovascular disease
(n = 1812), high blood cholesterol
(n = 1821), or diabetes (n = 4122) at
baseline. Incidence of CHD and stroke
during the subsequent 14 years was
monitored for 80 082 women during
follow-up. The follow-up rate for non-
fatal events was 98% of the total po-
tential person-years of follow-up.

Assessment of Egg Consumption
Validated dietary questionnaires were
sent to the HPFS participants in 1986
and 1990 and the NHS participants in
1980, 1984, 1986, and 1990. In all the
questionnaires, we asked the partici-
pants how often, on average, during the
previous year they had consumed eggs
(unit of consumption was 1 egg). Nine
responses were possible, ranging from
never to 6 or more times per day. We
divided the participants into 5 catego-
ries (,1 per week, 1 per week, 2-4 per
week, 5-6 per week, $1 per day) based

on the frequency distribution of egg
consumption. In a validation study in
a subsample of the participants, the cor-
relation coefficent between intakes of
eggs assessed by the diet question-
naire and by multiple week diet re-
cords was 0.8 for both men28 and
women.29 We also computed intake of
eggs included in other foods such as
cakes, cookies, pancakes, muffins, sweet
rolls, and donuts. The amount of eggs
estimated from other foods was rela-
tively small in both cohorts (men, 0.4
egg per week; women, 0.3 egg per
week), so we used the reported egg con-
sumption as our primary exposure vari-
able. In a secondary analysis, we ex-
amined the effect of computed total egg
consumption.

End Points
The end points were incident CHD (in-
cluding nonfatal myocardial infarction
[MI] and fatal CHD) and stroke occur-
ring between return of the baseline ques-
tionnaires and January 31, 1994 (men),
or June 1, 1994 (women). We inquired
about occurrence of cardiovascular end
points on each biennial questionnaire.
Participants reporting an incident MI or
stroke were asked for permission to re-
view medical records. Nonfatal MI was
confirmed by symptoms plus either typi-
cal electrocardiographic changes or in-
creased activities in cardiac enzymes
(World Health Organization criteria).30
Infarctions that required hospital admis-
sion and for which confirmatory infor-
mation was obtained by interview or let-
ter, but for which no medical records
were available, were designated as prob-
able. We included all confirmed and
probable cases in the analyses because
results were the same after excluding
probable cases. Strokes were confirmed
if characterized by a typical neurologi-
cal defect of sudden or rapid onset, last-
ing at least 24 hours, and attributable to
a cerebrovascular event. Strokes caused
by infection or neoplasia were ex-
cluded. Strokes were subclassified ac-
cording to the criteria of the National Sur-
vey of Stroke as due to ischemia
(embolism or thrombosis), subarach-
noid hemorrhage, intracerebral hemor-

rhage, or unknown cause.31 If no rec-
ords could be obtained, strokes were
considered probable if they required hos-
pitalization and were corroborated by ad-
ditional information provided by letter
or interview.

Deaths were reported by next of kin,
coworkers, postal authorities, or the Na-
tional Death Index. Using all sources
combined, we estimate that follow-up
for the deaths was more than 98% com-
plete.32 Fatal CHD was defined as fatal
MI if this was confirmed by hospital rec-
ords or autopsy, or if CHD was listed
as the cause of death on the death cer-
tificate and this was the underlying and
most plausible cause, and evidence of
previous CHD was available. The state-
ment of the cause of death on the death
certificate was never relied on by itself
as providing sufficient confirmation of
death due to CHD. Sudden death within
an hour of the onset of symptoms in
subjects with no other plausible cause
of death (other than coronary disease)
was also included. Fatal stroke was also
confirmed by medical records or au-
topsy reports, or considered probable
if these were not obtainable but stroke
was listed as the underlying cause on
the death certificate.

Statistical Analysis
Participants contributed follow-up time
from the return of the 1986 (men) or the
1980 (women) questionnaire up to the
occurrence of a confirmed end point,
death, or the end of follow-up (January
31, 1994, for men and June 1, 1994, for
women). The relative risks (RRs) were
calculated by dividing the incidence of
CHD or stroke among men and women
in various categories of egg consump-
tion by the incidence among those in the
lowest category of intake (,1 egg per
week), adjusting for age (5-year catego-
ries). To adjust for other risk factors, we
used pooled logistic regression,33 which
is asymptotically equivalent to Cox re-
gression for time-dependent covari-
ates. Multivariate models included as co-
variates were (1) total energy intake
(quintiles); (2) smoking (never, past,
current 1-14, 15-24, and $25 cigarettes/
d); (3) alcohol consumption (0-4, 5-9,

10-14, 15-29, and $30 g/d); (4) his-
tory of hypertension; (5) parental his-
tory of MI; (6) body mass index (calcu-
lated as weight in kilograms divided by
the square of height in meters) (quin-
tiles); and (7) current multivitamin use,
and (8) vitamin E supplement use. In
HPFS, we also adjusted for physical ac-
tivity in metabolic equivalents per week
(quintiles).34 In NHS, we adjusted for
regular vigorous exercise (once or more
per week) and menopausal status and
postmenopausal hormone use. Tests of
linear trend across increasing catego-
ries of egg consumption were con-
ducted by treating the median values of
consumption in categories (servings per
day) as a continuous variable.

To reduce intra-individual varia-
tion and best represent long-term diet,
we used repeated measures of diet in
our primary analyses.35 In particular,
CHD or stroke incidence was related to
the cumulative average of egg consump-
tion from all available questionnaires
prior to the beginning of each 2-year
follow-up interval. For example, in
HPFS, CHD or stroke incidence dur-
ing the 1986-1990 period was related
to egg consumption assessed in 1986,
while the incidence during 1990-
1994 period was related to the average
intake assessed in 1986 and 1990. For
those who failed to complete the 1990
diet questionnaire (24%), we used the
1986 values to replace the missing val-
ues and a missing data indicator was in-
cluded in the model to correct for po-
tential bias. Average egg consumption
at baseline was the same between the
respondents and nonrespondents. In al-
ternative analyses, we analyzed the in-
cidence of CHD in relationship to egg
consumption at baseline only. We also
related the incidence to the most re-
cent diet by using the baseline diet to
predict incidence during 1986-1990,
and the 1990 diet to predict incidence
during 1990-1994. Because the diag-
nosis of hypercholesterolemia, diabe-
tes, or hypertension may lead to
changes in egg consumption and there-
fore confound the associations be-
tween egg consumption and risk of car-
diovascular disease, we did not update

diets for those who developed these
conditions.35

RESULTS
In men, the average egg consumption
declined from 2.3 eggs per week in 1986
to 1.6 eggs per week in 1990. In women,
the average egg consumption de-
clined from 2.8 eggs per week in 1980
to 1.4 eggs per week in 1990. At base-
line, egg consumption was positively as-
sociated with smoking in men but in-
versely associated with smoking in
women (TABLE 1). Those with higher
egg intake consumed more dietary cho-
lesterol and protein but less carbohy-
drates. Egg consumption was posi-
tively associated with bacon intake
among both men (r = 0.35) and women
(r = 0.21). Men with higher egg con-
sumption were more likely to con-
sume whole milk, red meat, and bread,
and less likely to consume skim milk,
chicken, vegetables, and fruits. These
relationships were less clear in women.

Association With CHD
We documented 866 incident cases of
CHD in men during 8 years of fol-
low-up (1986-1994) and 939 cases of
CHD in women during 14 years of fol-
low-up (1980-1994). The age-adjusted
RR of CHD comparing more than 1 egg
per day with less than 1 egg per week
was 1.15 (95% confidence interval [CI],
0.85-1.55; P for trend = .37) for men and
0.85 (95% CI, 0.62-1.16; P for
trend = .50) for women (TABLE 2). Af-
ter adjustment for smoking and other co-
variates, the corresponding RRs were
1.08 (95% CI, 0.79-1.48; P for
trend = .75) for men and 0.82 (95% CI,
0.60-1.13; P for trend = .95) for women.
Additional adjustment for dietary fiber
intake had little impact on the RRs for
women but it further attenuated the as-
sociation for men (RR for .1 egg per
day, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.74-1.38). Because
of the relatively strong correlation be-
tween consumption of eggs and bacon,
we further adjusted for bacon intake.
The adjusted RRs across categories of egg
consumption are less than 1 per week
(1.0), 1 per week (1.00), 2 to 4 per week
(1.04), 5 to 6 per week (0.78), and 1 or

more per day (0.93) (P for trend = .36)
for men; and less than 1 per week (1.0),
1 per week (0.81), 2 to 4 per week
(0.96), 5 to 6 per week (0.91), and 1 or
more per day (0.78) (P for trend = .73)
for women. Additional adjustment for
other foods including whole milk, fish,
beef as main dish, chicken, or cereal had
little impact on the results.

In further analyses egg consump-
tion had no significant relationship with
either fatal CHD or nonfatal MI (data
not shown). After excluding cases with
events occurring during the first 2 years
of follow-up to reduce the effect of
change in diet due to preclinical con-
ditions, the results remained un-
changed. In analyses excluding partici-

pants who reported changes in egg
consumption in the previous decade
from baseline, we observed a signifi-
cant inverse association for men but a
nonsignificant positive association for
women. The results from analyses in-
cluding eggs estimated from other foods
were similar to those from the main
analyses. We also observed no signifi-

cant increase in risk when either only
baseline or only recent egg consump-
tion was analyzed. Only 4.8% women
reported almost never consuming eggs
and 1.6% women reported consuming
2 eggs or more per day. When these 2
extreme groups were compared (us-
ing never consumers as the reference
group), the multivariate RR was 0.76
(95% CI, 0.43-1.35). The correspond-
ing RR was 1.10 (95% CI, 0.67-1.79)
for men.

In all above analyses, participants
with diabetes or hypercholesterol-
emia at baseline were excluded. When
these subjects were included in the
analyses, the results did not apprecia-
bly change. The multivariate RRs as in
Table 2 across categories of egg intake
were less than 1 per week (1.0), 1 per
week (1.05), 2 to 4 per week (1.04), 5
to 6 per week (0.96), and 1 or more per
day (1.10) (95% CI, 0.83-1.45; P for
trend = .78) for men; and less than 1 per
week (1.0), 1 per week (0.87), 2 to 4
per week (0.98), 5 to 6 per week (1.03),
and 1 or more per day (0.95) (95% CI,
0.74-1.22; P for trend = .54) for women.

Associations According
to Risk Factor Status
To examine the possibility that a posi-
tive association with egg intake is lim-
ited to certain subgroups, we con-
ducted additional multivariate analyses
stratified by risk factor status includ-
ing hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, hy-
pertension, smoking, alcohol use, body

mass index, age, vitamin supplement
use, parental history of MI, and in-
takes of saturated fat, polyunsaturated
fat, and carbohydrates. We found no
evidence of a positive association with
higher consumption of eggs in any sub-
group except a suggestion that the risk
might be elevated among individuals
with diabetes. Among diabetic men, the
multivariate RRs of CHD across cat-
egories of intake were less than 1 per
week (1.0), 1 per week (1.0), 2 to 4 per
week (1.16), 5 to 6 per week (1.16), and
1 or more eggs per day (2.02); (95% CI,
1.05-3.87; P = .04 for trend and P = .18
for interaction between egg consump-
tion and diabetes status). The corre-
sponding RRs for diabetic women were
1.0, 0.91, 1.05, 1.87, and 1.49 (95% CI,
0.88-2.52; P = .008 for trend and P = .07
for interaction). To investigate the pos-
sibility that an effect of egg consump-
tion may be more apparent among those
with a low-background cholesterol
diet,36 we conducted analyses strati-
fied by dietary cholesterol from foods
other than eggs. The RRs for more than
1 eggs per day were 1.05 (95% CI, 0.61-
1.79) for the men and 0.97 (95% CI,
0.13-7.10) for the women whose non-
egg cholesterol intake was low (mean
intakes were 88.4 mg/4200 kJ for men
and 118.8 mg/4200 kJ for women),
compared with 0.97 (95% CI, 0.64-
1.46) for the men and 0.79 (95% CI,
0.57-1.11) for the women whose non-
egg cholesterol intake was relatively
high (mean intakes were 135.9 mg/

4200 kJ for men and 175.9 mg/4200 kJ
for women).

The Association With Stroke
We documented 258 incident cases of
stroke in men during 8 years of fol-
low-up and 563 cases of stroke in
women during 14 years of follow-up.
In multivariate analyses (TABLE 3), egg
consumption was not significantly as-
sociated with risk of total stroke; the
RRs for 1 egg or more per day were 1.07
(95% CI, 0.66-1.75; P for trend = .50)
for men and 0.89 (95% CI, 0.60-1.31;
P for trend = .77) for women. Adjust-
ment for intake of bacon, vegetables,
and fruit further attenuated the asso-
ciation for men (RR for $1 egg per day,
1.00; 95% CI, 0.57-1.78; P for trend =
0.95). In both cohorts, no significant
association was observed between egg
consumption and risk of ischemic or
hemorrhagic stroke.

COMMENT
In these 2 large prospective cohort stud-
ies of men and women, we found no
overall significant association be-
tween egg consumption (up to 1 egg per
day) and risk of CHD or stroke. We spe-
cifically found no evidence for a sig-
nificant increase in risk with either re-
cent or relatively long-term (over the
past decade) egg consumption. De-
spite somewhat different patterns of egg
consumption in men and women, the
results from the 2 cohorts were remark-
ably consistent.

In subgroup analyses, egg consump-
tion appeared to be associated with in-
creased risk of CHD among individu-
als with diabetes. This result should be
interpreted cautiously due to numer-
ous subgroup analyses, but the consis-
tency of the association in the 2 co-
horts argues against a chance finding.
The increased risk may be related to ab-
normal cholesterol transport due to de-
creased levels of apolipoprotein E37 and
increased levels of apolipoprotein C-
III38 among patients with diabetes.

We considered the possibility that in-
accurate self-reports of egg consump-
tion or confounding by intake of other
foods could explain the observed null
results. Egg consumption was re-
ported on food frequency question-
naires with relatively high accuracy
(correlations were 0.8 between the self-
report and multiple week dietary re-
cords in our validation studies28,29).
Also, egg consumption was assessed
several times in both cohorts so that our
analyses using updated dietary infor-
mation could dampen measurement er-
ror and take into account changes in
eating behavior.

Several metabolic studies have sug-
gested a hypocholesterolemic effect of
decholesterolized eggs (ie, Eggbeaters)
on blood cholesterol levels compared
with whole eggs.39,40 We were not able
to examine the effect of such products
on the risk of CHD because they were
not included in the dietary question-
naires on the printed form. However, our
questionnaires permit respondents to re-
port other foods that are frequently con-
sumed. In NHS, only 48 women re-
corded consuming Eggbeaters in the
1984 dietary questionnaire and 105 re-
corded this in the 1990 questionnaire.
Egg consumption was positively as-
sociated with smoking, lower physical
activity, and a generally unhealthy eat-
ing pattern (ie, more whole milk, red
meat, and bacon and less skim milk,
vegetables, and fruits) in men. Con-
founding due to these factors would ar-
tifactually produce an elevated risk for
egg consumption. As expected, an ap-
parent positive association with higher
egg consumption in the age-adjusted
analysis in men was attenuated after ad-
justment for smoking and other covar-
iates. After further adjusting for bacon

intake, which was positively associ-
ated with risk of CHD in our cohorts,
the RRs became weakly inverse. This
speaks to the importance of consider-
ing overall eating patterns when exam-
ining the effects of egg consumption.
It is possible that participants with
high serum cholesterol levels were more
likely to reduce their egg intake than oth-
ers, which might obscure a positive as-
sociation between egg consumption and
risk of CHD. However, in our primary
analyses, we excluded subjects with di-
agnosed hypercholesterolemia at base-
line. Also, in our analyses by using up-
dated dietary information, we stopped
updating egg consumption at the begin-
ning of the time interval during which
individuals reported hypercholesterol-
emia to avoid confounding due to change
in diet during follow-up.41 Finally, we did
not measure blood cholesterol levels in
our cohorts. However, blood choles-
terol should not be controlled in the
analyses as it is an intermediate variable
when assessing the relationship be-
tween dietary cholesterol and CHD.

gestion of cholesterol by eating egg

yolks or whole eggs raises serum total
and LDL cholesterol levels.5-7,42 In most
egg feeding studies, intakes of other nu-
trients such as fatty acids, carbohy-
drates, and protein were balanced be-
tween egg and no egg groups so that
only dietary cholesterol varied. In our
cohorts, participants who consumed
more eggs had lower intakes of carbo-
hydrates, suggesting that, in reality,
people often substitute eggs for carbo-
hydrate-rich foods such as breakfast ce-
reals. The effects of egg cholesterol on
blood cholesterol can be predicted from
well-established equations derived from
metabolic studies. A 50-g egg contains
about 213 mg of cholesterol, 6 g of pro-
tein, and 5 g of fat.43 Of the fat, nearly
half is monounsaturated fat and 16% is
polyunsaturated fat. The equation de-
rived by Keys and Parlin4 predicts that
adding 1 egg to an average diet (as-
sume 200 mg background cholesterol
and 7560 kJ/d) will result in about a 4%
increase in total serum cholesterol for
a normocholesterolemic person (as-
sume total blood cholesterol of 5.17
mmol/L [200 mg/dL]). If we assume
that raising cholesterol levels is the only
effect of egg consumption, this would
translate into about an 8% increase in
CHD risk,44 an effect generally too small
to be detectable in this and most epi-
demiologic studies or clinical trials. In
NHS, dietary cholesterol (but not eggs)
was nonsignificantly associated with
CHD,17 raising the possibility that eggs
contain other nutrients that may be ben-
eficial in preventing CHD.

The equation developed by Men-
sink and Katan45 predicts that substi-
tuting fatty acids from 1 egg for carbo-
hydrates would raise HDL cholesterol
by about 2% (assume HDL level of 1.03
mmol/L [40 mg/dL]) and decrease tri-
glycerides also by about 2% (assume tri-
glyceride level of 2.82 mmol/L [250 mg/
dL]). The effects of egg consumption
on raising HDL levels have been ob-
served in some metabolic studies,19,20
but not in others.36,40 Also, in egg feed-
ing studies, triglyceride levels were sig-
nificantly reduced in some,19,20 but not
other studies.36,46 In particular, Schnohr
et al19 observed a reduction of triglyc-

erides by 0.09 mmol/L (7.97 mg/dL) by
adding 2 eggs to the usual diet. Pack-
ard et al20 observed a reduction of tri-
glycerides by 0.19 mmol/L (16.8 mg/
dL) by adding 6 eggs to the diet. In
addition, egg intake decreased blood
glycemic and insulinemic responses,47
especially when egg yolk was ingested
(compared with whole egg or egg
white).21 This might result from fur-
ther delayed gastric emptying after yolk
ingestion. Moreover, adding eggs to
pasta produced lower insulin and C-
peptide responses.48 Holt et al49 tested
38 common foods and found that eggs
were among the foods that have the
lowest glycemic and insulin indexes.
Based on the 116 food items in the
1984 food frequency questionnaire in
NHS, we estimated that egg consump-
tion contributed to 32% of total dietary
cholesterol. Eggs also made contribu-
tions to dietary intakes of many other
nutrients, including vitamin D (5%),
retinol (4%), folate (4%), a-tocopherol
(3%), monounsaturated fat (3%), vita-
min B12 (3%), vitamin B2 (3%), protein
(3%), saturated fat (2.5%), linoleic acid
(2%), calcium (1.3%), vitamin B1 (1.2%),
and vitamin B2 (1.2%). It is conceiv-
able that the small adverse effect of cho-
lesterol in an egg on plasma LDL levels
is counterbalanced by potential benefi-
cial effects on HDL and triglycerides, and
of other nutrients including antioxi-
dants, folate, other B vitamins, and un-
saturated fats. Since there is no single
biochemical measurement that can rep-
resent the effects of various nutrients, it
is important to examine the direct rela-
tionship between egg consumption and
risk of CHD. Only 2 previous prospec-
tive cohort studies reported on the as-
sociation between egg consumption and
risk of CHD. In the Framingham Study,
egg consumption was not significantly
associated with either serum choles-
terol or risk of CHD (RR was not pro-
vided).22 In the California Adventists
Study, the RR for higher intake ($3 per
week) vs lowest intake (,1 per week)
was 1.01.23 In a case-control study con-
ducted in Italy,24 the RR comparing
women in the upper third of egg intake
with those in the lower third was 0.8.

One potential alternative explana-
tion for the null finding is that back-
ground dietary cholesterol may be so
high in the usual Western diet that add-
ing somewhat more has little further ef-
fect on blood cholesterol. In a random-
ized trial, Sacks et al36 found that adding
1 egg per day to the usual diet of 17 lac-
tovegetarians whose habitual choles-
terol intake was very low (97 mg/d) sig-
nificantly increased LDL cholesterol
level by 12%. In our analyses, differ-
ences in non-egg cholesterol intake did
not appear to be an explanation for the
null association between egg consump-
tion and risk of CHD. However, we can-
not exclude the possibility that egg con-
sumption may increase the risk among
participants with very low back-
ground cholesterol intake. Also, we
have limited power to examine the ef-
fect of high egg consumption (eg, $2
eggs per day). Nevertheless, the aver-
age egg consumption was 0.64 eggs per
day in 1995 in the United States,50
which is well within the range of con-
sumption in our analyses.

We found no significant association
between egg consumption and risk of to-
tal stroke or its subtype. Epidemiologic
studies51 have revealed no clear pat-
terns between blood cholesterol and
stroke although secondary prevention
trials52,53 showed significant reductions
in stroke incidence among patients with
MIs and who were treated with choles-
terol-lowering drugs (statins). A recent
report from the Framingham Heart
Study54 indicated that intakes of total fat,
saturated fat, and monounsaturated fat
were associated with reduced risk of
ischemic stroke, but the study did not
examine the effects of dietary choles-
terol or egg consumption.

In conclusion, our data suggest that
consumption of up to 1 egg per day is un-
likely to have substantial overall impact
on the risk of cardiovascular disease
among healthy men and women. The ap-
parent increased risk of CHD associated
with higher egg consumption among
diabetics warrants further research.
