BSTRACT
Background
Several  studies  have  shown  U-  or
J-shaped relations between alcohol consumption and
the risk of stroke. We evaluated the effect of light-to-
moderate  alcohol  intake  on  the  risk  of  stroke,  with
separate analyses of ischemic stroke and hemorrhag-
ic stroke.
Methods
Our analyses were based on a prospec-
tive cohort study of 22,071 male physicians, 40 to 84
years old, who were participating in the Physicians’
Health Study. At base line, the participants reported
that they had no history of stroke, transient ischemic
attack, or myocardial infarction and were free of can-
cer. Alcohol intake, reported by 21,870 participants at
base line, ranged from none or almost none to two
or more drinks per day.
Results
During an average of 12.2 years of follow-
up, 679 strokes were reported. As compared with par-
ticipants who had less than one drink per week, those
who drank more had a reduced overall risk of stroke
(relative risk, 0.79; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.66
to 0.94) and a reduced risk of ischemic stroke (rela-
tive risk, 0.77; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.63 to
0.94).  There  was  no  statistically  significant  associa-
tion between alcohol consumption and hemorrhagic
stroke. The overall relative risks of stroke for the men
who had one drink per week, two to four drinks per
week,  five  or  six  drinks  per  week,  or  one  or  more
drinks per day were 0.78 (95 percent confidence inter-
val, 0.59 to 1.04), 0.75 (95 percent confidence interval,
0.58 to 0.96), 0.83 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.62
to 1.11), and 0.80 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.64
to 0.99), respectively, in an analysis in which we con-
trolled for major risk factors for stroke.
Conclusions
Light-to-moderate alcohol consump-
tion reduces the overall risk of stroke and the risk of
ischemic stroke in men. The benefit is apparent with
as little as one drink per week. Greater consumption,
up  to  one  drink  per  day,  does  not  increase  the  ob-
served benefit. (N Engl J Med 1999;341:1557-64.)

TROKE is a leading cause of morbidity and
mortality in many countries.
 Among the risk
1
factors  for  stroke,  potentially  hazardous  but
modifiable behavior such as alcohol consump-
tion has drawn increasing attention in recent years,
especially after a 
-shaped relation was suggested be-
tween  alcohol  consumption  and  coronary  heart  dis-
ease.
 Alcohol consumption is a modifiable behavior,
2
and drinking moderate amounts of alcohol may have
protective  effects  against  subtypes  of  stroke.
  Al-
though most studies show a positive correlation be-
tween drinking and the risk of hemorrhagic stroke,
3,7-10
the relation with ischemic stroke is less clear.

Studies in North America and Europe have found
a 
-shaped association, suggesting that mod-
- or 
J
U
erate  consumption  of  alcohol  provides  protection
against ischemic stroke.
 However, the definition
of  moderate  consumption  has  differed  substantially
among studies. Some definitions were based on the
frequency of alcohol consumption
 and others on the
16
amount (in grams or units per day).
 In various stud-
15
ies, the categories associated with the lowest risk of
 1 to 33 g
ischemic stroke were 1 to 150 g per week,
per day,

ease were criticized, since most of the studies com-
pared alcohol drinkers with nondrinkers. The latter
group  might  have  included  people  who  abstained
from alcohol because of poor health.
 However,
subsequent studies that excluded “sick quitters” from
the analysis found the same 

-shaped relation.

Using data from the Physicians’ Health Study, we
prospectively examined the associations between al-
cohol consumption and stroke and evaluated poten-
tial modifications of these relations by other risk fac-
tors for stroke.

METHODS

Study Design

25

26

The Physicians’ Health Study

 was a randomized, double-blind,
placebo-controlled trial designed to test the effect of low-dose as-
pirin on the risk of cardiovascular disease and the effect of beta
carotene on the risk of cancer.
 Briefly, 22,071 U.S. male physi-
cians, who were 40 to 84 years of age at the time of enrollment in
1982, were randomly assigned to receive aspirin, beta carotene,
both agents, or placebo according to a two-by-two factorial de-
sign. All participants reported at base line that they did not have
a  history  of  stroke,  transient  ischemic  attack,  myocardial  infarc-
tion, active liver disease, or peptic ulcer disease. In January 1988
the aspirin component of the study was terminated early because
of a statistically significant 44 percent reduction in the risk of a
first myocardial infarction among physicians in the aspirin group.
25
The  beta  carotene  component  of  the  study  continued  until  its
scheduled termination on December 31, 1995. This report includes
data available as of October 1995, when the participants had been
followed for an average of 12.2 years. Follow-up data on morbid-
ity and mortality were available for more than 99 percent of the
study participants.

Information  was  collected  at  base  line  by  means  of  a  mailed
questionnaire, which included questions about alcohol consump-
tion;  age;  height;  weight;  systolic  and  diastolic  blood  pressure;
history  of  angina  pectoris,  diabetes  mellitus,  and  hypertension;
and cigarette smoking. At base line, 21,870 of the physicians re-
sponded  to  the  following  question  about  alcohol  consumption:
“How  often  do  you  usually  consume  alcoholic  beverages  (beer,
wine, or liquor)?” The possible responses were rarely or never, one
to three per month, one per week, two to four per week, five or
six per week, one per day, or two or more per day.
 These re-
sponses were interpreted as the number of drinks consumed per
unit of time. Alcohol consumption was reassessed at 84 months of
follow-up, and a high correlation was found between these respons-
es and the responses at base line. Systolic and diastolic blood pres-
sure  were  self-reported  blood-pressure  levels  at  base  line.  Vali-
dation studies of physician-measured blood pressure show a high
correlation with self-reports of systolic pressure (r=0.72) and di-
astolic pressure (r=0.60, P<0.001 for both comparisons).

Every six months for the first year and annually thereafter, the
participants  were  mailed  questionnaires  requesting  information
about their compliance with the randomized treatment assignment
and about newly diagnosed conditions, including stroke and tran-
sient ischemic attack. Deaths were usually reported by family mem-
bers or by the postal authorities and were verified by a review of
all available medical records, death certificates, and eyewitness ac-
counts, if relevant. Only first cases of stroke were counted. A di-
agnosis of stroke was confirmed only after medical records and
all  other  available  information  had  been  reviewed  by  the  End
Points Committee (consisting of two internists, one cardiologist,
and one neurologist, who were unaware of the treatment assign-
ments). A stroke was defined as a focal neurologic deficit of vas-
cular  mechanism  that  lasted  more  than  24  hours.  Strokes  were
classified according to the probable mechanism (ischemic or hem-
orrhagic) on the basis of medical records, reports of brain imag-
ing, and the judgment of the neurologist on the End Points Com-

mittee.  There  was  a  high  level  of  interobserver  agreement  in
the diagnosis of hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke throughout the
study.
 Cases of fatal stroke were documented by evidence of a
cerebrovascular mechanism obtained from all available sources, in-
cluding death certificates and hospital records.

Statistical Analysis

30

Since only 674 physicians reported that they consumed alcohol
two or more times a day, this highest category of alcohol intake
was combined with the second highest category (once a day). The
categories rarely or never and one to three times a month were
also combined to form a larger reference group. Cox proportional-
hazards models
 were used to estimate the relative risk of stroke
associated with alcohol consumption. We calculated relative risks
for the total group of participants with stroke (ischemic or hem-
orrhagic, hereafter referred to as total stroke) and for participants
with  each  subtype  of  stroke  when  age,  systolic  blood  pressure,
smoking, body-mass index (defined as the weight in kilograms di-
vided by the square of the height in meters), exercise, history of
diabetes, current treatment for hypertension, and randomized treat-
ment  assignment  were  controlled  for.  Tests  of  linear  trend  were
performed by using each category as an ordinal variable in the pro-
portional-hazards models. The assumption of proportional hazards
was tested and was not violated. Age, body-mass index, smoking,
systolic blood pressure, and exercise were analyzed for their effect
on the association between alcohol consumption and stroke. For
this  analysis,  an  interaction  term  for  alcohol  consumption  and
each variable was included in separate models.

RESULTS

During an average of 12.2 years of follow-up, 679
first  strokes  were  reported  (557  ischemic  strokes,
88 hemorrhagic strokes, and 34 strokes of unknown
type). Table 1 shows base-line characteristics of the
participants according to categories of alcohol con-
sumption. The mean systolic and diastolic blood pres-
sures were lowest among participants who had one
to  four  drinks  per  week  and  were  highest  among
those in the two highest categories of alcohol con-
sumption.  The  proportion  of  participants  with  hy-
pertension was higher among those in the two high-
est  categories  of  alcohol  consumption  than  among
those in the other categories. The percentage of men
who had never smoked decreased consistently with
increasing alcohol intake. The percentage of current
smokers was significantly higher among the men who
had  at  least  one  drink  per  day  than  among  those
who consumed less alcohol. The percentage of men
who were overweight (body-mass index, »27.8) de-
creased with increasing alcohol intake.

The overall effect of alcohol consumption on the
risk of total stroke, ischemic stroke, and hemorrhag-
ic stroke is shown in Table 2. The men who had less
than one drink per week were chosen as the refer-
ence group. After adjustment for major risk factors
for  stroke,  there  were  significant  reductions  in  the
risk of total stroke (21 percent) and ischemic stroke
(23 percent) among the men who had one or more
drinks a week. No statistically significant association
was observed between alcohol consumption and hem-
orrhagic stroke.

The relative risk of total stroke according to the lev-
el of alcohol consumption is shown in Table 3. After

least once a week.

DISCUSSION

The focus of this analysis was the relation between
light-to-moderate alcohol consumption and the risk
of stroke. The Physicians’ Health Study offered the
opportunity to evaluate the relatively narrow range of
alcohol intake of one to seven drinks per week (i.e.,
light-to-moderate  intake,  accounting  for  about  97
percent of our sample27), corresponding to the ben-
eficial part of the U- or J-shaped relation between al-
cohol consumption and stroke that other studies have
suggested.  We  found  an  L-shaped  association  be-
tween alcohol intake and total stroke, with a risk re-
duction  of  about  20  percent  after  adjustment  for
important confounders. The shape of this relation cor-
responds to the first part of the J-shaped curve shown
by other studies.3,6 The benefit was observed among
physicians who had only one alcoholic drink per week,
and the magnitude of this protective effect did not
increase  with  increased  alcohol  consumption.  The
relation between alcohol consumption and ischemic
stroke had the same flat shape, and the risk reduc-
tions were similar in magnitude.

The protective effect of light-to-moderate drinking
with  respect  to  total  stroke  or  ischemic  stroke  has
varied considerably, with risk reductions of 20 to 90
percent found in other studies.3,4 A recent population-
based case–control study reported an odds ratio of
0.51 for ischemic stroke in the group with moderate
alcohol consumption.6 Most cohort studies have re-
ported risk reductions of 20 to 40 percent. Our result
is similar in magnitude. However, our population dif-

fers from that in other studies in that it consists of
healthy men of high socioeconomic and education-
al status. Their risk-factor profile differs substantially
from that of men in the general U.S. population. In
particular, only 3.1 percent of the participants in our
study  reported  that  they  had  more  than  one  drink
per day,27 confirming that heavy drinking was very rare
in this population. For this reason, it is not possible
to draw any conclusions about the participants who
reported having two or more drinks per day.

Like other studies involving predominantly white
populations, our study showed that the majority of
strokes were ischemic; only 13 percent were hemor-
rhagic. This finding explains the similarity of the re-
lations of alcohol consumption with total stroke and
with ischemic stroke.

In prior studies, the beneficial effect of alcohol on
the risk of stroke was observed over a rather broad
range of alcohol intake (e.g., 1 to 150 g per week15),
as  a  consequence  of  defining  categories  broadly  or
combining  them  to  provide  stable  estimates  in  the
analysis. In contrast, our analysis had the power to ex-
amine risks within five narrowly defined categories of
alcohol consumption, with four of them correspond-
ing to the beneficial part of the suggested associations.
With this approach, we found that alcohol had a ben-
eficial  effect  in  men  who  had  as  little  as  one  drink
per week, a finding that would have been masked if
we had used broader categories. The flat shape of the
association with total stroke also suggests that the na-
dir of the observed benefit is not a single category
of alcohol consumption but rather a range of con-
sumption from one to seven drinks per week.

Our study has a number of limitations. First, there
may have been some incorrect reports of alcohol con-
sumption by the participants at base line, leading to
a certain degree of misclassification of this variable.

However, since all information was assessed at base
line, before the occurrence of stroke, any misclassifi-
cation  due  to  an  incorrect  report  was  nondifferen-
tial.31 In addition, studies have shown that the reli-
ability  of  self-reported  alcohol  consumption  in  the
general population, including health care professionals,
is good32,33 and also that physicians accurately report
their  own  cardiovascular  risk  factors.28,34  Further-
more, both high-density lipoprotein (HDL) choles-
terol and blood pressure, measures known to be cor-
related with levels of alcohol use, had the expected
associations  with  the  reported  amounts  of  alcohol
consumption in the Physicians’ Health Study,27 pro-
viding further evidence of the reliability of self-report-
ing in this cohort.

Nonetheless, the possibility of systematic underre-
porting of alcohol consumption must be considered.
If it occurred, the observed association between al-
cohol use and reduced risk of stroke would be artifi-
cially shifted toward lower drinking categories, leading
to an erroneous, lower nadir for the relation between
alcohol intake and the risk of stroke. However, since
we observed a beneficial effect at a very low level of
alcohol intake (one drink a week), a slight shift of the
curve to the right would still reveal an effect over a
range of moderate levels of alcohol intake.

Misclassification due to a change in the level of al-
cohol  consumption  after  base  line  is  also  possible.
However, if there was such an effect in this cohort, it
was probably small, since we found a high correlation
between alcohol consumption at base line and at 84
months.

The use of persons who never drank as the refer-
ence group in epidemiologic studies of the health ef-
fects of alcohol consumption is often questioned, be-
cause some of these abstainers might have given up
drinking for reasons of health. However, the physi-

cians in our study reported at base line that they had
no history of myocardial infarction, transient ischemic
attack, or stroke and that they were free of active liv-
er disease and peptic ulcer, conditions that could lead
to abstention from drinking alcohol.

Finally, the questionnaire asked about the frequen-
cy  of  drinking,  but  the  participants  may  have  con-
sumed more than one drink on a particular occasion.
However,  since  the  nadir  of  the  risk  reduction  was
observed over a range of categories of moderate drink-
ing, rather than a single category, the shape of the as-
sociation would not be affected.

We could not assess the possibility of a differential
effect of specific types of alcohol on the risk of stroke,
as some studies have suggested,35,36 since the ques-
tionnaire did not ask about the type of beverage. We
also  had  no  information  about  drinking  patterns.
Since binge drinking may be a risk factor for stroke,
especially for hemorrhagic stroke in young adults,37-39
this risk could not be specified. However, since our co-
hort consisted of middle-aged and elderly men of high
socioeconomic status, a group with a low incidence of
binge drinking,40 any effect of such drinking would
probably have been small. Finally, the possibility of
residual confounding was substantially reduced by our
use of a cohort of physicians that was homogeneous
with respect to education and socioeconomic status.
The  effects  of  alcohol  on  the  body  are  complex
and involve a number of biologic mechanisms. Mod-
erate  alcohol  consumption  has  an  inverse  relation
with arteriosclerosis of the large arteries of the circle
of Willis and the carotid arteries41,42 but not with ar-
teriosclerosis of the small, intracerebral arteries.43 This
effect could be due to a reduction of Lp(a) lipopro-
tein, since Lp(a) lipoprotein levels are related to the
extent of carotid arteriosclerosis.44 Elevated levels of
Lp(a) lipoprotein are a risk factor for coronary heart
disease,45-47 have been found to be elevated in survi-
vors of stroke,48 and are reduced by alcohol intake.49
In addition, there is evidence that vascular endothe-
lial factors, especially nitric oxide, provide protection
against  atherosclerosis.50,51  In  experimental  studies,
the activity of nitric oxide at the vessel wall was en-
hanced  by  ethanol  through  the  induction  of  the
enzyme nitric oxide synthase.52 

Another  explanation  for  the  effect  of  alcohol  on
the risk of stroke is the finding that alcohol increases
HDL cholesterol levels,53,54 which are inversely relat-
ed to arteriosclerosis at many sites, including the ca-
rotid  arteries.41,55  HDL  cholesterol  levels  are  lower
in survivors of stroke than in controls.56-58 However,
changes in HDL cholesterol levels only partially ex-
plain the inverse relation between alcohol consump-
tion and death from cardiovascular causes.53 Further-
more,  a  recent  study6  suggested  that  the  observed
association between moderate alcohol consumption
and a reduced risk of stroke was independent of the
HDL cholesterol level.

These findings suggest that hemostasis plays a part
in the protective effect of alcohol on the risk of stroke.
Alcohol  alters  coagulation  in  a  number  of  ways.  It
reduces platelet aggregation59,60 by increasing the ra-
tio of prostacyclin to thromboxane,60 and it decreases
the  aggregation  and  increases  the  deformability  of
red cells.61 In addition, alcohol decreases the risk of
clotting by reducing fibrinogen levels and increasing
the levels of tissue plasminogen activator.62-64 The lat-
ter effect is paradoxical, since elevated levels of tissue
plasminogen activator are correlated with an increased
risk of ischemic stroke,65 yet alcohol consumption, al-
though it reduces the risk of stroke, is associated with
increased plasma levels of tissue plasminogen activa-
tor.63 Although elevated levels of tissue plasminogen
activator  increase  the  risk  of  ischemic  stroke,  with
moderate alcohol use the deleterious effect of tissue
plasminogen activator is probably outweighed by the
other  beneficial  effects  of  alcohol  on  HDL  choles-
terol, Lp(a) lipoprotein, platelet aggregation, and fi-
brinogen, resulting in a net benefit of alcohol use.
Thus, the relative magnitude of the effect of the in-
dividual factors, both positive and negative, and their
interplay  probably  determine  the  ultimate  effect  of
alcohol on the risk of stroke.

In summary, light-to-moderate consumption of al-
cohol (one to seven drinks per week) reduced the risks
of total stroke and of ischemic stroke in a cohort of
healthy,  predominantly  white  physicians.  Although
this finding may be important for persons who con-
sume alcoholic beverages with low or moderate fre-
quency,  no  generalizations  about  the  benefits  of  a
change  in  lifestyle  should  be  drawn  from  the  ob-
servation. The risk reduction associated with such a
change  is  clearly  smaller  than  that  associated  with
medical interventions, such as treatment for hyperten-
sion. Moreover, aside from the serious morbidity and
social  problems  related  to  alcohol  use,  it  has  been
shown that in a large population, any increase in al-
cohol consumption is associated with a proportion-
ate increase in heavy drinking.66 Heavy drinking is a
risk factor for hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke,3,6,17
as  well  as  for  morbidity  and  mortality  from  other
causes; therefore, in the words of Marmot and Brun-
ner,  “Any  public  health  recommendation  that  em-
phasizes  the  positive  aspects  of  alcohol  would  be
likely . . . to do more harm than good.”22
