Background: The Mediterranean diet has been shown to have
beneficial effects on cardiovascular risk factors.

Objective: To compare the short-term effects of 2 Mediterranean
diets versus those of a low-fat diet on intermediate markers of
cardiovascular risk.

Design: Substudy of a multicenter, randomized, primary prevention
trial of cardiovascular disease (Prevencio´ n con Dieta Mediterra´ nea
[PREDIMED] Study).

Setting: Primary care centers affiliated with 10 teaching hospitals.

Participants: 772 asymptomatic persons 55 to 80 years of age at
high cardiovascular risk who were recruited from October 2003 to
March 2004.

Interventions: Participants were assigned to a low-fat diet (n ⫽
257) or to 1 of 2 Mediterranean diets. Those allocated to Medi-
terranean diets received nutritional education and either free virgin
olive oil, 1 liter per week (n ⫽ 257), or free nuts, 30 g/d (n ⫽ 258).
The authors evaluated outcome changes at 3 months.

Measurements: Body weight, blood pressure, lipid profile, glucose
levels, and inflammatory molecules.

Results: The completion rate was 99.6%. Compared with the
low-fat diet, the 2 Mediterranean diets produced beneficial changes

in most outcomes. Compared with the low-fat diet, the mean
changes in the Mediterranean diet with olive oil group and the
Mediterranean diet with nuts group were ⫺0.39 mmol/L (95% CI,
⫺0.70 to ⫺ 0.07 mmol/L) and ⫺ 0.30 mmol/L (CI, ⫺0.58
to ⫺ 0.01 mmol/L), respectively, for plasma glucose levels; ⫺5.9

and ⫺ 0.26 (CI, ⫺0.42
to ⫺0.10), respectively, for the cholesterol–high-density lipoprotein
cholesterol ratio. The Mediterranean diet with olive oil reduced
C-reactive protein levels by 0.54 mg/L (CI, 1.04 to 0.03 mg/L)
compared with the low-fat diet.

respectively,

Limitations: This short-term study did not focus on clinical out-
comes. Nutritional education about low-fat diet was less intense
than education about Mediterranean diets.

Conclusion: Compared with a low-fat diet, Mediterranean diets
supplemented with olive oil or nuts have beneficial effects on
cardiovascular risk factors.

industrialized countries, but

Cardiovascular disease is the main cause of death in

incidence rates have
marked geographic differences. The low incidence of cor-
onary heart disease (CHD) in Mediterranean countries has
been partly ascribed to dietary habits (1–3). Recent ﬁnd-
ings from large European cohort studies (4 – 6) suggest that
a high degree of adherence to the Mediterranean diet is
associated with a reduction in mortality. In small clinical
studies, the Mediterranean diet or some of its components
have reduced blood pressure (7) and have improved lipid
proﬁles (8, 9) and endothelial function (10). Moreover, a
recent cross-sectional study (11) and a 2-year feeding trial
(12) have shown that adherence to the Mediterranean diet
is associated with reduced markers of vascular inﬂamma-
tion. These beneﬁcial effects on surrogate markers of car-
diovascular risk add biological plausibility to the epidemi-
ologic evidence that supports a protective effect of the
Mediterranean diet.

Olive oil, a rich source of monounsaturated fatty acids,
is a main component of the Mediterranean diet. Virgin
olive oil retains all the lipophilic components of the fruit,
␣-tocopherol, and phenolic compounds with strong anti-
oxidant and anti-inﬂammatory properties (13, 14). Tree

nuts, which are also typical in the Mediterranean diet, have
a favorable fatty acid proﬁle and are a rich source of nutri-
ents and other bioactive compounds that may beneﬁcially
inﬂuence the risk for CHD, such as ﬁber, phytosterols,
folic acid, and antioxidants (15). Frequent nut intake has
been associated with decreased CHD rates in prospective
studies (15). Walnuts differ from all other nuts through
their high content of polyunsaturated fatty acids, particu-
larly ␣-linolenic acid, a plant n-3 fatty acid (16), which
may confer additional antiatherogenic properties (17).
Therefore, we designed a large-scale feeding trial in high-

Context
Some experts attribute a low incidence of heart disease in
Mediterranean countries to dietary habits.

Contribution
In this multicenter, 3-group trial, investigators randomly
assigned 772 adults at high risk for cardiovascular disease
to a low-fat diet or to a Mediterranean diet supplemented
with either virgin olive oil (1 L per week) or nuts (30 g per
day). After 3 months, the Mediterranean diet groups had
lower mean plasma glucose level, systolic blood pressure,
and total cholesterol– high-density lipoprotein cholesterol
ratio than the low-fat diet group.

Cautions
The Mediterranean diet groups received more nutritional
education than the low-fat diet group.

Implications
Mediterranean diets supplemented with olive oil or nuts
may improve cardiovascular risk factors.

risk participants to assess the effects of 2 Mediterranean
diets, one supplemented with virgin olive oil and the other
supplemented with mixed nuts, compared with a low-fat
diet on cardiovascular outcomes. We report the results of a
3-month intervention on intermediate markers of cardio-
vascular risk in the ﬁrst 772 participants who were re-
cruited into the trial.

METHODS
Study Design

The Prevencio´n con Dieta Mediterra´nea (PREDIMED)
Study is a large, parallel-group, multicenter, randomized,
controlled, 4-year clinical trial that aims to assess the effects
of the Mediterranean diet on the primary prevention of
cardiovascular disease (www.predimed.org). An estimated
9000 high-risk participants (⬎5000 participants are al-
ready recruited) will be assigned to 3 interventions: Medi-
terranean diet with virgin olive oil, Mediterranean diet
with mixed nuts, or low-fat diet. The main outcome is an
aggregate of cardiovascular events (cardiovascular death,
nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke). The
anticipated completion date of the trial is December 2010.
We designed our present study to assess the 3-month
effects of the dietary interventions on surrogate markers of
cardiovascular risk in participants entering the study dur-
ing the ﬁrst 6 months of recruitment. The institutional
review boards of the 10 participating centers approved the
study protocol.
Participants and Recruitment

From October 2003 to March 2004, we selected 930
potential participants in primary care centers afﬁliated with

2 4 July 2006 Annals of Internal Medicine Volume 145 (cid:127) Number 1

10 teaching hospitals across Spain. Eligible participants
were community-dwelling men, 55 to 80 years of age, and
women, 60 to 80 years of age, who fulﬁlled at least 1 of 2
criteria: type 2 diabetes or 3 or more CHD risk factors
(current smoking, hypertension [blood pressure ⬎140/90
mm Hg or treatment with antihypertensive drugs], low-
density lipoprotein [LDL] cholesterol level ⱖ4.14 mmol/L
[ⱖ160 mg/dL] [or treatment with hypolipidemic drugs],
level ⱕ1.04
high-density lipoprotein [HDL] cholesterol
mmol/L [ⱕ40 mg/dL], body mass index [BMI] ⱖ25 kg/
m2, or a family history of premature CHD). Exclusion
criteria were history of cardiovascular disease, any severe
chronic illness, drug or alcohol addiction, history of allergy
or intolerance to olive oil or nuts, or low predicted likeli-
hood of changing dietary habits according to the stages-of-
change model (18).

The primary care physicians based participants’ eligi-
bility on review of clinical records and a screening visit.
They obtained a list of candidates from computer-based
records of patients who attended each participating center
and reviewed their clinical records to exclude those who
did not meet eligibility criteria. They then invited suitable
candidates by telephone to attend a screening visit. The
visit included an interview with administration of a 26-
item questionnaire to inquire about medical conditions
and risk factors related to eligibility. Of the eligible candi-
dates who met entry requirements, 95% agreed to partici-
pate and provided informed consent.

Randomization and Intervention

After the screening visit, each center randomly as-
signed eligible participants to 1 of 3 diet groups by using a
computer-generated random-number sequence. The coor-
dinating center constructed the randomization table, and
participants were randomly assigned into blocks of 50 par-
ticipants balanced by center, sex, and age group (⬍70 years
and ⱖ70 years). We concealed allocation into the interven-
tion groups by using closed envelopes with correlative
numbers by prespeciﬁed subgroups of sex and age.

The baseline examination included the administration
of a 14-item questionnaire, an extension of a previously
validated questionnaire (19), that assessed the degree of
adherence to the traditional Mediterranean diet. We as-
signed values of 0 or 1 to each item (Appendix Table 1,
available at www.annals.org). We also administered a 137-
item validated food frequency questionnaire (20); the val-
idated Spanish version (21) of the Minnesota Leisure Time
Physical Activity Questionnaire; and a 47-item question-
naire about education, lifestyle, history of illnesses, and
medication use. We performed anthropometric and blood
pressure measurements and obtained samples of fasting
blood and spot urine. We repeated all examinations at 3
months.

The same dietitian delivered the interventions to the 3
randomized groups in each center. On the basis of the
assessment of individual Mediterranean diet scores, the di-

www.annals.org

etitian gave personalized dietary advice during a 30-minute
session to each participant, with recommendations on the
desired frequency of intake of speciﬁc foods. We advised
participants who were allocated to the low-fat diet to re-
duce intake of all types of fat, and we gave them a leaﬂet
with written recommendations according to the American
Heart Association guidelines (22). For total fat intake,
these recommendations were opposite to those given to
participants in the 2 Mediterranean diet groups, who re-
ceived instructions intended to increase the 14-item Med-
iterranean diet score, including increased consumption of
vegetable fats and oils. We did not suggest any energy
restriction.

While the participants who were allocated to the low-
fat diet did not receive further intervention, those assigned
the 2 Mediterranean diet groups had access to more intense
intervention in 2 ways. First, they were given a free provi-
sion of typical Mediterranean fatty foods (olive oil or nuts).
Depending on group assignment, participants were given
either free virgin olive oil (15 L [1 L/wk] for 3 months) or
free sachets of walnuts, hazelnuts, and almonds (1350 g of
walnuts [15 g/d], 675 g of hazelnuts [7.5 g/d], and 675 g
of almonds [7.5 g/d] for 3 months). To improve adherence
and account for family needs, participants in the corre-
sponding Mediterranean diet groups were given excess ol-
ive oil or additional 1000-g packets of nuts. We analyzed
the nutrient composition of the olive oil and nuts used in

the study by standard methods in a reference laboratory
(Appendix Table 2, available at www.annals.org). Second,
1 week after inclusion, the dietitian delivered a 1-hour
group session with up to 20 participants, with separate
sessions for each Mediterranean diet group. Each group
session consisted of informative talks and provision of writ-
ten materials with elaborate descriptions of typical Medi-
terranean foods and seasonal shopping lists, meal plans,
and cooking recipes. Throughout the study, all participants
had free and continuous access to their center dietitian for
advice and consultation.

Measurements

(Omron HEM-705CP, Hoofddorp,

Trained personnel measured weight and height by us-
ing calibrated scales and a wall-mounted stadiometer, re-
spectively; waist circumference midway between the lowest

from Spanish food composition tables
the
3-month visit and when consulted by participants, dieti-
tians assessed any adverse effects from the interventions by
administering a checklist of symptoms and gave advice on
how to remedy them. The checklist included mouth symp-
toms; bloating, fullness, or indigestion; altered bowel habit;
and any other diet-related symptom.

Samples of serum, EDTA plasma, and urine were
coded, were shipped to central
laboratories, and were
stored at ⫺80 °C until assay. The clinical investigators and
laboratory technicians were blinded to the interventions.
Analytes determined for each participant in frozen samples
of whole serum or plasma as appropriate were blood glu-
cose level by the glucose– oxidase method; serum insulin
level by radioimmunoassay; cholesterol and triglyceride
levels by enzymatic procedures; HDL cholesterol level after
precipitation with phosphotungstic acid and magnesium
chloride; apolipoproteins A1 and B levels by using turbi-
dimetry; soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-
1), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), and in-
terleukin-6 levels by standard enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assays; and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP) level
by particle-enhanced immunonephelometry. We per-
formed all analyses in duplicate. Intra- and interassay vari-
ation coefﬁcients for insulin, CRP, ICAM-1, VCAM-1,
and interleukin-6 ranged from 1.8% to 5.4% and from
0.9% to 9.9%, respectively.

intake (25) and the ␣-linolenic acid plasma content by gas
chromatography as a measure of adherence to nut (walnut)
intake (8).

Statistical Analyses

For a parallel design, statistical power calculations in-
dicated that 227 participants per group would be needed to
detect mean differences of 0.13 mmol/L (SD, 0.49) (5
mg/dL [SD, 19]) in LDL cholesterol level (8) (␣⫽ 0.05;
power ⫽ 0.8). Although we used LDL cholesterol level to
set sample size, we were equally interested in changes in all
end points in our exploratory and nonconﬁrmatory study.
We based the analysis on the intention-to-treat principle.
We used descriptive statistics with means and SDs for the
baseline characteristics of the participants. For analysis of
laboratory variables, we used the average of 2 baseline mea-
sures as the baseline value and the average of the 2 mea-
sures taken after the 3-month intervention as the ﬁnal vari-
able. We transformed values with a skewed distribution
(CRP, VCAM-1, ICAM-1, and interleukin-6) to their nat-
ural
logarithm for analyses. We examined 3-month
changes in clinical, dietary, and laboratory variables, in-
cluding center, as a stratiﬁcation factor in the multivariable
model. We controlled potential confounding by age, sex,
and baseline body weight, entering these variables also into
the multivariable model. We excluded participants whose
energy intake, as derived from the food frequency ques-

www.annals.org

tionnaires, was outside prespeciﬁed ranges (500 kcal/d to
3500 kcal/d for women and 800 kcal/d to 4000 kcal/d for
men) (26) from the calculations of food, energy, and nu-
trient intake. In addition, we excluded participants with
plasma CRP levels greater than 10 mg/L at any measure-
ment, indicating an inﬂammatory process, from statistical
analyses of inﬂammatory biomarkers. Within- and be-
tween-group differences are expressed as means and 95%
CIs. All statistical tests were 2-tailed, and the signiﬁcance
level was 0.05. We performed analyses by using SPSS, ver-
sion 11.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Illinois).
Role of the Funding Sources

This study was supported by a grant from the Spanish
Ministry of Health (Red G03/140). Fundacio´n Patrimonio
Comunal Olivarero and Hojiblanca SA, the California
Walnut Commission, Borges SA, and Morella Nuts SA
generously donated the olive oil, walnuts, almonds, and
hazelnuts, respectively, used in the study. The funding
sources had no role in the design, collection, analysis, or
interpretation of the data or in the decision to submit the
manuscript for publication.

RESULTS

We excluded 158 of 930 eligible participants before
randomization for various reasons (Figure 1). Table 1
shows the baseline characteristics of the 772 participants
who entered the study. Of these participants, 697 were
Europeans of Spanish descent and 75 were Hispanic im-
migrants from Central and South America. Although the
trial is an ongoing, large multicenter trial with large block

sizes, the groups were balanced in ethnic origin, demo-
graphic characteristics, adiposity, and risk factors. Three
participants withdrew before study completion; their base-
line characteristics were similar to those of the overall
group.
Adverse Effects

Thirty-four (13%) participants in the Mediterranean
diet with nuts group had difﬁculty chewing whole nuts or
reported that small fragments of nuts were lodged between
their teeth. This problem was solved satisfactorily by the
advice to consume the nuts crushed and mixed with low-
fat yogurt, except for 1 participant who withdrew from the
study. Participants who were allocated to the Mediterra-
nean diet with olive oil group or to the low-fat diet group
reported no adverse effects.
Food, Energy, and Nutrient Intake

We excluded the following participants from food, en-
ergy, and nutrient calculations because they reported unre-
alistic energy intakes: 21 in the Mediterranean diet plus
olive oil group, 19 in the Mediterranean diet plus nuts
group, and 8 in the low-fat diet group (26). The main
dietary changes were the large increases in consumption of
virgin olive oil and nuts in the corresponding Mediterra-
nean diet groups that were provided with these foods. Re-
ciprocal decreases in the consumption of common olive oil
indicated that participants replaced this oil by the virgin
variety supplied. Both olive oil and nut intake decreased
nonsigniﬁcantly in the low-fat group. Participants in the 3
groups increased the intake of vegetables, legumes, fruit,
and ﬁsh and decreased the intake of meat, sweets, and dairy

creased in the 2 Mediterranean diet groups and remained
unchanged in the low-fat group. The results did not
change when we included the participants whose energy
consumption was out of range in the calculations.

Estimated energy expenditure from physical activity
was similar in the 3 groups at baseline and after 3 months
(data not shown). We observed a reduction from baseline
in reported energy intake in the groups allocated to the
Mediterranean diet plus olive oil and low-fat diets (Table

baseline; the 2 Mediterranean diet groups reduced choles-
terol intake; and the Mediterranean diet with nuts group
decreased the intake of total carbohydrate and increased
the intake of ﬁber, total fat, monounsaturated fatty acids,
and polyunsaturated fatty acids.

Biochemical measurements in plasma and urine sam-
ples from a random group of 273 (35%) participants in the
study showed good adherence to supplemental foods in the
Mediterranean diet groups. Compared with the low-fat
diet group, participants assigned to the Mediterranean diet
with olive oil group showed an increase from baseline in
urinary tyrosol levels of 19 ng/mL (95% CI, 5 to 35 ng/
mL) and in hydroxytyrosol levels of 84 ng/mL (CI, 34 to
135 ng/mL); those allocated to the Mediterranean diet
with nuts group showed an increase in plasma ␣-linolenic
acid level of 0.15 mol% (CI, 0.09 to 0.21 mol%).
Cardiovascular Risk Factors

Table 4 shows the changes in cardiovascular risk fac-
tors. Body weight and adiposity measures were slightly re-
duced in the 3 groups, with no between-group differences
and statistically signiﬁcant within-group changes only for
BMI in the low-fat group. Compared with participants
assigned to the low-fat diet group, those in the 2 Mediter-
ranean diet groups had decreased systolic and diastolic

blood pressure, blood glucose levels, and cholesterol–HDL
cholesterol ratio and increased HDL cholesterol
levels.
Fasting insulin levels and homeostasis model assessment
scores were also lower in participants without diabetes in
the 2 Mediterranean diet groups. Total cholesterol and
triglyceride levels decreased only in the Mediterranean diet
with nuts group.
Inflammatory Markers

We excluded from calculations 8 participants in the
Mediterranean diet plus olive oil group, 2 participants in
the Mediterranean diet plus nuts group, and 4 participants
in the low-fat diet group who had plasma CRP levels
greater than 10 mg/L in at least 1 measurement. Figure 2
shows the changes from baseline values in CRP, interleu-
kin-6, ICAM-1, and VCAM-1 concentrations in the 3
groups. The CRP concentration decreased only in partici-
pants who were allocated to the Mediterranean diet plus
olive oil group. Compared with participants in the low-fat
diet group, adjusted between-group changes in CRP levels
were ⫺0.54 mg/L (CI, ⫺1.04 to ⫺0.03 mg/L) for those in
the Mediterranean diet with olive oil group and 0.33 mg/L
(CI, ⫺0.19 to 0.84 mg/L) for those in the Mediterranean
diet with nuts group. Circulating interleukin-6, ICAM-1,
and VCAM-1 concentrations decreased in both Mediterra-
nean diet groups and increased in the low-fat diet group.
Compared with the low-fat diet group, the between-group
changes in interleukin-6 level were ⫺1.6 ng/L (CI, ⫺2.5
to ⫺0.6 ng/L) for the Mediterranean diet with olive oil
group and ⫺1.3 ng/L (CI, ⫺2.3 to ⫺0.4 ng/L) for the
Mediterranean diet with nuts group. The between-group
changes in ICAM-1 level were ⫺104 ng/mL (CI, ⫺135
to ⫺72 ng/mL) and ⫺97 ng/mL (CI, ⫺128 to ⫺65 ng/
mL), respectively; the between-group changes in VCAM-1
level were ⫺178 ng/mL (CI, ⫺277 to ⫺79 ng/mL) and
⫺167 ng/mL (CI, ⫺267 to ⫺68 ng/mL), respectively. Be-

tistical signiﬁcance was unchanged when we included partici-
pants with CRP levels greater
than 10 mg/L in the
calculations. This did not affect the results of the other inﬂam-
matory molecules.

Subgroup Analyses

We observed no differences in outcomes for any study
group in subgroups deﬁned by center, ethnic origin, sex,
age, baseline weight, or physical activity. However, partic-
ipants with hypertension showed statistically signiﬁcantly
higher reductions from baseline in systolic blood pressure
when given each of the 2 Mediterranean diets, with mean
changes of ⫺6.2 mm Hg (CI, ⫺8.4 to ⫺4.0 mm Hg) for
olive oil and ⫺7.4 mm Hg (CI, ⫺9.9 to ⫺5.0 mm Hg)
for nuts. Participants with hypertension in the low-fat diet
group showed a mean change in systolic blood pressure of
1.2 mm Hg (CI, ⫺1.0 to 3.4 mm Hg). Participants with
normal blood pressure in the low-fat diet, Mediterranean
diet with olive oil, and Mediterranean diet with nuts
groups showed mean changes in systolic blood pressure
of ⫺1.8 mm Hg (CI, ⫺6.7 to 3.0 mm Hg), 0.5 mm Hg
(CI, ⫺1.4 to 2.5 mm Hg), and ⫺2.2 mm Hg (CI, ⫺4.5 to
0.1 mm Hg), respectively. Changes in diastolic blood pres-
sure according to blood pressure status followed a similar
pattern (data not shown).

DISCUSSION

If the Mediterranean diet was useful in primary car-
diovascular prevention, one would expect that persons who
adhere to the diet show a reduction in risk factors for
atherosclerosis. In our study, high-risk participants who
improved their baseline Mediterranean diet after nutri-
tional education and supplementation with virgin olive oil
or mixed nuts showed lower blood pressure,
improved
lipid proﬁles, decreased insulin resistance, and reduced
concentrations of inﬂammatory molecules compared with
those allocated to a low-fat diet.

The Mediterranean diet

is high-fat because large
amounts of monounsaturated fatty acid–rich olive oil are
used in Mediterranean cultures (27, 28). Scientiﬁc evi-
dence has documented the beneﬁcial effect of diets with a
relatively high monounsaturated fatty acid content on car-
diovascular risk factors, obesity, and diabetes (1, 28 –31)
(Appendix Table 3, available at www.annals.org). How-
ever, when nutritional advice is given to people with in-
creased adiposity, clinicians are still reluctant to recom-
mend high-fat, high–monounsaturated fatty acid diets as
an alternative to the traditional (and less palatable) low-fat
diets because of the belief that fat provides excess energy,
thus promoting obesity. Because many participants in our
study were obese or had diabetes, our results are reassuring

in the lack of weight gain when supplementing ad libitum
diets with sizable amounts of unsaturated fats, such as
those contained in olive oil or nuts. Our results also add to
the increasing evidence that diets enriched with nuts do
not induce weight gain (32–34).

Healthy diet and lifestyle are critical for preventing
and treating hypertension (35). In our study, both Medi-
terranean diets were associated with statistically signiﬁcant
reductions in blood pressure in participants with hyperten-
sion who were already receiving antihypertensive medica-
tion. Observational studies (36, 37) and small feeding trials
(38, 39) have suggested that increased olive oil consump-
tion helps lower blood pressure (40). Recently, the Omni-
Heart study (41) also reported that diets rich in monoun-
saturated fatty acids
sources exerted an
antihypertensive effect. No effects on blood pressure have
been reported for diets enriched with nuts in small trials
(15). However, walnuts seem to have favorable effects on
vasomotor activity (42). Furthermore, the intake of ␣-lin-
olenic acid, the plant n-3 fatty acid that is abundant in

from various

8 4 July 2006 Annals of Internal Medicine Volume 145 (cid:127) Number 1

walnuts, was inversely related to blood pressure in a large
cross-sectional study (43). Participants following the Med-
iterranean diet with nuts increased ␣-linolenic acid intake
by an average of 1 g/d; thus, walnut consumption may
have helped lower blood pressure. Another explanation for
the blood pressure reduction observed with the 2 Mediter-
ranean diet groups is the change in the overall food pat-
tern, which was similar to that advocated in the Dietary
Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) trial (44), with
the exception of the high content of olive oil. Salt intake
was not restricted in our study. The blood pressure–lower-
ing effect of the Mediterranean diets was similar to that of
the unrestricted-sodium DASH diets (44) and was less
than that of the low-sodium DASH diet (45). The effect
was greater, however, than that obtained by partial substi-
tution of carbohydrates with monounsaturated fatty acids
in the OmniHeart study (41).

The 2 Mediterranean diets were associated with lower
fasting glucose levels in all participants and lower fasting
insulin levels and insulin resistance in those without diabe-

tes, thus extending previous observations of the favorable
effects of Mediterranean diets on insulin sensitivity in pa-
tients with the metabolic syndrome (12). Insulin resistance
and diabetes are linked to excess energy intake, particularly
in the form of saturated fatty acids and simple sugars, and
to increased adiposity (46). Low-fat, high-carbohydrate di-
ets have traditionally been advised for patients with diabe-
tes. However, such diets may worsen metabolic control, an
untoward effect that is not observed with high-fat diets
based on monounsaturated fatty acid–rich oils or nuts
(31). Frequent nut consumption has been inversely associ-
ated with diabetes risk (47). In addition, decreased intake
of meat and dairy products and increased ﬁber intake, as
observed in the 2 Mediterranean diet groups, have been
shown to reduce the incidence of diabetes in conjunction
with lifestyle interventions (48, 49). Our results further
support a beneﬁcial effect of healthy diets on insulin resis-
tance.

Replacing carbohydrate with dietary fat lowers triglyc-
eride levels and increases HDL cholesterol
levels, while
substituting monounsaturated fatty acids for saturated fatty
acids lowers LDL cholesterol levels (50, 51). Total fat in-
take was high both at baseline and after 3 months, and we
observed a similar reduction in saturated fatty acid intake
of approximately 1% of energy in the 3 groups. However,
the lipid proﬁle did not change in the low-fat diet group,
while HDL cholesterol levels increased in the 2 Mediterra-
nean diet groups, especially when olive oil was supple-
mented. While diets enriched with various nuts have an
established hypocholesterolemic effect (8, 15, 42), why
substituting virgin olive oil for reﬁned olive oil has such
beneﬁcial lipid effects is unknown. Minor olive oil constit-
uents contained in virgin olive oils (13, 14) might explain
these effects and merit further study. Since low-fat diets
usually lower both LDL cholesterol and HDL cholesterol
concentrations (52–54), a fat-rich Mediterranean diet may
be a better nutritional option for high-risk individuals.

Nut consumption in small trials has not resulted in
lower serum triglyceride levels (15). The triglyceride-low-
ering effect observed in participants in the Mediterranean
diet with nuts group might be related to the increased
intake of ␣-linolenic acid from walnuts, since ␣-linolenic
acid consumption was inversely related to triglyceride con-
centrations in a cross-sectional study (55).

Atherosclerosis is widely viewed as an inﬂammatory
disease (56). Epidemiologic, clinical, and experimental
studies have shown that the Mediterranean diet (10 –12) or
the frequent consumption of several main components of
this dietary pattern, such as olive oil (14, 57), nuts (34,
42), or red wine (57, 58), is associated with a lower inﬂam-
matory status and improved endothelial function. Similar
ﬁndings have been reported recently for other healthy di-
etary patterns (59). We observed reduced concentrations of
cell adhesion molecules in participants assigned to the 2
Mediterranean diet groups, supporting the anti-inﬂamma-
tory effects of this dietary pattern.

Our study has some limitations. Ensuring adherence
to dietary instructions is difﬁcult in a feeding trial. How-
ever, adherence to recommended dietary patterns and sup-
plemental foods was good, as judged by self-report and
objective measurements. On the other hand, our design
has the strength of reproducing real-life conditions with
home-prepared foods, reﬂecting usual practice. A second
limitation is that nutritional education about low-fat diet
was less intense than education about Mediterranean diets.
In fact, fat intake was only marginally reduced in the group
assigned to the low-fat diet. This was partly because of the
study design but also because participants belonged to a
Mediterranean culture, where people prefer using olive oil.
Because the low-fat diet was not the usual diet, participants
in this group also changed food habits in a healthy way.
Therefore, the differences in outcomes observed between
the Mediterranean diet groups and the low-fat diet group
might be attributed to the supplemental foods provided.
The duration of follow-up of only 3 months cannot be
considered a major limitation because effects of dietary in-
terventions on risk factors do not need a long induction
period (44, 45, 53) and seem to persist as long as adher-
ence is maintained (12, 48, 49).

In conclusion, our results suggest that the healthy ef-
fects of the Mediterranean diet observed in epidemiologic
studies are exerted partly through plausible mechanisms:
improved lipid proﬁles and reductions in blood pressure,
insulin resistance, and systemic markers of inﬂammation.
Our study duration was far too short to deal with clinical
outcomes. Longer follow-up of the whole PREDIMED
trial will eventually provide stronger evidence. In the
meantime, an increasing body of knowledge supports the
Mediterranean diet as a useful tool in managing individuals
who are at high risk for CHD.

* With the exception of 2 widely cited Italian papers from the 1980s (38, 70), which were not randomized, we included only randomized feeding trials with intermediate
outcomes in which 1 diet was a Mediterranean diet containing at least 15% energy as MUFA derived in part from olive oil. BMI ⫽ body mass index; BP ⫽ blood pressure;
CHD ⫽ coronary heart disease; CRP ⫽ C-reactive protein; HDL ⫽ high-density lipoprotein; LDL ⫽ low-density lipoprotein; MUFA ⫽ monounsaturated fatty acid;
VCAM-1 ⫽ vascular cell adhesion molecule-1; VLDL ⫽ very-low-density lipoprotein.
