Controlled Trials

PURPOSE: Observational studies have shown an inconsistent
association between n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and the risk
of coronary heart disease. We investigated the effects of dietary
and nondietary (supplemental) intake of n-3 polyunsaturated
fatty acids on coronary heart disease.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We searched the literature to
identify randomized controlled trials that compared dietary or
nondietary intake of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids with a con-
trol diet or placebo in patients with coronary heart disease.
Studies had to have at least 6 months of follow-up data, and to
have reported clinical endpoint data. We identiﬁed 11 trials,
published between 1966 and 1999, which included 7951 pa-
tients in the intervention and 7855 patients in the control
groups.
RESULTS: The risk ratio of nonfatal myocardial infarction in
patients who were on n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid-enriched

diets compared with control diets or placebo was 0.8 (95% con-
ﬁdence interval [CI]: 0.5 to 1.2, P ⫽ 0.16; Breslow-Day test for
heterogeneity, P ⫽ 0.01), and the risk ratio of fatal myocardial
infarction was 0.7 (95% CI: 0.6 to 0.8, P ⬍0.001; heterogeneity
P ⬎0.20). In 5 trials, sudden death was associated with a risk
ratio of 0.7 (95% CI: 0.6 to 0.9, P ⬍0.01; heterogeneity P ⬎0.20),
whereas the risk ratio of overall mortality was 0.8 (95% CI: 0.7 to
0.9, P ⬍0.001; heterogeneity P ⬎0.20). There was no difference
in summary estimates between dietary and nondietary inter-
ventions of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids for all endpoints.
CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis suggests that dietary and
nondietary intake of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids reduces
overall mortality, mortality due to myocardial infarction, and
sudden death in patients with coronary heart disease. Am J

An inverse relation between the intake of n-3 polyunsat-
urated fatty acids, mainly from ﬁsh, and mortality due to
coronary heart disease, has been reported in several (1,2)
but not all prospective studies (3,4). The protective effect
of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids has been attributed to
eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexanoic acid, which
are present in ﬁsh oil, and alpha-linolenic acid, which is
present predominantly in soybean, ﬂaxseed, and canola
oils. N-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids reduce the incidence
of coronary heart disease by several mechanisms. Studies
have reported a dose-dependent effect on blood pressure
(5); however, these ﬁndings were not conﬁrmed in larger
trials (6,7). N-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids reduce plate-
let adherence and enhance endothelium-dependent va-

sodilatation (8 –10). There is evidence from clinical trials
(11,12) and animal studies (13) that n-3 polyunsaturated
fatty acids may also protect against ventricular arrhyth-
mia (12). These mechanisms may be important in reduc-
ing the incidence of coronary events in people with un-
derlying atherosclerosis.

Results from an earlier meta-analysis suggested that
n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids reduce the incidence of
restenosis in patients undergoing percutaneous translu-
minal coronary angioplasty (14), contrary to ﬁndings
from a larger trial (15). We therefore reviewed random-
ized controlled trials to investigate the effect of dietary or
supplemental intake of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids
on fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarction and overall
mortality.

placebo or a control diet. We combined the terms omega
3 fatty acids, ﬁsh oils, diet, dietary therapy, and cardiovas-
cular disease with text searches using the terms random
or control. We also searched the Cochrane Library and
references of relevant publications for additional trials.

Study Selection and Data Abstraction
We included studies based on the following criteria. First,
trials had to be randomized and to have compared dietary
or supplemental intake of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids
with a control diet or placebo. Second, trials had to report
fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction and overall mor-
tality. Trials with angiographic primary endpoints were
eligible if they reported myocardial infarction and mor-
tality data. Third, we only considered trials that followed
patients who had either myocardial infarction or angio-
graphically established coronary heart disease for at least
6 months. We excluded studies of restricted patients who
had undergone coronary bypass surgery or heart trans-
plantation.

Study eligibility and quality were determined via
blinded assessment by two pairs of investigators. Dis-
agreements were resolved by consensus. We assessed the
quality of included trials using a modiﬁed score that com-
prised the following (16): randomization of participants;
blinding of patients, caregivers, and those assessing out-
come; and complete description of subjects who with-
drew or dropped out. The scoring system gave 1 point to
each item, if present. If randomization was concealed
(central allocation), and if double blinding was con-
ducted with an identical placebo, the study received an-
other point, thus yielding a total score of 0 to 5 points.
Agreement for eligibility (kappa [␬] ⫽ 0.66) and trial
quality (␬⫽ 0.58) was good.

Statistical Analysis
We assessed publication bias by inspecting funnel plots
(graphs of the sample size of each trial and the pooled
summary estimates for different outcomes). We pooled
data from each trial using a ﬁxed-effects model (17), and
used a random-effects model if the Breslow-Day test for
heterogeneity (18) yielded a P value ⬍0.10.

To explore variability (heterogeneity) of study results,
we examined the magnitude of the treatment effects
in relation to the type of intervention (supplemental ver-
sus dietary intake), the duration of the intervention
(mean follow-up ⱖ12 months), and whether patients,
caregivers, and outcome assessors were blinded to alloca-
tion (19). We tested the differences in combined esti-
mates of subgroups, and used the z score for each sub-
group by dividing the difference in the log relative risk of
the subgroup summary by the standard error of the dif-
ference. All analyses were performed using SAS software
version 6.12 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, North Carolina).

RESULTS

Our literature search identiﬁed 406 studies, and 369 ad-
ditional articles were reviewed in the Cochrane Library.
We identiﬁed 177 trials, and excluded 129 that were not
related to coronary heart disease, 26 that had a follow-up
of less than 6 months or did not report clinical endpoint
data, and 7 that were duplicate publications. Four studies
included patients who had undergone heart transplanta-
tion or bypass surgery, and were therefore also excluded.
Eleven trials fulﬁlled our inclusion criteria: 2 of dietary
intervention (20,21) and 9 of supplementation with n-3
polyunsaturated fatty acids (15,22–29). There were 7951
patients in the intervention groups and 7855 patients in
the control groups (Table 1). In trials of supplementation
with n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, the dose for eicosa-
pentaenoic acid varied from 0.3 to 6.0 g, whereas the dose
for docosahexanoic acid ranged from 0.6 to 3.7 g. Only
one trial involved patients who had peripheral arterial
disease or coronary heart disease (26). Between 33% and
100% of the patients had a previous myocardial infarc-
tion. The mean age was 49 to 66 years, and the average
follow-up lasted 20 months (range, 6 to 46 months). At
enrollment, mean total cholesterol levels in study groups
were 4.8 to 6.5 mmol/L, mean low-density lipoprotein
(LDL) cholesterol levels were 2.8 to 4.5 mmol/L, and
mean triglyceride levels were 1.5 to 2.4 mmol/L. In the
intervention groups, the changes in mean total choles-
terol levels varied from ⫺8.8% to 6.0%; changes were
between ⫺10.9% and 8.8% for LDL cholesterol levels,
and between ⫺3.6% and ⫺40.4% for triglyceride levels.
Quality scores ranged from 2 to 5. The open trial design
(20,21,23,29) and the lack of documentation of blinded
outcome assessment (26) were largely responsible for the
low quality scores.

Ten trials documented the incidence of nonfatal and
fatal myocardial infarction (Table 2). The risk ratio of
nonfatal myocardial infarction in patients treated with an
n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid-enhanced diet, compared
with patients assigned a control diet or placebo, was 0.8
(95% conﬁdence interval [CI]: 0.5 to 1.2, P ⫽ 0.16; het-
erogeneity P ⫽ 0.01) (Figure). Among these patients, the
risk ratio was 0.7 (95% CI: 0.6 to 0.8, P ⬍0.001; hetero-
geneity P ⬎0.20) for fatal myocardial infarction, 0.7 (95%
CI: 0.6 to 0.9, P ⬍0.01; heterogeneity P ⬎0.20) for sudden
death (n ⫽ 5 trials), and 0.8 (95% CI: 0.7 to 0.9, P ⬍0.001;
heterogeneity P ⬎0.20) for overall death.

We found an asymmetric distribution for all end-
points, with the exception of nonfatal myocardial infarc-
tion. The smaller trials showed a larger effect size than did
the one larger trial (29).

outcome adjudicators) explained the heterogeneity ob-
served. For all endpoints, including nonfatal myocardial
infarction, in which we did ﬁnd statistically signiﬁcant
heterogeneity, summary estimates were similar in all sub-
groups. For nonfatal myocardial infarction, the risk ratio
in trials of dietary intervention compared with controls
was 0.7 (95% CI: 0.1 to 3.2), and 0.8 (95% CI: 0.55 to 1.2)
in trials of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid supplementa-
tion compared with controls. The risk ratio for fatal myo-
cardial infarction was 0.5 (95% CI: 0.3 to 1.1) in dietary
intervention trials and 0.8 (95% CI: 0.7 to 0.9) in supple-
mentation trials. The one dietary trial (21) that examined
sudden death generated a risk ratio of 0.1 (95% CI: 0 to
1.1), whereas the pooled estimate in the supplementation
trials was 0.7 (95% CI: 0.6 to 0.9; P ⫽ 0.09 for the differ-
ence of summary estimates). For overall mortality, the
risk ratio in trials of patients assigned n-3 polyunsatu-
rated fatty acid-enhanced diets was 0.7 (95% CI: 0.6 to
0.9), compared with 0.8 (95% CI: 0.7 to 0.9) in supple-
mentation trials.

DISCUSSION

Our meta-analysis suggests that a diet supplemented with
n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids may decrease mortality

due to myocardial reinfarction, sudden death, and overall
mortality in patients with coronary heart disease. The risk
reduction for mortality was statistically signiﬁcant. The
mortality in control groups of trials that followed patients
for an average of 1.5 years varied from 1% to 22%, sug-
gesting that in low-risk patients (e.g., those aged ⬍50
years and with minor uncomplicated infarctions and no
comorbid conditions) with mortality of about 2% per
year, approximately 250 patients would need to receive
n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid supplementation for 1.5
years to prevent a single premature death (number
needed to treat). In patients with higher mortality rates of
22%, approximately 24 patients would need to be treated
to prevent one event.

Our review has several limitations. First, we cannot
rule out publication bias, although we performed a com-
prehensive literature search. The smaller trials showed a
larger effect size than did the Gruppo Italiano per lo Stu-
dio della Sopravivenza nell’ Infarto Miocardico (GISSI)
trial (29), suggesting that small unpublished trials might
have a negligible effect on outcomes, and thereby reduc-
ing estimates of treatment effect.

Second, the amount and type (pharmacological, non-
dietary versus dietary intervention) of n-3 polyunsatu-
rated fatty acid varied considerably. For example, the

GISSI trial used lower doses of eicosapentaenoic acid and
docosahexanoic acid (29), whereas in another study the
intake of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids was mainly from
fatty ﬁsh (20). In the Lyon Heart Project Study (21), al-
pha-linolenic acid, which is a n-3 fatty acid of plant ori-
gin, and the low intake of saturated fats (8% of energy
intake), was the main dietary factor that differed between
the intervention and control groups. In our sensitivity
analysis, we could not identify relevant differences be-
tween groups in the effects of dietary and supplement
intake of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids on clinical end-
points. This may have been due to lack of power or our
inability to identify additional relevant factors from the
data.

Third, several studies had an open intervention design
and used unblinded clinical endpoint assessments, which
led to lower scores for trial quality, as measured with our
modiﬁed Jadad score, as well as resulted in an overesti-
mation of the treatment effects (30,31).

Finally, in most of the trials that had restenosis as the
primary endpoint, no information on the diagnostic cri-
teria or blinded outcome assessment of clinical endpoints

was provided, and therefore bias may have been intro-
duced. However, because these trials were small and con-
tributed only few events, it is less likely that the summary
estimates for fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarction
were affected. In contrast, only 5 trials (15, 21, 25, 27, 29)
reported the incidence of sudden death, whereas the Diet
and Reinfarction Trial (DART) did not. The potential
bias may not have inﬂuenced overall mortality given the
consistency of the ﬁndings of a reduction in mortality in
all 9 trials, including DART.

The protective effect of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids
in coronary heart disease is mediated through various
actions. N-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids reduce endothe-
lium dysfunction by reducing sympathetic overactivity
(32) and enhancing nitric oxide-mediated vasodilatation
(9). They reduce the inﬂammatory endothelium re-
sponse by inhibiting monocyte adhesion (33) and by sup-
pressing inﬂammatory mediators and thromboxane Az, a
prostaglandin that induces platelet aggregation and vaso-
constriction (34). Platelet-derived growth factor-like
proteins from vascular endothelial cells are also sup-

attenuate endothelial cell proliferation. N-3 polyunsatu-
rated fatty acid supplementation affects hemostatic
markers of atherosclerosis, such as thrombomodulin and
von Willebrand factor (35), as well as reduces insulin re-
sistance (36).

In our analysis, the antilipidemic effect of n-3 polyun-
saturated fatty acids was limited to an average 20% reduc-
tion in triglyceride levels, with little effect on LDL and
HDL cholesterol levels, which is consistent with other
ﬁndings (37). Of note, only a small proportion of patients
received additional antilipidemic drugs (27–29). The role
of triglycerides in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis is
still controversial because prospective epidemiologic
studies found an inconsistent relation between triglycer-
ide levels and coronary heart disease (38,39). Future stud-
ies should examine if the triglyceride-lowering properties
of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids have additional effects,
particular in patients with mixed hyperlipidemia and in-
sulin resistance.

Finally, data from animal studies suggest that n-3 poly-
unsaturated fatty acids have antiarrhythmic effects in
coronary heart disease (40,41). They may prolong the in-
activated state of the sodium and calcium channels in
myocytes, and inhibit the conductance of these channels
(41,42). In the present analysis, all estimates from indi-
vidual trials and the summary estimate showed that n-3
polyunsaturated fatty acids protected consistently against
sudden death.

N-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids may lead to a consid-
erable reduction in fatal myocardial infarction and over-
all mortality in the secondary prevention of coronary
heart disease. Because they have different mechanisms
from those of other agents that reduce coronary heart
disease mortality, we suggest that adequately powered tri-
als should study the possible added beneﬁt of n-3 poly-
unsaturated fatty acid supplementation in conjunction
with treatment involving statins, antiplatelets, beta-
blockers, or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors.
