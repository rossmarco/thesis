Background
Results from prospective cohort studies and randomized, controlled trials have pro-
vided evidence of a protective effect of n−3 fatty acids against cardiovascular dis-
eases. We examined the effect of the marine n−3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid 
(EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and of the plant-derived alpha-linolenic acid 
(ALA) on the rate of cardiovascular events among patients who have had a myocar-
dial infarction.
Methods
In a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we randomly assigned 4837 
patients, 60 through 80 years of age (78% men), who had had a myocardial infarc-
tion and were receiving state-of-the-art antihypertensive, antithrombotic, and lipid-
modifying therapy to receive for 40 months one of four trial margarines: a marga-
rine supplemented with a combination of EPA and DHA (with a targeted additional 
daily intake of 400 mg of EPA–DHA), a margarine supplemented with ALA (with a 
targeted additional daily intake of 2 g of ALA), a margarine supplemented with 
EPA–DHA and ALA, or a placebo margarine. The primary end point was the rate of 
major cardiovascular events, which comprised fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular 
events and cardiac interventions. Data were analyzed according to the intention-to-
treat principle, with the use of Cox proportional-hazards models.
Results
The patients consumed, on average, 18.8 g of margarine per day, which resulted in 
additional intakes of 226 mg of EPA combined with 150 mg of DHA, 1.9 g of ALA, 
or both, in the active-treatment groups. During the follow-up period, a major car-
diovascular event occurred in 671 patients (13.9%). Neither EPA–DHA nor ALA re-
duced this primary end point (hazard ratio with EPA–DHA, 1.01; 95% confidence 
interval [CI], 0.87 to 1.17; P = 0.93; hazard ratio with ALA, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.78 to 1.05; 
P = 0.20). In the prespecified subgroup of women, ALA, as compared with placebo 
and EPA–DHA alone, was associated with a reduction in the rate of major cardio-
vascular events that approached significance (hazard ratio, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.51 to 1.03; 
P = 0.07). The rate of adverse events did not differ significantly among the study 
groups.
Conclusions
Low-dose supplementation with EPA–DHA or ALA did not significantly reduce the 
rate of major cardiovascular events among patients who had had a myocardial in-
farction and who were receiving state-of-the-art antihypertensive, antithrombotic, 
and lipid-modifying therapy. (Funded by the Netherlands Heart Foundation and oth-

A meta-analysis  of  randomized  tri-

als involving patients with cardiac disease 
showed  that  supplementation  with  the 
marine n−3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) 
and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) reduced the rate 
of death from coronary heart disease by 20%.1 
Mozaffarian  and  Rimm  concluded  from  their 
meta-analysis of cohort studies and clinical trials 
that a daily intake of 250 mg of EPA and DHA 
reduced the risk of fatal coronary heart disease 
by 36%.2 There was no additional benefit from 
higher intakes. There is less evidence for a pro-
tective effect of the plant-derived n−3 fatty acid 
alpha-linolenic  acid  (ALA).  A  meta-analysis  of 
five prospective cohort studies showed that the 
risk of fatal coronary heart disease was 21% lower 
among subjects who had a high intake of ALA 
than  among  subjects  who  had  a  low  intake  of 
ALA — a difference that was of borderline sig-
nificance.3 Data from randomized trials regard-
ing the effect of ALA supplementation on the rate 
of cardiovascular disease are lacking.

n−3 fatty acids may prevent ventricular arrhyth-
mias in patients who have had a myocardial in-
farction.4 Basic research has shown that enrich-
ment of myocardial membranes with these fatty 
acids reduces the vulnerability to cardiac arrhyth-
mias.5-7  These  results  corroborate  the  inverse 
associations that have been seen in case–control 
studies and cohort studies between fish in the 
diet, EPA and DHA content in the diet, or EPA 
and DHA concentration in the blood and the risk 
of  sudden  cardiac  death.8-11  However,  in  con-
trolled trials involving patients with cardiac dis-
ease who had implantable cardioverter–defibril-
lators,  high  doses  of  EPA  and  DHA  (ranging 
from 0.9 to 2.6 g per day) did not significantly 
reduce  the  rate  of  ventricular  arrhythmias.1  In 
the case of supplementation with ALA, an inverse 
relation  with  sudden  death  was  observed  in  a 
cohort study of women.12

Cohort studies have suggested that low doses 
of n−3 fatty acids should be sufficient to reduce 
cardiovascular risk.3,13,14 A dose–response rela-
tionship  between  the  intake  of  EPA  and  DHA 
and the risk of cardiac death has not been shown 
in randomized trials.1,15 We designed a trial to 
test the hypothesis that low doses of EPA–DHA 
(400 mg per day), ALA (2 g per day), or both, in 
margarines  reduce  the  risk  of  cardiovascular 
events among patients who have had a myocar-
dial infarction.

Methods

Study Design and Patients
The Alpha Omega Trial was a multicenter, dou-
ble-blind, placebo-controlled trial with a 2-by-2 
factorial design, which has been described in de-
tail previously.16 In brief, we recruited 4837 pa-
tients  in  collaboration  with  cardiologists  at  32 
hospitals in the Netherlands. Men and women, 
60 to 80 years of age, who had had a clinically 
diagnosed myocardial infarction up to 10 years 
before randomization were eligible for participa-
tion. Major exclusion criteria were daily consump-
tion of less than 10 g of margarine, use of n−3 
fatty-acid  supplements,  unintended  weight  loss 
of more than 5 kg in the previous year, and a 
diagnosis of cancer with an estimated life expec-
tancy of less than 1 year.

Patients were enrolled from April 2002 through 
December 2006 and were randomly assigned to 
receive trial margarines that provided low doses 
of n−3 fatty acids or placebo, according to a 2-by-2 
factorial design, for 40 months. For logistic rea-
sons, all the patients were given placebo marga-
rine during the first 4 to 6 weeks after random-
ization. After this period, the patients received 
one of four trial margarines: a margarine with 
no additional n−3 fatty acids (placebo margarine) 
or  a  margarine  with  approximately  400  mg  of 
EPA–DHA per day, 2 g of ALA per day, or a com-
bination of EPA–DHA and ALA. The doses of the 
n−3 fatty acids corresponded to the recommended 
dietary allowances of those fatty acids.17 In the 
trial margarines for the active-treatment groups, 
the various n−3 fatty acids replaced an equivalent 
amount of the oleic acid in the margarine (see 
Table 1 in the Supplementary Appendix, available 
with  the  full  text  of  this  article  at  NEJM.org). 
The ratio of EPA to DHA in the margarines was 
3:2. The margarines were similar to each other 
in taste, odor, texture, and color.

All  patients  provided  written  informed  con-
sent. The trial was approved by a central medical 
ethics  committee  (Haga  Hospital,  Leyenburg, 
The Hague, the Netherlands) and by the ethics 
committee  at  each  participating  hospital.  The 
steering committee monitored the progress of 
the  trial,  and  the  data  and  safety  monitoring 
board monitored the safety of the patients. An 
interim analysis with the group assignments con-
cealed was performed in February 2007. On the 
basis of the outcome of that analysis, the steer-

ing committee decided to continue the trial as 
planned.

The  Alpha  Omega  trial  was  initiated  by  the 
first author and carried out by the Alpha Omega 
Study  Group.  The  first  author  wrote  the  first 
draft of the manuscript, and the other authors 
contributed to subsequent drafts. The margarines 
were developed by  Unilever  R&D  (Vlaardingen, 
the Netherlands), which provided an unrestricted 
grant for the distribution of the trial margarines 
to the patients. The funding organizations had no 
role  in  the  design  of  the  study;  the  collection, 
analysis, or interpretation of the data; the writing 
of the manuscript; or the decision to submit the 
manuscript for publication. The authors vouch for 
the  accuracy  and  completeness  of  the  reported 
data as well as the fidelity of the report to the 
study protocol. The protocol, including the sta-
tistical analysis plan, is available at NEJM.org.

in the case of patients who had fasted more than 
4 hours or ≥11.1 mmol per liter [200.0 mg per 
deciliter] in the case of nonfasting patients). Base-
line examinations were repeated after 20 months 
in a random sample of 810 patients and after 40 
months in the 2531 patients (52.3%) who com-
pleted the trial before January 1, 2009. Owing to 
budget constraints, assessments of the remainder 
of the cohort were made with the use of ques-
tionnaires regarding demographic factors, lifestyle 
characteristics, and medication and medical his-
tories that were mailed to the patients. Trained 
research  staff  performed  structured  telephone 
interviews with more than 90% of the cohort 12 
and 24 months after the start of the intervention 
to  collect  data  on  adherence,  cardiovascular 
events, adverse events, changes in medication, 
intake of fish, and use of n−3 fatty acid supple-
ments.

Procedures
The study intervention in our trial was replace-
ment  of  margarines  that  the  patients  usually 
used with study margarines, as opposed to sup-
plementation  with  fish-oil  capsules,  which  has 
been used in previous trials. After the patients un-
derwent randomization, they received eight tubs, 
each of which contained 250 g of margarine, the 
specific composition of which could not be iden-
tified. The patients received a new set of tubs every 
12 weeks. Unused margarine tubs were returned. 
The daily intakes of margarine and n−3 fatty ac-
ids were calculated on the basis of the amount of 
margarine that the patients were given and the 
amount that was returned unused. An objective 
measure of adherence was obtained by determin-
ing the levels of fatty acids in plasma cholesteryl 
esters  in  random  subgroups  of  approximately 
800  patients  at  baseline  and  after  20  and  40 
months of intervention.16

At  baseline,  anthropometric  measures  were 
assessed, and blood pressure and heart rate were 
measured.  In  addition,  nonfasting  blood  sam-
ples were obtained for the measurement of serum 
lipid and plasma glucose levels.16 Demographic 
factors, lifestyle characteristics, and medication 
and medical histories were assessed with the use 
of questionnaires. Diabetes was considered to be 
present if a patient reported having received the 
diagnosis from a physician, was taking antidia-
betic drugs, or had an elevated plasma glucose 
level (≥7.0 mmol per liter [126 mg per deciliter] 

End Points
We  followed  all  patients,  including  those  who 
discontinued the use of the trial margarine dur-
ing the course of the trial, for the ascertainment 
of clinical events. We monitored the vital status 
of all the patients by means of a computerized 
link with municipal registries. In the case of pa-
tients who died, the death certificate was obtained 
from Statistics Netherlands, and the patient’s pri-
mary physician filled out a standard form listing 
the  primary  and  contributing  causes  of  death. 
Additional information on fatal events was ob-
tained from hospitals and family members. Events 
were coded by three members of the end-point 
adjudication  committee,  who  were  unaware  of 
the identity of the patient, the identity of the treat-
ing physician, and the patient’s assigned study 
group. During regular meetings, all information 
about  the  underlying  causes  of  death  was  dis-
cussed by the committee members. In the case of 
disagreement, discussion among the three mem-
bers took place until consensus was reached.

Patients were asked to record all hospitaliza-
tions in a structured diary. Follow-up to ascertain 
the occurrence of non fatal cardiovascular events 
(myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest, and stroke) 
and cardiac interventions (percutaneous coronary 
intervention [PCI], coronary-artery bypass graft-
ing [CABG], and placement of implantable cardio-
verter–defibrillators) was performed by research 
staff through annual telephone interviews. Self-
reported nonfatal cardiovascular events and car-

diac interventions were verified against hospital 
records by trained research nurses or the research 
physician. Only events for which documentation 
of the clinical diagnosis (e.g., hospital discharge 
letters) could be retrieved were considered in the 
analysis. We also monitored incident prostate can-
cer, because a meta-analysis of epidemiologic stud-
ies suggested that ALA could be associated with 
an  increased  risk  of  prostate  cancer.3  Incident 
prostate cancer included fatal cases and verified 
hospital admissions for prostate cancer. Causes of 
death were coded according to the International 
Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision.18

The primary end point of this trial was major 
cardiovascular events, which comprised fatal and 
nonfatal cardiovascular disease and the cardiac 
interventions  PCI  and  CABG.16  Secondary  end 
points were incident cardiovascular disease, fatal 
cardiovascular disease, fatal coronary heart dis-
ease, ventricular-arrhythmia–related events (sud-
den death, fatal and nonfatal cardiac arrest, and 
placement  of  implantable  cardioverter–defibril-
lators), and death from any cause.

Statistical Analysis
Pretrial and post hoc power calculations for the 
study are provided in the Supplementary Appen-
dix. Analysis of the data was performed before 
the treatment codes were broken, by an indepen-
dent biostatistician who used a prespecified sta-
tistical analysis plan. Analyses were performed 
according to the intention-to-treat principle. Time-
to-event data were analyzed with the use of the 
Kaplan–Meier method and the log-rank test. The 
two  groups  that  received  EPA–DHA  were  com-
bined and compared with the two groups that did 
not receive EPA–DHA. Similarly, the two groups 
that received ALA were combined and compared 
with the two groups that did not receive ALA. 
Hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals were 
calculated with the use of Cox proportional-haz-
ards models.

Prespecified subgroup analyses were performed 
according to age, sex, time since the index myo-
cardial infarction, baseline intake of fish and of 
EPA–DHA, and use of margarine during the trial. 
In  addition,  a  post  hoc  analysis  (i.e.,  after  un-
blinding of the data) was performed according 
to the presence or absence of diabetes. No ad-
justments have been made for multiple compari-
sons. Two-sided P values of less than 0.05 were 

considered  to  indicate  statistical  significance. 
Data were analyzed with the use of SAS, version 
9.2, and SPSS, version 17.0, statistical software.

R esults

Patients
We enrolled 4837 patients — 3783 men (78.2%) 
and 1054 women (21.8%) (Fig. 1). The median 
period between the index myocardial infarction 
and  entry  into  the  study  was  3.7  years  (inter-
quartile range, 1.7 to 6.3). In the case of 99.3% of 
the patients, the index myocardial infarction could 
be  verified  in  hospital  records.  Diabetes  was 
present in 1014 patients (21.0%). Antithrombotic 
agents  were  used  by  almost  all  the  patients 
(97.5%), antihypertensive drugs by 89.7%, lipid-
modifying treatment (mainly statins) by 86.0%, 
and  antiarrhythmic  drugs  by  3.0%.  Hormone-
replacement therapy was reported by 2.2% of the 
women. A total of 16.9% of the study patients 
were  current  smokers,  and  24.2%  were  obese 
(i.e., had a body-mass index [the weight in kilo-
grams divided by the square of the height in me-
ters] of 30 or more). At baseline, the median con-
sumption of fish was 14.9 g per day (interquartile 
range,  6.1  to  18.7),  and  the  median  intake  of 
EPA–DHA  was  130  mg  per  day  (interquartile 
range, 60 to 210). A total of 225 patients (4.7%) 
reported  that  they  used  commercially  available 
n−3 fatty acid supplements at some point during 
the course of the trial. The four study groups did 
not  differ  significantly  with  respect  to  demo-
graphic factors, lifestyle characteristics, or cardio-
vascular risk factors (Table 1).

Study Intervention
The  mean  (±SD)  intake  of  trial  margarine  was 
18.8±4.7 g per day; 90.5% of the patients adhered 
fully to the protocol and consumed a mean of 
20.6±2.8 g of margarine per day. Patients in the 
two  EPA–DHA  groups  received,  on  average,  an 
additional 226 mg of EPA and 150 mg of DHA 
per day, and those in the two ALA groups received 
an additional 1.9 g of ALA per day. The median 
follow-up period was 40.8 months (interquartile 
range, 37.2 to 41.5), which included the first 4 to 
6 weeks in which all the patients received placebo 
margarine. After 20 months, the additional in-
take of n−3 fatty acids was reflected in the fatty-
acid composition of serum cholesteryl esters: ALA

supplementation in the margarine increased se-
rum ALA by 69.6% as compared with placebo and 
EPA–DHA only, and EPA–DHA supplementation 
increased serum EPA by 53.3% and serum DHA by 
28.6%, as compared with placebo and ALA only 
(Fig. 1 in the Supplementary Appendix). These 
changes were already apparent after 3 months in 
a pilot study of 76 patients, in which ALA in-
creased by 49.0%, EPA by 41.3%, and DHA by 
13.5%. The changes in the serum concentration 
of n−3 fatty acids from baseline to 20 months 
were maintained until 40 months. Serum triglyc-
eride  levels  and  other  markers  of  risk  did  not 
change significantly in the groups that received 
supplemented margarine, as compared with the 
placebo group, during the course of the trial (Ta-
ble 2 in the Supplementary Appendix).

Effect of n−3 Fatty Acids on Study End Points
No patients were lost to follow-up. We accrued 
15,531 person-years of follow-up data, and 671 
patients (13.9%) had a major cardiovascular event. 
The effects of n−3 fatty acids on end points are 
presented in Table 2. Kaplan–Meier curves showed 
that  EPA–DHA  (either  alone  or  in  combination 
with ALA), as compared with placebo and ALA 
only, had no effect on the rate of major cardio-
vascular events (Fig. 2). The two groups that re-
ceived  ALA  had  a  rate  of  major  cardiovascular 
events  that  was  9%  lower  than  the  rate  in  the 
groups that received placebo or EPA–DHA only, a 
difference that was not significant (hazard ratio, 
0.91; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.78 to 1.05; 
P = 0.20). The Kaplan–Meier curve for fatal coro-
nary  heart  disease  showed  that  until  approxi-

mately 30 months after the start of the interven-
tion, the patients in the two groups that received 
EPA–DHA had a lower risk of fatal coronary heart 
disease than did those who received placebo or 
ALA only, but this effect disappeared toward the 
end of the trial (Fig. 2). There were nonsignifi-
cant reductions of 10% and of 21% in ventricular- 
arrhythmia–related  events  among  patients  who 
received EPA–DHA and ALA, respectively (Table 2, 
and Fig. 2 in the Supplementary Appendix).

Subgroup Analyses
Analyses of prespecified subgroups showed that 
the two groups that received EPA–DHA did not 
have significantly lower rates of major cardiovas-
cular events than did the two groups that re-

ceived  no  EPA–DHA,  and  the  two  groups  that 
received  ALA  did  not  have  significantly  lower 
rates of major cardiovascular events than did the 
two groups that received no ALA. However, there 
was  a  27%  reduction  in  major  cardiovascular 
events with ALA among women, which approached 
significance (hazard ratio, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.51 to 
1.03; P = 0.07) (Fig. 3). Patients with diabetes had 
a  higher  risk  of  all  cardiovascular  end  points 
than did patients without diabetes (Table 3). A 
post hoc, exploratory analysis of data from these 
diabetic patients showed that the rates of fatal 
coronary heart disease and arrhythmia-related 
events  were  lower  among  patients  in  the  EPA–
DHA  groups  than  among  those  in  the  groups 
that received no EPA–DHA (hazard ratio for fatal

0.51; 95% CI, 0.24 to 1.11) (Table 3, and Fig. 3 
in  the  Supplementary  Appendix).  The  rate  of 
arrhythmia-related  events  was  also  reduced  in 
the ALA groups, as compared with the groups 
that received no ALA (hazard ratio, 0.39; 95% CI, 
0.17 to 0.88).

Adverse Events
The rate of self-reported gastrointestinal symp-

Figure 3 (facing page). Effect of EPA–DHA Supplemen-
tation and ALA Supplementation on the Primary End 
Point in Subgroups of Patients.
The primary end point of major cardiovascular events 
comprised fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events and 
the cardiac interventions percutaneous coronary inter­
vention and coronary­artery bypass grafting. Panel A 
shows the effects of supplementation with eicosapenta­
enoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and 
Panel B the effects of supplementation with alpha­lino­
lenic acid (ALA). Hazard ratios and 95% confidence in­
tervals were calculated with the use of Cox proportional­
hazards models. The size of each square is proportional 
to the number of patients; horizontal lines indicate 
95% confidence intervals. P values are for the differ­
ence between active treatment and placebo.

Discussion

An additional daily intake of an average of 376 mg 
of  EPA–DHA  or  1.9  g  of  ALA  did  not  signifi-
cantly  reduce  the  rate  of  major  cardiovascular 
events in patients who had had a myocardial in-
farction and who were receiving state-of-the-art 
antihypertensive, antithrombotic, and lipid-mod-
ifying therapy. A prespecified analysis according 
to sex showed that there were fewer major car-
diovascular events among women who received 
ALA than among women who received placebo, a 
reduction that approached significance. The num-
ber of adverse events did not differ significantly 
among the groups during the course of the inter-
vention.

In this study, a low dose of EPA–DHA had no 
effect on the rate of major cardiovascular events 
in patients who had had a myocardial infarction. 
However, previous randomized, controlled trials 
involving patients with cardiac disease did show 
protective effects of EPA, either with or without 
DHA, on various composite cardiovascular end 
points.19-21  This  discrepancy  may  be  related  to 
differences between patient populations in age, 
sex  distribution,  and  presence  or  absence  of  a 
history  of  coronary  artery  disease.  The  patient 
population in our trial consisted mainly of men, 
the average age of the patients was 69 years, and 
the index myocardial infarction had occurred an 
average of 4 years before enrollment. In contrast, 
the participants in the Gruppo Italiano per lo Stu-
dio  della  Sopravvivenza  nell’Infarto  Miocardico 
(GISSI) trials were patients who had had a recent 
myocardial infarction (<3 months before enroll-
ment)19 or patients with heart failure (GISSI-HF; 
ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00336336),20 and 
the patients in the Japan Eicosapentaenoic Acid 
(EPA)  Lipid  Intervention  Study  (JELIS;  NCT 0-
0 231738)  were  mostly  women.21  These  popula-
tions were also about 10 years younger than were 
the patients in our study.

The lack of an effect of EPA–DHA in our trial 
could be due to an improvement in cardioprotec-
tive  drug  treatment,  such  as  that  seen  in  the 
time between the 1995–1996 and the 2006–2007 
European Action on Secondary Prevention through 
Intervention  to  Reduce  Events  (EUROASPIRE) 
surveys.22 The introduction of statins represent-
ed a major change in the treatment of patients 
with cardiovascular disease in the early 1990s, 
as  shown  in  the  GISSI-Prevenzione  trial,19  in 

which only 5% of the patients received statins at 
baseline (1993–1995), whereas 46% were receiv-
ing them after 42 months of intervention. In our 
trial, 85% of the patients were receiving statins. 
The survival rates in the GISSI-Prevenzione trial 
were lower than those in our study (Table 2). In 
recent years, not only has there been improve-
ment  in  survival  but  the  causes  of  death  have 
shifted from cardiovascular to noncardiovascu-
lar causes.23 Consequently, among patients who 
have  had  a  myocardial  infarction  but  who  are 
receiving good clinical care and are at relatively 
low risk for future cardiovascular events, such as 
the patients in the Alpha Omega Trial, a benefi-
cial effect of low doses of EPA–DHA is difficult 
to prove.24 Finally, we cannot exclude the possi-
bility that EPA and DHA had no therapeutic ef-
fect in patients who had had a myocardial infarc-
tion but whose condition was stable and who 
were at relatively low risk for future cardiovascu-
lar events.

We  observed  a  nonsignificant  9%  reduction 
in the primary end point with ALA supplementa-
tion,  as  compared  with  placebo  and  EPA–DHA 
only, in the total patient population and a 27% 
reduction, which approached significance, among 
women. The Kaplan–Meier curves started to di-
verge after approximately 20 months, especially 
among women (Fig. 4 in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix), suggesting that there was a cumulative 
effect  over  time.  ALA  may  slow  the  formation 
and calcification of atherosclerotic plaque, as sug-
gested by the results of cross-sectional analyses 
in the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute 
Family  Heart  Study.25,26  Other  possible  mecha-
nisms of a beneficial effect of ALA on cardiovas-
cular disease are plaque stabilization27 and anti-
arrhythmic  effects,7  either  directly  or  through 
desaturation and elongation of ALA into EPA. It 
is also possible that this apparent effect was due 
to  the play of chance. Additional trials involving 
high-risk patients, however, are needed to prove a 
cardioprotective effect of ALA.

Patients with diabetes who have had a myo-
cardial infarction are particularly prone to ven-
tricular arrhythmias and sudden death.4,28 In a 
post hoc, exploratory analysis of data from these 
diabetic patients, we found reductions in cardio-
vascular end points with EPA–DHA, as compared 
with placebo, that were in line with those shown 
in  the  GISSI  Prevenzione  trial.19  The  strongest 
effects  —  reductions  of  approximately  50%  —

were  the  effects  on  the  rates  of  fatal  coronary 
heart disease and arrhythmia-related events. The 
rate of arrhythmia-related events was also reduced 
with ALA as compared with placebo or EPA–DHA 
only. This finding is supported by the results of 
a cohort study involving women, in which ALA 
intake was inversely associated with the risk of 
sudden death.12 However, it is important to note 
that our results with respect to patients with dia-
betes are only hypothesis-generating and do not 
permit definitive conclusions to be drawn.

In conclusion, in this trial involving patients 
who had had a myocardial infarction and who 
were receiving good clinical care, low doses of 
n−3 fatty acids did not significantly reduce the 
rates of cardiovascular end points.
