Purpose: Our aim was examine the association between black tea consumption and risk of total stroke
and stroke types in a prospective study.
Methods: A total of 74,961 Swedish women and men who were free of cardiovascular disease and cancer
at baseline in 1997 were followed up through December 2008. Tea consumption was assessed with
a questionnaire at baseline. Stroke cases were ascertained from the Swedish Hospital Discharge Registry.
Results: During a mean follow-up of 10.2 years, we ascertained 4089 cases of ﬁrst stroke, including 3159
cerebral infarctions, 435 intracerebral hemorrhages, 148 subarachnoid hemorrhages, and 347 unspeciﬁed
strokes. After adjustment for other risk factors, high tea consumption was associated with a signiﬁcantly
lower risk of total stroke; however, there was no doseeresponse relation (P for trend ¼ .36). Compared
with no tea consumption, the multivariable relative risk for four or more cups per day (median, 5) was
0.79 (95% conﬁdence interval [CI], 0.62e0.998). The corresponding relative risks were 0.80 (95% CI,
0.61e1.04) for cerebral infarction and 0.68 (95% CI, 0.35e1.30) for hemorrhagic stroke.
Conclusions: These ﬁndings suggest that daily consumption of four or more cups of black tea is inversely
associated with risk of stroke.

Introduction

Tea consumption is postulated to have beneﬁcial effects on
cardiovascular risk because of its ﬂavonoid content. Flavonoids
present in tea have been shown to inhibit the development of
atherosclerosis in animal models [1]. Evidence also indicates that
tea and tea ﬂavonoids can enhance nitric oxide status and
improve endothelial function [1]. Results from a meta-analysis of
controlled intervention studies showed that moderate consump-
tion of black tea (median daily dose of 500 mL, corresponding to
about 2e3 cups) substantially enhanced endothelial-dependent
vasodilation [2].

Prospective studies of

the association between black tea
consumption and risk of stroke have yielded inconsistent results.
An inverse association between black tea consumption and stroke
risk was observed in some studies [3e5] but not in others [5e9].
Only one study reported results for stroke types [4]. That study
among Finnish men found that tea consumption was inversely
associated with risk of cerebral infarction but not hemorrhagic
stroke [4].

Given the inconsistent results and the paucity of data on stroke
types, we examined the relation between black tea consumption
and risk of total stroke as well as cerebral infarction and hemor-
rhagic stroke in a large, prospective study of Swedish women and
men.

Methods

Study population

Our study population consisted of participants from two
population-based cohort studies: The Swedish Mammography
Cohort and the Cohort of Swedish Men. Details about these cohorts
have been described previously [10,11]. In brief, in the autumn of
1997, 39,227 women and 48,850 men who resided in central
Sweden completed a 350-item questionnaire about diet and other
lifestyle factors. For the present analyses, we excluded participants
with an erroneous or a missing National Registration Number, those
with implausible values for total energy intake (i.e., 3 standard
deviations from the loge-transformed mean energy intake in
women and men) and those with a diagnosis of stroke, coronary
heart disease or cancer before baseline. This left 74,961 participants
(34,670 women and 40,291 men), aged 45 to 83 years, for the
present analyses. The study was approved by the Regional Ethical
Review Board at Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm, Sweden.

Baseline data collection

In 1997, participants completed a questionnaire that inquired
information about education, weight, height, smoking, physical
activity, aspirin use, history of hypertension and diabetes, family
history of myocardial infarction before 60 years of age, alcohol
consumption, and diet. Pack-years of smoking history were
computed by multiplying the number of packs of cigarettes smoked
per day by the number of years of smoking. Body mass index was
calculated as the weight (in kilograms) divided by the square of
height (in meters). Total physical activity (in 24 hours) was
expressed in metabolic equivalents, and was calculated based on
each participant’s level of activity at work, home/housework,
walking/bicycling, and exercise, and by taking into account hours
per day of watching TV/reading and sleeping [12].

Dietary assessment

Tea consumption was assessed with a self-administered food
frequency questionnaire on which participants reported their
average frequency of consumption of tea and 95 other food items
over the previous year. For tea consumption, participants were
asked to indicate the exact number of cups of tea consumed per day
or per week. One cup was speciﬁed on the questionnaire as 1.5 dL.
In a validation study in a subsample of women from the cohort, the
Pearson correlation coefﬁcients for tea consumption between
a previous questionnaire and four 1-week diet records (completed
3e4 months apart) was 0.81 (A. Wolk, unpublished data).

Ascertainment of stroke cases

We ascertained incident cases of ﬁrst stroke by linkage of the
study population (using the National Registration Number) to the
Swedish Hospital Discharge Registry, which provides almost
complete coverage of the discharges. The strokes were classiﬁed as
cerebral
infarction (International Classiﬁcation of Diseases, 10th
revision, code I63), intracerebral hemorrhage (I61), subarachnoid
hemorrhage (I60), and unspeciﬁed stroke (I64). Dates of death were
obtained from the Swedish Death Register.

Statistical analysis

We computed person-time of follow-up for each participant
from January 1, 1998 until the date of a ﬁrst stroke, death, or end of
follow-up (December 31, 2008), whichever occurred ﬁrst. Partici-
pants were grouped into ﬁve categories of tea consumption:
Nondrinkers, less than one cup per day, one cup per day, two to
three cups per day, and four or more cups per day. We combined
two and three cups per day because of limited number of partici-
pants in each category and results were similar for two and three
cups per day. We could not divide the highest category further
because only 2.7% of participants consumed four or more cups per
day. We used Cox proportional hazards regression models to esti-
mate relative risks with their 95% conﬁdence intervals (CI). Separate
analyses for women and men showed similar patterns of associa-
tion between tea consumption and stroke. We therefore present
results for women and men combined with adjustment for gender
as a stratum variable in the Cox model. All analyses were also
adjusted for age (in months) as a stratum variable. In the multi-
variable models, we additionally controlled for smoking status and
pack-years of smoking (never; past <20, 20e39, or 40 pack-years;
or current <20, 20e39, or 40 pack-years), education (less than
high school, high school, or university), body mass index (<20,
20e24.9, 25e29.9, or 30 kg/m2), total physical activity (metabolic
equivalent h/d, in quintiles), aspirin use (never, 1e6 tablets/wk, 7

no), family history of myocardial infarction before age 60 (yes or
no), and intakes of total energy (kcal/d, continuous variable), and
quartiles of alcohol, coffee, fruits, and vegetables. We tested the
proportional hazards assumption and found no departure from the
assumption.

We conducted tests for trends by assigning the median value for
each category of tea consumption and entered this variable as
a continuous variable in the model. We conducted stratiﬁed anal-
yses to examine whether the association between tea consumption
and stroke was modiﬁed by history of hypertension (no or yes),
smoking status (never or ever smoker), or coffee consumption (<3
or 3 cups/d). Test for interaction was performed using the likeli-
hood ratio test. All statistical analyses were performed using SAS,
version 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). All statistical tests were
2-sided; P < .05 was considered signiﬁcant.

Results

Over a mean follow-up of 10.2 years, we identiﬁed 4089 cases of
stroke (1680 in women and 2409 in men), including 3159 cerebral
infarctions, 435 intracerebral hemorrhages, 148 subarachnoid
hemorrhages, and 347 unspeciﬁed strokes. Baseline characteristics
of study participants according to categories of tea consumption are
shown in Table 1. Compared with women and men who never
consumed tea, those who consumed four or more cups per day
were more likely to have a postsecondary education but were less
likely to be current smokers and to have a history of hypertension.
In addition, those with high tea consumption tended to consume
more fruits and vegetables but drank less coffee.
High tea consumption (4 cups/d) was associated with
a statistically signiﬁcant lower risk of total stroke but there was no
doseeresponse relation (Table 2). Women and men who consumed
four or more cups per day ay of tea (median, 5 cups/d) had a 21%
(95% CI, 0.002%e38%) reduced risk of stroke compared with those
who never consumed tea. Further adjustment for fresh red meat,
processed meat, ﬁsh, and chocolate consumption did not change
the risk estimates. Daily consumption of 1 to 3 cups of tea was not
associated with stroke risk. Because of the apparent threshold effect
of tea consumption on stroke risk, we combined the four lowest
categories. In this threshold model, the multivariable relative risk of

family history of myocardial infarction, and intakes of total energy, alcohol, coffee, fruits, and vegetables.

Threshold model with the ﬁrst four categories of tea consumption (0e3 cups/d) as the reference category.
P for the relative risk.
The highest two categories were combined because of a very limited number of cases in the highest category (n ¼ 7 for intracerebral infarction and n ¼ 3 for subarachnoid

hemorrhage).

total stroke for women and men who consumed four or more cups
per day of tea compared with those who consumed fewer than four
cups per day was 0.77 (95% CI, 0.61e0.98; Table 2). The association
between tea consumption and stroke risk was similar for cerebral
infarction and total hemorrhagic stroke but the results were
signiﬁcant in the multivariable models. Tea consumption was
nonsigniﬁcantly and inversely associated with risk of intracerebral
hemorrhage, but not subarachnoid hemorrhage.

In stratiﬁed analysis by gender, the multivariable RRs of total
stroke for consumption of four or more cups per day of tea
compared with fewer than four cups per day were 0.69 (95% CI,
0.47e1.01) in women and 0.85 (95% CI, 0.63e1.14) in men (P for
interaction ¼ .66). The association of tea consumption with risk of
stroke was not modiﬁed by history of hypertension (P for
interaction ¼ .53), smoking (P for interaction ¼ .66), or coffee
consumption (P for interaction ¼ .24).

Discussion

In this prospective study, women and men who consumed four
or more cups per day of tea had a statistically signiﬁcant 21% lower
risk of stroke compared with never drinkers. The association
seemed to be conﬁned to cerebral infarction and intracerebral
hemorrhage, but results for stroke types were not signiﬁcant.

Previous prospective studies of black tea consumption and risk
of stroke have produced inconsistent results. Our ﬁndings are
similar to those from a cohort of Finnish male smokers [4] and
a cohort of U.S. nurses [5] showing that those who consumed two or
more cups (Finnish cohort) or four or more cups per day (U.S.
cohort) of black tea had a 21% reduced risk of stroke compared with
nondrinkers or seldom drinkers of tea. Furthermore, a prospective
study of 552 Dutch men found that daily consumption of 4.7 or
more cups of black tea versus fewer than 2.6 cups was associated

with a statistically signiﬁcant 69% lower stroke risk [3]. Other
studies conducted in The Netherlands [6,7] and in the United States
[8,9] found no association between black tea consumption and
stroke incidence or mortality.

There are several potential mechanisms by which tea
consumption may reduce the risk of stroke. Tea contains high levels
of ﬂavonoids, which are very effective radical scavengers that can
reduce oxidative damage by scavenging oxygen free radicals [13].
Human intervention studies with black or green tea have demon-
strated a signiﬁcant increase in plasma antioxidant capacity in
humans about 1 hour after consumption of moderate amounts of
tea (1e6 cups) [13]. For example, in an intervention study by Ser-
aﬁni et al. [14], 300 mL of black tea produced a signiﬁcant increase
in plasma total antioxidant capacity, with a peak after 50 minutes
after ingestion. Black tea consumption was further shown to reduce
oxidation of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [14]. In addition,
ingestion of tea and tea ﬂavonoids has been demonstrated to
enhance nitric oxide status and endothelial-dependent vasodilation
as well as improve endothelial function [1,2].

The strength of our study includes its prospective design, which
eliminated the possibility of recall bias. Another strength is the
completeness of case ascertainment by linkage to Swedish regis-
tries. Furthermore, this is the largest study to date (with regard to
number of stroke cases) on black tea consumption and stroke risk.
As in any observational study, we cannot exclude the possibility
that our ﬁndings have been affected by uncontrolled or residual
confounding. High tea consumption was related to higher educa-
tion and a healthy lifestyle. We controlled for education and other
potential confounders and the results persisted and did not differ
materially from the age- and gender-adjusted results. Still, we
cannot rule out that those with high consumption of black tea had
other healthier habits than nondrinkers. Another limitation is the
lack of information about treatment and control of hypertension.

Although our study was large, we had limited statistical power in
analysis of hemorrhagic stroke.

In summary, ﬁndings from this prospective study indicate that
daily consumption of four or more cups of black tea is inversely
associated with stroke risk. Further large studies in populations
with high black tea consumption are needed to conﬁrm the asso-
ciation between black tea consumption and stroke.
