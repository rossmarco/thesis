BACKGROUND
In Western populations, a higher level of fruit consumption has been associated 
with a lower risk of cardiovascular disease, but little is known about such asso-
ciations in China, where the consumption level is low and rates of stroke are high.

METHODS
Between 2004 and 2008, we recruited 512,891 adults, 30 to 79 years of age, from 
10 diverse localities in China. During 3.2 million person-years of follow-up, 5173 
deaths from cardiovascular disease, 2551 incident major coronary events (fatal or 
nonfatal), 14,579 ischemic strokes, and 3523 intracerebral hemorrhages were re-
corded among the 451,665 participants who did not have a history of cardiovascu-
lar disease or antihypertensive treatments at baseline. Cox regression yielded ad-
justed hazard ratios relating fresh fruit consumption to disease rates.

RESULTS
Overall, 18.0% of participants reported consuming fresh fruit daily. As compared 
with participants who never or rarely consumed fresh fruit (the “nonconsumption” 
category), those who ate fresh fruit daily had lower systolic blood pressure (by 
4.0 mm Hg) and blood glucose levels (by 0.5 mmol per liter [9.0 mg per deciliter]) 
(P<0.001  for  trend  for  both  comparisons).  The  adjusted  hazard  ratios  for  daily 
consumption  versus  nonconsumption  were  0.60  (95%  confidence  interval  [CI], 
0.54 to 0.67) for cardiovascular death, and 0.66 (95% CI, 0.58 to 0.75), 0.75 (95% 
CI, 0.72 to 0.79), and 0.64 (95% CI, 0.56 to 0.74), respectively, for incident major 
coronary events, ischemic stroke, and hemorrhagic stroke. There was a strong log-
linear dose–response relationship between the incidence of each outcome and the 
amount of fresh fruit consumed. These associations were similar across the 10 study 
regions and in subgroups of participants defined by baseline characteristics.

CONCLUSIONS
Among Chinese adults, a higher level of fruit consumption was associated with 
lower blood pressure and blood glucose levels and, largely independent of these 
and other dietary and nondietary factors, with significantly lower risks of major 
cardiovascular diseases. (Funded by the Wellcome Trust and others.)

Cardiovascular disease is a leading 

cause  of  premature  death  and  disability 
worldwide  and  is  responsible  for  more 
than 17 million deaths annually, with approxi-
mately 80% of the disease burden in low- and 
middle-income countries, such as China.1 A low 
level of fruit consumption is a major risk factor 
for  cardiovascular  disease,  accounting  for  an 
estimated  104  million  disability-adjusted  life-
years  worldwide  in  2010,2  including  approxi-
mately 30 million in China.3 However, these es-
timates  were  based  mainly  on  findings  from 
Western  studies,  with  little  reliable  evidence 
from  China  and  other  developing  countries, 
where diet, lifestyle factors, and disease patterns 
differ substantially from those in Western popu-
lations.3-5 Moreover, most previous studies tend-
ed  to  involve  a  combination  of  fresh  and  pro-
cessed  fruit  (frozen,  dried,  or  canned  fruit  or 
fruit  juice),  with  limited  data  specifically  on 
fresh fruit, which is usually consumed raw as a 
snack in China. Furthermore, the associations of 
fruit intake with stroke subtypes, especially hem-
orrhagic  stroke,  are  less  well  established  than 
the  association  with  ischemic  heart  disease,3,6,7 
underscoring  the  importance  of  performing 
studies in China, where rates of stroke (particu-
larly hemorrhagic stroke) are high. We examined 
the association of fresh fruit consumption with 
risks  of  major  cardiovascular  events  in  China, 
where fresh fruit consumption is low, although 
fresh vegetable consumption is high.8

Methods

Study Design and Oversight
The China Kadoorie Biobank Study is a nation-
wide, prospective cohort study involving 10 di-
verse localities (regions) in China, which is jointly 
coordinated by the University of Oxford and the 
Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences. The study 
design  and  methods  have  been  reported  previ-
ously.9,10  Approval  of  the  study  was  obtained 
from  ethics  committees  or  institutional  review 
boards at the University of Oxford, the Chinese 
Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China 
CDC), the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, 
and all participating regions. The funders had 
no  role  in  study  design,  data  collection  and 
analysis, preparation of the manuscript, or the 
decision to submit it for publication.

Baseline Survey
We selected 10 regional study sites (5 urban and 
5 rural) in order to cover a wide range of risk 
exposures and disease patterns, taking into ac-
count  the  accuracy  and  completeness  of  death 
and  disease  registries  for  each  region  and  the 
local  capability  to  gather  the  necessary  study 
data. Between June 2004 and July 2008, all non-
disabled,  permanent  residents  of  each  region 
who were 35 to 74 years of age were invited to 
participate in the study. Of the total of approxi-
mately  1.8  million  eligible  adults  in  these  re-
gions, almost 1 in 3 (33% in rural areas and 27% 
in  urban  areas)  responded.  Overall,  512,891 
persons  were  recruited,  including  a  few  who 
were just outside the targeted age range, and all 
provided written informed consent.

At  the  local  study  clinics,  trained  health 
workers  administered  a  laptop-based  question-
naire on sociodemographic characteristics, smok-
ing and alcohol consumption, diet, physical ac-
tivity,  and  medical  history;  measured  height, 
weight,  waist  circumference,  and  blood  pres-
sure; and performed spot random blood glucose 
testing using the SureStep Plus System (Johnson 
&  Johnson).  Blood  pressure  was  measured  at 
least twice with the use of an automated digital 
blood-pressure  monitor  (model  UA-779,  A&D 
Medical)  after  at  least  5  minutes  of  rest  in  a 
seated  position;  the  mean  of  two  satisfactory 
measurements was used for analyses.11,12

Dietary  data  covered  12  major  food  groups: 
rice,  wheat  products,  other  staple  foods,  meat, 
poultry, fish, eggs, dairy products, fresh vegeta-
bles, preserved vegetables, fresh fruit, and soy-
bean  products.  Respondents  were  asked  about 
the  frequency  of  habitual  consumption  during 
the previous 12 months and chose among five 
categories  of  frequency  (daily,  4  to  6  days  per 
week, 1 to 3 days per week, monthly, or never or 
rarely [the reference category]). In a subsample 
of  926  participants,  the  survey  questionnaire 
was repeated within a year after the baseline as-
sessment (mean interval, 5.4 months) in order to 
assess the reproducibility of the responses.

Resurveys
After completion of the baseline survey, we ran-
domly selected 5 to 6% of the original partici-
pants for two resurveys, using procedures simi-
lar to those at baseline. The first resurvey took

place  from  July  through  October  2008,  with 
19,788  participants  resurveyed,  and  the  second 
was conducted from August 2013 through Sep-
tember 2014, with just over 25,000 participants 
resurveyed.  In  addition  to  questions  about  the 
frequency of consumption, the second resurvey 
questionnaire asked about the amount consumed 
for each food group, which was used as a proxy 
measure to estimate the average consumption at 
baseline for each of the five frequency categories 
(see the Supplementary Appendix, available with 
the full text of this article at NEJM.org).

Follow-up and Outcome Measures
The  vital  status  of  each  participant  was  deter-
mined periodically through the Disease Surveil-
lance Points (DSP) system of the China CDC.13 
The DSP vital-status data sets were checked an-
nually against local residential records and health 
insurance  records  and  were  confirmed  with 
street committees or village administrators. In 
addition, information about major diseases and 
episodes of hospitalization was collected through 
linkages with disease registries (for cancer, car-
diovascular disease, and diabetes) and national 
health insurance claims databases. The Chinese 
National Health Insurance scheme provides elec-
tronic linkage to all hospitalization data.

Fatal  and  nonfatal  events  were  documented 
according  to  the  International Classification of Dis-
eases, 10th Revision (ICD-10), by coders who were 
unaware  of  the  baseline  characteristics  of  the 
study  participants.10  The  four  main  outcome 
measures that were examined were cardiovascu-
lar death (ICD-10 codes I00 to I25, I27 to I88, 
and I95 to I99) and the incidence of major coro-
nary events (fatal ischemic heart disease [codes 
I20 to I25] plus nonfatal myocardial infarction 
[code I21]), hemorrhagic stroke (code I61), and 
ischemic stroke (code I63). Other ischemic heart 
disease (i.e., ischemic heart disease not meeting 
the  criteria  for  a  major  coronary  event)  and 
other  cerebrovascular  diseases  (ICD-10  codes 
I60,  I62,  and  I64  to  I69)  were  analyzed  sepa-
rately. For analyses of incident disease, only the 
first cardiovascular event was counted.

Statistical Analysis
For the current study, we excluded persons who 
had a history of cardiovascular disease (23,132 
persons)  or  antihypertensive  treatment  (48,174 
persons) at baseline. Baseline characteristics of 

the  remaining  451,665  participants  were  de-
scribed  as  means  and  standard  deviations  or 
percentages in each category of fruit consump-
tion, with adjustment for age, sex, and region as 
appropriate, by means of either multiple linear 
regression (for continuous outcomes) or logistic 
regression (for binary outcomes). The marginal 
mean  values  and  95%  confidence  intervals  for 
body-mass  index  (BMI),  waist  circumference, 
blood pressure, and blood glucose according to 
frequency of fruit consumption were estimated 
separately for men and women with the use of 
multiple  linear  regression  models  adjusted  for 
baseline covariates.

Cox regression was used to calculate hazard 
ratios and 95% confidence intervals for relative 
risks in relation to fruit consumption, with ad-
justment for baseline covariates and with strati-
fication according to age at risk (in 5-year inter-
vals),  sex,  and  region.  For  analyses  involving 
more than two exposure categories, the floating-
absolute-risk method was used, which provides 
the variance of the logarithm of the hazard ratio 
(i.e., to compute a confidence interval for the 
hazard  ratio)  for  each  category  (including  the 
reference  category)  to  facilitate  comparisons 
among the different exposure categories.14 Con-
ventional  (unfloated)  analyses  were  also  per-
formed so that the results of the two methods 
could  be  compared.  We  calculated  the  hazard 
ratio for cardiovascular death with nondaily fruit 
consumption as compared with daily consumption 
in order to estimate the population-attributable 
fraction,  using  the  formula  Pe(HR − 1) ÷ [Pe(HR 
− 1) + 1],15 where Pe is the prevalence of nondaily 
consumption of fresh fruit in the Chinese popu-
lation, and HR is the hazard ratio. Additional 
information  about  the  statistical  analyses  is 
provided in the Supplementary Appendix.

Patterns of Fresh Fruit Consumption
Among the 451,665 participants included in the 
study, the mean age was 50.5 years (range, 30 to 
79); 58.8% of the participants were women, and 
42.5% were from urban areas (Table 1). Overall, 
18.0% of participants reported consumption of 
fresh fruit on a daily basis, 9.4% reported con-
sumption  4  to  6  days  per  week,  and  6.3%  re-
ported no or rare consumption (also referred to as 
nonconsumption). The proportion of participants

age among rural participants and urban women 
(Fig. S1 and S2 in the Supplementary Appendix). 
Among urban men, however, the association was 
U-shaped, with men who were 50 to 55 years of 
age  (preretirement  age  in  China)  reporting  the 
lowest  consumption.  There  was  no  south-to-
north  gradient  in  fruit  consumption,  with  two 

urban  areas  (Qingdao  and  Harbin)  having  the 
highest consumption and two rural areas (Henan 
and Hunan) having the lowest consumption (Fig. 
S3 in the Supplementary Appendix). The Spear-
man correlation coefficient of 0.55 between re-
sponses a few months apart indicated moderate 
reliability  of  the  measure  of  fruit-consumption 
frequency  (Table  S2  in  the  Supplementary  Ap-
pendix).

Participants who consumed fresh fruit more 
frequently  (as  compared  with  those  who  con-
sumed it less frequently) were more likely to be 
women and to live in urban areas, were younger, 
had  a  higher  level  of  education  and  higher 
household income, and were less likely to smoke 
or  drink  alcohol  regularly  and  more  likely  to 
consume dairy products and meat, but they had 
similar levels of consumption of preserved and 
fresh vegetables (Table 1). Our participants had an 
overall mean BMI (the weight in kilograms divided 
by the square of the height in meters) of 23.5 
and  overall  mean  systolic  blood  pressure  of 
128.8  mm  Hg.  As  compared  with  participants 
who never or rarely consumed fresh fruit, the 
BMI of daily consumers was 0.5 points higher, 
the waist circumference 0.9 cm larger, the blood 
pressure 4.0 mm Hg systolic lower and 1.4 mm Hg 
diastolic  lower,  and  the  blood  glucose  level 
0.5  mmol per liter (9.0 mg per deciliter) lower 
(Fig. 1). These associations were largely unchanged 
after  additional  adjustment  for  potential  con-
founders or mediators, except for systolic blood 
pressure, for which the association was attenu-
ated by about one fifth (to 3.3 mm Hg in men 
and to 2.2 mm Hg in women).

Association of Fruit Consumption  
with Cardiovascular Outcomes
During  3.2  million  person-years  of  follow-up, 
there were 5173 cardiovascular deaths, 2551 ma-
jor coronary events (plus 16,563 other ischemic 
heart  disease  events),  14,579  ischemic  strokes, 
and 3523 hemorrhagic strokes (plus 11,054 other 
cerebrovascular  disease  events)  recorded.  The 
risks of these major cardiovascular events were 
strongly and inversely associated with the level 
of fruit consumption (P<0.001 for trend, for all 
comparisons) (Fig. 2 and Table 2). As compared 
with  nonconsumption,  the  adjusted  hazard  ra-
tios for daily consumption were 0.60 (95% con-
fidence interval [CI], 0.54 to 0.67) for cardiovas-
cular death, 0.66 (95% CI, 0.58 to 0.75) for major 
coronary events, 0.75 (95% CI, 0.72 to 0.79) for 
ischemic stroke, and 0.64 (95% CI, 0.56 to 0.74) 
for hemorrhagic stroke. After correction for re-
gression  dilution  bias,  the  associations  were 
approximately  log-linear;  the  hazard  ratios  for 
one daily portion of fruit were 0.63 (95% CI, 0.56 
to 0.72), 0.70 (95% CI, 0.60 to 0.83), 0.80 (95% 
CI, 0.75 to 0.85), and 0.69 (95% CI, 0.59 to 0.81), 
respectively. The level of fruit consumption was 

also significantly and inversely associated with 
risks of other ischemic heart disease and other 
cerebrovascular  diseases,  although  the  associa-
tions were less strong (Table  2, and Fig. S4 in 
the Supplementary Appendix).

With  the  exception  of  ischemic  stroke  and 
other cerebrovascular diseases, the associations 
between the level of fruit consumption and the 
risk of major cardiovascular events did not ap-
pear to be modified by baseline characteristics 
such as sex, age, region, or season of enrollment 
(Fig. 3, and Fig. S5 through S8 in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix). For ischemic stroke, the associa-
tion  appeared  to  be  somewhat  greater  among 
men, participants from urban areas, those who 
drank alcohol regularly, those with higher edu-
cational  levels,  and  those  with  higher  blood 
glucose levels (Fig. S5 in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix). None of the associations or interactions 
were materially attenuated by additional adjust-
ment for BMI, waist circumference, systolic blood 
pressure, and blood glucose level (Fig. S9 in the 
Supplementary Appendix).

In  our  study,  approximately  95%  of  partici-
pants reported daily consumption of fresh veg-
etables. Additional adjustment for consumption 
of  fresh  vegetables  and  other  dietary  variables 
did  not  alter  the  risk  estimates  for  fresh  fruit 
consumption  (Table  S3  in  the  Supplementary 
Appendix). Likewise, the exclusion of the first 
2 years of follow-up in order to further reduce 
the effect of reverse causality did not materially 
change  the  observed  associations  (data  not 
shown).

Population-Attributable Fraction  
of Low Fruit Consumption
The hazard ratio for cardiovascular death with 
nondaily versus daily fruit consumption was 1.30 
(95% CI, 1.17 to 1.46). In our second resurvey, 
about 65% of the participants reported nondaily 
fruit consumption (Table S4 in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix), which was in line with the pro-
portion  in  the  most  recent  China  Health  and 
Nutrition  Survey,  conducted  in  2011.16  We  per-
formed an exploratory analysis to estimate the 
effect  of  fruit  consumption  on  cardiovascular 
death  under  the  assumption  that  there  is  a 
causal association. On the basis of this assump-
tion, our data suggest that 16% (95% CI, 10 to 
23) of deaths from cardiovascular causes could 
be attributed to low fruit consumption. Applying

Figure 1. Adjusted Mean Body-Mass Index (BMI), Waist Circumference, Blood Pressure, and Blood Glucose According to 
the Frequency of Fresh Fruit Consumption.
Mean values for BMI (Panel A) and waist circumference (Panel B) were adjusted for age (10 categories), area of China 
(10 regions), educational level (4 categories), annual household income (4 categories), smoking status (4 categories, 
with the category of “Never” subdivided into “Never” and “Occasional”), alcohol intake (4 categories, with the cate-
gory of “Never” subdivided into “Never” and “Occasional”), physical activity (continuous variable), survey season 
(4 categories), and consumption of meat (3 categories), dairy products (3 categories), and preserved vegetables  
(5 categories). Mean values for systolic blood pressure (Panel C) and random blood glucose measurements (Panel D) 
were adjusted for the listed variables plus BMI and waist circumference. Blood glucose values were missing for 7503 
study participants. To convert the values for glucose to milligrams per deciliter, divide by 0.05551. Vertical lines indi-
cate 95% confidence intervals. P<0.001 for trend, for all comparisons.

this proportion to national data on cardiovascu-
lar mortality17 suggests that about 560,000 (95% 
CI, 350,000 to 800,000) deaths from cardiovas-
cular causes each year, including about 200,000 
before  70  years  of  age,  could  be  prevented  if 

daily consumption of fresh fruit were universal 
in  China.  However,  it  is  difficult  to  establish 
causality  reliably  in  observational  studies  of 
dietary factors that have such moderate relative 
risks and potential for confounding.

Figure 2. Adjusted Hazard Ratios for Major Cardiovascular Events According to the Level of Fresh Fruit Consumption.
Analyses were adjusted for educational level, income, alcohol intake, smoking status, physical activity, survey season, 
and consumption of dairy products, meat, and preserved vegetables and were stratified according to age at risk, sex, 
and region. The black boxes represent hazard ratios, with the size inversely proportional to the variance of the loga-
rithm of the hazard ratio, and the vertical lines represent 95% confidence intervals. The numbers above the vertical 
lines are point estimates for hazard ratios, and the numbers below the lines are numbers of events.

Discussion

In our study involving more than 450,000 men 
and women in China without prior cardiovascu-
lar disease or antihypertensive treatment, higher 
fresh  fruit  consumption  was  associated  with 
significantly lower levels of blood pressure and 
blood  glucose.  Largely  independent  of  blood 
pressure, blood glucose levels, and other dietary 
and  nondietary  factors,  higher  fruit  consump-
tion was also associated with significantly lower 

risks of cardiovascular disease, including cardio-
vascular  death,  major  coronary  events,  hemor-
rhagic stroke, and ischemic stroke. These asso-
ciations were consistent across 10 regions and in 
various  subgroups  of  participants  defined  by 
various baseline characteristics. If these associa-
tions are largely causal, the potential health gain 
from  increased  consumption  of  fresh  fruit  in 
China would be substantial.

Several  large  prospective  studies  of  mostly 
Western populations have assessed the associa-

tion  of  fruit  consumption  with  cardiovascular 
disease.18-25 Most of them showed an inverse as-
sociation, but the magnitude of the benefit var-
ied  considerably,  and  the  association  was  typi-
cally  weaker  than  that  observed  in  the  current 
study. For example, in a recent meta-analysis of 
six studies involving nearly 680,000 participants 
and 10,000 cardiovascular deaths, each additional 
serving  (80  g)  of  fruit  per  day  was  associated 
with a 5% (95% CI, 0 to 9) lower risk of cardio-
vascular death, which is not good evidence of a 
real protective effect.19 Only one previous pro-
spective study in China has shown an associa-
tion between fresh fruit consumption and car-
diovascular  risk.  In  that  study,  involving 
approximately  130,000  adults  from  Shanghai 
and approximately 1600 cardiovascular deaths 
during  follow-up,  the  risk  of  cardiovascular 
death among people in the highest quintile of 
fruit  consumption  was  about  30%  lower  than 
among  those  in  the  lowest  quintile,26  but  no 
overall association with the incidence of major 
coronary events was observed, perhaps in part 
because  of  the  small  number  of  such  events 
(365).27 Information on the association between 
fruit consumption and stroke subtypes is limit-
ed,18 especially for hemorrhagic stroke, which is 
relatively uncommon in Western populations. In 
our study, which involved more than 3500 hemor-
rhagic strokes, we found that higher consump-
tion of fresh fruit was associated with a signifi-
cantly lower risk of hemorrhagic stroke, largely 
independent of blood pressure.

Figure 3 (facing page). Adjusted Hazard Ratios for 
 Cardiovascular Death with One Daily Portion of Fresh 
Fruit, According to Baseline Characteristics.
Analyses were adjusted for educational level, income, 
alcohol intake, smoking status, physical activity, survey 
season, and consumption of dairy products, meat, and 
preserved vegetables and were stratified according to 
age at risk, sex, and region, as appropriate. The black 
boxes represent hazard ratios, with the size inversely 
proportional to the variance of the logarithm of the 
hazard ratio, and the horizontal lines represent 95% 
confidence intervals. The open diamonds represent 
the overall hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals. 
Chi-square tests (χ2) were performed to examine either 
trend (with 1 df) or heterogeneity (with n − 1 df, where 
n represents the number of categories). To convert the 
values for glucose to milligrams per deciliter, divide by 
0.05551.

The  association  between  the  level  of  fruit 
consumption  and  cardiovascular  risk  in  our 
study (a 40% lower risk of cardiovascular death 
and a 34% lower risk of major coronary events 
among participants who consumed fresh fruit 
daily  as  compared  with  those  who  never  or 
rarely consumed fresh fruit) was much stronger 
than the associations observed in previous stud-
ies. Several factors may account for this differ-
ence.  First,  unlike  many  previous  studies,  our 
study  focused  on  fresh  fruit,  which  is  univer-
sally consumed raw in China, perhaps maximiz-
ing its potential benefits.23,28 Moreover, the aver-
age  level  of  fruit  consumption  in  the  Chinese 
population  is  very  low,8  and  there  is  evidence 
that  the  association  of  fruit  consumption  with 
disease  risks  may  be  particularly  strong  at  the 
low end of the range of intake (i.e., fewer than 
two servings per day).19 In addition, our analyses 
excluded not only persons with a history of car-
diovascular disease but also those receiving anti-
hypertensive  treatment,  thereby  reducing  con-
founding  by  medication  use.  Our  analysis  also 
takes  into  account  regression  dilution  bias,29,30 
whereas previously, few large, prospective studies 
have dealt with this important issue.20

Our study has several limitations. First, we 
did not collect information on processed fruit 
because  its  consumption  is  extremely  low  in 
China. Second, we were unable to properly ex-
amine  the  association  of  fresh  vegetables  with 
cardiovascular risk because daily consumption is 
almost universal in our study population. Third, 
fruit consumption at baseline was assessed with 
the  use  of  a  simple  qualitative  food-frequency 
questionnaire,  and  information  on  mean  con-
sumption amounts was estimated indirectly on 
the basis of data from resurveys (under the as-
sumption that there were no large changes be-
tween the baseline survey and the second resur-
vey). Fourth, we did not collect information about 
types of fruit consumed, which is likely to vary 
greatly according to season and region (although 
the  most  commonly  consumed  fruits  in  China 
are  apples,  citrus  fruit,  and  pears).  Fifth,  our 
study was not exactly nationally representative, 
and  the  questionnaire  used  has  not  been  vali-
dated against another dietary measure. Finally, 
and perhaps most important, fruit consumption 
in our study was closely correlated with socio-
economic status, which in turn has been closely

associated  with  health  status  and  the  risk  of 
cardiovascular  disease.31  Although  we  adjusted 
carefully  for  several  variables  related  to  socio-
economic status (i.e., region, educational level, 
and income) and analyses stratified according to 
these  variables  showed  consistent  findings,  re-
sidual  confounding  by  socioeconomic  status  is 
still possible.

Our study does not permit reliable inference 
of causality, but the observed inverse association 
between  fruit  consumption  and  cardiovascular 
risk could be causal,32,33 given that fruit is a rich 
source of potassium, dietary fiber, folate, anti-
oxidants, and various bioactive phytochemicals, 
each of which has potential cardioprotective ef-
fects,34  and  contains  little  sodium  and  fat  and 
few calories. The association may be mediated 
through conventional cardiovascular risk factors 
such as hypertension, diabetes, and overweight.35 
However, in our relatively lean study population 
(mean  BMI,  23.5),  fruit  intake  was  associated 
with higher, instead of lower, adiposity, perhaps 
through  improved  nutrition,  since  a  stronger 
positive association was observed among those 
with  a  lower  BMI,  and  adjustment  for  blood 

pressure and blood glucose levels attenuated the 
association only slightly, suggesting the involve-
ment of other mechanisms.36

In conclusion, our evaluation of the relation-
ship between fresh fruit consumption and cardio-
vascular disease in China showed that the level 
of  fruit  consumption  was  inversely  associated 
with  blood  pressure  and  blood  glucose  levels. 
Largely  independent  of  blood  pressure,  blood 
glucose levels, and other dietary and nondietary 
factors, higher fruit consumption was associated 
with a significantly lower risk of major cardio-
vascular events.
