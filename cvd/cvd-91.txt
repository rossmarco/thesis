Background The  rapid  emergence  of  coronary  artery  disease
(CAD) in south Asian people is not explained by conventional
risk 
In  view  of  cardioprotective  effects  of  a
Mediterranean style diet rich in ␣-linolenic acid, we assessed
the benefits of this diet for patients at high risk of CAD.

factors. 

Methods We  did  a  randomised,  single-blind  trial  in  1000
patients  with  angina  pectoris,  myocardial 
infarction,  or
surrogate risk factors for CAD. 499 patients were allocated to a
diet  rich  in  whole  grains,  fruits,  vegetables,  walnuts,  and
almonds.  501  controls  consumed  a  local  diet  similar  to  the
step I National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) prudent
diet.

Findings The  intervention  group  consumed  more  fruits,
vegetables, legumes, walnuts, and almonds than did controls
(573  g  [SD  127]  vs 231  g  [19]  per  day  p<0·001).  The
intervention  group  had  an  increased  intake  of  whole  grains 
and  mustard  or  soy  bean  oil. The  mean 
intake  of 
␣-linolenic  acid  was  two-fold  greater  in  the  intervention  group
(1·8 g [SD 0·4] vs 0·8 g [0·2] per day, p<0·001). Total cardiac
end  points  were  significantly  fewer  in  the  intervention  group
than the controls (39 vs 76 events, p<0·001). Sudden cardiac
deaths  were  also  reduced  (6  vs 16,  p=0·015),  as  were  non-
fatal myocardial infarctions (21 vs 43, p<0·001). We noted a
significant  reduction  in  serum  cholesterol  concentration  and
other  risk  factors  in  both  groups,  but  especially  in  the
intervention  diet  group.  In  the  treatment  group,  patients  with
pre-existing  CAD  had  significantly  greater  benefits  compared
with such patients in the control group.

Interpretation An  Indo-Mediterranean  diet  that  is  rich  in 
␣-linolenic  acid  might  be  more  effective  in  primary  and
secondary prevention of CAD than the conventional step I NCEP
prudent diet.

Introduction
People  of  south-Asian  origin  who  live  in  developed
countries have an increased mortality rate and susceptibility
to  coronary  artery  disease  (CAD)  compared  with
indigenous populations.1–3 The prevalence of CAD is 10%
in urban dwellers, but is low in rural dwellers (3–4%) and
the lower social classes (1–3%) who consume a diet based
on  cereal.  The  risk  shows  a  graded  increase  in  urban
dwellers,  high  social  classes,  and  immigrants,  which  is
linked  to  pronounced  differences  in  diet  and  lifestyle.1,2,4,5
However, the greater susceptibility of people of south-Asian
origin to CAD is not explained by conventional risk factors,
such  as  cholesterol  and  obesity,  alone.2,3 Results  from  the
seven  countries  study6 showed  that  such  differences  in
coronary risk can be explained partly by antioxidants in the
diet, variations in physical activity, and smoking. Data from
epidemiological  and  cohort  studies7,8 also  showed  that
increased  consumption  of  fruits,  vegetables  and  legumes,
grains, nuts, and n-3 fatty acids might be associated with a
decreased risk of CAD, and deaths attributable to coronary
disease.  Results  from  randomised  controlled  intervention
trials9–14 suggest  that  treatment  with  n-3  fatty  acids  and
antioxidant  rich  foods  such  as  fish,  fruits,  vegetables,
legumes,  and  nuts  can  reduce  cardiac  events  and  related
mortality  in  patients  with  CAD.  Evidence  suggests  that
dietary  patterns  could  well  have  an  effect  on  the
mechanisms of atherosclerotic plaque vulnerability and the
progression of thrombosis.15–17

impressive  effects  on 

The scientific advisory committee of the American Heart
Association  (AHA)  has  stated  that  a  Mediterranean-style
diet  has 
the  progression  of
cardiovascular disease.13 Significant findings from the Lyon
Heart Study9,10 and other such studies,11,12 have prompted an
aggressive  pursuit  of 
the  benefits  of  such  dietary
modifications in other regions of the world.11,12,15 If the Lyon
diet  is  also  of  benefit  in  non-Mediterranean  populations,
such  as  south-Asians,  it  might  provide  an  economically
feasible  and  realistic  method  to  reduce  CAD  in  these
regions.  The  AHA  statement13 raised  some  issues  for
investigators: geographical and non-measured cultural and
social differences in potential target populations; enhanced
definition  of  baseline  diets  of  both  trial  groups  at  the
beginning of the study; enhanced and continuing analysis of
true dietary patterns throughout studies; and an assessment
of any changes in combined risk factors during the study.
We  have  addressed  some  of  these  issues  here.  In  patients
with  clinical  CAD  or  with  recognised  risk  factors,  we
assessed the effect of an Indo-Mediterranean diet consisting
of whole grains including legumes, fruits, vegetables, nuts,
and mustard or soybean oil.

diabetes  mellitus,  or  heart  attack  for  free  medical  advice
about  diagnosis  and  treatment  of  their  disorders.  Patients
were enrolled by a dietician and a physician. The diagnostic
criteria  for  these  cardiovascular  risk  factors  were  those
standardised by WHO.18 There were between 50 and 150
respondents  at  each  centre.  Most  respondents  were  from
social  class  1–3  (including  shopkeepers,  office  workers,
businessmen,  teachers,  doctors,  engineers,  and  artisans)
and had sedentary occupations.3–5 The recruitment criterion
was  one  or  more  of  the  major  risk  factors  for  CAD,18,19
(hypertension,  hypercholesterolaemia,  or  diabetes  mellitus
(418)),  or  angina  pectoris  (105)  or  a  previous  myocardial
infarction (478) in absence or presence of other risk factors.
Of 1650 people who responded to advertisements from 17
centres over 4 years, 1066 between ages 28 and 75 years,
volunteered to participate in the trial (figure 1). 

For  patients  without  a  documented  history,  we  used
exercise  electrocardiography  after  either  bicycle  ergometry
(446) or treadmill tests (76) to detect CAD. For the other
patients (478), a previous record of diagnosis and treatment
of  myocardial  infarction  was  available.  We  excluded
patients  because  of:  absence  of  major  risk  factors  (11),
cancer (7), chronic diarrhoea or dysentery (8), a blood urea
of  more  than  6·6  mmol/L  (8),  arthritis  (5),  dislike  of  the
intervention diet (12), refusal of laboratory testing, (9) and
death before randomisation (6). The  ethics committee at
the  Medical  Hospital  and  Research  Centre  at  Moradabad
approved  the  study,  and  we  obtained  written  informed
consent from all participants.

We classified patients who had a body-mass index (BMI)
between 25 and 29·9 kg/m2 as overweight, and obesity was
defined as a BMI of 30 kg/m2 or greater. We defined weight
loss  as  a  reduction  of  0·5  kg  or  greater.  Patients  who
completed  less  than  3  km  of  walking  per  day  during
occupational,  household,  or  leisure  time  activities  were

defined as physically inactive. Hypertension was diagnosed
if blood pressure was greater than 140 mm Hg systolic or 90
mm  Hg  diastolic.  Diabetes  mellitus  was  diagnosed  when
fasting  blood  glucose  concentrations  were  greater  than 
7·7 mmol/L, and postprandial concentrations were greater
than 11·1 mmol/L, 2 h after ingestion of 75 g of glucose.
Alternatively,  patients  were 
as  having
hypertension,  or  diabetes  if  a  documented  history  of  their
diagnosis  and  treatment  was  available.  Hypercholester-
olaemia was determined by a serum cholesterol greater than
5·2 mmol/L, with confirmation by a second estimation. All
patients  with  angina  pectoris  and  myocardial  infarction 
had  treatment  for  between  10  days  and  1  year,  and  a
documented  history  of  diagnosis  and 
in
accordance with criteria specified by WHO.18

Procedures
We  met  with  participants  every  week,  for  3  weeks.  To
establish  baseline  dietary  intake,  we  asked  patients  to
maintain their usual lifestyle, and to record their daily diet
and  drug  intake.  Patients  were  required  to  provide  the
weight of fruit, vegetables, and nuts consumed. Information
from  the  diaries  was  cross-checked  by  dieticians  who
questioned  patients  about  household  measures,  food
models,  and  food  portions  to  find  the  exact  quantity  of 
food  consumed.  Baseline  clinical,  electrocardiographic,
radiological,  and  laboratory  data  were  obtained  from
participants  during  the  3-week  observation.  Every  patient
was  then  individually  assessed  by  the  dietician  and  a
physician who made a final decision about eligibility for the
trial. Participants were then stratified to have a balance of
patient  characteristics  in  each  intervention  arm.  These
characteristics included serum total cholesterol greater than
5·2  mmol/L,  age  older  than  50  years,  and  history  of
myocardial  infarction  or  angina  pectoris.  Patients  were
assigned  to  either  the  intervention  or  control  group,  by
selection of a card from a pile of equal numbers of cards for
each  group.  The  intervention  group  consisted  of  499
patients, and the control group 501. Hypolipidaemic drug
treatment  was  prescribed  at  the  discretion  of  the  treating
physician.

In  both  groups,  two-thirds  of  patients  were  vegetarian.
The  remaining  third  ate  two  to  five  eggs,  and  one  to  two
portions  of  meat  a  week.  All  participants  consumed  milk,
butter, clarified butter (Indian ghee), and trans fatty acids
(vegetable  ghee  made  from  partly  hydrogenated  oils).
Vegetarian  participants  consumed  more  milk,  vegetable
ghee,  peanut  oil,  and  clarified  butter  than  did  non-
vegetarians.20 Participants  in  both  groups  were  advised  to
eat  food  substitutes  that  would  provide  a  dietary  intake
similar  to  that  recommended  by  the  National  Cholesterol
Education  Program  (NCEP)21 in  the  step  I  prudent  diet.
This diet recommends that less than 30% of energy comes
from  total  fat,  less  than  10%  from  saturated  fat,  and  that
less  than  300  mg  of  cholesterol  is  consumed  per  day.
Additionally,  patients  in  the  intervention  group  were
advised to consume at least 400–500 g of fruits, vegetables,
and  nuts  per  day,  (ie,  250–300  g  of  fruit,  125–150  g  of
vegetables, and 25–50 g of walnuts or almonds). This group
was  also  encouraged  to  eat  400–500 g  of  whole  grains,
legumes, rice, maize, and wheat) daily, as well as mustard
seed  or  soy  bean  oil,  in  three  to  four  servings  per  day, 
which 
is  consistent  with  recommendations  from  the 
Indian  Consensus  Group.19 The  aim  of  these  dietary
recommendations was to provide people in the intervention
group  with  plenty  of  phytochemicals,  antioxidants,  and 
␣-linolenic  acid  (the  major  n-3  fatty  acid  in  these  foods).
Such  recommendations  are  also  made  by  WHO22 and  the
Indian Consensus Group19 to prevent chronic diseases.

Patients  from  both  groups  were  also  advised  to  walk
briskly for a minimum of 3–4 km, or to jog intermittently for
a minimum of 10–15 minutes per day. All participants with
CAD were instructed to take sublingual nitroglycerine and
cease  exercising  in  the  event  of  chest  pain,  substantial
sweating,  weakness,  or  dyspnoea.  Smoking  and  alcohol
consumption were discouraged, and we encouraged mental
relaxation 
techniques  and
breathing  exercises  in  both  groups.  Appropriate  drugs  for
angina  pectoris,  arrhythmias,  raised  blood  pressure,
diabetes,  and  other  complications  were  provided  to  both
groups.

Data collection and follow up
We  calculated  24-h  nutrient  intakes  for  all  patients  with
Indian  food-composition  tables21 and  patients’  weekly  diet
diaries. All participants were asked to complete for 1 week a
record  of  food 
intake,  and  to  record  occupational,
household, and leisure time physical activity for weeks 1–4,
then at weeks 4, 8, 12, and 24, then at 12 week intervals, to
assess  dietary  adherence  and  exercise  activity.23 In  both
groups, completed diaries were checked by the dietician on
every  visit  with  the  help  of  a  questionnaire  that  used
household  measures  and  food  models,  to  estimate  caloric
value of food portions and to reinforce dietary adherence.
Control  patients  were  given  an  information  sheet  on  the
step I prudent diet at each visit, intervention group patients
were given a thorough explanation of the usefulness of the
experimental diet, and the types of food that are rich in n-3
fatty-acids.  At  all  meetings,  dieticians  provided  additional
motivation to both groups to adhere to the advice about diet
and exercise.

Patients with diabetes mellitus, angina pectoris, a history
of  myocardial  infarction,  or  hypertension  who  visited  the
physician frequently, received more frequent dietary advice
during  the  2  years  of  follow  up  than  those  who  did  not. 
At  every  visit,  bodyweight,  tobacco  use,  and  alcohol
consumption  were  recorded  by  the  dietician  with  a
questionnaire, which was identical for both groups.

In both groups, clinical data, drug intake, adverse events,
coronary events, hospital admission, blood pressure, blood
glucose,  and  blood  lipids  were  recorded  by  a  physician
unaware of patient diet. A 12-lead electrocardiograph was
done every 3 months for patients with CAD and for people
with  any  symptoms  or  signs  suggestive  of  cardiac
arrhythmias,  heart  enlargement,  ischaemia,  or  infarction.
Routine annual electrocardiography was done for all other
participants. Patients recorded symptoms of angina pectoris
in  a  diary.  Chronic  left  ventricular  failure,  ventricular
hypertrophy, dysrhythmias, and positive exercise tests were
diagnosed  in  accordance  with  standard  criteria,  including
those  of  the  New  York  Heart  Association  (NYHA  class
II–IV).

Cardiovascular events
The principal endpoints of the study were fatal or non-fatal
myocardial  infarctions,  sudden  cardiac  deaths,  and  the
combined  total  of  these  events.18 Other  important  events,
such as the need for coronary angiography, angioplasty, or
bypass  surgery  were  also  recorded  by  a  cardiologist,  from
whom the dietary regimens were concealed.

Fatal  myocardial  infarction  was  diagnosed  when  a
hospital  record  was  consistent  with  cause  of  death,  and
there  was  either  preterminal  hospital  admission  with  a
definite  myocardial  infarction,  or  a  record  in  which
myocardial infarction had been noted. We classified sudden
cardiac death when coronary heart disease had been noted,
and  death  occurred  within  1  h  of  onset  of  symptoms.  A
death  certificate  in  which  background  CAD  had  been

noted,  but  not  evidence  that  was  suggestive  of  a  cardiac
death, was classified as a suspected cardiac death. Non-fatal
myocardial  infarction  in  inpatients  was  diagnosed  if  a
diagnostic electrocardiograph had been done at the time of
the event; or if the patient had had ischaemic cardiac pain
and  diagnostic  enzyme  measurements  (creatine  kinase,
lactate  dehydrogenase,  or  serum  glutamic  oxalotransferase
of  at  least  twice  the  higher  limit  of  normal),  or  had  had
ischaemic cardiac pain and equivocal enzyme measurement
and  an  equivocal  electrocardiograph.  The  diagnosis 
of  myocardial  infarction  was  also  considered  in  patients 
who  had  not  been  admitted  if  they  had  chest  pain,
breathlessness, 
diagnostic
electrocardiograph  at 
time  of  event,  or  new
electrocardiographic  changes  consistent  with  myocardial
infarction  at  routine  check-up.  A  cardiologist  who  did 
not  have  clinical  information  about  the  dietary  regimens 
did the electrocardiographic coding and analysis.21 Possible
myocardial  infarction  was  suspected  in  the  presence  of

Statistical analysis
We  calculated  sample  size  on  the  basis  of  a  difference
between  the  two  groups  in  the  total  number  of  cardiac
events,  assuming  a  14%  risk  in  the  control  group,  an  8%
risk in the intervention group, a power of 85%, and a two-
tailed test with ␣=0·05. We estimated the risks in groups  on
the basis of previous data,11 and expected a reduced rate of
events    because  of  preventive  measures  taken  in  both
control and intervention groups.

Data were analysed by intention to treat. We did baseline
comparisons using a t test for continuous variables and a ␹2
test  for  binary  variables.  Comparison  of  risk  factors  and
nutrient intakes after 2 years were done by a test based on
the values at the end of follow-up, as well as a t test based on
differences  from  baseline.  These  differences  were  assessed
twice:  first,  we  included  all  patients  and  used  the  last
available  records  of  patients  who  were  lost  to  follow-up,
and, second, we did an analysis which omitted patients lost
to follow-up. Results of the two analyses did not differ, and
data  are  therefore  shown  for  the  analysis  that  includes  all
patients.  Event-free  survival  for  each  endpoint  and  the
composite outcome of all cardiac events were estimated by
the  Kaplan-Meier  method.  We  estimated  rate  ratios  with

Results
Participants  (n=1000)    were  randomly  assigned  to  the
intervention  diet  (499)  or  control  diet  (501).  Because
patients were stratified by risk factor or presence of CAD,
both  groups  were  comparable  for  over  30  characteristics,
including  complications  (table  1).  Hypertension  was  a
common risk factor in both groups. Hypercholesterolaemia
was  much  the  same  in  the  two  groups,  and  for  most
patients  serum  cholesterol  was  between  5·2–6·7  mmol/L.
In both groups, roughly half the patients were smokers at
entry  to  the  study.  Frequencies  of  therapeutic  drug  use
were  closely  similar  in  both  groups.  The  proportions  of
patients with a sedentary lifestyle were almost identical at
baseline  in  both  groups  (450  [90%]  vs 462  [90%])  for
intervention and control groups, respectively). All patients
with  diabetes  mellitus  received    either  glybenclamide  or
glipizide.  More  than  half  the  patients  in  each  group  had
CAD  at  baseline,  defined  as  angina  pectoris  or  a  past
myocardial  infarction.  A  third  of  participants  in  both
groups had had a myocardial infarction within the previous
4  weeks.  Other  complications  of  CAD  with  a  poor 
long-term  prognosis  were  slightly  more  common  in  the
intervention group  than in controls.

participants’  homes,  and  because  Indians  prefer  non-

dropouts  in  the  intervention  group  and  11  in  the  control
group, all of which happened after 12 weeks of follow-up.
Apart from these dropouts, 115 patients in the intervention

they  were adhering to the diet and lifestyle changes that we
recommended  (data  not  shown).  Dietary  intake  of  fruit,
vegetables, legumes, and oils increased in both groups but
much  more  so  in  the  intervention  group,  suggesting  that
participants adhered to the recommended diets (table 2).

(data not shown).

Baseline  nutrient

important differences in the consumption of carbohydrates,
fatty  acids,  and  cholesterol  between  the  two  groups 
(table 2). At the end of the 2-year follow-up, n-3 fatty acid

the  intervention  diet.  Intake  of  dietary  fibre,  salt,  fruit,
vegetable,  nut,  and  whole  grains  between  the  groups  was
much the same at baseline, but after 2 years,  patients on the
intervention diet consumed a greater percentage of calories

polyunsaturated  to  saturated  fat  ratio,  and  lower  energy,

After  2  years,  both  groups  had  a  significant  decrease  in

group, but fell in controls. Fasting blood glucose, BMI, and
blood pressures were significantly reduced in those on the

smoking in the two groups was significant.

At 2 years of follow-up, the intervention group, compared

The intervention group had a significant reduction in risk
of  non-fatal  myocardial  infarction,  sudden  cardiac  death,
and  total  cardiac  endpoints  compared  with  the  controls
(table 4). There were also fewer, but not significantly fewer,
fatal myocardial infarctions.  Suspected cardiac deaths (two
in  the  intervention  group,  one  in  the  controls)  were  not
included in the analysis, although their inclusion in the total
cardiac  end  points  did  not  change  the  results  significantly
(data not shown). Kaplan-Meier analysis of curve for event-
free  survival  for  total  cardiac  endpoints  suggests    a  highly
beneficial effect of the intervention diet (figure 2). With the
Cox’s proportional-hazards model, rates for cardiac events
were  estimated  for  the  intervention  group  relative  to  the
controls,  after  we  had  adjusted  for  age,  sex,  BMI,

Pre-existing coronary artery disease (angina pectoris and
myocardial  infarction),  hypertension,  or  hypercholester-
olaemia  at  baseline  did  not  determine  the  effect  of  the
intervention. We have tested interactions with respect to all
these risk factors and none was significant (data not shown). 

Discussion
Our  results  show 
that  consumption  of  an  Indo-
Mediterranean  diet  rich  in  ␣-linolenic  acid  was  associated
with  a  significant  reduction 
in  non-fatal  myocardial
infarction,  sudden  cardiac  death,  and  total  cardiac
endpoints.  Additionally,  the  intervention  diet  showed
improvements  in  the  number  of  surrogate  traditional  risk
factors, which were better than those seen in controls who
adhered to the prudent step I diet.

The intervention diet was based on that suggested by the
scientific  advisory  committee  of  the  AHA,13 WHO,  and
other  studies.9,10,12,22,26 The  Indo-Mediterranean  Diet  Heart
Study has shown that many lacto-vegetarian and sedentary
patients  with  major  cardiac  risk  factors,  and  those  with
CAD, can be motivated to make comprehensive dietary and
lifestyle  changes  over  at  least  2  years.  Our  intervention
programme  seems  to  be  a  safe  adjunct  to  the  prudent 
diet,  and  is  compatible  with  other  treatments  given
simultaneously, such as physical activity and medications. 

The prevalence of CAD is low in rural dwelling Indians,
when compared with urban dwellers and immigrant Indians
(3%,  10%,  14%,  respectively).1-3 Rural  populations  at  low
risk  consume  300–500 g  per  day  of  whole  grains,  such  as
wheat, rice, millet, and pulses, and mustard oil as visible fat
(rich  in  n-3  fatty  acids).1–5 However,  urban  dwellers  and
immigrants substitute potato and refined carbohydrates for
grains, and use proatherogenic vegetable ghee and clarified
butter in place of oils. The increased susceptibility of south
Asians to CAD is not explained only by serum cholesterol,
lifestyle,  or  smoking.  Indian

which might be worse in people who consume a diet high in
polyunsaturated fat (including n-3 fatty acid), in smokers,
or in those who eat a lot of Indian ghee28 (cholesterol oxide),
thus increasing the risk of CAD in several ways.

and 

Platelet  adhesion,  which  is  important  in  thrombosis,  is
likely to occur when antioxidant and n-3 fatty acid status is
low. Arterial endothelium, myocardium, and pancreatic ␤-
cells  are  all  protected  against  free  radical  damage  by  a
combination  of  dietary  n-3  fatty  acids  and  antioxidants.27
Oxidised  blood  lipids  are  proinflammatory  and,  in  the
presence  of  low  n-3  fatty  acids,  might  also  increase
thrombosis.  Increased  consumption  of  fruits,  vegetables,
legumes,  and  nuts,  rich  sources  of  n-3  fatty  acids,
antioxidant vitamins, flavonoids, and polyphenols, could be
beneficial through some of these mechanisms. 

Results  from  the  Lyon  Diet  Heart  study9,10 showed  that
increased consumption of fruits, vegetables, nuts, and n-3
fatty  acid-rich  margarine  was  associated  with  an  almost
70%  reduction  in  coronary  events  and  cardiac  deaths
without a decrease in serum cholesterol, triglycerides, or an
increase 
in  HDL  cholesterol.  Results  of  the  Indian
Experiment on Infarct Survival study11 showed a significant
fall  in  the  number  of  cardiac  events  and  deaths  after
increased intake of fruits and vegetables in patients who had
had  a  recent  myocardial  infarction.  However,  results  of
many early trials of diet for secondary prevention of CAD
failed to show any benefits.29,30

Since  most  recent  intervention  trials31,32 of  antioxidant
vitamin supplements in the prevention of CAD have shown
little or no benefit, other phytochemicals present in whole

grains, fruits, vegetables, nuts, and oils might interact with
vitamins  in  the  prevention  of  CAD.  These  were  the
conclusions of the Indian Experiment of Infarct Survival.33
Support  for  this  view  comes  from  results  of  long-term
follow-up  studies.6,7 Results  of  an  intervention  trial  in 
120 000  people,  showed  that  daily  consumption  of  fresh
fruit  and  vegetables  was  protective  against  coronary  heart
disease.7

The  AHA  expert  panel13 has  raised  important  issues
about  baseline  dietary  intakes  and  sociocultural  factors  of
target  populations,  some  of  which  we  have  addressed  to
confirm  the  applicability  of  the  Mediterranean  diet  in  the
prevention of CAD in a geographically different population.
Investigators  in  the  Lyon  study  and  a  previous  Indian
experiment  did  not  emphasise  the  consumption  of  whole
grains, although the diets did include such measures.9–12 The
NCEP step I and II diets are characterised by low amounts
of total and saturated fats, and cholesterol, and a high intake
of fruits, vegetables, and whole grain products. These diets
have been widely recommended for treatment of CAD.20

Our study targeted populations that have yet to learn the
messages for prevention of heart disease. Baseline diets in
our  participants  contained  large  amounts  of  total  and
saturated fats, cholesterol, and refined carbohydrates in the
form  of  excess  milk,  clarified  butter,  butter,  cream,  eggs,
sugar,  refined  bread  and  small  amounts  of  whole  grain
products,  compared  with 
low-risk  rural  populations.
Dietary supplementation with wheat, rice, maize, legumes,
fruits, vegetables, and nuts was associated with a decrease in
cardiovascular  risk  factors  in  the  intervention  group.
Substantial  enhancement  of  the  effectiveness  of  dietary
recommendations20 might  be  provided  by 
integrating
features of our study diet and the Lyon Diet Heart Study.

Several  methodological  issues  in  our  study  should  be
addressed. Participant adherence to diet and lifestyle advice
is a major difficulty. Patients might not eat and do as they
are advised, and they might have learnt to complete weekly
diaries  in  accordance  with  the  perceived  wishes  of  the
dietician.  Thus,  assessment  of  nutrient  intakes  through
diaries and questionnaires is open to bias. However, in our
study,  weekly  diet  diaries  were  cross-checked  by  the
dietician’s  questionnaire.  Participants  were  heterogeneous
with  respect  to  risk  factors  for  CAD,  which  might  be
regarded  as  a  weakness.  However,  we  believe  that  this
feature might indeed be a strength, because the population
would be representative of patients typically encountered in
practice.  A  similar  study  population  was  also  used  in  the
HOPE study.32

The  benefits  noted  in  our  study  were  also  present  in
patients with pre-existing CAD, indicating that the diet was
an important help in secondary prevention. The duration of
intervention  and  the  sample  size  would  have  to  be  larger
than those in our study to draw definite conclusions about
the  effect  of  the  intervention  on  non-cardiac  and  total
mortality.

Although multiple interventions that aim to reduce CAD
might  be  criticised  for  being  methodologically  weak
(because assessment of the effect of each one separately is
difficult), the potential benefits of this approach justifies its
evaluation  as  a  way  to  decrease  CAD  incidence  and
mortality.  Further  analyses  of  our  data  are  being  done  to
determine the relative contributions of different antioxidant
vitamins, flavonoids, and polyunsaturated fatty acids34 to the
incidence  and  total  mortality  attributable  to  CAD.35
However, our study provides important lessons about diet
and  cardiovascular  disease.  First,  CAD  is  seen  in  Asia
despite an absence of conventional risk factors, and despite
the consumption of a low fat (<30% energy) diet. Second,
Asian populations are mainly vegetarian and do not have a

high  prevalence  of  obesity  or  insulin  resistance  syndrome.
Therefore,  dietary  interventions  might  be  considered  of
little  benefit  in  the  treatment  of  CAD.  Third,  we  have
shown that a diet rich in fruit, vegetables, legumes, with a
high ␣-linolenic acid content is associated with a decrease in
cardiovascular events. Fourth, n-3 fatty acids consumed as
mustard or soy bean oils, walnuts, whole grains, and leafy
vegetables, rather than as fish or fish oil supplements, might
also  reduce  the  cardiovascular  disease  risk  in  populations
that  already  consume  a  prudent,  low  fat  diet.  Fifth,  the
Indo-Mediterranean  diet  is  a  safe  and  economical  way  to
improve the health of poor populations because the whole
grains,  fruits,  vegetables,  and  oils  used  in  this  study  were
seasonal, traditional, and produced by farmers at a cost of
about  US$1  per  day.  Last,  our  trial  in  a  non-Western
population  has  shown  that,  over  2  years,  a  diet  enriched
with  fruit,  vegetables,  nuts,  whole  grains,  and  mustard  or
soy  bean  oil  is  associated  with  a  pronounced  decline  in
CAD morbidity and mortality, without an increase in non-
cardiac deaths, and in the presence of improved metabolic
profiles.  The  long-term  benefits  may  be  even  more
substantial.
