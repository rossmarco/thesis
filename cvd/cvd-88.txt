This editorial summarizes the recent American Heart

Association (AHA) Science Advisory on soy protein
and isoflavones (phytoestrogens) published in the
February 21, 2006, issue of Circulation.1 Soy protein and
isoflavones have gained considerable attention for their po-
tential role in improving risk factors for cardiovascular
disease. This scientific advisory report assesses the more
recent work published on soy protein and its component
isoflavones. In 22 randomized trials, isolated soy protein with
isoflavones compared with milk or other proteins decreased
LDL cholesterol concentrations in most studies; the average
effect was approximately 3%. This reduction is very small
compared with the large amount of soy protein tested in these
studies, averaging 50 g, approximately half the usual total
daily protein intake. No significant effects were evident on
HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, lipoprotein(a), or blood pres-
sure. Among 19 studies of soy isoflavones, the average effect
on LDL cholesterol and other lipid risk factors was nil. Soy
protein or isoflavones have not been shown to lessen vaso-
motor symptoms of menopause, and results are mixed regard-
ing slowing of postmenopausal bone loss. The efficacy and
safety of soy isoflavones for preventing or treating cancer of
the breast, endometrium, and prostate are not established;
evidence from clinical trials is meager and cautionary as
regards a possible adverse effect. For this reason, use of
isoflavone supplements in food or pills is not recommended.
Thus, earlier research indicating that soy protein compared
with other proteins has clinically important favorable effects
has not enjoyed confirmation. In contrast, many soy products
should be beneficial to cardiovascular and overall health
because of their high content of polyunsaturated fats, fiber,
vitamins, and minerals and low content of saturated fat.

In October 1999, the US Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) approved labeling for foods containing soy protein as
protective against coronary heart disease.2 The FDA based
this decision on clinical studies showing that at least 25 g soy
protein per day lowered total and LDL cholesterol. The FDA
requires for the claim that a serving contain at least 6.25 g soy
protein, 25% of the necessary daily amount, 25 g, expecting
that foods containing soy protein would be eaten at least 4
times per day. The FDA also stated, “the evidence did not
support a significant role for soy isoflavones in cholesterol-
lowering effects of soy protein.”

In 2000, the AHA Nutrition Committee released a scien-
tific advisory on soy protein and CVD.3 Since then, many
well-controlled studies on soy protein and soy-derived isofla-
vones substantially added to the knowledge base. This scien-
tific advisory report assesses the more recent work published
on soy protein and its component isoflavones, focusing on
blood LDL cholesterol and other cardiovascular disease risk
factors, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, lipoprotein(a), and
blood pressure. The medical literature was searched compre-
hensively for original research publications on the effects of
soy protein or isoflavones on cardiovascular disease risk
factors, and all controlled trials that separately listed soy
protein and isoflavone content were used. Most studies
exchanged soy protein for other dietary proteins, and this
evidence is evaluated in this report. Much less is known about
the potential impact on risk factors for CVD of increasing
total protein intake by adding soy or other plant protein in
place of carbohydrate or fat; this important dietary change is
currently being studied.

Animal proteins raise blood cholesterol concentrations in
several animal species fed cholesterol-free semi-synthetic
diets.4,5 Casein, the most prevalent protein in milk, has been
the most often used, although other animal proteins such as
pork and beef protein do the same. In contrast, when soy
protein is substituted for the animal protein, hypercholester-
olemia does not occur. Diets similar to those eaten by
humans, based on either soy protein or casein, were fed to
rabbits, and casein produced hypercholesterolemia as expect-
ed.6 However, when the same diets were fed to healthy
people, the protein source did not affect blood cholesterol.6,7
In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Sirtori and colleagues
found that diets high in soy protein, replacing nearly all the
animal protein, substantially reduced blood cholesterol by
20% to 30% in severe hypercholesterolemia.8 Because the
soy protein diets were also reduced in saturated fat and
cholesterol and increased in polyunsaturated fat, and because

the patients also often lost weight on the dietary protocols, the
results were often confounded.

A meta-analysis published in 1995 found a trend that soy
protein selectively reduced blood cholesterol in direct pro-
portion to the degree of hypercholesterolemia.9 For example,
in those with severely elevated blood cholesterol (⬎335
mg/dL), soy protein reduced blood cholesterol by 20%, but if
the initial blood cholesterol was ⬍255 mg/dL, there was no
significant effect. This meta-analysis was limited by the
quality of the studies; studies were less well-controlled in
people with hypercholesterolemia than in those with average
cholesterol levels.

Effects of Soy Protein with Isoflavones

The 3 major isoflavones found in soybeans are genistin,
daidzin, and glycitin. Their abundance in soy protein prepa-
rations varies widely and depends on the processing tech-
niques used during production.10,11 These compounds have
both estrogenic and antiestrogenic activity12,13 and effects that
are unrelated to estrogen activity.14 Because the possibility
was recognized that
isoflavones could be the bioactive
component attributed to soy protein, studies published in the
late 1990s and beyond generally stated the amount and type
of isoflavones in the soy protein. In 22 randomized trials,
isolated soy protein with isoflavones was compared with
casein or milk protein,15–32 wheat protein,33 or mixed animal
proteins.34 –36 The range of soy protein was 25 to 135 g per
day, and of isoflavones 40 to 318 mg. LDL or non-HDL
cholesterol concentrations decreased in most studies, statisti-
cally significantly in 6, with an overall effect of ⬇3%
(weighted average). A recent meta-analysis that included 10
studies published from 1995 to 2002 found a similar percent-
age reduction in LDL cholesterol with no dose effect.37 Over
all studies listed in Table 1 in the Advisory statement by
Sacks et al1, there is no apparent dose effect; the 8 studies
with soy protein 50 g or more showed a similar drop in LDL
cholesterol concentration to those using a smaller amount of
soy, ⬇3% overall. This cut point for daily soy protein intake,
50 g, defines a large amount, half or more of the daily average
total protein intake in the US. No significant effects were
evident on HDL cholesterol or triglycerides in most of the
studies; the weighted average effects were very small, ⫹1.5%
for HDL cholesterol and ⫺5% for triglycerides.

Soy Protein Without Isoflavones

Soy protein, from which isoflavones were removed, was
studied in 7 trials, and compared with casein or milk
protein,15,19,25,29,38 or various animal proteins35,36 (see Table 2
in Sacks et al1). Two of the studies showed small significant
decreases in LDL cholesterol.35,36 These studies were very
carefully controlled feeding studies, all meals being formu-
lated according to strict nutritional specifications, and com-
plete meals were provided to the participants. They were
specifically designed to sort out the effects of the protein from
the isoflavones, and showed an effect of protein but not
isoflavones on LDL cholesterol. The declines in LDL cho-
lesterol were small, 2% to 7%, relative to the large amounts
of soy protein eaten daily, 50 to 55 g. However, other
well-controlled studies did not find significant effects of soy

protein on LDL cholesterol,15,19,25,29,38 and the average
change across all 7 studies is only a 1% to 2% decrease.
Changes generally were small in HDL cholesterol and tri-
glycerides, and nonsignificant in 6 of the 7 trials. No dose
effect is evident.

Isoflavone Effects

Some studies compared soy protein that did or did not contain
isoflavones,15,16,19,25,29,35,36,38,39 – 43 whereas other studies
tested isoflavones in pill form compared with placebo44 – 49
(see Table 3 in Sacks et al1). A wide range of isoflavone
amounts were studied. One study compared the effect of
isoflavones provided with either soy or animal proteins.35
Among these 19 studies, only 3 showed significant reduction
in LDL cholesterol concentration,38,41,42 and the effect among
all studies (weighted average) was nil, 0%. Changes in HDL
cholesterol and triglycerides were not significant and showed
no trend toward an effect of isoflavones. Despite large
increases in blood isoflavone concentrations,
there is no
indication of a dose effect on blood lipids. A recent meta-
analysis concluded that isoflavones do not affect blood lipid
concentrations.37

Influence of Initial Blood
LDL-Cholesterol Level

Lichtenstein et al35 and Crouse et al15 found slightly more
LDL cholesterol reduction in people with LDL cholesterol
above 160 to 164 mg/dL than with lower levels, although
Dent et al19 did not find an effect in women with hypercho-
lesterolemia compared with average cholesterol. However, a
larger percentage reduction in LDL cholesterol in hypercho-
lesterolemia is not evident among the 22 recent trials (Table
1, Sacks et al1). Among studies of isoflavones, there is no
relation evident between initial cholesterol and cholesterol-
lowering (Table 3, Sacks et al1).

Influence of Serum Cholesterol-Lowering Diet
In 11 of the studies listed in Tables 1 to 3 of Sacks et al,1 soy
protein or isoflavones were tested in combination with a
serum cholesterol-lowering diet.15–17,20,28,31,33,34,36,44,46 The
average reduction in LDL in these studies was 2%, similar to
the full group. Thus, the effect on LDL of soy protein or
isoflavones does not appear to be modulated by the saturated
fat and cholesterol content of the diet.

Effects on Lipoprotein(a)

Lipoprotein(a), an LDL-like lipoprotein that is an indepen-
dent predictor of CVD was increased by soy protein in 2
studies21,50 and unchanged in 9 others.15,17,18,22,26,30 –32,36
Meinertz et al25 found that alcohol-extracted soy protein,
lacking isoflavones, did not raise Lp(a) as found in their
earlier study of intact soy protein,50 suggesting an adverse
effect of isoflavones. However, isoflavones had no effect on
Lp(a) in 6 other studies,15,36,41,46,47,49 nor did soy protein that
contained isoflavones.15,17,18,22,26,30 –32,36

Effects on Blood Pressure

Several studies tested the effect of soy protein with isofla-
vones compared with casein or milk protein on blood pres-

sure.18,21,26,28,33,36 Blood pressure decreased significantly in 1
study,21 but not
in the other 5.18,26,28,33,36 The weighted
average change is ⫺1 mm Hg systolic blood pressure. Sev-
eral studies that evaluated the effect of soy isoflavones also
did not find a significant effect on blood pressure.36,44,46,48,51

Conclusions

lipoprotein(a), or blood pressure. Thus,

Earlier research indicating that soy protein compared with
other proteins has clinically important favorable effects on
LDL cholesterol and other cardiovascular disease risk factors
has not enjoyed confirmation from many studies reported
during the past 10 years. A very large amount of soy protein,
comprising more than half of daily protein intake, may lower
LDL cholesterol by just a few percent when it replaces dairy
protein or a mixture of animal proteins. The evidence favors
soy protein rather than soy isoflavones as the responsible
nutrient. However, at this time the possibility cannot be ruled
out that another component in soybeans could be the active
factor. No benefit is evident on HDL cholesterol, triglycer-
ides,
the direct
cardiovascular health benefit of soy protein or of isoflavone
supplements is minimal at best. Soy protein or isoflavones
have not been shown to improve vasomotor symptoms of
menopause, and results are mixed regarding slowing of
postmenopausal bone loss. The efficacy and safety of soy
isoflavones for preventing or treating cancer of the breast,
endometrium, and prostate are not established; evidence from
clinical trials is meager and cautionary as regards a possible
adverse effect. For this reason, use of isoflavone supplements
in food or pills is not recommended. In contrast, soy products
such as tofu, “soy butter,” “soy nuts,” or some soy burgers
should be beneficial to cardiovascular and overall health
because of their high content of polyunsaturated fats, fiber,
vitamins, and minerals and low content of saturated fat.52
Using these and other soy foods to replace foods high in
animal protein that contain saturated fat and cholesterol may
confer benefits to cardiovascular health.53 Soy protein may
also be used to increase total dietary protein intake and reduce
carbohydrate or fat intake. However, much less is known
about the potential impact on risk factors for CVD of high
protein diets. In the meantime, these remain dynamic areas
for research. The AHA will continue to monitor the results
and modify its advisory statement as needed.
