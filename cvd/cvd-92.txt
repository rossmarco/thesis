A
BSTRACT
Background
It has been suggested that mercury,
a highly reactive heavy metal with no known physio-
logic activity, increases the risk of cardiovascular dis-
ease. Because fish intake is a major source of expo-
sure  to  mercury,  the  mercury  content  of  fish  may
counteract the beneficial effects of its n¡3 fatty acids.
Methods
In a case–control study conducted in eight
European countries and Israel, we evaluated the joint
association of mercury levels in toenail clippings and
docosahexaenoic acid (C22:6n¡3, or DHA) levels in
adipose tissue with the risk of a first myocardial infarc-
tion among men. The patients were 684 men with a
first diagnosis of myocardial infarction. The controls
were 724 men selected to be representative of the
same populations.
Results
The average toenail mercury level in con-
trols was 0.25 µg per gram. After adjustment for the
DHA level and coronary risk factors, the mercury lev-
els in the patients were 15 percent higher than those
in controls (95 percent confidence interval, 5 to 25 per-
cent). The risk-factor–adjusted odds ratio for myocar-
dial  infarction  associated  with  the  highest  as  com-
pared with the lowest quintile of mercury was 2.16
(95  percent  confidence  interval, 1.09  to  4.29;  P for
trend=0.006). After adjustment for the mercury level,
the DHA level was inversely associated with the risk
of myocardial infarction (odds ratio for the highest vs.
the lowest quintile, 0.59; 95 percent confidence inter-
val, 0.30 to 1.19; P for trend=0.02).
Conclusions
The toenail mercury level was directly
associated with the risk of myocardial infarction, and
the adipose-tissue DHA level was inversely associat-
ed with the risk. High mercury content may diminish
the  cardioprotective  effect  of  fish  intake.  (N  Engl  J
Med 2002;347:1747-54.)

In 1995, Salonen et al. reported an increased risk of

coronary heart disease among residents of the Kuo-
pio area in Finland whose hair samples had increased
levels of mercury.
The participants in that study,
however, had relatively high levels of mercury, which
were derived largely from locally contaminated fresh-
water fish.

Fish intake is a major source of exposure to mercu-
ry, mainly in the form of methylmercury.
 Intake of
fish or fish oils (long-chain n¡3 polyunsaturated fat-
ty acids) has long been hypothesized to prevent car-
diovascular  events.
  Two  large,  randomized  clinical
8
trials have shown reduced mortality after myocardial
infarction among patients assigned to a diet rich in
fatty fish

alizability of these findings to subjects without cor-
onary heart disease is uncertain. The results of epide-
miologic studies relating fish intake or fish-oil levels
to coronary events have been contradictory,
 and it
11
has been suggested that mercury may counteract the
beneficial cardiovascular effects of n¡3 fatty acids in
fish.

To evaluate the association of mercury with the risk
of myocardial infarction, and to test the hypothesis
that high mercury levels may offset the inverse associ-
ation between fish oil consumption and myocardial in-
farction, we assessed the joint association of mercury
levels in toenail clippings and docosahexaenoic acid
(C22:6n¡3, or DHA) levels in adipose tissue with the
risk of a first myocardial infarction among men who
were participants in the European Multicenter Case–

The  New  England  Journal  of  Medicine

Control Study on Antioxidants, Myocardial Infarction
and Cancer of the Breast (EURAMIC).

METHODS

Design and Subjects

14

12,13

The target population consisted of men 70 years of age or young-
er who were native residents of any of eight European countries
or Israel.
 Subjects were excluded if they had a previous diagno-
sis of myocardial infarction, drug or alcohol abuse, or a major psy-
chiatric disorder; if they were institutionalized; or if they had mod-
ified their dietary pattern in the previous year.

The patients were men with a first acute myocardial infarction
(code 410 of the 
International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revi-
), confirmed by characteristic electrocardiographic changes and
sion
elevated enzyme levels,
 who had been hospitalized within 24 hours
after the onset of symptoms. They were recruited from the coronary
care units of participating hospitals.

The controls were men without a history of myocardial infarc-
tion, recruited from the population of the catchment areas from
which the patients originated, and frequency-matched for age in
five-year intervals. In Finland, Israel, Germany, Scotland, and Swit-
zerland, random sampling from local population registers was used
to select controls. In Russia and in the two Spanish centers, popu-
lation registries could not be used, because of the lack of complete
census data or because of legal restrictions. Therefore, controls were
selected from among hospitalized patients with disorders not known
to be associated with dietary factors (renal colic, hernia, acute ap-
pendicitis or mesenteric adenitis, volvulus or subocclusion due to
fibrosis, noninfectious prostatism, and rectal or anal disorders other
than cancer, hemorrhoids, or chronic infections).
 When low par-
ticipation rates from population samples were anticipated, controls
were selected by random sampling from the catchment area of the
patient’s general practitioner (in the Netherlands) or by inviting ap-
parently healthy friends and relatives of the patient to participate
(in Norway).

Patients and controls were recruited concurrently during 1991
and 1992. The participation rates among potential subjects were 81
percent for patients and 64 percent for controls. Local institutional
review boards approved the study, and written informed consent
was obtained from study participants.

12,13

Data Collection

12,13 

Information on smoking, hypertension, and diabetes was collect-
ed by standard questionnaires.
A history of hypertension or di-
abetes was based on the patient’s report of a physician’s diagnosis.
A family history of coronary heart disease was defined by a self-
reported fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction in a parent. Clippings
from all 10 toenails were collected within eight weeks of enroll-
ment.
 The mean (±SD) weight of the samples was 53.8±39.0 mg.
13
A subcutaneous specimen of adipose tissue was taken from the but-
tock by needle aspiration.
 The adipose-tissue sample was taken
from patients within seven days after admission to the hospital. A
nonfasting sample of venous blood was also obtained. Blood sam-
ples were drawn from patients within 24 hours after hospital ad-
mission.

Analysis of Biologic Samples

Toenail mercury was measured by instrumental neutron-activa-
tion analysis at the Interfaculty Reactor Institute of Delft University
  Toenail  clippings  were

irradiated for four hours in a thermal flux of 5¬10
 neutrons per
second per square centimeter. After a decay time of 21 days, the
gamma radiation of mercury was measured in a well-type Ge(Li)
detector for one hour. Irradiation of study samples was conducted
from April 1998 through June 1999. Samples from patients and

12

15

controls were analyzed together, randomly distributed across batch-
es, and masked with respect to case–control status.

For each sample, the limit of detection was defined as the level
at which mercury could be detected with 97.5 percent certainty.
For a sample of average weight (53 mg), the limit of detection was
0.11 µg per gram. In the 76 samples with mercury levels below the
detection limit, we imputed a mercury level of one half the detec-
tion limit. For quality control, a sample of freeze-dried plankton ref-
erence material (BCR CRM-414, Community Bureau of Refer-
ence, Commission of European Communities) was included in each
analytic batch. The average of 48 measurements of this material was
0.26 µg per gram (95 percent confidence interval, 0.24 to 0.28),
against a certified mercury level of 0.276±0.018 µg per gram. The
interassay  coefficient  of  variation  for  this  reference  material  was
13.6 percent.

Fatty acids in adipose tissue were assayed at the National Public
Health Institute, Helsinki, Finland, by gas chromatography (model
HRCG412, HNU Nordion Oy).
 The portion of the fatty-acid
peak area containing DHA, as determined by gas chromatography,
was calculated and expressed as a fraction of the total fatty-acid peak
area. Because the levels of eicosapentaenoic acid (C20:5n¡3) in ad-
ipose tissue were below the detection limit of the chromatograph
for most samples, fish-oil fatty acids were represented exclusively
by DHA.
 The interassay coefficient of variation for DHA in adi-
18
pose tissue was 25 percent. The serum total cholesterol levels were
determined by standard methods.

16,17

12

Statistical Analysis

Because the distribution of mercury was right-skewed, logarith-
mic transformation was used to improve normality. The distribution
of mercury in controls was used to compute cutoff points and me-
dians for quintiles of exposure. For multivariate analysis, the asso-
ciation of mercury with the risk of myocardial infarction was esti-
mated by multiple logistic regression. The odds ratios in quintiles
2, 3, 4, and 5 were estimated by using the lowest quintile as the ref-
erence category, and tests for trend across quintiles of mercury were
performed. The reported P values are two-tailed. Statistical analyses
were performed with S-Plus software.

RESULTS

12

In comparison with the controls, the patients had
significantly higher body-mass index and lower high-
density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and were more
likely to have hypertension, to have diabetes, to smoke,
and to have a family history of myocardial infarction
  The  total  cholesterol  level  was  lower

among patients than among controls, almost certainly
reflecting the effect of acute myocardial infarction.
Therefore, total cholesterol was not further consid-
ered in case–control comparisons.

Controls from Zeist, the Netherlands, and Berlin,
Germany, had the lowest average levels of mercury
among controls (0.14 and 0.17 µg per gram, respec-
tively), whereas those from the two Spanish centers
had the highest (0.57 µg per gram in Granada and
0.51 µg per gram in Málaga) — a 4.1-fold range of
variation (Table 2). The level of DHA in adipose tis-
sue was strongly correlated with the toenail mercury
level (Table 3). The age- and center-adjusted corre-
lation  coefficient  between  the  levels  of  DHA  and
mercury was 0.34 (P<0.001).

After adjustment for age, center, and DHA level,

the patients had higher mercury levels than the con-
trols (case–control ratio, 1.10; 95 percent confidence
interval, 1.03 to 1.18) (Table 2). This association per-
sisted after the exclusion of the two Spanish centers,
which were the centers with the highest mercury levels
(DHA-adjusted case–control ratio, 1.09; 95 percent
confidence interval, 1.02 to 1.17), and after adjust-
ment for multiple cardiovascular risk factors (case–
control ratio, 1.15; 95 percent confidence interval,
1.05 to 1.25).

Analysis with adjustment for age and center showed
an increased risk of myocardial infarction at high mer-
cury levels (P for trend=0.01) (Table 4). Adjustment
for DHA markedly increased the association and elic-
ited a graded, positive dose–response pattern. This
trend was further strengthened after adjustment for
traditional risk factors and levels of antioxidants, re-
sulting  in  an  odds  ratio  of  2.16  for  patients  in  the
highest quintile of mercury level, as compared with
the lowest (95 percent confidence interval, 1.09 to
4.29; P for trend=0.006). When mercury was intro-
duced as a continuous variable in the regression mod-

from the 25th to the 75th percentile of the mercury
distribution was 1.63 (95 percent confidence interval,
1.22 to 2.18; P=0.001).

The dose–response curve for the relation between
the mercury level and the risk of myocardial infarction
was further examined by nonparametric logistic re-
gression (Fig. 1).19 There was a positive, monotonic in-
crease in risk associated with mercury levels above 0.25
µg per gram, which was steeper after adjustment for
DHA levels.

The average levels of DHA, expressed as a percent-
age of the total fatty-acid peak area, were 0.24±0.13

percent in patients and 0.25±0.13 percent in controls.
In analyses adjusted for age and center, there was no
consistent  relation  between  increasing  DHA  levels
and the risk of myocardial infarction (Table 4).17 Af-
ter adjustment for the mercury level as well, there was
a significant trend toward a lower risk of myocardial
infarction  with  higher  DHA  levels  (P  for  trend=
0.01). This trend was confirmed in the nonparamet-
ric analyses (Fig. 1). There was no interaction between
mercury and DHA with respect to their associations
with the risk of myocardial infarction (P for the in-
teraction=0.61).

We performed several sensitivity analyses to assess
the consistency of our findings. First, we reanalyzed
the data while excluding the results from Málaga, the
center with the strongest effect of mercury. When we
did so, the association of mercury with the risk of my-
ocardial infarction persisted: the DHA-adjusted case–
control ratio of mercury levels was 1.08 (95 percent
confidence interval, 1.01 to 1.15). In addition, there
were no significant differences in the association of
mercury and myocardial infarction among study cen-
ters (P for the interaction between center and mercu-
ry level=0.20). Second, we found similar results in
centers that used controls from the general popula-
tion and in those that selected other types of controls
(data not shown). Third, we confirmed that the par-
ticipation rates in each center, both for patients and
for controls, were not correlated with the association
between mercury level and myocardial infarction (P=
0.66 for the correlation in controls and P=0.97 for
the correlation in patients). Finally, we assessed the
association between mercury level and myocardial in-
farction, restricting our analyses to the five centers with
the highest response rates among controls; the results
were similar to our overall results (the ratio of the mer-
cury level in patients relative to that in controls, after
adjustment for DHA levels, was 1.12; P=0.005).

DISCUSSION

In this international case–control study, we found
an independent and graded association between toe-
nail mercury levels and the risk of myocardial infarc-
tion. Furthermore, mercury masked an inverse associ-
ation between DHA levels and the risk of myocardial
infarction that became evident only after adjustment
for the mercury level.

Several factors add to the strength of our findings.
First, toenail and adipose-tissue samples were collect-
ed from patients shortly after they had had a myocar-
dial infarction. These measurements are therefore un-
likely to have been affected by the development of
disease, a common limitation of case–control studies.
Second, only patients with a first myocardial infarction
were examined, so it is unlikely that they had changed
their diet before the event. Finally, toenail mercury is
a reliable biologic marker of long-term exposure to
mercury.2,20,21 The validity of the mercury measure-
ments in our study is further reinforced by the finding
of a strong association between mercury and DHA, a
biologic marker of fatty-fish intake.18

Mercury exists in three forms: elemental mercury,
inorganic mercury compounds, and organic mercury,
primarily  methylmercury.1,2  Exposure  to  inorganic
mercury  occurs  occupationally;  people  can  also  be
exposed to inorganic mercury from silver–mercury
amalgam in dental fillings. Exposure to methylmercu-
ry results almost exclusively from the consumption of

fish, shellfish, and marine animals; these foods are a
major source of exposure to mercury for the general
population.2 Large, predatory fish, such as swordfish
and sharks, have the highest concentrations of mercury
(around 1 µg per gram); tuna, trout, pike, and bass
have intermediate concentrations (0.1 to 0.5 µg per
gram); and most shellfish have low concentrations.1,2
In populations eating large quantities of fish from lo-
cally contaminated lakes or rivers, however, other spe-
cies may be the main contributors to the total intake
of mercury.6

Mercury  may  promote  atherosclerosis  and  hence
increase  the  risk  of  myocardial  infarction  in  several
ways. Mercury promotes the production of free rad-
icals in experimental models,3-5 and it may bind sele-
nium to form mercury selenide, an insoluble complex
that cannot serve as a cofactor for glutathione perox-
idase.22 In addition, methylmercury has a very high
affinity for thiol groups, and it may inactivate the an-
tioxidant properties of glutathione, catalase, and su-
peroxide dismutase.23 Mercury may induce lipid per-
oxidation,24 and mercury levels were a strong predictor
of oxidized low-density lipoprotein levels in the Kuo-
pio  Ischemic  Heart  Disease  Study.6  Mercury  com-
pounds may also promote platelet aggregability25 and
blood coagulability,26 inhibit endothelial-cell forma-
tion and migration,27 and affect apoptosis and the in-
flammatory response.28 Increased rates of cardiovas-
cular  disease  were  found  among  mercury-exposed
workers,29,30 and mercury levels in hair predicted the
progression of carotid atherosclerosis in a longitudi-
nal study.31 Toenail mercury, however, did not predict
the incidence of coronary heart disease in a nested
case–control study in U.S. health professionals report-
ed elsewhere in this issue of the Journal.32

Some limitations also need to be considered in the
interpretation of our findings. Our analyses were based
on single measurements of mercury and DHA, and
they are subject to random measurement error. In ad-
dition, the levels of mercury or DHA were low in
many study participants, thus increasing the likelihood
of analytical error. It is likely that the results of our
analyses underestimate the associations of both mer-
cury and DHA levels with myocardial infarction.

Another  potential  limitation  of  our  study  is  that
the participation rate was higher for patients than for
controls. Although this raises the possibility of selec-
tion bias, the association of mercury levels with my-
ocardial infarction was higher in centers with higher
participation rates, making selection bias an unlikely
explanation of our results. Furthermore, because both
mercury and DHA are derived primarily from fish in
the diet, selection bias would be expected to influence
associations of the levels of both of these substances
with myocardial infarction in the same direction, not
in opposite directions.

We did not have information on the sources of mer-
cury or DHA or on the amount and type of fish con-
sumed by the study participants. However, the high
mercury levels in the two Spanish centers are consistent
with the high consumption of fish in that country33
and the high levels of mercury in fish caught in the
Mediterranean34,35 and consumed in those cities. The
correlation between mercury and DHA suggests that
fish is probably the main source of mercury in toenails
in our populations, although other sources of expo-
sure are possible. Finally, our patient population was
restricted to patients with myocardial infarction who
survived until hospitalization. The observed associa-
tions thus cannot be generalized to patients with acute
cardiac events who die before hospitalization.

Fish intake is currently recommended to reduce the
risk of cardiovascular diseases36 and as part of a Med-
iterranean-type diet.37 However, the findings of epi-
demiologic studies of fish intake or fish-oil levels and
coronary heart disease are contradictory, ranging from
clearly inverse associations38-40 to virtually null associa-
tions17,41-45 and to positive associations.6 Protective ef-
fects of fatty fish9 and fish-oil supplements10 have been
found  in  two  secondary-prevention  trials.  In  both
trials, the protection was largely limited to fatal cor-
onary events, whereas we found an inverse association
between DHA levels and nonfatal myocardial infarc-
tion. It is possible that, although the antiarrhythmic
effects of fish oils may prevail in the prevention of re-
current events in patients who have had a myocardial
infarction or in the prevention of sudden death from
cardiac causes,46,47 the antiaggregant and other anti-
atherogenic properties of fish oils may also have a sub-
stantial preventive effect.

The risk of cardiovascular disease in a population
may depend on the balance between n¡3 fatty acids
and methylmercury in the fish consumed. Exposure
to methylmercury is already a concern in specific high-
risk groups; the Food and Drug Administration has
advised pregnant women and women who may be-
come pregnant not to eat swordfish, king mackerel,
tilefish, shark, or fish from locally contaminated ar-
eas.48 Our results raise the possibility that this advice
should be extended to the general adult population.
However, our findings do not imply that people should
stop eating fish. Our mercury-adjusted analysis is con-
sistent with a protective effect of dietary fish, provided
it is not heavily contaminated.
