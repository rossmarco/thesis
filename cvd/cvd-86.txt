BACKGROUND
Observational cohort studies and a secondary prevention trial have shown inverse asso-
ciations between adherence to the Mediterranean diet and cardiovascular risk.
METHODS
In a multicenter trial in Spain, we assigned 7447 participants (55 to 80 years of age, 57% 
women) who were at high cardiovascular risk, but with no cardiovascular disease at enroll-
ment, to one of three diets: a Mediterranean diet supplemented with extra-virgin olive oil, 
a Mediterranean diet supplemented with mixed nuts, or a control diet (advice to reduce 
dietary fat). Participants received quarterly educational sessions and, depending on group 
assignment, free provision of extra-virgin olive oil, mixed nuts, or small nonfood gifts. 
The primary end point was a major cardiovascular event (myocardial infarction, stroke, or 
death from cardiovascular causes). After a median follow-up of 4.8 years, the trial was 
stopped on the basis of a prespecified interim analysis. In 2013, we reported the results 
for the primary end point in the Journal. We subsequently identified protocol deviations, 
including enrollment of household members without randomization, assignment to a 
study group without randomization of some participants at 1 of 11 study sites, and appar-
ent inconsistent use of randomization tables at another site. We have withdrawn our 
previously published report and now report revised effect estimates based on analyses that 
do not rely exclusively on the assumption that all the participants were randomly assigned.
RESULTS
A primary end-point event occurred in 288 participants; there were 96 events in the group 
assigned to a Mediterranean diet with extra-virgin olive oil (3.8%), 83 in the group as-
signed to a Mediterranean diet with nuts (3.4%), and 109 in the control group (4.4%). 
In the intention-to-treat analysis including all the participants and adjusting for baseline 
characteristics and propensity scores, the hazard ratio was 0.69 (95% confidence interval 
[CI], 0.53 to 0.91) for a Mediterranean diet with extra-virgin olive oil and 0.72 (95% CI, 
0.54 to 0.95) for a Mediterranean diet with nuts, as compared with the control diet. Results 
were similar after the omission of 1588 participants whose study-group assignments were 
known or suspected to have departed from the protocol.
CONCLUSIONS
In this study involving persons at high cardiovascular risk, the incidence of major cardio-
vascular events was lower among those assigned to a Mediterranean diet supplemented 
with  extra-virgin  olive  oil  or  nuts  than  among  those  assigned  to  a  reduced-fat  diet.

The traditional Mediterranean diet 

is characterized by a high intake of olive 
oil, fruit, nuts, vegetables, and cereals; a 
moderate intake of fish and poultry; a low intake 
of dairy products, red meat, processed meats, 
and sweets; and wine in moderation, consumed 
with  meals.1  In  observational  cohort  studies2,3 
and a secondary prevention trial (the Lyon Diet 
Heart Study),4 increasing adherence to the Medi-
terranean diet has been consistently associated 
with lower cardiovascular risk.2-4 A systematic 
review  ranked  the  Mediterranean  diet  as  the 
most likely dietary model to provide protection 
against coronary heart disease.5 Small clinical 
trials have uncovered plausible biologic mecha-
nisms  to  explain  the  salutary  effects  of  this 
food pattern.6-9 We designed a randomized trial, 
PREDIMED (Prevención con Dieta Mediterránea), 
to test the efficacy of two Mediterranean diets 
(one supplemented with extra-virgin olive oil and 
another with nuts), as compared with a control 
diet (advice on a low-fat diet), on primary cardio-
vascular prevention. Our original report was pub-
lished in the Journal in 2013.10 A 2017 analysis11 
of the distributions of baseline variables in ran-
domized trials identified the PREDIMED trial as 
having distributions that were significantly dif-
ferent from what would have been expected to 
result from randomization. This report led to our 
conducting  a  review  of  how  participants  were 
assigned  to  various  intervention  groups;  that 
review revealed irregularities in our randomiza-
tion procedures. Therefore, we have withdrawn 
our original report12 and now publish a new report.
We describe the protocol deviations and re-
port revised intention-to-treat and per-protocol 
effect estimates that do not rely exclusively on 
the  assumption  that  all  the  participants  had 
been  randomly  assigned  to  the  intervention 
groups.  A  detailed  description  of  the  changes 
that have been introduced and departures from 
the protocol is provided in the Supplementary 
Appendix, available with the full text of this ar-
ticle at NEJM.org.

Methods

Study Design
The PREDIMED study was designed as a parallel-
group, multicenter, randomized trial. Details of 
the  study  design  have  been  reported  previous-
ly.13,14 The protocol, available at NEJM.org, was 
approved by the institutional review boards at all 

study locations. The authors vouch for the accu-
racy and completeness of the data and all analy-
ses  and  attest  that  this  report  accurately  de-
scribes the conduct of the study as we know it.
Funding was provided by grants from Insti-
tuto  de  Salud  Carlos  III,  Spanish  Ministry  of 
Health. Supplemental foods were donated, in-
cluding extra-virgin olive oil (by Hojiblanca and 
Patrimonio Comunal Olivarero, both in Spain), 
walnuts (by the California Walnut Commission), 
almonds (by Borges, in Spain), and hazelnuts (by 
Morella Nuts, in Spain). None of the sponsors 
had any role in the study design, data analysis, 
or reporting of the results.

Participant Selection and Randomization
Eligible participants were men (55 to 80 years of 
age) or women (60 to 80 years of age) with no 
cardiovascular disease at enrollment, who had 
either type 2 diabetes mellitus or at least three 
of  the  following  major  risk  factors:  smoking, 
hypertension,  elevated  low-density  lipoprotein 
cholesterol levels, low high-density lipoprotein 
cholesterol  levels,  overweight  or  obesity,  or  a 
family history of premature coronary heart dis-
ease. Detailed enrollment criteria are provided on 
pages 18 and 19 in the Supplementary Appendix. 
All  the  participants  provided  written  informed 
consent.

The protocol specified that participants were 
to be randomly assigned, in a 1:1:1 ratio, to one 
of three dietary intervention groups: a Mediter-
ranean diet supplemented with extra-virgin olive 
oil, a Mediterranean diet supplemented with nuts, 
or a control diet. Enrollment began on June 25, 
2003, and the last participant was recruited on 
June 30, 2009. The analyses in this report were 
based on a database locked as of September 2011 
and included primary end-point events occurring 
through December 1, 2010. Randomization was 
concealed with the use of closed envelopes8 dur-
ing part of the pilot phase of the study, but en-
velopes were not used for the remainder of the 
study.  A  computer-generated  random-number 
sequence provided randomization tables for the 
11  participating  sites,  which  encompassed  169 
clinics.  These  tables  included  four  strata  (men 
<70 years of age, men ≥70 years of age, women 
<70 years of age, and women ≥70 years of age) 
and  were  initially  generated  for  1000  partici-
pants (250 per stratum) for each site. We did not 
use blocks for randomization. Further details on 
the use of these tables at each of the 11 sites can

be found on pages 8 and 9 and 78 through 82 in 
the Supplementary Appendix. All the sites were 
given the same randomization sequence.

There were departures from the randomiza-
tion procedures that had been specified in the 
protocol that were not described in our original 
report. We included 425 participants who shared 
a  household  with  a  previously  enrolled  partici-
pant. These 425 participants were not randomly 
assigned but were assigned to the same interven-
tion as the member of the household who was 
already enrolled (Tables S2 and S3 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix). This was done to allow the 
recruitment of eligible household members and 
to avoid members of the same household being 
assigned to different diets. After the study had 
begun,  the  steering  committee  approved  this 
protocol change. The protocol was not amended, 
and this protocol change was not described in 
the original report published in the Journal. In 
July 2017, we learned that at 1 of the 11 study 
sites (Site D), 467 participants were not randomly 
assigned as individual participants but instead 
were assigned according to clinic — that is, all 
the participants in each clinic received the same 
intervention (2 clinics assigned a Mediterranean 
diet  with  extra-virgin  olive  oil,  5  assigned  a 
Mediterranean  diet  with  nuts,  and  4  assigned 
a control diet) (see pages 9 and 10 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix for additional details). In addi-
tion, review of the documentation about random-
ization procedures and of the actual assignments 
to the three groups suggested that the random-
ization tables were inconsistently used in another 
study site (Site B, 593 participants) (see pages 10 
and 11 in the Supplementary Appendix for details).

Interventions and Measurements
The dietary intervention8,13-15 is detailed on pages 
20 through 24 in the Supplementary Appendix. 
The specific recommended diets are summarized 
in Table 1. Participants in the group assigned to 
a Mediterranean diet with extra-virgin olive oil 
received 1 liter of the oil per week per house-
hold, with the recommendation to consume at 
least 4 tablespoons per day of extra-virgin olive 
oil per person. Participants in the group assigned 
to a Mediterranean diet with nuts received 30 g 
of mixed nuts per day per person (15 g of wal-
nuts, 7.5 g of hazelnuts, and 7.5 g of almonds) at 
no cost, and those in the control group received 
small nonfood gifts. No total calorie restriction 
was advised, nor was physical activity promoted.

*  The amount of olive oil includes oil used for cooking and salads and oil con-
sumed in meals eaten outside the home. In the group assigned to the Mediter-
ranean diet with extra-virgin olive oil, the goal was to consume 50 g (approxi-
mately 4 tbsp) or more per day of the polyphenol-rich olive oil supplied, instead 
of the ordinary refined variety, which is poor in polyphenols. The participants 
received a free supply (15 liters every 3 months) to include the oil used for 
cooking and family needs.

†  For participants assigned to the Mediterranean diet with nuts, the recommend-

ed consumption was one daily serving (30 g, composed of 15 g of walnuts, 
7.5 g of almonds, and 7.5 g of hazelnuts). Participants received for free the 
needed allotments of tree nuts in packages of 2 kg of walnuts, 1 kg of almonds, 
and 1 kg of hazelnuts every 3 months, with the extra amounts to be shared 
with family members.

‡  Sofrito is a sauce made with tomato and onion, often including garlic and aro-

matic herbs, and slowly simmered with olive oil.

§  Commercial bakery goods, sweets, and pastries (not homemade) included cakes, 

cookies, biscuits, and custard.

¶  Up to September 2006, a brief personal recommendation and a leaflet with 
written guidelines to attain these goals (see page 53 in the Supplementary 
Appendix) were given to participants on a yearly basis. Starting in October 2006, 
the intensity of these recommendations was increased, including also group 
sessions and personal advice repeated every 3 months (i.e., with the same 
 intensity and frequency of contacts as in the two Mediterranean-diet groups). 
The composition of the recommended diet, however, was not changed.

‖  Participants were advised to remove the visible fat (or the skin) of chicken, 
duck, pork, lamb, or veal before cooking and the fat of soups, broths, and 
cooked meat dishes before consumption.

For  participants  in  the  two  Mediterranean-
diet groups, dietitians held individual and group 
dietary-training sessions at the baseline visit and 
quarterly thereafter. In each session, participants 
completed  a  14-item  dietary  questionnaire  to 
assess  adherence  to  the  Mediterranean  diet8,16 
(Table  S4  in  the  Supplementary  Appendix)  so 
that  personalized  advice  could  be  provided  to 
the study participants in these groups. Question-
naire scores ranged from 0 to 14, with scores 
lower than 10 defined as low adherence to the 
Mediterranean diet.

Participants in the control group also received 
dietary training at the baseline visit and com-
pleted the 14-item questionnaire at baseline to 
assess their adherence to the Mediterranean diet. 
During the first 3 years of the study, they re-
ceived a leaflet explaining the low-fat diet (see 
page 53 in the Supplementary Appendix) on a 
yearly basis. However, the realization that the 
more infrequent visit schedule and less intense 
support for the control group might be limita-
tions  of  the  study  prompted  us  to  amend  the 
protocol in October 2006. Thereafter, participants 
who were assigned to the control diet received 
personalized advice and were invited to group 
sessions with the same frequency and intensity 
as those in the Mediterranean-diet groups, with 
the use of a separate 9-item dietary questionnaire 
(Table S5 in the Supplementary Appendix). Scores 
ranged from 0 to 9, with higher scores indicat-
ing greater adherence to a low-fat diet. Except for 
the Site D clinics discussed above and 11 clinics 
at Site I, all clinics of sufficient size delivered all 
three  of  the  interventions  (see  page  11  in  the 
Supplementary Appendix).

A general medical questionnaire, a 137-item 
validated food-frequency questionnaire,17 and the 
Minnesota Leisure-Time Physical Activity Ques-
tionnaire were administered on a yearly basis.13 
Information from the food-frequency questionnaire 
was used to estimate intake of energy and nutri-
ents. Weight, height, and waist circumference were 
directly measured annually.18 Biomarkers of ad-
herence, including urinary hydroxytyrosol  levels 
(to confirm adherence in the group receiving extra-
virgin olive oil) and plasma alpha-linolenic acid 
levels (to confirm adherence in the group receiv-
ing mixed nuts), were measured in random sub-
samples of participants at 1, 3, and 5 years (Figs. 
S9 and S10 in the Supplementary Appendix).

End Points
The primary end point was a composite of myo-
cardial infarction, stroke, and death from car-
diovascular  causes.  Secondary  end  points  were 
stroke, myocardial infarction, death from car-
diovascular causes, and death from any cause. 
We used four sources of information to identify 
end points: repeated contacts with participants, 
contacts with family physicians, a yearly review 
of medical records, and consultation of the Na-
tional  Death  Index.  All  medical  records  that 
were related to end points were examined by the 
end-point adjudication committee, whose mem-
bers  were  unaware  of  the  intervention-group 
assignments.  Only  end  points  that  were  con-
firmed by the adjudication committee and that 
occurred between June 25, 2003, and December 1, 
2010, were included in the analyses. The criteria 
for  adjudicating  primary  and  secondary  end 
points are detailed on pages 26 and 27 in the 
Supplementary Appendix.

Statistical Analysis
We  initially  estimated  that  a  sample  of  9000 
participants would be required to provide a sta-
tistical power of 80% to detect a 20% lower risk 
of the primary end point in each Mediterranean-
diet group than in the control-diet group during 
a 4-year follow-up period, assuming an absolute 
cumulative risk of 12% in the control group.13,19 
In  April  2008,  on  the  advice  of  the  data  and 
safety  monitoring  board  and  on  the  basis  of 
lower-than-expected  rates  of  end-point  events, 
the sample size was recalculated as 7400 partici-
pants, with the assumption of a 6-year follow-up 
period because of slower-than-expected recruit-
ment and an underlying absolute cumulative risk 
of the primary end point of 8.8% in the control 
group and 6.6% in the Mediterranean-diet groups. 
The  relationships  between  enrollment  size  and 
statistical  power,  under  several  assumptions, 
are shown in Figure S6 in the Supplementary 
Appendix.

Yearly interim analyses began on March 2008 
after a median of 2 years of follow-up. With the 
use of O’Brien–Fleming stopping boundaries, the 
P  values  for  stopping  the  study  at  each  yearly 
interim analysis were 5×10−6, 0.001, 0.009, and 
0.02 for benefit and 9×10−5, 0.005, 0.02, and 0.05 
for adverse effects.20 The stopping boundary for 
the benefit of the Mediterranean diets with re-

spect  to  the  primary  end  point  was  crossed  at 
the fourth interim evaluation; on July 22, 2011, 
the  data  and  safety  monitoring  board  recom-
mended stopping the study on the basis of end 
points documented through December 1, 2010. 
After the study was stopped, we advised all the 
participants, including those in the control group, 
to follow the Mediterranean diet.

The interim and original primary analyses es-
timated differences between the groups assigned 
to different interventions (intention-to-treat analy-
ses). The information on protocol deviations was 
not  considered  in  these  analyses.  Participants 
were followed from the baseline visit until the 
occurrence of a primary end-point event, death, 
or the last contact date from either medical rec-
ords or study visits. We did not record the date of 
randomization and thus do not report the time 
between  randomization  and  the  baseline  visit; 
for all the participants, we used the date of the 
baseline visit as time 0 in our analyses. No par-
ticipant  had  a  primary  or  secondary  end-point 
event  between  randomization  and  baseline  ac-
cording to our review of the medical records.

We constructed Kaplan–Meier cumulative-inci-
dence curves according to intervention group and 
calculated hazard ratios on an intention-to-treat 
basis,  with  the  control  group  as  the  reference, 
using a Cox model with indicators for the Medi-
terranean diet with extra-virgin olive oil and the 
Mediterranean diet with nuts. We used robust 
variance estimators to account for intracluster 
correlations  in  all  Cox  models,  considering  as 
clusters the members of the same household and 
the participants in the same clinic of Site D. We 
compared baseline characteristics across the three 
groups and conducted analyses that did not rely 
on the assumption that all the participants were 
randomly assigned and that randomization would 
distribute baseline characteristics of the partici-
pants  equally  across  intervention  groups.  Our 
main analysis was a multivariable model strati-
fied according to site, sex, and educational level 
(five categories); to account for potential imbal-
ances in baseline risk factors among the inter-
vention  groups,  the  model  included  nine  other 
baseline variables as covariates (see page 12 in 
the Supplementary Appendix). This model was 
also adjusted for propensity scores that used 30 
baseline variables to estimate the probability of 
assignment  to  each  of  the  intervention  groups 

(detailed on pages 12 through 17 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix).

Prespecified subgroup analyses were conduct-
ed according to sex, age, body-mass index (BMI), 
status  with  respect  to  cardiovascular  risk  fac-
tors, and baseline adherence to the Mediterra-
nean diet. In sensitivity analyses, we excluded 
the 1588 participants whose randomization pro-
cedures were known or suspected to have devi-
ated from the protocol: all 652 participants from 
Site D (35 were second members of a household), 
593  participants  from  Site  B  (47  were  second 
members of a household), and another 343 sec-
ond  household  members  from  other  sites.  In 
addition,  we  performed  sensitivity  analyses  to 
assess how strong and prevalent an unmeasured 
confounder would have to be to explain the ob-
served results (Table S25 in the Supplementary 
Appendix).  We  also  adjusted  for  missing  data 
and loss to follow-up, implemented other exclu-
sions, and used alternative analytic approaches 
(see pages 30 through 35 and Figs. S2 and S4 in 
the Supplementary Appendix).

A secondary analysis estimated the per-proto-
col effect21 of the Mediterranean diet as compared 
with the control diet that would have been ob-
served if all the participants had adhered to their 
assigned interventions throughout the follow-up 
period. For participants assigned to the Mediter-
ranean-diet groups, adherence was defined as a 
score of 10 or higher on the 14-item question-
naire.  For  those  assigned  to  the  low-fat  diet, 
adherence was defined as a fat intake of 30% or 
less of total energy intake according to the food-
frequency questionnaires that were administered 
annually to the three groups or a score or 6 or 
higher on the 9-item questionnaire. We censored 
data for participants when they first stopped ad-
hering  to  their  assigned  intervention,  estimated 
inverse-probability weights to adjust for postran-
domization  prognostic  factors,  and  estimated 
the hazard ratio for an end-point event in the 
Mediterranean-diet groups as compared with the 
low-fat diet group.22,23

The validity of the per-protocol effect estimate 
relies on several assumptions. It assumes that 
loss to follow-up, data collection, and adherence 
can  be  treated  as  sequentially  randomized  at 
each time point, given the measured prognostic 
factors  before  and  after  randomization.22  Both 
Mediterranean-diet  groups  were  combined  for

precision  because  only  39%  of  the  events  re-
mained uncensored after the application of our 
strict definition of adherence. We used the pre-
dicted  values  from  this  model  after  adding  a 
product term between intervention and time to 
estimate cumulative-incidence curves (see pages 
36  through  38  in  the  Supplementary  Appendix 
for details).

Baseline Characteristics
From  June  25,  2003,  through  June  30,  2009,  a 
total of 8713 candidates were screened for eligi-
bility, and 7447 were assigned to one of the three 
intervention groups (Fig. S7 in the Supplemen-
tary  Appendix).  Their  baseline  characteristics 
according  to  intervention  group  are  shown  in 
Table 2, and in Table S23 in the Supplementary 
Appendix.  The  exclusion  of  participants  whose 
randomization procedures were known to have 
deviated  from  the  protocol  did  not  materially 
change these results. Drug-treatment regimens 
at baseline were similar for participants in the 
three groups, and they continued to be balanced 
during  the  follow-up  period  (Table  S6  in  the 
Supplementary Appendix).

Participants  were  followed  for  a  median  of 
4.8 years (interquartile range, 2.8 to 5.8). After 
the baseline visit, 210 participants (2.8%) chose 
not to attend subsequent visits (1.2% of the par-
ticipants assigned to a Mediterranean diet with 
extra-virgin olive oil, 2.7% of those assigned to 
a  Mediterranean  diet  with  nuts,  and  4.7%  of 
those  in  the  control  group).  The  rate  of  study 
discontinuation (>2 years since last contact) was 
11.3%  in  the  control  group  and  4.9%  in  the 
Mediterranean-diet groups; subsequent follow-up 
was based on reviews of medical records (Fig. S7 
and Table S24 in the Supplementary Appendix). 
Participants who dropped out of the study were, 
on  average,  1.4  years  younger  than  those  who 
remained in the study and had a higher BMI (the 
weight  in  kilograms  divided  by  the  square  of 
height in meters) by 0.4, a higher waist-to-height 
ratio (by 0.01), and a lower score for adherence 
to the Mediterranean diet (by 1.0 points on the 
14-item questionnaire) at baseline.

Adherence to the Dietary Intervention
The  scores  on  the  14-item  Mediterranean-diet 
questionnaire increased over the follow-up period 

for  the  participants  in  the  two  Mediterranean-
diet groups (Table S7 and Fig. S8 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix). There were substantial dif-
ferences between the Mediterranean-diet groups 
and the control group in 12 of the 14 items (Table 
S7 in the Supplementary Appendix). Changes in 
biomarkers also indicated good adherence to the 
dietary assignments (Figs. S9 and S10 in the Sup-
plementary Appendix).

Participants  in  the  two  Mediterranean-diet 
groups increased weekly servings of fish (by 0.3 
servings) and legumes (by 0.4 servings) in com-
parison with those in the control group (Table 
S8 in the Supplementary Appendix). In addition, 
participants  assigned  to  a  Mediterranean  diet 
with extra-virgin olive oil and those assigned to 
a  Mediterranean  diet  with  nuts  increased  their 
consumption of extra-virgin olive oil (to 50 and 
32 g per day, respectively) and nuts (to 0.9 and 
6 servings per week, respectively). The main nu-
trient changes in the Mediterranean-diet groups 
reflected the fat content and composition of the 
supplemental foods (Tables S9 and S10 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). No relevant diet-related 
adverse effects were reported (see page 38 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). We found little differ-
ence in changes in physical activity among the 
three groups.

End Points
In the intention-to-treat analysis, there were 96 
primary end-point events in the group assigned 
to  a  Mediterranean  diet  with  extra-virgin  olive 
oil (3.8%), 83 in the group assigned to a Medi-
terranean diet with nuts (3.4%), and 109 in the 
control group (4.4%). The respective incidence 
rates were 8.1, 8.0, and 11.2 per 1000 person-
years, and the 5-year absolute risks were 3.6%, 
4.0%, and 5.7%, respectively (Table 3). The un-
adjusted hazard ratios that used robust variance 
estimators to account for intracluster correlations 
were 0.70 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.53 to 
0.92) for a Mediterranean diet with extra-virgin 
olive  oil  and  0.70  (95%  CI,  0.53  to  0.94)  for  a 
Mediterranean diet with nuts as compared with 
the control diet.

Results of our primary analyses that included 
adjustment for propensity scores and 12 baseline 
participant characteristics were similar to those 
of the unadjusted analyses, with hazard ratios of 
0.69 (95% CI, 0.53 to 0.91) for a Mediterranean 
diet with extra-virgin olive oil and 0.72 (95% CI,

†  The primary end point was a composite of myocardial infarction, stroke, and death from cardiovascular causes.
‡  In the combined Mediterranean-diet groups, the 5-year absolute risk of the primary end point was 3.8% (95% CI, 3.2  

to 4.4).

§  The intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis included all 7447 participants.
¶  The Cox model was stratified according to sex, recruiting site, and educational level (five categories) and adjusted for 

age (continuous variable), smoking status (never smoked, former smoker, or current smoker), hypertension at baseline 
(yes or no), dyslipidemia at baseline (yes or no), diabetes at baseline (yes or no), family history of premature coronary 
heart disease (yes or no), body-mass index (continuous variable), waist-to-height ratio (continuous variable), physical 
activity (in quintiles), and propensity scores that used 30 baseline variables to estimate the probability of assignment  
to each of the intervention groups (see pages 12 through 17 in the Supplementary Appendix). Robust standard errors to 
account for intracluster correlations were used.

‖  The analysis included 6405 participants. Excluded were second members of the same household (425 participants) and 

participants from Site D (617 participants). When participants from Site B were also excluded, the sample size was 
5859 and the adjusted hazard ratios were 0.71 (95% CI, 0.52 to 0.97) for the group assigned to a Mediterranean diet 
with extra-virgin olive oil, 0.68 (95% CI, 0.49 to 0.95) for the group assigned to a Mediterranean diet with nuts, and 
0.69 (95% CI, 0.53 to 0.92) for the combined Mediterranean-diet groups, with the group assigned to a control diet as 
the reference.

0.54 to 0.95) for a Mediterranean diet with nuts 
(Fig. 1A and Table 3). There were similar results 
on three alternative analyses: one that was ad-
justed with inverse-probability weighting (mod-
els 3A through 3C in Fig. S2 in the Supplemen-
tary  Appendix),  one  that  included  adjustments 
for  the  Framingham  risk  score24  (models  6A 
through 6C in Fig. S2 in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix),  and  one  that  omitted  participants 
known or suspected to have been assigned to an 
intervention  group  without  individual  random-
ization (Table 3 and Figs. 2 and 3, and Figs. S2 
and  S4  in  the  Supplementary  Appendix).  The 
results  for  secondary  end  points  are  shown  in 
Table 3 and Figure 1B.

To provide an alternative, noncausal explana-
tion of the observed association (i.e., to change 
the point estimate of the hazard ratio to ≥1.0), 
an  unmeasured  binary  confounder  would  need 
to be present in at least 40% of the control group 
but in less than 25% of each Mediterranean-diet 
group and be associated with a relative risk of 

more than 4 for the primary end point. For fur-
ther details, see Table S25 in the Supplementary 
Appendix.

To  explore  the  effect  of  the  October  2006 
protocol  change  that  was  implemented  for  the 
control  group  to  intensify  nutritional  counsel-
ing, we conducted separate analyses of the par-
ticipants  recruited  before  the  protocol  change 
and  those  recruited  after  the  protocol  change. 
The  hazard  ratios  for  the  Mediterranean  diet 
(both  groups  merged)  as  compared  with  the 
control diet were 0.77 (95% CI, 0.59 to 1.00) for 
the  participants  recruited  before  October  2006 
and  0.49  (95%  CI,  0.26  to  0.92)  for  those  re-
cruited  in  October  2006  or  later  (P = 0.21  for 
heterogeneity).

The per-protocol (adherence-adjusted) hazard 
ratio for the primary end point was 0.42 (95% 
CI, 0.24 to 0.63) for the Mediterranean diet as 
compared with the control diet (Fig. 3); the esti-
mated absolute differences in incidence between 
the  combined  Mediterranean-diet  groups  and

the control group were 0.67, 1.38, and 2.00 per-
centage  points  at  12,  24,  and  36  months  after 
enrollment,  respectively  (see  pages  36  through 
38 in the Supplementary Appendix). The results 
of additional sensitivity and subgroup analyses 
were also consistent with the results of our pri-
mary analyses (Figs. 2 and 3, and Figs. S2, S4, 
and S12 in the Supplementary Appendix).

In this study involving high-risk persons without 
cardiovascular disease, assignment to an energy-
unrestricted  Mediterranean  diet  supplemented 
with either extra-virgin olive oil or nuts was asso-
ciated with a lower risk of major cardiovascular 
events over a period of 5 years than assignment 
to a control (low-fat) diet, with a relative differ-
ence of 30% and an absolute difference of 1.7 to 
2.1 percentage points. Our analysis, which in-
corporated information about adherence to the 
diets,  suggests  that  the  difference  in  rates  of 
cardiovascular events between those assigned to 
the Mediterranean diets and those assigned the 
control diet was greater among participants with 
better adherence. These results support previously 
reported benefits of the Mediterranean diet for 
cardiovascular risk reduction from a randomized 
trial.4,25,26 Our findings are also consistent with 
those  of  previous  observational  studies.2,5,23,25-33 
Table S11 in the Supplementary Appendix sum-
marizes the findings from systematic reviews on 
this issue.

In  response  to  a  2017  report11  suggesting 
that  distributions  of  baseline  variables  in  the 
PREDIMED trial were significantly different from 
what  would  have  been  expected  to  result  from 
randomization, we conducted an extensive review

Figure 2. Sensitivity Analyses of Each Mediterranean-Diet Group and the Control Group.
Shown are hazard ratios for the primary end point in each Mediterranean-diet group as compared with the control 
group, with estimates based on different analytic approaches or exclusions. Hazard ratios were stratified according 
to sex, recruiting site, and educational level (five categories) and (with the exception of the unadjusted intention-to-
treat [ITT] analysis) were adjusted for age, smoking (never smoked, former smoker, or current smoker), hyperten-
sion (yes or no), dyslipidemia (yes or no), diabetes (yes or no), family history of premature coronary heart disease, 
body-mass index (continuous variable), waist-to-height ratio (continuous variable), and physical activity (in quintiles). 
In addition, all multivariable models were adjusted for propensity scores that estimated the probability of assign-
ment to each intervention group on the basis of 30 baseline variables. We used robust standard errors to account 
for intracluster correlations. One analysis excluded all the participants from Site D (652 participants) and all second 
members of the same household (425 participants, including 35 from Site D); in total, 1042 participants were ex-
cluded from this analysis. Another analysis excluded all the participants from Site D (652 participants), all the par-
ticipants from Site B (593 participants), and all second members of the same household (425 participants, includ-
ing 35 from Site D and 47 from Site B); in total, 1588 participants were excluded from this analysis. The results of 
additional sensitivity analyses are shown in Figures S2 and S4 in the Supplementary Appendix.

of the documentation and data at the 11 recruit-
ment sites. After sharing this information with 
the  editors  of  the  Journal,  we  withdrew  our 
original report of this trial and now publish this 
new  report.  Despite  some  departures  from  the 
randomization  protocol,  most  of  the  baseline 
covariates  were  balanced  across  groups,  and 
there was no meaningful difference in the pre-
dicted  risks  of  future  cardiovascular  events 
across the three groups (Fig. S13 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix).

We  reanalyzed  the  data  using  methods  that 
do not rely exclusively on the assumption that all 
the participants had been randomly assigned to 
intervention groups and that adjusted for base-
line characteristics and propensity scores estimat-
ing probabilities of assignment to each interven-
tion on the basis of 30 baseline covariates. The 

results of our reanalyses (Figs. 2 and 3 and Ta-
ble 3, and Figs. S2 and S4 in the Supplementary 
Appendix)  were  similar  to  the  results  that  we 
originally  reported.  In  addition,  reanalyses  of 
our data did not reveal any evidence that certain 
lifestyle or treatment factors that are potentially 
related to the risk of cardiovascular disease either 
biased the results or might provide an alternative 
explanation  for  the  observed  benefits  of  the 
Mediterranean-diet interventions on cardiovascu-
lar disease. Analyses that excluded participants 
whose assignment to an intervention group was 
known  or  suspected  not  to  have  followed  the 
randomization protocol (participants from Sites D 
and B and second household members) yielded 
results  consistent  with  the  results  of  our  pri-
mary analysis.

Figure 3. Sensitivity Analyses of the Combined Mediterranean-Diet Groups and the Control Group.
Shown are hazard ratios for the primary end point in the combined Mediterranean-diet groups as compared with 
the control group, with estimates based on different analytic approaches or exclusions. Hazard ratios were stratified 
according to sex, recruiting site, and educational level (five categories) and (with the exception of the unadjusted 
ITT analysis) were adjusted for age, smoking (never smoked, former smoker, or current smoker), hypertension (yes 
or no), dyslipidemia (yes or no), diabetes (yes or no), family history of premature coronary heart disease, body-mass

assigned to a Mediterranean diet with extra-virgin 
olive oil than in the other two groups (the group 
assigned to a Mediterranean diet with nuts and 
the control group). These two groups were also 
slightly smaller in size, which resulted in a larger 
number of person-years of follow-up in the group 
assigned to a Mediterranean diet with extra-virgin 
olive oil. The different follow-up had the poten-
tial to bias the incidence rates toward lower rates 
in the group assigned to a Mediterranean diet 
with  extra-virgin  olive  oil.  However,  analyses 
that used multiple imputation and inverse-prob-
ability weighting to adjust for a potential selec-
tion bias due to differential losses to follow-up 
yielded estimates consistent with the main analy-
sis (see pages 30 through 35 and Fig. S4 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). An additional limita-
tion of our study is that participants were at high 
cardiovascular risk; whether the results can be 
generalized  to  persons  at  lower  risk  requires 
further research.

As with many clinical trials, the observed rates 
of cardiovascular events were lower than antici-
pated, with reduced statistical power to separately 
assess  components  of  the  primary  end  point. 
However,  favorable  trends  were  seen  for  both 
stroke and myocardial infarction. It is possible, 
but  not  likely,  that  some  cardiovascular  events 
were not detected (see pages 28 and 29 in the 
Supplementary Appendix).

Even though participants in the control group 
received advice to reduce fat intake, changes in 
total  fat  on  the  food-frequency  questionnaire 
were small and the largest differences at the end 
of the study were in the distribution of fat sub-
types. The interventions were intended to im-
prove the overall dietary pattern, but the major 
between-group  differences  involved  the  supple-
mental  items,  extra-virgin  olive  oil  and  nuts. 
Differences were also observed in the consump-
tion of fish and legumes but not in the consump-
tion  of  other  food  groups.  (It  is  worth  noting 
that on the 14-item Mediterranean-diet question-
naire, there were substantial between-group differ-
ences in 12 of the 14 items.) The modest between-
group differences according to the food-frequency 
questionnaire can be explained by the facts that 
most study participants had been consuming a 
baseline diet similar to the study Mediterranean 
diet and that the control group was given recom-
mendations for a healthy diet, factors that raise 
the question of how applicable our results may be 
to high-risk persons in other countries. Answer-
ing this question will require further research.3
In conclusion, in this primary prevention study 
involving persons at high risk for cardiovascular 
events, those assigned to an energy-unrestricted 
Mediterranean  diet,  supplemented  with  extra-
virgin olive oil or nuts, had a lower rate of major 
cardiovascular events than those assigned to a
