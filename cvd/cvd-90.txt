ABSTRACT
Background: Epidemiologic studies report inconsistent findings
on the association of fruit and vegetable intake with the risk of
cardiovascular disease.
Objective: The  objective  was  to  examine  the  relation  between
fruit and vegetable intake and the risk of cardiovascular disease.
Design: We studied 9608 adults aged 25–74 y participating in the
ﬁrst National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey Epidemio-
logic Follow-up Study and free of cardiovascular disease at the time
of  their  baseline  examination  between  1971  and  1975.  Fruit  and
vegetable  intake  at  baseline  was  measured  with  a  food-frequency
questionnaire. The incidence of and mortality from cardiovascular
disease were obtained from medical records and death certiﬁcates.
Results: Over  an  average  of  19  y, 888  strokes  (218  fatal),
1786 ischemic heart disease events (639 fatal), 1145 cardiovascular
disease deaths, and 2530 all-cause deaths were documented. Con-
suming fruit and vegetables ≥ 3 times/d compared with < 1 time/d
was associated with a 27% lower stroke incidence [relative risk
(RR): 0.73; 95% CI: 0.57, 0.95; P for trend = 0.01), a 42% lower
stroke  mortality  (0.58;  0.33, 1.02;  P for  trend = 0.05), a  24%
lower  ischemic  heart  disease  mortality  (0.76;  0.56, 1.03;  P for
trend = 0.07), a  27%  lower  cardiovascular  disease  mortality
(0.73; 0.58, 0.92; P for trend = 0.008), and a 15% lower all-cause
mortality (0.85; 0.72, 1.00; P for trend = 0.02) after adjustment
for established cardiovascular disease risk factors.
Conclusion: We showed an inverse association of fruit and veg-
etable  intake  with  the  risk  of  cardiovascular  disease  and  all-
cause  mortality  in  the  general  US  population.

INTRODUCTION

Observational epidemiologic studies have suggested that dietary
nutrients such as potassium, antioxidants, and folic acid—abundant in
fruit  and  vegetables—are  associated  with  a  lower  incidence  of  and
mortality  from  cardiovascular  disease  (1–3).  The  few  prospective
cohort studies that have examined the relation of fruit and vegetable
intake with cardiovascular disease have reported inconsistent ﬁndings

(4, 5). A review identiﬁed 6 cohort studies that examined the associa-
tion of fruit and vegetable intake (rather than nutrient intakes) with the
risk of cardiovascular disease (4). Most of these studies reported no
association or a nonsigniﬁcant inverse association between fruit and
vegetable intake and the risk of cardiovascular disease.

National and international recommendations aimed at increas-
ing fruit and vegetable intake further support the need to evaluate
the relation between intake of these foods and cardiovascular dis-
ease (6, 7). Nutritional recommendations are easier to understand
and follow when phrased in terms of foods rather than nutrients.
We took advantage of the large sample size and prolonged follow-
up experience of participants in the National Health and Nutrition
Examination  Survey  Epidemiologic  Follow-up  Study  (NHEFS)
to examine the association between fruit and vegetable intake and
the risk of subsequent cardiovascular disease.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS

Study population

The NHEFS is an ongoing prospective cohort study of partic-
ipants  in  the  first  National  Health  and  Nutrition  Examination
Survey (NHANES I) aged 25–74 y at the time of their baseline
examination  between  1971  and  1975.  Of  the  14 407  persons
followed in the NHEFS, we excluded 1020 who self-reported a
history of heart attack, heart failure, or stroke at baseline; 327 per-
sons who  had  used  medication  for  heart  disease  during  the
preceding 6 mo; 2853 NHANES I Augmentation Survey partici-
pants who were not administered a dietary assessment (8); and

214  who  lacked  information  on  fruit  and  vegetable  intake.
Among the remaining participants, 385 (3.9%) were lost to fol-
low-up, leaving 9608 participants who contributed 159304 person-
years of follow-up.

Measurements

Baseline  data  collection  included  a  medical  history, a  stan-
dardized medical examination, a dietary assessment, laboratory
tests, and anthropometric measurements (8, 9). Blood pressure,
body weight, and height were obtained with the use of standard
protocols. The baseline questionnaire on medical history included
questions about selected health conditions and medications used
for those conditions during the preceding 6 mo. Data on educa-
tion  level, physical  activity, and  alcohol  consumption  were
obtained  by  interviewer-administered  questionnaires.  Baseline
information on smoking status was obtained in 6913 NHANES I
participants.  For  the  remaining  study  participants, information
on  smoking  status  at  baseline  was  derived  from  responses  to
questions on lifetime smoking history at follow-up interviews in
1982 through 1984 or later.

The dietary assessment included a 3-mo food-frequency ques-
tionnaire  about  the  participants’ usual  consumption  of  food
groups in 13 major categories, including 3 items referring to fruit
and vegetable intake. The primary item used in this investigation
asked  participants  how  often  “fruits  and  vegetables  of  all  kinds
fresh, canned, frozen, cooked, or  raw, and  juices” were  usually
consumed in the past 3 mo, excluding periods of illness or diet-
ing. Frequency of consumption of fruit and vegetables was coded
into categories ranging from never to 8 times/d. Information on
portion size was not collected. Frequency of consumption of meat
and poultry and of fish and shellfish were also obtained from the
food-frequency  questionnaire.  Preceding  the  food-frequency
questionnaire, a single 24-h dietary recall was collected by trained
personnel using a standardized protocol and food-portion models.
Interviewers coded the dietary-recall questionnaires using nutri-
ent  information  from  the  US  Department  of Agriculture  Hand-
book  No.  8 (10)  or  other  resources.  Total  energy  intakes  were
calculated for each participant by the National Center for Health
Statistics.  Details  of  the  data  collection  procedures  at  baseline
were described elsewhere (8, 9).

Follow-up procedures

Follow-up data were collected in 1982–1984, 1986, 1987, and
1992  (11).  Incident  cardiovascular  disease  was  based  on  docu-
mentation  of  an  event  that  met  prespecified  study  criteria  and
occurred during the period between the baseline examination and
the last follow-up interview. Mortality from cardiovascular dis-
ease was based on information from death certificates. The valid-
ity  of  study  outcome  data  from  both  sources  was  documented
previously (12).

Incident  stroke  was  based  on  a  death  certificate  report  in
which the underlying cause of death was recorded as an Inter-
national Classification of Diseases, ninth revision (ICD-9; 13),
code of 430–438, or on a hospital or nursing home stay in which
the participant had a discharge diagnosis with the above codes.
Incident ischemic heart disease was defined in the same manner
as  ICD-9  codes  410–414.  Cause-specific  mortality  was  identi-
fied on the basis of the underlying cause of death with the use
of  the  above-mentioned  ICD-9  codes  for  stroke  and  ischemic
heart disease and ICD-9 codes 390–459 to define cardiovascu-
lar disease.

Statistical analysis

To corroborate the fruit and vegetable intake data from the 3-mo
food-frequency  questionnaire, we  used  Spearman  rank-order
correlation analysis to compare the data with data from the 24-h
dietary recall. Fruit and vegetable intake was grouped into 4 cat-
egories by intake (< 1 time/d, 1 time/d, 2 times/d, and ≥ 3 times/d)
to identify discrete levels of consumption and to provide a suf-
ficient  number  of  participants  at  risk  in  each  category.  For
each  baseline  characteristic, the  mean  or  percentage  of  study
participants was calculated by category of fruit and vegetable
intake.  The  statistical  significance  of  differences  was  exam-
ined by using analysis of variance (continuous variables) and
the  chi-square  test  (categorical  variables).  The  cumulative
incidence of and mortality from cardiovascular disease by cat-
egory  of  fruit  and  vegetable  intake  were  calculated  by  using
the Kaplan-Meier method (14), and differences in cumulative
rates  were  examined  by  the  log-rank  test  for  trend  (15).  Cox
proportional  hazards  regression  models  were  used  to  explore
the  relation  between  categories  of  fruit  and  vegetable  intake
and  the  risk  of  cardiovascular  disease  (16).  The  multivariate
models were adjusted for physical activity (3 categories), edu-
cation  level  (completed  or  did  not  complete  high  school),
regular  alcohol  consumption  (4  categories), current  cigarette
smoking at baseline (yes or no), vitamin supplement use (yes
or no), total energy intake (continuously), sex, race, and dia-
betic status (yes or no). Age was used as the time scale in all
time-to-event analyses (17), and all analyses were stratified by
birth cohort to control for calendar period and cohort effects (17).
Estimation methods taking into account sample clustering and
stratification of the NHANES I were used (17, 18). Data from
the small number of participants who had reached 85 y of age
were censored.

RESULTS

The baseline characteristics of the study participants by cate-
gory  of  fruit  and  vegetable  intake  are  presented  in  Table  1.
Compared  with  participants  who  had  lower  fruit  and  vegetable
intakes, those with higher intakes tended to be white and female.
The mean (± SD) serving size of fruit and vegetables consumed
in  this  cohort  calculated  from  the  24-h  dietary  recall  was
106.2 ± 89.9 g/d. A Spearman rank-order correlation coefficient
of 0.50 was obtained for the comparison of fruit and vegetable
intake derived from the food-frequency questionnaires and 24-h
dietary recalls.

Over  159 304  person-years  of  follow-up  between  1971  and
1992, 888 stroke events (218 fatal), 1786 ischemic heart disease
events  (639  fatal), 1145  cardiovascular  disease  deaths, and
2530 deaths from all causes were documented. The cumulative
mortality  from  stroke, ischemic  heart  disease, cardiovascular
disease, and all causes by category of fruit and vegetable intake
is  shown  in  Figure  1. The  cumulative  mortality  from  stroke  at
age 85 y by increasing category of fruit and vegetable intake was
14.5%, 9.8%, 8.8%, and 6.1% (P for trend < 0.001). The corre-
sponding cumulative mortality from ischemic heart disease was
32.0%, 25.4%, 23.6%, and  21.5%  (P for  trend  <  0.001);  from
cardiovascular  disease  was  51.2%, 42.1%, 38.8%, and  32.7%
(P for  trend  <  0.001);  and  from  all  causes  was  79.3%, 69.1%,
64.0%, and  60.4%  (P for  trend  <  0.001).  The  cumulative  inci-
dence of stroke at age 85 y from the lowest to the highest fre-
quency of fruit and vegetable intake was 42.8%, 37.8%, 34.1%,

from  ischemic  heart  disease  was  62.4%, 59.7%, 54.4%, and
54.3% (P for trend < 0.001) (Figure 2).

The relative risks (RRs) and 95% CIs for cardiovascular dis-
eases  according  to  frequency  of  fruit  and  vegetable  intake  are
presented in Table 2. After adjustment for age, race, sex, history
of  diabetes, physical  activity, education  level, regular  alcohol
consumption, current  smoking, vitamin  supplement  use, and
total  energy  intake, intake  of  fruit  and  vegetables  ≥ 3  times/d
compared  with  < 1  time/d  was  associated  with  a  27%  lower
incidence  of  stroke  (RR: 0.73;  95%  CI: 0.57, 0.95;  P for
trend = 0.01), a  42%  lower  mortality  from  stroke  (0.58;  0.33,
1.02; P for trend = 0.05), a 24% lower mortality from ischemic
heart disease (0.76; 0.56, 1.03; P for trend = 0.07), a 27% lower
mortality  from  cardiovascular  disease  (0.73;  0.58, 0.92;  P for
trend = 0.008), and a 15% lower mortality from all causes (0.85;
0.72, 1.00; P for trend = 0.02).

The RRs of cardiovascular disease for participants who con-
sumed  fruit  and  vegetables  ≥ 3  times/d  compared  with  those
who  consumed  them  < 1  time/d—in  models  individually
adjusted  for  other  dietary  variables, serum  cholesterol, blood
pressure, or  body  mass  index—are  shown  in  Table  3. Adjust-
ment for the frequency of consumption of meat and fish mini-
mally changed the point estimates and at the same time widened
the  95%  CIs  such  that  the  RR  was  significant  only  for  stroke
incidence.  After  adjustment  for  serum  cholesterol, the  RR  of

mortality from ischemic heart disease was further away from the
null and was significant. When adjusted for systolic blood pres-
sure, the RRs of most outcomes diminished and the RRs of mor-
tality  from  stroke  were  no  longer  significant.  Adjustment  for
body  mass  index  produced  little  change  in  the  RRs  and  95%
CIs.  The  results  of  models  adjusted  simultaneously  for  total
serum cholesterol, systolic blood pressure, and body mass index
were similar to those adjusted for systolic blood pressure alone.
The inverse associations between frequency of fruit and veg-
etable  intake  and  incidence  of  and  mortality  from  stroke,
ischemic  heart  disease, and  cardiovascular  disease  were  gener-
ally  consistent  across  strata  of  age  and  sex, and  no  significant
interactions were detected even though the associations differed
somewhat  by  race  (Table  4).  Risk  estimates  were  not  signifi-
cantly different across strata of smoking status, diabetic status,
vitamin use, and physical activity (data not shown).

DISCUSSION

This  study  shows  a  strong  inverse  association  between  fruit
and  vegetable  intake  and  the  risk  of  subsequent  cardiovascular
disease. These findings have important clinical and public health
implications.  Increased  fruit  and  vegetable  intakes  have  been
recommended  to  prevent  morbidity  and  mortality  from  cardio-
vascular disease (6, 7). Our findings provide additional evidence
to support this recommendation.

FIGURE 1. Age-adjusted cumulative mortality from stroke, ischemic heart disease, cardiovascular disease, and all causes according to frequency of
fruit and vegetable intake in 9608 participants in the ﬁrst National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey Epidemiologic Follow-up Study (P for trend
< 0.0001 for all outcomes, log-rank test).

The data on fruit and vegetable intake from the food-frequency
questionnaire showed very good agreement with the data from the
24-h dietary recall. The Spearman rank-order correlation coeffi-
cient  of  0.5  obtained  in  our  study  compares  favorably  with  the
value of 0.31 obtained for vegetables by Ocke et al (19) and of
0.48  obtained  for  vegetables  by  Bohlscheid-Thomas  et  al  (20).
Food-frequency questionnaires provide a better measure of usual
food intake than does a single 24-h dietary recall. In our study, the
comparison of the mean fruit and vegetable intake reported on the
24-h dietary recall with that reported on the food-frequency ques-
tionnaire  suggested  that  persons  reporting  an  intake  < 1  time/d
may  have  underestimated  their  usual  intake.  It  is  possible  that
such measurement error would shift our RR estimates toward the
null  value;  however, fruit  and  vegetable  intake  may  be  biased
toward the overall mean when estimated by frequency categories.
Recent  prospective  studies  report  an  inverse  association
between fruit and vegetable intake and the risk of ischemic stroke
and ischemic heart disease (21–25). In a study of 832 men from
Framingham, MA, Gillman  et  al  (21)  found  that  an  increase  of
3 servings/d of fruit and vegetables was associated with an RR of
0.75  (95%  CI: 0.55, 1.03)  for  ischemic  stroke.  In  the  Nurses’
Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study, per-
sons in the highest quintile of fruit and vegetable intake (median:
5.1 servings/d among men and 5.8 servings/d among women) had
an  RR  of  stroke  of  0.69  (95%  CI: 0.52, 0.92)  and  of  ischemic
heart disease of 0.80 (95% CI: 0.69, 0.93) compared with the low-
est quintile (22, 23). Our study extends these findings in several
ways. First, our study was conducted in a representative sample
of the US population; therefore, the results are broadly applica-
ble. In contrast, most previous studies were conducted in popula-

tions  that  probably  had  food  habits  different  from  those  of  the
general population. For instance, the median intake of fruit and
vegetables in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study and the
Nurses’ Health  Study  was  well  above  the  national  and  interna-
tional recommendation of 5 servings/d (6, 7, 22, 23). Differences
in the dietary assessment methods used in these studies may also
have  contributed  to  the  differences  in  measured  intakes  of  fruit
and  vegetables.  In  addition, our  study  examined  the  relation
between fruit and vegetable intake and stroke incidence and mor-
tality, ischemic heart disease incidence and mortality, cardiovas-
cular disease mortality, noncardiovascular disease mortality, and
all-cause mortality rather than the incidence of stroke or ischemic
heart disease alone.

In  the  current  study, fruit  and  vegetable  intake  was  signifi-
cantly associated with lower mortality from ischemic heart dis-
ease;  however,
the  same  was  not  true  for  the  incidence  of
ischemic  heart  disease.  One  possibility  for  this  finding  is  that
mortality as an endpoint may be more accurately assessed than is

incidence. The cases identified by this method are by definition
the  most  severe  and  tend  to  be  more  homogeneous  than  those
identified by self-report or proxy, either alone or in combination
with hospital discharge data and death certificate information. In
the NHEFS cohort, it was shown that the use of cases identified
from  death  certificate  information  alone  produces  higher  esti-
mates of RRs and wider 95% CIs (12). Another possibility is that
fruit and vegetable intake may reduce the case-fatality rate after
a  myocardial  infarction, thus  resulting  in  stronger  associations
with mortality than with incidence. Such a relation may not exist
with stroke. In addition, our findings suggest that the protective
association of fruit and vegetable intake with cardiovascular dis-
ease  may  be  related  to  blood  pressure.  This  fact  could  explain
why  previous  studies  found  a  strong  association  between  fruit
and vegetable intake and the risk of stroke. A multicenter clini-
cal trial with a heterogeneous population showed that a diet rich
in  fruit, vegetables, and  low-fat  dairy  products  reduces  blood
pressure  (26).  Our  results  are  consistent  with  this  finding  and

support the role of a diet rich in fruit and vegetables as a possi-
ble approach for preventing cardiovascular disease.

Another study, conducted by van’t Veer et al (27), attempted
to quantify the public health benefit of increased fruit and veg-
etable intake as a means to prevent cardiovascular disease. They
performed  a  meta-analysis  using  results  from  14  observational

epidemiologic studies of cardiovascular disease (3 case-control
and 11 prospective studies) published through 1998 to calculate
the pooled relative risk and the preventable proportion of cardio-
vascular  disease  deaths.  In  that  study, an  increase  in  fruit  and
vegetable  intake  of  150  g/d  was  associated  with  a  16%  lower
mortality from cardiovascular disease.

FRUIT AND VEGETABLE INTAKE AND RISK OF CVD

99

Our  ﬁnding  of  a  27%  lower  cardiovascular  disease  mortality
with the consumption of fruit and vegetables ≥ 3 times/d compared
with < 1 time/d (a difference of 278 g/d), calculated from a 24-h
dietary recall, was consistent with the ﬁnding of van’t Veer et al.
Law and Morris (5) conducted a meta-analytic review of 11 cohort
studies  of  fruit  and  vegetable  consumption  or  a  nutrient  marker.
They found an estimated reduction in the RR of 15% for a contrast
between the 90th and 10th percentiles of 6 dietary markers of fruit
and vegetable consumption. Although our results are not directly
comparable, they are compatible with those of Law and Morris.

Persons consuming fruit and vegetables frequently are likely to
have other healthy habits, ie, exercise regularly, do not smoke cig-
arettes, and have a low dietary intake of cholesterol and saturated
fat. In our study population, the dietary intake of saturated fat was
not associated with fruit and vegetable intake. In addition, the esti-
mates of risk we present were adjusted for important potential con-
founders  of  cardiovascular  disease, such  as, race, sex, education
level, physical  activity, cigarette  smoking, regular  alcohol  con-
sumption, and diabetes status. The associations between fruit and
vegetable intake and risk of cardiovascular disease were consistent
with  our  main  ﬁndings  in  both  direction  and  magnitude  across
strata  of  vitamin  use, smoking  status, and  level  of  recreational
activity, all of which are markers of a healthy lifestyle. These ﬁnd-
ings generally indicate that the association of fruit and vegetable
intake with a lower risk of cardiovascular disease and total mortal-
ity may not be the result of confounding by other health habits.

Several  individual  nutrients,

including  potassium, antioxi-
dants, and  folic  acid—which  are  abundant  in  fruit  and  vegeta-
bles—may contribute to the inverse association of the intake of
these foods with the risk of stroke and mortality from cardiovas-
cular  disease  (1–3, 28). Although  each  of  these  nutrients  may
play a protective role in the prevention of cardiovascular disease,
their  effect  in  combination  with  those  of  other  components  in
whole foods may have a greater effect. Although every effort was
made  to  isolate  the  effects  of  fruit  and  vegetables  alone, the
results presented herein may also pertain to a dietary pattern rich
in  fruit  and  vegetables.  Consequently, the  role  of  foods  and
dietary patterns and the role of specific nutrients in the preven-
tion of cardiovascular disease should be investigated.

In conclusion, this study indicates that the frequency of fruit and
vegetable intake is inversely associated with stroke incidence, stroke
mortality, ischemic  heart  disease  mortality, cardiovascular  disease
mortality, and  all-cause  mortality  in  the  general  US  population.
Nutrients  in  whole  foods, such  as  fruit  and  vegetables, may  have
additive  and  synergistic  effects  not  available  through  dietary  sup-
plementation.  In  addition, this  study  provides  additional  evidence
for recommendations to increase fruit and vegetable intakes as part
of a dietary approach to prevent cardiovascular disease.
