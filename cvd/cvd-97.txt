Abstract

Chronic heart failure is a complex catabolic state that carries a devastating prognosis. The transition from stable disease to cardiac cachexia is
not well understood. Mechanisms that maintain the wasting process involve neurohormones and pro-inflammatory cytokines, which contribute
to an imbalance in anabolic and catabolic pathways. A decrease in food intake alone rarely triggers the development of a wasting process, but
dietary deficiencies in micronutrients and macronutrients contribute to the progression of the disease. Malabsorption from the gut as a result of
bowel wall edema and decreased bowel perfusion also plays an important role. This article describes the complex interplay of hormonal systems
in energy balance in patients with chronic heart failure as well as other factors such as malabsorption and dietary deficiencies that contribute to
the wasting process. Finally, therapeutic approaches are discussed. These include dietary advice, ongoing studies, and future possibilities.

1. Introduction

Chronic heart failure (CHF) is a major public health pro-
blem in western countries. CHF carries a devastating
prognosis which resembles that of some types of malignant
cancer [1]. Its incidence rises steadily from 0.02 per 1000
population per year in those aged 25 to 34 years to 11.6 in
those aged 85 years or older [2]. Despite substantial improve-
ments in the management of the disease,
the prognosis
remains poor especially in advanced stages of the disease.
About half the patients diagnosed with CHF die within
4 years of diagnosis [3]. The prognosis worsens considerably
once cardiac cachexia has been diagnosed. Importantly, the
occurrence of cachexia establishes a poor prognosis in
patients with CHF, independently of whether the heart failure
is regarded as mild or advanced. Mortality at 18 months in
unselected patients with CHF in whom cardiac cachexia had

been diagnosed was as high as 50% compared to 17% in non-
cachectic patients from the same study population [4].
However, cachexia is not a unique feature of CHF, but is
also seen in terminal stages of other chronic illnesses,
including cancer, sepsis, rheumatoid arthritis, and AIDS.
Consequently, the pathophysiology of cachexia in CHF is to
some degree similar to that of cachexia in other illnesses.

The transition from clinically and body weight stable,
ambulatory CHF to cardiac cachexia is not well understood,
and the timelines differ widely between patients. Up to 68%
of patients with CHF have evidence of muscle atrophy [5].
Osteoporosis has also been observed in advanced stages of
CHF [6]. Profound metabolic perturbations, initially meant to
isolate and neutralize the insult, contribute to the develop-
ment and the progression of cardiac cachexia. Cellular
hypoxia, possibly a consequence of the activation of neuro-
hormones and cytokines, as well as nutritional factors cer-
tainly plays an important part.

The aim of this review is to provide an overview of
nutritional aspects that contribute to the wasting progress and

to summarize available data on micronutrient and macronu-
trient supplementation in CHF and cardiac cachexia. Further-
more, we describe the complex interplay between metabolic
and neurohormonal systems involved in appetite and
substrate utilization and finally give dietary and therapeutic
recommendations for patients with CHF with and without
cardiac cachexia.

1.1. Aging and energy expenditure

In human beings, significant changes in body composi-
tion occur during the aging process. It has been estimated
that elderly persons lose between 0.1 and 0.3 kg of lean body
mass per year [7,8]. Simultaneously, lipid stores increase
contributing to a net increase in body weight [9]. This is the
‘normal’ pathophysiology of aging. Total energy expenditure
declines with aging: at age 75 a much lower daily energy
intake is needed to maintain weight compared to the age 20,
even if the level of physical activity remains the same [10].
The resting energy expenditure accounts for approximately
60–75% of the total energy expenditure. Resting energy
expenditure is increased in some, but not all patients with
CHF [11–13]. This might be due to an increased cardiac and
ventilatory work, and an increased resting peripheral oxygen
consumption [14]. Thus, CHF shows a number of catabolic
features that can ultimately lead to cardiac cachexia. A major
obstacle for the development of effective therapies is the fact
that many different – and redundant – pathways are involved
in the development of this syndrome.

2. Definition of cardiac cachexia

It is important to differentiate cachexia from malnutrition
and anorexia. In contrast to cachexia, both are reversible once
food is supplied. With these perturbations, weight loss is the
result of fat mass being consumed for energy yield while
muscle mass is mostly spared. There is currently no agree-
ment on how to define cachexia. Cachectic CHF patients not
only lose muscle mass, but they also have reductions in total
fat mass and bone mineral density [15]. A multitude of
definitions have been used in different studies, which make it
difficult to reconcile study results from different groups of
workers. In cardiac cachexia, the presence of edema further
complicates the assessment of weight loss, which highlights
the importance to assess changes in body weight in the non-
edematous state. Established measures of disease severity in
CHF, for example, left ventricular ejection fraction, New
York Heart Association (NYHA) disease severity class, or
exercise duration are not strongly associated with the severity
of cachexia [16]. In two independent studies we showed that
the presence of cachexia in CHF is not associated with
structural cardiac changes as assessed by echocardiography
[17] or magnetic resonance imaging [18].

The defining clinical characteristic of cachexia is the
process of losing weight. This has two consequences, first
that weight loss of a defined degree and possibly over a

defined time-course should be part of any cachexia definition,
and second, that any treatment for cachexia should be able to
stabilise or even increase body weight to be considered as
“anti-cachexia therapy”. Using data from the Studies of Left
Ventricular Dysfunction (SOLVD) database, Anker et al.
suggested a definition for cardiac cachexia as documented
non-edematous weight loss of N6% of the previous normal
weight observed over a period of N6 months [19]. This
definition was validated based on the assumption that a “best”
definition should provide the highest sensitivity–specificity-
product to predict subsequent mortality. In this context, the
average weight prior to the onset of heart disease should be
used as the previous normal weight.

3. Neurohormonal and immune activation

CHF is a complex catabolic state. A number of different
mechanisms maintain the wasting process, most of which were
found to be activated early in the development of CHF. Many of
these pathways are initially activated to protect the heart and the
circulation from damage and to compensate for impaired
myocardial function. Mediators that have been implicated in this
process include pro-inflammatory cytokines, catecholamines,
cortisol, natriuretic peptides, and heat shock proteins [15,20].
Activation of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone–system
tends to follow the activation of pro-inflammatory cytokines
in the course of CHF [21]. Whilst the first system is directed
at maintaining renal and organ perfusion, the activation of the
immune system is only incompletely understood. Elevated
plasma levels of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) were first
observed in cardiac cachexia in 1990 by Levine and collea-
gues [22]. Other pro-inflammatory cytokines including
interleukin (IL)-1 and IL-6 are also activated. The activation
of TNF-α is one of the candidates that has been suggested as a
final common pathway in all forms of cachexia. TNF-α
induces apoptosis via specific receptors on the cell surface
and activates proteasome-dependent protein breakdown in
striate muscle and other tissues thus maintaining the wasting
process [23]. In CHF, plasma levels of soluble TNF-α recep-
tors are associated with a poor long- and short-term prognosis
[24,25]. TNF-α is partially responsible for decreased blood
supply to skeletal muscles as it worsens endothelial dys-
function [26]. This, in turn, yields reduced exercise en-
durance and lack of nutrient supply. However, direct
antagonism of TNF-α in patients with CHF has largely failed
in clinical trials [27]. But for many reasons this may not mean
that anti-cytokine therapy may not be of benefit in CHF, if
restricted to patients with evidence of inflammation [28].

The pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 most potently
induces the acute phase response [29], whose maintenance
requires an excess of essential amino acids. The need for
amino acids yields loss of body proteins [30]. Because ske-
letal muscle accounts for almost half of the body's protein
mass, this compartment is intensively affected. Moreover,
both TNF-α and IL-6 are known to down-regulate albumin
synthesis in the liver [31]. Both TNF-α and IL-1 are involved

in the inhibition of food intake [32]. The mechanisms behind
this action await to be elucidated in more detail, however, it
appears that circulating TNF-α and IL-1 act, at least in part,
directly on the brain [32]. Interestingly, the permeability of
the blood–brain barrier is increased by these cytokines
which thus promote their own uptake [33]. Peripheral intra-
venous injection of IL-1 activates a number of regions in the
central nervous system that control eating behaviour [34].
Moreover, TNF-α increases the expression of the catabolic
hormone leptin [35,36], whereas IL-1 has been shown to
reduce hypothalamic mRNA levels of the food intake sti-
mulating neurotransmitter neuropeptide Y (see below) [37].

4. Nutrition and neurohormones

A multitude of nutritional factors contribute to the path-
ogenesis of cardiac cachexia. These include alterations in
food intake and appetite, an imbalance between anabolic and
catabolic factors, as well as malabsorption in the gut. Lack of
appetite alone can lead to malnourishment in up to 50% of
patients with chronic illnesses, and this can certainly pro-
gress to anorexia-mediated cachexia. An adequate nutritional
status is critical in providing patients with the means to
recover from their illness and to withstand the detrimental
metabolic effects of aggressive therapies [38].

4.1. Imbalance between anabolic and catabolic pathways

Numerous hormone systems contribute to the wasting
process by altering appetite and energy expenditure as shown
in Fig. 1. The derangement of these hormone systems, poten-
tially triggered by the effects of pro-inflammatory cytokines
[39], may be responsible for the development of satiety with-
out adequate food intake.

4.1.1. Growth hormone

Growth hormone (GH) is a 191 amino acid peptide hor-
mone released from the pituitary gland. This hormone exerts
pleitropic actions on both growth and maturation of the body
during the life span as well as on short-term regulation of
energetic flux. Its anabolic effect and increased stimulation
upon all types of stress and energy expenditure may be
viewed as a regulative effort to restore and built up energy
stores. GH exerts direct lipolytic effects, but its major mode
of action is indirect and anabolic through the activation of the
somatomedins and particularly through insulin-like growth
factor-1 (IGF-1) [9]. IGF-1 is produced mainly by the liver
but also by peripheral tissues [40]. GH levels have been found
to be increased threefold in cachectic patients with CHF
compared to non-cachectic and healthy subjects [16]. IGF-1,
was found to be reduced in CHF and particularly so in
cachectic CHF patients [41]. This biochemical condition
indicates presence of acquired GH resistance, that has been
observed in numerous catabolic diseases such as sepsis,
trauma, surgery, cancer but also in chronic obstructive pul-
monary disease, uremia, chronic liver disease and CHF [42].
GH resistance may explain why GH treatment failed to
improve clinical status of patients with CHF due to dilated
cardiomyopathy in randomized trials [43–45]. However,
individual responses to GH had not been tested before en-
rolment in these trials. Thus, GH treatment might be un-
suitable for unselected patients because individual GH
responsiveness may vary considerably.

Theoretical possibilities to overcome GH resistance have
been suggested. These include altered dosing regimens, the
combination of GH with IGF-1 or the testing for individual
GH responsiveness. Applying the latter option would mean
to use GH therapy as a tailored option only in those in-
dividuals eligible. Whether there is a future for GH therapy

in CHF is unclear and further studies have been discouraged
by the data described above.

4.1.2. Neuropeptide Y

Neuropeptide Y is a 36-amino acid peptide with a mole-
cular weight of 10.8 kDa that was initially discovered in 1982
[46]. It functions as a neurotransmitter and neuromodulator in
the central and peripheral nervous system [47]. Its main site
of accumulation is the hypothalamus. Neuropeptide Y is a
potent stimulator of food intake. Therefore, its secretion in the
hypothalamus is induced during fasting. Moreover, neuro-
peptide Y potently induces corticotropin-releasing factor,
which results in the release of ACTH and cortisol (Fig. 1).
Only small amounts of neuropeptide Y cross the blood–
brain barrier. The peptide is co-released with norepinephrine
from sympathetic nerves and causes vasoconstriction. A
study in 30 patients with CHF found elevated plasma levels
of neuropeptide Y compared to 16 healthy controls (p b 0.01)
[48]. Patients with an LVEF b 20% had similar plasma values
like those with an LVEF of 20–35% [48]. Intravenous in-
fusion of neuropeptide Y in seven healthy volunteers had no
effect on central hemodynamic parameters [49].

4.1.3. Leptin

Leptin is a 16 kDa protein hormone with a direct inhibitory
effect on neuropeptide Y. Thus, it exerts central effects on food
intake and body energy balance. Its existence had originally
been suggested from mutant mouse models (ob/ob mouse) and
parabiosis experiments in the 1950's, but it was only in 1994
that the ob gene product had been identified [50], which had
subsequently been termed leptin (from Greek “leptos”, thin).
Leptin is exclusively secreted from adipocytes [51]. In fact, it
was the first adipocyte-derived hormone to be discovered, and
its existence proved that fat tissue is actively involved in
metabolic signalling rather that being a mere energy depot.
Later studies identified other substances derived from adip-
ocytes such as adiponectin. Leptin crosses the blood–brain
barrier, and it was initially believed to be an inhibiting feed-
back link between adipose tissue and the central regulation of
satiety and body composition (Fig. 1). Recent studies, how-
ever, demonstrated that leptin receptors are also expressed in
several peripheral
liver,
kidney, lung, skeletal muscle, and bone marrow suggesting a
role in the periphery as well [52–54]. Importantly, leptin
affects the balance of several metabolic and hormonal path-
ways, such as insulin sensitivity [55], GH signalling [56], and
lipogenesis in adipose tissue. Leptin and adiponectin appear to
work together in sensitizing peripheral tissues to insulin [57].
Leptin itself is under multihormonal control (via insulin,
glucocorticoids, catecholamines), and its serum levels in
women are higher than in men [58].

tissues such as pancreatic islets,

Being secreted from fat tissue, circulating leptin levels
depend on the amount of fat tissue. Its main purpose is to
control and maintain the balance of energy stores (i.e. fat
depots). Accordingly, increased leptin release leads to a
reduction in food intake and increases in energy expenditure

through increased thermogenesis and physical activity. Food
deprivation yields a rapid fall in leptin release. A 10%
reduction in body weight leads to a 53% reduction in serum
leptin levels in obese subjects [59]. Conversely, an increase
in body weight by 10% results in a 300% increase in serum
leptin levels [59].

In CHF, the amount of fat tissue similarly predicts leptin
serum levels [13]. Disease related factors might, however,
affect the balanced feed-back regulation as elevated leptin
levels have been reported in CHF patients [55,60,61]. Lower
levels of leptin in cachectic compared to non-cachectic patients
might be expected in view of the reduced amount of fat tissue
in cachectic patients. This has been confirmed in a number of
studies [56,62,63]. Some controversy remains about leptin
levels in CHF, because other studies reported normal leptin
levels compared to controls [64]. This might be due to the
selection of study subjects as these were different regarding
sex distribution and the presence of cachexia between studies
[65]. Leptin should therefore be normalized for fat tissue
amount for comparison of study populations. Accordingly, the
leptin levels in cachectic CHF patients were suggested to be
viewed as “pseudo-normal” leptin levels. When fat tissue
normalized leptin levels were analysed, both non-cachectic
and cachectic CHF patients were found to be hyperleptinemic
[55]. In any case, it appears that leptin levels in cachectic CHF
are not higher than in non-cachectic patients, which argues
against reduced appetite and food intake to be of particular
importance for the development of cardiac cachexia.

4.1.4. Ghrelin

Ghrelin, originally identified in 1999 [66], is a 12.9 kDa
peptide containing 28 amino acids. Ghrelin stimulates the
secretion of growth hormone. It is predominantly produced by
the stomach, although bowel, pancreas, kidney, hypothalamus
and other tissues also contribute to its plasma concentration
[67]. Ghrelin plays an important role in hunger and meal
initiation. Ghrelin plasma levels rise with food deprivation
causing increases in food intake and weight gain through
increases in fat mass and decreases in fat use [68,69]. Healthy
volunteers treated with ghrelin report hunger sensations [67].
On the other hand, ghrelin blocks leptin-mediated decreases in
food intake. Not surprisingly, ghrelin levels are negatively
correlated with body mass index (BMI) and body fat content
[70], and ghrelin levels usually increase after weight loss.

Nagaya et al. studied plasma ghrelin levels in 28 cachectic
(mean NYHA 3.3 ± 0.1, LVEF 27 ± 1%, BMI 17.9 ± 0.4 kg/
m2) and 46 non-cachectic (NYHA 3.0 ± 0.1, LVEF 29 ± 1%,
BMI 22.7 ± 0.7 kg/m2) patients with CHF [71]. Cachectic
patients presented with significantly higher levels of plasma
ghrelin than non-cachectic patients (p b 0.001) [71]. Plasma
ghrelin levels in this study correlated significantly with
plasma levels of growth hormone (r = 0.28, p b 0.05) and
TNF-α (r = 0.31, p b 0.05) [71]. Ten patients who developed
cardiac cachexia during a mean follow-up of 12 ± 1 months
showed significant
increases in plasma ghrelin levels
(p b 0.05) [71].

S. von Haehling et al. / Cardiovascular Research 73 (2007) 298–309

A small, uncontrolled study of intravenous infusion of
ghrelin showed promising results [72]. In this study, 10 pa-
tients with CHF, predominantly cachectic patients in NYHA
class III, were treated with ghrelin at a dose of 2 μg/kg over
30 min at a constant rate twice daily for three weeks. Ghrelin
increased food intake and led to a non-significant increase in
body weight (49.6 ± 2.7 to 50.4 ± 2.7 kg, p = 0.09) [72].
Patients experienced a significant increase in lean body mass
as assessed by dual X-ray absorptiometry (38.3 ± 2.1 to 39.1 ±
2.1 kg, p b 0.05). Interestingly, ghrelin also led to an increase
in LVEF (27 ± 2 to 31 ± 2%, p b 0.05). Plasma levels of B-type
natriuretic peptide decreased over the three week treatment
period (238 ± 59 to 190 ± 60 pg/mL) [72]. Several studies are
currently initiated to assess whether these results can be
reproduced in double-blind placebo-controlled studies.

4.1.5. Insulin

Insulin has a pivotal role in the regulation of body com-
position for its two major functions: (i) regulation of energy
flux and substrate utilization and (ii) anabolism. In CHF,
diabetes mellitus is a common comorbidity with a prevalence
of 20–25% (compared to 5% in the general population).
Diabetes mellitus has been shown to be a predisposing factor
for the development of CHF [73,74]. Insulin resistance – the
underlying principle of type II diabetes – develops as a
continuous process and occurs decades before the diagnosis
of overt diabetes mellitus. Accordingly, sub-clinical impair-
ment of glucose metabolism has been observed in a CHF
population with a prevalence of 43% [75]. In patients with
CHF, insulin resistance is a characteristic finding increasing
in parallel to disease severity [76]. A direct impact of insulin
resistance on impaired functional capacity of skeletal muscle
has been shown [77,75]. Reduced glucose utilization is
paralleled by an increase of free fatty acid consumption which
implies reduced energetic sufficiency. Furthermore, recent
evidence suggests prognostic significance of insulin resis-
tance in CHF as it predicts impaired survival independently
of established prognosticators [78]. The underlying mechan-
isms of insulin resistance in CHF and other chronic illnesses
form a complex web of metabolic interrelations on the basis
of age and genetic predisposition, including factors such as
immune activation, neurohormonal activation, and hormonal
imbalances (e.g. hyperleptinemia, GH resistance).

On the basis of the above it seems intriguing to test
whether therapeutically targeting and restoring insulin sen-
sitivity may exert additional beneficial effects on symptom-
atic status and potentially on prognosis in CHF and especially
in cachectic patients. Thiazolidinediones are selective ago-
nists of the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-γ that
modulate insulin-mediated glucose utilization by the skeletal
muscle on a transcriptional level. The use of such insulin
sensitizers in CHF has recently been debated, because they
increase fluid retention and may contribute to increased
edema. However, animal models suggest that the weight gain
associated with the use of these substances may be blocked by
amiloride [79].

4.2. Dietary deficiency and loss of nutrients

Patients with CHF are prone to reduced appetite and
consequently reduced food intake [80]. The reasons are
multifactorial but include changes in taste and smell, dietary
advice on salt and calorie intake, social isolation, and der-
angements in bowel perfusion. However, only seldom is the
decrease in food intake per se triggering the development of
a wasting syndrome [9]. Deficiencies in both micronutrients
and macronutrients, on the other hand, may contribute to the
wasting process once triggered. Additionally, disease-
associated metabolic perturbations hamper the optimal uti-
lization of nutrients, which may have its reasons, for
example, in hormonal derangements (see below). Large-
scale studies on appetite and food intake in CHF are not
available.
In our clinical experience anorexia plays a
significant role in cachexia pathophysiology only in a
minority of patients with CHF, which contrasts findings in
COPD or malignant cancer.

4.2.1. Micronutrients

A micronutrient is any essential dietary component pre-
sent in a trace amount [81]. There is general agreement that a
diet high in sodium is potentially harmful in CHF, as it may
cause fluid overload and consequently acute decompensa-
tion. Deficiency in micronutrients, on the other hand, as a
cause of heart failure is rare, but cases due to selenium and
thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency have been reported [82].
Thiamine supplementation per se may improve cardiac func-
tion [83]. Levels of selenium have been reported to be low in
CHF. In a study of 21 patients with CHF (NYHA class II–III,
mean LVEF 29 ± 6%), baseline selenium levels were appro-
ximately 20% lower than those in healthy control subjects
(p = 0.0004) [84]. Whereas plasma levels of copper were 19%
higher in patients with CHF compared to controls (p b 0.05),
zinc levels were 9% lower (p b 0.05) [84].

Patients with CHF are usually receiving loop diuretics
which increase urinary excretion of micronutrients. Using
multiple micronutrient supplementations, Witte et al. showed
recently improvements in left ventricular ejection fraction
(LVEF) and quality of life after 9 months of treatment [85].
In this placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind study, a
total of 30 patients with CHF received capsules containing
thiamine (daily dose: 200 mg), vitamins C (500 mg) and E
(400 mg), magnesium (150 mg), selenium (50 μg), zinc
(15 mg), co-enzyme Q10 (150 mg), and various other subs-
tances. LVEF improved by 5.3 ± 1.4% in the micronutrient
group (p b 0.05 vs. placebo). A possible explanation other
than replacement of thiamine is the reduction of oxidative
stress by the aforementioned substances, a significant contri-
butor to morbidity in CHF and cardiac cachexia. Indeed,
many micronutrients can scavenge free radicals [81]. This
may ensue through direct action as with vitamins C and E
although recent studies have questioned their “real life”
efficacy in various conditions [86,87]. An indirect effect of
micronutrients may ensue as components of anti-oxidant

enzymes like zinc in superoxide dismutase or selenium in
glutathione peroxidase [88].

4.2.2. Macronutrients

Protein degradation by the proteasome plays an important
role in the development and progression of cachexia. There-
fore, amino acid supplementation has been studied in some
but still only few models. Glutamine, for example, is a non-
essential amino acid that is involved in cellular integrity and
immune function. Low plasma levels of glutamine were
found in critically ill patients and patients with chronic illness
associated with muscle wasting [89,90]. In a randomized,
placebo-controlled, double-blind study, the effect of treat-
ment with a mixture of β-hydroxy-β-methylbutyrate (3 g/
day), L-arginine (14 g/day), and L-glutamine (14 g/day) in 18
cachectic cancer patients was evaluated [91]. The placebo
group received a mixture of non-essential amino acids.
Patients in the active treatment group gained 0.95 ± 0.66 kg
compared to control subjects who lost 0.26 ± 0.78 kg after
four weeks. This change was due to a significant increase in
fat-free mass in the active treatment group (+1.12 ± 0.68 kg
vs −1.34 ± 0.78 kg, p = 0.02) [91].

Branched-chain amino acids, namely leucine, isoleucine,
and valine, have been suggested as a useful supplementation
in the treatment of cachexia [38]. These amino acids appear
to exert anabolic effects by promoting protein synthesis and
by inhibiting proteolysis. This notion appears to be parti-
cularly true for leucine [92]. Stein et al. investigated the
effect of amino acid supplementation during a 14-day period
of bed-rest, which is known to involve protein loss from
weight-bearing muscle [93]. During bed-rest, healthy volun-
teers received either a supplementation with the three bran-
ched-chain amino acids (30 mmol/day each) or a mixture of
non-essential amino acids (glycine, serine, and alanine,

Table 1
Daily dietary intake data of patients with CHF and controls

30 mmol/day each). Interestingly, the concentration of free
amino acids in muscle biopsies was greater in the branched-
chain amino acid treated group during bed-rest compared to
the control group (0.21 ± 0.07 vs 0.09 ± 0.12 nmol/mg pro-
tein, p b 0.05) [93]. Moreover, nitrogen retention, reflecting
the body's protein pool, was greater in the branched-chain
amino acid treated group (56 ± 6 vs 26 ± 12 mg nitrogen per
kg per day, p b 0.05) [93].

However, supplementation of any amino acid is certainly
not beneficial. Homocysteine,
for example, has been
described to possess negative inotropic properties [94], and
hyperhomocysteinemia is a well-established risk factor for
cardiovascular diseases. In a substudy of the Framingham
Heart Study, hyperhomocysteinemia was associated with a
hazard ratio for the development of heart failure (adjusted for
established risk factors) of 1.84 (95% CI 1.06–3.17) in men
and 1.93 (95% CI 1.19–3.13) in women [95]. In association
with relatively low levels of vitamins B6, B9 (folate), B12,
and magnesium, homocysteine levels were found to be in-
creased in patients with established CHF compared to
healthy controls (20.5 ± 2.5 vs. 13.3 ± 1.1 μmol/L, p = 0.01)
[88]. Indeed, circulating homocysteine levels are strongly
influenced by vitamin status, because homocysteine degra-
dation is dependent on the presence of vitamins B6, B9, and
B12 [96]. This point is worth stressing, as Gorelik et al. have
shown that
the intake of vitamin B9 did not reach the
recommended daily amount (400 μg) in 57 hospitalized
patients with CHF and 40 healthy controls (Table 1) [97].
Dietary supplementation with n− 3 polyunsaturated fatty
acids derived from fish oil has also been studied. In a canine
model of heart failure, the effect of fish oil supplementation
was studied [98]. 28 dogs, 15 of which were cachectic, were
fed fish oil supplement or placebo for eight weeks. Active
treatment decreased plasma levels of IL-1 (p = 0.02) and

improved cachexia (p = 0.01) compared to the placebo group.
Plasma concentrations of IGF-1 (p = 0.01) and IL-1 (p = 0.02)
correlated with survival [98].

Rozentryt et al. studied the effects of enteral support in a
small, randomized, placebo-controlled study [99]. A total of
29 patients with cardiac cachexia were randomized in a 3:1
fashion to an enteral support of 600 kcal daily in addition to
their normal diet or placebo for six weeks. After the nutri-
tional supplementation had been discontinued, patients were
followed-up for an additional 12 weeks. Interestingly, weight
increased in the active treatment group only (before
nutritional support: 63.4 ± 10 kg, after nutritional support:
66.0 ± 11 kg, p = 0.001), as did the 6-minute walking distance
(before: 366 ± 108 m, after: 433 ± 106 m, p = 0.02), and the
total fat mass (before: 15.5± 3 kg, after 17.2± 4 kg, p = 0.007).
Thus, hypercaloric diets warrant further studies in larger trials.

4.3. Malabsorption and bowel permeability

Bowel wall permeability and thus absorption of nutrients
from the gut in patients with CHF are thought to be influen-
ced mainly by two factors: bowel perfusion and bowel
edema. Indeed, the small and large intestines are highly
vascularized and receive under normal conditions up to 25%
of the cardiac output [100]. Relatively small changes in
blood flow can lead to ischemia of the tips of the villi, which
is the result of blood being shunted from arterioles to venules
at low flow rates [101]. Such phenomena are observed in
situations with low cardiac output, which may occur, for
example, after coronary artery bypass grafting [102]. Bowel
edema can lead to fat malabsorption [103] and protein loss
[104]. Especially protein loss may contribute to the deve-
lopment of cardiac cachexia. Moreover, bowel wall edema
may yield translocation of bacteria or endotoxin, a cell wall
component from Gram-negative bacteria, through the gut
wall into the circulation. Indeed, patients with edematous
decompensation of CHF were found to have elevated plasma
levels of endotoxin as compared to patients with stable
disease (0.74 ± 0.45 vs 0.37 ± 0.23 endotoxin units [EU]/mL,
p = 0.0009) and controls (0.46 ± 0.21 EU/mL, p = 0.02). The
elevated levels decreased after diuretic therapy. The endo-
toxin challenge may be the responsible stimulus that triggers
the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines [105].

4.4. Lipoprotein–endotoxin-hypothesis

It has recently been suggested that cholesterol may inhibit
the activity of endotoxin [106]. This may explain why high
cholesterol values predict better (not worse) survival
in
patients with CHF [107,108]. Indeed, it has been demon-
strated in a study in 114 patients with CHF that higher total
serum cholesterol was a predictor of improved survival
(hazard ratio 0.64, 95% CI 0.48–0.86), independent of CHF
etiology, age, LVEF, and exercise capacity [107]. This study
showed that total cholesterol ≤5.2 mmol/L (200.8 mg/dL)
was the best cut-off value as a predictor of mortality after

12 months (sensitivity 80%, specificity 62.9%) (Fig. 2). Data
from in vitro studies are in support of this view [109]. Thus,
micelle formation by cholesterol around endotoxin could be
beneficial in CHF. Indeed, earlier studies using highly puri-
fied plasma lipoproteins demonstrated that these can inhibit
endotoxin activity in a time- and dose-dependent fashion
[110]. It is not known if cholesterol values correlate with pro-
inflammatory parameters.

5. Therapeutic approaches to cardiac cachexia

5.1. Prevention of weight loss

The treatment of CHF varies according to disease seve-
rity. The standard regimen currently comprises angiotensin
converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor
blockers, β-blockers, and diuretics (thiazide or loop diu-
retics). Patients with more advanced stages of the disease
should also receive an aldosterone antagonist. Particularly
ACE inhibitors and β-blockers have recently been shown to
exert beneficial effects on weight development in patients
with CHF [19]. A re-analysis of the SOLVD database has
shown that enalapril can prevent or delay weight loss in
patients with CHF. 817 (42%) of the 1929 patients in SOLVD
experienced weight loss of 5% or more over a period of
8 months (Fig. 3). Enalapril, used at a dose of 20 mg once
daily, reduced the risk of weight loss compared to placebo
(adjusted hazard ratio 0.81, 95% CI 0.70–0.94, p = 0.0054)
[19].

Carvedilol is a β-blocker that showed a reduction in
mortality by 35% in patients with CHF compared to placebo
in the Carvedilol Prospective Randomized Cumulative
Survival Study (COPERNICUS) [111]. In a recent re-
analysis of these data it was shown that carvedilol (target
dose: 25 mg twice daily) reduced the risk of weight loss
[112]. A total of 2262 patients were analysed. 14.1% in the
placebo group and 10.2% in the carvedilol group developed
cachexia during follow-up (p = 0.005). Moreover, there was a

be advised to eat small, frequent meals [9]. Fluid overload
should be avoided, and in patients with severe symptoms or
those requiring high doses of diuretics, fluid restriction (1.5–
2.0 L per day) should be advised [80]. The evidence suggests
that multiple micronutrient supplementation is potentially
beneficial for cachectic patients [85], and it should contain
anti-oxidant supplements and B-group vitamins. As stated
above retrospective data indicate that low levels of total
cholesterol, LDL and triglycerides are associated with poor
outcome in CHF patients [116,117]. Nevertheless, statin
therapy is associated with survival benefits in CHF, and
hence statins may be beneficial in CHF patients not because
but despite their cholesterol lowering effects [118].

As a general rule, food and lifestyle factors that trigger the
acute phase response should be avoided. This comprises, for
example, excess of carbohydrates or saturated fats, alcohol,
and smoking [119]. Food that counteracts inflammatory
processes can generally be recommended, for example fish
oil supplements, olives, walnuts, flaxseed oil, any fruits or
vegetables, garlic, ginger, turmeric, sunflower seeds, eggs,
herring, or nuts [119]. Enteral nutrition should always be
preferred over parenteral feeding. If parenteral nutrition
becomes paramount, the general guidelines should be fol-
lowed: 35 kcal per kg of body weight per day, 1.2 g of
protein per kg per day, and a 70:30 glucose:lipid ratio for the
non-protein energy [9].

5.3. Pharmacotherapy of cachexia

Some therapeutic approaches are currently pursued in order
to reverse weight
loss in patients with cachexia. Cardiac
cachexia has not specifically been targeted and it appears
important to note that none of the following treatments are
currently approved for the treatment of cachexia in CHF or any
other chronic illness (with the exception for use in AIDS ca-
chexia). The therapeutic concepts comprise interventions with
appetite stimulants, anabolic steroids, and growth hormone.

Appetite stimulants such as megestrol acetate and
medroxyprogesterone acetate have been reported to stimu-
late appetite and weight gain. The optimal dose of megestrol
appears to be 800 mg daily with doses ranging from 160 to
1600 mg daily. In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-
controlled study in 107 patients with cancer, patients were
assigned to one of three treatment groups: (i) megestrol
acetate 160 mg daily (n = 37), (ii) megestrol acetate 480 mg
daily (n = 35), or (iii) placebo (n = 35) [120]. Weight gain was
reported in 38% on the lower and 68% on the higher dose of
megestrol acetate compared to 37% in the placebo group
(p b 0.03). Whilst
the higher dose of megestrol acetate
yielded a mean weight gain of 5.41 kg after 12 weeks of
treatment, there was no change in the mean values of body
weight in the lower megestrol acetate or the placebo group
[120]. In another randomized, double-blind study, a total of
475 patients with cancer were assigned to one of three
treatment arms as well: (i) dexamethasone 0.75 mg four times
daily (n = 159), (ii) megestrol acetate 800 mg once daily

decrease in mortality with increasing body mass index
(p b 0.0001), and in fact the risk of death decreased by 7.7%
per unit
increase in BMI. Importantly, only patients on
carvedilol experienced a significant increase in body weight
compared to placebo. At four months, the mean change in
body weight in the carvedilol group was +0.5 kg vs −0.1 kg
in the placebo group (p = 0.0002). At 8 months, the corres-
ponding numbers were +0.9 kg vs −0.1 kg (p b 0.0001), and
at 12 months +1.1 kg vs +0.2 kg (p b 0.0001) [112].

Although the effect of carvedilol appears to be readily
explained by the inhibition of catecholamine-induced lipo-
lysis [113], it is not entirely clear whether these effects are
class effects or apply only to specific substances. However,
bisoprolol (target dose: 10 mg once daily) reduced the risk of
weight loss in a subanalysis of the Cardiac Insufficiency
Bisoprolol Study (CIBIS) II database [114]. This subanalysis
confirmed the aforementioned findings, as it showed a
significant decrease of 3.5% in mortality with increase per
unit of body mass index. Patients with CHF with a body mass
index N 25 kg/m2 had a 25% lower risk of death than patients
with a body mass index≤ 25 kg/m2 (95% CI 8–39%).
Patients on bisoprolol experienced an increase in weight
compared to those on placebo after 12 months (+0.8 kg vs
−0.04 kg, p b 0.0001) and after 24 months (+1.2 kg vs +
0.03 kg, p = 0.0041). It appears that β-blockers exert anti-
cachexia effects by inhibiting lipolysis. A recent study found
that approximately 70% of the weight increase that a β-blocker
can induce is an increase in fat tissue mass [115].

5.2. Dietary supplementation

Patients with CHF, whether cachectic or not, should
restrict their daily sodium intake to about 2 g [80]. Foods rich
in salt such as cheese, sausages, crisps, tinned soup and
vegetables, ham, bacon, tinned meat, and tinned or smoked
fish should therefore be avoided [80]. Long periods of
fasting are potentially harmful, and cachectic patients should

(n = 158), or (iii) fluoxymesterone 10 mg twice daily (n =
158). Fluoxymesterone enhanced appetite significantly less
than the other two substances. Dexamethasone and megestrol
acetate caused a similar degree of appetite enhancement,
however, dexamethasone had a higher rate of drug discon-
tinuation compared to megestrol acetate (36% vs 25%,
p = 0.03). Treatment with megestrol acetate, on the other
hand, yielded a higher rate of deep vein thrombosis than
dexamethasone (5% vs 1%, p = 0.06). There is so far no data
on the use of megestrol acetate or systemic steroid hormones
in cardiac cachexia.

Anabolic steroids are another possible therapeutic ap-
proach to treat cardiac cachexia. Few clinical studies have
been performed in patients with cachexia, none of them in
patients with cardiac cachexia. In 12 patients with CHF due
to idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy, the administration of
the anabolic steroid oxymetholone 5–10 mg daily for three
months, led to significant decreases in left ventricular end-
diastolic (from 68 ± 2 to 63 ± 2 mm, p b 0.001) and end-
diastolic (from 53 ± 3 to 46 ± 3 mm, p b 0.001) diameters
[121]. Left ventricular mass decreased from 381 ± 37 g to
342 ± 34 g (p b 0.001). Interestingly, the reduction stopped
six months after drug discontinuation. LVEF increased from
42 ± 6% to 51 ± 5% (p b 0.005), and plasma B-type natriuretic
peptide levels decreased from 96 ± 9 to 46 ± 7 pg/mL
(p b 0.001) [121]. Body weight did not change during the
study period [121]. Pugh et al.
investigated the acute
hemodynamic effects of testosterone in 12 men with stable
CHF [122]. In this double-blind, randomized, placebo-con-
trolled cross-over
testosterone yielded a relative
increase in cardiac output 180 min after application of
testosterone (+10.6 ± 4.6%, p = 0.035 compared to baseline).
Systemic vascular resistance was reduced with maximal
effect at the same time point (−17.4 ± 9.6%, p = 0.085 com-
pared to baseline) [122]. Thus, testosterone application may
increase cardiac output via reduction of left ventricular
afterload, but it remains unclear whether this is due to its
anabolic efficacy.

trial,

A limited number of studies have addressed the use of
growth hormone in patients with CHF. Fazio et al. were
among the first to study this concept [123]. When they treated
7 patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy with re-
combinant human growth hormone 14 IU per week (4 IU
every other day) for three months, they found a significant
increase in cardiac output, particularly during exercise (from
7.4 ± 0.7 to 9.7 ± 0.9 L/min, p = 0.003). Left ventricular end-
diastolic and end-systolic dimensions decreased from 65 ± 1
to 61 ± 1 mm (p b 0.001) and from 52 ± 1 to 46 ± 1 mm
(p b 0.001). LVEF increased from 34 ± 1.5 to 47 ± 1.9%
(p b 0.001) immediately after therapy. Like the left ventricular
dimensions, LVEF decreased slightly three months after
study termination (40 ± 2.4%, p = 0.02 compared to baseline).
These promising effects, however, could only partially be
reproduced in a larger cohort of patients with idiopathic
cardiomyopathy [44]. In this study by Osterziel et al., LVEF
was essentially unchanged three months after treatment

initiation with 2 IU per day of recombinant human growth
hormone administered subcutaneously in double-blind,
randomized, placebo-controlled study in 50 patients. Left
ventricular mass increased in the active treatment arm by
25.0 ± 29.2 g (from 236 to 260 g, p b 0.001). NYHA class and
6-minute walking distance did not change during the study
period [44].

6. Conclusion

The pathophysiology of cardiac cachexia is exceedingly
complex, and only slowly do we begin to understand the
many different – and redundant – pathways involved in its
pathogenesis. Of particular importance is to establish a
commonly accepted definition of
the syndrome [124].
Targets for
future interventions include the deranged
hormonal systems involved in energy balance as well as
malabsorption from the gut and dietary supplementation
with micronutrients and macronutrients potentially joined in
some form of hypercaloric diet. Other targets involve the
inhibition of proteasome-dependent protein degradation and
the direct
inhibition of pro-inflammatory pathways. The
beneficial effects of ACE inhibitors and β-blockers in
preventing or delaying the onset of a wasting syndrome merit
further attention. Prospective randomized clinical trials are
required in that respect. These will help to improve the
patients' quality of life and possibly their survival.
