We examined the association between consumption of carotene-containing fruits and vegetables and CVD mortality among 1299 elderly Massachusetts residents who provided dietary information as a part of the Massachusetts Health Cure Panel Study. During a mean follow-up of 4.75 years, there were 161 deaths attributable to CVD, 48 of which were due to myocardial infarction. For total CVD dench and fatul myocardial infarction, risks were lower among those residents in the highest quartile for consumption of carotene-containing fnrits and vegetables as compared with those in the lowest. For death due to CVD, the relative risk (RR) was 0.54 (95% confidence incerwal (Cl), 0.34 co 0.86; P for trend across quartiles, 0.004). For myocardial infraction the RR was 0.25 (9.5% CZ, 0.09 to 0.67; P for trend, 0.002). These obserwational data are compatible with the hypothesis that increased dietary intake ofcurotenoids decreases the risks of CVD mortality; howewer, confounding CannOE be ruled out.

Data from in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that oxidative modification significantly increases the atherogenicity of low-density lipo-protein (LDL) (1). Oxidized LDL (Ox-LDL) may promote several steps in atherogenesis including endothelial cell dam- age (2,3), foam cell accumulation (4-6), and the growth (7,8) and synthesis of autoantibodies (9). By several mechanisms, Ox-LDL may initiate and propagate a cascade of reactions that results tn atherosclerosis. In addition, free radicals may ._____--From the Division of Preventive Medicine (J.M.G., J.E.M., J.E.B., C.H.H.), the Channing Laboratory (J.E.M., G.A.C., W.C.W.), and the Cardiovascular Division (J.M.G.), Deparrment of Medicine, Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston; the Department of Ambulatorv Care and Prevention, Harvard Medical School, Boston (J.E.B., C.H.H.); the Departments of Nutrition (W.C.W.) and Epidemiol-0gyfW.C.W..

Carotenoids, found in high concentrations in many green and yellow fresh fruits and vegetabies, are lipid- soluble antioxidants (18). Moreaver beta-carotene is con- centrated in atherosclerotic plaque (19). in a large prospec-tive cohort of elderly Massachusetts residents, we were able to examine the relationship of dietary Intake of fruits and vegetables high in carotenoids with subsequent mortality from CVD. SUBJECTS AND METHODS In 1976, as part of the Massachusetts Health Care Panel Study, dietary information was obtained by personal inter-view from 1273 out of 1299 residents 66 years or older who were not living in nursing homes and who had previously been identified from a statewide area ;Irobability sample Publwhed 19% bv Elsev~er Science Inc. ri;i Aven~~e (;i ttc .4mericas, New York, NY 10010 within Massachusetts (20). Follow-up of these participants was conducted with annual mailings and an additional in-terview in late 1980. After an average of4.75 years, mortality follow-up was available for 96% of the cohort. When dietary data were collected, the cohort had a median age of 72 years and 62% were women. The age and sex distributions of the cohort are consistent with Massachusetts census data. Procedures followed were in accord with institutional hu-man research committee standards. Dietary information was obtained for each of 43 catego- ries on a food frequency questionnaire. Subjects were asked to indicate usual consumption over the past year for each item on the questionnaire. Consumption was measured as the number of servings using the following scale: more than once a day, daily, not every day but more than once a week, once a week, less than once a week, and never. Six food categories that are high in carotene content were identified: carrots and squash; tomatoes; salads and green leafy vegeta- bles such as spinach and greens; dried fruits such as apricots, prunes, and raisins; fresh strawberries andkesh melon; and broccoli and brussels sprouts. We derived a daily carotene intake score that corresponded to the number of servings per day of each food category, ranging from 1 for daily to l/7 for weekly, to I/14 for less than weekly, to 0 for never (21). This method gave an equal weight to each item that constituted the carotene score; because the foods that had been grouped together on the original questionnaire were not homogeneous with respect to carotene content, it was not possible to derive a more refined score. Further analyses were conducted for each of the six carotene-containing food categories individually, comparing those whose intake was greater with those consuming less than one serving per day. During 4.75 years of follow-up, there were 317 reported deaths among the cohort. Deaths were confirmed by search- ing the Massachusetts vital statistics register for the years 1976 through 1980 and obtaining death certificates. Cause of death was coded by trained nosologists according to the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) and without knowledge of information on the questionnaire. Cause or date of death could not be confirmed for 47 subjects. (Seven people were reported to have died out of state, and 18 re- ported deaths in Massachusetts could not be confirmed by death certificate; 22 deaths were excluded because cause or date of death was unknown.) Of 270 confirmed deaths, 161 were attributed to CVD, and availability of complete dietary information permitted estimation of carotene scores for 151. The cohort was divided into quartiles according to our carotene score (0 to < 0.8, 0.8 to < 1.4, 1.4 to < 2.05, and 2 2.05 servings/d of foods high in carotenoid content). The relative risk (RR) was calculated as the number of deaths divided by the person-years of observation in each quartile of carotene score compared to the corresponding rate in the lowest quartile, after adjustment for age (5-year catego-AEP Vol. 5, No. 4 July 1995: 255-260 ries) and sex. In addition, RRs were calculated after further adjustment for all available coronary risk factors; these in- cluded smoking status (never, past, current, pipe/cigar only), cholesterol intake, alcohol use (never, < one drink/d, 2 one drink/d), and functional status (activities of daily living (ADL) score) (22). To facilitate data collection in this elderly population, the food frequency questionnaire for this study was abbreviated (several foods were combined into a single questionnaire item). Thus, data were not ade-quate to accurately estimate total or saturated fat or total caloric intake. Proportional hazards multivariate analyses and test for linear trend were conducted using Statistical Analysis Systems (23). RESULTS Baseline characteristics for each quartile of carotene score are presented in Table 1. There was a nonsignificant trend toward younger age across quartiles. After adjustment for age, there was a greater proportion of women among those with higher carotene score, and alcohol and cholesterol consumption tended to increase across quartiles. There were no other significant baseline differences. Of 161 CVD deaths, 48 were attributed to myocardial infarction and the remaining 113 were classified as due to other cardiovascular causes. The age- and sex-adjusted RRs of cardiovascular death were significantly lower in each of the two highest quartiles when compared to the lowest (Ta-ble 2). Specifically, for the fourth quartile the RR was 0.54 (95% CI = 0.34 to 0.86), and for the third quartile the RR was 0.59 (95% CI = 0.38 to 0.92) as compared with the lowest quartile. The test for trend showed a significant in-verse relationship of carotene intake with death from CVD (P for trend = 0.004). These results were not materially altered after controlling for smoking, cholesterol intake, alcohol consumption, and functional status (Table 3). Simi- lar trends were apparent for death due to myocardial in-farction, with a significant reduction in RR in each of the two highest quartiles of consumption. As shown in Table 2, in the fourth quartile the age- and sex-adjusted RR was 0.25 (95% CI = 0.09 to 0.67), and in the third quartile the RR was 0.44 (95% CI = 0.20 to 0.98). There was a significant inverse trend across quartiles (P for trend = 0.002). These results were not materially altered by adjustment for all available coronary risk factors in multivariate analysis (see Table 3). Since early symptoms of disease may influence dietary intake, the analyses were repeated after subjects who died in the first year of follow-up were excluded, and the findings were similiar. Stratification by sex revealed risk reductions among both men and women. Further analyses were conducted for each food category.

There were significant reductions in risk for those who ate one or more servings per day of carrots and squash as well as for those eating one or more servings per day of salads and green leafy vegetables, with age- and sex-adjusted RRs of death from CVD or 0.40 (95% CI = 0.16 to 0.98) and 0.49 (95% CI = 0.31 to 0.77), respectively. An apparent (though not statistically signifi-cant) reduction in risk was also associated with consumption of broccoli and brussels sprouts. These three food categories are among the highest in beta-carotene content. In contrast, for dried fruits there was no apparent risk reduction. Al-though this category contains dried apricots, which are high in carotene content, other dried fruits such as raisins and prunes, which are low in carotene content, are more likely to contribute to food consumption in this food category. DISCUSSION This prospective cohort study among elderly Massachusetts residents indicates an inverse relationship between reported consumption of fruits and vegetables rich in carotenoids and subsequent death from CVD in general, and from myo- cardial infarction in particular. The association persisted after controlling for age, sex, smoking, alcohol use, choles- terol intake, and functional status. The food items associ- ated with the greatest reduction in CVD death were among the highest in carotene content. Quartile 2 3 (n = 246) (n = 258) (n =.256) 0.8 to < 1.4 1.4 to < 2.05 3 2.05 65.0 hS. 1 67.2 30.1 32.2 28.9 ,-4.9 i.: 3.9 39.4 35.3 33.6 47.6 51.8 48.9 28.0 25.7 30.9 19.5 Ii.1 X6.8 4.9 5.4 4.1 41.9 13.7 41.5 48.8 16.7 17.4 266 (9i) 278 (97) 0.17 (0.70) 0.11 (0.51) Several potential strengths and limitations of the present study should be considered. First, the prospective design of this study renders bias in reporting dietary intake less likely; data on exposure were collected before the end points oc-curred. Miscoding errors on death certificates could be a potential bias; however, ICD coding was carried out by trained nosologists without knowledge of beta-carotene sta- tus, and random misclassification would result in an undet- estimation of the true association.

It is unlikely that unknown cause of death was in any way related to dietary exposure; thus differential follow-up is unlikely to have introduced a sub- stantial bias. As in any observational study, observed associations may be due in part to confounding. It is possible that the observed reduction in risk associated with intake of fruits and vegetables rich in carotenoids may be due not to their carotene content but rather to other micronutrients or, alternatively, to other dietary or life-style variables. The analyses using the individual food categories suggest, how-ever, that intake of foods highest in carotene was associated with the greatest benefit. The limited dietary questionnaire was not adequate to estimate total energy intake, which has been inversely associated with CVD. Although replace-ment of dietary fat or cholesterol with fruits or vegetables may result in an apparent reduction of cardiovascular risk, control for cholesterol intake did not materially alter the results. It is also possible that other cardiovascular risk fac- tors (e.g., physical activity, diabetes, and hypertension, on which data were not available) may confound these results. However, such unmeasured variables would have to be in- versely correlated with carotene score; that is, those who would have been at higher risk would have had to decrease the intake of the six items listed in Table 4. While control for available risk factors did not materially alter results, residual confounding remains a possibility. Our findings are consistent with those from other epide-miologic research on fruit and vegetable consumption. Ver-langieri and coauthors (24) hypothesized that cardiovascu-lar mortality is declining in the United States, in part because of greater year-round availability offruit and vegeta- bles, and two British descriptive studies (25, 26) demon- strated that consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables was inversely associated with the risk of CVD. ASP Vol. 5, No. 4 July 1995: 255-260 TABLE 4.

After 8 years of follow-up among 87,245 female participants in the Nurses’ Health Study, there were 552 coronary heart disease events (437 myocar- dial infarctions and 115 coronary deaths). An apparent 22% reduction in the risk of coronary heart disease events was observed among women in the highest quintile of beta-carotene intake as compared with the lowest, and there was a significant trend across quintiles of beta-carotene con-sumption (P for trend = 0.02), after adjustment for age, smoking, and other cardiovascular risk factors (19). A simi- lar inverse association was observed for ischemic stroke (RR = 0.61; 95% CI = 0.39 to 0.98; P for trend = 0.01). Consumption of alpha-tocopherol was also inversely associ-ated with risks of coronary heart disease. Similar findings were reported in the Health Profession-als Follow-up Study, a cohort of 39,000 men who had no history of vascular disease (20). After 4 years of follow-up, there were 667 major coronary events (360 coronary revas-cularization procedures, 209 nonfatal myocardial infrac-tions, and 106 fatal myocardial infarctions). When men in the highest quintile of intake of beta-carotene were com-pared with men in the lowest, the RR was 0.75 (95% CI = 0.57 to 0.99; P for trend = 0.04). As in the Nurses’ Health Study, alpha-tocopherol consumption was inversely associ-ated with risks of coronary heart disease in the Health Pro-fessionals Follow-up Study. A growing number of blood-and tissue-based studies support an inverse relationship between plasma antioxidant vitamins and CVD. Plasma beta-carotene levels were lower among patients who had angina pectoris as compared with healthy control subjects, but the association was attenuated after controlling for smoking (27, 28). In a recent study, levels of beta-carotene in adipose tissue were significantly lower among patients who had had myocardial infarction than among control subjects, but there was no association with alpha-tocopherol(29). Three prospective studies mea- sured plasma antioxidant levels at baseline for the entire cohort and reported inverse associations between plasma carotenoids and subsequent atherosclerotic disease events (30-33). Results of nested case-control studies, in which frozen blood samples were analyzed years after collection, are less consistent, with one reporting an inverse association for baseline bata-carotene levels (34) and two such studies reporting no association for vitamin A levels and subse- quent coronary heart disease (35, 36); however, vitamin A level may not accurately reflect beta-carotene status. Although the data from both prospective studies of di- etary intake and analyses of blood components are compati- ble with a possible benefit from carotenoids as well as from other antioxidants (e.g., alpha-tocopherol), when small-to- moderate effects are sought, the amount of uncontrolled confounding inherent observational studies may be as large as the likely reduction in risk. For this reason reliable data on the relationship between carotenoid consumption and CVD can only emerge from large-scale randomized trials of adequate dose and duration, in which investigators allocate subjects at random to either active treatment or placebo. Randomized trial data on beta-carotene supplementa-tion are sparse. A subgroup of 333 US male physicians who were participating in the Physicians’ Health Study, and who did not have prior myocardial infarction, stroke, or tran- sient ischemic attacks but who did have chronic stable an- gina or a revascularization procedure were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of beta- carotene in the prevention of CVD and cancer (37). Al- though the number of individual events was small after 5 years of treatment, those assigned to receive beta-carotene had a significant reduction in a combined end point of subsequent major vascular events (nonfatal stroke, nonfatal myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization, or cardio- vascular death) as compared with those assigned to receive the placebo (RR = 0.46; 95% CI = 0.24 to 0.85). A recent large-scale randomized trial of vitamins in the prevention of cancer among a poorly nourished population in Linxian, China, reported a significant reduction in over- all mortality among those assigned combined treatment with beta-carotene (15 mg daily), alpha-tocopherol (30 mg daily), and selenium (50 i.tg daily). The observed reduction in mortality was largely due to a reduction in stomach cancer mortality (38). While mortality from ischemic heart disease accounted for less than 9% of the total deaths, cerebrovascu- lar mortality comprised 26% of the total, and there was an apparent, though nonsignificant, reduction in the risk of CVD mortality (RR = 0.90; 95% CI = 0.76 to 1.07). In this population most strokes are likely to be hemorrhagic rather than thromboembolic. While the latter are generally due to atherosclerotic disease, this is not the case for the former. Therefore, the relevance ofthese findings in terms of atherosclerotic disease prevention is not clear. In addition, it Gaziano et al. 259 CAROTENOIDS AND CARJXOVASClJLAR M0RTALITL is not possible to determine the individual effects of each agent since they were given in combination. The Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Preven- tion trial (ATBC trial) is the first large-scale randomized trial of antioxidant vitamins in a well-nourished population. This 2 x 2 factorial trial tested the effect of beta-carotene (20 mg daily) and alpha-tocopherol (50 mg daily) in the prevention of lung cancer among 29,13 3 Finnish male smok- ers (39). After adjustment for testing multiple hypotheses, there were no increases or decreases in risk that could not be explained plausibly by change. Nevertheless, some findings were unexpected. For beta-carotene, there were, in fact, more ischemic heart disease deaths in the treated group (653 versus 586). For alpha-tocopherol, there was no clear reduction in risk of ischemic heart disease (602 among those assigned alpha-tocopherol versus 637 among those assigned placebo). However, the apparent benefits among those who took vitamin E in the Nurses’ Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study were largely confined to those who used a dose of 100 IU or more per day for 2 or more years, which is higher than the 50 mg used in the ATBC trial. In addition, the use of synthetic vitamin E at a rela- tively low dose resulted in only a modest increase in plasma levels. In conclusion, these data suggest that among the elderly, reported intake of fruits and vegetables high in sarotenoids is inversely associated with the risk of subsequent CVD mortality. These findings are consistent with previously re-ported basic research and observational epidemiologic data and are compatible with the hypothesis that antioxidants may retard the progression of atherosclerosis. Kecent ran-domized trial data on the role of bera-carotene, as well as other antoxidants, in the prevention of CVD are conflict- ing. Additional large-scale randomized trials of adequate sample size will be necessary to confirm or refute the possible role ofbeta-carotene, as well as other antioxidants, in reduc- ing the risk of CVD in men and women. 0ngoing large-scale randomized trials include the Physicians’ Health Study, the Women’s Health Study, the CARET (CARorene/RETi-noic acid) study, the SU.VI.M.AX (Supplementation of Vitamin and Mineral Antioxidants) Study, the Heart Pro- tection Study, and the Women’s Antioxidant Cardiovascu-lar Disease Study (a secondary prevention trial.). This work is supported by grants from the US ,Admin~stration on Aging (no. 90-A-641) and the National Heart, Lung, :WK Blr~~d Institute (HL, 26490, HL-34595, HI--4385 1). REFERENCES 1.
