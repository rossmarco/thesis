ABSTRACT
Background: Higher intakes of fish and nҀ3 fatty acids are asso-
ciated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular events and mortality.
However, limited data exist on the effect of fish intake on actual
measures of progression of coronary artery atherosclerosis.
Objective: The aim was to examine the association between fish
intake and the progression of coronary artery atherosclerosis in
women with coronary artery disease.
Design: This was a prospective cohort study of postmenopausal
women (n ҃ 229) participating in the Estrogen Replacement and
Atherosclerosis trial. Usual fish intake was estimated at baseline
with a food-frequency questionnaire. Quantitative coronary angiog-
raphy was performed at baseline and after 3.2 앐 0.6 (x៮ 앐 SD) y to
evaluate changes in the mean minimum coronary artery diameter,
the mean percentage of stenosis, and the development of new coro-
nary lesions.
Results: Compared with lower fish intakes, consumption of 욷2
servings of fish or 욷1 serving of tuna or dark fish per week was
associated with smaller increases in the percentage of stenosis
(4.54 앐 1.37% compared with Ҁ0.06 앐 1.59% and 5.12 앐 1.48%
compared with 0.35 앐 1.47%, respectively; P 쏝 0.05 for both) in
diabetic women after adjustments for age, cardiovascular disease risk
factors, and dietary intakes of fatty acids, cholesterol, fiber, and alcohol.
These associations were not significant in nondiabetic women. Higher
fish consumption was also associated with smaller decreases in mini-
mum coronary artery diameter and fewer new lesions.
Conclusions: Consumption of fish is associated with a significantly
reduced progression of coronary artery atherosclerosis in women with
coronary artery disease.

INTRODUCTION

The consumption of fish and the long-chain nҀ3 fatty acids
eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)
is associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular events and
mortality (1– 6). Some of the favorable associations between
nҀ3 fatty acid intake and low rates of cardiovascular disease
mortality may be related to a decreased risk of sudden death (2,
4, 7, 8). However, several lines of evidence suggest that nҀ3 fatty
acid intake may also have favorable effects on the pathogenesis
or progression of atherosclerosis (9 –12). Direct evidence linking
fish intake to the rate of progression of coronary disease is limited

and, to date, is not available in women (13–15). On the basis of
observational data, Hu et al (16) recently reported that a high fish
intake is associated with a reduced risk of coronary artery disease
(CAD) and total mortality in diabetic women. It is unclear
whether there is a direct relation between fish intake and the
progression of coronary atherosclerosis. The aim of this study
was to examine the relation between fish consumption and the
progression of angiographically defined coronary atherosclero-
sis in a group of postmenopausal women undergoing baseline
and 3-y follow-up coronary angiography as part of a randomized
clinical trial of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) (17).

SUBJECTS AND METHODS

Subjects

The Estrogen Replacement and Atherosclerosis trial was a
randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of HRT. The
study design and primary results were reported previously (17),
and the results on fat intake and atherosclerosis progression were
reported separately (18). Briefly, postmenopausal women with
coronary stenoses of 욷30% of the luminal diameter were ran-
domly assigned into 3 groups and received 1) 0.625 mg conju-
gated equine estrogen (n ҃ 100), 2) 0.625 mg conjugated equine

estrogen plus 2.5 mg medroxyprogesterone acetate (n ҃ 104), or
3) placebo (n ҃ 105). At baseline, the subjects completed ques-
tionnaires about their health status, medical history, dietary in-
take, and cardiovascular disease risk factors and underwent clin-
ical examination and quantitative coronary angiography. The
subjects were classified as having diabetes if their fasting glucose
concentration was 욷7.0 mmol/L or their 2-h glucose was 욷11.1
mmol/L during an oral-glucose-tolerance test, their glycated he-
moglobin value was 쏜7% (19), or they reported having diabetes
or the use of diet, oral hypoglycemics, or insulin as treatment for
diabetes. The mean (앐SD) period between angiographic mea-
surements was 3.2 앐 0.6 y. The study protocol was approved by
the Institutional Review Board at the participating sites (17) and
at the New England Medical Center, and Tufts University, Bos-
ton. All subjects gave their informed written consent before par-
ticipating in the study.

Dietary assessment

Usual dietary intake during the year before the baseline mea-
surements was assessed with a validated, semiquantitative, 126-
item food-frequency questionnaire as described previously (20).
Dietary information was judged as unreliable and excluded from
further analysis if reported energy intakes were 쏝660 or 쏜3500
kcal/d or 쏜11 food item was left blank (n ҃ 8); 282 reliable
food-frequency questionnaires were completed. Frequency of
fish consumption was calculated by summing the frequency of
intake of tuna (84 –112 g/serving) dark fish (84 –140 g/serving),
or other fish (84 –140 g/serving). Because tuna and dark fish are
the major dietary contributors to the long-chain nҀ3 fatty acid
intake, their intake was calculated by summing these 2 intakes
alone.

Laboratory measurements

Serum lipids were analyzed by using standardized enzymatic
methods (17). Glucose and glycated hemoglobin were measured
as previously described (17, 21). C-reactive protein (CRP) was
measured at baseline with the use of a high-sensitivity kit (Amer-
ican Laboratory Products Co, Windham, NH) (22). Interleukin 6
(IL-6) and vascular and intercellular adhesion molecules
(VCAM-1 and ICAM-1, respectively) were similarly measured
by using standardized enzyme-linked immunoassay techniques.

Outcome measurements

Quantitative coronary angiography was performed by using
standardized techniques at baseline and at the end of follow-up in
248 women (x៮: 9.3 segments per women) (17). Review and anal-
ysis of the paired films were performed by using a previously
validated system of cine projectors (SME-3500; Sony, Park
Ridge, NJ) and software (QCAPlus; Sanders Data Systems, Palo
Alto, CA). The reference, minimum, and average luminal diam-
eters and the degree of stenosis (as a percentage of the reference
diameter) were assessed in proximal epicardial segments. All
measurements were performed by operators unaware of the
women’s dietary habits or the temporal sequence of the films.
Development of a new lesion was defined as the presence of one
or more segments with 쏝15% stenosis at baseline and an increase
of 욷15 percentage points at follow-up.

Statistical analysis

All statistical analyses were performed by using SAS (version
8; SAS Institute, Cary, NC). The normality of continuous vari-
ables was checked, and log transformations were applied as
needed. Differences in baseline characteristics and nutrient in-
takes were tested between the different intake categories by using
independent-samples t test, Wilcoxon’s rank-sum test, or chi-
square test, as appropriate. The association between total fish
intake and different types of fish intake was tested by using the
test parameters of changes in mean minimum coronary artery
diameter and mean percentage stenosis with the use of mixed-
model analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). The model allows for
differential variation in disease progression across different cor-
onary segments and correlation in segment changes within a
given participant. These measurements were adjusted for age, the
location of the coronary segment, the time of follow-up, study
clinic, coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), percutaneous
transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA), race, body mass in-
dex (BMI; in kg/m2), smoking, use of cholesterol-lowering med-
ication, HRT, diabetes, and energy intake (model 1). Model 2
included adjustments for the factors in model 1 and energy-
adjusted intakes of saturated fat, monounsaturated fat, polyun-
saturated fat, cholesterol, fiber, and alcohol. Further adjustments
for blood pressure; serum concentrations of total cholesterol,
HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, triacylglycerol, and inflam-
matory markers; education, and strenuous physical activity were
also made. Differences in the development of new lesions were
tested with ANCOVA [general linear models (GLM)], with ad-
justment for study clinic, time of follow-up, CABG, PTCA, use
of cholesterol-lowering medication, HRT, diabetes, energy in-
take, and energy-adjusted intakes of saturated fat, monounsatu-
rated fat, polyunsaturated fat, cholesterol, fiber, and alcohol. The
interaction between fish intake and diabetes status was tested
with ANCOVA, and if the P value for the interaction term was
쏝0.10, ANCOVA (without adjustment for diabetes) was per-
formed according to diabetes status. Spearman correlation coef-
ficients adjusted for BMI were calculated between inflammatory
markers and fish intake. A value of P 쏝 0.05 (two-tailed) was
considered statistically significant.

RESULTS

Most of the baseline characteristics, including concentrations
of serum lipids and inflammatory markers and blood pressure did
not differ significantly between women who reported 쏝2 or 욷2
servings of fish per week (Table 1). Women who ate 욷2 servings
of fish per week had a higher educational level and were engaged
more frequently with strenuous physical activity. Women who
consumed 욷2 servings of fish per week reported higher intakes
of energy, protein, cholesterol, alcohol, and carotene and lower
intakes of carbohydrates (Table 2).

As previously reported, neither estrogen alone nor estrogen
plus medroxyprogesterone acetate compared with placebo af-
fected the progression of atherosclerosis in this population (17);
however, the HRT was controlled in the multivariate models that
assessed progression. Because of a prior report suggesting a
selectively beneficial effect of fish intake in diabetic women on
CAD events (16), we analyzed our data on the basis of diabetes.
Forty-two percent of the women participating in this study were
classified as having diabetes (Table 1). Change in minimum

coronary artery diameter was significantly smaller in women
who consumed 욷2 servings of fish per week than in those who
consumed 쏝2 fish servings per week (P for fish intake ҃ 0.02)
(Table 3). Adjustment for age, location of coronary artery seg-
ment, time of follow-up, study clinic, CABG, PTCA, race, BMI,
smoking, use of cholesterol-lowering medication, HRT, diabe-
tes, and energy intake (model 1) diminished the relation (P ҃
0.06). Further adjustment for dietary variables known to affect
CAD risk, saturated fat, monounsaturated fat, polyunsaturated
fat, cholesterol, fiber, and alcohol (model 2) strengthened the
association between fish intake and change in minimum coro-
nary artery diameter (P ҃ 0.006).

Among diabetic women, baseline mean percentage stenosis
was greater in those who consumed 욷2 servings of fish per week
(Table 3). Compared with the lower fish intake, the change in
percentage stenosis was smaller in women who consumed 욷2
servings of fish per week (P 쏝 0.001). This association was
restricted to diabetic women after adjustments in models 1 and 2.
Subsequent adjustments of model 2 for blood pressure; serum
concentrations of total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, LDL cho-
lesterol, triacylglycerol, and inflammatory markers; education;

or strenuous physical activity did not appreciably alter the rela-
tions between fish intake and changes in minimum coronary
artery diameter and percentage stenosis (data not shown).

Women who consumed 욷2 servings of fish per week had
significantly fewer new lesions (P ҃ 0.02, ANCOVA after ad-
justment for the specified factors) (Table 3). Seventeen (21%) of
the women consuming 욷2 servings of fish per week and 51
(34%) of the women consuming 쏝2 servings of fish per week
developed at least one new lesion (chi-square test, P ҃ 0.03).

Tuna and dark fish are the major contributors of long-chain
nҀ3 fatty acids in the American diet. The average content of EPA
and DHA in tuna (0.3–1.3 g/serving) and dark fish (0.7–1.8
g/serving) is at least twice that of fish in the “other fish” category
(0.1– 0.4 g/serving) (23). Therefore, it was of interest to deter-
mine whether the type of fish influenced atherosclerosis progres-
sion. Women who reported consuming 욷1 serving of tuna or
dark fish per week had a smaller change in minimum coronary
artery diameter (P ҃ 0.02) (Table 4). This association was
diminished and limited to diabetic women when adjusted for the
factors in model 1. The association became significant when

women who consumed 욷1 serving of “other fish” than in those
who reported lower intakes (Table 4). In nondiabetic women,
those reporting 욷1 serving of “other fish” per week had smaller
changes in minimum coronary artery diameter and percentage
stenosis. The associations between angiographic changes and
consumption of other fish were significant when factors in model
2 were adjusted (P ҃ 0.04 and P ҃ 0.05, respectively); however,
the interaction between diabetes status and intake of other fish
was not significant. There were also fewer segments with new
lesions in women who consumed 욷1 serving of “other fish” per
week.

To determine whether the associations of fish intake were
related to markers of inflammation, we evaluated correlations
between fish intake and concentrations of inflammatory markers
after adjustment for BMI, because CRP concentrations have
been suggested to be directly associated with BMI (24). Fish
intake was inversely correlated with concentrations of
VCAM-1 in all women (Table 5). Concentrations of CRP,

IL-6, and ICAM-1 were not significantly correlated with fish
consumption.

DISCUSSION

Fish and nҀ3 fatty acid intakes have received considerable
attention in the recent past as potential dietary factors to reduce

FISH INTAKE AND ATHEROSCLEROSIS

the risk of developing CAD (4 – 6, 25). This growing body of data
culminated with a 2002 recommendation by the American Heart
Association for persons without documented CAD to eat fish
twice or more per week and for patients with documented CAD
to consume 1 g EPA ѿ DHA/d (26). The importance of these and
other recommendations for diabetic persons was highlighted
when the National Cholesterol Education Program (27) desig-
nated diabetes as a CAD risk equivalent. This may be particularly
important in women, in whom the adverse effects of diabetes may
be greater than those in men (28).

There are no previous data on fish intake and atherosclerosis
progression in women. The present results extend prior obser-
vational data on CAD risk by showing that fish intake is associ-
ated with reduced progression of atherosclerosis in postmeno-
pausal women with established CAD within the 3-y
observational period of the study. Subsequent analysis indicated
that this association was strongest in the subgroup of women with
diabetes. The interaction terms between fish intake and diabetes
were not significant in all of the analyses. The possibility that this
observation was due to limited statistical power cannot be ruled
out. Nevertheless, within the 3-y period, new lesions were ob-
served in all women regardless of fish intake. Data from the
current study are consistent with recent observational data, sug-
gesting an association with fish and nҀ3 fatty acid intakes and a
decreased incidence of CAD and total mortality in diabetic
women (16). These data can be interpreted in 2 ways. The ob-
servation of a significant association of fish intake in diabetic, but
not in nondiabetic women, may be due to a higher degree of
sensitivity of diabetic women to nҀ3 fatty acids. However, the
possibility cannot be excluded that the observation may reflect a
more rapid rate of atherosclerosis progression in the diabetic
women, hence, a greater likelihood that a positive association
would be observed within the observational period.

The lower rate of angiographically documented atherosclero-
sis progression was significantly associated with tuna and dark
fish intake, whereas these associations appeared to be weaker for
the intake of “other fish.” This finding is likely a reflection of the
higher nҀ3 fatty acid content of tuna and dark fish than of “other
fish.” Alternatively, it may be related to the method used for
preparation of tuna and dark fish relative to that for white fish.
The later type of fish is more likely to be fried in fat that is high
in either trans or saturated fatty acids (25). The findings of the
current study are consistent with those of previous studies, which
documented an inverse association between dark fish intake and
total mortality and CAD morbidity in diabetic women partici-
pating in the Nurses’ Health Study (16). Furthermore, intake of
tuna or other broiled or baked fish has been shown to be associated
with a reduced risk of cardiac death in female and male subjects
participating in the Cardiovascular Health Study (25). Similarly,
intake of fatty fish was associated with a lower risk of cardiac death
in men participating in the Seven Countries Study (29).

Although fish intake and fish-oil supplements have been as-
sociated with a reduced risk of clinical events, the effect of fish
or nҀ3 fatty acid intake on the progression of atherosclerosis has
been controversial. Bairati et al (30) reported that dietary nҀ3
fatty acid intake was associated with a lower frequency of reste-
nosis at 6 mo after PTCA in men, whereas Watts et al (31)
reported no association between atherosclerosis progression and
dietary intakes of EPA and DHA in men after 3 y of follow-up.
Less progression of atherosclerosis has been reported after 1 y of
treatment with fish-oil supplements in CABG patients (14) and

CAD patients after 2 y of treatment (15). In contrast, Sacks et al
(13) reported that fish-oil supplementation did not alter the pro-
gression of atherosclerosis in CAD patients over a 28-mo period.
Self-reported intake of fish at least twice a week has been shown
to be associated with a lower prevalence of myocardial lesions in
men at autopsy (32). Fish-oil supplementation has been reported
to have little effect on restenosis after PTCA (33–35). However,
restenosis is a pathophysiologically distinct process compared
with progression of native atherosclerosis. There are no data
focusing on fish intake and atherosclerosis progression in women
or in diabetic subjects. In most cases, the data sets include 앒80%
male subjects (13–15, 34), and data are not reported separately
for female subjects.

Fish and nҀ3 fatty acids are suggested to have antiinflamma-
tory properties (12) that may contribute to the reduced risk of
CAD, especially in diabetic subjects (36). Concentrations of
most inflammatory markers, with the exception of VCAM-1,
were not associated with fish intake in this study. VCAM-1,
which is mainly expressed on atherosclerotic plaques, is sug-
gested to predict CAD risk, especially in subjects with advanced
atherosclerosis (36). These data may have been confounded by
the relatively high BMI or proportion of diabetic women in the
study population. These data are consistent with previous work
suggesting that fish-oil supplementation does not affect concen-
trations of CRP and IL-6 (37) or ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 (38).

Our study had certain limitations. Higher fish intakes were
associated with a healthier lifestyle. Although these factors were
controlled for during the analysis, residual confounding cannot
be ruled out. The results suggest that intake of tuna and dark fish
is more strongly associated with a reduction in progression than
is the intake of other types of fish. Because the latter category of
fish is more likely to not only be fried but also to be consumed
with other fried foods (eg, fried potatoes), such a dietary pattern
could have contributed to the observed outcome (25). There have
been some concerns that fish contaminated with mercury could
diminish the benefits of fish (39). We were not able to evaluate
the effect of mercury because there was no data collected on
mercury exposure.

In conclusion, fish consumption was associated with a signif-
icantly reduced progression of coronary atherosclerosis in post-
menopausal women with CAD. This relation was strongest in
diabetic women. The findings support the view that regular fish
consumption is a part of a healthy diet.
