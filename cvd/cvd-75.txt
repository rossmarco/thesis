Results

The objective of this study was to assess the relation between the level of habitual potassium intake and the
incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD).

Prospective cohort studies have evaluated the relationship between habitual potassium intake and incidence of
vascular disease, but their results have not been not entirely consistent.

We performed a systematic search for prospective studies published, without language restrictions (1966 to Decem-
ber 2009). Criteria for inclusion were prospective adult population study, assessment of baseline potassium intake,
assessment of vascular events as outcome, and follow-up of at least 4 years. For each study, relative risks (RRs) and
95% conﬁdence intervals (CIs) were extracted and pooled using a random-effect model, weighted for the inverse of
the variance. Heterogeneity, publication bias, subgroup, and meta-regression analyses were performed.

Eleven studies were identiﬁed, providing 15 cohort samples that included 247,510 male and female partici-
pants (follow-up 5 to 19 years), 7,066 strokes, 3,058 coronary heart disease (CHD) events, and 2,497 total CVD
events. Potassium intake was assessed by 24-h dietary recall (n ⫽ 2), food frequency questionnaire (n ⫽ 6), or
24-h urinary excretion (n ⫽ 3). In the pooled analysis, a 1.64-g (42 mmol) per day higher potassium intake was
associated with a 21% lower risk of stroke (RR: 0.79; 95% CI: 0.68 to 0.90; p ⫽ 0.0007), with a trend toward
lower risk of CHD and total CVD that attained statistical signiﬁcance after the exclusion of a single cohort, based
on sensitivity analysis (RR: 0.93; 95% CI: 0.87 to 0.99; p ⫽ 0.03 and RR: 0.74; 95% CI: 0.60 to 0.91; p ⫽ 0.0037).

Conclusions

Higher dietary potassium intake is associated with lower rates of stroke and might also reduce the risk of CHD
and total CVD. These results support recommendations for higher consumption of potassium-rich foods to pre-
vent vascular diseases.

The relationship between dietary potassium intake and
blood pressure (BP) has been known for a long time (1).
Many cross-sectional and longitudinal prospective studies
have detected an inverse relationship between dietary po-
tassium intake and BP (2,3). In the largest available meta-
analysis of the randomized controlled trials of potassium

supplementation, an increase in potassium intake of at least
20 mmol (0.78 g) per day was associated with signiﬁcant
average reductions of 4.9 mm Hg systolic BP and 2.7 mm
Hg diastolic BP in hypertensive patients (4), although no
signiﬁcant effect was apparent in one large trial (5). The
effect of potassium on BP was more pronounced in those
having an elevated sodium intake and in black compared
with white individuals. In a more recent meta-analysis (6),
which included only 5 studies featuring a prolonged
follow-up (at least 8 weeks), a favorable impact was also
detected; however, the difference was not statistically sig-
niﬁcant after the exclusion of a single outlier study reporting
an exceptionally large favorable effect (7).

In a different long-term randomized controlled trial that
assessed the effects of increased potassium intake attained by
natural foods, patients assigned to the potassium-rich diet
achieved and maintained BP control at the end of a 1-year
follow-up with less than half the amount of drugs needed by
the control group (8).

Potassium Intake and Cardiovascular Risk

1211

Because hypertension is the main cause of cardiovascular
morbidity and mortality (9), it is reasonable to expect that
higher potassium intake could favorably affect cardiovascular
morbidity and mortality rates. Indeed, a high potassium
intake dramatically reduces the elevated death rate associ-
ated with a high-salt diet in stroke-prone spontaneously
hypertensive rats (10) and the extent of renal damage in Dahl
salt-sensitive rats (11).

Randomized controlled trials of the effects of long-term
increases in dietary potassium intake on morbidity and
mortality from cardiovascular disease (CVD) are lacking,
and indeed such a trial could hardly be carried out because
of technical difﬁculties and ethical problems. Nevertheless,
several prospective cohort studies over 3 decades have
explored the possible association between habitual dietary
potassium intake and incidence of vascular events. The
results of these studies are not entirely consistent possibly
because of, in some cases, insufﬁcient statistical power.

The technique of meta-analysis allows the evaluation of
the combined results of different studies, thus enhancing the
overall statistical power, increasing precision of the esti-
mates of effectiveness, evaluating consistency among studies,
and exploring possible publication bias. Therefore, we
performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess
whether or not the overall evidence obtained in prospective
studies supports the presence of a relationship between
habitual levels of dietary potassium intake and stroke and
cardiovascular outcomes and to obtain an estimate of the
risk.

Methods

Data sources and searches. We performed a systematic
search for publications using Medline (1966 to December
2009), Embase (from 1988), Allied and Complementary
Database (from 1985), Cumulative Index to Nursing and
Allied Health Literature (from 1982), Psychinfo (from
1985), and the Cochrane Library. The search strategy used
the expressions potassium intake AND stroke, cerebrovas-
cular disease, cardiovascular disease, coronary heart disease,
cerebrovascular accident, cerebrovascular disorders, cardio-
vascular accident, cardiovascular disorders, cerebral infarc-
tion, cerebral hemorrhage or combinations thereof, either in
medical subject headings or in the title/abstract, with no
language restrictions. Further information was retrieved
through a manual search of references from recent reviews
and relevant published original studies (12).
Study selection. Two reviewers (L.D. and G.B.) indepen-
dently extracted the data. Discrepancies about inclusion of
studies and interpretation of data were resolved by arbitra-
tion (P.S. or F.P.C.), and consensus was reached after
discussion. In the case of missing data for potentially
suitable studies, the authors were contacted and asked to
provide the necessary information. To be included in the
meta-analysis, a published study had to meet the following
criteria: 1) original article; 2) prospective design; 3) adult

ease (CHD) determined prospec-
tively as outcome; 6) indication of
the number of participants ex-
posed and the rate or number of
events in different categories of
potassium intake; 7) assessment
of relative risk (RR) or hazard ratio (HR) for different
potassium intake categories, and 8) follow-up of at least 4
years (mean or median).

Of a total of 3,271 publications retrieved (Fig. 1), 12
studies were identiﬁed that met the inclusion criteria.
Because 2 studies referred to the same cohort (NHANES I
[National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey I]
[13,14]), we included the one that used more stringent
inclusion criteria (14), excluding patients with positive
history of CVD at baseline. Therefore, 11 studies were used
for the meta-analysis, providing suitable data on 15 cohorts
overall (Table 1) (14–24).
Data extraction. The following characteristics of the iden-
tiﬁed studies and respective populations were recorded:
publication reference, total number of participants, country,
sex, age (mean, median, or range), follow-up (years), out-
come reported (fatal or nonfatal stroke, CHD, or CVD),

outcome assessment method, number (rate) of events, po-
tassium intake assessment method, and level of potassium
intake in different categories. Categorization of potassium
intake differed among studies: some of them reported the
number of patients exposed and the rate (number) of events
occurring across categories of potassium intake and some
others reporting differences in the event rate for a given
difference in potassium intake (15,16,20,24). Whereas in
the latter case, the RR or HR reported by the authors was
used for the analysis, for the studies that stratiﬁed partici-
pants by categories of potassium intake, the RR for the highest
versus lowest intake was calculated by comparing the event rate
in the 2 extreme categories (Table 2).
Statistical analysis. The quality of the studies included in
the meta-analysis was evaluated by the Downs and Black
score system. The adapted quality score system contained 4
sections: reporting, external validity, internal validity—bias,
and internal validity—confounding. A higher score was
considered to be an indicator of better quality, on a scale of
19 (25).

Relative risks or HRs were extracted from the selected
publications, and their SEs were calculated from the respec-
tive conﬁdence intervals (CIs). The value from each study
and the corresponding SE were transformed into their
natural logarithms to stabilize the variances and to normal-
ize their distribution. The pooled RR (and 95% CI) was
estimated using a random-effect or ﬁxed-effect model,
weighted for the inverse of the variance (26). The pooled
estimate from the random-effects model was used if the test
for heterogeneity was signiﬁcant. The heterogeneity among
studies was tested by Q statistic and quantiﬁed by H statistic
and I2 statistic (27). Funnel plot asymmetry was used to
detect publication bias, and the Egger regression test was
applied to measure funnel plot asymmetry. In the case of
signiﬁcant funnel plot asymmetry, suggesting a number of
possibly “missing” publications, the pooled RR estimate was
recalculated based on the estimated number of “missing”
studies and their effect sizes and SEs, a method known as
“trim and ﬁll” (28,29).

The inﬂuence of individual cohorts, from which the
meta-analysis estimates were derived, was examined by
omitting one cohort at a time to see the extent to which
inferences depend on a particular study or group of studies
(sensitivity analysis).

Subgroup and meta-regression analyses were used to
identify associations between risk of stroke, CHD, or CVD
and relevant study characteristics (sex of participants, coun-
try of origin, duration of follow-up, method of potassium
intake assessment, difference in potassium level, and quality
score and control for baseline BP and body mass index
[BMI]) as possible sources of heterogeneity.

All statistical analyses were performed using MIX soft-
ware version 1.7 (30) and Stata version 9.1 (Stata Corp.,
College Station, Texas) for meta-regression analysis (31).

Results

Characteristics of the study cohorts. The relevant features
of the 11 studies included in the meta-analysis are reported
in Table 1. Overall, the meta-analysis involved 247,510
participants from 6 countries (6 studies from the United
States and 1 each from Finland, Japan, the Netherlands,
Scotland, and Taiwan). Eight studies recruited both male
and female participants, whereas 2 studies recruited only
men and 1 recruited only women. Six studies reported only
stroke events (fatal or nonfatal), 1 only CVD outcomes, 1
only fatal and nonfatal CHD, and 3 reported combined
outcomes. Potassium intake was assessed by food frequency
questionnaire in 6 studies, 24-h urine excretion in 3 studies,
and 24-h dietary recall in 2 studies. Average potassium
intakes ranged between 45 and 85 mmol/day in all but 1
population, for which a very large average intake of 125
mmol/day was reported (22). The overall number of inci-
dent strokes was 7,066 and that of CHD events 3,058. The
number of events reported simply as CVD events was 2,497.
Of the 8 studies including both male and female partici-
pants, 3 reported outcomes separately for men and women
(15,16,23). The study by Green et al. (19) also included 2
different cohorts, based on the use of diuretics.

Thus, overall there were 11 cohorts available for the rela-
tionship between potassium intake and stroke, 6 cohorts
available for the relationship with CHD, and 4 cohorts for the
relationship between potassium intake and CVD. The
weighted average follow-up time was 12.2 years (range 5 to 19
years).
Potassium intake and stroke risk. Detailed ﬁgures on
population size, incident strokes (when possible, total stroke
incidence was used), and baseline levels of potassium intake
of the 11 cohorts included in the meta-analysis are given in
Table 2 (overall, 233,606 participants and 7,066 events)
(14,15,17–23), and the results of the pooled analysis are
shown in Figure 2. In the pooled analysis, higher potassium
intake (average weighted difference: 1.64 g or 42.1 mmol/
day) was signiﬁcantly associated with lower risk of stroke
(RR: 0.79; 95% CI: 0.68 to 0.90; z ⫽ 3.38; p ⫽ 0.0007).
There was signiﬁcant heterogeneity among studies (Q ⫽
22.0; p ⫽ 0.01; I2 ⫽ 55%), and there was no evidence of
publication bias by the Egger test (p ⫽ 0.11). As shown in
Figure 2 for the individual cohorts included in the analysis,
a trend toward an inverse association between potassium
intake and stroke risk was detected in 9 cohorts and was
statistically signiﬁcant
them. A nonsigniﬁcant
opposite trend was observed in only 2 cohorts (both small,
and one involving diuretic therapy). Sensitivity analysis
showed that the risk of stroke did not vary substantially with
the exclusion of any individual study.

In addition, we carried out an analysis including the
results of the NHANES I cohort as reported by Fang et al.

incident CHD, and baseline levels of potassium intake of the
6 cohorts included in the analysis are given in Table 2 (overall
81,612 participants and 3,058 events) (14,16,20,23). In the
pooled analysis, there was a trend toward an inverse association
between higher potassium intake (average weighted difference:
1.38 g or 35.3 mmol/day) and risk of CHD (RR: 0.92; 95%
CI: 0.81 to 1.04; z ⫽ 1.35), which was not statistically
signiﬁcant (p ⫽ 0.18) (Fig. 3). There was moderate nonstatis-
tically signiﬁcant heterogeneity among studies (Q ⫽ 9.1; p ⫽
0.10; I2 ⫽ 45%). There was no evidence of publication bias
by the Egger test (p ⫽ 0.51), but the “trim and ﬁll” method
identiﬁed 1 possibly missing study, modifying the pooled
estimate to an RR of 0.94, with 95% CI of 0.81 to 1.10. The
evaluation of individual studies showed a trend toward an
inverse association between potassium intake and CHD risk
in 4 cohorts, with signiﬁcantly lower risk in 2, whereas a
nonsigniﬁcant opposite trend was observed in 2 small
cohorts. Sensitivity analysis showed that the exclusion of a
single study (23) led to a pooled estimate of RR of 0.93
(95% CI: 0.87 to 0.99), which was statistically signiﬁcant
(p ⫽ 0.03).
Potassium intake and CVD risk. Detailed ﬁgures on
population size,
incident CVD, and baseline levels of
potassium intake of the 4 cohorts included in this analysis

are given in Table 2 (overall 62,453 participants and 2,497
events) (20,23,24). In the pooled analysis, there was a trend
toward an inverse relationship between higher potassium
intake (average weighted difference: 1.30 g or 33.4 mmol/
day) and CVD risk (RR: 0.85; 95% CI: 0.62 to 1.16; z ⫽
1.01), which was not statistically signiﬁcant (p ⫽ 0.31)
(Fig. 4). There was signiﬁcant heterogeneity among studies
(Q ⫽ 10.3; p ⫽ 0.02; I2 ⫽ 71%) and no evidence of
publication bias (Egger test; p ⫽ 0.40). The evaluation of
individual studies showed a trend toward an inverse associ-
ation between potassium intake and CVD risk in 3 cohorts,
with signiﬁcantly lower relative risk in one of them. A
nonsigniﬁcant opposite trend was observed in 1 small cohort.
Sensitivity analysis showed that the exclusion of a single study
(20) led to a pooled estimate of RR of 0.74 (95% CI: 0.60 to
0.91; p ⫽ 0.0037). After exclusion of this cohort, there was no
study heterogeneity (Q ⫽ 1.51; p ⫽ 0.47; I2 ⫽ 0%).
Source of heterogeneity. Further analyses were carried
out to check for potential sources of heterogeneity that
may have affected the association between dietary potas-
sium and vascular outcomes. Subgroup analysis was used
for categoric variables and meta-regression for continu-
ous variables.

SUBGROUP ANALYSIS. We explored the inﬂuence of sex,
method of potassium intake assessment, and population

META-REGRESSION ANALYSIS: CHD. The results of meta-

not signiﬁcant sources of heterogeneity in the relationship
of the potassium intake effect on the risk of CHD.

sis (Table 4) showed that the length of follow-up (coefﬁ-

Discussion

The present meta-analysis assessed the effects of dietary
potassium on cardiovascular end points in a sample of nearly
250,000 individuals, pooled from 11 published studies, the

largest studied so far. The results indicated that an average
increase of 1.64 g (42 mmol) of potassium per day is
associated with a 21% reduced risk of stroke, suggesting an
important protective role. This ﬁnding was strengthened by
the detection of a signiﬁcant protective effect in as many as
4 of the 11 individual cohorts included in the analysis and by
the observation that a (not signiﬁcant) opposite trend was
reported in only 2 small cohorts. The protective effect of
potassium against the risk of stroke may conceivably relate
to its BP-lowering effect, particularly in hypertensive indi-
viduals and in those with elevated sodium intake. Never-
theless, because all of the studies included in the analysis
reported an estimate of risk adjusted for baseline BP or
hypertension status—and our subgroup analysis showed the
independence of the effects of potassium from baseline BP
and other confounders—it appears that at least part of the
effect of potassium might be based on different mechanisms.

pertensive rats (32,33), to inhibit vascular smooth muscle
cell proliferation in vitro (34), and to reduce aortic wall
thickening in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats
by increasing the release of growth-inhibiting agents (35).
More recently, a high-potassium diet was shown to exert a
protective effect against the development of vascular damage
induced by salt loading, at least in part through suppression
of the production of reactive oxygen species (36). This large
body of evidence from experimental studies provides further
biologic plausibility to the possible protective effect of
dietary potassium against cardiovascular events.

Our study also showed a trend toward RR reduction for
CHD and CVD in the pooled analysis for individuals
consuming a higher-potassium diet: for both outcomes, this
trend was not statistically signiﬁcant. In both cases, how-
ever, statistical signiﬁcance was achieved upon exclusion of
a single cohort on the basis of sensitivity analysis, with
reductions of 7% in the risk of CHD and 26% in the risk of
total CVD being associated with differences in potassium
intake of 1.4 and 1.3 g per day, respectively. Our ﬁndings
add to the results of a recent intervention study using a
potassium-enriched salt that detected a long-term positive
effect of increased potassium intake on cardiovascular mor-
tality in elderly men in northern Taiwan (37).

Potassium is particularly abundant in fruits and vegeta-
bles. A greater fruit and vegetable consumption has already
been shown to protect against the occurrence of stroke.
According to the meta-analysis by He et al. (38), 5 or more
servings of fruit and vegetables per day are associated with a
26% lower rate of stroke compared with 3 or fewer servings.
In that study, the association was similar for ischemic and
hemorrhagic stroke. Thus, the present meta-analysis points
to potassium as one of the factors responsible for the
beneﬁcial effect of high vegetable and fruit consumption, at
least for ischemic stroke.
Study limitations. Our analysis showed a signiﬁcant het-
erogeneity among the studies in terms of sample size,
duration of observation, number of events, and difference in
dietary potassium intake between the groups being com-
pared. This heterogeneity led to a reduced statistical power
in detecting a possible association between dietary potas-
sium and CHD and CVD. For this reason, although
statistical evidence in favor of an effect of higher potassium
intake on risk of CHD and total cardiovascular events was
actually obtained after the exclusion of outliers based on
sensitivity analysis, we acknowledge that the evidence in
favor of the protective effect of potassium against CHD and
CVD is less robust and not conclusively proven.

A further limitation was given by the inaccurate estimates
of habitual potassium intake that was available for all studies
only at baseline. In addition, none of the methods available
for the evaluation of potassium intake provided 100%
accurate estimates, the best one being 24-h urine collection,
which was adopted in only 3 studies. Inaccurate estimates of
habitual potassium intake introduce a regression dilution
bias, which is expected to reduce the probability to detect

true biologic associations, and thus may have led to under-
estimating the reduction in the risk of stroke and other
vascular events associated with a higher-potassium diet.

Also, the lack of potential confounders in the analyses
presented in the single study reports is a limitation of our
study. For instance, only 4 studies reported an estimate of
risk adjusted for sodium intake (14,20,23,24), the most
relevant confounding factor of the potassium effect.

Finally, although subgroup and meta-regression analysis
failed to identify duration of exposure, sex, baseline BP or
hypertensive status, or BMI or obesity status as factors
contributing to heterogeneity of the study results, the
number of studies included in the analysis, particularly for
the CHD and CVD outcomes, may have been too small to
allow a conclusive evaluation of the effect of these different
factors.
Implications. According to a recently published meta-
analysis of the relationship of sodium intake to the risk of
stroke (39), a 5 g or 85mmol/day lower dietary sodium
intake is associated with a reduction in the risk of stroke of
23%. This value is similar to the risk reduction (21%)
observed in the present analysis for a 1.64 g or 42 mmol/day
higher potassium intake. This risk reduction would be
translated into a reduction of as many as 1,155,000 stroke
deaths per year on a worldwide scale and is expected to
produce overall health beneﬁts by reducing the impact of
disability to an extent similar to that obtained by dietary salt
reduction. The Seventh Report of the Joint National Com-
mittee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treat-
ment of High Blood Pressure guidelines recommended an
intake of 100 mmol or more potassium per day (40). In all
of the populations that were the object of the present
meta-analysis, the average potassium intake was far lower
than this. Potassium intake may be increased by well-
described dietary changes, mainly an increase in fruit and
vegetable consumption, as recommended by all guidelines
for CVD prevention and treatment, as well as by national
guidelines for healthy nutrition in the general population.

Conclusions

Increasing dietary potassium intake is expected to exert a
protective effect against stroke and might also reduce the
incidence of CHD and total CVD. These results apply to
the general population, not only to speciﬁc subgroups at
higher risk. The favorable effects of dietary potassium were
documented at least to some extent independently of other
factors. Efforts should therefore be made to favor the
synergy with other nutritional- or lifestyle-related preven-
tive measures.
