and not single nutrients should be studied, since food items might have a synergistic
and antagonistic effect on health. The Mediterranean diet has long been associated
with lower incidence of cardiovascular disease and cancer. Therefore, we devel-
oped a diet score that incorporates the inherent characteristics of this dietary
pattern.
Methods and results: We used 11 main components of the Mediterranean diet (non-
reﬁned cereals, fruits, vegetables, potatoes, legumes, olive oil, ﬁsh, red meat,
poultry, full fat dairy products and alcohol). For the consumption of items pre-
sumed to be close to this pattern we assigned scores 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 when a par-
ticipant reported no consumption, rare, frequent, very frequent, weekly and daily,
respectively. For the consumption of foods presumed to be away from this pattern
we assigned the scores on a reverse scale. Especially for alcohol, we assigned score
5 for consumption of less than 300 ml/day, score 0 for consumption of more than
700 ml/day or none and scores 1e4 for consumption of 300e400, 400e500, 500e
600, and 600e700 ml/day (100 ml ¼ 12 g ethanol), respectively. Then a total score
ranging from 0 to 55 was calculated. After having applied this diet score in the par-
ticipants of the ATTICA study we observed a signiﬁcant positive association with
monounsaturated fat and monounsaturated-to-saturated fat intake. We also ob-
served, an inverse association with serum lipids, blood pressures, inﬂammation
and coagulation markers related to cardiovascular disease. The application of that
score in a caseecontrol study (CARDIO2000) suggested that the score was inversely
associated with the odds of having acute coronary syndromes.

Introduction

Methods

The effect of a diet on human health has already
been underlined in many studies. During the past
years population-based surveys and large-scale clin-
ical trials have provided scientiﬁc evidence that
diets, and especially those rich in fruits, vegetables,
legumes, whole grains, ﬁsh and low-fat dairy prod-
ucts, are associated with lower incidence of various
chronic diseases, including cardiovascular disease
and cancer [1e5]. The National Cholesterol Educa-
tion Program and the American Heart Association
recently considered that a dietary therapy or med-
ical nutrition therapy was the primary approach to
preventing and treating hyperlipidemia and hyper-
tension [1].

At this point it should be mentioned that the
majority of studies concerning the nutritional ﬁeld
followed the approach of assessing single nutrients
or food items, instead of assessing dietary patterns.
However, people do not eat isolated nutrients, but
they consume meals consisting of a variety of foods
with complex combinations of nutrients. Several
investigators have suggested a holistic dietary
approach on disease prevention [6,7]. Dietary pat-
terns capture the extremes of dietary habits, pre-
empts nutritional confounding, possible effect
modiﬁcation among nutritional variables through
the same procedure and they do not tend to be
biased. As a result the use of dietary patterns seems
to be more attractive than the use of single food or
nutrients.
In addition, Martinez-Gonzalez and
Estruch [8] underlined the need of randomized trials
using a whole-diet approach and not a simple
antioxidant supplement in order to evaluate the
role of the Mediterranean dietary pattern on human
health. Moreover,

level of protection. Thus,

in a recent

In this context, this paper proposes a diet score
that assesses adherence to the Mediterranean diet
and evaluates its predictive ability on cardiovas-
cular disease risk and markers.

Before we describe the development of the diet
score it is important to present, in brief, the
Mediterranean dietary pattern, based on which
the diet score was developed.

The Mediterranean dietary pattern

The diet of the people living in Mediterranean
basin, where olive oil is the principal source of
dietary fat, encompasses all the beneﬁcial dietary
characteristics presented in previous studies. Many
investigators have already underlined the beneﬁ-
cial role of this dietary pattern on all-cause and
coronary heart disease mortality [10e14], on lipid
metabolism, on blood pressure levels [6,9,13,14],
on body mass index [15] and on inﬂammation and
coagulation process [16]. Olive oil is important to
human health not only because it has several ben-
eﬁcial properties, but because it also promotes the
consumption of large quantities of vegetables in
the form of salads and equally large quantities of
legumes in the form of cooked foods. Other essen-
tial components of the Mediterranean diet are
wheat, olives and grapes and their various deriva-
tive products. Total lipid intake in this dietary pat-
tern may be high (around or in excess of 40% of
total energy intake)
in Greece, or moderate
(around 30% of total energy intake) in Italy. In all
instances, however, the ratio of monounsaturated-
to-saturated fats is about or more than 2, which is
much higher than in other places of the world,
including northern Europe and North America.

The Mediterranean dietary pattern has become
customary to be represented in the form of
a pyramid (triangle), the base of which refers to
foods which are suggested to be consumed most
frequently and the top of the pyramid to those
foods to be consumed rarely. The remaining foods
occupy intermediate positions (Fig. 1 [17]). In par-
ticular, this dietary pattern consists of: (a) daily
consumption of non-reﬁned cereals and products
(like whole grain bread, pasta, rice, etc., 8 serv-
ings/day), vegetables (2e3 servings/day), fruits
(4e6 servings/day), olive oil (in daily cooking as
the main added lipid) and nonfat or low-fat dairy
products (like cheese, yoghurt, and milk, 1e2 serv-
ings/day), (b) weekly consumption of potatoes

(4e5 servings/week), ﬁsh (4e5 servings/week),
olives, pulses and nuts (>4 servings/week) and
more rare poultry (1e3 servings/week), eggs and
sweets (1e3 servings/week) and monthly con-
sumption of red meat and meat products (4e5
servings/month). This pattern is also characterized
by moderate consumption of wine (1e2 wine-
glasses/day), which usually accompanies meals.
In addition, although intake of milk is moderate,
the consumption of cheese and yogurt is relatively
high. Feta cheese is regularly added to salads and
accompanies vegetable stews.

The Mediterranean diet score

Following the rationale of
the Mediterranean
dietary pattern [17], we decided to include the
consumption of the following food groups in the
diet score: non-reﬁned cereals (whole bread, pasta,
rice, other grain, biscuits, etc.), fruit, vegetables,

full

legumes, potatoes, ﬁsh, meat and meat products,
poultry,
fat dairy products (like cheese,
yoghurt, and milk), as well as olive oil and alcohol
intake. Food items in a particular group contained
similar levels of macronutrients and other key
nutrients. Then, based on the suggested intake
(see Fig. 1) we used monotonic functions (with
the exception of alcohol intake) in order to score
the frequency consumption of these foods. In par-
ticular, we assigned individual ratings (from 0 to 5
or the reverse) in each of the 11 food groups
according to their position in the Mediterranean
diet pyramid. For the consumption of items pre-
sumed to be close to this pattern (i.e. those sug-
gested on a daily basis or more than 4 servings/
week; non-reﬁned cereals, fruits, vegetables, le-
gumes, olive oil, ﬁsh, and potatoes) we assigned
score 0 when someone reported no consumption,
score 1 when they reported consumption of 1e4
servings/month, score 2 for 5e8 servings/month,

without any clinical evidence of cardiovascular or
other atherosclerotic disease, chronic viral infec-
tions, cold or the ﬂu, acute respiratory infection,
dental problems or any type of surgery, during
the past weeks. Participants completed a semi-
quantitative food frequency questionnaire [19]
that was administrated by trained dieticians. The
questionnaire assessed usual dietary intake over
the preceding year and included 156 foods and
beverages commonly consumed in Greece, with 7
non-overlapping response categories. Illustrations
assisted the responders to deﬁne the portion sizes
in several foods which were included in the ques-
tionnaire. The frequency of consumption was
quantiﬁed approximately in terms of the number
of times this food was consumed per month.
Thus, daily consumption was multiplied by 30 and
weekly consumption was multiplied by 4 and a val-
ue of 0 was assigned to food items rarely or never
consumed. Consumption of various alcoholic bev-
erages was measured in ml (100 ml is considered
to have 12 g of ethanol). According to the Methods
described above we calculated the Mediterranean
diet score of the participants.

Additionally, based on food composition tables
[20] we calculated daily energy intake (in kcal), to-
tal, monounsaturated, saturated, polyunsaturated
lipids (in g/day), the percentage of energy from
saturated lipids and the ratio of monounsaturated-
to-saturated lipids.

Statistical analysis

Descriptive parameters, like mean, standard de-
viation, coefﬁcient of variation, tertiles and range,
were used to describe the distribution of the diet

score 3 for 9e12 servings/month, score 4 for 13e
18 servings/month and score 5 for more than 18
servings/month. Potatoes, although they are not
on the basis of
the Mediterranean pyramid,
were included in this group of foods since they
are a good source of vitamins C, B1, and B2, nia-
cin, carbohydrates, ﬁber, potassium and magne-
sium, which
associated with
cardiovascular disease risk markers in previous
studies. On the other hand, for the consumption
of foods presumed to be away from this diet
(i.e. rare or monthly consumption; meat and
meat products, poultry and full fat dairy prod-
ucts) we assigned the scores on a reverse scale
(i.e. 5 when someone reported no consumption
to 0 when they reported almost daily consump-
tion). Especially for alcohol we did not use
a monotonic function, but we assigned score 5
for consumption of less than 300 ml of alcohol/
day,
score 0 for consumption of more than
700 ml/day and scores 4e1 for consumption of
300, 400e500, 600 and 700 or 0 ml/day (100 ml
has 12 g ethanol concentration),
respectively.
Thus, the score ranges from 0 to 55. Higher values
of this diet score indicate greater adherence to
the Mediterranean diet (Table 1).

Application of the diet score to
epidemiological data

We next calculated the diet score of 1514 men and
1528 women (>18 years old) randomly selected
(according to sex and age distribution of the
reference population) from the Athens greater
area (78% urban and 22% rural regions) in Greece
(the ATTICA Study [18]). All participants were

score. Kurtosis of the diet score distribution was
2 ÿ 3, where m4
evaluated through the formula m4/m2
is the fourth central moment of the distribution
and m2 is the variance. Skewness was measured
3/2. Other continuous variables
by the formula m3/m2
are presented as mean  standard deviation. Asso-
ciations between categorical variables were tested
by the calculation of Chi-squared test, while dif-
ferences between categorical and several bio-
chemical, clinical and nutritional variables were
tested by the use of Student’s t-test and Manne
Whitney test (for the normally distributed and
the skewed variables, respectively). Comparisons
between continuous variables and tertiles of the
diet score were performed using one-way analysis
of variance, after adjusting for age and sex. The
assumption of normality was tested through the
ShapiroeWilk test. Homogeneity of the variances
across tertiles of the diet score was tested through
Levene’s test. Due to multiple comparisons we
used the Bonferroni correction in order to account
for the inﬂation in Type I error.

The diet score was calculated through 2 nutri-
tional evaluations using the same sample. Differ-
ences in the distribution of the diet score between
the 2 evaluations were assessed through the
Wilcoxon test for paired comparisons.

Linear regression models using the diet score as
an independent variable, age and sex as covariates
and blood pressure, total cholesterol, inﬂammation,
coagulation and oxidative stress markers and the
nutrient intake as an outcome (response) were
applied to evaluate the proposed score. The results
derived from the regression models are presented as
b-coefﬁcients and standard error of the coefﬁcient.
Normality of the standardised residuals was assessed
using the ShapiroeWilk test. The assumptions of lin-
earity for the continuous independent variables and
of the variance of the standardised residuals being
constant were assessed through plotting the resid-
uals against the ﬁtted values. Serial dependency on
the response variables was tested through Durbine
Watson criterion. Co-linearity between independent
variables was evaluated through the calculation of
the variance inﬂation factor (VIF). Model’s good-
ness-of-ﬁt was graphically evaluated (standardised
residuals versus ﬁtted values).

We additionally tested the Mediterranean diet
score on a hard outcome, i.e. incidence of coro-
nary heart disease. In particular, we used the data
from a caseecontrol study (CARDIO2000 [21]) with
848 enrolled patients who had been hospitalised
for a ﬁrst symptom of coronary heart disease (sta-
ble angina was excluded from the analysis)
and 1078 cardiovascular disease-free controls,
matched to the patients by age, sex and the region

they came from. Estimations of the relative risks of
developing acute coronary syndromes, based on
the diet score and other characteristics of the par-
ticipants, were performed by the calculation of
odds ratio (OR) through multiple conditional logis-
tic regression analysis. Deviance residuals were
used to evaluate the model’s goodness-of-ﬁt.
Finally, cut-off point analysis was used to deter-
mine the optimal value of the diet score that
differentiates patients from controls. In particular,
the crucial point was deﬁned by the largest
distance from the diagonal line of the receiver
operating characteristic curve (ROC) (sensitivity 
{1 ÿ speciﬁcity}) [22].

All reported P values were based on two-sided
tests and compared to a signiﬁcance level of 5%.
SPSS 11.0.5 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) software
was used for all the statistical calculations.

Results

Table 2 presents various descriptive characteristics
of the Mediterranean diet score as derived from its
evaluation of the participants of the ATTICA study.
As we can see the expected value of the diet score
is about 25 for men and 27 for women. The fre-
quency distribution of the score looks symmetri-
cal, strongly leptokurtic (Fig. 2) and not normal
(P ¼ 0.001). Moreover, the coefﬁcient of variation
is 11.5% in men and 11.8% in women, indicating
a small spread of the values. However, there are
some extreme values, since the range is 45 and
48 in men and women, respectively.

Furthermore, during the year after the initial
examination the participants of the study were

asked again about their dietary habits (participation
rate ¼ 87%). Data analysis showed that the partici-
pants reported similar dietary habits between the
2 nutritional evaluations (P ¼ 0.24).

Consistency of the diet score with the
characteristics of the Mediterranean diet

Thereafter we tested the score against various
food groups and nutrients intake. Table 3 illus-
trates the weekly frequency consumption of the
food groups and alcoholic beverages that are
used to develop the diet score, by tertile of the
score. As expected from the design of the score,
increased consumption of fruits, vegetables, pota-
toes, non-reﬁned cereals, ﬁsh, legumes and olive
oil was observed in the highest tertile of the diet
score, while higher consumption of red meat, poul-
try and full fat dairy products was observed in the
lowest tertile of the score. Moreover, an inverse
association was observed between tertiles of the
Mediterranean diet score and energy intake. In ad-
dition, the percentage of full fat in the highest ter-
tile of the score was around 40%, while the ratio of
monounsaturated-to-saturated fat was greater
than 2.

Evaluation of the diet score on various
health outcomes

We then evaluated the predictive ability of the
proposed diet score on health outcomes and
factors that affect cardiovascular risk. One of our
aims was to ﬁnd whether the score has similar
associations between Mediterranean diet and spe-
ciﬁc outcomes as they had been evidenced in
previous studies. In particular, we evaluated the
effect of the Mediterranean diet on systolic blood

pressure (average of 3 consecutive measurements
with the participants in sitting position for at least
30 min), on C reactive protein, ﬁbrinogen, on total
antioxidant capacity, on total serum cholesterol
levels and on body mass index (body weight in kg
divided by height squared in m) (details about
the other measurements have already been pre-
sented [19]). Table 4 illustrates the results from
the multiple linear regression models, after con-
trolling for age, sex, energy intake, cigarette
smoking habits (>1 cigarette/day), physical activ-
ity (>1 times/week) and years of school. Signiﬁ-
cant associations between the Mediterranean
diet score and the outcome were observed in all
models. No co-linearity between the diet score
and other variables was observed (VIF < 2); the
graphs (not presented here) of standardised resid-
uals against ﬁtted values did not indicate any dis-
crepancy from homoscedasticity, and no serial
dependencies in the data series were observed
(DurbineWatson test < 2). In addition, less than
1% extreme values (outliers) were found in each
model.
Furthermore, the diet score was inversely asso-
ciated with daily energy intake (b-coefﬁcient 
standard error per 20/55 unit change in the score:
ÿ76.8  35 kcal, P ¼ 0.03), after adjusting for age,
sex, body mass index and physical activity status.
On the other hand, diet score was positively associ-
ated with monounsaturated-to-saturated fat ratio
(b-coefﬁcient  standard error per 20/55 unit change
in the score: 0.16  0.03, P ¼ 0.02), after adjusting
for the aforementioned potential confounders.

We also tested the diet score against a hard
outcome (i.e. presence of acute coronary syn-
dromes). The diet score and the odds of having
coronary heart disease were related in an inverse
way. More speciﬁcally, an 11/55-unit increase in

the diet score was associated with a 37% (odds
ratio ¼ 0.63, 95% CI 0.54e0.73) decrease in the
odds of having acute coronary events. In order to
test the hypothesis that the association between
adherence to the Mediterranean diet score and
coronary risk is independent of the conventional
cardiovascular risk factors, we controlled for sev-
eral potential confounders. Thus, after adjusting
for the matching factors (i.e. age and sex), smok-
ing habits, presence of diabetes (special treatment
or fasting blood glucose > 125 mg/dl), hyperten-
sion (special treatment or systolic/diastolic blood
pressures > 140/90 mm Hg), hypercholesterolemia

index >
29.9 kg/m2), physical activity, years of school and
annual income earned during the past 3 years,
the decrease in the odds of having acute coronary
syndromes was 27% (odds ratio ¼ 0.73, 95% CI
0.66e0.89) per 11/55-unit increase in the diet
score. Furthermore, participants in the highest
tertile of the score had 46% lower odds (odds ra-
tio ¼ 0.54, 95% CI 0.44e0.66) of having acute coro-
nary syndromes as compared to the participants in
the lower tertile. The model had good predictive
performance (65%) and no more than 2% of outliers
was observed. Table 5 presents the results of the
logistic regression analysis which evaluated the
odds of having acute coronary syndromes by diet
score class. As we can verify a consistent inverse
relationship between diet score and odds of having
coronary heart disease was observed.

We developed a simple dietary score based on the
inherent characteristics of the Mediterranean diet.
Moreover, we evaluated the relationship of this
diet score with various markers related to cardio-
vascular disease risk, as well as the likelihood of
developing acute coronary syndromes. The score
was inversely associated with systolic blood pres-
sure, C reactive protein, ﬁbrinogen [16], total se-
rum cholesterol, body mass index and oxidized
LDL concentrations [23], as well as with acute cor-
onary syndromes risk and positively associated
with total antioxidant capacity.

During the past years dietary pattern analysis
has emerged as an alternative and complementary
approach to examining the relationship between
diet and the risk of various chronic diseases,
including cardiovascular disease. Instead of look-
ing at individual nutrients or foods, pattern anal-
ysis examines the effects of overall diet, and
represents a broader picture of food and nutrient
consumption. Thus, it has been suggested that
dietary patterns are more predictive of disease risk
than individual foods or nutrients. Several studies
have suggested that dietary patterns derived from
factor or cluster analysis predict disease risk or
mortality [24,25]. During the past decades several
observational studies have suggested that people

with high intakes of fruits, vegetables and olive oil,
which are rich in vitamins C and E, b-carotene, se-
lenium, a-tocopherol and ﬂavonoids, experience
lower risk of chronic diseases. The Mediterranean
diet encompasses these dietary characteristics
and has long been associated with lower incidence
of cancer and coronary heart disease since the ear-
ly 1970s [10]. In addition, there is growing interest
in using dietary quality indices to evaluate whether
adherence to a certain dietary pattern, like the
Mediterranean diet, or current dietary guidelines
lowers the risk of various diseases. For example,
De Lorgeril et al. [12] observed a signiﬁcantly low-
er rate of cardiovascular complications in patients
who had had a myocardial infarction and followed
the Mediterranean diet as compared to those who
followed the American Heart Association Step I
diet. Under
these concepts we developed
a large-scale diet score (0e55) that assesses the
inherent characteristics of
the Mediterranean
diet. The distribution of this score was leptokurtic
and with expected values around 26 out of 55, in-
dicating that the majority of the population in
which the score was applied reported a moderate
adherence to this dietary pattern. We have also
evaluated the proposed diet score on the occur-
rence of acute coronary events. In particular, we
have classiﬁed this score into tertiles, where the
upper tertile could be described as greater adher-
ence to the Mediterranean diet and the lower ter-
tile as away from this dietary pattern. Data
analysis revealed a consistent inverse relationship
between diet score and the odds of having acute
coronary syndromes.

There are also some other diet scores that
evaluate adoption of the Mediterranean dietary
pattern on subjects with chronic diseases [13,26e
31]. For example, Trichopoulou et al. [13] pro-
posed a small-scale diet score (0e9) that assessed
adherence to the Mediterranean diet. Applying this
score, researchers revealed an inverse association
between the Mediterranean diet and all-cause and
coronary heart disease mortality. In particular a 2/
9-point increment in the score was associated with
33% lower coronary heart disease risk [13]. More-
over, Martinez-Gonzalez et al. [26] have developed
also a 9-scale diet score that evaluated the rela-
tionship between adoption of the Mediterranean
diet and the odds of having myocardial infraction.
They found an 82% lower risk for those scoring 7e9
points in comparison with those scoring 1e2
points, while an increment of 1/9 point in the
score was associated with an 18% decline in the
relative risk of myocardial
infarction. Although
both diet scores were well documented and exten-
sively evaluated by the authors, the small range

and dispersion of the scales they used might result
in an overestimation of the decline in risk. In gen-
eral, small-scale scores are not so informative;
they fail to capture the extremes and the inherent
characteristics of a pattern or a behavior. More-
over, they might not give good predictions in cases
where the outcome is continuous and not binary
(like biological markers), because of their discrete
distribution.

Until now traditional analyses in the ﬁeld of
nutritional epidemiology typically examine health
status through a single or some nutrients or foods.
However, people eat meals consisting of a variety of
foods with complex combinations of nutrients. To
overcome the limitations of the single nutrient
approach, i.e. interactions and inter-correlation
among nutrients, scientists have proposed to study
overall dietary patterns [32]. In this paper we pro-
posed a diet score that evaluates adherence to the
Mediterranean diet. This score could be a useful
tool for the assessment of an individual’s nutritional
status and for clinical and basic research purposes.
