Objectives: Results of the relationships between dietary consumption of reﬁned grains
and the risk of stroke are mixed. This study was based on a meta-analysis of
prospective cohort studies. Methods: We systematically searched the MEDLINE (from
January 1, 1966) and EMBASE (from January 1, 1974) databases up to November
30, 2014. Random-effects models were used to calculate summary relative risks
(SRRs) and 95% conﬁdence intervals (CIs). Between-study heterogeneity was as-
sessed using Cochran’s Q and I2 statistics. Results: Eight prospective studies (7
publications) with a total of 410,821 subjects and 8284 stroke events were in-
cluded in the meta-analysis. Overall, a diet containing greater amounts of reﬁned
grains was not associated with risk of stroke, with no evidence of heterogeneity
among studies (SRR = 1.02; 95% CI, .93-1.10; Pheterogeneity = .970; I2 = 0). In addition,
no signiﬁcant associations between consumption of reﬁned grains and risk of stroke
were found for both women and men, for both hemorrhagic and ischemic strokes,
and for both incident and fatal strokes. These null results are consistent with those
of linear dose–response meta-analyses (SRR = .98; 95% CI, .73-1.03 for per 3 servings/
day). Consumption of white rice was not associated with risk of stroke (SRR = 1.01;
95% CI, .93-1.11; Pheterogeneity = .966; I2 = 0). Conclusions: The current meta-analysis
provides some evidence for the hypothesis that consumption of reﬁned grains
was not associated with risk of stroke and its subtypes. Key Words: Reﬁned
grains—hemorrhagic stroke—ischemic stroke—meta-analysis.

great health burden in future decades, consuming large
amounts of health resources and leading to signiﬁcant
economic burden.2 For instance, in the United States, it
is the fourth leading cause of mortality, with 795,000 es-
timated cases of incident stroke annually.3 It is, therefore,
imperative to identify and implement healthcare poli-
cies that can reduce the risk of stroke.4

A substantial body of evidence has shown that diet is
related to risk of stroke.4 Whole grain consists of 3 botani-
cally deﬁned parts: the bran, the germ, and the endosperm;
the former two parts (bran and germ) are sources of dietary
ﬁber and various micronutrients, minerals, and
phytochemicals. Reﬁned grains, which primarily consist of
starch, are produced when removing the outer bran and
germ portions of whole grains. It is reported that high intake
of reﬁned carbohydrates may be the reason why Asian popu-
lations tend to develop diabetes at a younger age and a
lower body mass index (BMI) than white populations.5 High
intake of energy-dense foods, such as reﬁned grains, has

adverse effects on lipid and glucose metabolism, thereby
creating potential worries with regard to increased risk of
weight gain/obesity, dyslipidemia, and hypertension,6,7 all
of which are major intermediate end points for stroke.

Several epidemiological studies have directly exam-
ined the relationship between consumption of reﬁned grains
and risk of stroke and its subtypes with inconsistent
results.8-14 Up to now, no systematic reviews and meta-
analyses have looked into the effects of consumption of
reﬁned grains on the risk of stroke. We therefore under-
took a meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies to
quantitatively assess such an association following the
Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiol-
ogy guidelines.15

Methods
Literature Search

Two investigators (W.D.M. and G.Y.X.) made a sys-
temic search of MEDLINE (from January 1, 1966) and
EMBASE (from January 1, 1974) up to November 30, 2014
to identify all published articles using the following medical
subject headings or key words: (1) cereals OR grains OR
rice OR sweets OR desserts OR white bread OR pasta
OR muffins OR biscuits OR pancakes OR waffles OR pizza;
(2) cerebrovascular accident OR brain ischemia OR in-
tracranial hemorrhages OR cerebral hemorrhage OR
subarachnoid hemorrhage OR stroke. The search was
limited to studies in English. Furthermore, the reference
lists of retrieved articles were scrutinized to identify ad-
ditional relevant studies.

Study Selection

The studies had to meet the following criteria to be
included in the meta-analysis: (1) the prospective cohort
studies were published as original articles; (2) the expo-
sure of interest was reﬁned grains or speciﬁc subtypes;
the outcome was nonfatal or fatal stroke and its sub-
types; and (3) the studies reported relative risks (RRs)
and corresponding 95% conﬁdence intervals (CIs) for at
least 3 quantitative categories of intake of reﬁned grains.
Case–control studies, animal studies, in vitro researches,
case reports, ecological studies, and reviews were not con-
sidered eligible. If multiple papers reported results from
the same cohort, we included the one with the largest
number of cases. Studies on foods that were based on
components of individual grains, such as bran or germ,
were excluded. W.D.M. and G.Y.X. independently re-
viewed all potentially relevant articles to determine whether
an article met the general inclusion criteria, and dis-
agreement was resolved by discussion.

Data Extraction

From each study, W.D.M. and G.Y.X. extracted the fol-
lowing characteristics: ﬁrst author’s surname, publication

2739

year, study location, duration of follow-up, number of
participants, participants’ age and sex, methods used for
collection of data on exposure, number of events, outcome
assessment, confounding factors, and RR estimates with
the corresponding 95% CI for the highest versus the lowest
category of intake of reﬁned grains. If separate risk es-
timates for men and women and for subtypes of stroke
were available in one study, we treated it as separate
studies.12,13 From each study, we extracted the risk esti-
mates with the greatest number of adjustments.

Assessment of Study Quality

W.D.M. and G.Y.X. assessed the quality of each se-
lected study using the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale (NOS).16
For cohort studies, the NOS consist of 3 parameters of
quality: selection (4 points), comparability (2 points), and
outcome (3 points); a maximum of 9 points reﬂect the
highest quality. A total score of 7 or greater indicated high-
quality studies and a total score of 6 or smaller indicated
low-quality studies.

Statistical Methods

We used the statistical program STATA, version 11.0
(STATA, College Station, TX) for the analysis. A two-
tailed P value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically
signiﬁcant. We used the method of a random-effects model,
which accounts for heterogeneity among studies,17 to cal-
culate summary relative risks (SRRs) and 95% CIs for the
high versus low and dose–response analysis. We con-
verted the RRs in each study by using their natural
logarithms, and the standard errors were calculated from
their corresponding 95% CIs. Publication bias was as-
sessed by using funnel plots and Begg’s adjusted rank
correlation and Egger’s regression asymmetry tests; results
were considered to indicate potential publication bias if
the P value is less than .10.18,19

Statistical heterogeneity among studies was assessed
using both the Q statistic and the I2. Results were con-
sidered signiﬁcantly heterogeneous if the P values are less
than .10. I2 is the amount of total variation that is ex-
plained by between-study variation, with values of
approximately 25%, 50%, and 75% considered to indi-
cate low, moderate, and high heterogeneity, respectively.20
To explore the sources of heterogeneity, subgroup and
metaregression analyses were performed according to sex;
geographic locations; duration of follow-up; number of
cases; stroke outcome; and adjustments for confound-
ing factors, including a history of type 2 diabetes,
dyslipidemia, and total energy intake. Sensitivity anal-
yses were performed by excluding one study from the
meta-analysis and calculating a pooled estimate for the
remainder of the studies to evaluate whether the results
were signiﬁcantly affected by a single study.

The dose–response results in the forest plots are pre-
sented for a 3-servings-per-day increment. We used the

which requires that the distribution of cases and noncases
and the RRs with the variance estimates for at least three
quantitative exposure categories are known. When this
information was not available, we estimated dose–
response slopes using variance-weighted least squares
regression.21,22 The median or mean level of intake of reﬁned
grains in each category of intake was assigned to the cor-
responding RR for each study. If such values were not
reported, we took the estimated midpoint between the
upper and lower boundaries in each category as the average
intake level. If the highest or lowest category was open-
ended, we assumed the size of the open-ended interval
to be the same as that of the adjacent interval. In studies
that reported the intakes in gram per day, we used 30 g
as a serving size for recalculation of the intakes to a common
scale (servings per day).23 We used 158 g as a serving size
for intake of white rice consistent with a recent study.24

Results
Search Results and Study Characteristics

The search strategy resulted in 703 citations, 33 of which
had potential value and were available as full-text ar-
ticles (Fig 1). No additional articles were included from
the reference reviews. In the review of these 33 articles,
26 were subsequently excluded from the meta-analysis
for various reasons. Therefore, a total of 7 articles with
8 prospective cohort studies (1 article14 contained 2 large
independent cohort studies: Japan Public Health Center-
based Study I and Japan Public Health Center-based Study
II) were included in the meta-analysis (Table 1).

The 8 studies (7 publications) were published between
1999 and 2014, and contained a total of 410,821 subjects

(ranged from 11,940 to 215,000) and 8284 stroke cases
(ranged from 146 to 3281). Of the 8 studies, four were
conducted in the United States8-11 and four in Japan.12-14
The studies from the United States reported for total reﬁned
grains and Japanese studies reported for consumption of
white rice. The duration of follow-up ranged from 5.5
to 15.2 years, with a median of 11 years. All studies used
the validated semiquantitative Food Frequency Ques-
tionnaire (FFQ) as a tool to collect dietary information.
All studies provided RR estimations adjusted by age, sex,
smoking, alcohol use, BMI, physical activity, and history
of hypertension or measured blood pressure. Most studies
provided RR estimations adjusted by a history of dia-
betes (6 studies) and total energy intake (6 studies), but
only 2 studies9,10 provided RR estimations adjusted by a
history of dyslipidemia (Table 1). According to NOS, all
studies were of high quality (NOS > 6).

Main Analyses

High versus Low Analysis

The summary RR was 1.02 (95% CI, .93-1.10) for sub-
jects in the highest category of consumption of reﬁned
grains compared with those in the lowest category, with
no evidence of heterogeneity among studies
(Pheterogeneity = .970, I2 = 0; Fig 2, A). Furthermore, meta-
analysis of the four studies (3 publications)12-14 found a
null association between consumption of white rice and
risk of stroke (SRR = 1.01; 95% CI, .93-1.11; Pheterogeneity = .966;
I2 = 0).

Sex

Two studies provided results speciﬁc for both men and
women,12,13 and 2 studies consisted entirely of women8,9

and 1 study of men.10 In the stratiﬁed analysis by sex,
no associations were found between consumption of reﬁned
grains and risk of stroke for both men and women (men:
SRR = 1.03, 95% CI .84-1.26, Pheterogeneity = .690, I2 = 0; women:
SRR = 1.04, 95% CI .85-1.27, Pheterogeneity = .707, I2 = 0).

Stroke Type

One study provided results speciﬁcally for ischemic
stroke and hemorrhagic stroke.13 Two studies reported
results only for ischemic stroke.9,11 The SRR was 1.04 (95%
CI, .91-1.19) for risk of ischemic stroke and 1.05 (95% CI,
.65-1.71) for hemorrhagic stroke. There was evidence of
signiﬁcant heterogeneity among the studies for hemor-
rhagic stroke (Pheterogeneity = .127, I2 = 51.6), but not for ischemic
stroke (Pheterogeneity = 0.701, I2 = 0).

Subgroup, Metaregression, and Sensitivity Analyses

Subgroup and metaregression analyses are shown in
Table 2. Nonsigniﬁcant associations were observed for
studies from the United States (SRR = 1.03; 95% CI, .81-
1.32; Pheterogeneity = .603; I2 = 0) and from Japan (SRR = 1.01;
95% CI, .93-1.11; Pheterogeneity = .966; I2 = 0). When we strati-
ﬁed analyses by stroke outcome, the SRR was 1.00 (95%
CI, .89-1.11) for incident stroke, and 1.04 (95% CI, .92-
1.18) for fetal stroke. In the stratiﬁed analyses by number
of cases or duration of follow-up, a null association was
found. In addition, whether or not adjusting for a history

of DM (Pdifference = 0.639), total energy intake (Pdifference = 0.639),
history of dyslipidemia (Pdifference = 0.727) did not signiﬁ-
cantly alter the null association between consumption of
reﬁned grains and risk of stroke.

To test the robustness of our results, we conducted
sensitivity analyses. Further exclusion of any single
study did not materially change the overall combined
RR, with a range from 1.01 (95% CI,
.92-1.10) to 1.03
(95% CI, .91-1.15). We then conducted a metaregression
analysis to investigate the impact of the above study
characteristics on the RRs and found that none of the
study characteristics signiﬁcantly altered the summary
risk association between consumption of reﬁned grains
and risk of stroke.

Dose–Response Analysis

Eight studies (7 publications) were included in the dose–
response analysis of consumption of reﬁned grains and
risk of stroke (Fig 2, B). The SRR per 3 servings/day was
(SRR = .98; 95% CI, .93-1.03), with no evidence of heter-
ogeneity (I2 = 10.2, Pheterogeneity = .349).

Publication Bias

For high versus low analysis of intake of reﬁned grains,
the P values were 0.874 for Egger’s test and 0.858 for Begg’s
test (Fig 3). This assessment, however, was based on 8
studies for intake of reﬁned grains.

Discussion

In the current meta-analysis, we found that increased
consumption of reﬁned grains is not associated with risk
of total stroke and its subtype, independent of a variety
of cardiovascular disease risk factors. In addition, no sig-
niﬁcant associations were found for both women and men,
and for both incident and fatal strokes. There was no ev-
idence of signiﬁcant heterogeneity among these studies.
These null results are consistent with those from linear
dose–response meta-analyses.

Because of the differences in etiologic mechanisms
between hemorrhagic and ischemic strokes,25 the associ-
ation between consumption of reﬁned grains and risk of
stroke may be somewhat masked by combining isch-
emic and hemorrhagic strokes in the analysis. However,
when we carried out analyses for hemorrhagic and isch-
emic strokes, respectively, a null association for both stroke
subtypes was observed, which indirectly strengthens the
observed null relation between reﬁned grains and total
risk of stroke.

It is biologically plausible that higher consumption of
reﬁned grains, which is typically energy-rich and nutrient-
poor, is associated with increased risk of stroke. Intake
of reﬁned grains can result in glycemia-induced oxida-
tive stress, inﬂammation, endothelial impairment, and vessel
dysfunction mediated by the formation of advanced
glycation end products,26,27 all of which may contribute
to higher risk of stroke.28,29 Epidemiological studies have
found that intake of reﬁned grains and high–energy-
dense foods was associated with an increased risk of
diabetes,7,24,30 hypertension,31 and dyslipidemia.31 However,
the majority of prospective studies have found no sig-
niﬁcant association between consumption of reﬁned grains
and risk of stroke.8 We considered several potential reasons
for the lack of an overall association between consump-
tion of reﬁned grains and risk of stroke. A meta-
analysis of 6 prospective cohort studies indicated that total

consumption of reﬁned grains did not lead to an in-
crease in type 2 diabetes, one of the most important
intermediate end points.23 Another possibility is that un-
healthy lifestyle factors associated with consumption of
reﬁned grains, such as smoking and physical inactivity
might have obscured a positive association between con-
sumption of reﬁned grains and risk of stroke.

Our meta-analysis has strengths as follows: (1) To the
best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst meta-analysis of
consumption of reﬁned grains and risk of stroke and its
subtypes, involving high versus low and linear dose–
response analysis. (2) This meta-analysis included only
prospective cohort studies with more than 4.1 million sub-
jects and 8000 cases of stroke and a long duration of follow-
up (median, 11 years). We therefore had adequate statistical
power to detect moderate associations. (3) All the studies
included in the meta-analysis evaluated multiple risk factors
for stroke including smoking, alcohol use, physical ac-
tivity, BMI, and its intermediate biomarkers (a history of
type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia).

The present meta-analysis has several limitations. First,
measurement errors are a problem in the assessment of
dietary intake and chronic disease risk.32,33 All the in-
cluded studies assessed consumption of reﬁned grains
according to the FFQ, which reﬂected the relatively low
correlations in validated studies (Spearman’s correla-
tion coefficient of 0.63 for white rice intake compared with
a four 3-day weighed dietary records34). Among the in-
cluded studies, only the Nurses’ Health Study9 had
repeated dietary assessment (every 4 years) during the
follow-up period, while in the other studies, the dietary
assessment was only made at baseline. All the included
studies were not uniform in the way they quantify and
classify dietary consumption: Four of 8 included studies
used all reﬁned grains as a category,8-11 and the other 4
studies (3 publications) reported risk estimations for white
rice.12-14 Such misclassiﬁcation may bias the results toward
the null and may partially explain the lack of an asso-
ciation between consumption of reﬁned grains and risk
of stroke in this study.

Second, residual confounding cannot be completely ruled
out due to the observational nature. Consumers of reﬁned
grains generally reported unhealthy lifestyle habits, in-
cluding less physical activity, smoking, higher intake of
red meat, and less intake of fruits and vegetables. These
results were consistent with some prospective studies,8,11,35
but not with the Iowa Women’s Health Study,35 which
reported an inverse association between intake of reﬁned
grains and consumption of red meat. Such unhealthy diets
and lifestyles have been shown to increase the risk of
stroke.36,37 Furthermore, intermediate end points (such as
diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, and hyperten-
sion) that occurred during the follow-up could have led
the participants to change their diet after being diag-
nosed with these conditions and, thus, may have
confounded the risk associations. However, most of the

REFINED GRAINS AND STROKE

known confounding factors were considered in the in-
cluded studies.

Third, while the number of stroke events is large, the
number of stroke subtypes is relatively small. Further-
more, our analysis is limited to data from only 2 countries,
United States and Japan. Thus, additional research on stroke
subtypes and in other populations is warranted to gen-
eralize our ﬁndings.

Finally, despite the extensive search made using the
MEDLINE and EMBASE databases and the observation
that there was no suggestion of bias using Begg’s and
the Egger’s tests, this meta-analysis is not immune to pub-
lication bias.

In conclusion, our meta-analysis of prospective cohort
studies suggests that higher intake of reﬁned grains is
not associated with the risk of stroke in both men and
women. However, the association needs further well-
designed investigations, especially some clinical trials, to
examine the effect of consumption of reﬁned grains on
the risk of stroke.
