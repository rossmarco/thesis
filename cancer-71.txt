Context Laboratory and epidemiological data suggest that folic acid may have an
antineoplastic effect in the large intestine.
Objective To assess the safety and efficacy of folic acid supplementation for pre-
venting colorectal adenomas.
Design, Setting, and Participants A double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2-factor,
phase 3, randomized clinical trial conducted at 9 clinical centers between July 6, 1994,
and October 1, 2004. Participants included 1021 men and women with a recent his-
tory of colorectal adenomas and no previous invasive large intestine carcinoma.
Intervention Participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive 1 mg/d
of folic acid (n=516) or placebo (n=505), and were separately randomized to receive
aspirin (81 or 325 mg/d) or placebo. Follow-up consisted of 2 colonoscopic surveil-
lance cycles (the first interval was at 3 years and the second at 3 or 5 years later).
Main Outcome Measures The primary outcome measure was occurrence of at
least 1 colorectal adenoma. Secondary outcomes were the occurrence of advanced
lesions (ⱖ25% villous features, high-grade dysplasia, size ⱖ1 cm, or invasive cancer)
and adenoma multiplicity (0, 1-2, or ⱖ3 adenomas).
Results During the first 3 years, 987 participants (96.7%) underwent colonoscopic
follow-up, and the incidence of at least 1 colorectal adenoma was 44.1% for folic acid
(n=221) and 42.4% for placebo (n=206) (unadjusted risk ratio [RR], 1.04; 95% con-
fidence interval [CI], 0.90-1.20; P=.58). Incidence of at least 1 advanced lesion was
11.4% for folic acid (n=57) and 8.6% for placebo (n=42) (unadjusted RR, 1.32; 95%
CI, 0.90-1.92; P=.15). A total of 607 participants (59.5%) underwent a second follow-
up, and the incidence of at least 1 colorectal adenoma was 41.9% for folic acid (n=127)
and 37.2% for placebo (n=113) (unadjusted RR, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.93-1.37; P=.23);
and incidence of at least 1 advanced lesion was 11.6% for folic acid (n=35) and 6.9%
for placebo (n=21) (unadjusted RR, 1.67; 95% CI, 1.00-2.80; P=.05). Folic acid was
associated with higher risks of having 3 or more adenomas and of noncolorectal can-
cers. There was no significant effect modification by sex, age, smoking, alcohol use,
body mass index, baseline plasma folate, or aspirin allocation.
Conclusions Folic acid at 1 mg/d does not reduce colorectal adenoma risk. Further
research is needed to investigate the possibility that folic acid supplementation might
increase the risk of colorectal neoplasia.

FOLIC ACID AND ITS DERIVATIVES

that even in well-nourished western
populations, folate supplementation re-
duces the risk of neural tube defects.2
Considerable epidemiological evi-
dence suggests that a low-folate diet is
associated with an increased risk of co-
lorectal neoplasia,3-5 particularly in con-
cert with alcohol, which can antago-
nize the metabolism of folate.6,7 Much

animal data support an antineoplastic
effect of folate. However, in some ani-
mal studies, folate deficiency protects
against, and supplementation in-
creases, experimental carcinogenesis.3

Nevertheless, on the whole, the bio-
logical and epidemiological evidence
supports the potential for folate supple-
mentation to prevent colorectal neo-
plasia in humans.

Adenomas are precursors of most co-
lorectal cancers8,9 and are an appropri-
ate end point for assessing efficacy of
chemopreventive agents against the de-
velopment of large intestine cancer. To
evaluate the chemopreventive effect of
folate in humans, we conducted a ran-
domized trial of folic acid supplemen-
tation, with and without aspirin, for the
prevention of new colorectal adeno-
mas in persons with a recent history of
these lesions.

METHODS
Study Design
The study design has been previously
described.10 In brief, the Aspirin/
Folate Polyp Prevention Study was a
double-blind, placebo-controlled, ran-
domized clinical trial of the efficacy of
oral aspirin, folic acid, or both to pre-
vent colorectal adenomas in persons
with a history of adenomas. Using a
3 ⫻2 factorial design, our study com-
pared 81 mg/d and 325 mg/d of aspi-
rin with placebo and 1 mg/d of folic acid
with placebo. Originally, the trial was
designed to investigate only aspirin, but
shortly after enrollment began, it was
expanded to examine folic acid (100 in-
dividuals were randomized before the
folic acid component was initiated). The
findings regarding aspirin have been
previously reported.10 In brief, we re-
ported that low-dose aspirin (81 mg/d)
had a moderate, statistically signifi-
cant chemopreventive effect, reduc-
ing the risk of colorectal adenomas by
19%, while high-dose aspirin (325
mg/d) provided no significant ben-
efit.10 This article focuses on folic acid.
The folic acid investigation was ini-
tially designed to parallel the investiga-
tion for aspirin, evaluating a 3-year treat-
ment period. However, because longer
exposure to folic acid might be re-
quired to observe an antineoplastic
effect,11 participants who underwent a
colonoscopy during the first follow-up
interval were invited to continue their

blinded randomized treatment (folic acid
or placebo) for an additional 3 or 5 years.
Because of the expected rapid effect of
aspirin, and the anticipated difficulty in
maintaining adherence, we did not at-
tempt to prolong the aspirin investiga-
tion. Our analysis of folic acid includes
both follow-up intervals.

The trial involved 9 clinical centers
(Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleve-
land, Ohio; University of Colorado
Health Sciences Center, Denver; Dart-
mouth-Hitchcock Medical Center,
Lebanon, NH; Henry Ford Health Sci-
ences Center, Detroit, Mich; Univer-
sity of Iowa College of Medicine, Iowa
City; University of Minnesota, Minne-
apolis; University of North Carolina
School of Medicine, Chapel Hill; Uni-
versity of Southern California, Los An-
geles; and University of Toronto,
Toronto, Ontario). An independent data
and safety monitoring committee re-
viewed the study semiannually. Hu-
man subjects committees at the clini-
cal centers approved the study protocol
and materials distributed to the par-
ticipants. All participants provided writ-
ten informed consent.

Study Population, Randomization,
and Interventions
Recruitment occurred between July 6,
1994, and March 20, 1998. Potential par-
ticipants were identified by clinical cen-
ter staff using colonoscopy and pathol-
ogy reports. Those participants eligible
were aged 21 to 80 years and had at least
1 of the following criteria: at least 1 his-
tologically confirmed adenoma re-
moved within 3 months before recruit-
ment, at least 1 histologically confirmed
adenoma removed within 16 months be-
fore recruitment and a lifetime history
of 2 or more confirmed adenomas, or a
histologically confirmed adenoma of at
least 1 cm in diameter removed within
16 months before recruitment. We re-
quired that each participant had a com-
plete colonoscopy, with removal of all
known polyps, within 3 months of en-
rollment. Exclusion criteria included a
history of familial polyposis syn-
dromes, invasive large intestine cancer,
malabsorption syndromes, any condi-

tion that could be worsened by supple-
mental aspirin or folic acid, and any con-
dition commonly treated with aspirin,
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or
folate (eg, recurrent arthritis, atheroscle-
rotic vascular disease, and folic acid de-
ficiency).10 To avoid the potential for fo-
late supplementation to mask vitamin B12
deficiency,12 we measured plasma vita-
min B12 levels in all participants before
randomization and excluded those with
evidence of deficiency (⬍162 pg/mL).
We also assayed methylmalonic acid in
those participants whose vitamin B12 lev-
els were marginal (162-366 pg/mL). Par-
ticipants having increased methylmalo-
nic acid (⬎396 nmol/L) were not
randomized. Additionally, participants
who required baseline methylmalonic
acid testing, and who were in the high-
est quintile of acceptable methylmalo-
nic acid at baseline, were retested be-
fore treatment continuation in the second
follow-up interval. Women of childbear-
ing potential had to provide agreement
to use effective birth control for the du-
ration of the study.

Participants completed a question-
naire regarding personal characteris-
tics, medical history, and lifestyle hab-
its. To describe the population of
participants, the questionnaire in-
quired about race/ethnicity using the
following categories: non-Hispanic
white, non-Hispanic black, Hispanic,
American Indian or Alaskan Native,
Asian or Pacific Islander, other (par-
ticipants specified using a text field),
and uncertain (no participants se-
lected this category).

After recruitment, participants be-
gan a 3-month, single-blind, run-in pe-
riod to assess tolerance of aspirin and
adherence with pill taking. During this
run-in period, participants received 325
mg/d of aspirin and a placebo tablet
identical in appearance to the folic acid
tablets. Run-in participants who re-
ported taking at least 80% of the tab-
lets and who wished to continue par-
ticipating underwent randomization.
We used a computer-generated ran-
domization in blocks of 6 to allocate
participants in a 1:1 ratio to 1 mg/d of
folic acid or placebo within strata de-

years vs ⬎60 years). The study was
double-blinded. Treatment assign-
ments were concealed from partici-
pants and study staff except for the
pharmacist technician and the statisti-
cal analyst (L.A.M.). Study tablets (pro-
vided by Wyeth Consumer Health Care,
Madison, NJ) were distributed in cal-
endar packs or bottles. Placebo tablets
were identical in appearance to folic
acid tablets. On October 1, 2004, fund-
ing for the folic acid treatment was dis-
continued, and participants were asked
to stop taking all study tablets by Oc-
tober 1, 2004. As originally planned, ex-
tended treatment and follow-up would
have ended December 31, 2006.

Follow-up
Adenoma occurrence was determined
by colonoscopy and pathology re-
view. Follow-up was conducted in 2 in-
tervals. The first interval corre-
sponded to the initial 3-year protocol,
in which participants were to undergo
a complete colonoscopy 34 to 40
months after the qualifying examina-
tion. The planned length of the sec-
ond follow-up interval was at the dis-
cretion of the participant’s physician
and was generally 3 or 5 years. When-
ever possible, participants who discon-
tinued taking study tablets were fol-
lowed up (in both intervals) for study
end points.

Participants were regularly coun-
seled regarding avoidance of folic acid–
containing supplements (as well as
avoidance of aspirin and other nonste-
roidal anti-inflammatory drugs during
the first study interval). During the first
follow-up interval, participants re-
ceived questionnaires every 4 months re-
garding adherence to study treatment;
use of medications, over-the-counter
drugs, and nutritional supplements; in-
testine procedures (in particular endos-
copy and surgery); and the occurrence
of symptoms, illnesses, and hospitaliza-
tions. During the second follow-up in-
terval, questionnaires were adminis-
tered every 4 months to participants who
continued taking study tablets and an-
nually to all other participants.

FOLIC ACID FOR THE PREVENTION OF COLORECTAL ADENOMAS

Important medical events reported by
participants were verified with medi-
cal record review. The follow-up pe-
riod for such events was from random-
ization until study withdrawal or
October 1, 2004, whichever occurred
first. Records for all large intestine pro-
cedures (endoscopy or surgery) were
obtained. Slides for all tissue removed
from the intestine were retrieved and
sent to a single study pathologist
(D.C.S.) for uniform review who clas-
sified lesions as neoplastic (adenoma-
tous, including sessile serrated adeno-
mas13) or nonneoplastic.

The primary outcome measure was
the occurrence of at least 1 colorectal
adenoma. Prespecified secondary out-
comes were advanced lesions (tubulo-
villous adenomas [25%-75% villous fea-
tures], villous adenomas [ⱖ75% villous
features], large adenomas [ⱖ1 cm in di-
ameter], adenomas with high-grade
dysplasia, or invasive cancer), ad-
enoma multiplicity (0, 1-2, or ⱖ3 ad-
enomas), and adverse events.

Plasma folate was evaluated at the
end of the first follow-up interval to as-
certain adherence with randomized
treatment. Plasma levels of vitamin B12
and folate were determined by micro-
biological assays using a chlorampheni-
col-resistant strain of Lactobacillus ca-
sei and colistin-sulfate resistant strain
of Lactobacillus leichmannii, respec-
tively.14,15 Methylmalonic acid16 and
total plasma homocysteine17 were as-
sayed by gas chromatography/mass
spectroscopy.

Statistical Analysis and Sample Size
Fisher exact and t tests were used for
comparisons between groups in cat-
egorical and continuous variables, re-
spectively. Analyses of adenoma occur-
rence were performed for each of the 2
follow-up intervals and for the 2 inter-
vals combined. The period of risk for the
first follow-up interval was from 1 year
after randomization through the 3-year
examination (including findings from in-
terim examinations, if any). If a 3-year
follow-up colonoscopy was not per-
formed, the last examination at least 1
year after randomization was used to

mark the end of the first follow-up in-
terval. The second follow-up interval
pertained to participants who under-
went a 3-year examination and was de-
fined as the time from the end of the first
interval through the first subsequent sur-
veillance colonoscopy or until October
1, 2004, whichever was earlier.

The predefined primary statistical
analysis was a ␹2 test comparing the risk
of 1 or more adenomas in the 2 treat-
ment groups. Unadjusted risk ratios
(RRs) and 95% confidence intervals
(CIs) were also used to compare folic
acid with placebo. Adjusted RRs were
obtained from generalized linear mod-
els in which age, sex, clinical center,
number of lifetime adenomas, dura-
tion of follow-up, and aspirin treat-
ment group were covariates. These
models used a natural logarithm link
function and Poisson distributed er-
rors and were adjusted for overdisper-
sion and underdispersion. The possi-
bility that baseline factors modified the
folic acid effect was assessed using in-
teraction terms and Wald tests. For ex-
ample, to evaluate whether random-
ized aspirin allocation modified the
effect of folic acid, we fit the regres-
sion model, including indicator vari-
ables for folic acid and aspirin dose as
well as appropriate interaction terms.
We then used a 2-df Wald test to test
for interaction. The following poten-
tial effect modifiers were considered:
sex, alcohol consumption (users vs
nonusers), smoking status (current and
former users vs nonusers), presence of
advanced lesions (none vs ⱖ1) at base-
line examinations, and the following co-
variates disaggregated at the median:
age (⬍57 vs ⱖ57 years), plasma folate
level (ⱕ8.4 vs ⬎8.4 ng/mL [ⱕ19.0 vs
⬎19.0 nmol/L]), and body mass in-
dex (calculated as weight in kilo-
grams divided by height in meters
squared, ⱕ26.7 vs ⬎26.7). Adenoma
multiplicity was assessed by grouping
participants as having 0, 1 to 2, or 3 or
more adenomas and using the ␹2 test
to compare the treatment groups.

We performed analyses on the in-
tention-to-treat population consisting
of all randomized participants who un-

derwent a follow-up examination, in-
cluding those who discontinued ran-
domized supplementation. In addition,
we used multiple imputation18 to esti-
mate the folic acid effect after imput-
ing missing examination data. The im-
putation used logistic regression to
model adenoma occurrence with the
following baseline covariates: age, sex,
clinical center, number of lifetime ad-
enomas, aspirin treatment, and folic
acid treatment. We imputed a suffi-
cient number of complete data sets to
achieve more than 99% relative effi-
ciency and combined the results using
established methods18 to provide sum-
mary RRs, 95% CIs, and P values. Fi-
nally, we considered the subset of par-
t i c i p a n t s w h o c o n t i n u e d t h e i r
randomized treatment into the sec-
ond follow-up interval. Two-sided
P⬍.05 was considered statistically sig-
nificant. All statistical analyses were per-
formed by using SAS version 9.1 (SAS
Institute, Cary, NC) and Stata version
9 (StataCorp LP, College Station, Tex).

During final data review, we discov-
ered that 3 participants did not satisfy
all initial eligibility criteria. Two par-
ticipants had low vitamin B12 levels
(⬍162 pg/mL) but were tested for
methylmalonic acid, and their methyl-
malonic acid levels were in the accept-
able range. One participant was en-
rolled on the basis of having had an
adenoma of at least 1 cm removed
within 16 months of recruitment, but
the actual size of the adenoma was less
than 1 cm. Six participants received
treatment in the second follow-up in-
terval despite either increased methyl-
malonic acid (n=2) or no methylma-
lonic acid testing (n=4). We analyzed
our primary outcome measure both in-
cluding and excluding these partici-
pants and found no appreciable differ-
ence in the results. Therefore, we
included these participants in all analy-
ses reported herein.

A sample size of 1000 participants
was selected to provide power of at least
80% to detect a risk reduction with as-

RESULTS
Participants, Follow-up,
and Adherence
Of the 1409 participants who began the
run-in period, 1021 underwent random-
ization in both the folic acid and aspirin
components of the study (FIGURE 1). An
additional 100 participants were ran-
domized only to the aspirin compo-
nent and are thus excluded from this
analysis. Of the 288 participants who
were not randomized, 73 (25.3%) had
bleeding or another possible adverse
event, 62 (21.5%) were unable to avoid
taking medication or supplements pro-
hibited by the study, 34 (11.8%) were
nonadherent, and the remaining 119
(41.3%) were excluded for other rea-
sons (1 participant died, 64 were found
to be ineligible, 28 had an intercur-
rent illness, and 26 declined to con-
tinue the study). A total of 505 partici-
pants were randomized to the placebo
group and 516 participants were ran-
domized to 1 mg/d of folic acid (with
or without aspirin). A total of 987 par-
ticipants (96.7%) underwent a fol-
low-up colonoscopy at least 1 year fol-
lowing randomization during the first
follow-up interval. The remaining 34
participants either died (n=9) or were
lost to follow-up (n = 25). The mean
(SD) time from randomization to
completion of the first follow-up inter-
val was 32.7 (3.6) months. A total of
926 participants (90.7%) participated
in the second follow-up interval (729
[71.4%] continued randomized folic
acid/placebo treatment and 197 [19.3%]
discontinued study tablets but agreed
to be followed up for study end points).
One participant was discontinued from
randomized treatment due to a high
methylmalonic acid level and was fol-
lowed up observationally. During the

pants died, 31 were lost to follow-up,
and 272 did not have an examination
before treatment was discontinued on
October 1, 2004. The remaining 607
participants (59.5%) completed the sec-
ond follow-up interval a mean (SD) of
41.8 (11.8) months after the 3-year fol-
low-up. Approximately, 50% of par-
ticipants in the second follow-up in-
terval had planned to undergo
colonoscopic follow-up 4 or less years
after the 3-year examination.

There were no important differ-
ences in the baseline characteristics be-
tween the folic acid and placebo groups
(TABLE 1). Reported adherence with the
study protocol was excellent (TABLE 2).
Overall, 87% of participants took their
allocated study pills at least 6 days per
week during the first follow-up inter-
val. Pill taking adherence decreased
during the second follow-up interval,
with 71% of participants taking study
pills at least 6 days per week. A signifi-
cant portion of this decrease was due
to lack of consent to extended proto-
col treatment. Avoidance of nonstudy
folic acid supplements was also excel-
lent, with 87% of participants avoid-
ing them completely during the first fol-
low-up interval. The use of folic acid
supplements was not restricted among
those participants who did not con-
sent to extended protocol treatment.
Thus, reported avoidance of folic acid
decreased to 73% during the second fol-
low-up interval.

Allocation to the folic acid group re-
sulted in a pronounced increase in
plasma folate and a modest decrease in
total plasma homocysteine. Fol-
low-up measurements (at the 3-year ex-
amination) for both folate and homo-
cysteine were available from 419
participants in the placebo group and
430 participants in the folic acid group.
Mean (SD) plasma folate increased from
10.4 (7.5) ng/mL at baseline to 13.2
(6.3) ng/mL at follow-up in the pla-
cebo group and from 10.5 (7.9) ng/mL
to 32.8 (15.8) ng/mL in the folic acid
group (P⬍.001). Mean (SD) plasma ho-
mocysteine decreased from 1.32 (0.39)
mg/L to 1.24 (0.34) mg/L in the pla-

FOLIC ACID FOR THE PREVENTION OF COLORECTAL ADENOMAS

cebo group and from 1.34 (0.40) mg/L
to 1.21 (0.30) mg/L in the folic acid
group (P=.02). Among participants in
the folic acid group, mean plasma fo-
late decreased as self-reported adher-
ence decreased. At the 3-year exami-
nation, the mean (SD) plasma folate was
33.3 (15.4) ng/mL among the 383 par-
ticipants in the folic acid group who re-
ported taking study tablets 6 to 7 days
per week and 25.7 (18.5) ng/mL among
the 31 participants in the folic acid
group who reported taking study tab-
lets less than 6 days per week (P=.009).

Primary Outcome Measure
In the first follow-up interval, adeno-
mas occurred in 206 participants
(42.4%) in the placebo group and 221
participants (44.1%) in the folic acid
group (unadjusted RR, 1.04; 95% CI,
0.90-1.20; P=.58) (TABLE 3). In the sec-
ond follow-up interval, adenomas oc-
curred in 113 participants (37.2%) in
the placebo group and 127 partici-
pants (41.9%) in the folic acid group
(unadjusted RR, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.93-
1.37; P=.23). Among the 607 partici-
pants with end point information in

both follow-up intervals, the ad-
enoma rate (any adenoma in either in-
terval) was 65.5% in the placebo group
and 71.3% in the folic acid group (RR,
1.09; 95% CI, 0.98-1.21; P=.12). Ad-
justment for age, sex, clinical center,
length of follow-up, number of life-
time adenomas at baseline, and ran-
domized aspirin treatment did not sub-
stantially affect these findings. Results
using multiple imputation to account
for missing follow-up examinations
were also similar.

We evaluated the folic acid effect in
subgroups defined by the following
baseline factors: sex, age, alcohol
intake, smoking status, plasma folate
level, body mass index, and presence/
absence of advanced lesions. There

was no significant effect modification
in either follow-up interval. We also
found no significant interaction
between folic acid and randomized
aspirin treatment (P=.24) (FIGURE 2).
However, the suggestion of an
increased risk with folic acid was
confined to participants not allocated
to aspirin.

The effect of folic acid supplemen-
tation among the 501 participants who
agreed to continue pill taking (folic acid
or placebo) in the second follow-up in-
terval (254 allocated to the placebo
group and 247 allocated to the folic acid
group) was similar to that in the inten-
tion-to-treat analysis. Within this sub-
group, adenomas occurred in 92 par-
ticipants (36.2%) in the placebo group

and 106 participants (42.9%) in the fo-
lic acid group (RR, 1.18; 95% CI, 0.95-
1.47; P=.13).

Secondary Outcome Measures
In both follow-up intervals, partici-
pants in the folic acid group tended to
have higher rates of advanced adeno-
mas and multiple adenomas (Table 3).
In the first follow-up interval, ad-
vanced lesions occurred in 42 partici-
pants (8.6%) in the placebo group and
57 participants (11.4%) in the folic acid
group (unadjusted RR, 1.32; 95% CI,
0.90-1.92; P=.15). The respective num-
bers in the second follow-up interval
were 21 (6.9%) and 35 (11.6%) for both
groups (unadjusted RR, 1.67; 95% CI,
1.00-2.80; P = .05). Among partici-
pants with follow-up information in
both intervals, the overall rate of ad-
vanced lesions (any advanced lesion in
either interval) was 17.1% in the pla-
cebo group and 23.1% in the folic acid
group (RR, 1.35; 95% CI, 0.98-1.86;
P = .07). Randomized aspirin treat-
ment did not significantly modify the
effect of folic acid on advanced adeno-
mas in the first follow-up interval
(P=.34) (Figure 2).

Three or more adenomas occurred in
38 participants (7.8%) in the placebo
group and 47 participants (9.4%) in the
folic acid group in the first follow-up
interval (unadjusted RR, 1.20; 95% CI,
0.80-1.81; P=.38). The respective rates
in the second follow-up interval were
13 (4.3%) and 30 (9.9%) for both
groups (unadjusted RR, 2.32; 95% CI,
1.23-4.35; P=.007).

sis was restricted to the 501 partici-
pants who agreed to extended treat-
ment with folic acid or placebo in the
second follow-up interval. In this sub-
group, advanced lesions occurred in 18
participants (7.1%) in the placebo group
and 29 participants (11.7%) in the fo-
lic acid group (RR, 1.66; 95% CI, 0.95-
2.90; P = .08); and 3 or more adeno-
mas occurred in 11 participants (4.3%)
in the placebo group and 27 partici-
pants (10.9%) in the folic acid group
(RR, 2.52; 95% CI, 1.28-4.98; P=.008).
We evaluated the folic acid impact on
sessile serrated adenomas and found no
significant effect in either follow-up in-
terval. In the first follow-up interval, ses-
sile serrated adenomas occurred in 43
participants (8.9%) in the placebo group
and 54 participants (10.8%) in the folic
acid group (RR, 1.22; 95% CI, 0.83-
1.78; P=.31). In the second follow-up in-
terval, sessile serrated adenomas oc-
curred in 11 participants (3.6%) in the
placebo group and 17 participants (5.6%)
in the folic acid group (RR, 1.55; 95% CI,
0.74-3.26; P=.25).

No significant association was found
between allocation to folic acid and
risks of death, colorectal cancer, myo-
cardial infarction, coronary revascular-
ization, or stroke (TABLE 4). A higher
rate of noncolorectal cancers was ob-
served among participants allocated to
the folic acid group (54 [10.5%] vs 32
[6.3%], respectively; P=.02). This dif-
ference was due to an excess of pros-
tate cancer, with 24 cases (7.3%) in the
folic acid group and 9 cases (2.8%) in
the placebo group (P=.01).

COMMENT
In this double-blind, placebo-con-
trolled, randomized clinical trial, we
found that folic acid supplementation
did not decrease the risk of adenoma oc-
currence among participants with a re-
cent history of adenomas. There was no
evidence of benefit even among sub-
groups that might be considered sensi-
tive to the chemopreventive effects of fo-
late, such as those participants with low
baseline folate status, those partici-
pants who drank alcohol, and cigarette

FOLIC ACID FOR THE PREVENTION OF COLORECTAL ADENOMAS

smokers. Indeed, there was a sugges-
tion of an increase in risk for advanced
lesions and in adenoma multiplicity
among those participants randomized to
the folic acid group.

Our results may have been affected by
fortification of the food supply with fo-
late, which began in 1996, shortly after
enrollment in this study was initiated,
and became mandatory in 1998, largely
to reduce the risks of neural tube de-
fects by increasing maternal folate lev-
els during early pregnancy.19 The forti-
fication levels (an average of 140 µg per
100 g of grain product) were expected
to increase dietary folate intake by 70 to
120 µg/d in middle-aged and older
adults.20 Although this is only a frac-
tion of the amount in our supplement,
it is possible that by increasing the floor
folate status of our participants, as well
as increasing the peak folate levels in
those receiving active treatment, forti-
fication may have altered the impact of
our supplement. This is consistent with
a recent observational study that found
that adenoma risk is inversely associ-
ated with plasma folate levels only
among individuals not taking multivi-

tamins, a group with lower folate sta-
tus than multivitamin users.21 The in-
crease in plasma folate and the decrease
in total plasma homocysteine over time
in our placebo group was likely due to
folate fortification and probably under-
lies the modest change in homocyste-
ine in the folic acid group. These data
clearly indicate that we conducted our
study in a folate-replete population.

Previous research regarding the effect
of folate on carcinogenesis is difficult to
integrate into one coherent picture. Ani-
mal studies have provided conflicting evi-
dence, suggesting that folate may have
a dual effect on carcinogenesis, protect-
ing normal mucosa, but enhancing pro-
gression of early lesions.3 Although some
animal studies reported that folate defi-
ciency enhances experimental carcino-
genesis,22,23 other evidence suggests that
deficiency may reduce the develop-
ment of colorectal cancer.24,25 Similarly,
an animal study reported that supple-
mentation above nutritional require-
ments may limit intestine carcinogen-
esis,23 although other findings reported
an increase in risk.25,26 Evidence also ex-
ists suggesting that aggressive supple-

mentation may enhance the growth of
established, microscopic lesions.23 Over-
all, epidemiological data from cohort and
case-control studies have tended to find
folate intake to be inversely associated
with risks of colorectal cancer4 and ad-
enomas.4,27-32 Analyses of red blood cell
or serum folate levels also largely sug-
gest a protective effect of folate on the
risk of colorectal cancer or adeno-
mas,31,33-35 although data have not been
entirely consistent.36,37

One hypothesis to explain the pur-
ported chemopreventive properties of fo-
late pertains to DNA methylation, which
can have strong effects on gene expres-
sion38 and implications for the suscep-
tibility of DNA to damage.39 Overall, ge-
nomic hypomethylation is one of the
earliest molecular abnormalities in hu-
man colorectal neoplasia,40,41 observed
even in small adenomas.40-43 Because fo-
late is an important factor for the trans-
fer of methyl groups, it is critical to DNA
methylation. Low folate status may also
contribute to imbalances in nucleotide
pools, DNA strand breaks, and muta-
tions.44 The pathway that may be most
relevant for the development of colo-
rectal cancer in the setting of methyl-
ation disturbances is the serrated polyp,
which is associated with a higher preva-
lence of CpG island methylator pheno-
type45; however, we found no folic acid
effect on sessile serrated adenoma oc-
currence.

We found no clear evidence that fo-
lic acid supplementation provided any
health benefits. Although a significant ex-
cess of prostate cancers was observed in
the folate group, this might be spurious
given the number of adverse events
evaluated. A recent randomized trial of
folic acid in combination with B vita-
mins for vascular disease also sug-
gested that treatment with these agents
may increase the risk of colon cancer
(RR, 1.36; 95% CI, 0.89-2.08; P=.16) and
prostate cancer (RR, 1.21; 95% CI, 0.86-
1.72; P=.28), although these results were
not statistically significant.46 Observa-
tional studies regarding prostate cancer
have been mixed. Some studies re-
ported an increased risk of prostate can-
cer in association with high folate in-

take or blood levels, but these results
were not statistically significant or were
limited to early-stage cancers.47-49 A case-
control study reported a statistically sig-
nificant, favorable role of dietary folate
on prostate cancer risk.50

In conclusion, our study indicates
that folate, when administered as folic
acid for up to 6 years, does not de-
crease the risk of adenoma formation
in the large intestine among individu-
als with previously removed adeno-
mas. The evidence for an increased risk
of adenomas is equivocal and requires
further research. In view of the fortifi-
cation of the US food supply with fo-
late, and some suggestions that folate
could conceivably increase the risk of
neoplasia even outside the colorec-
tum,51-55 this line of investigation should
have a high priority.
